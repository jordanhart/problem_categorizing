So lets go in another direction.I am a photographer who uses a Canon 5D2  DSLR with the Canon 24-70mm L lens as my every-day setup.  It yields superb images for this format.But, after years of using this combo, you start to feel weighed down ... I needed an alternative to \"shlepping\" this setup when going on a casual hike or family outing. I ALSO wanted a backup to the Canon 5D2 for those photo trips/assignments where the Canon setup might become inoperative ... sure, I could get another 5D2 body and get weighed down even MORE ... no thanks.My solution, at this time, is the Panasonic Lumix G3.  For now I use it with the 14-140mm Panny OIS zoom lens (I don't particularly like the kit lens that comes with the camera). I also particularly like the Panny 20mm f/1.7 lens which is tiny.  The G3 is NO Canon 5D2, BUT it is very convenient and the images are very good compared to what most lightweight cameras can do.  It took me awhile to be confident enough to trust this camera for images that I care about capturing, but it does a pretty good job considering the relatively low price of admission.YES, there may be better small cameras coming out (usually you're obsolete in 4 months after your purchase of a small camera).The Sony NEX-7 looks promising.  If it lives up to its promise, it will probably edge out the G3 in image quality, BUT at twice the price.The inexpensive G3 fills a niche for me: as a fun camera which I have confidence in and as a backup for my DSLR.  The 4 stars represents the combination of G3 value and performance for me at this point in time.  And lets not forget the G3's \"fun\" factor.UPDATE March 2012:  I've purchased Panasonic's new micro 4/3  14-42mm \"Power\" \"X\" zoom lens from Amazon and it has become my new walking around lens. The quality of the images that this lens produces is remarkable, certainly exceeding my expectations.  Now I trust this camera/lens combination even more than before.  This new lens/camera combo requires a Panasonic firmware update for best performance, but it's very easy to do.  The zoom lever is necessarily on the lens and that position takes a bit of getting used to, but it is silent and the lens zoom is right in the range that I prefer.  Bravo. I raise my rating to 5 stars with the proviso that this new setup is still no 5D2, but is great for what it is.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally the True Heir to the GF1.  Another winner from Panasonic", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q0XY71FK4WS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you look at the controls on the G3 they look remarkable similarIf you have looked on with dismay as Panasonic abandoned the enthusiast small M4/3 and instead chases a smaller and smaller and dumber and dumber form factor with the GF line, then you now have a reason to be happy.  It appears Panasonic is positioning the G3 as the successor to the GF1.  They might not know that but that is how I view it.  Viewed as a replacement to the G2, the G3 is a bit of a let down.  Much the way the GF2 was compared to the GF1.  However, the G3 is a great replacement to the GF1.  It is a little bigger but not that much.  The physical controls are the same but now there is touch screen controls and to make up for many of the missing physical controls there are the C1 and C2 modes on the mode selector.  a Before continuing something that very few people seem to understand with these camera systems is the lens, not the camera body, determines how big the camera is.  I will use extremes to illustrate the point.  Put a 14mm f/2.5 on a GH2 and it seems very small.  You can't put it in a shirt pocket but it will fit inside a jacket pocket.  Also, you can get it in a very small carry case.  It is so small and light I use a wrist strap and not a neck strap.  Put a 100-300mm on a GF3 and it is going to be huge and because of the form factor really unusable.The first thing to note about the G3 is the price is $699.  That is $100 cheaper than the G1 or G2 at launch and $200 cheaper than the GF1.  In addition to being $200 cheaper than the GF1, the G3 has a built in EVF (would have been nicer rangefinder style) and a swivel screen.Another nice change from the G2 and the GF line is the new sensor.  Panasonic and Olympus have been using a 3 generation old sensor in every m4/3 line except the GH line.  The G3 now has a new 16mp sensor and updated image processing engine.  The G3 takes slightly better pictures than the GH2.As far as IQ goes, the m4/3 are not as good as DX sensors and they never will be as good.  The same way as DX sensors will never be as good as FX sensors.  All else being equal.  With that said, IQ merits some discussion as most people don't really understand it and most \"professional\" review sites confuse the whole issue.  Here is everything you need to understand on the issue.  First every generation of sensors the differences between m4/3, DX, and FX decreases.  At some point the difference become negligible.  Where that point is depends on what you want to do.  IQ is very dependent on the size of what you are going to do with the image.  I think for the vast majority of what people are doing, the differences are already negligible.  Here are a couple of examples of what I mean.  The biggest of computer monitors is right at 3.6mp.  Most are around 2mp.  That means to view a medium format 40mp image on a (2mp) monitor you are only using 5% of the image data.  The rest is getting thrown away.  For a 16mp image you are using 12.5% of the data.  So that means noise, detail etc is getting thrown away as you deres the image.  The same goes with printing.  The human eye can see 200-300 dots per inch (A useful piece of information is monitors used to be 72 dpi and are somewhere around 96 dpi.  That means if you blow an image up to 100% on your computer screen you are effectively magnifying by 2 to 3.  Therefore, the images at 100% on the computer monitor are not going to look as good as on paper)  Using 200 dpi, that means you need 2000x1600 pixels to print a decent 8x10.  If you do the math that means you need 3.2mp to print an 8x10.  (At 300 dpi you would need 7.2mp)  That means for a 16mp image you are using 20% of the data.  If this fits what you are doing, then any IQ differences are not important for you.  As you start printing larger than this, the difference can be noticeable.Where these m4/3 cameras excel is handling.  The GH2 is the king, in my opinion, for handling.  The controls are so well laid out it is a breeze to do anything you want quickly.  Additionally, the contrast based auto focus is so fast, that live view is exceedingly useable.  The swivel screen gives you huge options over a hold up to the eye only or a fixed back screen.  You can hold the camera way over your head or way down by your feet and still frame the image.On top of that is the light weight.  It has gotten to the point that I don't travel with my Nikon D7000 at all.  I only keep and use that for portrait/wedding/event type photography (I did however just shoot a wedding with m4/3 only.  The 100-300 was my primary lens.  It is a little slow but still grabbed some amazing shots).  I usually travel with 2 GH series bodies, 5-8 lenses, and an iPad all in a Domke F4 bag.  (With my G3 I will now travel with 3 bodies)  All of this weighs right around 10 lbs.  You could also just carry the 7-14, 14-140, and 100-300 lenses and cover from 14mm to 600mm equivalent with 3 lenses.  All of these lenses can be attached to 3 camera bodies and in the F4.  You could even add a 4th body and add the 20mm f/1.4.  That would still fit in the F4 and weigh in around 10lbs.I don't really do that much with video so I am not really going to comment that much on it.  However, video on the G3 is far easier and more useable than any DSLR except for the Sony A33/55.  Also, there is a built in stereo mic but no external connector.  I don't think the latter is big deal for most people.Construction on the G3 is very nice.  It is the first of panasonic m4/3 which uses aluminum in the construction instead of all plastic.Handgrip.  I am a little disappointed at the loss of the handgrip as it is essentially free.  I am still not sure how I feel about the new hand \"bump\" especially for the bigger lenses.  I will have to report on that one later.  If you are coming from a GF1 then this is a step up.  Since the old handgrip was shorter than the shortest lens, I am not sure what we are really gaining by this.  It also means the loss of space for the battery so Panasonic had to use a smaller battery.  I believe it is the same as the GF2.  The smaller batteries means less pictures so make sure you have a spare.  It is rated at 270 shots but a secret with Panasonic m4/3 is to turn your camera off after shooting.  Doing that I get around 750-800 shots.  I also have the auto review switched off.For anyone who is new to a more complicated camera, Panasonic has two very cool features to make it a little easier to use.  The first is Program shift mode and the newest one, only on the G3 right now, is iAuto+.  The program shift mode obsoletes the Aperture priority mode.  As you press the button half way down to get the exposer numbers.  You can then rotate the thumbwheel to goto a bigger aperture (smaller DOF) or larger aperture (larger DOF).  The iAuto+ now allows you to adjust white balance, exposure compensation, and aperture (defocus control).  This is a very handy feature and is good for the expert and beginner alike.  For the expert you can now stay in iAuto more often when in a fast moving shooting situation.  The camera will recognize the scene and make hundreds of changes to make the scene look best as possible.  You can now easily change the exposure and work the aperture.  For the beginner, you can start in iA.  After getting comfortable with that you can now start playing with aperture and exposure (the 2 most important controls in my opinion) while still having the \"safety\" of iAuto.  When you get more comfortable with that then moving to P mode is an easy jump.  With program shift there are not many reasons to shift over to A or M mode but when you need to it is there for you.Auto ISO and iAuto ISO.  Auto is based on light level and iAuto is based on light level and movement of subject.MF Assist  The manual focus for m4/3 lenses is fly-by-wire.  That means there are no stops.  On the first generation G bodies it was horrible.  On second generation Panasonic added a scale marker which was really nice.  On this generation, Panasonic added picture in picture for manual focus assist.  This is a really nice feature as I can focus and frame at the same time.  The m4/3 allows the use of just about any lens made.  However, you lose auto focus.  So for those with old film lenses there is probably an adaptor that can allow it to fit on the m4/3.  For that purpose and when auto focus has trouble the new manual focus assist is very nice.I mentioned before the loss of physical controls on the camera.  For enthusiast this is a step backwards.  For newbies this is probably a good thing.  The touch screen implementation is very nice but I am still not convinced I like it better than physical controls.  However, for enthusiast the loss of these controls is partially made up for with the C1 and C2 modes.  Now before you get into the fray, you can set the camera up for 2 custom modes and then just switch between the modes.  Therefore, you don't need to do as much fiddling.  Also, Q menu and Display buttons are now programmable functions buttons.  Therefore, if there is some function you use a lot and can't get to easily, now you can put it on one of these buttons.  Panasonic's menus aren't that great.  So I recommend leaving the Q menu button as is.  It relieves a ton of scrolling through menus.  I rarely ever use the Display button, I think the most I use it is when I am trying to go back to the display I want after it was accidentally touched.A big loss is the auto switch between EVF and screen.  On the previous Gs and GHs, there was a sensor to determine if your eye was up to the EVF.  If so it switched off the back screen and switched on the EVF.  Now you will have to use the button to switch.  Bad move from my perspective.  However, if you are coming from a GF1 or P+S, the fact that it has an EVF is a big plus.Overall,  this camera has amazing capabilities in a small light and easily accessible package.  The handling on these cameras is amazing and the camera gets out of the way to let you do what you want to do.  This camera has so many capabilities there is no way to review them all in one of these reviews.  If you have any specific questions, please ask in a comment and I will get back with you as soon as possible.I have the Red version.  My wife says with the RED version of the G3 you can't help but smile when you see it.  So I am hoping for some great pictures.ProsAmazing handling - Not as good as GH2 but almost - For me GH2 is best in the business for handlingSmall- Not pocketable but then again neither is the G12, LX5, OZ1, or P7000 and this camera spanks all of the above mentioned cameras for IQ and features.LightNice construction - Some aluminumNice new feature set (focus assist, iAuto+, C1+2, F1+2, etc)Nice new sensorBest high ISO of any m4/3 so far - ISO 1600 JPGs good and ISO 3200 usable for on screenVery good GF1 replacementConsNo auto switch between back screen and EVF.  This is almost unforgivable and is a huge pain.  However, seeing that DSLRs don't have auto switch and neither does most anything else besides the Panasonic line, it should not be a deciding factor.  Just a big irritation for no reason.Disappointing G2 replacement - Panasonic still has yet to make a high end enthusiast/pro stills focused camera.Same mediocre shutter specs - 1/4000 and 1/160 or worse flash syncNo electronic shutterIQ not as good as DX or better (However, better than my 3 year old DX Nikon D300)Smaller battery due to loss of gripNo social networking featuresBuying ConsiderationsSomeone Stepping Up to a \"DSLR\" category cameraOf the Panasonic m4/3 this is a great one to start with.  Lots of features but accessible.  The only other m4/3 I would currently consider is either of the GH cameras.  (GH1 is $399 for body only).  Olympus still has 3 generation old sensor and molasses slow focus.  (From what I have seen, Olympus is about to announce a new PEN camera that uses a new 12mp (I am glad they are stopping at 12 as that is more than enough) and new lenses that feature blazing fast autofocus (faster than the G3).  If it pans out it could be the new camera to own.  Of note, Olympus made the Pro lenses for the 4/5 cameras and they were great.  They are bringing out a 12mm f/2.8 for $800.  So this is going to be for enthusiast or pros.)Someone who already Owns a M4/3For the G1 and GH1 this is a very good trade up.  Skipping each generation is actually a good technique.  The G2 was a huge disappointment for me so this even makes sense as an upgrade over the G2 since that camera had the same sensor as the G1.  None of the Olympus has an EVF built in or a swivel screen.  They do have better IQ generally and internal image stabilization.  The autofocus is also really slow.  To me the handling and auto focus speed trump the other considerations so I think the Panasonic is better.  Others prefer the cache of the PEN.  If it is form over function, then stick with PEN otherwise G3.  Do take note of what I wrote above about new PEN.Someone who owns a DSLR and is tired of lugging the weight and wants a portable high quality camera.This is a great choice.  The price is only $200 more than the advanced compact cameras.  None of them can approach the G3 for what it can do.  It is not pocketable but neither are they.  A G3 with the 14mm, 25mm, and 45mm primes makes for a very lightweight and portable system that can cover just about any situation.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera With Lots Of Features", "Author": "E.

I am a serious digital outdoor/travel photographer but tired of traveling with 28+ pounds of pro. level equipment.  I was looking for a \"go light\" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down to the Panasonic Lumix G-3 or Olympus Pen.  The Panasonic won the contest because it has both and high quality LCD screen AND a high quality viewfinder (although it is electronic not optical.)  In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.  The only serious limitation is with the available reasonably priced lenses, the are relatively slow compared to more expensive 35mm camera lenses.

One little known feature of the Panny G-series is that it has really generous exposure auto-bracketing. The G1 and G2 will auto-bracket 7 exposures at 2/3 of an f-stop (so total +-2). The G3 expands that to a full f-stop per bracket for a total +-3, and to that you add greatly improved high-ISO performance. So unquestionably the best hand-held HDR camera on the planet. It also has a pretty decent in-camera HDR feature.I actually prefer the handling of my G1 to this G3. The G1 has a little bit bigger bump on the right side and the surface is a nice grippy rubber. This camera is much smaller and made of slippery enameled metal. They also stripped off some of the hardware controls from the G1 -- you have to do more with menus in the G3, which is a pity.But everything else that I love about the G1 is there in the G3. The picture resolution is remarkable -- comparable to a Canon T2i/T3i, which is to say it captures as much detail as you're going to get short of lugging around a $3,000 full frame DSLR. (a good place to see this in action is the Imaging Resources Comparometer -- just google it and try it out. The G3's resolution is better, somehow, than the average consumer DSLR.)The Panny lenses are expensive but almost without exception terrific. The 14-45 (which shipped with the G1 and can be bought separately; much better than the 14-42 that ships with the G3 kit) is just a wonderful walking around lens, small, versatile and razor sharp.The downside of the G1 is speed in medium and low light. So it wouldn't be your best camera for sports indoors or on a cloudy day. The G3's low light performance is so much improved it may have closed that gap, but you do your own research on that point -- I don't shoot sports or a lot of birthday parties.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic image quality from a modest sized camera", "Author": "Peter G.

The G3 is a step up with higher resolution, slightly better noise, and a truly usable touch-screen interface. The Lumix lenses are top-notch, too.

I moved \"down\" from a Canon 450d with 4 lenses (17-70mm f2.8 Sigma, 50mm f1.8 Canon, 70-300mm Canon and a 10-22mm Canon)due to bulk and enormous weight that was burdensome on vacation and even on local trips.  I wanted to downsize and could not see the point in going with a micro 2/3rds without a built-in, no extra cost, viewfinder when the G3 was available with a free viewfinder and a swivel screen.  The downsize  has been bliss as I now have the G3 body plus the 14-45mm MIJ \"kit +\" lens and a superlative 45-200mm.  It all fits in a kit bag about one third of the size of my Canon gear and the weight saving is extreme--no more aching back and neck. Viewing the pictures on a 42 inch high end Panasonic Neo-Plasma and the results are every bit as good as my Canon--maybe even a little better with more contrast and slightly sharper.  The ability to take HD movies without the complications of a mirror opens up a new world and the results are extremely good.  The touch screen was daunting at first but once you have used it once or twice it becomes second nature and extremely easy to use.  The ability to move around focusing areas according to order is a big plus for me.Downside:  Battery life is very poor and you will need to buy a decent cheapo on Amazon--mine is just as good as the rip-off factory offering.  The EVF is not as good as a glass pentaprism on an SLR.  But the EVF on the G3 gives a huge view and once you get used to it you do not really miss the old system. If you are into easily blurred backgrounds you will find depth of field is much larger the smaller the sensor. Panasonic lenses are very expensive-but quality does seem a cut above the prosumer plastic Canon and Nikon put out.  TBH, I found my Sigma 17-70mm f2.8-4 to be vastly superior to the standard kit offerings from Canon or Nikon. You can opt for equally excellent Olympus 2/3rds glass but you lose on the image stabilising facility as Olys have it built into the body.If bulk and weight were not an issue, I would probably have stayed with Canon (upgraded to T4i/650d) but I really wanted to downsize and I give the G3 a highly recommended score.  Now that I have become used to the huge weight saving I would never go back to a larger camera.  The price as of writing is bargain basement and that is probably because the G5 is out and it does not seem to offer much more other than a slighly larger body (a negative), better battery life and a useful AE lock button.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price?", "Author": "Juan Grande", "ReviewID": "R25NBRN7L5WEZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned in the past, the canon 20-30-40-D w/24-70 2.8L and 70-200 2.8 L IS and a 100mm 2.8 macro. I sold them 3 yrs. ago because I never took them anywhere! 2 months ago I discovered for myself the m4/3 system. I bought a G3 and the 14mm 2.5. Since then I've added the 25mm PL and the 45 1.8 Oly. These lenses w/ the G3 are equal in every way to that previous system( not the same focal length)  except I actually take them, in a small shoulder bag, everywhere! With the addition of several high quality lenses ( I lust for the 60mm Oly macro and the 75mm 1.8 Oly) you can make a wonderful kit. And, at $299, the G3 is going to be my 2nd body also. The G5 is intriguing @ $499, but I really want an OMD-EM5. However with the pace of advancement in this genre of camera systems, I've decided to wait a while for better prices ( 6 mo. perhaps). The G3 has  wonderful ergonomics for advance camera usage, an excellent electronic viewfinder and a nifty articulating screen with touch function abilities( touch focus and shoot is awesome)! Probably its only drawback is low light usage even with fast lenses. I'd expect significant advances in the sensor over the next 1-2 yrs.  The EM5 has a better sensor and in-body stabilization, which is its advantage and why I want one. But at 3-4 times the price of the G3, I'll wait! Some might say, \" why not the epm2 or the epl-5?\".

My only other micro four thirds camera is an E-PL1, which I had bought refurbished to see if I liked the format. I leaned towards Olympus at first because of the built in Optical Image Stabilization, which I consider rather important.  But after purchasing two Panasonic telephoto lenses with built in O.I.S., I saw this camera on sale, body only, and with a built in viewfinder and a flash realized it had a lot going for it so I bought it.Overall I am quite pleased. I like to shoot flying gulls, and this camera focuses on them quickly. Sometimes I prefocus on the water under them and then lift up to the birds to get the approximate distance down as that helps on distant birds.  The pictures it takes are sharp and usually well-exposed. If not one can play with exposure compensation as needed. The buttons are mostly well-placed. Maybe a little close together but that cannot be helped with a camera this size. and the wheel on the back is quite useful, as is the touch screen. I thought touching the screen to focus and take a picture in one step was sort of a gimmick, until I used it, now I consider it a great feature.The only thing that annoys me with the camera is the placement of the video button. I have made quite a few movies by accident. I understand it has been moved on the G5, which is good. But this camera was less than half the price of that one when I purchased it, so needing to erase a movie now and then is no big deal.In conclusion, there may be better micro four thirds cameras in some respects, but this one takes very fine pictures and if you can find one for a good price it is well worth purchasing.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cost less than the last 4/3 camera I bought, has more features", "Author": "ernie", "ReviewID": "R2ERYEDXD9YVO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Paid almost three times as much for a Lumix G1 a couple of years ago that has less resolution, no viewfinder, non-orientable LCD monitor.

Great system but the lenses are not really supported any more by newer bodies as Olympus has gone to micro 4/3. I had heard good things about Panasonic and Olympus and the small size appealed to me. I have an active 2 year old and I wanted a high quality camera that also took video and was lightweight and easy to use; yet had a fast shutter and took great pictures.Enter micro 4/3. The web has a wealth of in-depth reviews of almost all cameras. People really are enthusiasts when it comes to photography. So I would check those out. Right now this camera is an absolute steal. I actually went for a body only and then the kit lens 14-42 sold here so I can comment on both. I bought the E-Volt when it was a couple of years old and you can really get great value if you are willing to take that approach.The G3 has exceeded my expectations. It takes crisp, vivid, detailed pictures with very accurate colors. The 'contrast' focusing is very fast. The G3 has a lot of great features. One of the best is the intelligent auto. You have 2 options. One that does almost everything and another one where you can select depth of field, white balance, and under or over exposure the picture. A great design element that I think EVERY camera manufacture should follow is that there is not a separate mode on the mode dial for getting into intelligent auto. Rather there is a button that changes any of the modes into intelligent auto. So if you like aperture priority you can stay on that and then just hit and un-hit the button to get into the auto mode whenever you like.Another great feature is the viewfinder. The screen is great. It swivels, it is high quality you can touch it to focus and even use it as a shutter. But the electronic viewfinder is great, especially with a telephoto lens. The trade of this though is that it is not as compact as some of the other 4/3. But it is still more compact and lighter than any DSLR.Great video. I have the kit lens and also the Vario PZ 45-175mm. That lens takes better video than any camcorder I have ever used. Extremely good outdoor video. Good indoor video.If you are interested in just the body you are probably interested in lenses. I will review the 2 I have right now plus some other choices that you will find many reviews here on Amazon and on the web.Kit lens: great optics, but cheap zoom. People vary widely on the kit lens. Since I bought the body first I had a lot of options for lens. I went with the kit lens because many reviews I went to said the kit lens had great optics but 'felt cheap'. The optics though people said were on par with the older 14-45 kit lens. The optics are very good with this kit lens. And the zoom is not an issue on pictures. However it does take some practice on videos or you will get a very choppy and noisy zoom.Micro 4/3 is now going to be my 'beyond good point and shoot' photo system. I like that lenses can be used on Panasonic and Olympus bodies and the reviews of the lenses. I mentioned Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 45-175mm/F4.0-5.6 Lens for Panasonic Lumix G-Series Digital Cameras. In addition to that you might want to check out highly regarded 20mm lumix lens and a 25mm Panasonic Leica lens. They are pricey. Make no mistake you can easily spend DSLR money on a micro 4/3. But I was able to get the body, kit lens, and 45-175 all for under $600 in February of 2013.One other lens I should mention as a 'prime' lens (prime means fixed focal length) it is the sigma 30mm. Sigma also makes a 19mm. The current versions are highly rated. But in late January they announced updated lenses in what they are calling their 'art' series. They still don't have nearly the f stop the 20mm and 25mm I mentioned above do, but I may hold off getting a prime until those come out.Only a couple of minor gripes. The battery is pretty bad, Usable, yes. But it runs out faster than any battery I have used, DSLR or point and shoot. Also if there are editing features in the camera I haven't found them. A lot of cameras let you at least crop, and some let you change to black and white in the camera itself. For a 2011 camera it should have had those features.Bottom line with the G3 is DSLR quality in a (relatively) small body. Great user friendliness, super responsive focusing, quick shutter action (compares to DSLR NOT high end point and shoot), and a variety of highly ranked lenses.Also VERY GOOD video depending upon the lenses you have. Check out YouTube for some video shot with the Vario 45-175, impressive and I am getting results like that.But for all of that you are spending close to or as much as DSLR money. Was it a good choice for me? Yes. The lighter weight, smaller the cameras are the more use they will get. I just don't want to lug around a lot of camera when out with the family. And the pictures are great. The price now is less than many point and shoot. Your zoom range is less, but oh how much camera itself you get for the money.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact yet powerful", "Author": "Aiden", "ReviewID": "R3IF3YM89USBWM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my agin Canon PowerShot S3.  Though this camera is way more powerful and versatile, it is not much larger.

Video is great, focusing is nice and fast.Touching the screen to focus actually comes in handy a lot, I wasn't sure if it would just be a gimmick.  And it works well.
