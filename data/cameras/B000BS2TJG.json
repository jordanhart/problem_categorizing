Although a major improvement from my previous camera, I soon noticed many faults that the camera possessed.The major problem I experienced from the camera was its flash. I often found myself turning off the flash when I can. The reason was because all pictures turned out dark. I would usually need to come back and lighten the picture on my computer in order to make it look nice. Also, don't even bother trying to take a picture outdoors while/after the sun has set. I will guarantee that the picture won't turn out unless you are right in front of the subject. Even then, it still turned out dark. The only other time I was pleased by the quality was outdoors on a sunny day when flash was not needed.I was also disappointed in the zoom of this camera. It only came with digital zoom, so of course the quality would completely suck if used. Every picture that I have used zoom with either came out grainy, or disfigured in terms of color quality and exposure. Also, the flash wouldn't even reach the far distance that you are trying to capture, which resulted in a dark picture that was useless.Video quality of the camera was 10x's better than my previous. It had 'okay' quality, but I have definitely seen better. Some grain and not that crisp. But again, don't expect to get much of a picture unless you are in a fully lit area. The camera does a terrible job at capturing light. Video also does not record sound, which was something I would have liked to have.The in camera cropping also had negatives. You can't use the feature with pictures that you used the zoom with. I experienced other problems where cropping was not supported, even though I did not use zoom. During the few times I actually was able to use the crop option, it distorted the image, often making it grainy and unappealing.Other problems I experienced was the \"processing\" problem I would have frequently. After taking a picture, the camera would \"process\" for a couple minutes before I could switch it to video mode, or review other pictures.Overall, the camera is good if you are not that big into quality. Maybe a good camera for every once in a while to capture a moment. But if you are planning on continuous use, I recommend getting a much better camera.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "not bad, but not good", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ALP76DG0QCN1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros-cheap-good quality-user friendlyCons-HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE-A pain-Few optionsOverall: Don't get it unless you won't use it a lot", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera for the Novice User", "Author": "Aakash Desai", "ReviewID": "R70JFPDUTV20O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a Christmas present in 2005 and it's been decent for me for the 2-3 years I've had it.pros:- Easy to Use...pretty much point and click with a no-hassle menu- Cheap/Affordablecons:- The flash is just not very intuitive and I've began turning off the flash because it wears thin on me at social gatherings in dark spots.- Horrible Battery Life...I took this camera on a 2 week trip to Italy and had to insert a pair of Double A batteries every other day (I only took 400-500 shots). The problem is the power usage of the digital screen on the back of the camera. Once that's turned off, the battery life extends to 1-2 weeks sometimes under the same usage as my time in Italy.- A little bit too blocky for users that want something slim.Overall, it's an ok starter camera, but for someone that expects to use a camera quite often, I suggest trying something else.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for taking all your snap shots!", "Author": "Cheryl Lavooi", "ReviewID": "R2CG8PA80A5SDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera for my Mother who is in her 70's, it is easy to use and to get the pictures on the computer.

Now she can share her pictures with family and friends with out buying all the extra prints. I recomend this for all Grand parents for email pictures.
