{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LITTLE CAMERA TO GO", "Author": "Pat de", "ReviewID": "R1N599G8UHCNY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This purchase was made to replace another camera.  I chose the Samsung EC-ES80 Digital because this camera is basically an upgraded version of the Samsung I had.  That camera was used to take literally thousands of pictures in the six years I owned it.  Since I don't require a lot of bells and whistles on my cameras, I went with the Samsung EC-ES80.The only disappointment I have with this camera which I also had with my previous one is that pictures taken on a cloudy day or at night - even at dusk - have a tendency to be dark. Other than that, I think this is a great little camera and I hope it serves me as well as its predecessor.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little camera", "Author": "A.

My budget was low... around a hundred dollars. This fit it and I'm happy with the purchase. I would not use this Camera for wedding photos LOL... The Zoom is not very good and it likes to use its flash on everything in automatic mode..... This causes the pictures to be over lit. This Camera is not any better than the camera on many phones so I only use it too take photos for ebay. If your looking for a camera too take on trip spend some more money.... you wont be happy with this ones performance. Again its not bad... very EZ too use but has some complicated menu's that are not user friendly. It works... its cheap... 3 stars", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I wish it mentioned it didn t come with battery!!!

The outdoors shots were sharp and clear. However, the indoors shots, without flash, were just the opposite. They seemed to be out of focus. One of the most desirable features of today's digital cameras is their ability to take pictures in conditions less than ideal and yet still get good results.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lol......", "Author": "K9", "ReviewID": "RUCL0TOLH14BF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Frys has been selling this unit for 29.99 for quite some time now, and whos going to buy this? drop the price dude.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do Not Purchase", "Author": "tstickney28", "ReviewID": "R1QIC2H1HBRG5D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in silver off of Amazon.com and I received an email from the company saying that they weren't going to fulfill my order because the purchase price was too low.

The price dropped as I was looking at this item, so I purchased it.  To receive emails that the purchase was confirmed and the two days later, emails that they had an error and canceled my order.  I think what the price showed is what I paid and they should not be able to cancel my order  I will think twice before I purchase again.  Hope that won't happen to other people.Cleo from Mn", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Easy of Use : Smart Auto\n5X Optical Zoom\nEasy of Use: Internal Charging System", "Name": "Samsung EC-ES80 Digital Camera with 12 MP and 5x Optical Zoom (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ghdA58luL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004U5TKUC"}}
