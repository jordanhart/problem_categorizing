She is 55 years old and I was afraid a digital camera will be too complicated for her. But the Olympus X-940 14 Megapixel Digital Camera was awe sum!Picture quality is good and she can use it effortlessly and it can take HD video(1080P) as well - quite a bang for my buck!", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "nenene", "ReviewID": "R1NLFD5RZZZVUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera has filters and can do all sorts of special effects. It is def worth more than the price. I am VERY satisfied. A good camera for the plain point and shoot.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R3655IKQKJSUYX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-law because she always brought her disposable camera to events.  Her daughter was getting married and I wanted her to be able to get decently good pictures to show to friends and family right away.  Unfortunately, this camera didn't cut it.  It took too long to focus and the pics are poor quality.  I tried to adjust the settings but nothing helped.  It feels very cheap and flimsy in your hand as well.  I know this wasn't an expensive camera but it's still not worth the price.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera until it stops working...", "Author": "Richard S.

It turns on and does what it should, except that it won't take a picture anymore. Went online to look for solution, but found nothing. I wish the new cameras were as long lasting as my old Argus.... I'm going to avoid Olympus in the future.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "NTC Tech Inc made sure I had a speedy delivery of my full refund", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3O4M96PJD2Q3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item I received from this company did not work, sadly.
