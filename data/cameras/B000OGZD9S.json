{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera !", "Author": "PJD \"smart shopper 30144\"", "ReviewID": "R2EO0WJ47P37GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera since it first was introduced. I bought it from Best Buy for around $150.00. I have used it for years without a single problem. I leave it in \"simple\" (idiot) mode most of the time and the pics turn out great. I dumb it down to 3 MP for e mail purposes but any pics that I have had enlarged up to 8 x 10 were perfect. No one can believe this camera is so old yet turns out such great pics. I've used the Macro mode to shoot my flowers, mushrooms, fungus on wood, spider webs.....you name it....Very rarely am I disappointed. I can't think of anything I would change or want on this camera. It's just perfect for the casual photographer but has capabilities far beyond my expertise if needed. I own vintage cameras back to 2.0 MP and new ones up to 14 MP but I am always returning to this Panasonic when I want to be sure the pics are great.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000OGZD9S"}}
