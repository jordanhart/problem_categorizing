{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best price Highest Quality", "Author": "R. Brooks \"Toyota Olympia\"", "ReviewID": "R9G3MNGFRJMY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was cheap when I bought it for $87 off the rack hook at Walmart.  It has 10.2 megapixels and a five power optical zoom.  It has Image Stabilization, Auto Scene Detection, focus and smile detection and can do a rapid zoom.This is a Chinese made camera of course.  Its specifications will match some very name brand cameras you may see since they are built by the same hands using the same parts.  The mystery is why you would pay more unless having a fancy name is why you buy something.  My camera has performed flawlessly and is a great value for the money.  I have used it while vacationing, for family photos and it performs flawlessly.  Came with a 1 gigabyte SD card.  Has cables to do video.I suggest that you get this camera, a cheap 4-5 dollar camera case from Case Logic and a screen protector.  Battery usage is typical, it takes two AA batteries.  Alkaline batteries are fine but you could go up to the lithiums if you wanted to show off.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "Jeffrey Baughman", "ReviewID": "R3UGVHJ194WUMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes stunning pictures and is nice and compact.

One of her friends dropped the old one during a bachelorette party. As she loved this camera I got her another of the same. She highly recommends this camera to anyone who wants a small camera to carry around in your purse.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Since there is NO TECH info", "Author": "Gypsymuse \"Music, Movie, & Book Fiend\"", "ReviewID": "R217GVXQVHH4MA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "got this off the computer geeks merchantsso here's the info on this cameraDONT OWN UT SO I REALLY CANT TELL YOU ANYTHING ON IT Features/Specifications:  * GE WM1050 10.1 MP 5x Optical/5.7x Digital Zoom Camera  * General Features:  * Black color with silver accents  * 10.1 megapixels effective  * 10.4 megapixels image sensor (1/2.33-inch CCD)  * 2.5-inch TFT color LCD (234,000 pixels)  * Electronic Image stabilization  * Exif 2.2 (JPEG) still image files  * Quick Time Motion JPEG, Audio G.711 (monaural) movie files  * WAVE (monaural) audio files (maximum 60 seconds)  * Pan-Capture Panorama  * Auto Scene Detection  * Smile detection  * Blink detection  * Face-detection  * Red-eye removal  * Built-in flash  * 24 MB internal memory  * Supports SD/SDHC memory cards up to 8 GB  * Includes a 1 GB SD card  * USB 2.0 and A/V out  * Powered by two (2) Alkaline batteries or AA NiMH rechargeable battery (two (2) Alkaline batteries included)  * Lens Specifications:  * 6.3 mm (wide) ~ 31.5 mm (tele) focal length  * 35 mm (wide) ~ 175 mm (tele) 35 mm film equivalent  * f/3.0 - f/4.7 aperture  * 7 lens elements in 6 groups  * 5x optical zoom  * 5.7x digital zoom  * Normal focusing range: 60 cm ~ infinity  * Macro focusing range: (wide) 5 cm ~ infinity (tele) 80 cm ~ infinity  * ISO Sensitivity: Auto, 64, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600  * Single AF, Multi-AF (TTL 9-point)  * Shooting Modes:  * Auto  * Manual  * Image Stabilization  * Sport  * Children  * Indoor  * Leaf  * Snow  * Sunset  * Fireworks  * Glass  * Museum  * Landscape  * Night Landscape  * Night Portrait  * Panorama  * Portrait  * Still Image Size:  * 10.1 megapixels  * 9 megapixels (3:2)  * 8 megapixels  * 7 megapixels (16:9)  * 5 megapixels  * 3 megapixels  * 0.3 megapixels  * Dimensions:  * 2.5 x 3.6 x 1.2-inches (H x W x D, approximate)  * 5.1 oz (camera only)  * Regulatory Approvals:  * FCC  * CE  * C-Tick  * WEEE  * Gost-RPackage Includes:  * GE WM1050 10.1 MP 5x Optical/5.7x Digital Zoom Camera  * A/V cable  * USB cable  * Two (2) Alkaline batteries  * Wrist strap  * 1 GB SD card  * User's manual  * Software CDAdditional Information:  * Notes:  * Model: WM1050  * UPC: 8 10027 01292 0  * Product Requirements:  * Available USB outlet", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003BKTD7C"}}
