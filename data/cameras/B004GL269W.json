{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding camera & 'glass'", "Author": "Simon Crosbie", "ReviewID": "R3HK5G1UHGJS5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY D7000 kit arrived at the perfrect time for an adventure tour in Costa Rica and the results are amazing. Total flexibility in my upgrade from a D80 that survived 5 years of tropical conditions, sand, sun, salt, dust and rugged travel. The D7000 was needed to continue the adventure ohotography and with the video option is the complete package. The 18-200 is a magic lens and I rarely need to swap over to the 50mm 1.4.Very, very pleased with yet another great purchase and service delivery from Amazon.Big 'thumbs up' from Croz'", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7000", "Author": "Kgrweiss9", "ReviewID": "R2I5WEPT3Y0I59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade from my Nikon D60.  I do alot of sports photography for my daughters club soccer and this camera provides me with all the features for this type of photography.  The camera is light weight and easy to operate.  Has lots of dials and knobs but it is easy to learn what does what.  If you already have a Nikon DSLR the learning curve is small.  With two SDHC slots you have lots of memory for both stills and video.  If you like to shoot and want more than point and shoot this is a great camera.  Clearly the optics of Nikon are excellent.  I still use my D60 as a second camera on the field.  This is what is great about Nikon, it may be older but it is still good.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,399.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 9 PRODUCTS -- All Brand New Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\nNikon D7000 Digital SLR Camera (Body) PLUS + Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II DX ED AF-S Nikkor-Zoom Lens\nTranscend 16GB High-Capacity SecureDigital (SDHC) Card + Vivitar 72mm UV Glass Filter\nZeikos ZE-BP2-S Deluxe Sling Digital SLR Camera Backpack Case (Black/Silver)\nPrecision Design Memory Card Storage Wallet +Precision Design Deluxe 6 Piece Lens &\nDigital SLR Cleaning Kit + Digital Camera LCD Monitor Screen Protectors\nPrecision Design Deluxe Camera Tripod with Carrying Case", "Name": "Nikon D7000 16.2 MP Digital SLR Camera Body with 18-200mm VR II Lens + 16GB Card + Filter + Backpack Case + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N7YPTH5AL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004GL269W"}}
