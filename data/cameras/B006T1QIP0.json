Doesn't totally sync with Patterson Imaging so someone has to click the mouse while someone holds the camera. There is a learning curve to it. My hygienist is much better at it already than I. The zoom button is worthless. very crisp pix i must say. very light camera. Does not come with a  holder, we had to rig something with velcro strips. owner's manual is worthless. Like I said still playing with it will update if any changes.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "SilverSurfer", "ReviewID": "R25IXGX25SVJI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm getting a lot of dental work done, and my dentist shows me the pictures from his camera, and I wanted to be able to check my progress at home.  A mirror and flashlight just don't cut it.  I got this and plugged it into a USB port on my Windows XP laptop.  XP recognized it as a USB video device and installed it (didn't use the included CD), then I opened \"My Computer\" and double-clicked the camera, and a window opened up with video from the camera.  I stuck it in my mouth, and got nice clear focused images just like my Dentist shows me.  Haven't tried to save a still picture, but I'm 100% happy with the installation and video performance.  There's a bag of plastic sheaths included.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.95", "Features": "Resolution: 2 Megapixel\nLighting: 4 x LEDs\nLens: wideview\nRecords Video/Takes snap shots, 30 fps\nWaterproof", "Name": "Sewell USB IntraOral Oral Dental Camera, 2 MegaPixel, 4 LED", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21OD1ftAkEL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006T1QIP0"}}
