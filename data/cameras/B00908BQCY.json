{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A much better camera than I thought it would be!", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R3RJ4L52R9L91J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the past 2 years I looked at the Canon SX-series cameras, but being a person who can only be happy with a lithium-battery camera, I shied away from these. So I finally went for it after reading the AA battery life is getting better. If you buy some rechargeables, preferably Eneloops, you will be happy enough.PROS:* Takes EXCELLENT CRISP, SHARP photos with TRUE COLORS, and also GREAT MACRO (close-up) shots. (I have taken some grainy photos while playing around with it, but they were my fault due to low light without the flash being up).* Larger than an ultra-compact camera, easy to grip, yet not so large where it's a drag to carry with you - this camera feels comfortable - if you have larger hands or fingers, you won't accidentally push the wrong buttons, plenty of room - I have short, stubby fingers and short nails as I do a lot of typing, those ultra-compact cameras were wrong for me!* Very pleased with battery life; I've taken over 250 shots and a couple of videos with the Eneloops, they're still going strong (the alkaline AA batteries included w/camera did not last long) - for Eneloops - see my link below.* The Image Stabilization turns off automatically when you attach the camera to a tripod, something I always forget to do with other cameras (AUTO mode).* When you have this zoomed out to 16X, the stabilization seems to work better than other cameras I've used (the more you zoom out, the shakier it is); normally on other cameras I'd have to use a tripod.* You can optically zoom during a video, audio does not cut out during the zooming function. Zoom motor is VERY quiet once you press the video/movie button, it becomes almost silent - the way it does this amazes me.* Easy for anyone to use in AUTO; and this also has full P/A/S/M manual controls, so this is a camera you can grow into if you are a novice.* Has a Mode Dial - some cameras, including Canon's cheaper models, are removing the dial on top of the camera and changing to a menu-only format.CONS:* Shutter response time is a little slow, probably due to the AA batteries (I'm using a Class 10 SD card, so it isn't that). Not sure if you would be happy with this camera if you are trying to capture fast moving kids or pets; if you can get them to hold still for a few seconds, it's fine.* Build-quality: It's plastic, but if you are careful with your cameras you should be OK. The battery compartment door seems a little more robust than cheaper Canon models I looked at, it has a spring, unlocks and slides out to the side. Plastic tripod mount (ugh!, why couldn't they use metal?)* This camera can't be put into your pocket, it needs a case.  Also, a camera this size needs a neck strap, not a flimsy little hand strap like the one in the box.* The 230,000 pixel LCD screen doesn't impress me, I've purchased cheaper cameras that have 460,000 pixels. You may be unhappy with photo quality when viewing it on the LCD, and pleasantly surprised after you upload the photo to your PC.RANDOM THOUGHTS:1. My camera was made in JAPAN! Not to say yours will be; I know with Panasonic cameras sometimes the same model will come from different countries. I don't know about Canon.2. I've yet to find a P&S; digital camera that is perfect. This one isn't perfect either, so it got 4 stars. You have to weigh the pros & cons for YOUR specific needs in a camera. I've tried other cheaper, basic Canon's, and I either returned them or re-gifted to friends.3. There are strap openings on both sides of this camera, but they are so small they will only accommodate those small loops like wrist straps have. I think I found a neck strap that will work, see my link below. I've got one on order now.4. I uploaded a short video to YouTube, I am Yarii41 on YT; if you do a search for \"Canon SX160 Video Test\" you should find it. I can't put the link here, since links to other sites aren't allowed in our reviews.ENELOOP BATTERIES: Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh typical / 2400 mAh minimum High Capacity, 4 Pack AA

2013:If you prefer using 2-AA batteries in a digital camera - as I do very much - then you seriously need to consider buying a Canon SX160, now, while the supplies still last. The new model SX170 runs on a Canon NB-6LH proprietary battery which costs $38 on Amazon for each spare battery, and it will only take about half as many shots per charge. The Canon SX160 is now the last remaining 2-AA battery, full-featured, full-function, compact, travel & field camera left on the entire worldwide market.  When the remaining ones are gone, they are gone forever.I have owned and used all of them from the SX100 to the SX160. I have long-considered the Canon SX100 line of cameras to be \"The Best 2-AA-Battery All-Purpose Travel and Field Cameras Ever Made.\" I have posted 5-star reviews of both the SX150 and SX160 here on Amazon during the last two years, and I have made it abundantly clear why I feel so strongly favorable of them.Both cameras - the SX160 and SX170 - have exactly the same features, the same functions, and the same specs - except for the batteries.  Functionally they both work exactly the same, and they both produce identical quality pictures. No changes were made to either the sensor or to the DIGIC 4 image processor to bring any improvement to the final images produced by the SX170.But it's your call.If you like using 2-AA batteries in a full-featured, compact, travel & field digital camera, then you need to act now. As for myself, I just bought two of them. The Canon SX160 is still my number one favorite camera I have ever owned in my life, and I still plan to keep right on using it for many pleasant years yet to come.Sincerely, and with best wishes to everyone, John AKA SLOphoto1&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Tuesday, September 18, 2012  10 AM -- I bought the Canon SX160 IS today. (Early-Sale Source.) I've tested it out at home, and everything works great! Here are some observations and results.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Video Added, Friday, September 21, 2012 at 11 AM.  Flyover of the Space Shuttle, almost over my house in Monterey, CA, shot with the Canon SX160 at 16X zoom using a tripod mount.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Oct. 17, 2012  Finally got my Red Canon SX160 locally from Green's Camera World here in the Del Monte Shopping Center in Monterey.  Beautiful right out of the pristine box.  I love it!&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Oct. 25, 2012  Posted three images I recently took to the users' image gallery here with this camera. They show what this camera can do with the right adjustments in Manual Mode. (I give the exact adjustments for each one.) A Monterey Sunrise, A Blue Jay on a Wire at 16X zoom, and a Balcony View of Monterey Bay. Enjoy!&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&The Canon SX160IS is - in my personal opinion - the best 2-AA battery, all-purpose travel and field camera ever made. It is the latest and the best of a long line of highly dependable point-and-shoot megazoom cameras - the Canon SX100 series - which began five years ago in September 2007. With its combined features, its reliability, its versatility, and it's very economical price there is absolutely nothing else like it available today.It is the only quality digital camera of its type left in the world that still runs on 2-AA batteries. In the world of digital cameras, it stands alone as completely unique. It is the last one its kind, and the very best one manufactured to date. And it's a Canon.A WORD OF CAUTION: This camera is not ideal for everyone. There is no point buying something that you are not going to like. If you don't like AA batteries, then you won't like this camera. Its features probably don't outweigh its faults unless you really want to use AA batteries. It does not have a viewfinder, none of this line of cameras ever has, so if you want a viewfinder then this camera simply will not work for you. Also, for the record, this camera is not a fast-action camera. It is not the best camera for taking pictures of fast-moving children or sports action shots. Photos taken with it at higher ISOs (film speed) are pretty grainy even in good light.  And the flash-recovery time is notoriously - there is no other word for it - slow!  If any of this won't work for you in your own individual situation, then you really need to look elsewhere, seriously, because this camera simply will not meet your needs and will only frustrate you when you try to use it.The SX160 has its own charm, but it's rather old-fashioned in style and a bit slow in operation. It's kind of like owning the latest version of a classic car. It feels like a classic, and after five years and six very successful models it is actually becoming a classic in its own right. If that idea appeals to you, then you will probably like the SX160 very much. For photographing things like landscapes, portraits, architecture, and pretty much anything without a lot of fast motion in it, it functions very well, and it has an excellent zoom. Realistically, you will need a tripod at times if you want to get the best quality shots with it, especially for lower-light shots, long-exposure night shots and for very precise full-telephoto shots.If that still appeals to you, then this review of the SX160 is addressed to you.I have owned and used all six of the cameras in this line over the years - SX100 (2007,) SX110 (2008,) SX120 (2009,) SX130 (2010,) SX150 (2011,) and now the SX160. I have also had an extra two of these cameras converted internally to shoot infrared photographs. Over the years I have used these cameras to photograph everything from brilliant outdoor landscapes to the wispy lights of the Aurora Borealis and out to some 12X images of the four moons of Jupiter (Now you can even do 16X images of them.) These cameras have shown themselves to be very versatile field cameras for me, very dependable, and have always worked out very well for me all the way around. After five years, I am very familiar with them, and I prefer them for general purpose, travel and field photography above all other cameras on the market today.I always carry my current model of this camera with me wherever I go, and if I am on a vacation or field trip, I also carry last year's model with me as a backup camera. They produce an excellent quality image (for a small sensor) and they have all the features I personally want to do a wide range of photography. And in countless situations - particularly while traveling - I have been very, very glad that I had with me a camera that still ran on AA batteries. I always carry at least one or two extra pairs of eneloop rechargeable AAs with me, and the few times when even those ran out on me I was always able to find a pack of standard AA alkaline batteries nearby - anywhere in the world - to keep on shooting.I shoot mostly in Manual mode, but Auto Mode also does an excellent job in selecting the proper settings for you. If I am unsure of the lighting in any one situation, I always make sure to take at least a few shots in Auto Mode myself, just in case.The SX160 is very much like the previous model, the SX150 (which I also reviewed here at 5-stars.)  I'm not going to list all the basic features about the SX160, since they are easy to find in any professional review, or from Canon's own website.  But I will point out in particular what is new with the SX160, and there are some nice new features. So moving right along then...PART 2 -- HERE'S WHAT IS NEW with the Canon SX160IS.16 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE and 16X ZOOM: Last year's model SX150 had a 12X zoom and took a 14 megapixel image. This year's model SX160 has a 16X zoom and takes a 16 megapixel image. Most people will certainly like that better.EXPOSURE LIVE VIEW (This is not new, but it is an important reminder): Canon cameras have something called an \"Exposure Live View\" on the LCD.* Other brands only have \"Live View,\" but that's not the same thing. \"Live view\" simply means you see on the LCD exactly what the camera sees. \"Exposure\" Live View means you see on the LCD what the final photo will look like (how light or dark it will be) before you actually take the shot. The LCD lightens and darkens as you adjust the dial. If you want high definition in the shadows you simply raise the exposure. If you want high definition in clouds, then you lower the exposure. Combine the two images in Photoshop and you get an HDR photo (High Dynamic Range) with well-defined clouds together with bright colors even in the shadows. Canon LCDs make this judgement call (how much exposure?) much easier, because it is more intuitive. You can actually see a simulation of the image on the LCD before you take the actual shot.* Technically called \"exposure simulation live preview\" or \"exposure priority display.\"IT IS MUCH, MUCH EASIER to learn how to use the Advanced Modes on a Canon camera than on any other camera, because you can see the effect of each one of the adjustments - Shutter Speed, Aperture Size and ISO (film speed) - right on the LCD as you make the changes. On other cameras without this Exposure Live View LCD feature, all individual adjustments are done completely blind to the user. You just have to \"know\" from experience how to make the adjustments. And that can be a long, slow, frustrating learning process for many people. With a Canon camera, it's easy.To the best of my knowledge ONLY CANON CAMERAS have \"Exposure Live View\" as a standard feature (The first one on the market was the Canon PowerShot G1, I think Canon has a patent on it.) Nikon, Panasonic and Fujifilm, cameras do not, except maybe for some of their high-end models, where they probably have to pay a license fee to Canon to use it. Think about this \"Exposure live view\" feature on your LCD display VERY carefully. It is one of the biggest differences in deciding between buying a Canon camera, and buying anything else.SUPERFINE JPEG COMPRESSION Option: This outstanding feature was dropped after the SX110, but has now been restored on the new SX160. JPEG compression always results in some loss of data. The 16 megapixel image taken by the SX160 would normally compress down to about a 3.8MB JPEG file image using a \"Fine\" compression, as on previous models. The restored \"Superfine\" option on the SX160 will compress that same camera image down to about a 7MB JPEG file image instead, much larger and retaining much more of the original data in the final image. (These figures are approximate and I have found in practice they can vary considerably with image complexity.) This is an important feature for getting a good quality JPEG file, so please keep it in mind.LESS SHUTTER LAG: Shutter lag has always been a problem with this line of cameras. Canon says the shutter lag has been reduced by 46% on the new SX160, and, yes, it is noticeably faster. This is really appreciated after having lost quite a few good shots over the years to this shutter lag problem myself. I am glad they improved it, but just remember that this has been a long-standing problem with this line of cameras.IMPROVED PROCESSING SPEED. This has also been a traditional problem with this line of cameras, and given the structure of the internal electronics, it is likely to persist. They are slow to process the image and load it onto the memory card. (Use at least a Class 6 card with the SX160.) Canon claims to have improved on this by about 20% and any improvement certainly will help. But fast-processing is simply not this camera's strong point, so just remember that, too.LIVE VIEW CONTROL MODE: Canon has introduced a new and rather interesting type of mode on the main camera dial called \"Live View Control.\" This mode is similar to Auto mode, but has three additional individual adjustments the user can control on variable slider bars using the right and left arrows or turning the control dial on the back of the camera. These control 1) Brightness as Dark --- Light, 2) Color as Neutral --- Vivid, and 3) Tone as Cool --- Warm. They are easy to use, and adjust in a series of distinct steps as you rotate the control dial. This is an excellent feature for the novice who wants to try some different adjustments without having to go to full Manual mode, and it makes these image adjustments right in the camera which would normally require a Photoshop-type program to adjust afterwards. Again this will be easy for the novice to use, because the Canon LCD display on the SX160 shows an image of the actual exposure adjustments being made before the shot is finally taken.DESIGNATED VIDEO BUTTON was moved: The model SX150 introduced a designated video button, but placed it so close to the spin control dial on the back that is was pretty easy to start a movie by accident. The button has now been moved further away, and has also been recessed with a small, raised, plastic lip around it making it much less accident prone. This was a very good idea.NO ISO LIMIT on the camera: Some of the lower-end Canon cameras have recently been subject to an unfortunate ISO 100 (film speed) limitation when shutter speeds drop below about 1 second in length, even in full Manual Mode. This can be a severe hinderance to doing things like long-exposure nighttime photography. Fortunately, Canon did not put that loathsome ISO limit on the new SX160. ....*** THANK YOU, CANON! ***Also, many of the professional reviews, and even some conflicting data on Canon's own website indicated that the ISO 1600 (very fast film speed for shooting things like fast-moving cars and also for doing long-exposure star shots) had been eliminated. This is false.  The ISO 1600 is still there on the SX160, and though it is pretty grainy it does still work well when needed, and most of the excess noise can be cleared up in Photoshop. On the lower end, the ISO 80 was eliminated on the SX160, but is was close enough to the ISO 100 that it should not matter too much except maybe in photos taken in very bright sunlight.In closing, I hope that this review may have been helpful to you in gathering information to make your own decisions about which camera to buy for yourself. You should read as much as you can before you decide which one to buy. Whatever decision you make, it should be YOUR decision, not what I or anyone else tells you that you \"ought\" to prefer. Each of us has our own reasons for preferring one camera over another. May you choose the camera that best suits your own individual needs and preferences, and may you enjoy it to the fullest extent.Best Wishes, John AKA SLOphoto1", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "An inexpensive camera with a powerful zoom with great manual control", "Author": "dlc \"dlc\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q5OHJ9409J6T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I primarily purchased the SX160 to take videos and photos of my kids performing in an orchestra. For my purpose the camera worked very well, sitting in the back row I had a clear view of the entire stage and was easily able to zoom up to my children's faces as they were playing their instruments.While taking videos the zoom is very silent and smooth and from 16x it will magnify digitally up to 64x which was surprisingly sharp and clear as the image stabilization was very effective. Considering the theater type stage lighting the exposures looked great although the auto focus did have trouble at one point but was reliable most of the time. The camera also picks up the sound in stereo so the music from the performances sounded amazingly good.My results with still photos were also very good considering the extended zoom and low lighting conditions, I also appreciated the silent mode which muted all sounds from the camera. I own a Canon Rebel XS and am so conditioned to this electronic age of cameras that I was trying to figure out how to mute it also until it dawned on me that it is an SLR with an actual mirror and shutter making the noise.Since this camera uses AA batteries I am never in short supply of power with many spare Ni-MH batteries at my disposal. The downside is that the SX160 only uses two batteries resulting in agonizingly slow recharge times for the manually activated flash. The upside is that this camera takes decently good photos in low-light without the flash if set up properly.I'm familiar with the old 35mm manual SLR cameras of the past so I appreciate the ability to control shutter speed, aperture, and ISO settings with this camera. There are also several unique shooting modes such as toy camera, miniature, and fish eye. My kids have a fun time with the fish eye setting and take some hilarious photos in that mode.For the price this is a great camera for the powerful stabilized zoom and video capture with stereo recording. Having manual controls one can take terrific natural light photos with the SX160.Although as a point and shoot camera some may be disappointed since the flash does not pop-up automatically when needed which may often result in blurred photos along with the frustratingly long recharge times. Without flash the SX160 starts up fast, is very responsive, focuses quickly with decent shot to shot times capturing well exposed images.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great For trips.", "Author": "MS1700", "ReviewID": "R3Q8C0A5IXA29T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At one time I was a Professional Photographer.  The kind of equipment I used to use would be risky to take on trips and lots of mombo Jumbo to go with them.  Filters, lighting, flashes, lenses you get the idea.  I bought a Canon powershot of the smaller variety but it was ahrd to control some scenes like I wanted to.  In comes the SX 160 IS  It has Full Auto so you don't miss the shot and complete control in Aperature or Time Values, And a great number of other control features that would be found on much higher end camera's.  you need this on a Vacation especially when your on a Motorcycle and this is what I bought this gem for.  The video is fantastic.  The zoom is all there and even if I eventually decide to go bust on a higher end camera, this one will be in my arsenal!It uses AA battery's and a lot of people do not like the time they get out of them.  This all depends on useage and settings.  BUT This is an advantage.  You can ALWAYS find AA battery's and they can easily be carried.  Personally I have 2500 Milliamp (Larger capacity) rechargeable that recharge buy 120V or 12V  Perfect for my Motorcycle rides.  I always have 4 on hand.  The high cap. Lithium Ion battery's are nice, but once you are out, your out until you recharge.  I can ALWAYS find a AA.There is also a printer for this camera,  you can print as soon as you take them.This is the camera with the control I was looking for.  it can produce some fantastic 16 X 20 photos with almost no noise, and quite frankly who ever even does that?It uses and SD and it makes use of the fast ones, so load up a large fast SD card and turn out some very good 720 HD video.  And the Mic has a wind filter!  Good thinking Canon!Why risk a better camera for point and shoot photoraphy when you can have this one on hand? For this price you will only cry because you lost your great camera, not that you paid a million dollars for it!I love this semi compact fully flexable shooting mode highly zoomable Macro closeness camera.Some people report slow flash charge up time.  This depends on your battery's quit being so cheap, buy good battery's.  Some people report that it powers on too easily.  buy a case. You could damage the lens if it powers on at a bad time accidently.  The battey's come out quick if you need to disarm its power.Nikon sells a similar Camera, if you try both, you will see that even two people totally unfimiliar with the Camera's can both navigate the canon more quickly and easily.

However, I do own the camera and thought I'd write a short review.. I bought this camera to replace a Nikon Coolpix L11, which died after many years of use. I have a Nikon D40, but I like to have a small camera I can carry with me in my purse or backpack to capture kids, pets, just whatever. I did some research comparing prices, specs, etc. and took a chance on this camera. At first I was a little skeptical, but I find the more I use it the better I like it. (I should really say, the more I LEARN about it, the better I like it!) It is great in the \"stand here and let me take your picture\" situations. I have also used it some on my kids sporting events. It is not on the level of the D40 for catching the action, but it does fine for a point and shoot. I have been impressed with the quality of the pictures. I've tried out the \"super zoom\" on pets and nature shots, I think I need a little more work on that!  I am interested to see how the battery life is. So far I am happy it uses AA's. I don't know how many times we have been at a theme park or sporting event and I find my batteries are dead. AA's are easy to find, not so easy with a rechargeable battery like the D40 has. The flash is taking some getting used to. You have to press a separate button under the flash to turn it on and wait for it to charge. It's a matter of seconds to charge, but if you have fidgety kids it might as well be 5 minutes, especially if you are trying to take more than one picture. Since I use a small camera a lot in outdoor settings, this is not really a deal-breaker for me. I am still learning about the auto-focus, modes, zoom, etc. As I learn I will be happy to come back and update my review.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good combination of features for a backpacker's camera; hard to find such features together these days", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RINVEJR9UD8SS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EDIT: I originally gave a 5 star rating, and demoted to 4 stars after field testing because of its lack of panorama feature. However, I have discovered that there is a panorama function in the included software disc so you can stitch on your computer later. That's better than nothing, but my previous comparable cameras had internal panorama stitching with a guide so you line up the images yourself in the process of taking them or even sweep the camera for auto stitch. I have installed the software for this camera but not used it yet. But how can you be sure you have the proper overlap matching when taking the photos separately? What about when you get back home & realize they don't match up well? You'd be able to retake the shot with an internal stitching camera but with this one, you're just out of luck with a bad photo. The fact that it is not very obvious that the panorama stitching capability even exists and that it is not in a user friendly format keeps the rating at 4 stars instead of 5, although I'm hopeful that I'll gain a knack for it over time. Overall I am still quite pleased with this cameras features for my backpacking, camping, & hiking purposes.My previous review:Certainly not the most amazing camera available, but here is what I like about it. It is the best compromise I could find on the many features that are important to me as a backpacker, and I did a lot of looking to find it. There are not many cameras made with this combination anymore so this one gets 4 stars from me (would get 5 if it could do panorama like most of its competitors).1) I do extended wilderness backcountry camping and I like to take many photos meaning batteries run out. Without electricity outlets in the wilderness, those rechargeable battery packs that most cameras are powered by nowadays are useless once it dies so I must have a camera powered by easily replaceable AA batteries I can carry spares of. A bunch of rechargeable AA sets is best so I can recharge them for my next adventure after I get home and save money on replacements, but I still carry some regular AAs along with them as a backup. There are many small cameras powered by rechargeable battery packs that will do what I want, but long-term backpacking photography makes AA power a deal breaker for me.2) Many times I want a good zoom shot. Most AA cameras nowadays that have a decent zoom require 4 AAs! I tried this out with the Kodak Z990 which has 30X optical zoom. The photos were good (in fact, my last 2 cameras were Kodak Easy Shares requiring 2 AAs and I was happy with them), but a camera that takes 4 AAs is just to bulky to practically pack around so I gave that away as a nice gift. A 2 AA camera like this is designed with a much slimmer profile. This is compact enough that I can keep it in a small camera bag and still fit that bag in my large pocket for extra protection from getting knocked around or to keep it warmer in freezing temperatures or extra safe from rain. Not to mention that the weight of spare batteries you need to carry for a 4 AA camera is twice as much as a 2 AA camera like this which still has a great 16X optical zoom (much more than most 2 AA cameras you'll see today), and a further digital zoom if desired.3) Sometimes you happen upon wildlife action and/or a scenic area where a short video is nice to get and this is capable of video with audio.I can't comment on long term durability yet. I'm taking it out on a trip in a few weeks & will update on how it holds up in the field. Seems solid enough if treated with reasonable care. It has a lot of extra features that an amateur like me probably doesn't know how to use or really need, but that's nice for people who would use them. I use the automatic setting and my test photos seem to turn out nice. I can't wait to take it out in the backcountry & see what it does out there. Obviously I would have liked to pay even less (who isn't cheap at heart?) but at $150 on sale this will be a good investment as long as it lasts a long time.As a con, I've noticed it doesn't seem to save pictures without a memory card. I do bring ample memory card storage with, but it seems like every other camera I've had did have at least a little internal memory aside from the insertable card memory. Not a big deal because I use the cards anyway, but be aware you'll need to get one if you don't already have it. And as others have noted, the right hand grip is a little tricky until you get used to it because you don't get the large gripping bump like more bulky models have. Again, not a big deal to me personally and I got used to 1 handed operation after a little practice but maybe if you have arthritis or something it could be difficult to manage single handed. But no problem with both hands.All in all I was happy to find the combination of features this camera offers. Seems like no other cameras are made this way anymore which sucks for backpackers. One thing is I wish it were waterproof/submersible to a shallow depth as some cameras are, but I can live without that because of all the great things it does have going for it. It's water resistant enough for photos in light rain/misty conditions, just keep it in a protective bag/pocket when not actually taking the photos so it doesn't get soaked. Like I said, use reasonable care and it seems durable enough (construction-wise) to stand up to backpacking use.EDIT: After my trial photos on a backpacking excursion I was very pleased with the image quality.  Not as user-friendly as the Kodak Easy Shares I'm used to, but not too difficult and I'll get used to it with use (I saved the online manual pdf and it is thorough enough if you want to reference it for anything more technical). Overall I like my new camera and it held up well. Freezing temperatures did not prevent it from working properly (I did try to keep it warm in my pocket though and I would be careful about bringing it into conditions that are too extreme). Battery life was acceptable, not exceptional, if you keep the flash down, but using the flash often drains batteries faster and makes you wait longer between pictures to recharge the flash. One big thing I found wanting was a panoramic feature to stitch photos together into one big picture. Seems like most cameras have that feature these days and I thought this one did too. I must have confused it with another model I was comparing while shopping (my fault). It's odd that a really useful feature like panorama is not available but Canon did go to the trouble to add many silly options like fish-eye effect etc. I was in a thickly wooded area on this trip so lack of panorama wasn't a very big deal, but a couple of years ago I did a camping road trip out west and have some great panorama shots of the wide open spaces and mountain top vistas. They could be shot as either 2 or 3 photo lengths long stitched together as you desired. I would not be able to get those spectacular views all into one shot with this Canon SX160 and that is really a bummer. However, while testing it out, I did discover that you can go into the camera menu and change the \"aspect ratio\" from the default 4:3 to 16:9 when desired and this expands the photo view to a somewhat wider field of vision. Not as wide a view as 3 photos together but better than nothing.  Still, with all the backpacker friendly features that the SX160 has in combination I will compromise on the lack of panorama capability.

Got it for Christmas 2012. So far everything i wanted plus a little more.Pros:1.  Nice size which helps with holding it steady at super zoom distances. But can still carry it in my pocket.2.  Very nice 16 mp shots. The bigger the better.3.  Super zoom to get close up shots from far away. (This replaced a 3x zoom camera).4.  Lots and lots of manual adjustments. Anywhere from full manual to full automatic and everything in between.5.  AA batteries for easy replacement on the go.6.  Cool flash pop up.7.  Price for what you get.Negatives: I was aware of these prior to purchase, thus why no stars off.1.  Drains batteries fairly quickly.2.  Somewhat slow between flash shots, can be up to 7 sec while flash recharges.3.  Low def display screen.This is by far the best digital camera I've owned. I love the larger size. It actually makes you look like a semi-pro photographer ;). DSLR is too big for me at this time. I didn't want to carry around a camera bag and be constantly worried about a $900 investment. This camera is not an investment at $150, it cost less than most smartphones, but the image quality and ability far exceeds any phone camera.  I can take it out of it's small bag and just carry it in my pocket, which is soooo nice and convenient. Easy to quickly put away while needing both hands for something else.Portraits and family shots are why I got it. It excels at those. Motion shots can get blurry, but half of a quality motion shot has to do with the photographer.  That being said, I've taken very nice motion shots. If the motion is predictable and the lighting is good you can get decent shots. I actually had an easier time getting quality motion shots when the motion was side to side relative to me. Motion towards or away from me meant I needed a quick trigger to get a good shot. The auto focus could not keep up with objects changing depth.  One way around this is to pre focus at the desired depth, wait for the object to get back to the predicted position then shoot. This worked for a kid on a swing and is one example of what I meant by predictable motion.  It does take patience, several shots and 'living through' the camera; what I mean by that, is spending a lot of time viewing the action through the camera display instead of in the real world.  But there are good shots to be had, it just takes a little work. Don't let all the negative reviews convince you that the world has to stop while you set up the shot.Picture quality is excellent. Although some of the auto setting do need manual tweaking. For instance with a bright background some photos tend to be be washed out. Auto white balance is not compensating enough. Auto focus sometimes focuses on the wrong object at the incorrect depth.  But being digital you can take as many shots as you want and ditch the bad ones.  The burst shots are a little slow. More like a shot every one-half to full second. I'm very happy with its appearance, performance, manual options and picture quality and for $150 it's really not reasonable to expect $900 performance.  Even with its limitations due to being a budget camera, it is the best one I've ever owned.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera.

I really don't understand the 1-star reviews that say their pictures weren't clear. (It is possible that they got a lemon), as I've only taken a few blurry photos, and those were all operator error. In fact, I've gotten clear photos when testing out the shutter speed and trying to see if I could make it blurry. (more on that later)You can just set the camera to 'Auto', point and shoot,and get great pictures. However, if you want to get even more out of it, there is a bit of a learning curve, but I've learned quickly. (There's still more to learn).There are more presets on this than the average point and shoot. I've particularly had fun with the 'Miniature Effect' preset. The 'Super Vivid' preset make the colors...well...super vivid! Pictures taken in the dull of winter look rather vibrant with this setting. I kind of wish I had gotten it in the fall so I could have taken picture of the foliage with this setting (however, this was a Christmas gift).The zoom and focus on this is amazing, especially by point and shoot standards. Even though it's only 16X optical zoom, I was able to get a clear shot of a commercial jet flying overhead. While I don't think it was at full cruising altitude, it was definitely up there. Adjusting the shutter speed also helped  what would have otherwise been a blurry picture. (Trying to track something that's moving about 400 mph while you're zoomed in on it isn't the easiest of task) The auto focus while in macro mode is also one of the best I've used, though sometimes it can be overaggressive or not bring your intended subject into focus. But patience and working with it can yield some terrific results.That's right, this is a point and shoot, but you can adjust the shutter speed and aperture! One setting gives priority to shutter speed (camera auto-selects aperture), another to aperture (camera auto selects shutter speed), and another setting let's you adjust both manually. The shutter can be left open for a full 15 seconds, or snap as quickly as 1/2000 (it will let you adjust up to 1/3200, but according to the manual, it just reverts to 1/2000 anyway). You can also adjust the focus manually if you wish.I got some great night shots leaving the shutter open (with only the glow of a city in the distance as the only light source). As for the faster shutter speeds, I snapped a pic of the blades of my remote control helicopter spinning at full speed, and you can read the lettering on the blades. Getting that shot took some trial and error. I only have two minor complaints. One is the HD video, while clear isn't as good as a standalone camcorder. Even in a quiet room with no background noise, the resulting video sounds like it was shot in the wind. That may be enough for some people to knock off a star, but I wanted a camera primarily to take still photos with. The 720p video is just a bonus to me. (Though I could see using it for video work where I don't need the original audio.Complaint number two is, this thing DEVOURS batteries (which I realize isn't uncommon for electronic devices). It will eat up a pair of Duracells in a day. I can't comment on how long lithium batteries will last, but in the last camera that I had, they lasted about 7 months, so time will tell if I stick with lithium batteries or go with rechargeables.All in all, I can't imagine a better, more versatile point-and-shoot for the price.

Canon doesn't make any cameras that give you poorly defined or uncolorful images.  The quality is better than what you can get from a smartphone camera, and the camera provides more flexibility because of the long telephoto lens (from 16X to 20X power).  It's also a good movie camera (be sure to get a spacious SD card); also, hold the camera still and avoid those irritating short sequences of just several seconds.The SX100 series represents a compromise in size and weight between a Canon Elph (I own the extremely tiny SD780 with viewfinder and the Elph 300) and a full-size camera like a Canon EOS or Rebel.  In fact, the SX100 series is \"compact\" in size, fitting into larger pockets with little problem yet harder to lose than the \"subcompactd\" Canon Elph.The Canon SX160 was rated slightly higher than this year's SX170 by Consumer Reports, perhaps because of slightly better stabiilizing for movies. But from the consumer's perspective, the main reason to select the SX160 is that it takes standard AA alkaline batteries rather than Canon's proprietary batteries, as does the SX170, which undeniably offers a slightly more powerful telephoto lens.I'll admit that keeping Canon chargers and batteries always ready can occasionally be a problem (moreover, my wife's camera takes different Canon batteries from mine).  Moreover, carrying AA batteries in a camera bag while traveling overseas is one effective way to avoid the problem of different voltages for charging.  Hence, the SX160 is the camera I'm gifting to a family member who lost the more expensive camera I gave him last year.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Replaced my Canon Powershot A540", "Author": "R.

I paid $100 for this camera at a local Wal-Mart.  Around this time two years ago, I purchased a Canon Powershot Elph 100HS for the exact same price.  My Elph is a 12MP camera that records 1080P at 24 FPS.  The video quality from this camera is pretty close, probably because this camera records at 25 FPS.I have played around with this camera quite a lot for the last 2 hours and I'm 99.99% sure it won't be leaving my possession.  Even though I assumed this would be like any P&S; (Point & Shoot) camera, this camera has more features on it than a P&S; camera would have.FlashThe flash is a little pop-up on the top, press the flash button above the screen and the flash will turn on when taking pictures.  Press it down to turn it off, simple enough.  You can also control how strong or weak the flash is, depending on your lighting situation.SettingsThis camera has a wide array of settings, including Program, Auto, Scene, etc.The one feature I loved most, which is something you don't see in many (if any) cameras at this price range, is a manual control for aperture settings, like what you'd see on a DSLR.LensThe lens is capable of 16x optical zoom, which works well to my surprise.  Taking pictures of items at 16x away comes out very clear.  Even though this camera has an image stabilizer, make sure you still hold your hands straight to get a steady picture.VideosThere are 2 video settings on this camera, HD (1280x720) @ 25FPS and VGA (640x480) @ 30FPS.HD comes out pretty sharp while VGA is pretty smooth.  Both settings allow you to zoom optically while recording a video, which is something I wasn't able to do on my Elph 100HS.  Sometimes the video will be blurry after zooming in on something and takes it a while to focus, but for the most part works fairly quickly (yes, this does do autofocus while recording a video).Memory CardMake sure you have an SD card, as Canon doesn't include one and doesn't provide any internal memory.  You will also want a good size memory card, as the pictures were bigger than I thought.  Pictures can take anywhere between 5 and 9 megabytes per picture.  I use a 16gb class 10 Sandisk card and I can record about 97 minutes of 720P or about 2200 super fine pictures.PowerUses 2 AA batteries to work.

I looked at different camera's in this price range and this camera stood out as superior (IMHO). It is an excellent buy for this price range.  You have Canon's quality optics, a 28mm-448mm (35mm equivalent) lens, 720p high definition video, optical image stabilization, manual controls (if you want to override the camera's automated shutter speed, aperture, etc.), exposure compensation and a slew of other great features.Go to Canon's website to look at the owner's manual for a list of all of the features; you will be impressed. [...]The newer version, SX170, was released 2 months ago, it is very similar except it has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, a slightly faster frame rate at 720p (30 vs 25 frames), is slightly restyled and there's a minor change in the layout of the function keys and a few other small differences.For the price difference, the SX160, IMHO, is a much better buy.  A rechargeable battery in the SX170 is nice, but you will definitely want to buy a spare battery so you don't run out of power during your day out taking photographs.  The SX160 uses 2 standard AA batteries and can take Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. What's nice about the AA batteries are if your batteries run low, you can easily find AA batteries at home or at nearby stores.The f3.5- f5.9 aperture may not be the brightest for low light conditions, but there is a pop-up flash you can use. This is not Canon's \"L-Glass -professional DSLR lenses) but the optics, which is comprised of 9 groups / 11 elements with an Aspherical lens & ultra low dispersion glass -pardon my nerdiness, are excellent in this price range.The automatic white balance and focusing is very accurate, the pictures look great and the video quality is very good.  The PC software they provide is easy to use and have many common photo adjustment features without having to buy software to do that.Now about the vendor I bought this from on Amazon, \"Electronics Basket\".

Missing was all of the camera software.  I contacted Canon regarding this and hope they deal with this vendor accordingly.

I have used Canon products for years - still have my old AE-1 - so this was an easy choice; especially given it uses 2 AA batteries of any brand. This is much more handy than having to stick with the manufacturer's overpriced proprietary rechargeable models. If you run low on power you can get AA at most anywhere though I suggest picking up an 8 pack of Eneloop rechargeable ones while ordering on Amazon.com.16M is is a lot of detail. I had to get use to that and never realized how little detail the lower resolution CCDs pick up. The camera uses Canon's Digic software versus a CMOS sensor and since I don't know the difference I can't judge one way or the other as to which is better. The controls are laid out nicely but I still get confused with the myriad of effects I will never use. If you are into the manual aspect of photography some of it may suit you. I like the macro, fisheye and video modes and use them. The zoom is great as are other manual controls.One thing i don't like about the camera is lag time between shots, especially when using flash. The flash is a manual popup deal, which I appreciate because you know when it is going to be on rather than hoping the camera software is smart enough. The flash takes a long time to charge but unless you need to snap off 20 shots in 5 minutes it is no big deal. If you need that kind of performance you need to spend more than $140 and get a camera with a bulky power supply. This is point and shoot fun for anyone regardless of age. if you see it in the LCD screen you can take a picture of it. There is no view finder and I still put it up to my face as if there is at times. I will add that the flash can be rather hot and will wash out some shots...especially when indoors or outdoors at night. The CCD sensor is pretty sensitive so you can get away with shooting in indirect lighting most times.This camera has image stabilization so those of us who aren't the steadiest in the world can still take great photos. There is a video dedicated button so you can shoot a video without wading through a menu of items while missing your shot. Very handy.Some things I suggest when ordering this camera...16G SD card, 8-pack of Eneloop rechargeable batteries and a glass LCD screen protector, all available here on Amazon. A small carrying case is good as well. Since all things are now made of plastic...get the extended warranty program as well, ya never if you might drop, spill a drink on, run over or abuse your camera...it might go dead on its own. The warranty covers it all.

After reading the manual, we immediately took it on a trip to the west coast. We shot over 400 pictures using several different cameras while on the trip: the Canon SX160, a phone camera, and lesser model Canon. When we returned home and loaded the pictures on the PC, I was amazed to see how poorly the Canon SX160IS compared to the same pictures from other cameras. As an example, with pictures of the desert (i can send provide examples) the SX160 had a faded look to it and the clarity was just 'ok'...while the other pictures were vibrant and clear. With indoor pictures using a flash, they were very grainy even using the low light features...unacceptable. It would have gone unnoticed had we not had other pictures to compare to...taken at the same time at the same place. Because of my extreme disappointment, I decided to return the camera to Best Buy and get something else. I explained to them the camera did not take good pictures and I'd like refund. Since it was purchased on June 12, and I requested a refund on July 2 after I returned from vacation, I was told it was purchased 20 days ago which is beyond the 15-day policy. I proceeded to explain the camera wasn't functioning properly and I was very disappointed with the picture quality. The sales person took the camera, snapped a few pictures in the store and said \"it is working fine\". After escalating to the Store General manager, James Pascoe - store #587, and arguing with him for 10 minutes I was told \"We just can't accept returns from people who don't want their cameras anymore\". My options were to keep the camera or \"have it serviced and Best Buy will 100% determine whether it takes good pictures\" and that was it. I like to spread my business around and purchase locally as well as via the internet. Needless to say Bust Buy just made a very easy decision for me as I will NEVER purchase from them again after receiving this type of poor, unprofessional customer service - and not standing behind what they sell.

It does have many more \"user defined features and options\" than the Nikon L 610, both of which I own, but it fails in comparison to the Nikon in a number of very important areas. (You'll also see that the price for the SX160 is dropping weekly and is now below the Nikon L 610 as more buyers realize the shortcomings of this camera.)The 3\" display is inferior. It has a measly 230,000 pixels, while all the other cameras in it's class- such as the Nikon L 610 have a razor sharp 460,000 dot display. Canon needs to fix this pronto. Your pictures will look much better than they show up on this Canon's muddy display. If you want a crisp display, buy the Nikon L 610.The Canon's CMOS, while the same size as the Nikon's- 1\"x2.3\" is not as sensitive for sharp pics in lower light without flash. At ISOs at or above 400, (e.g. taking pictures of the baby while she's asleep) the Canon's pictures are dim and dark compared to the Nikon L 610.The lag time between shots is noticeably longer with the Canon versus the Nikon using the same- and best available- SanDisk, class 10, 45MB/s, 16gig card - probably because the Nikon has a user defined menu/circuitry option to allow you to define the type of AA you're using-alkaline, rechargeable or lithium and take advantage of the lithiums superior capacity.This is a AA camera- which is it's charm.  Forget all the review \"noise\" about alkaline AAs or AA rechargeable batteries, which will be an ongoing misery.  Just get a big pack of Energizer Lithium Extreme 9X AA's from Amazon. A pair will last well over 200 shots with flash.The SX 160 has two strap attachment points on the camera, but sadly, Canon and also Nikon with their L 610, only ship a one point wrist strap. If you still want to buy this camera, or the Nikon, solve this this by ordering the Nikon AN-CP23 strap from Amazon. Minimal mass, tiny logos, tucks neatly in your bag and, most of all, lets you hang the camera around your neck!The very best case for the Canon SX 160 or the Nikon L 610, is the Tamrac 5292.

The video quality is amazing and the pictures look professional. It's great for zooming in on birds outside my window. I was really happy when I realized there is a macro lens feature, meaning you can take close up pictures of things and get them really detailed (example: pollen on a flower).Yes, this camera takes two AA batteries. That can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what kind of pictures you want.Cameras that use batteries are good because:1. You can use rechargeable batteries so you don't have to keep buying new batteries. You just buy some rechargeable batteries and put them into the charger when you're done using the camera at night (on whenever).2. If you're going on a hike or birding or anything like that that's outside for a long time, you can just bring a few re-chargeable batteries in your pocket and change the batteries once or twice so you can use the camera all day. This is much better than cameras that have to be charged because with a rechargeable camera, it wouldn't last you the whole day and you wouldn't have an outlet nearby to charge it with.So this camera is great with the whole rechargeable batteries thing.However, if you really don't want to deal with batteries, you can go for the Canon SX170. It's the exact same features, but instead of taking batteries, you plug it into the wall to charge it. Again, though, I recommend this camera a lot more.The only thing that made me give it four stars was that the focus is sometimes a little messed up. It won't focus on the object right sometimes so it will either come out blurry or the focus will be on something else in the picture rather than the target. However, this only happens sometimes, usually when I'm zooming in on really far away things, so the camera will focus on bushes or trees around the subject instead or the constant movement of the camera will make it blurry.To fix this, you can usually depress the \"shoot\" button halfway and the camera will focus on the subject. This works beautifully 95% of the time.The last complaint I have is that it doesn't capture moving objects well. They'll always come out a little blurry. However, for a camera of this price, it has amazing quality. It's a point and shoot camera, after all; if you want to take perfectly clear pictures of moving objects, invest in a $300 camera or more.The blurriness of quickly moving objects never bothered me because I don't take many pictures like that, but if you want to capture running children or cars or hyperactive pets, you may want to invest in a better camera. However, be warned that it would be much more expensive.The video records beautifully in 720pHD and the sound is clear.The camera comes with the camera itself, two AA batteries so you can use it right away, a data chord (NOT TO RECORD; it's to plug it into a computer to upload pictures), a wrist strap (I recommend you buy a neck strap separately; I'll attach a link below), a solution disk (whatever that is), a one-year warranty, and an instruction manual.Overall, it is an excellent camera for the price. I'm very happy with it.For a good neck strap: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018MR5HK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1If you want the same camera but rechargeable rather than taking batteries: http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX170-Digital-Black/dp/B00EFILR6E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1399745357&sr;=8-1&keywords;=canon+170sx(Same features, just different power supply.)For rechargeable batteries with a charger: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DNPT1CM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1(Click the product box titled \"4 Pack AA with Charger\".", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "If U Find it Buy it!", "Author": "L.

Not Regretted for Even a Minute!", "Author": "Ace-of-Stars", "ReviewID": "R17COEYAAW6TSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just before \"taking a big chance\" with this purchase, I was *LITERALLY* less than 30 seconds away from clicking the \"Place Your Order\" button for the Fujifilm \"FinePix S6800.\"The reason why? Because even though I'd always avoided \"Canon\" products in the past, I'd wanted something more versitile than the Nikon \"Coolpix L18\" (which I'll never recommend due to several common and legitimate complaints about both the company and their products) which I was replacing, but I was also hoping to find something that fell somewhat close within a similar price range... and the Canon \"PowerShot SX160IS\" seemed to offer something fairly close enough within those parameters to at least pique my interest.So old prejudices aside, I'd decided to look very closely at the SX160 -- design, features, legacy, etc., and everything seemed more or less appealing on the surface.So why was I being so apprehensive? Because everywhere I looked to get more information about the camera and how it performs, there were always a significant number of people who would either \"downplay\" it and its abilities or outright trash-talk it. And since \"positive ratings\" in the form of \"owner feedback\" and \"reviews\" are extremely important to me, especially where it concerns items of interest where I've little or no foreknowledge, I took these less-than-stellar opinions as my cue to look elsewhere, and this search led me to the Fujifilm \"FinePix S6800,\" which had OVERWHELMING positive feedback and reviews with almost nothing that was anything less than glowing praisebeing expressed about the unit. So despite the fact that I thought the camera was uglier than a meth addicts teeth and that it would cost me an additional $50 more than the Canon, I took that new knowledge and had just positioned my cursor over the order confirmation button... then I hesitated.Why? Because I had not really put examining the Fujifilm S6800 through quite the same rigid scrutiny as I'd done with the SX160, because all of the praises that were being heaped upon the Fuji were enough for me to lower my guard and momentarily disrupt my objectivity. So I had to go back and look closer at the S6800 the same way as I had with the SX160 -- by looking at examples of what it actually does!So I returned to the video hosting sites where ordinary people had posted examples of things they'd done with their respective cameras, and as for photo quality there was little if any discernable difference between the SX160 and the S6800; where \"video\" had been shot however, examples of the Fuji did occasionally appear \"unstable,\" although that could've just as well been due to hardware/software compatibility issues with the camera and/or the computer. But there was *ONE* thing in particular that I'd overlooked which I definitely felt needed to be assessed, and that was that I had never replayed an uploaded video where a test of the \"telephoto lens\" on the S6800 was being showcased! The \"quiet\" motor (though not entirely of course) of the SX160 was impressive enough for me to sit up and take real notice... but as soon as I played back uploaded media of users engaging the zoom lens feature on the Fuji and heard that horribly loud & nerve-grating grinding engine noise, and in other instances the camera microphone's pee-poor ability to even remotely buffer the sound of the wind blowing into it, *THAT* was the game-changer for me!Since I've had the SX160 (which I chose over the SX170 because I want the flexibility of \"AA batteries\" rather than some \"proprietary\" leg trap), I have nothing but wonderful things to say about it. No, it doesn't take the absolute crispest photographs in the world (can't reasonably expect \"$500+ results\" at \"$200- prices\"), but it perfoms lightyears beyond what I could get from my Nikon Coolpix! Videos shot are sharp and smooth (though as of yet I've not tested this in a \"speed tracking\" setting), and the telephoto is awesome for taking photographs (I've recently taken some amazing shots of the moon both in daylight and nighttime sessions) and is again reasonably quiet for video shoots!As for the most common complaints I keep coming across... yes, it does a sucky job at shooting \"snow scenery\" -- the first time I'd tried it, all I got was nothing but a blank white canvas -- but there's a very simple solution to this problem: Take the setting off of \"AUTO\" and switch it over to \"MANUAL\" and adjust your appertures and ISO speeds! If this sounds like a foreign language, READ THE MANUAL and/or get together with someone who can instruct you in at least the main \"basics\" of DIY photography.But therein lies a couple of real and legitimate problems: one of the main ones being that the \"instruction\" booklet is only available as a PDF file, so you need a computer to access it, as they've offered no \"physical\" paper-&-Ink booklet which would've been so much more convenient; and as far as the \"manual\" adjusting goes, the setting wheel is so close to the other buttons on the back which are so hyper-sensitive that great care and lots of practice must be taken in order to avoid unintended mishaps. The \"grainy\" resolution of the view screen is another area in which I can come down on the side of agreement (the Nikon L18, believe it or not, is superior in this aspect), but any talk about \"grainy pictures\" is just ludicrous -- again, it can often be about apperture and ISO settings and too much reliance on the \"automatic\" setting... \"nighttime/low-light\" situations, same thing, despite the fact that I've managed to take some remarkable photos in some of those very same night and low-light situations, EVEN ON THE \"AUTO\" SETTING!My only real complaint (other than the unavailability of a hard copy owner's manual) is that the SX160 has *NO* internal memory at all, not even in the slightest! (Heck! Even the Nikon \"Coolpix\" L18 comes with about 9-pictures worth of memory preinstalled), so in order to get any usage from the SX at all, you'll have to cough up them ducats for a good (\"fast\") memory card.Needless to say, I am (so far) very happy with this camera: it does pretty much everything I expected it to do, and then some! I can only hope as I experiment with it more and more that I will likewise grow more and more fond of it and receive much enjoyment from it. If the words of an \"Almost-Skeptic\" bear any weight in these reviews, then please allow me to say with no shame or regret...

It does what is claimed. Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The SX160 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a big x16 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The weight of the camera is 291 grams, which is light for its zoom.Overall, nice camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

The Transcend 16GB Class 10 card keeps me shooting as rapidly as I need to shoot.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "THIS MODEL BETTER THAN THE NEW MODEL", "Author": "SC GIRL \"EX-NYC\"", "ReviewID": "R3OHA9OQ8OZEV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't own the new model but I know that all of the specs of the old model and the new model are the same except one important aspect that was important to me. This model uses AA batteries. The newer model (the SX 170) uses a proprietary rechargeable lithium battery that costs $46. While shopping for a small point-and-shoot camera with a nice long zoom range, I spent days comparing prices, mega pixels, zoom lenses, and the cost for needed accessories. I like the Powershot SX in this group because even though it is small and light weight, it still has a \"handle\" making it easier to hold on to.In my shopping though, I was dismayed to realize that even the least expensive cameras in the range I was considering all but one used proprietary batteries. This particular model (the SX 160)  was not actually being listed by some vendors since the newer model was released (the SX 170). I was reading on Amazon, an extensive 3 star review by John Sturgeon of the SX 170 and in it he talks about the battery issue.He pointed out that if you use generic rechargeable batteries ($20) and your camera fails, your warranty is void for using the cheaper generic. I personally would never go out on an excursion on vacation without an extra battery. So you are paying something like $120 for a camera that costs you $46 plus tax and shipping so that you have a backup. This is similar to buying a printer for $200 only to find out later you are going to have to spend $90 to replace the ink cartridges ONE TIME.I had already had the experience of trying to find a camera that would use AA's and only found one which I think had a man zoom to something like the equivalent of 148 MM. After I read that review I started hunting for vendors where I could get the SX 160. I bought one for a friend for Christmas and one for me.This is my backup camera. I don't know if the color clarity meets my expectations yet. It is winter and the colors in the bushes, trees and lawns are pretty blah right now. I have tried to take pics of a Cardinal but I have to do that through a window since he is quite touchy and won't hang around even if I am too visible to him through the glass so that really cuts down on the quality of the photo.I think it is worth it's price because of the battery issue alone! The SX 170 right now is lower than the price I paid for this lower model. I strongly suggest using the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries. I currently use the non-rechargeable and they cost around $16 for a pkg of 8. For 1/3 the cost of 1 proprietary battery, you can buy 12 pairs of these batteries that Energizer guarantees will not damage your equipment. The rechargeable version of these batteries has recently been introduced but I haven't used them. Personally I would stress out when on vacation having to recharge batteries the end of each day and making sure you carried extra.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice, but Needs Stronger Batteries", "Author": "The Cat", "ReviewID": "R2CEABFDXR6X4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm changing my original review because I've gotten to use the camera more.____________________________________If you want a small camera to slip in and out of a purse, this is not for you. The SX 160 is a little bulky (which I don't mind), but that is probably because of the large lens. I'm not kidding, this is twice as thick as my Nikon Coolpix S3000, there is a grip on the side, which is helpful for one handed shots. The camera is a little heavy, but it's not too bad. You can decide which side to put the hand strap on because there are two holes for them.The flash does not pop up automatically. The camera tells you on the screen to pop up the flash. You have to press a little button. Once again, I don't mind.The screen is large and easy to read off of. The buttons are a good size, too. I like the Recording button that instantly starts shooting the video. That's very helpful, because there is a wheel on top that you use to change modes, which takes some time.Now for the image quality:The images are pretty good, even in bad lighting. The scenes are a little hard to find and the shutter speed may be unpredictable. It depends on what mode you are on. I find that the quickest shutter speed is on the low light mode.Like I said, the shutter speed can be random. It changes with every scene option, and you have almost no choice on changing it. There are a few scenes that have a quick speed that are amazing, though. When it is in a fast mode, the picture taken very quickly.The image quality is fantastic, on the camera screen and the computer screen. Most pictures aren't blurry, unless the shutter is really slow. The pictures turn out vivid and sharp.There are SO MANY MODES on this camera, and they're a little hard to find. It's not the most user friendly, but it's not that bad. I'm not an expert photographer or anything and I think I know the camera pretty well.The 16x zoom on this camera is fantastic. The images stay pretty clear as you zoom out more. I could zoom into a person's eye from across the room.I haven't played a lot with the video, but I've tried it out and I can hardly hear it. I think it's just because I have no idea how to turn the volume up.Now, the batteries. I had to.change the batteries twice, I think, the day I got this. I will admit that I was playing around for a while and taking lots of pictures, but still, it was ridiculous. This camera just needs strong batteries.Here's a list of PROS and CONS as a conclusion.PROS:-Great picture quality-Easy to hold-Good in low light-Good shutter speed (on certain modes)-Fantastic zoom-Lots of image options-Flash power can be changedCONS:-A little bulky-Some modes have awful shutter speeds-Needs stronger batteries-Takes some exploring to find featuresOverall a great camera and I would recommend it.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, but too bulky", "Author": "Eusebius", "ReviewID": "R3OH9N9CEJD8YN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me tell you I like this camera and but I'm sending it back to Amazon. I was looking for a light, simple automatic p&s; that I could stick in my pocket and take with me into the field where I record evidence of animal activity. The camera I need has to have AA batteries for power (there are no rechargers in the field and a $35 spare battery is no fun for me) and it's easier to pack a couple of spare AAs in my pocket. The SX-160 seemed to be the one!Comparing it to other small point and shoot cameras the problem is that it's just a little too bulky. It weighs in at 11 ounces (the A1100 is 7 ounces) and the lens barrel/back gives it a depth of about 1.75 inches. This is not a pocket camera. It is sort of intermediate to a digital SLR and a pocket point & shoot. All that being said, here what's good about this camera:The pictures are very good. When testing, I never failed to take at least an acceptable photo.The camera can be set to do ISO tracking, making it easier pick a detail to focus on.You can see what the final photo will actually look like with `exposure live view'There is a host of settings and special effectsLag time between shots is very short (except when using the flash)32x optical zoom and 64x(!) digital zoomHere's what what the problems are:The flash is not wholly automatic. If you need a flash, a message pops up on the screen telling you to pop up the flashThe flash has a long recharge time.It eats batteries quicker than other cameras in this class.It's not a pocket camera. It won't fit in a shirt pocket and is too bulky for a jacket  pocket.It really is a pretty good camera but I will settle for the newer Canon A1400.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "love my canon", "Author": "ang nc", "ReviewID": "R1XL1R1AEH4YER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this baby takes beautiful photos . delivery was fast and the price was right . it took me some time to get used to seting the picture up with the screen as it does not have a view finder . easy to use , even with all the functions .", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Zoom", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R2A52SDKWBFMWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera with a fantastic zoom feature.

We are a Canon family so while she looked at other brands, we all felt 'safer' sticking with a Canon.  (I had bought a water-resistant Fuji last year and think the photos turn out so-so).  She needs to be able to change the various settings (shutter speeds, lighting) and her point-and-shoot pink camera wasn't cutting it.  She loves this camera and is able to do more with her photography class assignments.This past weekend, I seemed to misplace my own Canon camera and wanted to take photos at her dance competition so I borrowed her camera (she was dancing, she didn't need it).  Luckily, I carry a big ol' handbag as the camera, while lightweight thanks to the plastic case, is rather large.  I loved that there's a button specifically to turn on the flash as flash photography isn't allowed.  On my own misplaced camera, you have to go to a couple of clicks to turn it off.I took photos from about 100 feet away, in a darkened room, of her dancing on stage.  On my camera, the photos would have turned out blurry and dark - basically un-usable.  With her Canon, I got great photos and I was using the AUTO setting.  I'm sure I could have captured the moving dancers better if I selected one of the 32 settings or even better went into manual mode.Now I'm looking for a replacement camera for myself since I can't find mine and since the camera technology has obviously improved.So why 4 stars and why am I not buying this one?

This camera was purchased at a store and I have now had it for a little less than a week.  Now for a sub $200 camera this is an amazing little gem. Play around with all the settings, make a slide show like did and post it to youtube like I did if you look under this camera its title will state Canon SX160 slide show.  The macro settings are great, the zoom can actually be aided up to 64x through the digital assistance.The battery life is very short if you use the conventional AA batteries however if you pick up a charging unit the life will excel far greater than the regular ones.  The Macro setting on this little camera is great, for what you get and pay, remember this is an affordable budget camera and point and shoot.Play around with the settings, like I have and you will find a host of features that this camera offers. There is a (slow motion) feature on the video program in (playback mode) that is so cool. I am no expert I am no Pro and I am no certified photographer however I am inquisitive enough to explore the options this camera has to offer.The Intelligent Auto setting is for the (lazy people) play around with the Manual (M) setting or program (P) setting and venture into other areas for higher quality photos.The Image Stabilization on this little fellow is awesome and the video is only 720HD not 1080HD and there is a vast difference with the two qualities.  If you are taking videos of something and need maximum zoom with digital assist you will need either a Monopod, tripod or sturdy base mount for no vibrations period.  Play around with the ISO range it is pretty wide from 100-1600 now that is awesome for a small inexpensive camera such as the Canon SX160 ISI highly recommend getting a screen protector even though it may alter the clarity somewhat however if you drop it and scratch the LCD well it is now compromised.16 X Optical Zoom scores a 10 not a 5 for the Digital assist is astonishing in this tiny camera wow (64x max with digital)16 Mp quality is good not great720HD video is good for the moneyFlash works well enoughPrograms on camera are greatEase of use is wonderful once you know what you are doing(no microphone adjust) this is a shame unless it is on here and I just cannot find it.Meaty camera that has some weight not feeling like it will blow away in the windImage Stabilization is wonderful, impressive on a camera so smallYes I would highly recommend this to another !!", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best Point And Shoot of the Market", "Author": "Rochelle D.

That makes it the perfect camera for rock concerts.  The camera also stabilizes your shot even if your hands shake a little.  There are no bad pictures with this camera!The camera uses regular batteries which I prefer because charging a battery slows you down.  If you're on the go, stock up on some batteries and go.  No worries about having to plug the battery in and wait until you have a full charge to shoot.Even better, the price is super reasonable.

Finally the next day it retracted. I have never had a problem with the previous models so I'm not sure it I got a lemon. The few pictures I did take indoors were grainy and out of focus. It seems like the beginning cameras in this line were way better than the latest models. This was my go to camera for concerts, not anymore. Sad because now I have to find another model I like better. The G15 takes amazing pictures in low light but it only has a 5x zoom. I have the T4i too but think my T1i just as well if not better.

My main complaint is that it takes a very long time to recover between pictures - especially when using the flash - you'll miss a lot of good shots waiting for it to reload - and it gobbles up AA batteries.  In addition, the zoom control is way too extreme - it's either fully engaged or not - makes it very difficult to zoom in or out just a little more or less - so after 30 seconds of trying to get it to stop in the right spot you finally just give up and take the picture wherever it stopped last - frustrating.  In reality, you don't really need this much zoom in a little camera like this - you'll see what I mean if you buy it.  However, it does take a nice picture and the wide-angle lens makes a huge difference - no problem getting entire rooms or landscapes in the picture.

Close up is good up to a few inches from the object, I used it to read very fine prints on electronics then viewed it in zoom mode. Tried all modes, can not get that great sunset shot like a very good camera. Screen has no frame to protect against scratch. Great pictures if your hands are very steady (standing still) and take time to half push the shutter to focus before pushing it all the way down.

I can hit any local store for regular ones and keep shooting... something you can not do with a fancy battery pack.The zoom in incredible to say the least... and FAST. I have the Canon SX130 IS, and purchased this one for a friend... now I'm jealous! The zoom is smoother, faster, and doesn't record the noise as did the 130. The images are crisp, and the detail at 12MP is superb. I find the camera to be a good weight and size and very easy to use. Plus... there are many special effects and filters built in.It has a PROGRAM mode where you can set the exposure, manual focus, etc... so you can do things that were formally in the realm of a $400 plus camera.

However, you can do night shots if you have a good flash.  I had no idea Canon has this frustrating very delayed flash.  I swear my 12 Megapixel Kodak Easy Share came through on every single flash immediately.  I assumed a Canon camera would be better.  I got out to do my night shots.  I must have tried to take 150 photos.  I couldn't tell if the camera was taking them or not.  I did not see a flash.  Only 6 photos came out of 150!  I was used to pointing, shooting and seeing the flash the minute I hit and released the camera button.  Taking multiple series of shots.  I admit to never using Canon and not reading the instructions.  Apparently you have to hold down the camera button, then there is a long delay while the camera tries to find it's focus.  So, I feel like I wasted $168, plus shipping.  This camera might take amazing daytime shots, but I simply will not work for my night shots.  I stupidly threw away the box and can not return the camera or I would.  It just won't work for my needs.  I wouldn't expect most camera to do night shots with clarity, but I would expect an immediate flash.  So this was just so upsetting.  I called Canon to ask if they have any cameras that flash immediately?  They suggested an SLR model, and said any other Canon Flashes the with the same delay.  So I wouldn't even try another  Canon.  I would have been better off with a 16mp pocket aim and shoot camera.  I just ordered the camera a week ago and it's just sitting in the drawer with me questioning what will I use it for?  I am not one of those people who complain.  I am usually a person who likes everything I buy and never sends anything back.  If I would have kept the box ... the SX160 would be on it's way to return.

I've been buying Canon cameras for quite a while and have always been very pleased with them.

It is not a Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black), which I suppose is what most of us really want in the end. (Better CMOS sensor, better 20x zoom, better 30fps HD video, better hi-res LCD. (Don't need no steekin' GPS. But the 240SX isn't sold in the USA.)) But the SX260 cost almost $100 more than what I paid for the SX160 and the SX260 doesn't run on AA batteries, which is of prime importance to me. If Canon made an AA version of the SX260, stuffing the better guts of the 260 into the body of the 160, I'd jump. But since Canon doesn't, the SX160 will suffice.Long review to follow. Pick and choose what you want to read.For comparison purposes, my previous camera, still working well, is a Canon PowerShot A540. A 6MP, 4x optical, AA powered, full featured camera. (Has Manual mode, for example.) I was looking to upgrade to a similar AA battery powered camera with Image Stabilization (IS) and more zoom. (Those expensive, proprietary Li-ions are always dying on you in the middle of nowhere. If you don't carry a spare, you need to carry a charger and find 120v AC. Whereas carrying or finding extra AA's with you on a trip is cheap backup.) The pickin's for AA powered cameras are slim.Pickin's are even slimmer if you're looking for a two-cell camera. (Four AA batteries, unless Lithium AA, make a camera too heavy for my taste.) At the time I bought the SX160, I could only find two candidates: One, the low end Canon's, like the Canon PowerShot A1300 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 5x Digital Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording (Silver) for $100. And the SX160 for a little more.---------UPDATE - Check out the Sony DSC-H200 Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black). Costs about the same as the SX260. Not pocketable, and 4 cell. But might be a better camera. Optical zoom while recording video.UPDATE  - I just learned about the Pentax X-5 Digital Camera with 26x Optical Zoom and 3\" LCD (Black), a four cell AA camera. Fry's Electronics is selling it for $200 this week.  CMOS sensor, 26x zoom, high display LCD, Electronic viewfinder, etc. It won't fit in your pocket, but some say the SX160 won't either and needs a case. See the customer image of the moon there and compare to mine here.UPDATE - There is now also the new Nikon COOLPIX L610 16 MP Digital Camera with 14x Zoom NIKKOR Glass Lens and 3-inch LCD (Black) two AA camera with arguably better specs: CMOS sensor, higher res LCD; 30fps HD video (plus slo-mo 60fps), glass lens, better ergonomic body design. All for the same price as the SX160. (But no optical zoom when recording movies.) The L610 is narrowly focused on the \"point and shoot\" consumer market only. It doesn't have PASM which would be a deal breaker for many.----------The A1300 would have met my requirements, albeit a 5x zoom isn't much of an increase from my ol' 4x. But you get a lot more bang for the buck with the SX160.So when the price of the SX160 dropped to $150, I jumped. I bought it with a Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E card that Amazon impulse-marketed me when I ordered the camera, which is more than enough capacity. (Update: And which CrystalDiskMark's above 10MB/sec write.)Since everyone else here is focusing on the positives, I'll primarily focus on the negatives to round out the reviews. (camera. focus. negatives. get it?) UPDATE: For example, as others are saying here, it is a tad slow with respect to shutter lag. Been taking pictures of a very energetic spaniel. Seems to be about a 1/4 second delay in what the camera captures after I press the shutter - even with the focus and exposure set to manual (so that there's nothing for the camera to think about).And so that you know as you read this review, I never used the automatic features in my A540, like the AUTO mode or AiAF. I don't expect to be using these or all the new \"tracking, face finding, anti-blink\" stuff they've put in the SX160 now. (Although they are fascinating to watch in action.) I know how to focus, and I primarily use the Program mode for 99% of my photos.Ergonomics: My previous camera, the Canon Powershot A540, had a protrusion on the right front of the body, near where the batteries go, which made a fantastic hand hold. (A so-called \"Grip.\") Exactly like what Canon still does on the A3100. (And A810.) Such a grip places your finger more naturally on the shutter button and zoom control too. (See my customer images.)Unfortunately, even though Canon knew how to do it with the A540 and knows how do it in the A3100, the SX160IS does not have this important ergonomic feature. (Sometime shortly after the A540, the body design on the PowerShots changed to resemble the ELPH's. Now they've brought back the old A540 style in the A3100. It's what customers want.) In fact, since there's no grip per se and since the camera is heavier (bigger lens) and longer, it tends to lever out of your hand. You cannot easily hold the camera with one hand without it rotating CCW.They put a chrome-colored strip on the front to give your fingertips a place to anchor, but that's more like using your fingertips while rock climbing. As such, you'll definitely want to use the wrist strap (included) with this camera as a safety net for when it slips and falls out of your hand.(See my fuzzy strip mod in customer images which makes the camera significantly easier to hold.) As it is now, you have to pinch the camera with your thumb and fingers. (More on that later.) Which makes it basically a two-handed camera.As such, I often end up unintentionally covering up the AF assist beam with a finger, since it's kinda close to the upper left part of the camera.Zoom noise in video: Unlike reviewer Yarii's, my camera was made in Malaysia. (Not Japan, like hers.) And unlike reviewer Yarii's, I can hear more \"zoom noise\" (a \"whirring\" of gears) in my camera than hers when zooming while taking movies. (Find her video on YT by searching for \"Canon SX160 Zoom Motor Noise Test.\" Turn your volume up all the way if you want to hear the noise.) I've posted a sample video with this review of what mine sounds like during zoom.The manual warns the camera might record mechanical noise while zooming. Fair enough. Better than muting the audio, as some manufacturers do. I noticed, during the many takes of making my video for you, the whirring came and went. So maybe after the gears \"break in\" (what a horrible thought) the noise will stop?Battery compartment: The markings that show the proper orientation for the AA batteries are merely black letters in the black plastic inside the black (dark) battery compartment. Hard for aging eyes to see the polarity marks. See my Metallic Sharpie mod in customer images to mitigate this.Read the Manual: For the most part, the menu and buttons are like my old A540. But different enough that I'm going to have to read the PDF manual on the CD.Nit: Unfortunately, the CD won't play in my computer. (A late model PC.) Will try in someone elses box and see what happens. (Update: CD plays in a friend's computer. Cheap media?) BTW, the User's Guide on the Canon website is now up to version CDD. (Revised from CDC on the CD. I don't know what changed.)Features & more ergonomics: After reading the User Guide (twice) - wow, what a feature rich camera! I doubt I'll be able to remember all the trick things it can do. (And I'm an engineer type, who finds it easy to remember geeky stuff like that.) Among them are several \"safety features.\" The camera can automatically keep you from overexposing on flash. You can set it to double check your focus for you when you use Manual Focus. Etc. (I said I don't use that Auto stuff. But I do let it help me here.) UPDATE: I've been experimenting with continuous focus, tracking AF, servo AF, etc. while taking pictures of a very energetic spaniel. It's not clear to me what the subtle differences are of those features. It would help if Canon would explain more in the manual how Servo AF differs from say, Tracking AF, and why you'd select one over the other.====UPDATE: Just got back from taking photos from a small plane. I dearly miss the old \"Landscape\" scene mode, which set the Manual Focus to infinity for you. I can set the Manual focus to infinity by hand on the SX160 (3 steps), but since I have Safety MF set to ON, the camera often decrements the focus in flight down from infinity. I dunno why. Maybe it sees a reflection on the canopy? Clouds aren't the easiest thing to focus on either. So now I need to remember to do a fourth step to take landscapes: turn off Safety MF.16:9 format simply cuts off the top and bottom of 4:3 format. Better to leave the camera in 4:3 and crop at home for 16:9 as you desire.So Canon, how about a dedicated Landscape mode again that sets MF to infinity and turns off Safety MF? There's room on the Mode dial for it.====Even if I could remember all the trick things it could do, it's difficult to make it do them all. That's because some features require you press half way down the smallish shutter button while simultaneously pressing another button on the camera, presumably with your thumb. There's a small thumb friction pad area on the back side of the camera, expecting you'll be pinching the camera there to hold it. But when your thumb-your opposing grip-moves to push a button, you lose your grip on the camera!  So if you move your thumb to access one of these two step inputs, you need to use two hands.But even if I could do the tricks, I don't want to do all the trick things this camera can do. Why would I want to fisheye a photo in the camera? Why not take a good shot and fisheye it later on software at home? Same with B/W scene. I can take the color out at home. Or why would I edit a shot on a dinky lowish res LCD on the camera when I can edit it on a larger laptop or desktop screen later?[I haven't played much with the AUTO mode, but it's clear a lot of the resources of this camera were spent on first time users (i.e., point and shoot) who apparently want gee-whiz gimmickry tricks. Like \"Read my mind and take the picture for me.\"]Image Stabilization inconsistency: The manual says that YOU need to turn off image stabilization when on tripod. Others here say it turns off automatically. As does the description here on Amazon: \"When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.\" Which is it?Ahhh... the answer is that when the Intelligent IS notices that the camera isn't moving (via the built in accelerometer), the IS turns off. Goes into \"tripod\" mode.\" But it doesn't really detect a tripod. It'll go into \"tripod\" mode if stationary on a table.However, in any other mode but Auto, the User Guide says you need to turn IS off when using a tripod. Why? Simply to save power? I dunno. Does it affect picture quality? Apparently it could. I found this quote in a Samsung camera manual about their IS mode with tripod: \"If you use the OIS function with a tripod, your images may be blurred by the vibration of the OIS sensor. Deactivate the OIS function when using a tripod.\" Interesting. As an engineer, I can understand how dithering of the IS due to circuit noise could degrade an image if taken on tripod. So, then, maybe you should turn IS off when on tripod?But upon more testing, I found this isn't necessary with the SX160. The IS turns off automatically in any mode when on tripod. It just won't annunciate to you with an icon that IS has turned off (that is, entering \"tripod mode\") as shows in AUTO. So the Guide seems inconsistent, telling you to turn IS off on tripod. You don't have to.[I've taken demanding shots of the a street sign at night at 15 seconds (ISO 100, f5.6 full zoom) in M mode on a tripod with IS manually enabled/disabled. (See my customer image.) No difference that I can discern with IS on/off when pixel peeking. Moreover, I can jiggle the camera on the tripod with IS ostensibly enabled but I can tell the IS has turned itself off. (That is, when I jiggle the camera, the LCD image will jiggle for a half second, showing the IS was off. And then it'll suddenly lock in after the camera is jiggled, showing the IS comes back on. So the camera does turn IS off automatically for you when the camera is stationary.]More ergonomics: The four way multi-button has a rotating bezel around it. Hmmm... some cute feature someone in Marketing came up with? You can do almost everything with the Left/Right toggle that you can do by rotating the bezel. But there are a few things you can ONLY do with the Left/Right toggle that you can't do by rotating the bezel. And there are a few things you can only do with the bezel you can't do with the buttons. So it's inconsistent and I often find myself hitting left/right when I should rotate. They should change it so you use one or the other for certain tasks, but not both.FWIW, I'm a 6 foot skinny man, and my hands aren't as large as your average mid-west farmer type male. I can spin the bezel fairly well, but I sometimes toggle left/right by accident when rotating the bezel. I'd be surprised if a large burly man with big fingers can use it well. (A timer that inhibited toggle for a quarter second after using the bezel would minimize this problem.)Blinkie: Not stated obviously in the User Guide (I didn't understand what they were trying to say until I searched the web on how to read histograms and learned about \"Blinkies\"), one of the Display pages for reviewing your photos (the page with the histogram) blinks overexposed parts of your image in pseudo-reverse video. Canon might want to offer blinkie off/on on the basic review page too. A very handy feature.Counter-intuitive Movie mode: The way Movie mode works is counter-intuitive. On my old A540 (and another reviewer here tells me as late as the SX130), when you were in the Movie mode and pushed the shutter button, guess what? It started taking movies! But now it takes a snapshot. (But I have no idea what mode it takes a snapshot in when you're in Movie mode. Does it revert to Auto? Your \"P\" settings?) Anyway, when in the Movie mode, you still have to press the Movie button to start a movie. (A reviewer here says the Movie button will follow certain scene settings. The manual implies that too. It does, but it's subtle. For example, taking a movie at night in Fireworks mode makes the colors of street lights a little more orangish.)Maybe I'm missing something, but I see no reason to ever switch to Movie mode on this camera to take a movie. I'll just start movies from the \"P\" mode, where I'm usually at. (A YouTube reviewer on the Canon SX260 says you only go into Movie mode to select iFrame format. The Guide says you can control exposure (\"brightness\") of movies only in the Movie mode.)It records movie audio in \"stereo.\" Two mics, maybe two inches apart. Pretty useless stereo. Perhaps a marketing feature. Hey, Canon, if you're reading this, if you go back to mono and phase the two mic's, maybe you can get some directionality out of them? THAT would really be a marketing feature!Another \"neat idea\", wouldn't it be neat if the Auto-magnify AF thingie painted a green box around the zoom area after it acquired focus? That would give more user feedback that you've locked focus.Another neat feature would be \"Maximum AUTO ISO.\" That is, I'd like to set it so it can select the ISO automatically but not go past 400. (For example.) Graininess is too much past 400. (Either that or make the images less noisy in the first place.)Paparazzi mode: Continuous mode shooting is a lot slower than my old A540. The SX160 isn't anywhere near as fast as old film cameras that you'd hear go \"click, click, click.\" (Tested with M1, Fine on the SX160.) Interestingly, the delay doesn't seem to be longer at L. Or shorter at S and Superfine. Must be a bottleneck elsewhere.In the manual, it says the special low light level scene will take fast continuous shots. it's true. It flies in that mode. 2.8 shots/sec according to the Guide. (But no Date stamp. I wonder what else they're not post processing?) But who's going to remember you have to take two steps to get into this fast continuous mode? (Incidentally, in this low light mode, I've seen ISO as high as 6400.)[Here's an interesting test to see how long it takes Canon to post-process before writing to your SD card. Take the SD card out and take a photo. It'll be a second or so before the camera tells you it can't write the image to memory. So it's doing a lot of thinking in there. I wonder if we're really making progress with fancy processors and the push for more MP?]Wish list: I realize I'm asking too much at this price point, but I miss a viewfinder for sunny days when it's hard to see the screen. Even an Electronic Viewfinder would be helpful, although where would they put it with the flash there already? (Moving the flash where there did on the SX160 and making it pop up with a push of a button was a big improvement over the auto popup many reviewers didn't like on the Canon SX230.) Anyway, I can see the screen in direct sun in Arizona. Usable, albeit a little washed out. (I really like that \"Hold the DISP button to get max brightness\" feature.) Glare is sometimes a problem and I sometimes see the reflection of my face in the LCD. (Of course I put a screen protector on the LCD.)Flash: Speaking of flash, the new Slow Syncho feature is a clever way to mitigate the notorious weak flash in the PowerShot line. Effectively increases the flash range.I notice too that the flash recharge/recycle time is faster than my old A540, using the same batteries. So that's better. But it still takes a second or two between flash shots.===UPDATE: I have my SX160 set for 3 seconds of detailed review, so I can study the photo and histogram of the image I just took. But when you use flash, the display shuts off immediately after a shot while the flash is charging. Canon does that so they can send more power to charge the flash and recycle faster. But by the time the flash charges, the review timeout is over and you can't see the image you just took!I wonder if Canon could stuff two BFC's (Big Fat Capacitor) in there for the flash, alternating between them to drive the flash? That way, after taking one flash picture, you'd have the second BFC come on line, already charged for the next shot. The capacitor that just drained can then charge more leisurely in the background so the display can stay on all the time. Call it \"Burst2Flash\" and patent it.===Zooming on Zoom: Interestingly, the zoom lever is not pressure sensitive. You're either zooming or you're not. At full speed. No fast/slow. I never noticed it's that way on my old A540 too. But there's so much zoom on the SX160, the motor is too fast for me for still images. (It's slower when taking movies, per my video clip above.) It's hard to frame a zoom shot just right for stills. Seems like Canon figured you'd be either all in or all out. They should either slow the zoom down (easy firmware fix) or make a two step zoom. (Expensive hardware change.)Quality Control: I have one or two pixels stuck somewhere. (Brand new out of the box.) When I go into a dark room and look at the display, I see two pixels stuck on the LCD. (User Guide says this can't be helped.) When I take a photo of the moon and review it on the computer, I see one stuck pixel in the actual image. See my customer image, above. (I called Canon. One pixel does not a defective camera make for warranty return purposes. Said they would fix if very obviously bad.)Otherwise, the picture quality seems fine to me, even at L SF. Dynamic range is best with L SF. (Since a 16GB card holds 1000 L SF images, and since the camera isn't any slower processing L SF images, I see no reason to not use L SF all the time. Better to have too much image data than too little.)A UK magazine review was critical of the image quality, saying it was only average. Said noise starts to be a problem at ISO 200 and up. Yes, there's about 30% more noise from 100 to 200. (A WAG. Hey, it's only a CCD sensor. Not CMOS.) But pictures seem as good, if not better, than my old A540. So I'm content. (After doing my moon shot, I searched Google images and found some shots of the moon like mine, taken with 20X Canon cameras. They were amazing. But those were $500 CMOS units with better lenses.)Conclusion: While I said this review would focus mostly on the negative, if you can live with the ergonomic shortcomings (I can) it's a good buy. Especially at this price point. Especially considering I'm moving up from an old Canon A540. I simply wanted an improved version of it, an AA powered camera with more zoom, image stabilization, (silent) optical zoom in movie mode and better flash. (I don't care about HD video. 640 at 30fps is fine for YouTube and Amazon reviews.) This is a big improvement for me. If you're coming from last year's model, say the Canon SX150, maybe not so much.The SX160 IS is about as close as I can get right now to the grown up A540 I wanted. A camera to throw in my bag or pocket, to always have with me whenever I need a camera that's better than a cell phone camera. I don't need a perfect image. Just one that's good enough.

Well you will quickly find out that there are very few cameras that do not use a battery pack,  and it does not matter what price range, the under $100 cameras or higher priced cameras , there are only a few.So that was one reason why I chose this camera, and based off a lot reveiws I read, it seem to be a good buy, so I went for it, and so far I like it, I have had not even a month yet, so I am still getting use to it, but it takes great pics, and video's .  Like many have said, its not an action camera,  it can be if you have proper lighting,  and trying to take pics of a 16month that does not stand still very long can result in blurry pics, but so far, it has been well worth the money.One thing I am not liking so far is not having a battery meter on screen, or anywhere, there may be one, but I have not found it yet.  And on other thing I dont like, is not being able to pause while recording video, my 5/6 year camera could, my BB 9850 lets you pause while recoding .  But its still not a deal breaker, I guess if you want to shoot video, get a video camera lol.The size , well its not big, not small, its right in that middle area that might be too big to fit in pants pocket, unless you wear cargo pants( I do), or you are a female that carrys a very small purse( I am not, and dont),  this might a camera that if you want to carry around, you might want to get a camera belt case, or wear pants with big pockets.Other then those little things,  and dont let them put you off buying this camera, its a really decent camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for money", "Author": "Antoni Stoychev", "ReviewID": "R265J5330W3FUU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As far it's as good as I expected.

One thing that's definitely unsatisfactory about the SX160 is how long you have to wait for the flash to charge before you can use it.  That says something in itself.  A built-in flash that has to charge?  That's a throwback to the 80s!  Makes me think of the old Vivitar camera I grew up with.  On top of it all, the camera body feels like cheap plastic.

The primary use was to take pictures of items to be sold on a large wEst coast Big Auction companY. Upgraded to the SX160, or so I thought... Used this camera for a couple of days and found the pictures to be grainy, blurry, while colors were not true, always washed out with blues being emphasized. While the pictures are of high resolution, they are not as nice as those taken with the Nikon L22. Even after adjusting ISO to low levels and using heavy duty lighting, the pictures were grainy and blurry; my customers did notice with comments like; \"buy a new camera\", \"can you send me some better pics\", and \"stop using your iPhone for your pics\". Amazon as always, is first rate to their buyers; they took back the camera for a full refund.Pros:Lightweight, pretty color, nicely packagedCons:Takes nasty, grainy, blurry pictures despite camera mode/setting changes and adjustments.Summary:Perhaps I received a \"lemon\", but \"it is what it is\".  If you don't really care what your pictures look like, this camera would be a great camera for you. Beyond that, I don't find anything useful about the SX160.Note: I gave the L22 to my nephew as a gift so without a camera to work with, I purchased a Canon T3 DSLR at a large electronics FiRm in YeS, California for $350. Will give that a try.********************* UPDATE ******************************The Canon T3 DSLR arrived two days ago and I'm happy to report that it is absolutely AWESOME. The picture quality is stunning, the photos are crisp and sharp, and the colors are perfect even when set to auto mode. I'd recommend the T3 to anyone needing a good online auction camera. Glad this finally worked out.

I have slightly compromised strength in my right hand due to injury, and it was uncomfortable to try to operate with one hand; which I need to do because I use it for my job and the other hand is full of my clipboard.Flash. You have to push a button to manually pop the flash up. If you are trying to operate the camera one handed it is pretty difficult to get the flash up. Then of course, you have to push it back down before you put it away. The flash also takes a really long time to charge, which is pretty annoying.Body. The body is plastic, and feels cheap.
