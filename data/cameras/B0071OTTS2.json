The camera was defective. I sent it back and was told I would be shipped a new one when I called in with my ups tracking number. This was false information. I called multiple times to requesting to speak to a manager to have him not get on the phone and not return my calls. They finally received my camera and then stated it had water damage and that it was not returned in the return time period (which the request was well within the return time but it had to ship across the country). When I finally did speak to the manager he was arrogant and rude. They finally 3 weeks later shipped my camera back stating Sony fixed it for free because it was not water damaged. By this time I had already stopped payment with my credit card company and purchased my new DSLR from Best Buy which works perfectly. Thanks to Chase for siding with me. The manager continued to send me emails stating that my credit card company sided with them. SUNSET ELECTRONICS ARE CROOKS. ERIC THE MANAGER IS A CROOK. DO NOT BUY ELECTRONICS FROM THEM. THEY SEND OUT USED DEFECTIVE ITEMS AND THEN BLAME YOU FOR BREAKING THEM. I have never written a online review before and will probably never write another one but this was such a bad experience that I had to share.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$784.00", "Features": "24.3Mp APS-C Sensor\nOLED Viewfinder\n3.0\" Swivel LCD Screen\n1080 HD Movie Capture\nSteadyShot INSIDE Stabilization", "Name": "Sony a (alpha) SLT-A65 (A65v) - Digital Camera - SLR - 24.3 Mpix - Sony DT 18-55mm lens - SSE Package: 0.45x Wide Angle Lens, 2x Telephoto Lens, 3 Piece Filter Kit (UV,CPL,FLD) 4 Piece Macro Close-Up Kit, Replacement FM500H Battery, Rapid Travel Charger, Carrying Case, HDMI Cable, Flash & SSE Microfiber Cleaning Cloth", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BU1X6IkZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0071OTTS2"}}
