Dees \"repair-bad-credit-fast dot com\"", "ReviewID": "R21EWZATWLZLER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Be aware that they are a bit of a Chinese puzzle to open for battery installation. You have to turn the base counter clockwise to release the ball (the part that looks like the camera), being careful not to drop the ball. Then you have to do the same with the ball to open the battery compartment - and be careful when opening the ball! Two thin battery wires attach the two halves. Break one and you'll need to do a soldering job.Plan on finding a few screws to replace those provided for mounting. They are made of some type of hardened butter substance that strip out if you meet any resistance when mounting the camera. No big deal, though. I found replacements easily enough in my junk drawer (who doesn't keep a collection of \"just-in-case\" screws, nuts, and bolts?).I purchased 2 of these fakes to be used as an enhancement to a real 24/7 DVR system I previously installed. These fakes were placed in areas that were \"blind\" to my recorder because my 4 camera system couldn't provide 100% coverage of my home. I placed my real cameras to cover vital areas of my property and used these fakes to cover the remaining, but non-critical areas.I'm still undecided about the blinking red light. Personally, I'd prefer a constantly lit light that would more closely resemble a real Infra-Red working camera. However, The blinking light does get the attention of potential thieves who would undoubtedly take a second look before proceeding further and likely see my real cameras.As far as my neighbors know, every camera is real (they saw me installing the real system) and this is the key to using fakes.1. NEVER reveal to anyone which cameras are fake. A trusted neighbor may have a friend or family member who is a thief.2. Placement should be out of reach and at a height that would prevent a close visual inspection.3. They should never be used as the only \"security\" method for a home, but in conjunction with a real surveillance system.I purchased mine when they were 4 dollars each and though I see now (at the time of this review) they have increased more than 60% in price, they are still cheaper than other similar fakes and I still recommend them.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great works as expected", "Author": "Sincere", "ReviewID": "R35UR80URVFIZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price it worked as it should my neighbors thought it was real i love it worth it if you want an cheap alternative deterrent", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK for the money", "Author": "Richard k Rose", "ReviewID": "R2LBF76KED8ZOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone knows this is a fake camera so and think this is the only one.

It would be nice if they included a real label from a different product on the fake camera as well.Also the camera lens is noticeably different but I don't think potential thieves would inspect it that closely. The sticker would go a long way though in convincing people it's a real camera.If you have a little more to spend, but you just aren't going to invest in a real system, it may be worth paying $30-$60 for a real one of these instead, just to leave it disconnected.
