I wanted something I can easily put in my pocket and pull out to quickly take pics.I investigated several different point-and-shoot cameras, and they all suffer that is pretty much standard issues with Point and Shoots - not dealing well with low light, blurry when compensating for low light, lag time, etc.  These things are pretty much a fact with point and shoots.After playing with a few different camera's, I opted for the Lumix DMC-FH20.  The main reasons where the zoom - 8x optical, and then up to 32X digital with the right settings.On my trip, this camera did not disappoint.  Sure I had to play with the settings a little bit to get the desired effect, but I pretty much only used the Auto, Landscape, Nighttime landscape and Macro settings.  All of these worked perfectly.In low light, I had to stabilize the camera on a bench or fence, but that's expected, and not a downfall of the camera.Overall, I love this camera and considered it well worth the price I paid (about $180us).

It's excellent. It feels substantial when you hold it; it's easy to use and priced right. The pictures are extremely clear and sharp regardless light conditions or movement.

As the owner of a panasonic lumix fz50, I was very excited to see this small and compact camera, since my other lumix is bulky (10MP, 12X), When i saw the price for this camera, a 14mp, 8X I knew i had to have it. I took it to my trip to disney with a full charged battery and the battery sustained up to 14 hours of continuous photo sessions in different places around the park, it never died on us, but we charged it every night to make sure the next day it would last the same. The pictures are great, they do have some noise in dark places but that is to be expected. The image stabilization does an amazing job at getting pics without flash that are taken in the dark, i was surprised with that. We took some really awesome pictures with this camera. It weights close to nothing and it fits right in my pocket, it was the best purchase i ever made for the trip. I do have to say i am not particularly impressed with the video quality, except for the HD. the HD is pretty cool, but you need an sd card with massive storage to get a good recording time because it takes a lot, a lot of space. I bought an 8gb sd card which held about 1200 pictures at 14mpx, but i took my pics at 10 mp since i don't think i will be printing this pics at a large size. Overall i think this camera is amazing, it also has a pretty awesome lcd which is big enough for you to know what you're doing, and there's no viewfinder, which i like to use every now and then, but i can live without.

Although it is made in China,the quality seems remarkably great on the outside. Since I have only had it for a few weeks, it has not had a chance to stand time yet.I have not been so attracted to a small camera since my wife purchased my first Elph years ago. It has quite a few features that one sets by the menu system. I found that I need to reduce the exposure compensation at least one full stop or it overexposed most of my outdoor pictures. Also, most people will probably want to set the ISO at 400 so that pictures are not blurry.I do miss the Nikon software on my digital SLR that allows me to save the picture in RAW format and a smaller JPEG to mail people at the same time. Surprisingly, it doesn't take a long time for a 14 megapixel file to save to the card. I am using class 4 memory cards with no problems.I bought another battery through Amazon. You have to use the actual Lumix battery. Panasonic says this is for your safety, but I think it really is for their bottom line. They run around $30. My replacement battery, however, was made in Japan instead of China and had more power than the original. You need to have a spare battery because you just can't find these everywhere. Just figure this into your cost.The 8x zoom is all I need in this type of camera. It is amazing that an 8X zoom will fit in a camera that is about 1 1/8\" deep, 2 1/4\" wide, and 3 7/8\" long. Igive Panasonic a minus five for not giving accurate dimensions anywhere.  As with most products from Asia these days, the instructions and information about the product is far from stellar.Now they just need to come up with a great extended warranty to give people more peace of mind.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "No zoom in video mode - returned mine", "Author": "Beth L.", "ReviewID": "R32WINNMAQBY80", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have an older Lumix that I have been using for 5 years.

BUT, I ended up returning it because you cannot adjust the zoom in video mode!  I was very surprised that a feature in my 5 yeard old camera didn't exist in this new 'improved' model.  You can zoom in before starting recording if you want, but you cannot adjust zoom while you're videoing.Just wanted to warn anyone who plans to use their new camera for videos.

The stabilization feature really makes it possible to zoom that much and yet obtain a crystal-clear picture. The optical image stabilization has also allowed us to shoot pictures from moving ships and cars with great results. While the pictures taken outdoors really convince with natural colors and crispness, the images taken indoors at low light show quite a bit of graininess, the only complaint really that we have. So far we haven't made too many movies, but we bought a class 6 SDHC card after realizing that otherwise it takes a long time for movies to download to the computer. The battery life has also been satisfactory, however, if you intend to use the camera to take HD movies, battery life will very likely be much less. So far we have been able to take >200 pictures with one battery. If you buy the optional battery, which has more power, it'll last even longer. Oh, and to be able to take movies you have to browse through the menu, there is no designated button just for that.

I suppose technically I didn't need to buy a new camera, but the Sony had started to get a little glitchy and I'm going on some trips in the near future that I knew I'd want to document. Plus I had a little extra money to spend...I was prepared to spend $250+ on my new camera, but after looking at lots of reviews, I decided on this one.When I got the camera, the first thing I did was to take some test shots (indoors and outdoors) with the Panasonic and my old Sony. Initially, I was little disappointed with the indoor pictures my new camera took compared to the old camera. The outdoor pictures were clearly superior,  however.After playing around with it a little, though, I figured out that all I needed to get the indoor pictures up to snuff was to adjust the exposure by +1. This made a world of difference. Outdoors in bright light, the Auto Intelligent feature works great.I'm sure as I encounter different environments for taking pictures I'll have to play with the settings a little more, but I'm confident this camera offer superior quality to my Sony and is a good replacement for simple high-quality point and shoots needs.It would be nice if the Auto Intelligent feature took care of all this right out of the box.

It's small, so it fit in a pocket or snugly in a knapsack. The default settings were perfect for posed shots with people as well as scenery, and the automatic stabilization meant that ZERO pictures came out blurry (this impressed me since my pictures always seemed to blur with my previous camera). The most impressive thing wasn't even a feature we bought the camera for though - while on Odaiba (an island in Tokyo bay) at night, we had an excellent view of the lit-up Tokyo skyline and Rainbow Bridge. We decided to take a picture using the Night Scenery setting, not really expecting much but willing to give it a shot. WOW. Easily the best picture this total photography neophyte has ever taken.

We considered buying the Panasonic SZ1, SZ3, SZ5, SZ6 and even the SZ7.  These cameras have similar and even better features than the FH20, and the latter all have Leica Lens, and all these cameras are rated highly.  When our FH20's people pics were transferred to a 19\" screen, the colors were so poor in facial features as to be unacceptable.  All the people pics looked cyanotic and it was impossible to post process the images to improve the bluish lips and sickly appearance that the Panasonic electronics suffered on all the people images we captured.  This was true regardless of the lighting when these numerous images were acquired.  To minimize subjectivity, I strongly suggest visiting [...] and evaluating images on 'Comparometer'.  Compare the mannequin color with a known, good image, or simply transfer your people images to your own computer and assess faces, lips, eyes etc.  Returned our FH20 today after two weeks of taking pictures.Would still really like a compact point and shoot with all the great features of the before listed Panasonic Lumix cameras but desire the pics of people to look healthy and show correct contrast, saturation and hues.  I was unable to fix any of our deficient 'people' images with \"Photoshop Elements\".  We currently own a 2006 Canon A630 and a 2008 Canon SX10is and we'd purchase a Canon SX200is or a SX210is, for better people pics.  Want a compact that has similar features as the listed \"Lumix\", but the listed Canons SX's are pricier and also have their own flaws.My background includes years of experience with SLR film cameras as well as digital image acquisition and subsequent post processing.  Still looking to buy a digital with features most similar to the Panasonic Lumix ZS5, but want and demand better people images.

With the 14mp you can really zoom and crop any of your photos later on.Worked very well on low light birthday cake candle settings and sunsets even on auto mode. Image stabizaton worked great taking photos from the car.16:9 mode is a must have feature these days and works well when showing on new PCs or TVs.Video clarity is amazing for this type of camera, even though you can not zoom while the video is running, it is still a very good alternative to a seperate camera.  Be sure to consider a large 8 or 16gb flash card if you want to use the video and still have room for photos. There are now super fast \"class 10\" flash cards available that may be a good investment.One item is there is no cable for camera to HDMI TV input, so you have to use something else to display movies/photos on your TV.Like most cameras these days, there are many nice features to review the photos you have taken such a thumbnail view with many per page and the ability to zoom in on the photo you are reviewing.

My first two Panasonic Lumix cameras were the more expensive high end FX12 and FX33 ultra compacts and I didn't think the quality of this camera would be quite as good as the Leica lens FX series. I was pleasantly surprised with the new features and the quality of the FH20. The reason I was attracted to this camera other than another FX was the lower price (I am on a very scrawny budget), and twice the zoom (which is allot better than most ultra compact digital cameras), which was enough along with all the positive reviews for me to get the FH20 instead. And boy did I make the right choice. This camera looks allot nicer than my older ones with its highly polished brushed aluminum finish and you can feel the quality of the camera just by holding, it is indeed a very sturdy little thing. The detail in the pictures blow me away, but don't expect SLR quality. I love the macro zoom mode, the digital zoom doesn't degrade image quality at all. HD video is magnificent, even on my enormous TV. There are no real issues with this camera that I can see being an experienced amateur photographer.If you are looking for an easy to use pocketable camera that doesn't take allot of brain to operate but still produces excellent photos in all scenarios than this is the right camera.

Apfelbeck", "ReviewID": "R2LHYXOP6ORWUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes good pictures on sunny days (even if the photo has part shade)and nice photos with flash of close up subjects.  The flash will light up a pitch black room.  However, if you insert a person indoors some distance away, the room and person will appear someone dark (a casual shot from the side without allowing the camera to hit face detect and focus on the person). On cloudy days outdoors, the camera takes darker pictures than I like. So it's a mixed bag--the daylight, bright day photos are quite sharp up until you full zoom, but then the far end of the zoom can get a tad blurry.So I think this camera, which is very fast at focusing and fun to use, would work for family photos IF it can face detect and you are close enough to the people indoors.  Outdoors in good light it should work fine.  General scenery and yard type photos would do well as long as there is light.I cannot quite give it a 5 rating, however, because of the poor low light ability outdoors on cloudy days and the darker photos indoors unless you are close to the subject.The lenses on these small Panasonics are a bit \"slow\" (3.3 to 5.9 vs. 3.3 to 4.9 on the bigger cameras), but as long as you are taking wide angle shots or only zooming part way out (to leave the f stop at 5.3 or below), the photos are quite clear.  Also, this camera has a slower USB port than most and takes a little patience downloading if you have more than just a few photos at a time.Bear in mind that for most scenery shots this camera did a fine job, and that I did NOT try out the \"cloudy\" scene setting on darker days.I decided to send this back and get one with a Leica lens, hoping that might clear up the troubles. The Panasonic DMC-ZR3 with a Leica lens and a bit bigger grip.  It is still small like this camera, but I'm hoping the Leica lens will focus to a bit clearer photos on zoom.  I may shoot it at a reduced MP size of 10 or 12 since 14MP is a bit much for the sensors on these cameras.  If the Leica lens in the ZR3 still has focus problems on the far end of 8x zoom like this one does, I will go for an older TZ5 or TZ4.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera....", "Author": "David Marks \"norcalidave\"", "ReviewID": "R3W27SU54OI0MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the FH20 for three months and it is simply an awesome camera...and at $149 now (on Amazon), with free shippingand no tax, it is both awesome AND incredible.

It's almost impossible to talk to someone by phone, as it's always busy, and they don't respond emails. After 1 week insisting on the phone, I was finally able to talk to someone, and she lied on my face saying that the charger sent back was exactly the same one I originally sent. When I started insisting it's not fair I pay for their mistake, she hand up the phone on me. With no resources and no one else to complain, I ended up having to buy another charger.My wish was to get rid of this camera just because I don't ever want to deal with Panasonic again.

I have been using the FH20K for about 6 weeks and am very pleased with it.I got this camera for a trip to Vietnam and took many great shots and video indoors, outdoors, in sunny and rainy weather and even some nice video at night.  The video capability greatly exceeded my expectaions - it looks great when layed back on a pc or tv, and the audio is pretty god considering that it uses an internal mic located at the top of the camera.  Battery life is very good.  I did not count how many pix and videos I took or how much time I spent on playback, but I only charged it twice in two weeks.  The battery charges in an external charger that folds very small and is easy to pack in a small space.  It uses a battery pack (brick), which is expected for a camera this size.  I think its a good idea to get a second battery if you plan to use it for long periods without access to an eletrical outlet.Now the negatives - it suffers from the same things point and shoots suffer from.  It is not great in low light and there is some lag.  These are minor issues when you consider the cameras size, weight, convenience and price.I recommend this camera and would buy it again.PS I keep reading that point and shoots are becoming obsolete because of cameras built into phones.  I don't see the same level of quality in the phones for a few more years, but my concern is that this thinking and dynamic may cause manufacturers to reduce the number of point and shoot models available in the not so distant future.

The video is decent enough.  For $150 I don't expect miracles, but this is an all around decent performer.The menu system is not perfectly intuitive, but it is simple and easily learned.  It reminds me a little bit of the basic menu system on low end cell phones-- sometimes what you want to do is cumbersome or requires jumping around between menus, but it is all there.  For example, a physical switch toggles between \"playing\" your picture or video on the screen or being in record mode.  That gets awkward when you are trying to check what you've already snapped or recorded while you are in the middle of a picture taking session, but it does the job.

The excellent optical zoom in particular is a great feature. The large touchscreen makes for beautiful image previews, but is a little less responsive than a typical button-based interface when zooming/panning/inspecting pictures in camera memory. For this reason, if you're choosing between a FH22 and FH20 and really like reviewing your pictures right after you've taken them, I'd suggest the FH20 (same exact camera but no touchscreen).However, I'm not sure I can really recommend either of those cameras, or even Panasonic as a company from which to buy a digital camera.I recently dropped my FH22 from a height of 3 feet onto a tile floor, which caused the CCD (image sensor) to stop working. I suspect that the CCD somehow got loose inside the camera from the fall, as everything about the camera works except for the fact that it appears to be taking a picture of pitch black no matter where I point it. While it may have just been one unlucky bounce (always take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt), I've owned a few point-and-shoots before this FH22 and was truly surprised that such a trivial fall could harm the camera in that way. It's possible that Panasonic just doesn't make cameras as reliable or durable as previous brands I've owned (Canon and Kodak, dropped many, many times).Even if this malfunction was just an isolated freak accident, one thing that's for sure broken is Panasonic's service/repair procedure. I sent my camera in to an official Panasonic repair center and was quoted a price of $60 over the phone. A week later, I received an invoice for $128.25. Seeing as how I bought the camera brand new for $200 (you may be able to get it even cheaper by now), that price seemed a little steep. I called Panasonic up again and they explained that they don't repair cameras, they only ever replace them with refurbished models. They claimed they weren't sure what the earlier $60 quote was about.Other minor service gripes:1. When asking about the $128.25, tried calling the specific Panasonic service center I sent my camera to (using a phone number that they supplied me) 3 times a day for an entire week, and never got through. Eventually had to call up Panasonic's main number in order to hear the bad news.2. My invoice actually had $61.98 originally printed on it. Somebody used whiteout and a blue pen to write in $128.25 (you can see through the whiteout with minimal effort). Shady shady.So in conclusion, while I take full responsibility for dropping my camera I simply cannot recommend Panasonic cameras as a brand to buy.tl;dr: When it works, it's great.

Much of my prior disappointment can be chocked up my over eager use of the camera modes. I have found that rather than touching the photo settings, its better just to use the default auto white balance setting.As a result of taking pictures using the auto white-balance setting, I was quite happy with the picture quality.  That said, I would change my previous comment that I would purchase a Canon if I had to buy a camera again--this camera is quite good for the price.(original review)I got this camera for a few trips that I am taking after my graduation.  My two biggest concerns were price and picture quality--I don't  need anything fancy.  As an alternative, I was looking at was the Canon SD series.While I didn't care about the 14 MP  sized pictures, I decided on this camera mainly for the optic zoom.Thus far, the camera has been somewhat of a disappointment (see update). The camera performed only so-so on a camping trip and at a college graduation. Specifically, I found that the outdoor pictures were overly blue, and I found that the indoor pictures tend to be overly yellow. The flash is strong enough to illuminate a person in a dim room, but at the cost of washing out the picture.What makes things worse, is the noise and artifacting that is visible in some pictures. This is likely due to the small sensor in the camera and the absurdly large picture size of 14 MP. To reduce this I turned the picture size to only 10 MP.I also don't care for the aesthetics of the camera itself. The front of the camera is nicely made with brushed aluminum, whereas the back is made of plastic. The back also juts out of the camera by a 1/4\", which makes it feel odd.Compared to my partner's 5 year old Sony camera, which was purchased for about $200 at the time, this camera takes pictures of lesser quality.

I must say, I have not been disappointed. Although I've had a couple fuzzy pictures (probably due to ME moving rather than the object being photographed), most of the shots have been fantastic. In particular, the camera was able to clearly capture individual water droplets in a swimming photo and a roller coaster in mid-drop. I also like the fact that you can select a mode (say, Sports) and the camera remembers it. Then when you press the IA button, it switches between the mode you've selected and IA, making switching mode quick and easy. My only suggestion to Panasonic would be for then to develop a camera case specific for this product, as I had to do a bit of legwork to find one I liked.

Battery, charger, usb cable, and so forth. Nothing missing that you'd expect to get.Build Quality:The camera feels solid and sturdy in the hand. As with all cameras, it probably would not survive a large drop, but it is solidly built, so no worries about putting it in a backpack or purse.Picture Quality:The camera takes great pictures. It is as simply as point and shoot for most environments. I don't know much about settings and so forth, and the iAuto mode does me well. I can leave it on the automatic mode and take beautiful pictures in most environments. Occasionally, I'll have to switch modes, particularly in very low light conditions. In these cases, it continues to take great pictures at low light levels, once I pick a low light picture mode. The camera powers on and responds quickly. It fulfills my expectations when it comes to being able to take quick shots.Ease of Use:The menu system for picking picture modes could use some work. It is a bit troublesome to change modes. Instead of a dial as many other cameras use, the picture mode selection is done through pushing buttons and clicking through menus. Other than that, the camera is easy to use and pretty intuitive. If I can do it, you can too. The battery lasts for a very reasonable number of shots.

I need two batteries...always need a spare so that while I'm out, when the battery dies, I can continue shooting pictures. Sadly, Panasonic has crippled their cameras against use of any non-Panasonic battery, and THEY DO NOT SELL A BATTERY FOR THIS CAMERA (as of 7/28/10).So, this very fine camera must go back to the store and gets a one-star rating from me. Very, very sad.If you're interested in this camera and don't need a spare battery, buy it! If by now (whenever you are reading this review) Panasonic has a battery available, consider this a four-star review!REVISED TO ADD: I spent about an hour looking for a second battery for this camera and learned about how Panasonic built programming into the camera to lock out all non-Panasonic batteries. I searched the Panasonic battery site and found no replacement for the CGA-S/106B battery that came with the camera, so I called Panasonic Customer Support. I spent fifteen minutes with them, during which time they informed me very explicitly that A) they did not have a replacement CGA-S/106B battery to sell me, and B) there was no other battery that would work. I told them that this meant I had to return the camera, and they had no comment. I wrote the above review.Before I could return the camera, the comments below came in, and further research turned up a review that I can't find now, vouching for the DMW-BCF 10PP battery for use in the Lumix DMC-FH20. I bought one of these batteries, charged it overnight, and this morning it does indeed appear to work in my camera.At this point, the most I can offer is a Tom Slick \"Yay\" (if you ever saw the cartoon, you get the reference). It's a non-celebratory kind of \"yay\" composed of 10% jubiliation and 90% weariness.The camera itself gets three stars. There's an inherent problem with Lumix cameras involving the lens arrangement and a persistent message to turn the camera off and then on again. When this problem gets severe, you need to send the camera in for repair which, if you use Panasonic service, costs more than the cost of this camera. And that proprietary battery nonsense is just pure greed.But it takes great pictures and is easy to use, so those aspects get four and five stars.Tech support drags down the average by getting one star, which is one more than they deserve.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "lemon(s)", "Author": "Deborah L.

It is unacceptable to me and I almost prefer to use my older 5MP camera which doesn't seem to have this problem so much. The same problem occurred to a slightly lesser extent when I took pictures outside on a semi-cloudy day. HD Video has the same graininess in the same light conditions. I suspect this problem is caused either by a less than adequate lens or the jpeg compression. By the way, you cannot select what quality picture you want. The camera uses who knows what compression level and saves everything as jpeg. You can only select from different picture sizes.Another shortcoming of this camera is the build quality. The battery door is made of a flimsy plastic that can easily break if you are not careful while it is open. I also don't like the shape of the edges of the camera. They are rounded in such a way that the camera feels like it will slip out of my hands.The only plus side I found with this camera was the relative speed of the shoot cycle. I think it is something like 1 or 1.5 seconds between pictures, and it feels peppy. Not sure about the claims of a fast shutter. I was using the \"intelligent\" auto setting and there were times when the picture had some blur around my subject who was moving around slowly.For what it's worth, I was also testing the Olympus Stylus Tough 6000 and it had performed better in the same low light conditions. There was still some graininess, but it was much more palatable to me. Main drawback of the Olympus is the long cycle time.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "DPS11", "ReviewID": "RZY69W6M9NGEN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing this camera and felt it was one of my best options for the price.  My previous Cannon Powershot had been dropped and broken and, though nothing was wrong with it, our Kodak EasyShare was just too bulky.  I read plenty of reviews and am surprised that so many people have been happy with the Lumix.  I've tried nearly all of the settings and have consistently ended up with semi-blurry photos, none of which have clear or crisp color quality.  Several of the settings that are supposed to be \"easy\" require you to hold the button down halfway until the focus boxes appear prior to holding the button down completely to take a picture.  This is supposed to keep the photos from being blurry and although it does help somewhat the photos are not crisp at all.  This isn't exactly ideal when asking others to take a picture for you either.  I just used the \"intelligentAuto\" setting on a weekend trip and upon my return was extremely disappointed to upload my photos and find every single one to be washed out in color and completely out of focus, both of which were hard to tell on the camer's playback screen.  My main purpose for the camera is capturing moments with friends and family and, unfortunately, the past few months are now blurry.

It takes just as high resolution photos as my Canon and the Auto AI is remarkably adept at adjusting the scene settings, so I stopped bothering trying to set that myself. You can even get it to produce some DOF effects with a little practice. Its main weakness is indoors, where it wants to use the flash all the time. I assume that little lens just isn't fast enough for most indoor use without a flash. Good thing most of my photos from the trip were outdoors anyway!

At first I assumed that having a Mac we would not even need to install the drivers. That assumption was incorrect. So, I went looking for the CD which we had tossed aside in our rush to play with the camera and take pictures. Not finding the CD, I (again) wrongly assumed that in this modern era most every electronic device has drivers for (free) download on their websites. A quick check reveals that Sony does.  Not so with Panasonic. The support page for the DMC-FH20 contains nothing more than the PDF of the Instruction Manual. I could not even find the driver software online under their parts ordering area.  I called Customer Support and after giving my name and model number to four different operators I was transferred to, I was told I had to purchase a new CD.  Hel-LO Panasonic.. the Dark Ages called to say you are behind the times.  I eventually hung up in frustration and disbelief that I would have to buy the silly CD.

I looked at several other brands before purchasing the FH20 based on user reviews. Overall, I am quite satisfied. I didn't give a 5 star rating because nothing is perfect.The camera is solidly constructed and is heavier than most competitors offerings as a result. However, this offers assurance that the camera is not as fragile as those of much of the competition.The output photos are of high quality, much better than what I have seen from the cameras of several other manufacturers. This comparison, in some cases, is not only to compact cameras but to larger, higher priced, digital point and shoot cameras. The exception to the good quality is when the digital zoom feature is used.The 8x optical zoom of the FH20 exceeds that offered by other manufacturers that I looked at by 2x. Photos taken using this feature are of very good quality and compare favorably with those produced by many larger, more costly, point and shoot digital cameras.The FH20 biggest negative is inherent to all cameras of this type; the LCD viewfinder. Using this type of viewfinder is awkward because the camera must be held away from the eye which sometimes makes it difficult to determine the focus point. Also, the image is difficult to see in bright sunlight or areas of strong illumination.The digital zoom feature is off by default. This is a good thing because I found that using it does not produce any usable photos.This is a very good compact camera, one that I would recomend to others in the market for a camera of this type. I did, in fact, tell my wife we needed to buy one for her use. However, I would only recommend it as a supplemental camera due primarily to the reliance on the LCD screen as a viewfinder.

Under low level lighting with full zoom, the picture quality gets grainy and the video mode needs a Class 6 or better memory card.  Low level lighting in general is a challenge for the camera.  Controls are fairly intuitive, LCD screen is big and bright.  The camera, for what it is worth, is a great camera and could rival those that are much more expensive.  For a simple point-and-shoot fit-in-the-pocket camera, this gets an A+.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "aurelius101", "ReviewID": "R9EVZ4KVEGGM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our Fuji Finepix 3600 finally bit the dust after 6 years of very good service.

My wife can even take good pictures with this camera, previously all of hers were blurry now they are sharp. Our dogs wagging tail is clear instead of blurry (It is seldom still). It took excellent pictures in bright sunlight and dark interior. It seems well made, not cheap. It did not come with a photo card so be sure to order one. I did not know there were different classes within the cards. other reviews and the instructions say if you plan to take videos you need at least a class 6 SD card. We have one ordered.

I find all of these point and shoots excel in bright sunlight (don't all cameras). While you can get a decent picture indoors, you should set your expectations as moderate in that endeavor. Indoor lighting is more than opening a blind on one side, turning on the dining room chandelier (because it is annoyingly bright) and turning on an incandescent or cfl bulbed lamp in the corner and thinking you have achieved some proper lighting scenario. Lighting is complex at best and most indoor lighting sux for photography, plus you are using a stock lens. I mean do you really think at this price point all your pics are gonna look great? Well only in direct sunlight maybe.The video is touted as 720p and while I don't know about that, I will say that I am very impressed with the detail and clarity achieved in outdoor shoots. I stuck a class 6 card in there as suggested in the owners manual (even though a regular SD card seemed to work) and it is very smooth. I can rapid fire still shots as the data writes very quickly to the card. The feature set is rich and the menu friendly and intuitive.

I used this camera for all kinds of adventures from taking pictures around the ranch, to hiking, and out in weather that it is not made for.

And that was that the lens protector will not open all the way anymore and cuts off part of your photos or will focus on the part hanging in the way and not on you subject.  This is frustrating as you always have to check to make sure it has opened all the way and then your shot is gone. And even when you push them out of the way they get in the way.

Since it was gift shopping time I figured I will up myself to a 14MP, in case I need to blow up any pictures to larger size.I am not much into customizing any settings (that is why a point n shoot) - takes too much time when you need to click NOW, especially when there is technology which can figure that out for you. I guess you get what you pay for.In general I am ok with this point and shoot as long as you do that in broad daylight on a bright and sunny day. Low light conditions and night on auto mode are really bad, and almost all pictures with low light have been very disappointing.

The Panasonic comes pretty close in all aspects and even surpasses the FinePix in a few.  Before buying this camera I did a side by side with the FinePix and my mom's Nikon CoolPix (not sure what model, towards the lower end of the line though), and the photos from the CoolPix lacked the depth and definition of the FinePix.Based on the test shots, here is what I think:-Great indoor photos with and without flash.-Flash shots do not look anywhere near as bad as flash photos usually look to me.-Vivid, saturated colors, almost in the realm of too warm, esp. in comparison to the FinePix which looked washed out in comparison.-Quite a zoom for a compact camera-Photos had more depth and detail than what I got on my mom's CoolPix, but they were just shy of the sharpness of the FinePix-Auto Intelligent feature seems quite accurate, although it always uses flash inside, and I tend to turn my flash off unless I absolutely need it.I like the construction of the body, it feels very solid, and although it is a little bit bigger than I wanted for my small camera, the quality of the photos is so high that I do not mind at all.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Jack of All Trades", "Author": "Antonio", "ReviewID": "R2CAF8NMZV5R6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a broken Kodak.

The one thing that the Kodak really did better was video recording. Although I prefer the Panasonic's video format, the Kodak allowed you to zoom while recording and the Panasonic doesn't. Also, Kodak recorded from two mic's, allowing for stereo sound; the Panasonic doesn't. But for casual recording, the Panasonic is more than adequate, especially when you consider the HD recording quality.

For the money this is an excellent camera - it has a super zoom which allows you to photograph things from far away, which will be great for my stepsister taking photos of her horses in the pasture, and it is absolutely tiny, which is great for my brother as he likes to stuff everything (ipod, books, you name it) into the pockets of his cargo pants. It takes wonderful photos and makes it really easy to grab a quick home movie on the fly. The controls are nicely balanced, if you just want to get a snapshot without thinking about it too hard it is easy to use in idiot mode, and if you want to have more input into what your picture looks like there are plenty of serious-photographer options for you to choose from, although there is no manual focus. And it comes in variety of fun colours - I chose a red one for my stepsister and a black one for my brother.Unlike my older Lumix - a DMC TZ3 - this one does not come with a Leica lens, it has an 8x optical zoom rather than a 10x optical zoom, and it is manufactured in China rather than Japan. But then again it costs less than half the price I paid for my old DMC TZ3, and it is about half the size. If you want a Leica-lensed more serious Lumix you can still buy one, they make new models with the Leica lens, loads more options and a price to match - this one, the DMC ZS7 looks pretty awesome: Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black).

Didn't last long, though.", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R30GL49DVOKBKS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift from my parents about a year and a half ago.  I needed something to replace my old Kodak EasyShare DX7630, a bulky, 6MP, 3x zoom camera I got back in 2005 that still works with the exception of the menu navigation system, which made the camera a pain to use since I couldn't go back and delete pictures to free up space on my card.My first impressions of the FH20 were that the camera fit nicely in my pocket and the menu was fairly easy to figure out, but the battery cover was very flimsy and much too easy to accidentally open.  In fact, only about a day after I got it, I dropped the camera on my carpet and the battery cover snapped off-- not at the hinges, but right through the plastic next to the hinge.  I fixed it with super glue and all was well, but since then pieces of the battery cover have flaked off through normal in-and-out-of-pocket use.  That's disappointing.What I do like about the construction is the On/Off and Camera/Review switches.  They are very simple and easy to use and I got used to them very quickly.  I also like the panel covering the USB connection-- the cover here is actually sturdy (doesn't open unless you want it to) and aesthetically appealing.Now on to image quality.  I am by no means a photographer, nor do I speak photgraphese or own a DSLR or anything.  I am a college student, and I enjoy bringing back quality photos of scenery from my travels.  I took my old Kodak to Luxembourg in 2010, and I took my FH20 to Greece in 2011.  Not caring much for making large prints but rather images I could display on my 22\" monitor, I kept my Kodak photo resolution to 3.1MP.  When I got my FH20, I set it to 3MP because I liked the resolution and could fit a large number of photos on my 2gb card (the largest size my kodak would read).  What I found was kind of disappointing, however.  Even though they were nearly the same size photos, my old Kodak produced photos of better quality-- I found that the FH20 photos were less sharp in comparison.  The FH20 didn't perform as well in low lighting as the Kodak did, either, but it -did- do better than the Kodak in bright, natural light, producing accurately colored, highly detailed photos.  I did bump up the resolution to 12MP to test it out, but I could still see the same lack of sharpness in the images that I had enjoyed in my Kodak's photos.Now some more bad stuff.  I noticed quickly that the FH20 had some distortion near the edges of its photos-- that fish eye-like effect that elongates subjects near the corners of photographs.  This didn't happen with my Kodak, and I was upset to see it in the FH20.  About 8 months into owning the FH20, the camera started to be unable to focus on objects when zoomed in, no matter how close or far the subject.  I would have to focus zoomed entirely out, then zoom in slowly and refocus after each zoom.  Then about 10 months in, some dust or something got between the lens and I perpetually had a dark spot in the upper right center of my photos, which drove me mad because I was on the beautiful coast of Maine.  Then the lens cover started to get stuck and wouldn't retract fully when the lens was extended.  Finally, after a year, the lens started not extending when turned on, and I would have to try a few times to get it to work.  Within a month, however, the lens would not extend at all, rendering the camera useless.  I tried some more common, do-it-yourself fixes, but none of them worked.  I considered sending it in to Panasonic anyway, but after reading about their pretty awful customer service in regards to fixing things like this (and the amount I'd have to pay), I decided against it.
