The eyes of people taken with flash show white dots. The camera was returned unrepaired with the advice to stop taking pictures with flash. I spent $350 for this camera and now it should go to the garbage.

Hard to find champange color I looked everywhere for and it does not disappoint! Pleased with all aspects, used the heck out of this little guy on my cruise. Only one negative, the battery life not so great. And it is easy to turn on by accident, therefore it is \"on\" and you do not know it, and the batteries are being used up.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great wide angle view", "Author": "J. Howard", "ReviewID": "R22N6OW4B3JTFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect for my business.  I sell RVs and needed a easy to use, wide angle lens, so that you can see more of the interior of the RV for our Web-listings.  The Shots that I take outside, of the exteriors, are not as good, but would be perfect for wide shots or scenic views.  I will probably just use this one for interiors and my other point and shoot camera, with a regular lens, for exterior shots of the RVs.  It has a nice wide screen and the touch screen works OK, not as sensitive as my iphone, but that might be a good thing.  I think this camera would be great for a Real Estate person or appraiser too, who is trying to get the most out of a photo of an interior room.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazed by motion pics", "Author": "P. Middleton", "ReviewID": "R1CF322F3LQDY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had my camera about a month, but am so far extremely pleased.  I was totally amazed when I took a photo of a flowering plant that was blowing in the breeze giving it a back and forth arc of about 2 inches of movement.  The photo turned out very clear with no blurring at all.  I took the pic while testing the camera and did not expect this result.  Definitely a 5 star or even better, in my opinion.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "BenAdonai", "ReviewID": "R3B229YWCP6RRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without getting into all the tech details about this camera, I just want to say it is perfect for my grip, wonderful panoramic viewing screen, and just what I wanted!

The battery life was pretty poor - I would hate to take it on vacation and miss half day's shots every day because the battery didn't last.
