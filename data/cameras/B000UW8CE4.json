I upgraded from the Stylus 810 which was an outstanding camera. If you are a professional  photographer or like to adjust your own aperature or speed setting then this is not for you. If you are like most of the people who will buy this camera I find it difficult to beat.  You can carry it easily in a shirt pocket or a purse. The 8 MP is more than enough for most point and shoot cameras.  The dual stabilization makes it hard to create any picture with a blur. This is almost a must for zoom pictures and perhaps the best stabilization of any of  the many cameras I have tried. It offers a close up setting and a micro close up setting. It offers 4 settings for the  quality of the picture you will take (pixels).  If you want a picture for ebay use the low setting with close up feature. If you want a picture of your family go for the high setting. It has to many presets to mention for such things as action, people, night scenes, etc. The camera is simplicity at its best. Even a novice  should be taking pictures a few minutes  out of the box. Set the built in flash to auto and forget it if you want to. All  controls are clear and easy to use. If it is  raining do not worry as this camera has  a  weather tight case.  I have used the professional Nikon,s etc but for most of you this camera is all you will  ever  want and  more. I highly recommend this camera. Two caveats and that is to buy a 1G or 2G memory card as the camera does not come with a card. Also buy an extra battery so you will always have an extra charged battery available if you take a lot of pictures. I also recommed the soft carrying case made by Olympus. I give this camera 5 stars.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice product but pricey", "Author": "E \"T\"", "ReviewID": "RYF6HOP35TH9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the features, especially the image stabilization.  You have to love the stabilization or you should buy the 820 for a lot less $$.  I played with the 820 at Best Buy and the 830 will take a sharper picture, especially on full zoom.  The downside is that the camera uses up battery power rather quickly so you may want to purchase a spare battery.  The camera does not come with a memory card at all so plan on getting one, and a case is a good idea too.  If I could do it again, I would probably buy a blue one instead of the basic chrome.Olympus Stylus 820 8MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom (Silver)Olympus Stylus 830 8MP Digital Camera with Dual Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom (Blue)", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "teacher101 \"Avid reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2L9KMMVTO6ATR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera in the mail yesterday and I love it.

So if you are a novice and aren't technology minded, this is not for you.  If you have a lot of digital camera experience and want to take the time to go to different shooting options, then you'll do fine with this.  I'm middle of the road but feel like I'd do better if I took a photography class to help me better.The biggest things I was looking for in a new camera (had a Canon Elph)was for red eye to work (it does most of the time), picture color was acurate (this seems to be) and with small children that I be able to click and it gets the picture when I took it...not after they've turned their head etc.  This is what I'm disappointed in.  I'm playing around some with Portrait, Sports, etc and it's helping some, but I was used to turning on my camera and immediately take a kid picture...not have to push more buttons and even then it doesn't take the picture as fast as my Canon did.We were also out Christmas Eve looking at lights and most of them kept coming out blurry and that was with stabilization on.  And I was playing with the different night features to see if any made a difference.  Thankfully, I don't need to take many outside dark pictures for this to be a major issue.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus 830", "Author": "Natalie Chronister", "ReviewID": "R3SKCDV4T3FX65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Olympus Stylus 830 8MP Digital Camera with Dual Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom (Black) I bought this for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!

I read the instructions to expand my knowledge but the functions were pretty intuitive.  Some other reviews have mentioned that the battery doesn't last long, but I haven't experienced that problem.  I've used the camera on several occasions and have not yet re-charged the battery.  The only thing I have to get used to is the zoom button.  My previous camera was a Canon Powershot, which had an easier zoom function.  But that is just a small adjustment.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointing", "Author": "littledogsden", "ReviewID": "RDZERBBEQ25QM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, let me say that I am a completely casual camera user. By no means do I have high expectations. I bought this camera because I work with dogs and I like to take pictures of them for my website. Dogs, as you may know, are very difficult to photograph because they cannot stay still unless they are pretty much sleeping (kids, and other living things, can be the same) and most pictures come out blurry (unless you use the flash, which distorts colors and causes redeye).With my former digital camera, a 2002 Fujifilm Finepix, all my photos were either (A) very blurry, unusable pictures of dogs doing interesting things (B) less blurry pictures of dogs sleeping-or close to sleeping (C) clear, but flash-distorted and red-eyed pictures of dogs in action.This was getting very boring, so I began the search for a camera with anti-blur (sans flash) options. The Olympus 830 got great (too good to be true) reviews, had anti-camera shake options and boasted high ISO for capturing objects in motion. I spent weeks searching, and I couldn't find a camera with better reviews and such a seemingly high probablity of great, blur free photos.Well, I ordered it, and here's what I found.-If you set the ISO to 800 or higher, you will most likely get a blur-free photo, even if the subject is moving.-HOWEVER any ISO setting above 100 will distort dark colors with horrendous noise (pinks and purples, oranges and blues... awful! I will post examples). I didn't know what noise WAS before I got this camera!-If you set the ISO to anything less than 200 and you are photographing anything other than inanimate objects like statues and chairs, you WILL 90% of the time get a blurry photo, even with all the anti-shake, anti-blur settings turned on.Basically, it's possible to get a blur free photo with this camera, but the tradeoff if you get a terribly colored photo with ill-defined lines and an overall image quality that's worse than the cheapest cameras on the market. Why didn't anybody mention this in the reviews? It's very noticeably bad. You don't need to be anything close to an expert to pick up on it.I guess the camera takes good macro shots. If you're looking to take lots of pictures of flowers really close up, it might be a good camera. If you want to take a picture of anything that moves, look elsewhere.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "PlateMan4400 \"Travelman\"", "ReviewID": "RADSQN52SZ1L0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am by no means a tech expert, but this camera is amazing.

I must admit I am wondering if my delemer is because it is a point and shoot and I am asking to much, My latest cameras are Olympus E-510 and E-3. I wanted something small to carry with me when a bigger camera would cause concern. I love the Macro on this camera (830), as always Olympus has the best macro on the market, as far as I am concerned, the 4/3rds is the reason. I however didn't like the over all long shooting with the X5 zoom, I found it a bit grainy. If you don't use the x5 it was not grainy almost a given I guess with a point and shoot any one jump in here, I'm not totally sure.  Over all if your looking for a small point and shot, that takes really good close ups or macro this is the camera.  If your looking for a camera to shot like an slr over all, even though it may have a lot of the same settings, this camera may disappoint you.

I have larger ones but they always seem to end up staying home because nobody (including me) wants to carry them around and I was really nervous that this was going to be another crappy camera, I already gave my nieces and nephews the old crappy ones to play with.  But after I started to use this it was very easy to operate and to find your way around thru it's options - The camera is small and easy to carry around in your pocket or purse.  The Zoom is good as well and when printing it is very clear I was really surprised at how clear. The only thing I have bad to say is the night shots no matter how you set them in the camera don't come out clear. and the camera resets itself when you turn it off, and that can be a pain sometimes. but all in all I am very pleased and glad that I took the chance and bought this camera, it is a very good non-professional camera", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Cam", "Author": "C.

I ave shot with a small canon powershot for years.  I started in manual 35 mm.  This camera is great.  I was happy for years with the photo quality of my Canon , as well with their software and support.  It was an early model and slow.  I am learning my big Nikon D80 and for its money i am sure it can do loads of brilliant things,  still not terribly active with it and disappointed in Nikons Web support and image quality sometimes.  As i said it may be i haven't unlocked its potential but small reservations along with reviews led me to be suspect of going with Nikon on my new compact digital.  A friend suggested olympus, i saw some of her photos from a very basic and older model and the color was amazing...stil hesitant to go with a manufacture i never handled, the reviews seemed positive and the photos i had seen were proof.  I bought this model and almost everything is perfect.  -It SHoots very large format photos for later processing.-Adjusts quickly,-the flash photograpy retains the color you were looking for in the first place- preset modes, menus and choices are fully functional and usable as tools.-enough manual adjustment and preview mode to real have some flexibility in creating the right look in the photo.-menu was easy to learn-though i have photoshop, its own software program seems very straight forward and functional.-movie mode-panorama-they don't really explain enough about it various features and settings in the product description.Cons are: it only has the digital viewer, no physical view finder.  ie you find yourself shading it in bright light to see what you are trying to photo. not a problem for me though, everything else is too nice-as well they use the their own media type exclusive to Olympus.
