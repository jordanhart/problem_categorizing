I've been wanting a waterproof camera for years, and decided to finally take the plunge.  As soon as it arrived, I took quite a few pictures, both indoors and out.  They are all very low quality.  12mp? Please.  My cellphone takes way higher quality pictures than this little \"gem\".  Camera is also very small - makes the button placement awkward.  Also, the buttons and their functions are no where near an intuitive as a regular camera.Returning this ASAP.  I will stick with a well known brand next time!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont let the 12 megapixel fool you", "Author": "HENRY LUONG", "ReviewID": "R3IZ6CT7X44BPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "12 Megapixels sure, but be forewarned the images comes out like gif images rather than JPG images.
