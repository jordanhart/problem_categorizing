{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice camera for the money", "Author": "P. Elosser", "ReviewID": "R343JTF2WN6Q66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth or fifth Canon digital P&S;, over the years I've worn all the others out. This one has lived up to my expectations of Canon quality. All the controls do take a bit of experimentation to figure out, but you can leave it on AUTO and let the camera do all the work. The only disadvantage for me, there is no manual control of shutter speed and F-stop. However, in P mode you can index the exposure (+/-) and set the ISO speed for some creativity. The pre-programed modes have a good variety and they all basically work giving you the desired effects. Image quality is excellent IMHO for any P&S; camera in this price range. There is almost no difference in image quality between ISO 100 and 200. ISO 400 begins to show a tiny bit of noise or artifacts. ISO 800 and 1600 do show some noise but it looks to me like the camera automatically despeckles the picture, which eliminates most of the noise but noticeably softens the focus. Close focus mode works accurately. A couple of hints: First, set the camera to ISO 100 (rather than AUTO ISO) and you will get great pictures in most lighting conditions. Second, learn to use the white balance for the appriate lighting conditions (sunlight, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) Although the auto white balance works, it often won't work as well as setting it for the proper balance. Also, learn to set the flash functions. You often don't need flash to get a great picture and with the flash off you'll save battery charge. You can certainly preview your pictures to get the best results. Need to get that quick picture with no time to set the adjustments? Just hit the AUTO button!Strengths:Very small and compact, fits in shirt pocket when turned off.Excellent image quality with very adequate zoom range.Large easy to see LCD screen.Easy to use AUTO-mode with plenty of pre-defined creative modes.Rechargeable Lithium Ion battery.Camera can be set for personal preferences, like sound volume and LCD brightness.Rapid downloading of pictures to your computer.Weaknesses:No optical view finder.Controls are small and a bit cramped.Zoom control is in an awkward position.No case or SD card included.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great features. Image quality is lacking.", "Author": "Leon", "ReviewID": "R1GGSIUHGUUKTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace a PowerShot SD780 IS ELPH that I have had for 3 years. The A4000 has decent reviews on other sites, so I bit. I wish I would have paid more and bought another Canon SD/ELPH.One thing the A4000 only takes 720p video at 25fps. My old SD780 did at 30fps.For my review, I am almost directly comparing the A4000 to my old SD780 which is 3 years old.A4000 Pros:1) Taking video with the steadyshot works very well.2) Miniature effect and other modes are fun3) Takes fast photos4) Zoom is phenomenal. 8x optical + 4x digital.5) View screen is large and sharp6) Construction feels really solidA4000 Cons:1) Video seems choppy and heavily compressed (blocky) compared to the SD7802) 720p is only at 25fps when most other models are 30fps3) Photos don't seem as sharp as the SD7804) Sound recording quality isn't as clear as the SD780", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Tom G", "ReviewID": "RLJBDNOZ78CUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The little camera is a charmer. The picture quality is color perfect. Has a big LCD display. The response time of the controls and zoom are very snappy. It has 8x optical zoom and if you keep your finger on the zoom it continues after a slight warning pause onto digital zoom for 32x. Yeah, the pic will get a bit grainy at that level but you've got lots of pixels to work with. What I really like is the light weight and it fits into my shirt pocket. Or, get the Case Logic case and snug it into your pants pocket or a purse. It's so light, you will actually take this one with you and use it. The price is great for the quality and I love the blue color. Yes, the purist will say there are compromises with a super small camera like this but it's not a concern for the average person taking snapshots and the occasional movie. I've had larger Canons but I like this one the best because it's usable and has plenty of features. Macro photography (closeups) is automatic and really easy. Canon did a great job on this camera.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Little Camera with Big Features", "Author": "K. Duncan", "ReviewID": "R3BGK9QHOZFK6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When my pocket Sony camera died, I thought I wanted a little bigger camera with more features, but friends with bigger, \"real\" cameras convinced me to look for another pocket-sized camera for ease of carrying.  I compared at a lot of cameras in this \"class\" and am very happy with my decision to go with this Canon PowerShot.First, for such a little camera, it has so many cool features that I've had a hard time remembering they are all available, including many features that before now were only available in photo editing software such as fisheye and monochrome.  I will be honest that it's unlikely that I'll be able to use features like this \"on the fly\" for quick shots of the kids.  But if you are setting up a nice shot, it's fun to run through these features to see what you can get.  Probably the nicest thing is that even with a whole slew of manual modes available, it has a very nice and effective fully automatic mode which pretty much fixes any shot so it's good.  The automatic mode does create a bit of a lag in the time to take the photo, but the results are worth it.Second, the zoom quality is awesome. It has 8x optical zoom, then up to 30x digital zoom.  While playing with it around my house, I was amazed at the clear, close up shots I was able to get of small items on a dresser 18 feet away and even further shots of items BEHIND ME taken in the mirror of the dresser!The controls are easy use and fairly intuitive.  Getting to some of the features has taken a little getting used to since some of them are layered and I could not remember how to find them again, but after a while it all makes sense.  My old Sony had a touch screen, but I don't miss it at all.  Having actual buttons has been a nice change with being able to feel the buttons as well as see them.  Also, seeing the photos that have been taken is MUCH eaiser than on the touch screen which required moving from photo taking mode to viewing mode, then back to photo taking mode to continue.  THis Canon has a simple button that takes you right to viewing mode and back.  No multiple steps necessary.I've given it 4 stars rather than 5 only because I had a hard time finding features.  The manual could be more complete with regard to exactly how to USE some of these cool features and how to get to them, rather than just listing that they are there.Over all, I've been very happy with this camera and would recommend it whole heartedly.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Takes good pics but NO optical zoom in movie mode", "Author": "guy", "ReviewID": "R3CDMFPO626NH0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good solid camera, high quality built and looks, nice LCD screen and easy user-friendly functions.  Takes good pics and records HD movies.....only one problem, HD movie mode DOES NOT HAVE Optical Zoom.  Which means, if you do zoom (digital zoom) while making HD movies, it'll start blurring.  So that's the only big downside, other than than...it's a great camera, just not a good camcorder.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "3ddraft", "ReviewID": "R7E3TF4DX8P46", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera actually for work so that we would have a camera to keep in the job truck.  The boss used it first time out and he's not one to pick up technology easily so when he had no complaints on the camera, I knew it was a good buy.  The pictures turned out great even in the shade under the roof.  There is some noticeable camera shake in shady pictures but nothing that couldn't be overcome with some more use and practice.The only major thing I have against this is that in pictures lit by full sun, there is noticeable vignetting.  I notice it since my other camera is a DSLR but for the typical user of this camera, it's not a big deal.  Just be sure to leave some space around your subject so that it doesn't detract when you're processing the pictures.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful, until it wasn't", "Author": "Second Wind", "ReviewID": "R2LXIBXJ9UVR0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was very happy with this camera, it was exactly what I expected, exactly as advertised and I have taken well over 1000 photos with it.  Of a sudden, for no apparent reason, it developed a fine line that runs vertically through every image, dividing the image exactly in half.  This is clearly not a lens scratch or other bump or drop type of damage, this is some electronic gremlin that decided to pay a visit and won't go away.Unfortunately, my return window is closed and I am sending it off to Canon today in the hopes of getting the camera back functioning as it was 3 months ago.Keep you posted.Update:  Contacted Canon and within a week I had a replacement.  It was refurbished but looks new to me.  Canon could not have been more accomodating and polite. They did not want the accessories returned and so as an added bonus I now have an extra charger and battery.

She likes taking photos of family gatherings and holidays and also of nature and animals.  I use a Canon 7D and she will not take the time to learn how to use it.  I purchased her this camera for Mother's Day and she just loves it.  It is a great point and shoot camera and it does everything she needs it to do.  This camera is extremely powerful and has many features in it.  I put together a video (I am sorry that it is so long) that covers only a few of the key features, such as:* 16 Megapixel camera* Shoots photos and videos* Simple one button access to take a video.* Able to zoom in on a subject in a video* Takes fast and easy photos* 8 times optical zoom and 32 times digital/optical zoom when combined* Small and light weight construction but solidly build* Image stabilization build in to eliminate hand and body motions and allow you to take better photos and videos* Nice 3 inch LCD color display with great resolution and clarity* Records movies in MOV format so my wife can automatically put them into iMovies* Good sound on the movies and very good resolution and video quality* Smart Auto AI that selects one of 32 preset shooting settings to take the right photos based on the conditions the camera sees.  My wife loves this feature.* Very nice AC wall battery charger that has foldable plugs and operates on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz for international use.  Don't forget to take your wall plug adapters.Some weaknesses are:* No optical view finder and you have to use the LCD display in all conditions.* For my big hands the controls are a bit close together* I would have preferred a rocker switch for the zoom control* We had to buy a camera caseWhat my wife liked was the ease of use without having to do a dozen settings to get a reasonable photo.  She was shooting Macro shots of flowers and zooming in on nature shots and animals instantly and having fun doing it.  She wants to take good photos and not have to learn to be a camera expert.  For her she also loved the dark blue color as it reminded her of her beloved Indianapolis Colts.  She finds the autofocus easy to use and she has taken some great photos already.I installed a WIFI SD card and she can transfer the photos and videos to her iPhone and iPad without removing the SD card and she loves that.  I loved that it came with a lanyard as with my huge hands I was afraid that I would drop it all the time.This is good solid camera and we got it at a GREAT price at well under $100 and for that reason alone my wife loved it as she loves a bargain.  She rates it as a 5 star item and she is fascinated with it.  I glad I got it for her.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never met a Canon I didn't like... until now.", "Author": "CTN \"frosty\"", "ReviewID": "R3JS45I90DF4TY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last night.  I'll be returning it tonight or tomorrow.  The picture quality is great and the zoom worked very well. The buttons were slightly hard to use because they were so small, but that's not a major issue for me.My first concern was the ridges on the cover for the lens.  My current powershot is smooth and I carry it in my purse everywhere.  (I have an 8mp camera on my phone but they have nothing on a canon!)  I am afraid to carry this one in my purse because the ridges will catch and open and possibly scratch my lens.My second concern, the main reason I'm returning it, is because it takes so long to take a picture.  I have two kids, 6 & 7, and they don't want to wait 5 seconds while the camera \"thinks\" about it!  It took considerably longer to take multiple shots, also.  My current p&s; is a SD1100IS Elph.  I've carried it around in my purse and my back pocket for a couple years and was planning on passing it on to my mother-in-law when I got this new one.  However, I will keep my 1100 for a while longer until I find something that seems as durable as this one is!If you're using this camera for non-time sensitive shots, I'm sure this is a wonderful camera (I currently have a Rebel T3i, a 5D, the 1100 Elph and my husband has 2 p&s; canons).

So I went all the way up to a Canon EOS Rebel T4i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 18-135mm EF-S IS STM Lens, but I am not going to keep that in my purse!Why miss a great shot simply because I don't have my camera with me? This little cutie will always be with me wherever I go.I could hardly wait for the battery to charge! Being familiar with digital cameras, I figured out the interface within minutes. I ran the camera through all its combinations. Fun! An 8x zoom and all the cool auto settings--including \"toy camera\" and fisheye--are fun to play with.Image stabilization means that I can do hand-held shots in less-than-perfect lighting and get a good image on the first try most of the time. Saves a lot of time when processing images.If you don't plan to read the user manual on CD, you'll be missing out on a lot of great information about the features. IT IS WORTH THE TIME TO LEARN HOW YOUR CAMERA WORKS. Look at the CD. More than once. Until you learn what all the controls do.The battery charger is small -- no cord! :-) The prongs flip out and then back in again. The charger lies flat against the wall when it is in use. There is an indentation so you can use the second electrical socket at the same time.The automatic lens cover is very delicate. Do not quickly lay the camera lens-side down as it is still closing. I got something caught in there, but the camera seemed OK after I opened and closed it a few times to check.I am very pleased with this choice for a \"purse camera.\" When I need a better image, or ability to shoot rapid fire, I'll have the \"big girl\" DSLR.When I use the cable to connect the A4000IS to my Win 7 PC, I get the option of deleting the images off the camera right after they're downloaded to the PC. Saves me a step later. You can also mark certain images as \"protected,\" so that they will not be deleted except when you format the camera's memory card. Maybe take a photo of your contact information, and protect that?The cable also works with my Canon Rebel, so right after I empty one camera, I stick the cable into the other and download off that one as well.UPDATE - JUNE 2, 2013: Within two months, this camera started to lose its ability to focus on something close in bright sunlight. It progressively got worse. The lens cannot focus and the shutter does not fire. The shutter will fire for long-range subjects, but the image is blurry. I did some online research. I'm not the only one who has experienced this.I CAN SEE DUST BEHIND THE FRONT LENS ELEMENT when I go out into natural sunlight and move the camera back and forth to give me some 3D perspective.I contacted Canon via e-mail. The recommended solution is to send in the camera for cleaning. Will this be a permanent fix? Am I better off just returning this camera, and starting all over? I'll be back for an update.UPDATE - JULY 5, 2013: I sent the camera to Canon. As soon as it arrived at their repair shop, they sent me a message by e-mail. Within 24 hours, they wrote back again to tell me that the camera could not be repaired for lack of parts. Really? It's relatively new. They sent me a reconditioned replacement. By FedEx. Faster than I was expecting. So I'm back in business, with only about a week of downtime. I'll watch this new camera for the same problem, but I'm happy to have my little purse camera back again!I appreciated Canon's fast response and their willingness to do what it takes to make me love this camera again. Canon sent a follow-up e-mail to ask how I liked their repair service. I think they are trying hard to make their customers happy.UPDATE - NOVEMBER 20, 2013: I am now on the THIRD camera. And I think that the auto focus is starting to go. Again. I assume that if the problem is a one-time fix, the reconditioned cameras that Canon has been sending me should stay fixed. But they haven't. I probably have time to return it two more times for replacements before the warranty is up. But will I bother? What's the point? I need a purse camera that will last for more than the one-year warranty period. So I have to downgrade my rating from 4 stars to ... two? One? Maybe one is all I can rate this camera. Pitiful. I wanted so badly to love it.UPDATE - JANUARY 14, 2014: I am approaching the end of the one-year warranty. I will return the camera one last time for a replacement. But I will not be able to let it rattle around loose in my purse. The dust eventually kills it. A local Canon dealer recommended I go with a sealed-lens camera such as the Canon D20. I'm not all that excited about giving up some of the image clarity for the durability. So I'm really on the fence. And the tops of the fence slats are poking me in the butt. I guess I'll keep the A4000 in my purse, but also put it inside a camera case to reduce the amount of dust it encounters while it's in there waiting for me to whip it out for a quick snapshot.I LOVE THIS CAMERA! It feels so wonderful in my hand. It takes decent photos for a camera of its size.

I took pictures of flowers with it and they were blurry. They actually turned out clearer on the auto setting. I took some landscape pictures of mountains that turned out beautiful and had high quality of detail and beautiful color. I think the wide angle works and helps the landscape pictures turn out better. I'm just an very! amateur photographer so I still have a lot to learn. I've noticed that most interior pictures do not require the flash so most of the time I keep it turned off.The A4000IS is heavier and a little bit thicker than the 780 Elph but it still is very portable. I like the rounded corners.One thing I was very disappointed about was that Canon has discontinued including a Manual with it. The manual is on the computer disc. With the 780 Elph I carried my little manual around with me in the case and it was very helpful. Having to look on the computer every time I want to know how to do something is unhandy and impractical on the road.I really don't care for the software and as far as I can tell you have to use it to upload your pictures. My 780 Elph does not require that. I like to use Photoshop Elements to edit my photos so I don't like the extra steps. After downloading the pictures they go to files in the Pictures Section of the Libraries on Windows 8 so I exit the Canon Browser and go straight to Photoshop for editing.Both cameras take regular size SD cards for memory and their batteries come with the camera and are rechargeable and come with a charger that plugs in a wall socket so these features make them a lot cheaper to use.All in all I like the camera okay but I think there are other ones out there in the same price range I might have liked better.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shutter problem", "Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R4KUB6SD3P8RU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Although this may be a one-off issue, thought I should mention it.

I think I found it in the Canon A4000.I've used it only for about a week, but I'm very pleased.  First off, forget about using it in Auto mode because it decides on the ISO setting (what used to be called the ASA number with film).  The higher the ISO, the grainier and less sharp the picture.  For general picture taking you want to set the ISO at the lowest setting (for this camera, 100).  You do that by selecting the P mode (Programmed Auto Exposure).  Photos in Auto mode will be less sharp if the camera automatically sets the ISO higher than 100.  Even though you can't set ISO in Auto mode, you know what the camera is selecting by pressing and holding the shutter button half-way and you see it indicated in the lower right corner of the screen.  Very often, despite what appears to be a well-lit situation, in Auto mode the photo is taken at an ISO higher than 100 which explains a less sharp image than if it were taken in P mode at ISO 100.  Of course, in lower light situations you want to select higher ISOs in order to get proper exposure even though the result won't be as sharp.  A disadvantage for selecting the lowest ISO in P mode is that the shutter speed will often be slower than in Auto mode which risks image blur.  But that should be compensated by the automatic image stabilization feature.Interestingly enough, even though the camera has 16 megapixels its image quality at ISO 100 is no better then my old Fuji with 3 megapixels.  So, I can't say I'm not satisfied although you'd expect that with more than 5 times the pixel resolution, the photos with the A4000 would be somewhat crisper than the old Fuji.... which tells me that the number of megapixels being touted is overblown -- I'm sure a lot depends on the camera's image processor (CMOS vs. CCD) and its other technical characteristics.  At any rate, for a little over a hundred bucks I have no complaints and the photos are good to excellent in sharpness and outstanding in color rendition...plus it fits neatly and lightly in my shirt pocket.  I recommend it.Incidentally, the Canon Image Browser EX software that comes with the camera is OK, for a freebie.  It's not Adobe Photoshop by any means and has some nice features such as image sharpening, but it's ease of use is only fair.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "lens error after 3 months", "Author": "toto \"toto\"", "ReviewID": "R22AU1I7PREU70", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed with this product. the lens cannot shut down after I used it for 3 months, I have to push them back manually every time.

Literally unpacked it (battery was mostly charged) and ran out the door with no manual to do an outdoor photo shoot.  Not bad for user-friendliness, however...Maybe too much function and options were sacrificed to bring the simplicity that makes it user-friendly...Only two complaints:1) Sorry, I like a viewfinder for bright sunny days when screens are difficult to see.  I don't care what direction technology trends have taken- if they don't work, they need to try something that does.  Even a disposable camera from 20 years ago has a viewfinder!  I gave it a chance, knowing it didn't have one, thinking technology had improved over earlier model, but no - I almost sent it back for this one issue.  Come on - It's a CAMERA - It's primary function is to TAKE PICTURES of what you can SEE.  If you can't see your picture, what's the point?  There aren't any excuses to not feature one.2) Navigation buttons are too small and hard to use.  I don't even have fat fingers, and this is another area I feel has let me down, as my earlier model was just fine in this area. (It was a PowerShot SD890IS)But, the zoom is Great!  I would like to see some fun features/options on my future camera like B&W;, Sepia, or something (at least to make it as good as my OLD Sony)  - It's just lacking a lot of options that make a digital camera desirable over something else that lasts for 20 years.----Bottom line, if you are taking pictures only indoors, this is it.  If you are taking pictures anywhere else, like on a bright sunny day, go for something that is at least as good as a much older model.  Sorry Canon, I liked you, but now you've lost me because no \"fun settings\" like other point-and-shoot models on the market, no viewfinder like even a disposable camera has (I'm pro-choice in this area), and no adjustable proportions or photo resolution like a camera from 10-years ago.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slight delay", "Author": "P.

I loved my old camera and since it is no longer made, had to look for something else. I obviously wanted something similar, so I came across this one and read the reviews and they seemed pretty good, I assumed it would be comparable to my old camera. Not so. Now I'm not a professional, but I do take a lot of pictures and expect them to be good quality. When I got this camera, I only used it for a few days because it was much cheaper quality than my old camera. It did not seem to have as many options. When I took photos in various situations, the lighting was bad and the flash would either come on when it shouldn't or not come on when it should resulting in very dark or overly bright photos. Also, a vast majority of the photos were blurry, a problem I never had with my old camera. When I loaded the pics onto my computer and saw just how low quality they were I was very disappointed. The colors were not crisp, they were dull and overall it just was cheap.

It is probably better to leave it on Auto. I had a a Nikon Coolpix S4300 which cost a little more.(I left it on the roof of my car and found it in the street) So I bought a Canon. The Nikon menu is a lot easier though than the Canon, it has more Scenic choices. Bought the Canon at Best Buy total $106. with tax. No extras a USB and electric battery charger, DVD included. You need to buy a SDHC card. The SanDisk I had with my Nokia fits this camera.Pros-Good pictures and videos. Colors come out just like the scene. Really good zoom. I am still learning how to use it. Light weight, nice blue color.Cons-I just got it but it appears battery has to be removed from camera to be charged. It connects to PC to transfer photos but I don't know if the battery charges like the Nikon does when it attached to the PC. This is a nuisance taking the battery out to recharge.

Although I was disappointed with the P mode as the white areas were washed out on an overcast day, on a clear blue day the results were very nice.  Although the LIVE mode allows for adjustments, those adjustments if not careful can affect the color balance.The intitial test pictures were good but not fantastic.  Comparing this camera's photos to our older model Canon Power Shot SD800 IS with a lower pixel count, the SD800 fared a better, which is probably due to the sensor.  That said, you get what you pay for as the A4000 is a budget camera.Still for the price this camera has several different shooting features such as fisheye, minature, vivid, monochrome, etc...  These features allow the photographer to create an effect while taking the picture instead of editing through a program such as Adobe Elements.The Square Trade Warranty purchased direct from Square Trade was less than Amazon and a necessity after our prior experience with the Canon Power Shot SD800 IS breaking mechanically twice.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that I think many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The A4000 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a x8 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. It comes with WiFi- very convenient for easy upload. The weight of the camera is a convenient 145 grams.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

Belt", "ReviewID": "R1Y4UFZPRD90H8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Sony  DSC-W150 encountered an issue as the slot holding the memory card apparently lost a  pin or clip as the card would not longer stay in the camera. Everything else worked great. I shopped around and based upon lots of reviews opted for the Canon PowerShot A4000 as being the closest comparable.There are some features on the A4000 that are better than the Sony. The Canon has 16 megapixels while the Sony 8.1 megapixels. The Sony has a 5 X zoom while the Canon has 8 X zoom. I will keep the rest of the review to the Canon.The body of the Canon is aluminum, however the  door holding the memory card and the battery appears to be plastic which at times does not always open or close that freely. The metal tri pod bush is metal and that is good. The screen is a large 3 inch LCD and thus far has worked great both inside and outside. There is no viewfinder and this seems to be common on today\u2019s lower priced point and shoot cameras. The camera comes in four different colors thus get the one that suits you. Mine is red. There is 720p HD for movie shooting and the quality on just the one I have taken is good.The off/on button is on the top of the camera and if you have big fingers you may find at  times the button is a little hard to turn on and off. It is rectangular and less than \u00bd inch long and imbedded directly into the case at almost case level. Canon advises this button is sunken into the body to prevent accidental depressing when you\u2019re trying to take a picture. The telephoto feature is triggered by the rotating button that surrounds the shutter button. It works fine.The back of the camera is dominated by the 3 inch screen which is not all that bad. The buttons for changes is located on the right and consist of five buttons plus the center ring which has control over four functions. One of the buttons is the top one which is dedicated to the video which I found was easy to operate.The shutter button seems to have a small delay, thus after pushing the button it takes a moment for the shutter to click. I am getting used to it. After power up the shutter button takes a little over two seconds for it to be activated. The memory card is an SD card which is good as it is common and readily obtainable even when traveling.I guess the last question is does it take pictures? I find the quality very acceptable for a point and shoot camera. I use this camera primarily for taking quick photos while traveling and in places that a large digital camera might not be acceptable. Food review pictures are easy to take and after three of four, just drop the small camera in your pocket and this disturbs no one. I have not attempted to make any enlargements for printing as I use a large digital camera for that.

I tried all sorts of things to make it work with no luck.  After some time I finally figured the only way to get it replaced was to send it to Canon directly along with a nice letter explaining how I could not return the item.  It had been a gift from a company (client) and letting the gift giver know it was defective was not an option.  Shortly thereafter I received a proposed repair bill via email for $150.  After several lengthy emails and telephone conversations I still do not have a working camera.  Since I have no specific purchase date and no receipt it would seem I might just be out of luck on this $199 gift.  Yes, you read correctly, $150 to repair a $199 camera which is now valued at $109 here on Amazon.  The best part?  What do I do when I am out on a jobsite with this client and they expect me to use the camera they gave me?  Canon claims to have top notch customer service and quotes endless surveys to prove this is the case.  Apparently they forgot to survey folks like me who think their customer service ranks pretty low.My advice; feel free to buy their products but keep your receipt and note your purchase date so you have a method to return any defective products.

There were items missing; however, the little plastic sleeves were in the box (empty) that I'm sure were supposed to contain those items.  The battery was already installed in the camera, with the battery protector just laying in the box.  When I took the camera out of the sleeve it was in, there was no covering on the screen on the back, to peel off....in fact, the screen appeared scratched and smudged.  I paid for a \"new\" camera and I was very disappointed to open the box and find, what appeared to be, a restocked item.  Yes, I know that stores put items back on the shelf when they're returned; however, I certainly would have expected a quality check before doing so.  This is my first bad review that I've ever given a product and I feel bad in doing so; however, there needs to be better checks put into practice before sending out an order when someone orders a new product.

I hate customer service, regardless of the company, so I tried taking it apart myself but broke two belts in it on accident. I spent money on this camera which was desperately needed for other things, so it feels like a complete waste and let down. I am very disappointed that this camera is not as durable as other cameras I have owned in the past and currently own.Update: I dropped the camera while it was OFF in a round pen which you work horses in, which means the ground was sand. It is soft on the hooves and was soft on the camera, the camera just couldn't handle the dirt. The lens is hardly sealed at all so a lot of the sand went into it, and this in turn completely jammed it, this is what I mean by poor manufacturing, even though the camera was, again, OFF, a ton of sand went into the lens. I still have the first camera I ever used which is a, what I like to call \"crappy\" due to the noise and dead pixels it has, HP. It does not have a retractable lens, is not the size of a cell phone, and because of both of these features, it is incredibly durable, my mother had it since 2003 and bought it used from someone whom I don't know how many years they used it for, and gave it to me in 2007 when I was 12. The image quality was probably superb in its days, but now it is really bad and nothing compared to modern cameras, but it would be fantastic if they could combine durability and image quality, I would buy that camera for sure. I am extremely disappointed that they have sacrificed durability for image quality. I guess I'll have to use my crappy HP until I find a higher quality and durable alternative. I really hope Canon sees my review and puts it to good use, until then, I would not recommend this camera for outdoorsy people or people who just get down and dirty, as this camera can't handle it.For durability, I recommend these two cameras:Fujifilm FinePix Z30 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart 315 2MP Digital CameraIf you have any other durable camera suggestions, let me know. Might start collecting them since they are such a rarity. :)", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.00", "Features": "3-inch LCD display\n16.0 MP Image Sensor, DIGIC 4 Image Processor, 8x Optical Zoom, 28mm Wide-Angle lens\n720p HD video recording with a dedicated movie button\nSmart AUTO with 32 predefined shooting situations, Intelligent IS with six modes to optimize image stabilization\nHelp Button provides simple explanations and easy controls of your settings\n8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens and Optical Image Stabilizer deliver stunning images.\n16.0 MP Image Sensor, DIGIC 4 Image Processor, 8x Optical Zoom, 28mm Wide-Angle lens\n720p HD video recording with a dedicated movie button\nSmart AUTO with 32 predefined shooting situations, Intelligent IS with six modes to optimize image stabilization\n3.0-inch LCD\nHelp Button provides simple explanations and easy controls of your settings", "Name": "Canon PowerShot A4000IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording and 3.0-Inch LCD (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFgiu-tBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0075SUFSC"}}
