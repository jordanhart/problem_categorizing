So, I researched upcoming cameras in June and heard about Panasonic's new Lumix lineup and didn't wait any time to pre order this guy.  It is very compact (smaller than a deck of cards) with a serious range 8x zoom.  Just be sure you want a camera that takes all the manual control of picture taking before you buy it.  There is almost no manual settings, other than choosing which \"scene\" you think your shot will be.  Panasonic has some fun settings - Pin Hole, film grain, and the key word that people love \"High Dynamic\" mode, which is their attempt to create a High Dynamic Range type of shot.  They also have an underwater setting, for those who will later shell out the money for the casing to take this baby in the pool or some other form of wet.  The Leica name on the lens is what got me looking at panasonic cameras, and as far as I can tell, its a fine lens.  It is no DSLR, but it is a great incognito camera.Video is Average, but I wasn't really concerned about it.  -- When I say average, I'm comparing it to video I've seen taken from a camcorder.  The HD component is nice, but you'd need to be still holding it and hope whatever you're filming is not moving too fast for a great recording.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buying decision: 720p HD Video, 8x Zoom, Power O.I.S.", "Author": "I. Besenfelder", "ReviewID": "RJTDAMKUXRD6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumix ZR1 is a very good snapshot and HD video camera.I got the ZR1 around a month ago and I am still enthusiastic. The most important things besides picture quality were for me, that the cam should be fast and able to zoom while recording HD video. I hate the low res VGA videos, the older generation cams made. You can't use them for anything. My first reference was the Lumix ZS3, which is a really good camera and it had all I wanted... Until I found out, that some experts claimed that the \"Mega Optical Image Stabilizer\" works a bit slow, so that when taking snapshots there is a longer focus time. But I was lucky, that Panasonic just released this little beauty here. The ZR1 uses a newer much faster OIS, called \"Power OIS\", which is even faster than most other snapshot cameras, while canceling camera shakes very well. So for me there was no time to wait and get this thing.If you are not so focused on speed, check out the ZS3!Main differences between the SR1 and the ZS3:SR1:- 12MP- Zoom-able 720p HD Video- Power O.I.S.- 8x Zoom- 2.7\" displayZS3:- 10MP- Zoom-able 720p HD Video- Mega O.I.S.- 12x Zoom- 3\" displayComments on the comparison:- Megapixels aren't the point anyway, because even 8MP are very enough for the normal user, but I had to mention the difference.- Both cams record the same HD Video, so that's also no point- The OIS made a difference for me: \"Power\" is faster than \"Mega\". I think they just fixed a software issue here.- Zooming while recording video is a nice and (by this time) rare feature at snapshot cameras. Either zoom, 8x and 12x is huge! Of course 12x would be better than 8x, so this point goes to the ZS3.- Also the display of the ZS3 is bigger.Conclusion: If you don't care how fast your stabilized auto focus is (perhaps you use tripods so that you don't need a OIS, or have always time to make your shoot - it's really NOT that bad, it's just a bit slower), get the ZS3 (zoom and display is better)! Otherwise the ZR1 is perfect (fast and still fat zooming).", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not up to expectations", "Author": "Ganesh Ramamoorthy \"Scientifix\"", "ReviewID": "R1JFU5MDRIBXZM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews of both Panasonic ZS3 and Panasonic ZR1 and I decided to check out the ZR1 as it was supposed to have the newer/better image stabilization and smaller in size. The size was definitely small enough and image stabilization was decent. The picture quality was quite good in bright light conditions but lower in low-light conditions, but this seems to be an issue with any of the digital cameras at this price point.But where it really disappointed was in the video mode. I noticed that when I switch the mode dial to the video mode the brightness of what was displayed on the camera's LCD screen became much lower compared to the photo mode. First I thought that this may be just an issue I'm seeing on LCD screen but when I transferred the video and watched it on my laptop and my TV I saw that the videos in fact looked dulled out compared to the photos. So pretty much any video that is shot indoors looked dull and kinda of poor quality.I then decided to try out the ZS3 also and immediately saw that this issue isn't there in the ZS3. To capture video on the ZS3 you don't have to change the mode dial but simply have to press a \"record\" button and I don't know if this has anything to do with this, but the videos were as bright as the photos on the ZS3. So the videos shot indoors are much better, both brighter and better quality, with the ZS3 compared to the ZR1.I also did comparisons of photos taken by the two models and surprisingly I felt the ZS3 was better there too (despite the fact that ZR1 boasts 2MP more). Also, I didn't find the image stabilization of ZS3 in anyway inferior to that of ZR1.So after all my side-by-side comparisons I found the ZS3 to be definitely a better camera which I have kept and returned the ZR1. The ZR1 is definitely more compact than the ZS3 and does have quicker start up times (and possibly even faster zoom times). But, at the end of the day, in my opinion the ZS3 is a superior camera when it comes to videos and even photos, with the additional zoom capabilities (12X of ZS3 vs 8X in ZR1).", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Be realistic", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R2I77HNPS88DD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Stop the nonsense!  This is a tiny camera - smaller than a deck of cards with an F3.3 lens and a necessarily tiny ccd, and people are expecting low light capability from it.  Get real!  Photography requires light.  When you give this little thing light, it does an amazing job!  Yes the images at night with poor incandescent light and without flash are grainy.  Does anyone remember the grainy images from film cameras with pushed 400 iso? If you want a low light camera, get a big heavy camera with a large sensor and a nice F1.8 lens.  If you want a tiny gem of an engineering miracle that takes sharp, well exposed, true colored photographs, get this little Lumix ZR1! It does everything one can rationally expect, given the laws of Physics, and does them extremely well!", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good, but I like the ZS3 better", "Author": "B. Bass", "ReviewID": "R24PVAOZO02B0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time lately reviewing compact digital cameras.  I knew that zoom was one of my highest priorities so I ended up settling on the panasonics.  I have now owned both the ZR1 and ZS3 and I prefer and will keep the ZS3, although it is a very close call.  Both cameras are pretty much the exact same as far as operation and menus go.  They each have iA and normal modes, to go along with twenty something scene modes like high sensitivity, high speed burst, portrait, starry sky, fireworks, etc...  There is definitely the most control in Normal Picture mode, and that is the mode I take almost all of my pictures in.  I never use the iA (intelligent auto) mode.  While they are billed as fully automatic cameras with no manual controls, you can choose the sensitivity (ISO 80-1600, auto), adjust the exposure (-2 to +2 eV), choose a minimum shutter speed (1 to 1/125 for ZR1, 1 to 1/250 for ZS3), which , while it is not capable of extremely long exposures, it is effective at forcing a very fast shutter speed if you are trying to get action shots.  You can also set the white balance.  Both cameras also have a button for a quick menu which brings up relevant parameters you might want to alter in that mode so you don't have to scroll through the menus.  For instance, in normal mode, if you press the quick menu button, Auto focus mode, white balance selection, ISO, picture size, aspect ratio, burst mode, LCD power all pop up on the top of the screen for easy access.  I only wish that the minimum shutter speed control would also pop up with the quick menu,  Each camera also comes with an extended optical zoom, where you can get an extra zoom by reducing the picture size.  With this feature, the ZR1 moves from a 8x zoom to 15.6x, and ZS3 goes from 12x to 21.4x.  Here I must give a point to the ZR1.  The ZS3 puts a much greater emphasis on video, and I really don't care about video.  There is a little red button on the back of the ZS3 that automatically records video, you don't have to be in motion picture mode.  In its place on the ZR1 is an E. zoom button.  This button automatically zooms the camera to full tele (8x) and if you press it twice it automatically extends the lens to its full capabilities, 15.6x.  On the ZS3, you have to go to the menus and manually lower the picture size to attain your extended zoom, rather than just press a button.  I like the ZR1's take on this much better, but if you care about video, you might like this part of the ZS3 better.Of the two, the ZR1 is quite a bit smaller, and weighs 50% less.  I didn't know how much of a difference this actually makes until I actually held both of them in my hands.  If size is your number one priority you might want to go with the ZR1.  I never wear jeans, so I'm not sure how well it would work with them, because I know some people have complained about the ZS3 not being pocketable.  I always wear basketball shorts or wind pants, and the ZS3 easily fits into my pockets.  Though it is heavier and therefore feels less comfortable and less natural, I also have had no real problems using the ZS3 with one hand.  The ZR1 also focuses a little faster than the ZS3, though this difference only becomes really noticeable when zoomed in under low light conditions.  Both cameras seem to take about the same amount of time to extend to their fullest zoom, but the ZR1 can retract back to wide angle a little faster.  The ZR1 starts up marginally faster than the ZS3, though this is also barely noticeable.  When on a tripod, the image quality of both is good, I couldn't tell a difference really in the two on my computer screen, but there is noticeable noise at low light in both starting at ISO 200.  If anything, I think the ZR1 actually reproduces colors a little better than the ZS3, though neither one is bad.  The ZR1 also has pretty good battery life for a compact camera.  It actually uses the exact same battery as the ZS3, which has a much greater power need, so the ZR1 will get good battery life, and noticeably better than the ZS3.  Where the ZR1 falls short is on indoor photos.  The ZR1 has a much narrower aperture, so it lets in less light.  This makes it hard to take photos in low light, and as a result, you must use a slower shutter speed, which will result in blurry pictures when taking handheld pictures.  I would say that about half of my pictures taken inside with the ZR1 came out blurry.  Panasonic says that this isn't a problem because of the new Power O.I.S., but image stabilization can not fix everything.  I am also not convinced that the Power O.I.S. is any better than the older Mega O.I.S.  At any rate, more of my pictures came out blurry with the ZR1 than the ZS3.  Also, the newest Panasonics, released January 2010, are equipped with Mega O.I.S and not Power, which is kind of interesting.ZR1Pros- SMALLER SIZE AND WEIGHT!- Feels more comfortable in hand, looks sleeker, more attractive- E. zoom button in place of movie record button- Better battery life- Slightly faster focusing, especially when zoomed in under low light- Faster response in general (very slightly)- Has two additional scene modes that ZS3 doesn't haveZS3Pros- Wider minimum aperture lets it take much CLEARER HANDHELD PICTURES- EXTRA ZOOM- BETTER LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE- Better HD video, with an HDMI out port- Better overall image quality- Shutter control down to 1/250 second instead of 1/125- I believe the ZS3 burst mode is a little better- Higher resolution screenOverall, the ZR1 is a very good camera I think, unless you plan to do a lot of indoor shots.  I never use the flash with a camera if I can help it, so if you plan on using the flash whenever you are inside, the ZR1 will be fine for you.  Without the flash, it was just too hard to get a clear shot indoors, especially if you have the lens extended at all.  It is your typical compact camera size, with good speed and picture quality, and the best zoom I could find in a camera this small.  I'm used to using my parents' camera which is a lot higher end and has much more as far as manual controls, but there are not a lot of choices in compact point and shoots with manual controls.  It is extremely easy to use, I don't think anybody will really have a problem operating it.  The menus are very intuitive, and the quick menu will pop up most of the things you might want to fiddle with to get the picture you want.  The camera also feels very good in the hand, and feels like it is made well  It comes with a CD that is the user's manual, which does a pretty good job of explaining what all the scene modes and features of the camera do.  For a camera with no manual controls this one does have a lot of features, and does give you more control than just point and shoot as some would imply.  I was generally well pleased with the picture quality of this camera for the price.  I guess you just have to be realistic and realize that one this small cannot excel at everything, and this camera was made for good lighting rather than indoor shots.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Remarkable for such a compact camera", "Author": "Derek Crane", "ReviewID": "R5OGVN581N2IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a Panasonic FX35 for almost two years and been very pleased with its handling and performance for a camera so small.  When I saw the Panasonic ZR1 with double the zoom range (25-200mm compared to 25-100mm for the FX35) I decided to upgrade.  Both cameras are the same size.  The FX35 was good.  The ZR1 is even better.  Having 8x zoom in a camera weighing less than 6oz is astounding. Not only that, but there are two other new features I have grown to appreciate: High Dynamic scene mode and improved image stabilization (anti-shake). This combination means that virtually every photo is a keeper, especially if you shoot both standard and High Dynamic of the same scene and compare--one will be perfect.  High Dynamic opens up images with shadows or dimmer interior shots in a more natural way than flash, which I only use as a last resort.  The improved anti-shake system allows use of the full 200mm end of the zoom if you have reasonably steady hands in good daylight.  Add the reasonable price and this is a great camera.  After three months of use, I haven't encountered a downside.  Perhaps that's because I also have a DSLR for more demanding shooting, but for people, pets and travel, it is the best I have owned and I've been a photography buff for 45 years and owned more than 30 cameras.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent outdoor camera, poor low light  indoor performance", "Author": "quest754", "ReviewID": "R1LZHKRNNRMLVR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After seeing drastically different review on this camera, you must be confused and puzzled. How can the same camera bring different results to different users?The key is under what condition the ZR1 being used. After a month of use in different settings, I finally realize that the lighting condition is what make the ZR1 an excellent or a poor camera.I have a TZ1 for 5 years and have been a big fan of it. But recently I can't stand its slow performance so I looked for a upgrade. I finally decided on ZR1 instead of DSLR or ZS3(TZ7) because of portability and high speed focus. In outdoor the ZR1 does deliver. Today I took my 4 years old daughter out for roller skating and I was able to shoot both beautiful photos and video while I myself was rolling! I wouldn't be able to do that with a DSLR.But at indoor, the ZR1 failed quite miserably. It produced grainy picture. I have settled back to the TZ1 for indoor use now. I think the smaller lens of ZR1 is the root problem. I wish they keep the same lens size. That would be perfect!So the conclusion? I can't complain much because it costs only about $250 and it does provide a lot of value: snappy shooting, good picture quality, good zoom, ok video and ultra portability.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect point and shoot", "Author": "City Mouse", "ReviewID": "R2T34DO8V8Y5GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending months reading and comparing features and reviews of compact point and shoot digital cameras, I decided to take a chance on the Lumix DMC-ZR1.  I say 'take a chance' because, if you're reading this review, you've probably read (or are getting ready to read) a ton of reviews and, no doubt, noticed the range of opinions.  Also, like all advanced technological devices, nothing lasts long, you can always get a lemon, and you're replacing electronics faster than underwear.  Long and short of it, I'm thrilled with my new camera.  This is my third digital camera in 5 years (whoa! 5 years?)  Well, I love taking pictures.  The Lumix is everything you want in a compact digital without the huge price tag.  A well thought out display.  Solid construction. Feels good in the hand.  Intuitive.  Lots of scene settings. And terrfic pictures.  I've taken indoor and outdoor shots, with and without flash (and the camera allows forced flash or flash-off).  I haven't taken a bad picture, yet.  Colors are rich.  Skin tones, natural.  Inside flash doesn't wash out faces (face recognition is excellent).  I tend to do a lot of snap, snap, snapping when I'm on vacation so the image stabilizer is great for taking shots on the go.  The wide angle lens ensures you're outdoor shots will have drama.  The superfast (and ultra quiet) zoom lives up to the hype.  If you're looking at Canon Powershots or Elfs, Sony Cybershots, or Fuji Finepixs (my last camera), I recommend you consider the Lumix.  I think you're going to find the performance on a par or better than those competitors and for a much nicer pricetag.

Love the image stabilization. It's lightweight, portable, with nice ergonomics and very easy to operate with one hand. Fits into a pocket or small purse easily. I bought the red one (love the color!) but am posting here since most of the reviews are under the black version (doesn't amazon usually combine the reviews for various colors? amazon, are you listening?)ANYWAY, I put the camera in iA mode and started taking photos of my dogs, indoors, in medium to low light. Even with flash on, the shutter speed is often 1/8 second in low light. That's fine for taking pix if the pups are sleeping...but not to record the activities of my two high-energy terriers. Many of the photos are blurry, not from camera movement but from subject movement. My 5-year old Casio Exilim EX-Z55 is producing better pix under these circumstances.I don't doubt this is a a very good camera...just not ideal for my situation. I saw another reviewer mention having his kids do a \"jump test\" (which this camera failed) and I think I've got pretty much the same issues.

The ZR1 is an excellent value.For me having a strong optical zoom is critical to my work and the 8x zoom on the ZR1 is very good.  Even on the maximum zoom the new Panasonic Image Stabilization keeps things in focus.  In the past I have favored larger more bulky cameras, many times a result fo the optical zoom, but the ZR1 is one of the tiniest and compact cameras I have ever used.  In fact let me say this, for some people this camera may be too small, please note the dimensions and weight of the camera if that is of any concern to you.  Along these lines, though small in footprint, the build quality is top-notch.  It is one solid little device and nothing feels cheap about it.  For example, the USB connector door has a great feel to it and snap open and shut with a satisfying click.  Some cameras have very flimsy doors that tend to become loose or even break with repeated use.

The TZ3 was the best camera I had used since I went digital in 1997. We are both real estate appraisers and take pictures in all lighting conditions. I assumed that the increased pixels in the ZR1 would provide better pictures. Starting with the first pictures I took the images were very grainy and noisy. I tried all types of settings after the iA did not provide a clear image. I honestly thought that the camera lens or sensor was damaged and sent it to Panasonic for repairs or replacement. They basically said nothing was wrong with the one I sent and sent me another one. Its pictures were only slightly better but still not something I want to use in my appraisals.I had an email and phone conversation with a tech at the Panasonic repair center. I sent him sample photos and the following link to explain one of my problems with the camera.[...]The blotches and gainyness in low light is the worst of any camera I have ever had. I need to be able to bring out detail and writing on signs under an awning on a sunny day in a photo taken from my car some 50+- feet away. This camera cannot do that. I tried to make the shadows brighter when processing it with photoshop elements levels or highlight shadow, but have no success. The high dynamic setting produces an image that is blurry with minimal lightening of the dark areas.The image stabilization does not seem to work. With my old TZ3 I could take a zoomed photo of a stain or crack on a high ceiling in a building with no lights and it would come out clear without a flash. The ZR1 will not provide a clear image. The edges of walls or books or other objects, viewed at 100% in photoshop, are indistinct dots that are out of focus.I am not satisfied with this camera and need to replace it with one that works.If you use a camera for business purposes do not buy the ZR1.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR1", "Author": "S.

Hill", "ReviewID": "RS1GCDVBN745M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having an unfortunate accident with my Panasonic FS7, I needed a new camera.  I dallied with the Pentax Optio P80--a horrendous experience--and promptly returned that pitiful excuse for a camera in favor of another Panasonic, the ZR1.  All in all, I am fairly impressed with the picture quality and the HD video quality.  I really like that it shoots video at 30 frames per second as opposed to some pricier Canon or Sony models which shoot 15 fps.  Although not a razor thin camera by any means, it is still very, very small and portable.I really just have two criticisms:(1) Telescopic lens: the housing to the telescopic lens is pretty flimsy.  It is the same housing that my FS7 had, and the reason I had to trash my FS7 was that it took a minor tumble on a hardwood floor right after I finished taking a zoom shot.  That flimsy plastic housing dented and cracked, and jacked up the camera.  I have played with Canons and Sonys that have sturdy metallic housings that probably would have withstood this.(2) Shooting mode dial: I don't really care for the dial that you have to turn to go from Intelligent Auto (which works very well by the way) to Video to Manual to Scene modes.  Well, I suppose I wouldn't mind it so much if it had an IA button like the FS7 did which would toggle between Intelligent Auto and your last other mode you used (e.g. Video, which I used to toggle back and forth with a lot).  Minor hassle having to turn that dial rather than having a 'hotkey'.All in all though, a great camera.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "All you could ever need without bumping up to a DSLR", "Author": "Shredder \"More BPM!\"", "ReviewID": "R1SSF70JFQVSBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic camera, shoots quick, starts up quick, quality is great even when set to 3 or 5 megapixles. its light, small, durable, and stylish. everything is easy to figure out and use.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Little gem with somewhat disappointing image quality", "Author": "W.

I could get this camera or a bigger panasonic ZS1 for the same price, I chose this for the portability and (supposedly) faster operation.First of all, it is really small for its capability, just a bit longer than the canon SD400 I own. Therefore it is very pocketable.It is also very fast at operation, as promised. It start fast, focus fast, and does not show much shutter lag. So it is a very nimble camera.One feature ZR1 does not have, but the ZS1 has, is that ZS1 could shoot continuously at 2fps indefinitely, while ZR1 is limited at 3 or 5 pictures, depending on image compression/size. I wish that I knew this ahead of my purchase.One area does disappoint me a bit though. It is the image quality and the noise. Granted, it is a small camera with a tiny sensor on which 12MP is squeezed on. I don't really appreciate the trend of \"more pixel is better\". But that is the way it is. I have owned Canon S30, which had 3MP on the 1/1.8 sensor. I also have a canon SD400 and a DSLR pentax  K100D. The canon S30 is known for low noise and high quality picture. The canon sd400 is not quite as clean, but manageable. Needless to say, the K100D is nearly noise free below ISO400. So I am somewhat spoiled by noise free pictures.ZR1 pictures showed quite a bit noise, even at ISO80, the lowest. The pictures do not appear very sharp, giving a feeling of haziness. Comparison of pictures of ZR1, ZS1 and Canon SX120 from a review website showed that ZS1 shows noise of similar extend and pattern (kind of block of noise, not single pixel), while the Canon SX120 pictures have similar level of noise, but finer in grainess. As the result, the pictures from the Canon SX120 looked better before and after noise reduction treatment, compared to ZR1, ZS1 pictures.Remember though, the analysis above is pretty much pixel peeking. I did not expect perfect photos from a camera this small, at this price. I will keep the camera, as it fits my needs and budget, as a pocket camera for outdoor/travel/tourism with great zoom. The photos are quite decent when not looked at pixel-by-pixel, and get better with some noise reduction.Bottom line is, ZR1 is a good camera with limitations. Keep this in mind when you purchase it, and keep it at low ISO when you use it.

The image sharpness is totally unacceptable, even with a tripod in bright daylight, for distant scenery. Despite its 12 Million pixels, I have taken much better pictures with 3 Megapixel camera and just as good with a one-megapixel Kodak when digital cameras first came out. I have returned it to Panasonic for a replacement, which (I am told) will also be refurbished. The camera comes with no cable for TV readout -- a non-HD connector is available at extra cost. I had expected 1080p High-def; a big letdown there. (Other Lumix models may offer it). The instructions you need for this camera's many settings are explained in a 170-page CD-ROM .pdf file only. The paperwork you get is only about 15 pages. I tried to order a hard copy by email and got no reply. It is hard to believe that a Leica lens could take such bad pictures. Perhaps the autofocus mechanism or algorithm is at fault. If the replacement they send me is just as bad, I will just have to throw it away.On the positive side, it looks nice and the exposure levels are just about right. The LCD screen is just bright enough to use in broad daylight, but it was difficult to evaluate image sharpness and composition outdoors in daylight.

Depending on the size of your memory card and how many pictures you want the time/date stamp, you may want to have a bowl of ice handy to soak your sore thumb afterwards.2. Someone at work told me I can get a software package that allows me to put the time/date stamp on the picture.  Our lives are busy enough without having to deal with another software package in order to put a time/date stamp on a picture.3. Return this camera and get a camera that has a simple and global on-off time/date stamp feature.We are choosing the 3rd option.  On a general note, I like that Amazon lets its customers write reviews.  I think it helps people make decisions and helps solve problems.  It also allows people to sort through what they think is an important issue or not. For example, if I had known about the time/date stamp feature of this camera, I would have never purchased it in the first place.  Maybe my review of this camera will help someone.  Thanks.Original Comment:We must be missing something with the date/time stamp. The other two digital cameras that we had gave us the ability to turn on or turn off the date stamp. We cannot find where this camera allows you to do that. All we can find is the ability to select which pictures you want to time/date stamp after you take the picture {only up to about 40 at a time}. and there is not a select all feature. You have to manually select each individual picture {even if you select multi} that you want to time/date stamp. Hopefully, someone else who owns this camera can tell me I'm missing something. Otherwise, we'll be returning this one for one that has a true time/date stamp feature. With, having two young kids, the time/date stamp feature on the pictures is something we really enjoyed.
