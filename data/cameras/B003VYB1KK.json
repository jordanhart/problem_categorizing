{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exceptional Low Light performance", "Author": "Brian Monahan", "ReviewID": "R2QFL8KZCI4IXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera last month and took its through its paces on a trip through Canada. I usually travel with a Canon 7D, wide angle and moderate telephoto with accessory flash. I wanted a camera that I could take with me in my pocket and leave behind the much heavier gear. I realized there was no substitute for the SLR Canon camera on image quality and would suggest a comparason is unfair.  The Fuji 300 EXR did an exceptional job given my expectations not to compare it to the SLR. I would highly recommend it as among the best possible choices in a traveller's camera today. It is definately a compromise over the SLR, but it is a very good compromise. The micro four thirds cameras may have some performance advantages but the high cropping factor of the sensor (2x), bulk, and high total cost to own (with a wide angle and modest zoom lens > 1000.00) led me to select the Fuji f300EXRStrong points:-used in museums and in meetings with fluorescent light (no flash): the best perfomance I have ever seen in a point and shoot. (Better than my Canon SD940 IS) The images have good contrast and low/modest noise even at extreems of its very long zoom.-very wide zoom range: unheard of range in a pocket size camera that is very usable-excellent automatic exposure mode in a wide range of lighting from bright sun to dim fluorescent-Very good image stabilization to give sharp photos even at > 350mm zoom hand held-very good fit and finish metal consruction that withstood abuse of carrying in suit pants pocket-suprising dynamic range for image capture of a brightly lit scene's dimmer areas-autofocus in strong light was very fast (as claimed) but nothing exceptional in reduced light-very good image quality with high ISO (400), acceptable quality at 800Weak Points:-start up time delay is quite long (3-4 secs)so you need to keep it on to catch the shot-built in flash is called \"super intelligent\" but super-weak is a more accurate term-total dependence on LCD for framing and focus requires need to learning a shot stabilization stance and hand hold. You definately need an extra battery for travelling with this camera- IS mode and screen drain battery-time to image with flash shots after pressing shutter can be as long as 2 seconds and shot can be easily missed-no raw capture mode (dependent on Fuji JPEG) with strong \"purple fringing\" on illuminated edges-the EXR mode takes some time to figure out, but it seems the megapixel count reduction when the high sensitivity/low noise option is engaged, still leaves a file with better image quality than I was getting with a 12MP sensor camera with full time 12 MP capture-the finepix bundled software is fair, but you would be much better off with Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 or 8-does not come with the micro HDMI video cable you need to see the HD video-I have this now on order to evaluate the video performance.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is the future of compact digital cameras!", "Author": "D. Matheny", "ReviewID": "R2Y2ITRPHGVFL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I remember getting my first digital camera almost 10 years ago.  In many ways it was an amazing device - we could take as many pictures as we wanted without having to worry about film, and we could review our pictures instantly without waiting to get the film developed.  On the flip side of this, the slow focus speeds of digital cameras vs. film cameras was a major irritation.  Now, 10 years later, digital cameras have improved a LOT - but the slow focus problem is something we've just learned to live with... until now.When I first unboxed and started playing around with the FinePix F300EXR, I was instantly impressed.  This would have been an easy 5-star review if I hadn't spent several days taking hundreds of pictures at a family event first.  Now, after playing with it for a while, I'm waffling between 3 & 4 stars - which is unfortunate since this camera has so much to offer.  I'll go over each feature that has impressed me, positively or negatively, and I'll try to keep each section brief since there is a lot to say about this camera.*** Focus Speed ***The first thing I noticed about this camera was the nearly instant focus speed.  It works great in pretty much any lighting and just blows any other compact digital camera I've used out of the water.  This camera dispenses with all the fancy processing to determine which zone or face to focus on - and just focuses in the center like a point-and-shoot film camera would have done.  The resulting focus speed is unbelievable!It's funny that I'm having to get used to focusing on a subject and recomposing the picture again.  With most other digital cameras, that work is done by the camera while it is focusing.  With this camera, if a subject isn't in the focus area when you take a picture, everything is likely to be out of focus except for that lone tree in the distance. :)This is an area that I will gladly give out 5 stars on.  The focus speed is on par with what I would expect from a high-end SLR.*** Zoom ***This is another area where this camera excels.  With such a small, pocketable footprint - it's amazing that Fujifilm was able to pack such a great zoom range into the camera!  It covers everything I need, from wide to tele in a camera that is the same size as my Canon 3x zoom camera.  The image stabilization also works great and makes it easy to hold the camera steady at long zoom distances.This is another 5 star feature.*** Interface ***The user interface on this camera is extremely easy to use.  I love the large easy-to-read menus and descriptions that always seem to come up at the right time.  Honestly, I would never have guessed that a camera could be this easy to use.On the flip side, the funtion select dial is situated at an angle where it is VERY EASY to get turned by accident in my pocket.  I've found myself in the wrong mode several times already because of this and I've taken pictures that turned out horrible since the shutter speed was turned way down.  This isn't a knock on the camera, just something I'm having to learn to check whenever I pull it out of my pocket to turn it on.I'm also learning not to put my finger where the popup flash comes up.  It seems like my natural grip puts a finger right in that position.*** Overall Performance ***The overall performance of this camera is the area that really pulls the rating down.  It turns on quickly; but, there is a several second delay before it's actually ready to take pictures.  This means you need to have it on already when you expect to be taking a shot - instead of waiting for the last second like I've grown accustomed to.The time between shots was so long that it was driving my crazy.  The problem is that this camera does all its face recognition processing after the shot instead of doing it as part of the focusing.  That ends up leaving the camera completely unusable for several seconds after each shot - which is a major irritation.  Fortunately, the face recognition feature can be turned off - and I recommend that anyone using this camera should do that right away.  With the face recognition disabled, the shot-to-shot time becomes much more reasonable.*** Battery Life ***The first day I used this camera, I thought the battery life was horrible.  I didn't even make it through 200 pictures before it died completely.  Once I turned off the face recognition feature, the battery life improved quite a bit; so, once again, I would recommend that feature be turned off.*** Low Light Performance ***Before starting on this section, I've noticed some other reviews that claim this camera has the best low light performance they've ever seen - while other reviews talk about how crummy it is.  My suspicion is that the people talking about awesome low light performance are talking about the focus performance of the camera - and it is very good as I've already mentioned.  On the flip side, I think the people who mention crummy performance are talking about picture quality.  In my case, I'm referring to picture quality in this section.Having said that, the low light performance of this camera is about what I would expect.  Because of the small size of the sensor in compact digital cameras, low light performance will never be as good as it is with an SLR.  This camera, however, is on par with other cameras the same size.I do think the flash may be a bit weak, but it's not a huge difference from other compact cameras.  The flash also takes quite a while to charge.Low light performance is boosted somewhat by the fact that the ISO levels are able to go very high; but, the resulting pictures obviously get grainier as ISO levels increase.*** Picture Quality ***This 12 megapixel camera is just about where I would expect for picture quality.  It's not better or worse than other cameras that are about the same size.*** Build Quality ***When I hold this camera, it just screams 'High Quality'.  It has nice rubber grips and every thing about it seems high end.  This is an area where this Fuji camera just blows away other digital cameras I've used that seem to be built to be disposable.*** Conclusion ***Overall, I am really enjoying this camera.  The first impression was great, and then I went though a period where the slow performance was driving me crazy.  Now that the face recognition has been disabled, I'm learning to like it again.I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a faster focus and is willing to make sure the shots are properly composed manually instead of letting the digital camera do it automatically.  In my opinion, it's worth the effort.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Pictures, Amazing Features, Amazing Camera!", "Author": "Robert L.

can say with all honesty that this new Fujifilm F300 EXR has literally redefined what I think of as a quality digital camera.  This guy is amazing -- and once you try out its wide-angle lense and facial recognition features you won't want to stop taking pictures everywhere you go!I fell in love with the camera because of the wide-angle lens and 15x zoom and just kept being impressed the more I used it.  You'll never \"chop off\" another person or a part of the scenery again thanks to its wonderful lens that doesn't require you to backup 50 feet to get everyone in the picture.  Then there is the 15x built-in zoom.  You never want to judge a camera by its digital zoom as that degrades the picture, so when I found out this camera had a 15x \"true zoom\" I was blown away.  I zoomed in the full 15x and my picture was still just as clear and crisp as it was when I didn't use the zoom.  Of course a lot of that crispness also comes from the fact this guy is a 12 megapixel camera.Battery life is awesome -- two days later and almost 100 pictures later I'm still going strong; the flash uses a multi-flash setup so instead of blinding your subject with a single white flash it pulsates the flash so you get rid of redeye and don't bleach out your photos in low light conditions.  Of course when you get tired of just taking plain pictures this guy can take high-definition video as well.  You'll never need to carry around both a video camera and a still picture camera again!In the video I talk about some of my favorite features of this camera plus give you a small tour.  When I say that this camera blows away the competition, I'm not kidding -- it's an amazing little guy with so much power packed into a 1.5lb body!  My only complaint is the placement of the flash -- but it's one small weakness compared to the numerous strengths and in the end wasn't even worth taking a star away for.What's in the box?  The camera, a USB cable, battery, wall-wart battery charger, A/V cables, hand strap, software and getting started guide.  Another plus to this camera -- it comes with its own rechargeable battery complete with wall charger!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best of Both Worlds SLR and Easy Auto Digital

I have included a short slide show of various pictures I have taken with the camera. I have used all the settings and functions and all are represented in the show. Well except the movie, I had to make a choice.This is my third digital camera and I am a long time user of SLR cameras with tons of lenses. This baby makes life so much easier. You can choose your own manual exposure settings or do it all automatically. You can do super close macro shots all the way to 360 degree panorama shots. It recognizes faces of humans, cats and dogs, how cool is that. In the EXR setting it adjusts the light and finds the right mode as in macro or landscape no searching for settings.Movies record in HD! In fact all the time when you are looking at the LCD screen you see HD quality views. It is really great. I have taken 5 movies and this is my only con of the camera. In very bright sunlight I got some vertical lines in the shots. The manual says this is normal and will happen but still a bit disappointing. I took one movie in low room lighting and it didn't compensate very well as I would have wished to that lighting although it showed the night time icon. I consider these isolated events and would not keep me from loving this camera.I took my time after I got the camera and went a bunch of different places over the few weeks. I got still shots of things and lots of nature shots which I love, children and animals. Macro and Panoramic. There is one picture of a lake and in the far distance you see some red and orange reflections, then the next picture is 15X zoom, amazing clarity it was like I was right there.You can do macro without getting down on the ground as seen with the wooly-worm. Had to say that, looks like a cold winter. I am 6 foot tall and I didn't bend down I just zoomed in, perfect clarity.The camera is very light weight only 7.8 ounces. It has a blinking flash that reduces the red eye. The one function that does take some getting used to is also in the movie mode. You are pressing a small button on the back of the camera but to stop the recording you have to turn off the camera and that takes some practice so you don't have this jump at the end you later have to edit. Also at first I wanted to hold the camera on the area where the flash is but I very quickly got used to holding it just a bit differently.If you want control like an SLR and the simplicity both in the same camera this is the best I have seen. I don't think you will be disappointed. The feel of the camera is also high quality and it looks so sleek. Well worth the money.When ordering be sure to pick up the FujiFilm 4GB SDHC card as it doesn't come with one. The battery lasts a long time even when shooting a mix of video and pictures. I shot 5 movies and 121 picture off of one charge.I could go on and on but you can read the specs yourself I need not repeat what is already here. I believe that the statement one picture is worth a thousand words will be true of my slide show and I hope that you enjoy it. I had a blast using this camera.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor low light performance, disappointing images.", "Author": "Becki Robins \"Mother of Four\"", "ReviewID": "R302UNQ1OCR8DO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this camera's predecessor (the F200 EXR) on my wishlist for a long time, then this camera was announced and I asked my husband to buy it for me as a birthday present, instead of the well-reviewed F200. I take a lot of indoor pictures and I really dislike flash photos and photos with a lot of noise. I have read many reviews of the F200, which has been praised for its ability to perform in low light. I naively assumed that this camera, being the next in the series, would be equally good at low light photography. I shouldn't have taken the chance.Even at low ISO this camera creates noise. It has a smaller image sensor than the F200, which automatically equals lower quality photos. The noise is quite obvious when the images are viewed with image processing software, though less obvious when printed. To be fair, photos taken outdoors in full sunshine look fine when printed, even when printed at 8x10. If you're going to take mostly outdoor photos this camera should be fine, and it does have a lot of cool features. You can't really find point and shoot cameras with longer zoom. The 360 degree panoramic feature is really cool, and it works great. Also, not only does this camera recognize faces, it recognizes *specific* faces. Once you tell it who a person is it can apply that person's name to the notes of his/her image whenever you snap a picture. Cool. Gimmicky (I can't really think of a great use for this feature) but cool.I was almost on the verge of deciding to keep this camera after a camping trip turned out a lot of pretty decent images. Then when we returned home I took an indoor photo of my five year old son passed out on the linoleum in our very brightly lit kitchen, and when I viewed the photo in Photoshop was reminded of just how poorly this camera performs indoors, even in the middle of the day with sunshine streaming in from several windows. Zooming even to just 100%, the image looked like it had a watercolor filter applied to it. It was blotchy and grainy with hideously undefined edges. Even my husband, who is far less fussy than I am about image quality, looked at the photos and said he would send the camera back ... which is what I decided to do in the end. Even its cool features and decent outdoor performance aren't enough to make up for its poor quality images.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expectations satisfied", "Author": "E.

I've been using the camera for 2 weeks and all the expectations are fulfilled so far, great quality pictures, amazing optical zoom, unparalleled panoramic mode ( beats the one on the Sony cybershot models by a 360 degrees compared to a maximun of 180 or 225 on sony models ), easy to manage with manual and automatic modes, and quick enough to take pictures. Buyers have to know that size matters, and in order to get all this functionality you end up with a larger than average size for a point and shoot digital camera. Other than that, it's perhaps the best camera I've owned. The frequent complain on the place of the flash is not an issue once you get used to it. Plenty of ways to avoid it. It's fine, stylish and has great features you won't easily find in other compact digital cameras at this present time. A 12 MP maximum resolution is not a concern to me, the higher the resolution is, the more space will take in your computer, and higher resolutions are greatly overrated. I love the panorama mode, a 360 degrees unique in Fuji's cameras.

Hill", "ReviewID": "R2QXBFC5TYYQXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using a $600 digital Kodak SLR camera for the past 8 years and overall I've been pleased with it but it has its shortcomings and given its age, it is sadly behind in technological advances.  The gaps I'd like filled include the ability for the camera to take action shots that don't end up a blur, compensate for my shaky hands that only shake while holding a camera, and provide not only close-up options but also wide-angle so I can take great shots while at a ball game all in a compact body.The FujiFilm camera is half the size of my SLR which is an obvious plus, yet it feels substantial, although not heavy, in my hand. The camera body is mostly metal and is clearly built to survive minor mishaps. Along with the camera, packed inside the box is a well written instruction manual, a CD-ROM version of the manual and My Fine Pix Studio for Windows and Mac, a USB cable, a cable for playback with a television along with a 4 GB SDHC card and camera battery. I plan to pick up a small camera bag to protect the body, but otherwise, once the battery is charged (it was quick - no more than an hour or two) the camera is ready to use.The automatic retractable lens and flash work smoothly and quietly when the on/off button is pushed. The gracefulness of these actions is one indication of the quality of the camera. I found the controls easy to locate and use without effort. .The display on the back of the camera is large - easily three quarters the size of the entire back. The zoom control encircles the shutter button so one finger controls both functions, along with focus which is obtained by pressing the shutter button down half way. No searching for the controls, everything is well designed for ease of use.So did the camera, as advertised, adjust for shaky hands? Yes it did, although I attempted to defeat the claim by intentionally moving my hands while pressing the shutter button, and still the camera automatically adjusted and the photos were perfectly in focus.Next I tested the camera's ability to stop motion with a moving subject. Although she looks healthy, my dog is not, and time with her is limited. I've been trying to take more pictures of her, but she is camera shy and attempts an escape whenever I point a camera in her direction, so most photographs result in a blur of movement.  I pointed the FujiFilm camera at her and as usual, she dashed away, but in spite of the movement I quickly pressed the shutter and was shocked to see her image captured in focus.I selected the \"red eye\" adjustment and corrected the green reflection that showed up in her first few pictures. It worked perfectly and after that every image reflected her warm brown eyes. Did I mention she was in a dark corner?  I was impressed that no matter how dark and blurry the image on the camera's display, the actual shot was perfectly lighted and focused every time. I went outside and took a shot with the camera pointed up into the branches of an apple tree while facing directly into the sun and even that shot was adjusted for the lighting. How is that possible? Well, I guess that isn't important but this camera is amazing.The close-up and wide angle lens are a bonus in a camera this small. The camera automatically adjusts for dark lighting, movement of the subject or movement from shaky hands - it is virtually foolproof - and not in that virtually foolproof way that often means a sub-standard photograph.  This camera produces fabulous pictures in adverse conditions. This is the first camera I will grab when heading to an event, holiday celebration or vacation. It is small so it is no effort to keep it with me in my wish to capture candid shots of my dog. l have absolutely no complaints and wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy to use, very forgiving compact digital camera.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Camera, Intelligent and fast", "Author": "Nishant Agarwal", "ReviewID": "R15JI1AMRCWPY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is beautifully constructed. High quality materials with stylish finish, and contours. Attention has been given to make the camera stand out from countless other competitors in this segment. As an example, as you will see in the product photos, the dial button to select different photo modes is at an angle, I really liked this, very ergonomic.I won't again repeat the camera specifications here, that's already given in detail in product description. I will try to say how good the camera really works with those specificatons.The 15x wide angle zoom lens is absolutely working as advertised. There is very low angle distortion on the corners on the 24mm wide angle, and it's amazing how that can be achieved in compact cameras.The EXR technology mode, when selected from the dial button, automatically adjusts all settings by various sensors. I found it really technically amazing to see how the various icons and settings changed when I used camera in different situations and pointed at different places. It is very fast to sense and change. Face detection, red eye reduction, everything works, and is fast. The camera is also very fast to turn on and be ready to take photos. I am using a 4GB SDHC card. Camera focuses very fast.The image stabilization works like any other camera these days, and is good. I did notice high ISO behavior that was not excellent, but for that you need DSLR, from compact camera, this is comparable to other cameras in this segment. The flash works properly, my only gripe is that whenever camera is on, it pops up and cannot be forced down. This may become ok after some usage as you get used to it, not a show stopper for anyone I think.The camera LCD works as advertised, bright in daylight and low light, vibrant, and the icon resolutions are also nice, sometimes manufacturers make really bad icons and UI elements, but this one is good.I am no expert in photography, but it's got all the bells and whistles and all the different modes in all cameras these days. Stand out is the EXR mode which I really like, that auto adjuts all settings and selects different scene modes also. The scene mode selection is really accurate, I was amazed.Low light photography can be better, I have seen Canons and Sonys take better low light photo, in low light I noticed some graininess and less vibrance. But that may also be because I am not using the proper settings. It's not bad, but not the best in the segment. Again, not a show stopper at all.I also liked the Panorama mode to shoot upto 360 degree photo. It worked without much practice, after trying one or two times. Just keep button pressed and move around, trying to keep camera a bit steady along a line it shows on the LCD. Not difficult.I really liked the camera, it is different than others, stands out, people have asked me about it and liked it.

Had I paid for this, it would be on its way back for a refund though as the image quality is just plain bad at full resolution.Background: I'm a \"prosumer\" photographer and have a Canon Rebel SLR with various lenses for high quality shots, and a Canon PowerShot SD750 that is in my pocket for hiking, skiing and travel.  The PowerShot turns on instantly, take beautiful 7 megapixel images instantly, and lasts several days and hundreds of shots on a single charge.  But, with only a 3X optical zoom, it cannot reach very far, nor is its widest angle wide enough for home interior shots.This Fuji F300EXR's lens range is its greatest asset.  The wide angle position will satisfy realtors and home seekers and the zoom can satisfy nature and sports enthusiasts.  But, don't expect images that are as clean and full of detail as the much cheaper Canon PowerShot in spite of the 12 megapixel size of the Fuji images.  And, don't expect fast performance.  It takes about 5 seconds after you turn on the F300EXR before it is ready to take a picture, and you will at times be waiting for it to store the previous shot.I took the Fuji on a 10 day trip with my wife to the World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky and took still shots, panoramas and videos there with it, along with shots there and at home to do side by side comparisons with the cheaper, less capable Canon PowerShot.  In all cases, the Canon won - except for the ability of the Fuji to zoom in on the action.Images taken with this Fuji look very \"processed\".  Even on the \"Fine\" setting, images show strong JPEG compression artifacts when viewed at 100% in Photoshop, grass and pine needles blur, and some edges look like they've had a sharpening filter applied to them with settings that are too extreme resulting in strange contrast artifacts.  Even in full daylight photos, some regions have random dark noise in them.Note:  If you look at the images on a monitor at anything less than 100% (\"actual size\"), you may not see these issues.  In particular, when viewed at 25% or even 50%, the images look fine.  I'm sure that 4x6 prints would look fine too.  But, some of the reasons for having as many as 12 megapixels are to allow for either large prints, the ability to get a printable image from a cropped portion of the full image,  or  the ability to get full-pixel, cropped detail for the web.  If none of these is needed, then you don't need a high megapixel camera.The same images with the little PowerShot look great.  Why?  Opening and comparing images in Photoshop, each camera compresses the image down to about 12% of its full size when the least JPEG compression is selected.  (For one scene, the Canon compressed to 13.3% of original and this Fuji to 12.5% of original.)  So, compression in itself is not the problem.  I can only guess that it is a combination of whatever post-processing the Fuji does prior to storage along with the unique-to-Fuji \"EXR\" CCD sensor which lays out the red, blue and green pixels in a different arrangement than any other CCD.  See dpreview.com for technical details on this.I had high hopes for the HD video that this Fuji can record.  However, it too is burdened with noise and blurred/processed details.  That would be OK if it was only going to be compressed and uploaded to YouTube, but the camera is incapable of maintaining focus if you zoom while recording!  As I took video of horses riding in the World Equestrian Games, the camera stayed reasonably focused as I panned around the arena.  But, any time I zoomed, the camera immediately went out of focus and did not regain focus until several seconds after I stopped zooming (whether in or out).  In contrast, my little Canon PowerShot stays crisp at all times... but with its 3x optical zoom, I would not have been able to get close to the horse as I did with the Fuji.When zoomed fully, in full daylight, the image taken with the Fuji is distinctly fuzzy if viewed at 100% pixel view.  I probably should not expect more from a compact lens that can zoom to a 300mm equivalent, so just mention it. When viewed at 50% (basically reducing the 12 megapixel image to 3 megapixels), the image looks fine.The mode selection dial on the camera is a pain.  It is mounted at a 45 degree angle to the camera body, and it seemed that every time I pulled the camera out of its case, or my backpack or coat pocket, the camera was set in a different mode than where I had left it, wasting some initial shots.  I've never had a camera with this issue before.The battery life is pretty bad.  I barely got a few hours of shooting in with the Fuji the first day before the battery died.  I can shoot for days with the Canon PowerShot.  The SD card is accessed via the same door as the battery, on the bottom of the camera.  Like most compact cameras, this means you cannot access the card or battery while the camera is mounted to a tripod.The Fuji did come with a 4 GB class 6 memory card, which was nice.  The card does not eject very far as with most SD card sockets.  When you press it in, it pops out less than a quarter of an inch, and very close to the hinged door.  You need good fingernails to get the card out from there.  The camera came with a USB cable and a standard RCA video/mono sound cable.  You would need your own mini HDMI cable if you wanted to watch the video shot on the camera on your HD TV.Since all photos are JPEG (there is no option for any other format) and videos are standard AVI files, just like the Canon PowerShot, the images and videos could be viewed immediately on any computer or iPad without any additional software.The camera has lots of custom shooting modes and features that are potentially pretty cool.  But, since the basic imagery is of marginal quality, I won't make this review longer by discussing those features.To sum up:  you can find much better image quality and battery life elsewhere.  You might consider this camera if you really need the 15x optical zoom and wide angle features and you will always be making 8x10 or smaller prints or web images without major cropping.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Finepix F300EXR: small camera, big camera results", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R22G2CU9ODMBVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many compact digitals camera in what has become an excellent buyer's market today, and because of that proliferation it's sometimes difficult to choose between what's good and what's not so good.  In the case of the Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR, it's hard to go wrong with this camera, as it provides what seems to be a 'best of all worlds' set of features, and then backs it up with excellent digital results.Putting it simply, this digital camera is a five-star product.  If you want just the highlights as to why, see my Short Notes below.  If you want the full review, go to Detailed Notes further down.Short NotesPros:* Excellent overall quality, very good ergonomics* Solid and attractive black metal body shell* EXR Auto exposure mode: 3 dedicated modes* 12-megapixel resolution with EXR Super CCD technology; large print capability* 15x super-wide-angle optical zoom lens, offering a true 24mm-360mm equivalent* Large high-contrast 3.0-inch LCD viewfinder with 460k pixels* Face detection & recognition, offers up to 8 faces in the frame* Good ISO range: 100 - 12,800* SD/SDHC memory card slot (no more pricey xD cards!)* Hybrid high-speed autofocus (AF) plus tracking autofocus* Uses both Phase Detection and Contrast AF methods for AF in bright or dark conditions* Intelligent IS, uses sensor-shift and high ISO to capture blur-free photos* Motion Panorama mode sweeps up to 360\u00b0* Pro Low-Light mode* Dedicated video recording button; 720p HD video* HDMI output* Powered by a Li-ion battery pack, offering excellent battery life.Cons:* Supplied MyFinePix Studio software could be better* Lacks 'real' camera strap lugs (but most compacts like this don't)Detailed Notes:The Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR has just about everything in it that makes a good compact digital camera. It  offers performance, good design, it's easy to carry around, it's simple to use and has overall above par experience.  This camera offers a 15x zoom lens plus the ability to cover 24mm super wide angle. The zoom function is fast and functional, and the super electron beam coating on the lens offers impressive results at all focal lengths. Will try to detail the highlights that this user found to make this camera such a good choice.EXR Modes:The EXR modes, accessed from the angled dial on top, offer an orange setting labeled 'EXR' which is Fujifilm's Super CCD system, a redesigned sensor and image processor. This camera has the option of grouping pixels together in High ISO/Low Noise mode to create brighter, sharper low-light shots. High-dynamic-range images can be created within the camera, enabling you to see bright scenes and objects hiding in the shadows in the same shot. When in this mode, one can manually access EXR Auto (automatic), HR (resolution priority), SN (high-ISO & low noise), or DR (dynamic range priority) by selecting from the menu screen. For those wishing point-and-shoot automation, the EXR Auto setting will deliver excellent results. This user has had the best results from the HR mode, where the internal CCD system and internal image processor have produced some excellent results.F-Mode:The F-Mode button on the lower right of the back of the camera provides some other interesting settings. The ISO and image size settings can be accessed here, but the most interesting one may be the film simulation settings. For those of us who have use Fuji films in 35mm and larger formats, this camera does an excellent job of simulating Provia (standard color range), Velvia (vivid colors), Astia (soft, for portraits), B&W; and Sepia. All of these are surprisingly close to the silver-based films that made Fuji's films so popular with pros and advanced amateurs.Controls:The various buttons and controls are comfortably and logically located. Holding this camera feels nice and natural, allowing this user to focus on the image composition instead of fiddling. The power button and the shutter release are ergonomically located right on top, and zoom function surrounds the shutter with a small finger lever toward the front. Push it and you'll find that you've sipped from wide angle to full telephoto in about two seconds... it's that fast, yet if one takes a little time, there are slower speeds, as this zoom switch is quite variable.Lens:This is where this camera really shines with its 15x optical zoom, going from a super-wide angle to a strong telephoto (24-360mm equivalent in 35mm camera terms). All of the ranges are quite good, but at its widest (24mm equivalent) setting, this camera really shines. It's a true 84\u00b0 diagonal angle of view, making it ideal for interiors or wide scenes. Couple this wide setting with the 4000x2248 (16:9) view available, and it allows for some very dramatic results. The macro setting is on the dial on the back of the camera, and allows one to get to just under two inches away from the subject. When the camera is turned off, the lens retracts quite neatly, and the built-in lens cover protects it quite well.Ease of Use:Simply put, this camera has great ergonomics, and is a pleasure to use. Fujifilm did their homework, and this camera has come a long way from some of earlier brethren of just a few years ago. All of the controls are easily accessible, even the separate video button located on the back of the camera body.LCD Screen:The large high-contrast 3.0-inch LCD viewfinder is top notch. With its 460k pixels, its visibility is excellent, even in bright outdoor light.Other Points:The flash does a decent job, at least as well as most compact digital cameras as far as color and range go. But turn the camera on and one finds that integral flash, sunk neatly within the camera body, pops up automatically... and it stays that way. There's no lock-down on the flash head. This was a mild irritant at first, but this user finally got used to it. As far as the included MyFinePix Studio software goes, this used had it on the computer for about a day, so I'm not a good judge, preferring the various Adobe Photoshop products or the Nikon Capture NX 2 which I use with my Nikon DSLR. There's also the free Nikon ViewNX2 (google it), which provides a fast and easy way of organizing and performing minor photo editing tasks.Alternatives:There are a lot of great compact cameras available on the market today, as noted in the beginning of this review, but if you're looking for more than this model offers, this reviewer might suggest the newly-announced Fujifilm FinePix F660EXR or the even more feature loaded Fujifilm FinePix F770EXR. Both of these are evolutionary products which came from FinePix F300EXR beginnings. Another proven camera might be the Nikon Coolpix P7100 Digital Camera with its 3-Inch Vari-Angle LCD, one that this reviewer has used extensively.In Conclusion...Must admit that my FinePix F300EXR, received as part of my Amazon Vine selections, turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. Had been considering a costly Nikkor lens for my Nikon DSLR to cover the 24mm super-wide range when I received it, and to put it bluntly, never bought the lens: the FinePix F300EXR proved itself to be good enough for wide-angle imaging that I never had to bother. Have posted a few photos here in the images with the results that I've obtained with this camera. This one is highly recommended, as are the others in the Fujifilm FinePix EXR-series of cameras.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Handy and powerful little camera", "Author": "M.

I decided to do some research.  The first camera I saw had settings for HDTV, but no HDMI hook-ups.  That started me on a quest for the best camera for my money.I did a comparison search, and found the Fujifilm FinePix F300 EXR in a line-up with four or five other cameras.  My camera was not their first pick, but I did more research.  It had everything I wanted including an HDMI cable capabilities.  I am so happy with the 15x zoom.  You can really frame your shots the way you like.  Some others have 14MP, but no 15x optical zoom.  I'll take the optical zoom.  Avoid digital zoom at all costs.  It loses clarity quickly.After more consideration, I found it on Amazon.com for a great price!  It has the point and shoot capabilities with three different settings. There is an Auto setting, a Programmed Auto as well as an EXR setting.  The latter is powerful.The camera has an auto-release function that finds and shoots faces automatically.  My five-month-old grandson is always on the move in his little gym.  My FinePix took the pictures when he was looking at the camera with eyes open.  I didn't even have to hold the shutter.  It releases when a portrait subject appears in the lens.  What a deal!  You can find it when you push the dial down.There is a Scene Position (SP) setting menu.  There you find the 2 shots for natural and flash settings.  It shoots both at once, and you can choose to save one or both.  In the scenes mode you can set the camera to find the faces of a dog or cat.  The auto mode is the point and shoot mode, and gives clear pictures with little thought on my part.The usual settings for manual, aperture, and shutter priorities.  There is a macro setting, and most interesting of all a panorama setting.  You can shoot in your chosen path in an arc and make a panorama right in the camera!The EXR auto mode goes a bit further.  It chooses the best scenes, optimizes things like dynamic range.  That is where the picture brings out the detail in the highlights.  You can choose the Resolution Priority for the clearest shots.  You can set EXR for Resolution Priority, High ISO & Low Noise, or D-Range Priority.  I took pictures in the High ISO and Low Noise setting, and the pictures had plenty of detail.  Finally, the D-Range priority (dynamic range) is used to increase the details in the highlights.  (I did not know what it was for on my Nikon.  This little piece of knowledge could have saved some of my shots.)The Scene Position has the usual scenes, like landscape, snow, etc. In addition, there is a useful Scene Position that takes two shots of the same subject--faster than you can blink an eye.  One is without flash and the other is with flash.  Then you choose the one you like.  In my case, I took both because the pictures were of my 5 month-old great-grandson.There is even a setting for quick focus when you are shooting sports events, and fast moving little ones.  ;)  There is a Scene Position setting to make text more crisp.  What will they think of next!The Power Management has three settings.  One to save the battery, one for quick focus, and one for a clear LCD.  I use the quick focus most of the time.The macro setting is powerful and easy to use.  I could go on and on.  I really like this small camera.  It fits in your pockets very nicely.  Yet it feels very substantial. It has a metal body, and just enough weight to feel like you can hold it still.  The dual anti-shake system is superb.  The only motion I have gotten was from my subjects--before I discovered the Auto Release setting which I mentioned above.It is interesting that they call this a point and shoot camera!  Bah humbug!  It is a powerful camera that fits in your hand and your pocket.  It's low light performance is not what the expensive SLRs can do, but it is acceptable.  Actually, I have found that when you read the directions and set it properly, it does a great job indoors in incandescent light.I have one caution.  It is a good idea to look in the basic manual to see how to hold the camera.  Before I read the basic manual, I turned the camera on.  My hands covered the flash and almost impeded the zoom lens.  I am used to holding a larger camera.  Now I hold my Fujifilm camera like it shows in the picture.As for movies, nothing beats a dedicated movie camera.  It takes good movies of the children.  For a sports event, you might want to take a digital camcorder.  I will be sure to take my FinePix for the stills.  The movies and still pictures look great on my HDTV. I purchased an HDMI cable through Amazon.com.One thing I have not tried is the burst types of shots.  They are available in the FinePix and no doubt I will try them out.  My Nikon SLR does them quite nicely.  I don't expect to take it on vacations, to the zoo, or use it for spur of the moment shots of the children.  I will still use my Nikon for landscapes around here.Happy camera hunting.

Means", "ReviewID": "R3A3XNWKRQSZ4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera. It is the 4th digital camera I have owned, and about the 10th that I have used. This one is the best! I comes with a basic printed manual that had me taking my first few pictures within less than 5 minutes. I suggest that as soon as you get this camera the first thing you do is to charge the battery since the odds are it will be low. I comes with a battery charger. In fact, it comes with many niceties that some camera manufacturers might charge extra for - not the least of which is an additional 4GB memory card! It also came with the cable necessary to connect to a PC, and a cable that allows connection to a TV. Pictures and movies can be viewed on a TV easily using it.The quality of the colors produced when taking a still picture is excellent! Much superior to any other camera I've ever owned. The 12MB resolution is also excellent giving one the ability to zoom many times a picture to examine detail while still having a very sharp focus. Also, I love that it automatically senses when it is necessary to focus for a macro (close-up) shot of something. But, to get even better close-ups, there is a simple setting and it works great! The resolution that I got when taking an extreme close-up was much better than I expected. When viewed on my computer, and then zoomed, I could make out very very fine details.The camera can make movies. I found that it uses roughly 200MBs of memory storage for a movie that is 1 minute long with 24 frames/second and has a frame width of 1280 x frame height of 720.  The file is saved as a .AVI filetype. When played back on my HDTV or on my computer (a 24 inch LCD monitor) the resolution is pretty good but not as good as what you would see playing back a standard DVD using the cable provided with the camera. I do not yet have the HDMI cable to compare the quality using that technology. One thing that I really like is that the camera is continuously focusing as I move the camera around to point to different things. I should also point out that the microphone does an excellent job of recording the sound while filming. It is quite sensitive and I can hear subtle noises in the background.This camera offers the ability to take a 360 degree picture while moving it left, right, or up/down through 360 degrees (or less). I was able to get a very good result which surprised me since I'm sure I didn't do a very good job holding the camera steady or even at the same level as I rotated in a circle! It took me a few attempts to take such a picture successfully since the camera expects the picture to be taken while rotating at a particular speed. This is easy to master however since the display lets you know what it expects.This camera has numerous capabilities and settings. Learning them all requires some time. But, it is very simple to take basic pictures and movies amost immediately using the default settings. In addition to the printed manual, it also comes with a 130 page detailed manual that is in PDF format for viewing on a computer. The manual is well written and illustrated. Additionally, when using the camera it shows lots of helpful tips in the display as you change from one setting to another.It also comes with some nice software that allows you to copy pictures from the camera to your computer, to edit pictures, manage picture libraries, and to transfer your pictures to websites like Facebook and YouTube. Among the standard editing capabilities (like fixing a shot too dark or too bright, red-eye, etc) it allows for some cool special effects. These effects include: Inverting colors to appear as a negative, Mosaic - Divides thie picture into many small tiles, Swirling the picture, making it appear as an oil painting, and more. I can tell you that they work well too. In particular, a couple of my shots were quite dark, but clicking on a single option fixed it to near perfection.If you already have nice photo editing/management software you may not want to install this. It is not necessary - at least not if you have Windows 7 which is what I use. I can easily access the camera as though it was a drive and copy/delete files like any other drive using windows explorer.Overall, I have come to the conclusion that this camera is excellent and highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "F300 - great for what I want it for - and lots of bang for the buck", "Author": "R. Kuo", "ReviewID": "R19GNMT2NKL1VX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reviews tend to be either 5 stars or 1 star -- love it or hate it. After a month of heavy use and a tough learning curve, I think there still hasn't been a review which tells it the way I've seen it. Hopefully this will help others with their decision. First a word about where I'm coming from: I started with a Sony W1 six years ago, moved into a Fujifilm F11 (loved it!) and got a Canon DSLR XSi with the 18-55/55-250 zoom combo after my daughter started running around. I still have both the F11 and the Canon, which both take great pics, with the F11 for pocketability. But I wanted a more pocketable camera with more zoom.The best thing about the camera for me.. is the 15x zoom. Wow, I can sit at the playground on a bench and get a close-up at the top of the slide. 15x magnification is meaningful, and almost matches the Canon at 250mm with the crop factor. But also.. the camera focuses and reacts FAST. Of course, I also selected \"performance\" over \"battery life\" in the configurations, but it's such a pleasure to use then. Focus is fast, whether using the phase detection or not, and I have even captured birds and planes in flight, unthinkable with the F11 and hard enough with the Rebel. This applies to the camera once on of course, start up time is normal. The stabilization seems to be very good -- if you have used a 360mm equivalent lens before you will love that you can take pictures at 1/10 of a second at full zoom.What may be a deal-breaker for you: The F300 is different from other cameras. The \"noise\" looks different. The sample pic from another user with his car is typical at 800 ISO, unfortunately. But.. there are ways around it. I limit photos in decent lighting to ISO 400, since more than that invites extra noise. I also tend to frame the shot when I shoot it, and don't crop much. That is important, because if you want to crop, you will see noise unless you are outside in very good light. Then again, this is a compact camera, I don't expect miracles either. What may matter to you too: It's not an easy camera to master. It has many options, some more meaningful than others. Coming from a DSLR, I learned to \"eyeball\" the exposure of a scene and that has proved very useful with the F300, since the automatic is not as smart as it should be. If you know how to tweak a camera, you'll get a lot more out of this camera. Luckily exposure is easy to adjust and unlike the F11 it has a true manual mode. If you only rely on fully-automatic settings, then at least limit it to ISO 400 or 800 and then just start shooting and you should be all right too.As for me, I went through the gamut-- I wanted to return it after one day (one star), but decided to test it more thoroughly and am really appreciating it now. I read about the settings on the DPReview forum and tested them out. They helped a lot. I also had the chance to borrow my brother's new Lumix LX5 (great cam) and shoot the F300 side-by-side. My verdict indoors where the Lumix's f2-lens was a clear advantage? I had just as many keepers from each camera, just in different situations. The Lumix was much better in dim light, no comparison. But the F300 got the shot off when my daughter was running around, so it was faster. The image quality was also better on the Lumix indoors generally, but I didn't \"capture the moment\" with the Lumix. The F300 is a compact-camera which is quick enough to keep up with fast targets. Yes, there is some noise on those pictures, but I also could have lugged the XSi around to get better picture quality. Actually, I need the \"perfect\" camera with has the pocketability and \"fast\" lens of the Lumix and the total control of a DSLR. Until that camera is made, the F300 is a great \"carry-around\" camera and hard to beat on speed and flexibility.Two other things I liked: the \"pro\" low-light function works well for non-moving subjects, it's great in museums. With that mode you get very clean pictures (but it combines 4 pics so it really has to be non-moving). If you want even cleaner pictures, just put it on a tripod (or a table) and set it to ISO 100, that still works too. Also the 24mm wide angle is great. It takes a while to get used to, and you don't want to put people on the edges of the picture, well not people you like, anyways.BTW the video was a disappointment, at least the focusing was. When in focus it's fine and focusing seems to work best at 24mm or on still objects at close range. But don't get this camera if you *need* great video or are planing on shooting a lot of video, it's not a camcorder. 720p works great when the focus works.So far I used the camera in museums, at the playground, at a professional soccer game, in the city, indoors, outdoors in nature in the woods in shadow and in harsh light (the EXR mode does its magic). It handled it all pretty well, but again, that applies to my style of shooting and after I got used to using it. As a final note: I used to tote the DSLR a lot when going for walks. It has stayed at home for a month and I haven't missed it. The F300 doesn't challenge a DSLR, but the best camera is the one you have with you, and this one is easy to carry around and gets you a pretty good picture to boot.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality Flaw - Dial Mode Icons rubbed off", "Author": "Anne", "ReviewID": "R333ZUHV7ARAAW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the camera at first but after using it for 2 days I went to select a different shooting mode but the icons had rubbed off the \"Mode Dial\".

I have gotten many more blurry shots with this camera than I do with my Rebel and that may be just because I'm not used to working with such a small camera and will probably improve over time.There's no viewfinder on this camera so your only option for framing your photos is to use the view screen. The zoom lever is a bit clunky and not very sensitive to the touch so it's a bit difficult to find the middle ground with the zoom setting.The software bundled with this camera is not the best.  The image editor lets you do the basics such as crop, adjust lighting, contrast, and gives you a few different effects to apply like negative, hue, haze, water-colour etc but if you want to do any serious photo editing you'll definitely want to have a better program for it.It doesn't come with a printed manual other than the quick start guide.

I am reposting that here also, in its entirety, because it contains quite a lot of info in the F300EXR too, and thus may also be of some interest to folks looking at the F300EXR.)-=-=-=-Hummm... where to begin.  I'm a very experienced amateur photographer.  My dad and I used to develop and print our own color film & prints in our basement darkroom, back 40 years ago when essentially zero amateurs even attempted this. I even worked for a short while (and got paid) as a photographer.  (But that also was a long time ago.)  Still, I know my way around a camera.I've owned several different film cameras in my life, but sold off the last one a few years ago because I could see the handwriting on the wall.  My first digital was an Olympus C-5000, which was nice, but only 5mp.  It had a couple of special features that I really miss.  I'll come back to those.  After that I got myself an Olympus SP-570UZ, in part because that is the ONLY model in the Olympus SP line that actually had a hotshoe for external flash.  I'll come back to that too.So anyway, recently I knew that I was going to be taking two trips, one of which was a rather challenging hike in Yosemite, so I decided to get myself something really compact and light.  Lucky for me I found not one by two big-zoom pocket compacts on sale as open box items in Amazon marketplace at ridiculous low prices.  (They have probably fired the guy who listed those by now, because really I got these both dirt cheap.)The first one I ordered was a Fuji Finepix F300EXR... basically last year's model, open box, at a knock down price.  This is another shirt-pocket big zoom compact (15x zoom, 12mp, 3.0\" LCD).  Then I saw the Lumix DMC-ZS7 (black)... also last year's model... on Amazon as a open box for an even more ridiculously low price, so I said \"what the hell\" and bought that one too, intended to return one of the other, depending on which one I liked best.  (I am a big fan of buying last year's model of anything and everything.  No matter what it is, this year's model is always overpriced, because all companies know that they can gouge the \"early adopters\".)So I got both and ran a few trivial picture quality comparisons and for both outdoor and indoor the DMC-ZS7 was quite clearly superior in terms of picture quality.  (I *did not* actually make any \"low light\" tests.  I feel obliged to mention that because the marketing materials for the Fuji assert that it gives markedly superior low-light performance.  I have not really checked this claim and thus can't say, one way or the other.)Both of these cameras are 12 megapixel models, but as I say, my own test shots, when displayed side-by-side on my monitor left no doubt.  Image quality was superior on the ZS7... perhaps not all that surprising of a result, given that the original MSRP at release was about a hundred bucks higher for the ZS7 versus the F300EXR.Size and weight of both cameras is essentially identical.  Both/either fit quite comfortably in a shirt pocket or a jeans pocket.  (Because these were my first ultra-compacts, I wasn't sure that would be true until I received them.)  Both are about the size of a pack of cigarettes, but a bit longer and only just barely thicker.  Both cameras have outer skins that are mostly metal, with some plastic trim here and there.  Both feel quite solid and build quality of both appears to my eye to be excellent.The F300EXR has slightly longer zoom (15x versus 12x) but given the choice, I'll take the better image quality over that extra zoom length.  Both cameras have nice 3.0 inch high-res LCDs, and both of those are sharp as a tack.  Both can take 720p high-res movies, and both have HDMI outputs.  (These were two features I really wanted.)  Both cameras come with essentially identical standard accessories, AV cable, USB cable, manual(s), software disks, and writs strap.  Both provide at least a modicum of manual controls... something else I definitely wanted... as well as shutter & aperture priority modes.Controls on both cameras are comfortable and, for the most part, intuitive.  The F300EXR has a kind of outer ring around the normative North/South/East/West/OK button set, and in playback and other contexts this is helpful.  The ZS7 doesn't have that, and to make matters worse the \"legend\", i.e. symbols indicating the function, that are on each of the North/South/East/West buttons pn the ZS7 are simply engraved into the tiny shiny metal buttons, making them very nearly impossible to even read in dim light (or actually impossible if I don't have my reading glasses on).The F300EXR power switch is push-down type, whereas on the ZS7 it is a slider switch.  (I prefer the latter.) On the F300EXR, the only way to playback is to power on (causing the lens to extend and the flash to pop up) and THEN press the playback button to switch to playback mode  This is clearly wasteful of time & battery power.  The ZS7 has a more sensible slider switch which can be set to either recording or playback mode BEFORE you slide the power switch to ON.As has been noted elsewhere, the F300EXR flash pops up and stays up whenever the power is on, and unfortunately, it is right win the spot where you are most likely to rest your left index finger. (You DO hold your cameras with both hands, right?)  By popping up, the F300EXR's flash maybe gets a tiny bit further from the lens (thus reducing red eye?) but I doubt this \"feature\" really buys you much.  The flash on the ZS7 is just there on the front of the camera.  No pop-up action.  Anyway, the pop-up flash on the F300EXR is not really annoying, just a bit surprising sometime when you power on and feel a little pushing up under your left index finger.On the ZS7, I noted that my left index finger sort-of naturally came to rest often on the upper left front corner of the camera.  That's not a problem until the camera wants to use the infrared thingy to help with auto-focus, at which point your'll note immediately that you need to move your left index finger slightly to get it out of the way of the infrared.The menu system of the F300EXR is quite good. It's clear, easy to read, dark-gray/light-gray superimposed over whatever would otherwise be displayed on the LCD at the moment.  The menu system of the ZS7, yellow-on-white, didn't seem quite as nice to me, but both/either will get the job done.  One major irritant with both of these that could easily be rectified by the manufacturers is a missing feature that I have on my Olympus SP-570UZ, i.e. built-in verbose help pages/screens within the menu system.  On the SP-570UZ, if you don't understand or are not sure about the function of some setting or another, you are just one tap away from a very helpful verbose English language description of the function of that setting.  It's almost like carrying a condensed/abridged version of the manual around with you, only better.  Why all digital cameras don't have this feature is beyond me.  It really doesn't take up much memory OR require much programming and even the simplest digital cameras nowadays are so complex and have so many features and functions that most have manuals that go on for more than 100 pages.  Are we supposed to MEMORIZE all that before sallying forth into the field to take pictures??  I think not.  So put it in the camera!  That way we can't lose it, like that bleedin' lens cap we haven't seen in the last five years.The super deluxe let-me-do-it-all-for-you point-and-shoot automatic-everything modes on both cameras produced generally excellent results in a variety of situations and conditions.  To my eye, auto-focus, auto-exposure, and auto white balance on both cameras pretty much always produced acceptable results, however as I've said, I am old-school, and where \"auto with aperture priority\" on small cameras such as these, where you can't really get thin depth of field no matter what you do (because the lenses are just too tiny), seem like an entirely useless/superfluous setting, I did feel the need to try auto with shutter priority on both cameras for various shots, just to keep the respective \"intelligent\" auto modes from mucking up the shot with excessively optimistic shutter speeds that wouldn't actually work in practice, especially handheld, towards the long ends of the zoom ranges.Battery life on both the F300EXR and the ZS7 was beyond excellent, and seemed to me to be well beyond what you would ever need for any one sitting OR even for an entire short vacation.  I mean who on earth takes 250+ shots in one sitting?  I'm an old-school guy who grew up on film cameras and who always had to worry about running out of film.  8GB SDHC cards are dirt cheap, so if you get one of those, then really, in the modern digital era, the only thing you ever really need to worry about running out of is battery power.  But as I say, with these cameras it seems like you don't even really need to worry about that much either.  I'm paranoid, so I bought an extra (cheaper than Panasonic) third-party spare battery for the ZS7, and now I feel like an idiot for having done so, because really, I doubt that I'll ever even use it.  I took about 100 shots on an all-day hike in Yosemite and I still had plenty of power left at the end of the day.  Today I did my 31+ minute test movie, and even that didn't move the needle on the battery charge indicator... a rather surprising result given that modern video compression is known to be rather CPU (and power) intensive.The two Olympus cameras I had before I bought these two shirt-pocket compacts were straightforward to get pictures and movies from, even when I was plugging them into my UNIX system.  Both cameras just acted like a USB drive, with a FAT filesystem and so forth, and both could be \"mounted\" as a drive on UNIX or even,,, yecch... Windoze.  I assumed that all digital cameras behaved this way nowadays, but I was disappointed to learn that the F300EXR doesn't work this way.  Instead, it speaks some protocol called PTP.  In order to get stuff directly off the camera (from FreeBSD) I was going to have to load some additional software and diddle several system settings.  Blecch. I never did.  Instead I just bought myself a cheapie SD/SDHC card reader.  Problem solved.  On the other hand, the ZS7 _does_ behave just like a USB drive, so I could just plug it in, mount it as a drive, and start pulling stuff off.  I like that.  It's simple.The ZS7 has three features that definitely set it apart from the Fuji F300EXR, i.e. GPS, stereo sound recording, and the ability to record movies with some modern flavor of data compression, specifically AVCHD.  Personally, I don't give a flying fig about the GPS.  It's been set to off since I got the camera.  (I _do_ already know what city I am in, thank you very much.)  If I can ever figure out how to get actual GPS _coordinates_ out of the ZS7, and not just city names, then I will think that the GPS might have some usefulness, e.g. for the unlikely day I am lost in the forest with a satellite phone and need to tell my rescuers where I am.  But as I have so far not seen any setting on the ZS7 that would give me raw GPS hours/minutes/seconds coordinates, I still don't see the GPS feature as being at all useful, even with the GPS picture-tagging feature. I mean hey!  If I have a shot of Half Dome, I think I can remember that I took in in Yosemite.  If I'm looking at a shot I took of the Eiffel Tower... well... umm... DUH!  GPS is obviously just one of those techno bells and whistles that camera designers add just because they can, cheaply, and because the guys in the marketing departments think that it sounds techno-cool.  There are at least half a dozen OTHER features that could be added to these kinds of cameras for one tenth the cost and that would actually help people to take better pictures, but those ones don't seem to make it into the designs for some reason.  (See rant below.)The ability to record stereo sound is likewise rather superfluous, in my opinion.  I mean seriously, you have two microscopic microphones and they are sitting about 1/2 inch from one another.  Do we really think that the left and right are going to hear anything significantly different from the other?  If you do, then I have a bridge to sell you.Lastly, the modern video compression and the AVCHD recording format actually were and are things that I really cared/care about and want/wanted. I just now did a 30+ minute 720p/30 test recording on the ZS7.  (Yes, apparently the ZS7 _does not_ have the seemingly arbitrary 29 point something minute per movie time limit that some other digital cameras I've read about have.)  Anyway, my little 31+ minute ZS7 720p/30fps test recording came out to just over 3.6GB on the SDHC card.  That seems to me to be not too shabby, but as this is the first and only digital camera I've ever owned that can record HD or even SD movies, I really have nothing to compare it against.  Oops!  Wait a minute!  I almost forgot the F300EXR!OK so I did a 720p/24fps test recording using the F300EXR.  I just shot for about 11 minutes.  The resulting (AVI aka \"motion JPEG\") file size came out to about 1.25GB.  So ummm... hummm... maybe the newer fancy schmancy compression of AVCHD ain't all that big of an advantage, filesize-wise, after all.  I mean if you ignore the fact that one camera (ZS7) was recording 30 frames per second and the other one (F300EXR) was only recording 24fps, then the file sizes divided by the length of the recordings actually seem to come out to a fairly comparable number for either camera (and/or either type of compression used), i.e somewhat over 1GB per ten minutes of 720p recording.  BUT WAIT!  We need to consider the relative quality of the recordings also. I'll discuss and compare that below.I should note also that for my two test movie recordings for the ZS7 and the F300EXR I had the cameras on a tripod, pointed in a fixed direction into my backyard, and there was no zooming.  Many ducks and Canada geese wandered in and out of the frame during the recording, but other than that, the subject matter was certainly highly redundant/compressible.  In short, if I had done these test recordings by just pointing the camera out of the side of a moving train, I think I could safely bet that the resulting video files would have been substantially bigger than these ones actually came out to be.Oh!  Did I mention that both the F300EXR and the ZS7 allow zooming during movies?  (On the ZS7 you don't hear the zooming at all on the recording, but on the F300EXR you do, but just a little.)As I alluded to above, both the ZS7 and the F300EXR can be connected to your big modern flat screen TV via a special HDMI cable.  Neither camera ships with one of these, but the cables can be had for a few bucks each off Amazon.  (Do I need to warn you to make sure you order the Right Kind for your specific camera?)The ZS7 shoots all movies resolutions, including 720p, at 30 frames per second.  The ZS7 gives a choice of recording in \"motion JPEG\" (AVI?) format, AVCHD format, or AVCHD format annotated with GPS info. The F300EXR shoots 720p only a 24 frames per second and will record only in motion JPEG (AVI) format. AVCHD definitely should, in theory at least, provide better and more modern compression and thus considerably smaller movie files.  But see below.My short 720p test recordings on the ZS7, when played back via my LG BD370 and Samsung 42 inch 720p plasma were OK, but not what I would call stunning as regards to clarity.  Close ups of a cat in the garden who wasn't moving all that much were, ummm, acceptable, but it appears to me that when some of the branches (and leaves) of my local oak tree were in the shot, and when the leaves were moving on account of a passing breeze, or when I was panning or zooming, the complexity of the images was pushing the outer envelope of the video compression and/or the recording bit rate.  The oak leaves definitely did not appear to me to be crystal clear.  If you are not too critical, the the ZS7 will do just fine at 720p/30/ACVHD for your cat, your kids, or your family barbecue, and will definitely produce results that are likely better than any standard-def videocam, if only just.I, for one, have never been a believer in the advantages of 1080 over 720 HD.  Unless you routinely sit two feet away from your big flat screen with one of those 8 1/2 x 11 Fresnel sheet magnifiers, you are really never going to notice any advantage of 1080 over 720.  For me, even my local stations, when viewed in 720p on my Samsung 720p plasma are sharp as a tack. 1080 HD is mostly just a marketing thing designed to separate consumers from their excess money.I mention all this only because I want you to know that if you are expecting \"broadcast quality\" 720p from either the ZS7 or the F300EXR you ARE going to be disappointed.  These pockatable cameras are just not going to give you the same clarity as a dedicated professional videocam costing 50 times as much.  But like I say, these cameras will still give you acceptable video of the family barbecue. (These kinds of higher-end pocket digital cameras are really the modern equivalent of the old family 8mm camera of bygone days... but actually a bit less sharp, I'm sad to report.)All that being said, the 720p/24fps recordings created by the F300EXR were definitely and obviously not in the same class as the 720p/30fps test recordings I did with the ZS7.  And no, I do not think that this was just a matter of the difference in the frame rate.  The test recordings from the ZS7 definitely appeared as if they had been shot with higher resolution, relative to the test recordings produced by the F300EXR.  But don't get too excited.  As I said above, neither of these cameras produces anything that could be mistaken for \"broadcast quality\" 720p.  Still, in comparable 720p recordings, the ZS7 produces unambiguously and noticeably sharper and clearer results, relative to the F300EXR.  (But I would be happy to take either camera, any day, and by a country mile, over any cellphone-cam.)Other points on video recording...The F300EXR apparently has a \"feature\" (aka bug) in the audio recording.  I noticed this when I did some test recording in my backyard.  Whenever the ducks and geese got really quiet and when the traffic noise from the nearby major arterial subsided, and when there were no planes overhead, in short when things got mostly quiet, the F300EXR apparently invoked some sort of demented auto level adjustment algorithm that causes the recording to go dead quiet, at least until the actual sound you are recording picks up a bit again.  On playback, these dead quiet periods were really noticeable, and seemed, well, odd.  The ZS7 has no such mis-feature.I really wanted the ACVHD recording feature of the ZS7 because I have both an older Panasonic Blu-Ray player (DMP-BD60) and also a medium old LG Blu-Ray player (BD370) that both claimed to be  able to play ACVHD, and I wanted to see if I could record some stuff in ACVHD format, burn it to a DVD, and then play it on one or both of these Blue-Ray players.  Well, I can now report that I _have_ been able to do exactly this.  I took two short 720p test recordings made in the ACVHD mode on the ZS7, used the software that came with the ZS7, copied the recordings to the hard drive on my Windoze7 system, and then used the software that came with the ZS7 to burn both recordings to a single DVD, and then popped that into my LG BD370, and it just worked, with even a little top-level menu that allowed me to select which of the two test recordings to play.  That's the good news.The bad news is that it was almost impossible to do all this because of at least a couple of really atrocious bugs in the Panasonic PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD software that came with the camera.  The worst of these bugs was that on Windows7, at least, critical buttons like \"next\" and \"back\" and \"ok\" and \"abort\" that appear at various points during interaction with the software *are not even readable*!!  I'm not kidding.  The titles that should appear on these buttons actually display as black characters on a black background!!  So I ended up having to look at the PDF of the camera manual, and at its screen shots of the software in operation, in order to deduce which of the several completely black buttons on the screen was actually the \"back\" button, which one was the \"next\" button, and so forth.  Without the camera's PDF manual and its screen shots, the PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD  software would have been totally un-navigable and thus totally useless, and I would not have been able to get my ACVHD recordings off the SDHC card OR subsequently burn them onto a DVD. In short, PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD is seriously broken.  I groped around for a long time on Panasonic's web site and eventually found a version 5.2, downloaded it and tried to install it and the install process failed with some utterly mysterious and entirely uninformative error message.  De-installing 5.1 before trying to install 5.2 made no difference.  (Panasonic needs to hire some monkeys to test their camera-external software.  Even a monkey could see that both PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 and PHOTOfunStudio 5.2 have critical flaws.)  At the time of this writing I don't even know yet whether I will be able to even reinstall the 5.1 version successfully or not.  At least I could get it to burn my ACVHD movies onto DVDs, albeit only while working around the unlabeled back/next/etc. buttons.  But I can't even get 5.2 to install!  Even stranger, Panasonic's web site talks about various 6.x versions of this same PHOTOfunStudio software, but I'll be bleeped if I can even find where they might be hiding those versions on their web server, let alone anything on the Panasonic web site that says what the differences might be between the different versions OR anything which lists which versions are compatible with which Lumix camera models.)(NOTE: The ONLY reason I am giving the ZS7 four rather than five stars is because of all of these unforgivable external software snafus.)Just a few final complaints about the Fuji F300EXR the ZS7, and probably every other pockatable digital camera currently on the market... (begin rant mode).Firstly, I know these things are already both tiny and packed to the rafters with internal guts, but seriously, how hard would it be for thje manufacturers to add a little optical or digital viewfinder, or alternatively, in the absence of that, to make and sell a reasonably priced thing that fits over the LCD, shades it, and provides a small lens with a diopter adjustment?  Despite the marketing hype, these LCDs are utterly useless in the presence of bright sun.  You just can't frame a shot with the sun behind you.  Just as importantly, it seems that everybody who designs these kinds of pocketable digitals is under the age of 45.  I say that because obviously, not a single one of them knows the first thing about presbyopia.  I am over 45, have presbyopia (like everybody else my age) and I can't be talking with my friends, ten feet in front of me, and then look down at the LCD on my camera, one foot in front of my face, and see it other than as a big blur, at least until I put my reading glasses back on, by which time I have missed the moment AND the shot.  This sucketh. I've seen shade thingies on sale that fit over 3 inch LCDs and have little diaopter adjustable lenses, and these would be perfect for people like me and our pocket cameras, but alas, these things are mostly sold to the DSLR crowd and thus cost and arm and a leg.  SOMEBODY should make and sell them for $19.95 (please?)  That would still yield a 10,000% profit over manufacturing cost.My (now ancient) Olympus C-5000 had a little optical viewfinder.  That proves that it can be done, and indeed, that technology is actually regressing in some ways.  the C-5000 had a viewfinder and that was 6+ years ago!  This new generation of pockatable cameras, unlike my C-5000 from 6 years ago, are (a) useless in bright sun and (b) semi-useless to the 99.9% of people over age 45 who need/use reading glasses.Another useful feature that my old C-5000 had that I seriously miss, and that I'm 100% sure would be dirt cheap to add to this current generation of pocket cameras was a tiny little infrared remote control.  2-second and 10-second delay timers just don't cut it if you want to get in the shot with all your pals AND have time to compose yourself and smile your best smile.  Also, I want to be able to set my camera on the other side of the garden and then fire it remotely from inside the house when and if I see some wildlife passing right in front of it.  Again, technology is regressing.  I had a remote control 6+ years ago.  Now I don't. :-(  Why?  They are cheap to make and the IR camera sensor already has to be there anyway, for the IR-based auto-focus assist.More absent features...It's too bad the designers of the current generation of pockatables are all boxed into the amateur \"snapshot\" mindset.  I guess that we should be grateful that they at least include tripod mounts on these cameras, even if only as an afterthought.  But come on!  If you are going to build a camera with a tripod mount, then it is almost idiotic that the user can't even tell the whole \"intelligent auto\" fly-by-wire almost-artificial-intelligence master brain/computer that \"Hey! We are tripod mounted now, so you, camera-brain, can automagically select slower shutter speeds and thus, correspondingly lower auto-computed ISO settings (for less noise).\"  In short, there should be a \"tripod mounted\" setting which will modify the settings selected by the \"intelligent auto\" system. (It doesn't count as \"intelligent\" if the camera doesn't know what even the stupidest human knows, i.e. that the camera is tripod mounted and thus more stable and jitter-free.)  In a similar/related vein, why can't these designers of pockatable cameras include some facility for plugging in the electronic equivalent of a good old fashioned shutter-release cable, you know, for when you are tripod mounted AND when you want to do shutter release without even touching... or jiggling... the camera?  I was able to buy a cheapie third-party \"electronic\" shutter-release thingy for my semi-old SP-570UZ and it worked like a charm and was dirt cheap.  It plugs into the SP570UZ's USB connector, so no extra precious camera surface area was needed in the design of this on the camera side.  This is SOOOOOO technically trivial, and yet so useful to anybody who really cares about getting a rock-solid non-blurred shot that it is a travesty for ANY digital camera not to have support for this kind of optional external accessory.  I mean it's like buying an expensive BMW and then looking down where the cigarette lighter should be and just seeing an empty hole.  Dumb.  Really dumb.More stuff I wish I could have...Connectors:  Now that these pockatable cameras are getting big zooms and other higher-end features, how about thinking outside of the box and providing just some cheap/easy but potentially extremely useful connectors, specifically (a) a good old fashioned flash \"sync cord\" socket and/or (b) a micro phone jack / TRS jack where an external stereo microphone could be plugged in?  Either of these would be technically trivial and dirt cheap to add, so how about it manufacturers?You manufacturers really don't have to worry about these extra features causing \"cannibalization\" of your higher-end (and more expensive) DSLR or super-zoom bridge camera lines for the simple reason that the markets for these things are just plain DIFFERENT MARKETS.  Anybody planning a trip deep into the amazon rain forest and who wants the best photos he can get IS going to buy a DSLR, no matter what nice little tweaks he can get on a pocket portable.  Conversely, anybody going into the jungle and who just wants some snapshots to take home is NOT going to spring for a DSLR or an expensive bridge camera... or be willing to carry the extra weight... just so he can get an external mic jack or an electronic shutter release.  Different markets.  'nuff said.Here endith the lesson.Other than the above nits, I actually love both the F300EXR and the ZS7.  They are both stunning and phenomenal pieces of engineering.  But of the two, the ZS7 is the one I will be keeping.P.S. One other small nit about digital cameras generally and the ZS7 and F300EXR specifically. All the digital cameras I've ever owned, including these two news ones are all apparently too stupid to even know which way is up.  Literally.  Can't you manufacturers fix this??  iPhones seem to always know which way is up, so why can't all digital cameras?(Like many of the comments above, the following comments are addressed to the camera manufacturers.)Look, this is very simple guys.  Every JPEG file has a built-in orientation and thus, a built in \"upper left\" corner.  So why is it that when I take my digital camera and orient it vertically, you know, as in \"portrait\" orientation versus \"landscape\" orientation, and then I take a shot and then load the JPEG onto my PeeCEE and then try and view the thing, the picture shows up on my screen lying on its side, rather than oriented properly?  This is definitely YOUR FAULT for not writing the JPEG file in way so that it will have proper (gravity based?) orientation.This is beyond stupid, particularly because I know for a fact that both the ZS7 and the F300EXR do in fact know which way is up, and they just aren't using that information properly.  I know they know which way is up, because in default factory settings on both, when I play back any JPEG that was shot \"portrait\" (vertical) it shows on the LCD in ``proper'' orientation, i.e. holding the camera normally (horizontal orientation) and then playing back a vertical-orientation shot, these cameras re-orient the images so that they appear on the LCDs vertically, and with big wide black bands on either side.  To accomplish this, obviously both cameras must be adding some sorts of annotations to all JPEGs they produce which indicate whether the shot was taken horizontally or vertically.  So the cameras do know which was is \"up\" for any given shot.  And they even save notes about that for each shot/JPEG.  Unfortunately, both cameras are too dumb to simply arrange for the JPEGs themselves to be oriented properly, based on which was is up and which way is down at the time the shot was taken.  That's dumb.  Really dumb.P.P.S.  Lowepro Ridge 30 cases fit either of the cameras described above perfectly.  DO NOT try to get a Ridge 20, based on the interior size specs and the exterior size specs for these cameras. First, you will have trouble finding a Ridge 20, because apparently, they don't make them anymore.  And as I learned, even if you get one, you will wish you hadn't, because they are so tight that it will be a chore getting either of these cameras in or out of the case.  Go with the Ridge 30, which is just slightly roomier, and thus perfect for either of these cameras.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera, once you take the time to learn it.", "Author": "Computer Depot", "ReviewID": "RCZOBNIOM7IW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am amateur photographer who loves taking pictures wherever I am.After my Samsung ST45 died on me last year, I was in search of a replacement.I stumbled across the F300EXR while googling for camera deals.After reading the reviews I was very skeptical, about the purchase. However I was able to find the camera as an open box item for $149 with free shipping and figured it was worth the risk since there was nothing in that price range that could beat the specs on paper.I wanted a camera that was very portable, Wide Angled, High Zoom and durable.Here is my take after having for just over 2 months:Build Quality and Design Layout:The camera feels sturdy and is well built. My main concern is the paint coating. I have a case for the cam, but often slip it in my pocket or rest it on surfaces when stabilizing a shot. I now have some areas where little bits of paint have been scratched away. I thought this occurred way to easy for such a well built camera.Image Quality and Performance:To be honest my expectations probably where a too high, just like some of the other reviewers who gave negative comments on this cam. The hype from the product site suggested I was going to take DSLR type pics with this cam. Which truth betold I think I have. But that is in certain conditions, which is why I still am satisfied with the performance of this cam. I have taken pics that I never thought possible with such a compact and low priced camera. The camera indoor performance is not that impressive. But once you have good lighting; macro, portraits and landscape shots are wonderful. The GUI and Camera options allow for loads of adjustments before taking a shot. Those who have complained about getting poor shots, should visit the following site kimletkeman.blogspot.com loads of tips and sample shot of the F300EXR and the new F550EXR. The dynamic range feature also allows some effects and contrast to standout that you might miss with comparable cams. Write speeds could have been a little faster.Conclusion:I am happy with my F300EXR and plan to take a lot more great photos with it. I might consider the F550EXR if I can spare the money end of year as the GPS and enhanced noise reduction are appealing.I didn't bother to go into details about the Zoom, 12MP, flash and ISO as I am not a pro. I would suggest anyone who is considering buying this camera to just google F300EXR on flickr and make your decision from there.Have a look at my pics an let me know what you think.flickr.com/photos/askjasonbowen/5742169237/in/photostream", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Next fuji of many", "Author": "stuart", "ReviewID": "R2RLD8RGH9I45A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can say that I'm a fuji fan, after owning a f40fd (sold), f100 (lost in a taxi) and a f200exr (still have, well my wife does anyway). They make good camera's.After trying the f300exr on a business trip, I have to say that I love ths little camera as well. The negative that people point out are valid to a certain extent, but this is a neat, tidy and very clever little camera - ideal for holiday work.Low light performance - not as good as my previous fuji's, but then it was never going to be, as the sensor is smaller, with a higher resolution, and a higer f number lense. It is however still OK, but not a great as it used to be.Flash - having the flash pop up every time, and it's location isn't ideal, as it gets in the way of my finger, but the neat little thing that nobody mentions, as that if you just push and hold it down, the camera automatically detects this and turns it off!

I've taken some 360 degree shots that are pretty cool. I am very impressed with the Fuji brand and would definitely buy from them in the future. I recommend this camera and would buy it for a gift as well.Notes: - If you put it in your pocket without a case (to get it out of the way or something) the main dial tends to rotate and change the mode you are in.- When you are in preview mode, the picture loads in two steps. It comes up fast in low quality, then sharpens up as all the data is loaded.- There is no way to delete a picture right after you take it. You have to switch to preview mode, find it, and then delete it. I called customer support and they confirmed this. I like the delete function on other brands, but this isn't a big deal.- The flash pops up on the top left-hand corner of the camera. This is where I typically put my finger. I have had to get used to putting it on the side instead.- There are a ton of options and modes on this camera. Enough to let you play for a long time.- Very sturdy camera.

The tiny SD780 massively outperformed this Finepix EXR in every low-light shot.  Fuji's low-light performance was primitive at best. The Fuji's flash did not once fire properly over several evenings of testing. Fuji's pictures were very grainy (compared to the Canon SD780.) I tested and compared every plausible setting on the Fuji, very systematically. Fuji's focusing was slow, fuzzy and unreliable.  The Fuji EXR technology did not produce the background detail portrayed in the Fuji hype -- i.e., background was way overexposed so that all detail was totally burned out in a variety of scenery situations.  (I really wanted this feature to work too.) Only the Fuji's 15X zoom was better than the 3X zoom on my SD780. I'm outdoors lots, active and wanted small camera w/ big zoom to take along, rather than my larger camera with more zoom than my 3X SD780. I very sadly returned this Fuji Finepix camera, very disappointed that even my wishful thinking could not overcome the pitiful performance I got from this camera.  So until another mfr. offers a similar form/feature set, I'll rely on my Canon SD780 despite its measly 3X zoom -- it's really pocket size, it works great indoors/low-light, as well as in a wide range of outdoors/nature situations, the flash fires properly and the focus is relatively fast and very reliable.

I took EXCELLENT low-light images, even at ISO 400-800.  It had a 1/1.6\" CCD sensor, the largest among point & shoot cameras.  Even my F40fd with a 1/.6\" sensor took excellent low-light photos.When the F200EXR was released, also with a 1/1.6\" sensor, and received good reviews on dpreview.com, it was on my list to buy.  But by the time I got around buying it, Photokina expo was just a few months away and I had a feeling that the F200EXR will be upgraded.  It did get upgraded with the F300EXR, but... the sensor was reduced in size to 1/2\", the same size as most mediocre performing P/S cameras in low-light.Cautiously overexcited, and not wanting to wait for (if ever) dpreview.com's review of F300EXR's low-light performance, I jumped on Fuji's EXR-SN mode bandwagon, thinking that the EXR-SN mode will be so good, that it will compensate for the smaller 1/2\" sensor.Boy, was I terribly wrong!  What a blunder I made.  Even though in dpreview's review of F200EXR they stated that the EXR-SN mode did not have much advantage over Lumix LX3's 1/1.62\" sensor, I still foolishly believed that EXR-SN mode's pixel-binning (joining two adjacent pixels as one large pixel) would have a huge advantage.  It does not.At ISO 400, the images are so over processed, that they appear blotchy, having a water color effect.  The same could almost be said for ISO 200.ISO 800 is simply unusable.  A cell phone camera might take better photos.In spite of not having read a review of F300EXR on dpreview, and realizing that it had a much smaller 1/2\" sensor (not good for low-light), the reason I bought this camera (and am returning it tomorrow morning), was because of its excellent specifications, and, these excellent sample photos taken by someone with the F300EXR (at ISO 200, Velvia mode, DR200):  [...]These above photos were proof enough for me that this must be an excellent camera.  Perhaps I got a lemon, but after extensive testing of my own at various modes and ISO 100 thru 800, in daylight and at night, with and without flash, I am convinced that even if I tested a replacement, I will get the same blotchy test results.  Even in daylight, when dynamic range is set to DR400, ISO 400 is used, and this in turn makes the photos blotchy.I had very high hopes for this camera, so much so, that I was recommending this camera to all my friends and relatives prior to my buying it, touting the EXR sensor, but also cautioning them that it had not been reviewed by dpreview, and that the sensor was too small.  I am soooo glad that they did not buy it (one almost did, but was not available at the store).The above sample photos, which convinced me to buy this camera, are still a mystery to me.I am returning mine in the morning, and will not be buying another P/S camera which has a sensor smaller than 1/1.6\" or 1/1.7\".", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good idea in a non-ergonomic body", "Author": "Teapot Tales", "ReviewID": "R2IPBS46MU89OJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this camera has great specs, but before you start using it, you have no idea how uncomfortable this little camera can be. First of all, it lacks any good grip curves and it is slippery (meanwhile, it is rather heavy for its size). Secondly, they designed this pop-up flash that is completely automatic and you cannot make it not to pop up every time you power camera up. And the spot where the flash pops up is where you really want to keep your left hand index finger.Even after you update this camera's firmware, the device still goes through batteries like crazy. One day of intermittent shooting could mean up to THREE battery changes.The video shooting mode has some atrocious auto-focus problems. The camera cannot keep up with any moving objects, so they keep being shot out of focus.Also, the wide-angle mode (no zoom) causes some pretty bad fish-eye like results, so if you have to shoot a portrait, you need to step back a little (if you can) and use a bit of zoom - like 2-3x.On the bright side, this camera has wonderful sensor mode settings, great low-light performance, it is rather fast and has tons of zoom power.

I started out by taking a few shots in the house with the camera set to Auto.  In all but the darkest areas I got fine results.  I have a E-PL1 with a f1.7 lens that will do better, but this camera has only a 1/2\" sensor and a f3.5 lens; I don't expect it to be perfect. Now I can carry this camera in my pocket and when I need a different focal length, other than the 40mm of my Olympus, I can pull this guy out and have a nice wide angle or telephoto shot, if one presents itself.I ran off about 100 shots around the house and then downloaded them and examined them on the computer.  I was very pleased with the results -- even when blown up to over 100% crop most of the shots were very acceptable.  8x10's will look great and 12x16's will even be possible.

After taking a picture, you'd have to wait weeks for them to develop and that's when you'd see how decent or awful your efforts were.  But I was taking a trip to Mexico City and I decided I had to do better than that.My sister had a two year old Sony cypershot she really loved, and I saw how easy it was for her to review and retake, load up pictures to her laptop and request prints online.  I knew digital was the way to go.  Instant notification of shot quality and only order prints of what you want.  I did weeks of online searching, learning aspects of digital cameras and professional and consumer reviews on how different ones held up.I settled on this one mainly for the features offered (especially the automatic modes and the incredible zoom) all in a very nice size.  As stated, I am not a photographer, so I wanted a few crutches to help me get amazing photos of my trip.  But I also like the option of being able to grow into something, and this has several features allowing manual settings.After two weeks of using this camera to photo the desserts and various ruins of Mexico as well as its beaches, I am proud to say this held up.  The zoom really is something else.  My father took his hefty digital SLR with telephoto lens and when we compared pictures, I couldn't see a difference, and I'd rather carry around this small camera than his huge one.I took the advice of several of the reviews I read and turned off the two facial modes.  I didn't think I needed them and I trusted it would improve battery life.  Whether or not it did, I can't be sure as I never tested the life with those modes activated, but I found the battery life lasted me all day and to spare.  I took indoor pictures with and without flash, outdoor with great lighting to low light, and night pictures.  I am very pleased with the results in all aspects.  In basically playing around with it, I discovered the best settings for different kinds of pictures.  Overall, I found the Auto mode seemed to have a richer color than the EXR pictures, so I would recommend just the Auto.Camera operation is very intuitive (I learn something new every time I use it), pictures are simple to upload, figuring out battery and memory cards insertion was a snap, the LCD screen is very visible in bright sunlight (even at full noon in Mexico), and the zoom is extremely quick and far reaching.  The only thing I have to complain about is already mentioned in other reviews:  the flash comes up any time the camera is on-even with flash mode turned off.  However it is very easy to get used to, and I did not find it to be a problem.As of writing this review, I haven't used the panorama 360 picture yet, or tried the fast shot mode, but if they are anything like the zoom or multi tracking, I'm sure I'll be very happy.I trusted Amazon enough to buy this \"like new\" from the warehouse, and I haven't had a single problem.

I'm not interested in composing a particularly artistic shot or spending time learning about the fine points of photography. I've been using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS15 12MP Digital Camera with 5x MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Black) and have been mostly satisfied with it, but I was eager to try out and review this Fujifilm FinePix camera when given the chance.I was disappointed that there was no printed user manual included, just a \"Basic Manual,\" which is a getting started type of guide. Instead, the enclosed CD contains a PDF file of the 144 page user manual. While I would have read, or at least skimmed, the entire printed manual, I am not fond of reading on my computer screen for very long. So I am on my own in figuring out the fine points of this camera, and will just use the PDF manual when I'm curious enough to look up a topic. This is annyoing enough for me to withhold a point in my rating.I've tried the camera out for a couple of days and am quite impressed with the quality of the pictures. They seem as sharp as those taken with my Lumix. So far I've found two features that raise the FinePix above the Lumix for me. It has a 15x optical zoom (compared to 5x on the Lumix), and it has a \"motion panorama 360\" setting that lets you take a 360 degree view of your surroundings by pressing the shutter and turning around quickly in a tight full circle. I've uploaded a customer image of such a shot which I took shortly after unpacking the camera and just playing around with the options. I was impressed with how easy it was to get this shot; so I am sure that as I explore more and read more there will be a lot more about this camera to wow me.Here are a few more observations:  Pro - the display monitor is bright and much easier to view in sunlight than that of the Lumix.  Con - the flash pops up exactly where I tend to place my left index finger while holding the camera, thus interfering with turning the camera on properly; I am concerned that this may damage the flash before I learn to keep my finger out of the way!

What I gave up in the purchase was the ability to stop by and ask bone-head questions, but that will force me to read the 150-some page owners manual that comes on a disc in PDF format.(The cheapest batteries for it - and photo cards as well, have been here on Amazon, but watch the shipping charges, as they added another $15 to the postage-size purchase)I have therefore used it as simply 'a point and shoot' but know that its capabilities far exceed that and ultimately I hope to master them.I write a travel blog and freelance travel articles, so it is the perfect size to take along and produces the photos I need for both blog and print. It fits in purse or jacket pocket, although it is a bit heavy as it has metal components - which also makes it a bit more sturdy.I've not had the battery life problems that some have written about, but again I am using it on low resolution, auto, so may not be zapping its strength as I might when I start using other settings.The large LCD is good for boomer eyesight but honestly I do miss the eye view finder.  Holding a camera at arms length, twisting and turning, just doesn't seem an effective way to use a camera (especially when they sell little flexible tripods to steady it. . .the forehead did a nice job of that on the earlier models).The flash, as noted by others, pops up automatically and I haven't yet figured out how to override it, that skill, I hope comes in time.

Prior to the trip I put the camera through its paces and was impressed with its EXR features. In addition the HD video and the panoramic modes are great! My wife took over 2000 shots while in Israel and they were all pretty amazing. If I didn't know better I would have sworn she had taken my DSLR with her.The camera is also heavier than you would expect. Not so much that you can't hold it up and shoot all day long.

I went to manual mode and limited the ISO to 200... still the noise was everywhere. Flash would light your face, but everything in the background was pixelated. EXR settings for low light bump up the ISO to 1600 making the picture full of noise. Outside the pictures were good, but in the end, I use my camera indoors a lot, so no good for me.

Dubose", "ReviewID": "R3DJ9V69CFISEO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "AAAAAHHHHH another point n shoot.  When I got chance to review the Fujifilm FinePix F300EXT point n shoot camera I jumped at the chance.  I currently have the Canon PowerShot G10, which I love but it's just too big for some occasions.  So I've been in the market for a smaller point n shoot camera.So I take this camera out of the box, first glance, I thought it's a handsome looking camera. Sleek and feels solid, which gives it a reassuring feeling when I held the camera.  So I switch on the camera and the blue light on the power key lights up. At the same time, the flash pops up from the body while the lens extends from the matte shell. The first thing I notice when you look at the top of the point-and-shoot is the mode dial, which is slanted toward the back of the camera. At first I thought it was weird but when I started using the camera, it's easier to access the ridged mode dial with our thumb compared with other point n shoots I've owned. There is a 3-inch LCD and a four-way clickable scroll wheel in the back of the camera.  The scroll wheel spins a little too loosey-gosey for so that forced me to slow down to get to the desired menu option. There is also a dedicated movie-recording button on the right side, though it can be hard to feel it with your thumb because it is flush with the camera's body.  After a little practice, you'll have not problem finding it without looking.Similar to other high-end FinePix models, the Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR offers five different film 'modes' to allow the photographer full creative expression to explore a variety of pre-set colour and contrast modes designed around Fujifilm's most famous film emulsions. The modes are: Velvia/Vivid (for dramatic full saturation colour), PROVIA/Standard (for classic 'neutral' photography), ASTIA/Soft (for gentle, low contrast portraiture and soft, fine, smooth tonality), Sepia (for antique, warms tones), and Black & White (for dramatic monotones). The FinePix F300EXR offers Program Mode, Aperture-Priority Mode, Shutter-Priority Mode and Manual modes to give the photographer creative control for those difficult or challenging subjects.The F300EXR gives a very impressive first impression and the actual images are pretty good.  All said and done though, the creative capability offered by a larger than average zoom in a smaller than average chassis cannot be underestimated. If you're prepared to put up with or work around its shortcomings, then the F300EXR is still well worth checking out.The bottom line: The F300EXR is recommended for those who want a compact camera with a long zoom lens and speedy focusing system. If your looking for a new digital camera to capture all of your precious memories then you probably won't go too far off the mark with the Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR. Extremely pocketable digital camera sports a high zoom range without taking up too much space, and yet is more than capable of delivering a slew of great looking shots under the ideal conditions.  Key word ideal conditions. For me it was a mixed bag, some pictures where good, others not so good. I used this camera in every possible condition bright, way too bright, dark, stills, action and everything in between.  With a little software editing most of the pictures came out great.  For me its pocket-friendly size, fits nicely in my hand for easy controlled shooting. The FinePix F300EXR is solid and finely crafted shooter, which is capable of standing up to minor knocks or abrasions. Apart from that, it also comes with a 3.0' high contrast (1:1200 ratio), wide-view LCD display that enables you to tilt the camera at different angles to see the picture. If I had to say a bad thing about this camera would be if your not shooting in ideal conditions, to really take excellent pictures you would have to manually adjust some of the camera settings. But with that said, you'll have to do that with any point-n-shoot.
