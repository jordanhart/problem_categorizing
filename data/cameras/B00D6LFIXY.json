{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought this to replace an old s5000.", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R1ZM5KHETE7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old s5000 battery door broke, so we needed a replacement. This s4800 is the nearest match.We wanted a camera similar in size and function as our old camera.Easy to use the new one we figured. We are not disappointed. The s4800 is easy to use for us. Panoramic view is fun and easy because the screen has a target that you line up, and the camera auto shoots for you. TOO COOL!We have also used the 3d, but we don't have the necessary viewing equipt., as far as I can tell.The video seems fine, although I am just getting started with that. usually,  from our experience,cameras don't video well, and video cameras done take pictures well.I like the size of the cam, I like the quick start up.It has 30 times zoom.My old was 22, and pics of the grand canyon etc, were awesome. I haven't been anywhere to use the 30, but I would imagine you will need it on a stand and on auto timer. All in all, for the money, we are happy.If it breaks or gets lost /stolen, not a lot of mula to replace. Our old cam lasted 12 years and 3 continents, and thousands of pics. I expect this one will last the same. One thing to mention....you cant use lens filters on this one, as far as I know. My thoughts are that the software may correct problems without a lense. I never really had much  luck with filters etc anyway.We are point and shooters for the most part.This camera does that wonderfully for us.PS> The first camera malfunctioned, and we had to send it back.This camera will malfunction if you turn it on before the lens cover is removed.It will get an error message about removing the lenscover.YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE CMAERA AFTER THAT ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS...Unfortunately, its very difficult to get the lens cover off before you turn on .You forget, , or when you unplug the camera usb from a computer, the camera will automatically turn itself on, and jam the lens.This happened to me.I  removed the batteries, turn it off and on etc...nothing worked. I was just about to send it back, when I inadvertantaly ''zoomed'' it. It resert itself, works fine.I hope it wasn't a fluke, and if it jams again, I hope the ''trick'' works.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D6LFIXY"}}
