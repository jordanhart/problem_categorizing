I had been looking for quite some time and a friend had the FD-71 and was very happy with it.  So easy to use a  4th grader could immediately use.  I was not looking for the features that  the FD83 had as I already had a digital video camera.  I really like the  idea of being able to click in a floppy and start shooting and not having  to hook up anything once I get home to start printing out my shots.  The  only disappointment to me is the low resolution.  If you want to print  anything larger than a 4 x 6, you loose the clarity.

I have read the reviews given here and I must say, I agree and disagree with some.  Personally, I love the floppy disk storage.  It's not  hard at all to throw a few extras in just in case you need them.  I love  the idea of not having to use any cables or \"special\" programs to  download my pics.  I will say though, I have gotten quite a few pics. that  were of poor quality (fuzzy) and then out of the blue...picture perfect.  I  use a photo program I bought from Walmart for $10, EZPhoto (I used it when  I scanned my \"old\" paper photos) and I normally reduce the size  of my picture A LOT to send quicker through emails.  This camera does have  an email feature though. Quite a few people said that you don't get a very  good quality pic. for printing, but I have to say I disagree.  Maybe the  printer they are using is of poor quality.  I have printed hundreds of  pics. and everyone has enjoyed them and are so surprised they came from a  print off from the digital camera.  One thing that disappointed me about  this camera is...for the $ you spend, you don't get a carrying case.  I  bought a cheap \"purse\" that looks like a camera case and has many  compartments to carry all the extras (battery charger etc.). I spent $6 on  it and it was well worth more than that.  You can't tell it's even a purse.  Another thing, I checked all over..stores and internet and the price of  this camera does not really vary...and if  there's a substantial difference in pricing somewhere..CHECK TO BE SURE  YOU'RE GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGER WITH IT!

It is very easy to handle, zoom is excellent, using ordinary discs is great, battery system fine.  But very often I have been disappointed with the quality of pictures.  There is  simply not enough pixels. Pictures from houses for instance are good  enough, from people so and so, mostly not.  Near shots from flowers look  little bit waxy and stiff but I have taken lots's of them.  Most  disappointments I have had with nature pictures, grass looks odd, too much  details for such a few pixels. If I would have known this I would have  choosen more pixels.

It is an excellent camera and I certainly would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a Digital Camera at a reasonable  price. However, a couple of points about the camera. First, the LCD view  finder gets dirty and scratched easily. There should be a cover for it when  not in use. Second, it is almost impossible to see the view finder when  outside in bright sunshine, making it hard to take a picture. Cannot see  what you are viewing. I think it would be nice if Sony had put a regular  view finder on the camera for taking outdoor pictures.", "Date": "January 23, 2000"}, {"Title": "Don't buy as your ONLY camera", "Author": "Rob Olivera", "ReviewID": "R189H8N1BET230", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you take only 1 thing from this review, let it be this: THIS CAMERA IS NOT FOR YOU IF YOU PLAN TO DO PHOTO-EDITING (MANIPULATION)  Most of the photos you take with this camera will look a little blurry on your computer screen, and God forbid you ZOOM-IN on the photo using your photo-viewing program.  The quality of the photos is horrible (mostly due to the .jpg compression) and gives the photo a 'pastel-color' look to it.  The camera does have a setting to take better quality pictures using .BMP capability but when you use this setting you will be able to fit ONLY 1 PHOTO PER FLOPPY DISK.  Although the quality is better when using .BMP it is still not good enough for a serious photographer.  The LCD screen will get fingerprints on it if you even THINK about putting your finger anywhere near it and if you're under strong sunlight it is hard to see the image.  A viewfinder would've come in handy, however.. I like the idea of not having to put the camera up to my face to take a pic.  A necessary evil you might say.  If you DON'T have money to burn, do yourself a favor and either wait until digital cameras are a dime-per-dozen or take out a mortgage loan to save up for the FD-90 Sony model.  I don't know about you, but ...+ is not something I part with easily least of all for a camera.  WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: Online Auctions (Ebay), Unimportant pics.  Also, credit must be given where credit is due: For me, the main selling point of the Sony FD series is disk storage capacity.  This is a definite plus that enables you to share photographs with other people when they dont have a photo-downloading facility in their PC (in my experience this includes one hell of alot of people).  The 10x zoom is also a God-send. You can almost use the camera as binoculars if you want to.  The camera also enables you to format a floppy disk (at the expense of alot of battery life).  A fully charged battery will give u approximately 2.5 hrs of camera use.  In closing;  Get this camera if you truly have your heart set on it, but be forewarned about the day that you are going to want to take the PERFECT PHOTO.  It's not going to happen with the FD73.  Not in the standard .jpg compression it delivers, and not at the 640x480 maximum capacity size.", "Date": "November 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "good but not great camera", "Author": "Bernie Bernbaum", "ReviewID": "RKJC95TLYTWJW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more. 2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.  3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.  On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.  P.S.

Be prepared to  miss several shots due to slow recording time, but the upside is, you do  not have to down load your pics, just change the disk and keep going.

If you want 1024x768 pictures, go ahead and spend the extra money. But this one does just great. The ability to pop in a fresh diskette  and keep shooting is addictive. Preview and delete shots easily. Remarkably  good battery life. The 10x zoom is amazing, will blow you away. I've used  it to document everything from the wiring and hoses on my sailboat to  furniture we might want to add to our home. Incredibly convenient, simple  to use. One thing to watch for: bright sunlight behind you can wash out the  LCD display so it's hard to see what you're shooting. So just find some  shade or reposition your shot.

Being that I'm a computer dolt, I sought out the easiest camera to use. The disc feature seemed easiest thus best suited and Consumers' report spoke highly of the camera. My photos are some of the best I've ever seen on eBay and it was a cinch to figure out and use. I have not used many of the bells and whistles, but habitually use the \"bright +/-\" feature: you click that feature a couple of times to compensate for the excesses of natural or man-made light or to get a photo that closer approximates the color of the item photographed. It works miracles and if, in order to closer approximate the color of the object, I end up with a dark photo, my computer software allows me to brighten the image again without distorting the color. Another beneficial characteristic is the clarity of the photos taken from close up. Holding the camera steady is essential. I often need extreme close ups if the object is a war medal or coin or token and get amazing photos by holding the object close to a light in the basement and photographing close up, such that I've got the coin in one hand held toward the basement ceiling and the camera in the other, with the camera between the light and the object so that light hits the object with no shadow. I'm beginning to use this technique for all my close ups of any object. Also, I'm using one of those spiral shaped long-lasting bulbs in the basement, but don't know whether that plays a role in my success with this technique or not. Another great thing about this \"close up\" technique is that I have total control over the light, and can see what image I'm going to get, unlike flash. It is obvious from surfing eBay that most sellers are not savvy to this technique. I sorely wish the camera had a hair trigger though. Especially when I'm doing the basement close up technique, where both hands are over my head and a steady hand is at a premium, yet physically taxing at my age (47), the click button is cumbersome, refusing to respond to gentle suggestion. This problem is distracting, but a small price to pay for the amazing photos that help maximize my sales.

BARROW", "ReviewID": "R1431CTI14ZOBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for some time, and I couldn't put it down when I first got my battery charged!The Mavica series is a blessing.  The FD-73 is, I recommend, to be used for general purpose shooting.  The absence of a manual focus and poor quality photographs under low-lighting conditions forces me to rate this with only 4 stars instead of 5.  Photos appear too grainy under low-light.The 10x zoom is great.  The included NPF-330 rechargable Lithium battery is a godsend, giving you up to 3 hours of continual use.  Good idea would be to purchase an additional NPF-550 which lasts much longer.  I always keep one in use, and the other on charge.  The batteries will last around two years before they need to be replaced.  These batteries can be used with many other Sony digital cameras and camcorders.My biggest gripe with the FD-73 is it's resolution: JPEG's are only 640x480 in size.  The compression is so-so.  However, the picture effects (sepia, B&W, solarize, negative) are pretty nifty, although I only used the B&W myself.  Similar effects can be achieved using any good graphics program.  The LCD can be very difficult to view while outside under sunny conditions.  Another gripe is the white-balance: you can't control it.  Taking pictures of family against open scenery is difficult, making photographs appear to be back-lit.The controls were easy to manipulate, and the floppy disc can hold anywhere from 1 (if using Bitmap mode) to 20 pictures (depending on image).  Of course, you can fit more images on a disc using B&W mode if you prefer to take black and white photographs.I eventually upgraded to the FD-91, which isn't available on Amazon.com anymore.

Blosser", "ReviewID": "R3KIXZVRZ1SFEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have three of these cameras here at work and they are great for the field but most of the users say that they are too limiting.  I found this  not entirely true.  After reading the manual that came with the camera, I  found that you can use one of five special effect settings.  While this is  nice, the main point is that you can also chose exposure settings.  I set  it for action photo and took pictures of my nephews playing basketball.  Not a blurry picture among them.  What was really great was that I gave  each one a copy of the pictures right on the spot by bringing some old  floppies with me.  The nephews made wallpaper out of them for their PC's  and they and their friends think it's great.  While my other friends may  have more expensive cameras, they can't share the pictures right on the  spot.  Great for reunions when you only see friends and families once in a  while.  Instead of promising to e-mail or snail mail pictures, just hand  them a copied disk. Oh, yeah, you can also take a picture of yourself with  the timer feature.  Special Note: As soon as I got the camera out of the  box, I taped a clear piece of plastic over the LCD view screen to protect  it.  I read a previous review which said how easily scratched it can get  and seeing our other cameras here at work, I was not taking any chances.  Guess what? Looks ugly but protects well.

The floppy disks are very convienent for inter-office exchanges, and  it is not difficult to carry around a few extra floppies when you're on the  move and want to take a lot of pictures. I had no trouble at all learning  how to use the camera and had taken a picture, imported it onto my  computer, and posted it on the internet in about 5 - 10 minutes. It is  pretty durable too - I dropped it off the back of a speeding golf cart and  it was fine afterwards (phew).  However, as time went on, I found the  picture quality average at best. The camera does not take reliable shots,  and the quality can vary from excellent to extremely poor. I know how to  use a camera and how to take what should be a good shot, but too often the  pictures end up fuzzy or over/under exposed. I can get better quality  taking non-digital pictures and scanning them in (although this takes  considerably longer). Also - the zoom feature is useful, but like many  zooms, does not quite provide a focused shot. My advice: if you're  just starting out and looking for a quick and very easy way to take digital  pictures, this camera is a good choice. If you have any experience with  digital cameras or even a regular 35mm, look to spend a little bit more,  and get a lot more quality for your money.

When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.", "Date": "January 4, 2001"}, {"Title": "Stepping Stone to Great New Photography", "Author": "Stephen Todd", "ReviewID": "R263D39XN0CQL5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the Mavica FD73 for 18 months of use.

I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use.

I use it mainly to take pics of the various items I sell on eBay, and I've found it to be fairly reliable, although the picture quality & resolution isn't always consistent. Some of my photos will be reasonably crisp & clear; others will be a bit muddy. Of course, this could just be due to a lack of photography skills on my part, since my parents also own one of these, and their photos consistently come out nice and clear. They use theirs to take reference pics and event photos for the various organizations they're involved in.The Mavica MVC-73 is okay for taking outdoor & social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably well-lit, and the proper picture-type settings are being used. Unfortunately, the flash function for darker occasions isn't all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject(s), and has a limited range of about eight feet (approx. 2.5 meters). Beyond that, you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.The camera also features a playback mode, where you can review the previous pics in the disc. It's a good thing to have in case you're not sure if the last snap you took came out well or not. In my case, usually not! Another nice feature is the auto shut-off, which kicks in after about two minutes of disuse. Although the battery is stated to last for up to 2.5 hours, I've never gotten more than an hour and 50 minutes from a ful charge. Never the less, a `full' cell will usually last me a week or so, since I don't use it too much. One somewhat inconvenient thing about the battery, though: you have to remove it to recharge it, instead of just plugging it directly into an AC adapter/charger. And even though the storage on 3.5 inch disks is convenient in one sense (I can download the pics from the disk into the hard drive faster), the limited capacity of the disk can be a problem. At most, I can get 18 images onto one floppy.Oh, and one last thing. I know this sounds a bit clich\u00e9, but do remember to remove the lens cap before trying to photograph something! I've had times when I'd turn my camera on, and the view screen would be completely dark, when it should've been showing whatever the lens was aimed at! Speaking of the lens cap, it's attached to the neckstrap by a small cord. Although it has a small clip on it to hook onto the neckstrap, it never stays on! This isn't so bad if you're clickin' pics at the normal angle & elevation, but when you're shooting snaps of things on the ground below you like I do, that dangling cover in the frame can be a real pain!`Late", "Date": "January 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "did not like", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "RUFX8SE0ZBNHD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The images always seemed out of focus.

It is extremely durable -- I have dropped it at least a half-dozen times from a standing height, and has been exposed to mist and humidity countless times -- and it still functions perfectly to this day.  The function of the floppy disk easily makes it the most convenient camera for email and quick uploading.  Though because of the size it is to accommodate the floppy disk, the camera is a little on the bulky size.  And the zoom is incredible!  The 10x optical zoom is still the function that has most impressed people who have seen the photos I have taken.  Yes, the camera has poor picture resolution compared to most cameras on the market, and it has been the one function that has frustrated me when I wish to take detailed photos, but the camera has served me well; a great rough and tumble digital camera.

I took 14 photographs, they had to be indoors as it was dark outside. Cats and dogs were  most unco-operative, but eventually I had enough pix to work on and transfered them into the computer, re-sized added captions and printed them out. I found the camera very easy to use. It was very quick and easy to transfer the photos from the floppy to my hard drive, and the results were pretty good, seeing as I had not even bothered to read the instruction manual. I did have problems with red-eye, which I could have corrected if I had not been in such a hurry. The photo resolution is not as good as on my Kodak camera, but for beginners and certainly for children, it was good enough. I liked the fact it was easy to use and had various diferent modes, the Fine Art one was good, I have a lovely \"Impressionist\" type photograph of my blue Burmese cat.

It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well.
