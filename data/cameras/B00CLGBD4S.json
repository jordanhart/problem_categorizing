He dropped his old camera in the river so I knew I needed something more waterproof.  I was very pleased to find this camera for him.  It is so compact but has so many features.  And when I bought the bundle it was all I needed.  It's a great value, easy to use and lightweight. I would recommend this camera to everybody.  It's great", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.00", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 7 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Red) +\n<2> Transcend 8GB Class 4 SD Card + <3> PD-T14 Flexible Camera Tripod +\n<4> PD-DCM Compact Camera Case + <5> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet +\n<6> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <7> Microfiber Cleaning Cloth", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Red) with 8GB Card + Case + Flex Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TcG7x%2BWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CLGBD4S"}}
