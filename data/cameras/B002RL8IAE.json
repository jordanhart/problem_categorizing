It is awsome.  I but the button in my grandparents room and put the intercom in the main part of the house.  If one of them needs something they can push the button once and I can see what they want.  It works great!  It is real simple to use.  My grandparents are in their 90s and it is the simplest thing that I could find that they could use.  I imagine it works great as a doorbell also.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "works once", "Author": "CharleyChicago", "ReviewID": "R3R3K033C17F11", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned these intercoms for months and I'm very dissatisfied.  They work once and then have to be reprogrammed.  The units have to be opened up to get to the programming button.  You get them set up, and within a week they stop recognizing each other and have to be reprogrammed.  The batteries are not dead, but the units no longer communicate.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't Work from the Start", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R36F7AZRMUQODZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Save your money and time, I bought this for a business and we couldn't get this product to work properly.  It worked intermittently, even after making sure the voice activation feature was turned off.  Even the \"doorbell\" feature didn't work properly.  I immediately returned this product, by far the WORST wireless intercom system we've ever purchased... and we've gone through several over the years.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002RL8IAE"}}
