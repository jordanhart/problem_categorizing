But being in a small store and running 10+ machines such as coolers, pizza ovens and warmers, there's a lot of noise/background sound. Even though the camera would be 4 feet away from the register, the sound is still very muffled. You can still listen and understand people, but if they whisper or mumble then it's just not going to happen. I've also noticed that it doesn't pick up high frequency sounds like a \"beep\" of a cash register no matter how loud it is.The image quality is still horrible, but being that this is Night Owl and a very cheap camera I shouldn't have been surprised. It does it's job so there's not much else to say.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "So so camera", "Author": "R.
