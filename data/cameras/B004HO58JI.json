I have a bigger Fuji camera that I have been very happy with, but wanted a \"pocket\" camera that I could have with me all the time. This is perfect. I can take it to the restaurant when I have dinner with friends, or to little league practice, and it doesn't take up too much space, or too much of my time worrying about it. It takes great photos, and I am completely satisfied, and will purchase Fuji products again.This is a great point & shoot, take it and go camera", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does what I need it to do", "Author": "Fzumrk", "ReviewID": "R28SX70412SEPQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my circa 2003 Fuji A310.  I got this to use for documenting project sites for my job.  I used it for one project so far and it did a decent job.  I've been taking pictures in 3 megapixel mode, as this is really all the resolution I need.  The photos look good for the most part.  Only a few blurry shots out of about 100 total.Pros:I prefer the AA batteries over a rechargeable battery.  I'm often out in the middle of nowhere taking photos for work.  So, if I run out of batteries, I can always stop in any convenience store and get more AAs.The battery life is excellent compared to my old A310.  The A310 would shut down when the batteries were only half used up.  I put the 'spent' batteries from the A310 in the AX300 and got over 100 flash photos out of them.I like the automatic switching from automatic mode to macro mode.  I do a lot of alternating between wide shots and macro shots, and the automatic switching is easier than switching manually.Cons:I may just need to shut one of the settings off, but on a few shots the face recognition software kicked in when there were no faces in the shot.  This messed the photo up.The camera has locked up on me once.  Opening and closing the battery compartment re-set it, but this will be annoying if it happens frequently.  The range finder also seemed to stop working once, but worked again after re-setting.Update:  I haven't had any issues with the camera locking up since the initial use.  I have also bought a second camera of the same model (one for home, one for work) and have had no issues with it.Doesn't include any memory, so make sure you purchase a SD card for it.  They used to at least give you a minimum sized memory card when you bought a new camera, but not anymore I guess.It doesn't have a viewfinder, which is handy on days with very bright sunlight.When you connect this to a computer via the USB cable it doesn't show up as a disk drive.  You have to use the camera wizard to get the photos off of it.  This may be a software issue and I'll see if I can find a work around.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice pictures for such a small camera", "Author": "Stormy1", "ReviewID": "R2MSUIDT4X12OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought a Fuji AX300 digital camera here. The camera has a 5X optical zoom which is decent for a small camera. This is my 2nd one of these small Fuji cameras and overall, it's a pretty decent digital camera when it comes to a basic point & shoot type.It's easy to use once you figure it out, has a decent 5X optical zoom, macro zoom that works pretty good and fairly good picture quality. Videos on this camera is not as good as the voices gets \"choppy\" and garbled, even at lower volume levels. So, I would not use this for a video uses, unless you're outside at a sporting event where sound is not too critical, then it's fine for that. Video quality is good however.Picture quality is fine in sunny weather, tho the pictures can get all sun-washed and in darker low-light weather, the pictures are poor quality. If you take indoor pics with the flash, the pictures will turn out okay. Outdoor pics under partly cloudy conditions produces good photos with this camera. There are some manual settings on this camera also.Not too much I hate about this camera, except for the garbled voices I periodically get on the video mode, but that's no biggie for me. It uses 2 AA batteries and battery life with this camera is not as good as other cameras I have had, but luckily it uses easy to find AA batteries.So to sum it up in a few words....yes, I would recommend the Fuji Finepix AX-300 digital camera for general photography, scenic photography and family indoor or outdoor photos.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent price for a decent point-and-shoot", "Author": "sky58", "ReviewID": "R237AKOFS0WPOK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decently priced point-and-shoot camera that takes good pictures with decent lighting (where you can get above 1/60th shutter speed on auto).  The 14MP is a bit of an overkill for most users, but it is certainly nice to have that resolution.  As others have stated, it does feel a bit \"cheap\" because of the plastic casing, but functionality-wise, it works well.  The only con about the about the camera so far is it doesn't perform too well in low lighting situations compared to other cameras for both photos and video.  Images come out a bit more muddy than other cameras in low light which is a bit noticeable when you compare it side by side with a picture from another camera.  The image stabilizer doesn't really add much to those photos either so don't expect anything amazing with that functionality. The 720p video is decent and good for use if you want to take a last minute video of something.  If you're going to be recording video for an extended amount of time, be sure to grab a larger SD card as with a 4 GB card you can get around 10 minutes of video.  The interface is about 95% digital menus so expect to refer to the manual for specific functions, but it's not difficult to navigate for simple shoot modes.Overall, I found this camera OK.  It won't knock your socks off or anything (that's why I only gave it 4 stars), but it certainly works well and will get the job done.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Lady zenomi \"zenomi\"", "ReviewID": "R2WAQM8QA31H3Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "at first i was worried at how light camera felt out of the box almost like toy as another reviewer mentioned. However the pictures that this camera takes is great, straight forward, I am particularly happy with the fact that it has an option to take black and white pictures which I personally like for those vintage type shots i like to take.

I purchased the fuji camera because it was inexpensive but I was really surprised by the number of features, storage capacity. It works great.  In fact, I like it better than my expensive camera that I forgot up North since it is compact and takes better pictures.  The only downside I have with the camera system is trying to back up my download of pictures from the camera to my computer using the Finepix Studio program.

Aboud \"Troparion\"", "ReviewID": "R17JKYV8NWKSIO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I wanted to get a light camera for travel and convenience, and I thought I'd try this little one. It was tempting because of its features (photo and video in one) and it conveniently uses AA batteries. Right out of the box, the camera felt very light and cheap, a plastic toy. Its pictures were mediocre under normal lighting situations, but under low-light conditions they were terrible, and when I used the flash, the images came out fuzzy and way too bright. The video was not that great either; the worst thing about it was the clicking sound that came out during playback whenever the lighting level changed. I tested the video by slowly moving 180 degrees from bright daylight (through a window) to less and less light, until I was pointing into the dim room; on playback the video contained a loud click at almost every 30 degrees of movement. I've had two Fuji cameras in the past, the S1000fd is still my favorite. My experience with this one was a real disappointment. I returned it the next day.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not durable", "Author": "Songhai", "ReviewID": "R1NYNI0K1CDBW4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like many other folks who gave it 1 star, mine stopped working after several months.The lens would not retract. What makes it annoying is that I was one of those who bought it through HSN for $400.00 when it was released. There was so much hype about the camera because then it was the first point and shoot camera that had more than 10 megapixels. The closest camera to it has just 10 MP.The camera has very nice features and took beautiful pictures but durability is the problem.Since this is a common problem with the camera I wished Fuji had recalled all the faulty cameras and replaced it for the original owners. Prior to then I had another Fuji camera which impressed me so I went ahead to buy this one. I gave that older camera to my wife who used if for a few years before it started falling apart.No more Fuji camera for us!", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lens won't come out", "Author": "Deimos \".\"", "ReviewID": "R6T9OB5437EOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice pics but mechanically garbage.

Got it \"used-like new\" from Amazon warehouse. Yup, no physical defects except that i noticed a stuck pixel in the upper right area of screen which I am thinking that's why someone returned it. It doesn't get in the way at all and disappears in certain shots. You have to look for it to see it. this camera rocks when it comes to taking pics in dark rooms. When I am getting ready to take a picture in low light, I point, give the camera about 1 second to focus, brighten image and do some other stuff and take the picture. pics come out flawlessly. Some one else stated that you should disable the auto features cause it delays and makes the pictures look bad, but for us who are not camera buffs, I recommend you you leave them on cause the camera is pretty smart and takes excellent pictures for me. When recording 720 HD video, it looks very good. When you zoom while recording in HD, the audio doesn't get clipped and you CAN'T hear the zoom mechanism in the video like other cameras. The only gripe I have with this camera is that when you  want to switch from video to photo mode or vise versa, you need to do it via the menu. That's beat for me but the photo and video quality makes up for it. The camera feels hollow and toy like cause this thing is very light which I think is a plus. I have not dropped it yet and hope it doesn't break. I have a fuji camera that has been dropped several times, even on the middle of the road while running, and it is still working after acting a bit glitchy for several minutes but operates at full capacity now. I like that this thing takes 2 AA batteries and don't have to worry about recharging it like other slim cams. You have an unlimited amount of ammo ;) I gave it 5 stars regardless of the photo to video navigation cause this thing gives you extra bang for your buck. BTW, remember to pick up a Class 10 SDHC card so that you don't have to worry about performance.
