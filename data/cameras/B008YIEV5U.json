I took many great pictures of them (some not so great) until one child played a little too much with it.  I never replaced it and only used a point and shoot until I bought the T4i.  Now I don't have to worry about those not so great pictures as I can just delete them.  I'm having a great time remembering things from 20 years ago and learning new features now.  Definitely worth the money.  Love the touch screen.  If you can't afford this camera, just save your money until you can.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,149.98", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 2 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n1> Canon EOS Rebel T4i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens +\n<2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T4i Bundle 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging Canon PLUS: EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hnO%2B-bo0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008YIEV5U"}}
