{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Battery Life ???", "Author": "D. SENGUPTA", "ReviewID": "R2NR3ULYIG5GDI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Optio P70 is a great camera with lots of features which are very easy to use.It compares very well with similar products in the same price range. optio P70 is on the hogher side as far as the cost is concerned -- then it has 4x zoom compared to most others  with 3x zoom.However, I find that the battery life  is rather poor. If you are on travel or sight seeing you will run out of battery before the day is out. It will be essential for you to carry at least one ( if not 2) additional battery with you if you want to go thru photo session for the whole day.you can order very cheap alternatives( Battery) from Internet and dont have to purchase OEM battery at very high cost.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "MikeL.", "ReviewID": "R3BD7YIEJ9RU46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it right before a trip to Europe, had barely enough time to figure out some basic features out of a zillion this camera came with.  It worked great, took excellent pictures.  Wide angle and zoom shots are very comparable with those by my old SLR with a 29-90mm lense.  Also somewhere during the trip I found that it takes 640x320 video at 30fps, which on few occasions happened to be a nice supplement for my camcorder when it's battery ran out of juice mid-day.  With a big enough SD card (4-8GB) it may be used as a single photo+video camera by those who are not very picky about video quality.  The only negative with that would be significant loss of quality when zooming in a video mode.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost Picture Perfect", "Author": "prisrob \"pris,\"", "ReviewID": "R8N9KRWZIP2FY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. It has more features than I'll ever use but they are there if you need them.  Pentax seems to have covered all the bases with this silver camera. The lag time from shutter release to actually seeing the picture is a little longer than I'm used too but the end result is great. This little camera is easy to use and fits in my hands nicely.I've been very pleased with all this little camera has to offer. I carry it with me everywhere I go because I was tired of missing photo opportunities.  I have a new grandchild, and when she smiles I am there! I think it is a wonderful little camera, at a good price. It rates right up there with the big two (Nikon, Canon) and the Pentax has better construction.Pros:12.0 megapixels12.0 megapixel CCD captures large, detailed images, which can be printed as 11 x 14 inch enlargements (and larger) in clear resolution.4X wide-angle optical zoomThe 4X internal optical zoom is equivalent to a wide-angle 27.5-110mm, making it ideal for landscape, indoor, portrait or group photos, as well as farther away subjects.2.7 inch LCD screenThe large, bright 2.7 inch LCD screen is viewable at wide-angles, even in bright sunlight. It also provides for easy picture review with intuitive, easy-to-read menus.Ultra-slim bodyThe P70's ultra-slim, highly fashionable aluminum body.Pixel Track Shake ReductionPixel Track Shake Reduction mode reduces camera shake and blurring of the subject when photographing still images, as well as ensuring sharp images even in challenging lighting conditions. Pixel Track SR even produces these sharp images without adding any high ISO noise.Advanced Face RecognitionWith Advanced Face Recognition technology, the camera automatically recognizes and quickly captures up to 32 faces in 0.03 seconds, so every face is bright and focused, even in back lit areas.Smile Capture and Blink DetectionSmile Capture recognizes the precise moment a subject smiles and releases the shutter automatically, and Blink Detection gives an alert to retake the pictures if anyone's eyes are closed.PENTAX Auto Picture modePENTAX Auto Picture mode automatically selects from 8 shooting modes for the best picture in any situation.Vertical Snap modeVertical Snap mode provides the ease of cell phone-camera picture taking with the quality of the latest PENTAX Options by using the OK button to snap shots and the 4-way controller to adjust zoom.HD movie captureHD movie capture vividly captures moving memories in wide-screen 720p at 15 FPS.Cons:The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. It comes with a battery charger. I found obtaining a memory card helped to lengthen the life of the battery. I had read that the battery life was a problem for some, but it does not really interrupt photo taking for me. I have ordered another battery so that I may exchange when the need is there.I am very pleased with this camera overall.  All of its features make picture taking so easy.This is a great buy for its price. And, the camera size is just right. I can pop it into my purse and take it with me whenever I go out. Always camera ready.Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-05-09Pentax K20D 14.6MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and DA 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL II Lens", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't Find A Better Small Camera", "Author": "Jon W.

I only owned it for 1-2 weeks before I dropped it and the on/off button broke. It still turns on and works but unfortunately the shutter cover does not open all of the way so I have a little \"frame\" with each picture.It was my fault I dropped it because I am very clumsy. HOWEVER, this camera takes the most amazing pictures that I've ever taken.  I have a whole album on photo bucket that I wanted to link but could not figure out how. The shots are vibrant and terrific! I could NOT even believe that little old me took some of these shots. I have owned the Samsung NV3 - durable, sony cybershot w330 - okay but not vibrant shots, and the canon t3i. I have not taken my Canon to Cancun yet but my other three have visited with me. The winner so far is the Pentax. I can't stress enough how beautiful these pictures were. I'm currently searching to see if there is another camera similar to it, but if not I will most likely buy this one again. I paid 99 dollars at Bj's on clearance for my optio p70 in 2010.You can access my shots of this by looking up queenhammiejenkins on photo bucket. The album is the 2010 albumJust be careful not to drop it. I would even suggest adding little nonslip grips onto the camera to prevent others from dropping it when you ask them to take a photo. The body is very sleek.also, I have noticed that another person dropped their camera and the top bulged just like mine did.Aside from the dropping, it is a PERFECT camera!  I loved being able to choose my own ISO or just letting the camera do it for me!", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, excellent camera!", "Author": "Henri Savin", "ReviewID": "R3KMRBEFY7DY73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for a long time and I have just replaced it with a more expensive model.This camera is sturdy, light, small and very effective at taking pictures and shooting movies.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid build, tasteless photos", "Author": "Edward Barett \"Music predator\"", "ReviewID": "R9MWVH6B1MYB1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This device seems well built and give a good impression of quality and sturdiness, but photos are average in the best of cases.
