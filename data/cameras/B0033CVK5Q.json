{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I am very happy with my GE A1251 digital camera shown on Amazon", "Author": "Anne Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R2L7SOU9XDMLEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My GE A1251 digital camera was dropped and broken so I ordered another one and was sent  a GE 1255  that had a battery pack.  I sent that one back since I wanted a camera that I could use batteries.  Meanwhile, I looked on Amazon and saw a supposedly used GE A1251 in good condition for only $15 with about $10 for shipping.  So, I ordered and received the camera in a couple of days.  It looked like new and works great just like my former camera that I liked so much.  However, my first camera order did come after a week and I was sent a silver GE A 1250 that cost much more but will be adequate for a second backup camera.  I appreciate so much the fast and efficient service from Amazon and plan to check before ordering any other items.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The GE A1251 digital camera is easy to use, yet rich with features.\nIts offers a great combination of 12.2-megapixel resolution, 5X optical zoom and 2.5-inch ultra-clear LCD screen.\nFeaturing Face and Smile/Blink Detection, the GE A950 takes your picture taking experience to a whole new level.\n12.2MP imager delivers the quality you need for great photos on-screen as well as detailed prints\nIn-Camera Red-Eye Removal removes red-eye immediately while viewing images on the LCD screen", "Name": "GE A1251 12.2 Megapixel Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom 2.5\" LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31plXTWynkL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0033CVK5Q"}}
