It is exactly what I hoped it would be.  Works great.  Nice sharp picture from about 20 feet or so.  Very user friendly.  Not too heavy either.  Showed it to my son-in-law and he wants one now.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like this camera", "Author": "rudbecki", "ReviewID": "R3L7R3E9ING2HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera has nice balance when held. it is easy to use. It has a very powerful zoom (24x) for  this size camera. I am still learning how to use its features. I still like a small point and shoot for skiing and hiking when a small compact camera is valued but this camera is a nice size for carrying around in a camera bag. I like the shape of the body because it is comfortable when holding it to shoot a picture. I haven't used it enough to decide how i like the shutter speed or the different settings.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16.1MP High Sensitivity MOS Sensor\nLeica DC Vario-Elmarit 24x Zoom Lens\n25-600mm Optical Zoom Lens (Equivalent)\n3.0\" 460,000-dot Intelligent LCD Display\nFull Manual Override", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix FZ60 Digital Camera w/ Point & Shoot Advanced Package", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MAEeOnVpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0096DILA8"}}
