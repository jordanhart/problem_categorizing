GREAT color that I hardly never experienced with those Canon and Nikon point & shoot cameras. Hard to describe but it's something I should call...\"Kodak color\" (sorry I can't do better^_^;;) Very nice built quality, minimalistic design with touch screen, Kodak color, and Schneider lens...That's quiet enough for me. Be different and get that NICE Kodak pictures! P.S. Believe or not...I majored in Photography...could probably call myself a professional photographer! of course this is just one of my pocket toy(?!) camera LOL", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Jeremiah Nazarkewycz", "ReviewID": "R184QAHJYDVQAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product over a year and a half ago and have yet to have any issues with it.

NEVER was able to take a picture. Called Kodak more times than I'd like to talk about, and received the merry run around. Very rude and discourteous...offered us no satisfaction.

Donovan", "ReviewID": "R1BRXCZFF92XVK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is impossible to compose/preview a picture or see menu options / icons on the LCD display in any kind of sunlight, even with LCD brighness set to \"high\" and the LCD dimmer turned off.  If you want to take pictures anywhere other than inside, in the shade or on an overcast day, you will be very disappointed with the Kodak V1273.  The camera has many jazzy features, but they're essentially useless for sunlight picture taking.***Update #1 - February, 2009***Our V1273 has been inoperable for two months.  We sent it to the repair center in January for warranty repairs.  Upon return, we discovered that the battery would not hold its charge.  So, the camera's at the repair center again.***Update #2 - March, 2009***Precision Camera (the repair center) returned the camera with a new battery and no repair.  Needless to say, the camera and battery were dead on arrival.  Neither Kodak's call center nor their repair facility will acknowledge that there's a short in the camera that quickly drains the battery, even when the camera is not used.  So, we're recharging the battery and taking time lapse voltage readings to do the kind of troubleshooting that rightfully should be performed by the repair center.  The test clearly indicates that the battery holds its full charge for several days when not in the camera.  Put it in the camera, and the battery is dead within 5 hours with the camera turned off! It's anyone's guess what Kodak or Precision Camera will do with the results.  We're fast approaching 3 months without an operable camera.***Update #3 - April, 2009***Just received the camera from the repair center with an indication that they found nothing wrong!  After I received the camera and reinstalled the battery, it was no surprise that it was dead after about 5 hours of non-use.  To add insult to injury, Precision sent me a bulletin explaining the difference between a rechargeable and non-rechargeable battery with the recommendation that I make sure I'm using a lithium battery.  That's what I've been using all along.  That's the new spare battery they sent me in February and the exact same battery I returned to them in March.  It makes you wonder if they really take the time to test this stuff.Enough is enough.  They have finally worn me down.  I'm at my wits end with a camera that doesn't work and insufficient patience to go one more round with the Kodak call center or Precision Repair.***Epilogue***Credit where credit is due -- the folks at Kodak stepped forward to make things right with our V1273.  It's refreshing when companies stand behind their product and go above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst digital camera I've ever owned!", "Author": "AV8Tor", "ReviewID": "R266XIC8QKNL5M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is a pathetic POS.  I've owned about 8 different digital cameras since about 2001, and this one, by far, is the worst of them all.  It is cheaply made out of plastic, and not supported very well by Kodak.  Do yourself a favor, and give the money you would have spent to buy this camera and give it to a homeless person.  It would be much more satisfying to see your money put to good use.  Among the many, many problems this camera suffers from:1) A VERY weak LCD display that is IMPOSSIBLE to see outdoors in daylight.  The only way you can see the screen is to cup your hands over it or look at it in shadows away from direct sunlight.  Well, that makes it very practical to use, huhh?2) Poor digital still picture taking with noted fuzziness on parts of the picture.3) Extremely poor video capability.  Kodak touts themselves as having one of the first digital still cameras with the ability to take supposed \"HD\" video.  Well, it shows.  Even though it is technically HD at 720p, it looks more like standard definition since it is so fuzzy and indistinct. To be honest, I've seen SD video on other older digital still cameras take better video than this camera.  Also, if you want to take video with this, you had better use a tripod.  Even the slightest, and I mean slightest panning movement will produce very jerky, stuttering video which will be greatly amplified on a huge widescreen 52\" HD t.v.  The first time I saw video from this camera on my HD t.v., I thought I was going to get seasick from all of the movement!3) A touchscreen display that doesn't work very well.  I've had this camera for about 9 months now and my touchscreen doesn't even work that well.  When you push a menu item on the screen, sometimes it activates other menu items by mistake.  Good luck on not accidentally erasing all of your pictures!  I've already made that mistake more than once. Sometimes the touchscreen doesn't even work at all, no matter how hard or light you press the screen.4) A very weak battery that doesn't hold a charge that long.  The camera REALLY saps the strength out of the battery very quickly.  I could probably go through about 5 battery rechargings before I ran out of memory to fill up the memory card.5) The battery cover is cheaply made out of plastic and comes off very easily.  It is really easy to accidentally lose the battery while shooting because the battery cover always comes off with use.6) The firmware DESPERATELY needs an update.  How come all of the other manufacturers put periodic firmware updates on their websites to keep their products up to date and squash any potential issues?  Kodak has never done so for this camera, and that speaks volumes about what they think about their customer base.7) Half the time when I turn my camera on (regardless of temperature), my camera will freeze, lock-up and not work.  When I plan on using my Kodak V1273, I will often take it out at least 5 minutes prior to using it.  Sometimes it takes that long to get the camera out of the \"lock-up\" mode it seems to get into when you first turn it on.  This camera was NOT designed to use spontaneously.  When it locks up, the camera screen will blank out and it says, \"Processing...\".  Well, I'm so fed up with this piece of garbage that I'm about to \"process\" it right out into my trash can.8) When shooting through any kind of glass, (as through a car windshield, airplane or boat window), the auto focus sensor will ALWAYS focus on the glass instead of what's in the background.  That means I have a LOT of in-focus pictures of bugspots on my dirty windshield.9) Half the time, my lens will not retract after use.  As a result, I now have a dirty lens, which I thank Kodak for due to their lack of firmware updates (see #6 above).10) The buttons are not ergonomically designed.  Half the time when I want to press the shutter and take a picture, I accidentally turn the camera off by mistake.11) Whenever you go into the menu, and \"customize\" your settings for the camera, they only last as long as the power is on.  It's unbelieveable that Kodak would design a camera that you have to reset every single time you turn the camera back on.12) The camera flash always defaults to on whenever you first turn the camera on.  This annoying quirk has bitten me so many times that it's not even funny.  Imagine trying to take a picture, thinking you had manually turned the flash off and you surprise people by using that annoying thing.  Many times, in museums, concerts, and other places where a flash is not appropriate, I have managed to upset people because of this defective camera.Overall, the Kodak V1273 is the worst electronic device I've ever bought in 30 years of buying electronics.  Kodak should be ashamed of themselves by releasing this extremely subpar camera. If I could rate this product with less than one star I would, but Amazon doesn't allow that!", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this camera!", "Author": "J. R. Lauderback", "ReviewID": "R3OUHAIRTKL1AH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The touchscreen features on this product were quite impressive, but the camera doesn't WORK.  It frequently freezes up and presents a blank screen rather than taking the photograph.  I've been trying to get Kodak to honor their warranty for NINE MONTHS; I've sent it in twice, only to get it back with the same problem once and then get a refurbished camera that presents the SAME problem as well.  Tech support and customer service are in the Phillipines; they refuse to elevate the warranty claim, telling me to send it in again and again.  I've spent so much time on this it's like a part time job, and I STILL don't have a camera that operates properly.  You're taking a huge chance on getting ripped off with no recourse if you buy from Kodak.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Broken again", "Author": "Eli Barb", "ReviewID": "R16HZSG91JG25H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this listed under the v1073 because when I first wrote the review in May 2008 they didn't have an entry for the V1273. I'm updating the review with additional info and moving this to the V1273.My zoom button broke in under a month of very minimal use. I think I only took 200 pictures. The camera repair service that they use is horrible and since I needed the camera right away for a trip I had to overnight it to the repair center....four weeks later still no camera back. So I called the repair service and they said they had to send it back to kodak since it couldn't be repaired. Trying to call in to either the Precision Camera(the repair place) or to call Kodak for an update was like pulling teeth. I was very nice to the tech guy at kodak and he literally almost wouldn't let me speak to a supervisor about anything. Very poor customer service all the way around. The camera is going to end up costing me 75 dollars extra because of the whole ordeal and I may have to end up buying a new camera and returning this one when it finally does arrive.Functionally I like it ok. The software has frozen up a few times and I've had to power it off and back on to get it to work. It is also very hard to see the LCD when outdoors. The battery bay latch also very easily comes unhooked and it's so fragile I'm afraid it will break off when it does.--update---Zoom button broken again 8 months later after they sent out a complete replacement camera to me on June 1, 2008. I did receive customer service finally after guessing the email addresses for everyone listed on their site as an executive. I CC'd the whole lot of them with an explanation of my situation and complaint with their customer service. I must have hit a nerve with one of them because shortly after I sent that email they had someone high up in customer support contact me personally and send out a replacement with next day shipping and a free memory card to follow. The original rub was that I bought the camera 2 months before leaving to travel Europe for 3 months and in less than 30 days after purchase the camera was broken. So I overnighted the camera to the repair shop because their expected turn around was 3-5 weeks and I wanted to make sure they had plenty of time to fix it and send it back. Contacting them during the repair process they couldn't give me any information about where in the repair process or for that matter even where my camera was at.So there you go, unless you contact directly all their execs don't expect any sort of customer service and more importantly don't expect their cameras to be of any lasting quality.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Transaction", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "RXUIXWQIEMOHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Extremely happy with the purchase.

I had owned this camera for a while.  It filled my needs.  However, what Kodak failed to tell me is that these cameras are more or less disposable cameras! I mean I woke up one day and the thing did not work right anymore to the point now it finally quit for good. I started with, a black screen, then I would NEVER stay on! then the shutter would not open OR come out. I chase storms , I had a wonderful view of a funnel almost on the ground and the damn thing would NOT stay on! Thus I missed the best part of the cloud when the camera finally did turn on and stay on! HAHA and wouldn't you know it..Kodak would not honor the warranty either, all I got was a \"too bad so sad\" attitude! Plus I came to find the V-1273 camera was no longer available...they quit making them! What I gather now is that since the *digital* age came about , instead of ONE camera to last a life time...like I USED to have...I must buy a new camera every couple years. I mean why make the camera of quality that LASTS? That would mean Kodak sales figures would suffer!The ONLY reason I gave it three stars was because I used it a little bit and when it DID work it was awesome.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Camera", "Author": "maine \"maine\"", "ReviewID": "R24NN85OEC3MDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took pictures with this camera in Bar Harbor (some from a tour bus window) that are unbelievable.
