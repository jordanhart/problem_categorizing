{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simple Settings, Good Photos! Recommended!", "Author": "H. Mera", "ReviewID": "R1NLB15OXXTI90", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I forgot my high end camera while out of town . Bought  this since it was relatively cheap and easy to use. Got better than expected results. The  pics where clear. Only needed to adjust contrast on my PC which is typical for photos taken with digital cameras. The menus are straight forward.  The camera comes with a strap and two alkaline batteries. Took about 98 photos before the battery died. Recommend long life lithium batteries as replacements. The hand grip is  small., so keep the  strap on the wrist incase the camera slips. Small grip allows an easy fit into purse or pocket. I bought a 1 gig SD memory card to replace the small card that came with the camera. The battery will die before you fill up this card.  The camera is slow to take the photo and store it to memory, so patience is needed or the photos will come out blurry from moving the camera while it is still processing the photo. Again, this is typical of low priced digital cameras. I highly recommend this for first time users who don't want to spend a lot. Expect to exercise patience as the camera saves the photo to memory.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good for the short term", "Author": "MaxBetta", "ReviewID": "R1SDOIZFJ3LR86", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a little over two years ago and it has recently started going nuts to the point where I have to replace it.  It doesn't always warn you when the battery is getting low, and sometimes the only way to shut it off is to remove the batteries.  I gave it 3 stars because it worked great at first, but over the past month or so it has been a big disappointment.  Also, you should know that there are cameras out there that have 12mp for the same price. (Compared to the L11's 6mp)  It is really difficult to take good pictures without the flash as the shutter speed slows down and you end up with lots of blurs.  Also, the quality of the video is not great.  Although Nikon is a fantastic brand, this camera is really made for the \"point and shoot\" type people who just want to take snapshots.  If  you are at all interested in taking quality pictures or photography in general, you would be better off going with one of their other models.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Jill Blakeman \"tdg animal\"", "ReviewID": "RM048EH9T3WK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a little over a month ago and so far I've found no problems.
