They are \"cheap\", but the image/night vision is comparable to any other analog camera. The clarity isn't as high as a digital camera, but in this price range they work great.Can see about 30' of night vision range at night, colors are crisp, but having owned installed dozens of cameras/surveillance systems, these are the best deal out there. Buy a bunch.Also they are not a \"wide angle\" ---they are a little more zoomed. I would recommend getting ones with a 3.6 MM \"wide angle\" for the corner of rooms if you want to capture the whole room. These are good for hallways or long narrow spaces.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Price and good product", "Author": "Reba Byrd", "ReviewID": "R1542VBNH22NDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love these did not want to spend a lot of money and still wanted a great product.

Its almost like they are zoomed in. I've own 4 past security cameras systems before and these cameras are by far the worst. They might work well if you can mount them way up high and far away. You might not even notice how bad it is until you have owned other cameras. I have minemounted on the far corner of my house and all I see is the porch and steps. Oh and one other thing during the transitions stages between the Infrared turning on and off the cameras start freaking out. It looks like a old VHS player that is not in focus. It starts getting the lines across the screen. I'm not sure if they all are like this or if it is just mine. I might need to call them and ask but I don't care I plan on replacing with better cameras from ebay.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "COLORBLIND", "Author": "KHRAYZIE", "ReviewID": "R2AM92Z62K23QO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "FIRST OF ALL CAMERAS SHOULD START OUT WITH AT LEAST 100' OF CABLE. THIS PRODUCT ONLY HAS 60' PER CAMERA.  ONCE NIGHT TIME HITS AT LEAST TWO CAMERAS ARE VERY FUZZY LIKE THERE IS INTERFERENCE.  ONE CAMERA IS VERY CLEAR AND AT NIGHT IS VERY GOOD EVEN THOUGH IT IS COLOR BLIND IN THE DAY. ALL THE CAMERAS HAVE THEIR OWN COLOR SCHEME.  THE GREEN GRASS AND TREE LEAVES ARE PINK AND PURPLE I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A DEBACLE OF COLOR REPRODUCTION.  IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT TREES IN OCTOBER ALL YEAR LONG.  OF COURSE THEY ALSO LACK AUDIO WHICH I NEW BEFORE I PURCHASED SINCE THE DVR I PURCHASED ALONG WITH IT HAS ONLY ONE AUDIO INPUT.  ALL IN ALL THE COLOR IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO THE EYE AND THE TWO NIGHT VISION PROBLEMS IS UNFORGIVABLE.  I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL CAMERAS AND HAVE NEVER SEEN A WIRED CAMERA GET SNOWY JUST BECAUSE THE INFRARED LIGHTS COME ON. I CAN'T AFFORD THE EXPENSIVE CAMS AND DVR'S SO I HAD TO BUY THESE CAMS DUE TO PRICE.  IF YOU CAN AFFORD BETTER, BUY BETTER BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT REALISTIC COLOR IN THE DAYTIME,OR FUZZY SNOWY PICTURE AT NIGHT, THESE ARE YOUR CAMS.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Night vision up to 30'\nConnects directly to your DVR\nCompatible with all Night Owl Systems\n400 TV lines of resolution", "Name": "Night Owl Security Products CAM-4PK-CM115 4 PK Wired Color Security Cameras with 240' of Cable", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E%2B-LDfBpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003S84FMA"}}
