{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A very good point and shoot for a great price", "Author": "Mom of 3", "ReviewID": "RW1YSMIVXBLWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an addition to our Minolta digital SLR, just to have a small and convenient point and shoot for times that I don't want to drag the SLR around.  Samsung has put together a very good camera for this price, and it has a couple of nice things beyond the basics.  I especially like the facial recognition feature, which makes sure that you actually get a focus on a person instead of sharp surroundings and a blurred human subject.  The menus are very easy to use, and the camera itself takes very good action shots.  There are eleven different photo settings from which to choose.  It also takes small video clips.  The photo quality is excellent and you can print up to poster size and maintain that quality.  It is an 8.1 megapixel camera with a 3x optical zoom and a 3x digital zoom.  The body of the camera itself is small and compact, and it easily fits into standard blue jean pockets.  It has a nice, solid feel to it and since I have small hands, it's very comfortable for me to use.  A person with very large hands may want something bigger for ergonomic reasons.  The only down side to this camera is that you have to use the LCD screen to take your shot.  There is no standard view finder.  The LCD screen itself, however, is very large and extremely crisp.  This is an excellent camera if you are looking for a basic point and shoot with a few added perks beyond the most basic category.  If you are looking for a camera with tons of settings, features and major zoom ability, you need to look elsewhere.  However, for basic everyday use, Samsung has really put out a great product in the S860.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "spotty performer . . .", "Author": "trebe", "ReviewID": "R1PED10YMV4790", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Samsung S860 is a low priced camera that is can produce clear images with vibrant colors, however results can be uneven and unsatisfactory.  Obtaining decent results, may require that you take some time to explore the camera's capabilities.Ideally, when set in auto mode, a camera should provide reliable results with a minimum amount of fuss and adjustment.  At this, the Samsung receives low marks.  In auto mode, I found that the camera's autofocus sometimes has issues.  It is very annoying to focus on the subject, lock on, and press the shutter button, only to have the camera fail to fire.  This seems to happen more often than average with the S860.  The results are a little better, using `Multi AF' instead of `Center AF', but in this mode the camera can have problems with selecting the proper subject or focus area.  ISO is automatically set by the camera according to the lighting conditions.  Unfortunately, in low light situations, ISO is often set too low, resulting in blurry images.  Also annoying, is that the flash function defaults to red eye reduction mode.  So if you were in autoflash, or flash off mode when you turned the camera off, it will reset to red eye reduction the next time it is turned on.  Being in red eye mode is not the best place to be, if you want to take a photo quickly.Auto mode may be suitable for outdoor situations with good lighting, but the best option for normal use is probably `P' (Program) mode.  ISO, white balance, sharpness and image quality can be adjusted in this mode.  The flash setting when the camera comes on is the same as when it was last turned off.  The focusing issues remain, but adjusting the ISO does improve the results.  However, when ISO is set to 800 or above, the camera takes 4 or 5 seconds to save the file to memory, and the noise in the images often increases significantly.In Manual mode your options are limited.  While a standard range of shutter speeds is available, only two aperture settings F2.8 and F8.4 can be selected.  The camera has many other modes and features, including macro and face detection.  The camera is capable of producing movies that are of acceptable quality, and you can get about half an hour of recording time on a 4GB card.The mode selection dial located on the top of the camera is too loose, and prone to being accidentally rotated (a small piece of adhesive tape is my simple solution).  Being familiar with Canon and Fuji cameras, I found the design and operation of the menu and settings not especially convenient to navigate.  The 2.4\" LCD is clear, and has good visibility in a bright light, though it is very prone to smudging.  Useful information like battery level, memory level, ISO, flash setting, metering mode and face recognition function can be displayed.As with many other cameras, the zoom function is controlled by a toggling button, located at the top right corner, on the rear of the camera.  If the zoom control was located by the shutter button, it would be much easier to operate the camera using one hand.  It can be done, but is a bit awkward attempting this with the S860.  The wrist strap could really use a locking ring.  It is a very small thing that could go a long way, if it keeps you from dropping your camera even once.The camera has a USB connection, but is not recognized by a PC.  Rather than loading in Samsung's software, you can use a card reader to download images.  The S860 uses AA batteries.  Setting the camera in powersaver mode helps to increase battery life, but carrying spares is highly recommended.  Because it uses AA batteries, the camera isn't super thin, but having a readily available power source can be very convenient.  There is a quick start pamphlet, but no printed manual included.  Samsung has a manual in PDF format available at their website.This is not a glowing review, but I already have several SLR's and point and shoots, and the S860 has enough good points, for me to decide to keep it as a walk around camera.  Even at the most basic mode, performance could definitely be better, but you do get a lot of features at a low price level.  As with any camera, it really depends on what is important to you, and how you like the results.  Feel is important as well, so getting one in your hands and trying it out, is always recommended.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEST DIGITAL CAMERA FOR THE MONEY! CLEAR, CRISP PICS AND GREAT VIDEOS IN AVI MODE!", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R36847WVXOUKRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "June 12, 2008 I bought this camera yesterday and I am totally overjoyed with it. Before I bought this one and found the RIGHT CAMERA for me, I returned a Kodak Easy Share camera to the store. Why did I do this? Well, the Kodak took great pictures, however, when you shoot a movie (video) it is saved in the MOV mode on the Kodak (Apple format, not Microsoft). So you have to download Quicktime to play a movie in the MOV mode on a Windows PC! Not fun. I wanted both a camera that is easy to just point and shoot for stills and also wanted the AVI video output so when I downloaded my video card on to my PC, I can instantly watch my movies! I found this perfect camera for me with this cute pink Samsung! On my first day I found that the basics of this camera were easy to learn. I used mostly the AUTO mode, and the camera does the work for me in any light! I took some stills in daylight and then inside both from faraway and also some closeups of flowers in my garden with the micro setting and later did an indoor and outdoor video. Everything came out just beautiful and as soon as I loaded my computer with the videos, I watched them from my PC. Plan to put these on a DVD to watch on TV. So far this has been an easy camera to learn for just the basic features that I need. My favorite feature is the clear videos that are saved in the AVI mode, not in the MOV mode. This AVI mode plays perfectly in my computer the Vista Windows Media Player and saves great to watch on a DVD on my TV. Note, that there are so many settings, I just use the AUTO and the DIC for low light and anti shake. By the way, it seems easy to use and does great micro shots as well. This is my newest camera after updating my older HP camera from near 3 years ago with just a 5 pixels. Another great feature I love is the FACE RECOGNITION. I took several pictures of friends and they came out just perfectly, NO RED-EYE and SKIN TONES were perfect. (With my old HP 5 pixel, the skin tones came out too red). My advice if you are looking for a good basic camera that takes great stills and videos, this is the one for you!", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "JonBoi567", "ReviewID": "R10UY3ZFZLWKTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I normally don't do reviews on products that i buy, but in purchasing this camera I was thoroughly impressed. I have my camera for alittle over a month and it is truly a luxury having it. It is a great basic camera for the average photographer. It has the basic features that is necessary to capture everyday photos and it still has the quality to do much more. The in-camera help option allows the user to trouble-shoot any problems that might occur while in use. I found that to be extremely helpful especially with change in low-light and bright lighting areas. The auto flash and face recognition features are definetly and added bonus to the cameras already impressive design.One flaw that I would have to point out is that it does run off of AA battery which gets decent life out of, but can be annoying constantly searching for new ones.Overall the camera is a great buy, especially for the price. There are not many 8.1 Mp cameras out there that can offer everything that this one can...", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "A 24 hours a day keep-it-with-you-at-all-times camera", "Author": "Rolf Bertram \"RolfBertramDotCom\"", "ReviewID": "R2K14FXTBVNEP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I uploaded a grasshopper photo in the samples gallery for this camera. I was surprised to see it as sharp as the photos from my Digital SLRs, except some minor jpg artifacts in the blurred background. This photo was taken at full superbright Florida daylight, meaning short shutter speed and hight apperture value. This makes shake free images and long depth of field easy, even handheld. The camera was set to macro mode, with is a one-touch button and therefore quickly activated.For professional photography I use a digital SLR, and I published books on Amazon with images from my digital SLRs. But those cameras are huge and heavy. This tiny samsung, in case logic strechy bag, is as small as a wallet. I used it for family trips, and to copy documents from pinboards. Much faster than writing down, or searching for a copy machine. Press the macro button, click done. Press the view button, zoom button, to check the image sharpness, off, done. For family photography it's great. The skin tones come out natural. For long exposures just find a table, a fence post or use the ground, to hold the camera firmly with one hand, and press the shutter button with the other. Night shots of fireworks with 4 second exposure time are easy this way. Alkalines lasted 100 to 150 pics without flash. A 2GB SD holds almost 500 pics at 8MP.A little scary is, that the on button is not a slide, but a press for 2 seconds. The lens will zoom out, and if that happens inside a tight camera bag, will the lens mechnism survive this? Also, the camera switches on, whithout lens coming out, if pressing the play button. But it has a auto-off mode.One strange effect happened, when the batteries were low, but still working witout flash. When activating the flash, the camera switched off without pulling the lens in! Well, switching it on and off again pulled the lens in. Anyway, makes sense to always have an extra set of fresh batteries.Using Lightroom to pull shadows or squeeze highlights is pretty much not of much use. This camera optimizes the image already pretty much to the maximum possible. And the dynamic resolution is just not there for further such editing. Be it due to sensor or A/D or jpg noise.I personally print from this camera 2 prints on one 4x6, so each print is 3x4\", which matches the aspect ratio of the sensor, and also at this small size pretty much all images, handheld or not, are sharp.Following is a link to my book about Suntan adjustment in Lightroom and Photoshop.

It works well both inside and out, in bright sun or overcast. It's small enough to carry in a purse or pocket, and so far appears pretty durable.

Fuji was going to charge me almost the same to fix it.  So I thought I would spend that money on a better camera.  This camera is so wonderful.  It is an 8.1 megapixel and only cost me $88.00 total.  I am so happy with this camera.  It takes such clear, crisp pictures.  I have a 5 year old daughter and she doesnt like to sit still and the shutter speed is fast enough to where I can take a great picture of her before she moves.  It also takes wonderful videos, It has two different size of videos 640x480 and 320x240.  The videos are clear and the sound on it is awesome.  It has a few effects to add to your pictures too.  You can make your pictures, black and white, sepia, red, green, blue, negative, and you can customize your own color.  You can view your pictures in a slideshow right on the camera.  You can choose from 5 different slideshow effects and 3 different music tones.  It is really cool.  I love this camera so much.  It has a lot of great features for such a low price.  The face detection is great also, it lets you know if the face isn't in focus.  And it helps alot when you take a self portrait.  It is so easy to use.  My 5 yr. old daughter uses it without any problems.  She can change it from still pictures to video in a snap.  So if you are looking for a great camera that takes awesome pictures, awesome videos, for a low price...I suggest you give this camera a try.

I go through two in about a day of average picture taking. It also has this strange thing when you are finished taking a picture. Most cameras take about a second to process the picture. For some reason, this camera takes anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds per picture. So, if you are into fast picture taking, this is not the camera for you.About the only good thing it does, is it takes really nice pictures. But, you have to have the flash on, have a steady hand, and be willing to wait for it to process. The steady hand thing on the camera doesn't actually let you take a picture with a shaky hand and have the picture come out clear. It just tells you that it is trying to take a clear picture. The picture will still come out blurry, just not as blurry as it would if you were using a film camera. The macro feature isn't the best. You are better off not even trying with it.Now let's talk about getting the pictures off of your camera. If you have an SD card reader, that is great, use it. Otherwise, don't lose the cable that comes with it. If you do, good luck trying to find a replacement. It isn't your standard camera cord. The connection is much smaller than normal and must have its own cord.The video feature is ok, it just doesn't work with VLC or Windows Media. The sound only works on the camera and be prepared to talk really loud to have the camera even record it. And no special features like high speed. It is just a regular video camera.If this is your first camera, it is a good one to get started on. It will teach you to be patient and will help you get to know the standard camera features.

This is not the most wear-friendly camera out there, but it was a good price for my first digital camera. There are enough features to satisfy a new photographer. My complaints are concise: the batteries tended to wear out too quickly for my taste, so I always had to bring along PLENTY of spares. The \"movie\" feature is right above the \"auto\" button, which is what I kept my camera on most of the time. The dial would pivot in its case, resulting in frequent \"accidental movies\". Also, the flash has to reload before it will let you view your pictures. This is extremely inconvenient, because after a picture, you generally have people crowded around you, waiting to see the picture. Lastly, the flash loaded far too slowly for decent action shots, even though putting the camera on \"child\" mode helped a little bit. Lastly, the shutter would sometimes catch, resulting in a black shadow on the screen. Touching the shutter doors lightly with a finger amended the situation, but it was confusing until I figured out what had happened. Ultimately, this is a good starter camera. It takes good pictures and is an unobtrusive device to carry with you. I always copied my photos over manually from folder to folder on my computer because it's simply faster that way.

My last camera, a Canon A70, was ruined by the constant banging around, even in its case.  This Samsung is by no means as good as the Canon, but it's a very good little camera for the price.  The resolution is excellent when in bright light.  Beach photos were beautiful when the subjects were in the sun.  When in the shade of an umbrella, they were a little too dark, even when the focus boxes on the viewfinder showed it should have been metering for the shade.  But I was able to lighten them with Corel Photo Pro.  Photos of water splashes were caught in mid air and in focus, not blurred.There is a lag time between when you press the button and when the photo is taken, even after you've pressed halfway to focus.  Much slower than my Canon.  That lag time is my main complaint with this camera.  Outdoor, it's not too much of a problem.  But I had a heck of a time photographing my granddaughter on an indoor carousel.  I had to take the photo about 2 seconds before she would be in front of me.

I instantly fell in love with it! Best part is, it runs off of AA batteries, so I can just carry extras with me instead of having to always recharge it like you'd have to with one of those lousy li-ion powered cameras.It is great that the functions are on a spin wheel on the top. It makes everything extremely easy to access in a hurry (which for a spur of the moment photographer like me, is very handy). It has a great array of features, which allow you to take great photos in nearly every situation. My favorite is the macro mode. It also has a \"manual mode\" on it, which offers a small range of manual aperture/shutter speed settings you can set. Few point 'n shoots offer such a feature, and if you know how to use it correctly, it can be really great to have. In general the pictures it takes are terrific, and I have one shot that I've taken with it that I've had blown up to an 11x14 print that has won me enough money in contests to more than cover the price of the camera!The video mode on it is fairly decent, though I prefer my Flip Ultra camera for making short movies and such. The one downfall to the video mode on the Samsung s860 is that if you use the zoom function while taking a video, it will momentarily mute your sound while you are zooming in.All in all, one of the best purchases I have made. I would recommend you buy a case for it though. I regret not having done that, as after three years of heavy use and being bumped around in my purse often, the screen broke. Unfortunately now that this camera is out dated, it was very hard to find another of this model being sold new. I had to pay $132 for my new one, as opposed to the $85 I paid for my original one, but to me it is worth it.

Since it was a very inexpensive camera it wasn't a total shock and the good news was that it was covered under warranty. HOWEVER, dealing with Samsung trying to get it fixed, was nightmarish. They sent the fixed camera to the wrong person's home and I received someone else's camera. This is the truly amazing part: It took over 6 weeks to get the problem rectified. And during those weeks, I spoke with numerous customer service people who never knew what was happening in other Samsung departments. The reps couldn't just call them either. It always required emails and time for the depts to respond. No one was ever held responsible for fixing the problem. Sometimes my calls to Samsung trying to follow up on this were dropped. Anyway, this is the short version and as you can see, if you buy this low end camera, you risk dealing with Samsung and THAT is just too risky if you value your time.

You must read the manual to learn its many features if you never used a digital camera. Set the `Mode dial' to AUTO, insert two alkaline AA batteries made for digital cameras, then push the `Power button'. The manual explains how to set the Date/Time and Languages (any of 22 languages). You should read the pages on using the camera buttons to take still photographs. The LCD monitor shows the settings for this camera. The `Size' and `Quality' affect the size of the photo file and the number that can fit on a given memory card. The `Setup Menu' adjusts each option (such as date and time). You should install the application software before downloading pictures to your PC. To use rechargeable 2500mAh Ni-MH batteries you must identify them in the `Setup Menu'. This camera has features that make it better for younger users (face detection). It can also record short movies with sound.If you choose `2048x1536' for `Size' and `Fine' for `Quality' the photo files will need about 841Kb of file space. The VGA setting uses 148Kb of space. You can delete unwanted photos from the memory card. This card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries that are too weak for this camera can be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras. If the batteries are weakening an indicator will show less than 3 bars. If the batteries are too weak the camera will shut down, or the screen will just go blank with the lens extended. You must put in fresh batteries to recover and turn the camera on or off. Like other delicate electronic devices, dropping it on a hard surface may cause expensive damage. The cable that connects the camera to a USB terminal is different from the ones in earlier models.If you removed the batteries earlier check the settings for date and time so they are correct. The installation software requires a Pentium or AMD K6-2 with Windows 98, 98SE, 2000, Me, XP, or newer system. To install a memory card first turn off the camera and open the cover. The front of the memory card faces the front of the camera, the pins on the card face the back. You must format the memory card before use. This will also delete all photos on the memory card. If you used the built-in memory you may want to copy its pictures to the memory card. [The manual could use more explanations for a new user.

So even tho I loved the first one and I do have many many awesome photos from the next two it still isn't as good as the first. I have had people ask what type of camera I use because I have taken SO many great shots with such a cheap camera and only 3x zoom.Having said all that it is such an easy camera to use and so inexpensive and when it takes a good photo I mean it is better than good! I have taken a lot of great shots from the other two but I don't want a camera to mess up or freeze up when I am focused on something. I want to simply take the photo.To sum it up I reckon you are taking your chances when purchasing this particular camera.

It is a very inexpensive camera and is suitable for taking quick snapshots of people about three meters or further.  On the other hand, it is horrendous at taking pictures of things VERY closeup.  About 1-2 feet away, pictures will look blurry when even using the correct camera options.  Pictures at extreme closeups of less than a foot away will turn out completely blurry.The flash is actually very good - I have taken pictures of quite small rooms in near complete darkness and you would think it was daytime if it weren't for the shadows.  The flash also drains the batteries so be careful.  I remember playing with it the first day and the batteries were done after only 25-40 photos.  Though, batteries are cheap so no worries... And carry extras with you!!It is very easy to copy pictures off the camera.  All you need to do is plug it in to a computer using the included USB cable, and your computer should recognize it as an external drive.  There may be additional software, but it is definitely optional.I am giving this camera a rating of two stars.  I first experienced problems on a long vacation where I took over 300 photos.  About every 10 to 20 of them were corrupt jpeg images, but that may have been a problem with the SD card.  One night I used it to take a couple more pictures, but the next day it wouldn't even cut on and the shutter does not come out, but a green light turns on if I hold the power button down (the batteries are new).  So, the camera worked for about half a year and was good for roughly 1000 photos.In conclusion, I would recommend spending a bit more money and getting a better digital camera.

I own high end P/S and SLR cameras and I wasn't expecting much for this price. Let me tell you this camera greatly exceeded my expectations. It has a lot of high end P/S camera features. It is the first camera that I have seen that allows you to zoom while using the video. It does take a little longer to write to the SD card after taking a picture than any other camera I've owned but that's a minor annoyance, maybe a faster SD card could cure that. The features are easy to use and intuitive. The screen is a nice size and clear. It's a very small size camera and one you can take anywhere as it will fit in pocket or purse easily. All in all its a very good camera at a very good price and I highly recommend it. One major annoyance with this camera is that when you turn it on it will always go to the red eye reduction flash setting and will flash 2-3 times before taking the flash picture. This will cause you to miss the picture you want as after the first flash fires, you will think the picture was taken and you will move the camera. The camera does not remember the last flash setting you had when you turned it off. It's a real pain to have to fool with the flash settings every time you turn this camera on, unless you like red eye reduction every time you turn it on.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "THis camera is a piece of crap!", "Author": "CW \"CW\"", "ReviewID": "R1B768SQIGY9ME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas.

An excellent buy!**UPDATE TO INITIAL REVIEW - this should be a 1star camera**DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!After only 5 mths of having it, it has stopped working (we can not turn it on), I also had recommended this camera to a friend of mine and hers stopped working within the same week as mine did - I am now going back to my trusted and true Fuji to buy a replacement for my son - what a waste of money!!", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent price & performance ratio", "Author": "Software Professional", "ReviewID": "R4EFO9675IIIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mean what one would expect from camera under $100 clear & excellent picture.

Roth \"twroth\"", "ReviewID": "R1VOKL4HT927PL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A nice camera at a nice price, the Samsung comes with almost no printed material. A \"quick start\" guide is all, and the huge manual in a dozen languages is on the software disc so that if you want to learn how to operate it in its many, many modes you're going to sit in front of your CRT and learn with Adobe Reader. Is that convenient? No.It comes with almost no internal memory so right off you have to invest in an SD card; another $15 at least. Rechargable batteries/charger: another $10-15.A very nice feature is the movie mode. The 3x zoom isn't as much as you may think, either. There's no optical view-finder so be prepared to use the screen ALL the time and thus burn through batteries faster.If you're looking for a point-and-shoot camera, this isn't it. If you're willing to spend hours reading the Adobe-based manual and playing with it to get the most out of its potential, I'm sure it takes great photos. Why it needs so many choices just for the sound it makes when it alerts you to shutter or other things it does is beyond me.

The first night out i dropped it.  The second time i took it out it was freezing up, likely due to the first time i dropped it.

I didn't need anything amazing, just something that works and produces a clear image. I purchased this Samsung S860 because I have had good luck with Samsung products in the past and the price was sweet for how many megapixels it had. When I got it home, I fired it up and the first things I noticed was the staticky viewscreen. I could see what I was pointing at, but it was pretty fuzzy. Not a big deal so long as the picture quality was alright. The camera build quality also seemed very lacking. I felt like if I dropped it even a few inches it would crack and break. Doesn't feel nearly as sturdy as it looks on Amazon. The three pictures I took, two of them were acceptable and one of them either I didn't get the focus right or it didn't take a good picture. I'm no master of a camera so it's possible I just wasn't using it right. The buttons on the camera did not seem logical to a new user and I couldn't figure out how to delete pictures I've taken without resorting to the manual. Up to this point, I'm still satisfied though. I install the Samsung drivers on my PC so I can download my images. Plugging in the USB cable alerted me to a complete lack of quality in the plug itself. Its shaped so the plug can only go in one direction, but after the second time I tried plugging it in, the metal had become bent along with the prong on the inside. Still was able to get it to plug in, but now it's too tight and I really have to look close and make sure its going in the right way. Still, I wasn't prepared to curse my purchase, so I left the camera on the USB plug overnight. When I took it off in the morning, I tried turning on the camera and all that happened was the lens extended out but the viewfinder did not turn on and the power light did not stay on. I tried turning it back off but nothing would happen, the lens was still extended. Removed the batteries to try again, and still nothing. The camera would no longer power on or completely power off. Very frustrated, I call Samsung technical support. They had me remove the batteries for 30 seconds and try again, and still nothing. But before they would be willing to service the camera, they told me I was going to have to buy new batteries and see if that fixes it. Sorry, but I'm not spending any more money on this so I have already packaged it back up and am returning it to Amazon. I guess I'm just going to have to spend more money on a different brand camera.I didn't need much from this camera, but it failed to deliver even the basics, so I do not recommend this camera to anyone who wishes for more than a paperweight.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "Marcelo Teixeira", "ReviewID": "R3GJE2S5Q0V4PL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Gave the camera as a gift.

No one stole it. Learning the basics, I took about 300 pictures in a month. Some of them were awful but that was mostly me. It wants to take good pictures, you just have to learn how to let it do so, read the manual, stuff like that. It also took some very hard travel knocks and kept working. The view screen is a bit dim in bright light, but you learn to shade it with your hand. My first set of AA batteries lasted me over 120 pictures. Still a record. It won't work at all on lesser batteries than top-end alkalines. The computer download software looked hinky but works fine. It cost me $80 with a 2 gig chip.
