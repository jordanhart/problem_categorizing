I want a fun, have a camera ready on the fly type of scenario...Yes, its not a DSLR CANON or a NIKON or you would have bought one. So dont expect the same here. You get what you pay for and remind you this is ONLY a $230.00 camera...NOT A $1100 Canon with all the bells and whistles.I have read many terrible reviews for this Fujiflm camera. But for me, I LOVE this camera for the PRICE and for just GENERAL USE - not pro use...its great for being with the family and not concerned about shutter speed...Its a great \"family\" camera. The picture quality of the camera great. Outdoors and Indoors. The zoom 30x is incredible, and VERY STABLE at 30x too..WHILE HOLDING IT! Very clear shots and you cant do that with a Canon unless you are on a tripod. The HD video is great too.The Panorama setting is very cool. I love the wide angle screen shot. Video is great. Only thing I have found so far that is not to my liking is if you leave the lens cap on, the camera will tell you there is a problem and forces you to turn off the camera and on again. You just cant take the lens off and go. You have to shut it down. Not a big deal but annoying.Picture quality is beautiful I think. For a simple point and shoot with HD Video and Panoramic viewing PLUS a 30X zoom...its AWESOME! MY Canon will not allow zooming in ideo mode where this camera will. You can ZOOM in and out while taking great video and the sound is great too.Just a few drawbacks I can mention are:There are some modes the camera has where the colors look \"different\", but still CLEAR and FOCUSED, which I care about more. The intensity and shading seems \"off\" a little, but so what? ITs FUN in the SUN and most people want to see their little girl in the pool with Grandma, or their son running the bases at the baseball game. (zoomed in too!)One other drawback is the PLASTIC. 80% of it is plastic so dont drop it. Or that will be the end of it. I have not done that yet, but fair warning just the same. Another drawback is where they placed the slot for the memory card, which is in the battery compartmant. Why didnt they leave an open slot somewhere else on the side rather than there? So you have to remove the battery lid to get to the card which I really dont like at all.At any rate, the pluses are the 30x zoom, decent pics indoor and outdoor, panaoramic mode, HD video, and is HDMI compatible.Better than a point and shoot and FAR less than a DSLR. I put this camera in the \"Very Good for the money camera category UNDER $250.Hope this helps!!Lee", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm S4000", "Author": "hiker28", "ReviewID": "RP2ECSMFQ42NA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!  I purchased this camera to replace an older model high-end point and shoot.  It has a 30X zoom lens that allows you to get photos from a distance that are sharp and clear.  I consider myself decent amateur photographer.  I hike a lot and take the camera with me all the time.  Landscapes and wildlife are my most common types of photos.  On my first outing with the camera, I was able to get a photo of a bald eagle that was at least 1000 feet away.  I especially like how much feedback the camera gives you while focusing.  It will tell you if the focus isn't correct, if the picture will be blurry, if someone blinked, and a lot more.  If you're used to using pocket point and shoot cameras, this will be an easy transition.  Two features I especially like are the electronic viewfinder and the use of AA batteries for power.  Using the setting for high resolution photos, I still get 300+ photos from one charging of the NiMh batteries.  While this camera doesn't have the range of adjustability of an DSLR, it takes photos that look just as good.  My only disappointment is the camera software.  It isn't nearly as sophisticated as the camera.  My old Olympus camera software is about 5 years old and is far superior.  Fortunately, there's lots of photo software out there to use.  I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but slow indoors", "Author": "Razz", "ReviewID": "R2FLE6JWT9MGI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My critique is based on comparing the Fujifilm S400A to the Fujifilm HS10. All comparisons are also based on setting both cameras to Automatic mode. First let me say that both cameras take great outdoor pictures. Indoors is another matter. The S4000 is a lot slower then the HS10 in focusing and exposure settings. I also do not like the indoor auto white balance on the S4000, even with forced flash. The S4000 indoor pictures look yellowish. With the HS10, the flash is dominant and the pictures are more vibrant in my opinion. The resolution on both cameras is good (when the pictures are in focus).  The HS10 has much better and faster focusing.  The S4000 is not nearly as good. With the S4000 you have to take it slow when taking indoor pictures in order to get a focused picture. The motorized zoom on the S4000 is better then the HS10's lens for shooting video. The manual zoom on the HS10 will shake the camera when zooming so your video will look jerky. The S4000 zoom motor noise will be heard in the video unfortunately, but only slightly. The amazing plus for both cameras is when zooming in to the max and being able to hand hold the camera and get a perfect shake free picture. I took the HS10 to Hawaii and shot a light house at full zoom while sanding on a small boat. I got a great detailed picture.  I have also shot full zoomed in pictures with the S4000 and got great results. I am disappointed that the S4000 does not have a hot shoe or threads on the lens for a filter, whereas the HS10 has both.  Physically the S4000 smaller and much lighter then the HS10. For Video, the S4000 has a better video format, Motion Jpeg which is more compatible with editing software. The the HS10 has the terrible MOV format that I hate. I am sure I have not covered everything, I am a Nikon camera fan.  I bought these cameras for situations where I couldn't carry around my case of Nikon equipment.  I find myself wanting to carry both the HS10 and the S4000, perhaps I'll need another case for Fujifilm equipment. My Nikon camera, (D80) doesn't have a 30x zoom lens or does video, so that is another reason for using the Fujifilm cameras.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good camera for intermediate to advanced users.", "Author": "artknows", "ReviewID": "RI8WKOYCJCJRB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Fujifilm S4000 after disappointment with a compact high zoom camera from Olympus (VR310).  The S4000 was a bit of an impulse buy as I had not read any reviews.  After getting it home and reading reviews, I was confused.  Some are good, others not so much.  I decided to put the camera to use and try it out.I found that the camera is very suitable for my needs.  I like to shoot snapshots of friends and family either indoors or outside.  At times, I like to shoot landscapes, sports and wildlife.  In the short time that I have owned the camera I have found it meets my needs and mostly exceeds my expectations.No camera is truly automatic and can magically create a good photograph if conditions are poor.  The same is true of this camera.  If lighting is low (dusk) and I am utilizing the zoom too much (kids in the pool 30 feet away), then chances are the result will not be a great shot (well focused, but grainy).  If the subject is too far away from the flash, again no camera can compensate for that.  Notably, this flash is pretty strong and I would rate that as a \"pro\" for this camera versus most point and shoot cameras.Good images are the result of good conditions and knowing your equipment.  The S4000 is very easy to use and I read the entire manual in short order and felt I was well informed.  I have taken 400 images and some have been great. I have discarded some too, but mostly because the conditions were poor; not because of the camera.I have found the camera is reasonably fast at focusing, though slower at full optical zoom.  I think that is to be expected.  It also has a reasonably short shutter lag and recovers fast enough between shots.  I utilize a Fuji 4gb SD card that I formatted in the camera.There are many many features to the camera.  Too many to list here.  It has full manual settings as well as aperture preferred or shutter preferred auto settings.  There is a complete point and shoot auto setting too.  I usually use the P setting.In short, I am happy with my purchase.  You may like this camera if you have some photography experience and are willing to read the manual to learn about the equipment.  Nice job Fuji.  For the price, it is quite amazing that the camera is packed with so many features.  AND THE ZOOM?  Simply amazing.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's as Good as I Expected", "Author": "Gerald N.

However, the good reviews and my previous experience with Fuji (S7000 & A600), I decided to buy it. At first, I had some of the problems as previous reviewers. After reading the manual carefully and using the Full Automatic mode with flash (for indoors), my photos became clear and bright. Unless you are skilled at using the manual modes, stick to Full Auto (Not SR Auto) and flash for most indoor photos and this camera will not disappoint you.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible Camera!", "Author": "Bill Boone", "ReviewID": "R7EGLD5LOHDAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been around Photography about 45yrs. and have had allot of excelent equipment(Nikon)so I feel qualifyed to make these comments. I say that honestly not arrogantly. I was looking for a camera that had the capability to do what I require of it without allot of weight to carry around. I resarched this camera for two months bofore I ordered it in Dec. of last year. Whan it came I had already read the online manual from Fujifilm Global (and I highly suggest you do the same)so I knew about what to expect. So I thought! I have long been impressed with Fuji Lenses, but this camera absolutly floored me. First of all I was impressed with all the controls. This camera is loaded with all the great features I was looking for and a bunch more. This camera is as simple as you want it to be, or it can be as sophisicated as your mind can think. If you are a biginner or a pro, you will love this camera. I really like the light weight and size. It will fit in a coat pocket easily and when it is around your neck it's not a problem. I have put this camera to many tests that most people would never care about, but that's me. It passed all I put it through with streight A's. The lens on this camera will take your breath away. I tested it from the super macro through it's max telephoto and when I viewed the results I really could not believe my eyes. It was really that good. And yes, I am critical!!! When I got used to the camera (which is user friendly) and became fimilure with the controls, I was amazed at all that this race horse can do. I was really impressed with the three focus modes. They are HARD, SOFT, and STANDAD. They are refered to in the menue on the camera as \"Sharpness\". The \"HARD\", is mostly for taking shots of buildings and archecture. The \"STANDARD\" is for general shots that you take every day (excelent by the way) and \"SOFT\", which is mostly for taking portraits or shots where you might like to add a little \"MOOD\" to your shot. The \"INSTANT FOCUS\" features in this camera are really easy to use and will add to your many pleasures I assure you this camera will give you. I really, really, urge you to learn this as one of the first things you master, you will see why on your own! I have done some macro work with this camera as close as one inch from the lens while hand held, and the shots were super. (normally if you don't use a tripod these are hard to do)I would say the same for the telephoto end of this lens. Fuji outdid themselves with their \"Dual Image Stabilization\" system!! This camera has two fully atomatic modes where the camera dose all the thinking for you. The \"Fully Automatic Mode\" speaks for its self, and the results do also. The \"Scene Recognition\" (SR) mode will produce outstanding shots in all kinds of tough lighting shots. I use this allot if I am not sure of a scene. The \"MANUAL MODE\" is as good as any I have used. There are many many more features that I will not go into for times sake, but let me tell you this: \"This is all the camera you need.\" So why not 5 STARS? I only have a few remarks, not complaints! First, I wish it had a \"B\" Mode, but I can do without. Also, I don't know why there is no cable release, but the self timer will work just fine. The threaded hole for the tripod is plastic. I am used to metal so I get the feeling this is a weak link. But I could be wrong, since the body is plastic, and if you research this they (Fuji) claim to have used a \"High Impact\" plastic. I did not test this, nor do I plan to. I'll take their word and try not to drop it. In conclusion: For the money this is much more camera than I expected. Great optics, great features, great feel, great looks, and \"FABULOUS PICTURES\". One last thing: Go online and search \"Fujifilm Global\", look for the X4000 and then download the instruction manual. The book they send you is a typical hand book. The online manual is good and is worth your time to download specially if you are new to cameras. I have shot many frames through the years, but this little camera excites me to no end!!!

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R3AHRBZQ7OX7MH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a good starting point for learning digital photography and the modern DSLR. It can be simple or complicated, manual or automatic. If you take the the time to read the manual (going over all the options) you will discover it is a very versatile camera. (It will train you for the more expensive options at a fraction of the cost). The quality of the photos are professional but as a professional personally I can tell the difference of expensive equipment and budget equipment. I will say that it is comparable to more expensive cameras. I considered it a good buy and worth the small cost. I recommend this camera as a good value, good quality and good for learning the ropes at a lesser cost.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "very disappointed", "Author": "R. Gray \"Ridgetown Rick\"", "ReviewID": "R3JSDMTJCWY4DX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I too am a bit disappointed with this camera. Maybe I was expecting too much for the price. My biggest complaints are no override on the autofocus and the verrrrrrry slow response time from when you press the shutter till when it captures the image. I've had a few times where the camera just wouldn't focus on the right thing - e.g it focussed on a tree branch between me and the object and just would not focus on the object. If it's a fleeting opportunity for that special shot, it is extremely frustrating. And forget about trying to capture tricky action shots. By the time the image is captured, the action is long past. I even upgraded to an extremely fast (i.e. expensive) SDHC card because the sales clerk convinced me it was the slow write time to the other card but it barely made any difference. Apparently that was not the real problem.I do really like the ability to adjust shutter and/or aperture, and the super-macro function allows extremely close shots (a couple of cm), and the zoom and wide angle are pretty darn good. However, the panorama is just a gimmick - it works in super wide angle mode only, so your shots look distorted, and you can only capture a max of 3 images, so not a full circle. Would I buy it again? Not likely - I'd spend a bit more and get something that was faster.**This is a later addition to my above paragraphs. After less than 6 months of fairly gentle use, the icons on the selector dial are all rubbing off. When I sent it back for warranty repair I was told this was cosmetic and not covered under warranty. If it was the Finepix logo that had rubbed off, I would have said OK, but knowing what dial setting you are using is pretty important to the functioning of the camera. The poor materials used for this and the lack of support from Fuji means I will  never buy another Fuji Camera. I have a small Panasonic camera that has rattled around in knapsacks and in coat pockets with keys and change, has fallen down a mountainside and been trampled in the mud over a period of 4 years and the labels are as clear as the day I bought it! Not only that, but Panasonic has replaced under warranty things that were obviously the result of rough use (e.g. sand in the zoom mechanism, scratched lens) without a hesitation - and they paid the shipping both ways. With this new development on top of the issues I stated in my earlier review, I have downgraded my rating on this camera to a 1 star.****Final update. After visits to the place of purchase and calls to Fuji still got me no satisfaction for the premature wear on the dial, I went to Fuji's Facebook page and posted my concerns. The next day a Fuji rep contacted me and within a week I had a mail-in warranty. It's too bad I had to go that far. I am still using the camera, but I now know it's limitations and just don't expect much from it. To me, it's greatest strength is its super-macro, but I still leave the rating at 1 star.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing lost in translation...", "Author": "Mr. Higgle-Piggle", "ReviewID": "R16PJWEXIPCHP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Approximately 28-30 years ago I had a Pentax with a super-zoom lens and all of the kit that went with many professional cameras.

And then...I found the S4000. Albeit it is a point and shoot, this camera is still perfect for me.  It feels [and even looks] like a DSLR, but you don't need to be a professional to use it.

I was excited byt the 720mm zzom and the 14 megapixel resolution, but wondered where they havd skimped to get the price so low.  The answer is that it's very slooooooow.  They appear to have attached the new lens to an old box with the old processor from my first Fuji 8 years ago.  When you turn it on, it takes so long to boot that you wonder if you missed the button.  The zoom is only motor driven, not manual, so that takes longer to adjust.  Then, when you push to shoot, there is a long notticieable gap before it clicks.  The previous model with only 400mm zoom was so much faster.  This new camera doesn't work well for the candid wildlife phography that I do; by the time you get it on and adjusted, the animal is long gone.Also, it does not have manual focus option, so if the auto focus can't get what you're aiming at, you're SOL.When used on a tripod for [photos you can set up or wait for, it does a nice job.  This is a camera for scenery, or for working in a blind where you can sit and wait for the animals to come to you.

Only outside pictures come out proper.  All the others have white lines going through the colors, looks like you printed it on a cheap printer.  It is defective.After finally getting someone on the phone at Fuji to discuss and sending them examples of the pictures they have determined it is defective and have to send it in for a \"refurb\" replacement.  Not happy that a 2 month old camera will be replaced with a refurb but as long as it works, maybe I will be happy.  If it is not perfect I will complain to fuji directly.After having my last camera for 8 years with no problems until it got broken by the US Air I am very disappointed that this happened and now I will nto have a new camera but a refurb.Update:  Camera is not fixable!  But my biggest complaint with fuji is that they have had my camera now since January 10th (its March 12th) and this is the first time I hear that its unfixable and they will send me a refurb if I will accept one - but noone from Fuji contacted me , I called again and wanted to know where the camera is, then I get the c/s rep who says oh yeah its not fixable so they want to know if you want a refurb.  HORRIBLE customer service! After waiting 2 months, I will not accept a refurb only a new camera or a refund at this point.  Wonder how long before the manager gets back to me.Update 2 - after Fuji sent me a \"refurb\" that had the exact same problem with the pictures. That went back and then was told it was not fixable again.  I called to complain again and ask for a different camera as a replacement .  I was offered a $100 credit toward another camera which started at $500.  I said no send me another \"refurb\" which was again garbage.

I took some outside shots and they came out great.  I also took some shots inside and they came out good as well.  The key to getting the best shots out of any camera is making sure that you have proper lighting.  When I didn't have proper lighting, the shots of course came out a little grainy, however with proper lighting the indoor shots have a unique look and clarity to them that I really admire.

My favorite camera so far was the Sony CEX5 and for good reason. However never having enough money for these is a big difference.so that brings me to the point and shoots with some DSLR features. Canon has a few and Nikon as well, but most of those are looking at $400, and no BB employees do not have that great of a discount  even with some of the special offers made to employees. My attentions to the Fuji started when I noticed that all of the features of the $350-$500 cameras were being packed into $90-250 cameras.I have one of the $90 cameras(Fuji JX 310) for over a year now.

You can oversaturate you photos or undersaturate them. however you cannot add lenses to the camera like a UV or POlarizer.

After shooting for roughly 25 years - using multiple types and formats of cameras...I have to say - this is a nice little camera.  I can stow it in my pack's padded phone / ipod pouch & I'm done.  Even-though it's a bit bulky, I also like to keep it in a cargo pocket of jacket pocket when hiking & I am shooting a lot.I miss some features of a DSLR when using this.  But it's a trade-off.  Do I want to lug extra pounds of camera and equipment with me - or do I want to stow the S4000 and Gorillapod?  It's nice just to grab this and shoot.  After playing with it - the shots are more than acceptable.  The zoom lens equates to something in the realm of 720mm.  And it performs very well even under handheld conditions.  Bear in mind - with any zoom lens - the farther you zoom there is going to be a loss in light and a corresponding loss of image sharpness.  The zoom certainly gets softer in lower light conditions.  Have not tried the zoom beyond 70 or 80mm indoors, but from the reviews - looks like it follows suit.Learn how the various picture modes alter the image, how the camera focuses, how it sets f stop, shutter speed & you'll really get a kick out of using it.  There are also settings within the modes.  Meaning you can program the light temperature, ISO et al.  For example - trick the camera into seeing colder light so it compensates by saturating your image with richer colors as it 'warms' the image.Best results have been on sunny days.  But that's not to say I didn't get spectacular shots with cloud cover, stormy conditions and in low light.  My thinking from reading some of the negative reviews is this camera may not be for everyone.  If you enjoy photography & see taking time to learn the capabilities of a camera as a pleasure - you will probably fall in love with how simple this inexpensive little darling is.  If, on the other hand...you just like to point, shoot and move on - where learning how to get the most out of your camera is a source of frustration - this may not be the one for you.May have given this 4 stars because of simple ergonomic annoyances, but there may have been other design issues that prevented the positioning of these items.  The SD card in the battery compartment is a nuisance...as is the side facing microphone (for video).  The HDMI / A/V slots are also a nuisance on the right side.  They get in the way when connected to computer / tv.Beyond that - the viewfinder in addition to the lcd screen is HUGE for me, lcd is nice - but viewfinder is nicer when working on image composition & in bright light.  The image review, panorama, HD video, macro and zoom all do much more than I ever expected them to do in a $200ish machine.  So if you'e like me and don't like to feel as though you're outfitting for an expedition every time you head out for a hike, walk, outing, whatever...and still want a camera compact and versatile enough to take some great images - this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "You can do better", "Author": "Douglas Silver \"Seismic Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R179PKMR83DZZT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In my SLR film days I was always partial to Canon but I have been a fan of Fuji cameras going back to their Discover line film days and also digital models.  My first serious digital was a Fuji S7000 which provided great images and was great bang-for-the-buck.  I followed that up with an S1000fd, then S9000 (my favorite), and most recently the S4000.  I did not need another camera but I was attracted by the S4000's great zoom range and appealing price.  I have to say that this is the first camera I have owned where bad images were clearly the fault of the camera and not the photographer.  I used the S4000 on a recent vacation and virtually all of the images showed some blurriness/fuzziness along the left 20% (more or less) of the image.  I later discovered that others buying this camera had similar problems (do a google search with the words S4000 and blurry).  I sent the camera to Fuji and emailed some sample images.  The claimed to have repaired the camera and sent it back but it was apparent that NOTHING was done.  I sent it a second time and they replaced the lens.  The results are now better but there is still a minor amount of fuzziness at the lower left corner of images.It has also been widely reported that the images you get sometimes have a \"painted\" look to them.  It is hard to explain but when you see it you know what it looks like (do a google search for the words S4000 and painted).In any event this is probably an okay camera for the price but those with a critical eye will be disappointed with the quality of the resulting images.

She always wants to take nature shots while we are camping but could never get close enough to really get a good picture.Although we have not had the camera but for a few days and too cold to go camping, we did take a trip through the woods and got some great shots of some geese on a pond several hundred feet away.The 30X zoom is great. I always shake too much to get good shots but the image stabilization seems to work very well at full zoom.We also used this camera for the family pictures during Christmas and the timer function is pretty cool. It actually shows the 10 second count down in the view finder. This leads me to another plus. The view finder is great when you're outside. It is often so hard to see the image on the screen because it is too bright outside and this view finder takes that problem away!One other option I found to be of interest is the option of changing the image size. You can take the normal picture at 4:3 aspect ratio or switch it to a 16:9 aspect ratio as I did when we took the family pictures at Christmas. I was able to get over 20 people in the picture and the image quality looks great!There are still a lot of different settings on the camera that we have not even touched yet.I have read other post's about the lens cap.

Perhaps the greatest con is that you cant fix a UV filter (to protect the lens). But all these are, at least for me, minor problems. The pros, including the price of course, exceed by far the cons.

The day after the concert we went to Navy Pier in Chicago and a dropped my camera:( IT WAS JUST FINE! i dropped it directly on the lens and the only thing is that the outer rim of the lens (the metal part) has a scuff on it, and my lens cap is broke, but that's minor stuff, my camera still works like normal as i haven't found anything wrong with it!

The Fuji Software works with Formats AVI, also Finds and Works with  MPEG2, and MPEG4 that you may have on your Computer from other Cameras a very big plus..  (The Cons) The Camera is slow to focus indoors. The Camera has a very noisy zoom motor you can hear in the movie and the mono sound is not even close to the quality of older models ( Maybe I had a defective Camera? Did anyone else notice this?)..

For the money, it is very versatile, especially the telephoto / macro capability. Several reviewers complain about pics taken indoors, esp. that lag time is a problem, and that the  pics all turn out with a yellowish tint. One of the settings on the mode dial is labeled 'SP'. This setting is for 'natural light' and should be used when there is a decent amount of natural light for indoor pictures. This mode turns off the flash, and thus prevents harsh lighting problems or a yellow cast of the subject which often results from using a flash indoors. Yes, there is a lag time indoors while the camera focuses and  processes the exposure info, however, I have taken a number of shots of my cats indoors, and even when they are moving some when I  press the shutter, when the picture is actually taken the image is not blurred! This setting is also particularly useful when taking pics in museums, as many pieces of art are sensitive to the energy of photons (it degrades the paint and canvas), and in decent light you don't even need a tripod! There are some limitations with this camera: some aspects of exposure are not options in certain modes, can't attach a filter on the front, no hot shoe, no attachment on the shutter for a shutter release. But overall I have been impressed with the ease with which this camera takes telephoto pics and indoor pics without a tripod. Since there is no attachment for a mechanical shutter release, the self timer has to suffice when taking pics that might benefit from such a release, as for example a macro or extended telephoto shot. Also, there is no hot shoe for the flash, so you can't bounce the light for a softer effect, nor can you use a cord that would allow you to locate the flash off to one side, as is often useful in macro photography when highlighting depth. I cannot testify to the durability of the camera, though mine has been fine for 2 yrs.. Nor do I seem to have lens distortion on the left side of the pics, as reported by another reviewer. Moreover, the pics on the LED back are generally sharp, and produce good prints. All this from a guy who used Mamiya RB 67 (medium format camera), Nikon F2, multiple lenses, took professional photography courses at local trade school, etc...

It essentially did this job, because it Can take really nice photos - it's great for outdoors shots, and generally good for action shots (when not put on the action setting) and has a strong flash for night photos... But it does poorly indoors; the quality is not good. And I was hoping to buy something that would be good for nature shots because I want to be an animal photographer, but I will have to get a new camera for that - it can take good scenary pictures, but wild animal shots have not worked out well. (Blurry, takes to long to capture.)The zoom is nice too.Overall, a fantastic camera for the price, but I was hoping it would be the last one I would buy, but I don't think it's going to be because it's not perfect.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Camera", "Author": "Paul Jacobson", "ReviewID": "RIMHCKZWJEYYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was ok except for a novist camera persons, the camera had way more features than I needed.

I haven't used many settings, just the regular general setting and it works pretty well. The zoom is incredible and takes pretty good quality even at such an extreme zoom. It turns on quickly. Shutter speed is fine when the flash is off, like when you're outside, but if you're using the flash it is a very slow shutter speed. So it's hard to get the picture right at that perfect moment indoors. That would be the one thing I think is annoying so far.

Combining Optical Zoom 201 x Digital have, but for me it is not as useful as it once you get past the 30X, and the camera begins to use the digital zoom be seeing more blurred the picture, but for crisp up a 60X going well.Panorama: The camera has two modes of picture one more automatic and conventional where one has to frame the photo.Smile: This mode automatically when a smile takes the picture, I think in good usefulnessFinder: perfect and very useful if you want to turn off the LCD screen, really tremendous feature to save battery power.Exposure time up to 8 seconds, perfect for taking pictures on highways, rivers, waterfalls! who would not want times of minutes and hours, but for this camera with 8 seconds is enough, you can take good photos ...In short I find very good camera for the price, low-light photos are not the best, but almost no perfect camera to take less than that is professional slr. the only thing I would have liked is that had the zoom lens in the housing as the Nikon L810, the rest phenomenal!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "camara", "Author": "oswaldo avilan", "ReviewID": "R1Y9IXKFR4YTS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent seller good articles that you can say fantastic, very happy with everything, amazon existence of the maximum. thanksFujifilm FinePix S4000 14 MP c\u00e1mara digital con Fujinon 30x lente s\u00faper gran angular zoom \u00f3ptico y pantalla LCD de 3 pulgadas", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can I rate the S4000 lower?", "Author": "William N.

The S4000 is a POS it takes 2+ seconds in automatic mode to actually take the photo I can deal with this but any sort of indoor photo has streaking horizontal lines.  Now I am no camera pro and acknowledge that but myself and my wife work in Tech and we know our way around a camera.  So we did the smart thing consult several family members who are Professional photographers who spent an hour tweaking every setting to no avail.  Their take the camera is defective.So Fuji warranty was contacted to fix a 2 month old camera that was used 2 times.  It was sent back to Fuji and after no contact they did nothing but waste over a month of time under warranty and send back the same Broke camera with same problems.Now I am sending it back again, They better get their act together because I live 10 mins from the place we are shipping it back to and my wife is very angry.  You REALLY don't want to make another mistake FUJI trust me on this...BTW:  I won't be purchasing any more gifts on Amazon by the time I gave this gift to her over half the 30 day return period from amazon was over and then by the time she opened it and did more than just place batteries in it we were out of time.

I was looking at Nikons and Sonys but wanted to save about $100.00 dollars with this Fujifilm.I read one hundred plus reviews on it. Most people said they liked all the fancy settings and things that could be done with it. However, there was a prevailing theme that kept coming up, it took blurry pictures, especially inside and at night. Most of the reviewers put this off to people not understanding the settings. I did not heed my first instinct to buy one of the Nikons or Sonys. This camera is a waste of my money. Yes it does take blurry pictures inside and at night. And no, I do not want to take a camera class to learn how to adjust my camera. I went back to my little sony 12.0 megapixel digital camera that I have used without issue for years. It has 6 or 7 settings that do not involve manual adjustment of the exposure, f stop and so on. It takes clear pictures. If you absolutely have to have a fancy camera with super optical zoom on it, do not buy this one.
