When I did, I found the battery life to only last approx 15 min.  So when I went to return it, I had just past the warranty return date...ugh.  I did contact the Seller, they said I have to contact the BATTERY PEOPLE...too much to do for an expensive purchase.  Not at all accommodating.Also, for me, it is too complicated.  I wanted to just plug and transfer the pictures to my computer...I would look around before buying this from Beach Camera.  I did buy the extended warranty and will see what they can do.Very frustrated.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "PowerShot ELPH 530 HS Black Camera\n16GB Micro SD Memory Card\nNB9L 1000MAH LI-ION Battery, Ultra-Compact Digital Camera Deluxe Carrying Case\nMemory Card Wallet, 57-in-1 USB 2.0 High Speed Memory Card Reader\nFlexible Mini Table-top Tripod, 3 Pack LCD Screen Protectors, 3pc.
