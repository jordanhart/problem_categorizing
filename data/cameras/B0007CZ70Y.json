{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the best compact digital cameras on the market...", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R2PE2PKV3BHO9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this as a replacement from my Sony P-100 5 mega pixel camera. WOW! This camera is definitely a sleek improvement from past models. Aside from the 7.2 megapixel count, this camera excels in almost every conceivable area relevant to compacts.First off, this camera starts up in less than a second or so--truly fast compared to other similarly priced cameras. This feature is essential when attempting to capture that oh so special kodak...er...sony moment in a blink.Secondly, the camera is beautiful. Sony got it right this time when designing a sturdy, compact and lightweight technological masterpiece. True, it's not as small as its even lighter cousin--the T-33, or the Pentax Optio S5n and Casio Exlim models, but it passes the pants pocket test with flying colors. Additionally, when compared to the T-33, this camera uses the regular memory stick size and not the smaller duo like the T-33. Sooooo, if you already own a sony, this is a natural upgrade.Some other excellent features on the P-200 are the manual overides. You can adjust the shutter speed and aperature which, for a camera in this class, is a true rarity.I also am enjoying the extremely high quality video mode; although not the most important selling point, having the ability to take camcorder like videos with sound for unlimited amounts of time (unlike 30 second segments from many other cams) is handy.Another amazing feature is the battery life. I remember my first sony digital camera--the DSC-P50 2.1 mega pixel. It's battery life was dismal. My P-72 was slightly improved, but still suffered from chronic battery munchies. The P-200 fully charged can take pictures for over 200 minutes! If you're on the display modes, it can last almost double that--another breathtaking accomplishment. The info lithium works well in calculating the remaining battery life--a major complaint from owners of other cameras like Canon that lack this feature. Lastly, it is a proprietary battery, so purchasing an additional one is recommended.Needless to say, the 2\" lcd is gorgeous, just like the past sony cameras I've had. It's extremely hi-res and I have no difficulty seeing it in sunlight. The lcd's navigation is similar to earlier sony cams with a few new additions. Sony finally placed a protective screen over the actual lcd to prevent damage...took them long enough, but it's much appreciated.Overall, I'm tremendously pleased with the picture quality from this puppy. I envision this camera lasting well into early-mid 2006 when Sony will release yet another improvement. Until then, I highly recommend this for most anybody who appreciates quality and functionality incorporated into a lightweight package.", "Date": "February 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Probably my last camera for a while", "Author": "maxxpwr \"maxxpwr\"", "ReviewID": "R3MQ4TXOM92BB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought my old Olympus C50 was going to be my last digital camera for a while, but then the P200 was released as an update to the already-excellent P150 and I convinced myself to buy it.I think Sony did a great job on this camera.  It is perfect for those who are tech savvy but really appreciates technology when it is used to make something better without making it cumbersome to use.The Sony DSC-P200 is first and foremost a point and shoot camera designed to capture every-day life images and the occasional video. To best serve that purpose, it is compact, easy to use, and have an exceptionally quick turn-on time. It's not the smallest camera, but it is compact enough to fit inside small pockets, and substantial enough to be easy to hold. Sony cameras, like most Sony brand products, have excellent user interfaces that are logically laid out and easy to comprehend.  I figured out out to use my P200 without reading the manual.  I will probably refer to it to see exactly what the scene modes are but that's about it. The large 2 inch LCD on the P200 also makes it much more user friendly than smaller 1.5 or 1.8 inch displays.  The turn on time for this camera is one of the best, probably somewhere around a second between pressing the power button to being able to snap a picture.  My old Olympus C50 took 3-4 seconds and it was a real bother.Ease-of-use points aside, this is a 7.2 Megapixel camera and it packs a picture-quality punch that is surpassed only by high end cameras such as the SLR variety.  Untill full reviews come out on one of the well known digital camera review sites, I think it is adequate to use reviews for the P150 as a guage.  Those reviews have all been very positive on the P150 and the P200 is at least as good as the P150 in terms of picture quality.Some words about blurrness...I've heard/read about Sony digital cameras taking blurry pictures and all expert opinion attribute the blurrness to two things: image processor, shaky hand/mount.There are only a few Sony digital cameras that suffer from blurry pictures caused by an image processor that is too agressive in performing noise reduction.  The DSC-W1 is probably the best and most recent example.  However, the DSC-P150 does not have this problem, and neither does the P200 according to what I've seen and the pictures I've taken. I tried a DSC-W1 for 2 weeks before returning it so I know first hand what the image processor induced blurryness looks like.The second cause of blurryness is a classic case of shaky hands.  The newer generation of Sony Cameras seem to be programed to prefer a longer shutter open time rather than increase ISO or turn on the flash.  It tries to make the most out of available ambient light before making use of adjustments that compromise picture quality.  What this results in are shutter speeds as slow as 1/30th of a second before the camera will start using the flash in full auto mode.  This combined with 7.2MP of resolution will result in blurry pictures if the hand holding the camera isn't absolutely still. In trying to maximize the picture quality of the camera, Sony has traded off some real-world usability.  Whenever I use my P200 to take a picture and see that the shutter speed is 1/40 or slower, I will make a mental note to brace myself when taking the picture, or at least use both hands.All things considered, it's hard to imagine a more perfect combination of everyday usability and performance.  The P200 is perfectly at home snapping birth-day party pictures for 4x6 prints, or mounted on a tripod to get that perfect shot for a 8x10 blow-up.", "Date": "March 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazing Digital Camera, Incredible Value", "Author": "P. Scott Pope \"Scott Pope\"", "ReviewID": "R1GV3524MMVSSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DSC-P200 is an amazing piece of technology that demonstrates how far digital photography has come. With a 7.2 MP resolution, 3X zoom, lithium ion battery and a 2\" LCD screen squeezed into a tiny package, this camera is truly amazing. The output is no less impressive with quality superior to that of any other camera I have seen.One of the advantages of a camera this small is its ability to be carried in your clothing without relying on an external carrying case. While this is a great attribute that allows you to bring it to parties for impromptu photos, its apparent fragility is a cause for concern. It would be nice if Sony provided a glove-like camera case or entirely different, ruggedized housing. Of course, many third-party camera cases are available along with what Sony offers, but even the smallest of these will be too large to fit in a shirt or inside sport coat pocket.In addition to its diminutive size, the camera's portability is also fostered by the lithium ion battery which lasts for nearly two hours. Moreover, with a larger memory chip, you will have everything necessary for a day or more worth of shooting. At the full seven megapixel resolution, photos average about three (3) megabytes each. This means you can store only about ten photos on the included 32 MB Memory Stick, making memory a necessary upgrade. By comparison, my 512 MB Memory Stick allows me to take over 150 maximum resolution 7.2 MP photos. Fortunately, it can be purchased for approximately $55 at Amazon.Even though I am not a professional photographer or artist, I can definitely appreciate the picture quality. I had the opportunity to directly compare the Sony DSC-P200's quality to that of a Minolta 5 MP camera taking the exact same photo at the same distance. The pictures of a friend and me were taken by a waiter in an upscale restaurant with relatively low lighting. At first glance, they appeared to be of comparable quality. After closer inspection, however, it was clear that the Sony image was superior. In one striking example, the shades of my burgundy shirt were more accurate with less pixilation.For the amateur photographer, be aware there are many features to be deciphered. As a former engineer and gadget enthusiast, I consider myself a quick study. Yet, I had to spend a couple of hours reading the manual and still have some learning to do. So, don't buy this camera on the way to your daughter's wedding and expect to use it (besides, the battery will be dead anyway).Many casual photographers may question the need for seven megapixels as this exceeds the resolution of even the largest monitors. For example, a high-end WUXGA (1900 x 1200) wide format monitor only has 2.3 megapixels. However, the camera's superior resolution provides a hidden benefit. Even if you don't want to create large format photos or posters, it does allow for a convenient \"off-line\" zooming. So if you are at sporting event or show, you can take photos of scenes even too far with 3X magnification. When editing the images on your computer, you can crop the part of the photo desired to effectively zoom into the image you wish to save or share with you friends.As a Sony Vaio owner, I have the added benefit of being able to slip the Memory Stick directly into my laptop without having to worry about cables or additional drivers. It would be even nicer, though, if Sony provided some sort of wireless connectivity, such as Bluetooth or WiFi. I can see why Sony would skip this feature as current wireless technology would not be sufficient for transfer of several high-resolution photos.The video capability is a nice frill even though it would not be a key reason for purchasing this camera. I was quite surprised that it produced quality video AND sound recordings. The latter was far crisper than I ever expected. With two gigabyte chips available in 2005, you could record full motion video for nearly 80 minutes. This sounds great, but the camera doesn't record moving scenes very well. Presumably, this is due to internal bandwidth limitations. On this note, it would be nice to provide HDTV video recording, even at a lower frame rate. This would be quite a stretch due to bandwidth limitations/data write speed as HDTV cameras, geared for the professional market, are very expensive.In summary, the Sony DSC-P200 is an incredible piece of technology that provides tremendous picture quality in a small package. I can't imagine wanting more out of a camera other than a ruggedized housing or high resolution HDTV video, which is quite unrealistic given its size and cost.  Given the camera's intended purpose, Sony has done an amazing job. For still photos, the DSC-P200 should be good for a decade or so.Pros7.2 MPIncredible picture qualityLithium Ion batteryCompactConsNo glove-like caseA bit complicated for recreational photographersDelicate (potentially)32 MB of standard memoryNo Bluetooth", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Professional Quality Camera", "Author": "J. B. Quattlebaum", "ReviewID": "R33MX3B0BK5XTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I resisted \"going digital\" for a long time.  When I finally took the plunge and compared cameras, the Sony DSC-P200 was the standout.  Consider this:The P200 has a metal case -- not plastic.The lens is a Carl Zeiss -- the same German optical firm that makes lenses for Hasselblad and Leica.The P200 is made in Japan by the same Sony subsidiary that makes the professional digital Betacams used in Hollywood.The design of this camera deserves an award - the placement of the buttons, shifting of the lens to the extreme left side - the result is a camera that \"feels right\" -- never do I touch the wrong button, or have to search around for the right function.The photos?  I shot Macro, fluorescent, incandescent, cloudy, and bright sunshine -- exposures were excellent and the 7.2 Megapixel Super HAD sensor produced images that did not pixelate until I had enlarged them to 200X!I bought the Sony DSC-P200 (and I recommend getting a 512MB memory stick -- you can get 130 images at the highest quality setting) and the two of us have been inseparable.", "Date": "May 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "After extensive research...", "Author": "Bethany Cerella", "ReviewID": "R2OMWYDH35SGSN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We spent a long time researching the purchase of a new digital camera. My Nikon Coolpix 880 was great when I bought it in 2000, but it's been dropped a few times, and it was a bit heavy/big. I wanted a camera that took great pictures, was light weight and small enough that I could comfortably carry it in my pants pocket.The Sony Cybershot 7.2 has everything I wanted. It's small, easy to carry in a small purse or pocket, and it takes amazing photographs. The image quality is excellent. I do a lot of scrapbooking and crop a lot of pictures before I print them, so it was important to me to have 7.2 megapixels for enlargement.The camera is easy to hold - I have fairly small hands, and it doesn't feel awkward or big.As far as construction goes, the Sony Cybershot 7.2 is user friendly. The battery, memory card and charging outlet are behind the same \"door\". The buttons are aligned so that, for a right-handed person, it's possible to hold the camera and manipulate the image (ie. zoom, change menu options, etc.) with one hand - but do use the wrist strap! The LCD resolution is very good, definitely better than my old Nikon, and I was thrilled to find that the pictures look even sharper on the computer! One major problem with my Nikon was that the on/off button could easily be triggered by putting it in the case, so the camera would stay on and eat the battery up. On my new camera, the on/off button is slightly recessed, so it won't turn on accidentally, and the battery life is exceptional - 300+ minutes. The turn on speed and the time between shots is very quick - about a second. The zoom is excellent as well and gives me a lot of detail.I didn't buy this camera for the video, but I played around with it to see what it was like, and would seriously consider leaving my other video camera at home now! The microphone is located where you would put your thumb if you held the camera with two hands (unless you were paying attention) and sound quality isn't exceptional, but it definitely works well. If you wanted to narrate, I'd suggest speaking close to the camera.Drawbacks: Personally, I need to hold the camera with two hands to keep it steady. This is not a big problem at all, but I thought I'd mention it - unless I'm trying to catch something on the fly, I don't have a problem keeping the camera steady.In scene mode, when you bring up the menu, your setting choices (snow, candlelight, portrait, etc.) are represented only by icons, and I find it difficult to remember what each is.Neither of these problems are (in my opinion) significant, but I thought I'd bring them up in case they are for you.

Jablonski", "ReviewID": "R2LW1IZX7RZ3TE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom and she loves it!  It doesn't say this but if you are wondering if it has a time/date stamp for the photos, it does and you can turn it on/off.  She was very concerned with this because she wanted a time/date stamp.  I took a picture of my fan on FASTEST SPEED and it looked like the fan wasn't even moving in the picture.  This camera is amazing.  It is also soooo fast.  It turns on in like less than a second and it takes pictures fast without delay.  Great quality pictures and good video too.  Also you will NEED to get a bigger memory stick than the one it comes with because it will only hold 9 pictures with the one it comes with.  Also if you are concerned it does not have enough zoom, don't be.  Because of the high MP, you can just crop the picture and it will look like it is zoomed and still be a big picture.  The battery has a very long charge, too!  This is just an all-around great camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Can't ask for more!", "Author": "Scott Berg", "ReviewID": "R8KSKCWQ1J5GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I have owned an arseload of digital cameras--Kodaks, Nikons, and most recently Canons. My last Canon was a G5 and I feel certain I never used more than 5% of the features it had to offer (my bad) and it was just too much camera for me.On top of that, my wife was always complaining about the shutter lag and how it was so annoying when trying to snap pics of kids and other fast-moving objects. That is the first thing about this camera--it is fast. Fast in startup, fast between shots--in that way, it is great. Second, it is small, but not TOO small. I'm a bigger guy and I tried out the somewhat smaller Canon SD500. The longer form factor of the P200 is perfect for my hands. I've never gotten in the way of the viewfinder or flash.Third good thing is the battery life. It lasts a long time and spares are not that expensive. In the miscellaneous category, the LCD is super and it comes with a handy little strap. I'm sure without it, the camera is easily dropped.Not much on the downside--the 32mb card is useless except for trying it out (9 pics??!!). I have always been a CF card man myself, so I had to revamp all my memory, but a 1gb Memory Stick holds more than 200 images. I plan to pick up another.Haven't tried the Movie function or the Redeye, but I hear they are both great. This is just a fantastic camera. Don't imagine I will be getting another for a while, and that is saying a lot for me.", "Date": "March 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera - highly recommended!", "Author": "KE SHEPHARD", "ReviewID": "R1USD5RKWPCXL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited a long time to purchase a digital camera, as I wanted something that would replace my 35mm Olympus, and last me a long time to come.  I'm not a professional photographer, but love taking good quality photos for enjoyment, and so was looking for something that would give me good results without being overly complicated.  I spent several months reading reviews online and visiting various camera shops in my local area.  The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P200 came up trumps every time.I have had this camera since September 2005, and absolutely love it.  It is very easy to use, with a large and very clear screen, and the picture quality is just great.  I tend to download the pictures to my computer as I go, selecting the ones I'd like to have printed and putting them into a separate folder.  Then, when I have about 100 in my folder, I put them onto a CD and take them to the photographic department of my local pharmacy to be printed (price break at 100+ photos).  I really can't tell the difference between pictures taken with this Sony and those taken with my 35mm, the picture quality is so good.The casing is also well-made and robust and the software is very easy to install.  If you have XP, it is not necessary to install the software.As with most digital cameras, it only came with a tiny 32MB memory stick.  However, I purchased a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro and find I can easily store at least 150 photos at maximum 7megapixel resolution, along with several short 1 or 2 minute videos on the standard setting.  The videos certainly use up the space on the chip and drain the battery more quickly, especially on the fine setting.  However, I find the quality of the standard setting videos perfectly adequate.  Also, as I travel a lot between the USA and UK, it's great to be able to play them back on the telly on either PAL or NTSC settings, regardless of how they've been taken.  Indicators can be turned on at the top of the camera screen, to show remaining battery life and chip space.  I recently spent three days at the beach, constantly taking photos and videos, and still had space on the chip and about 100 minutes' battery life when I got home.I have noticed a few little things to be careful of, however, although with a little care and attention, these can easily be overcome:Blurred pictures - I have found the best way to avoid blurred pictures is to hold the camera steady with two hands, press half-way down to focus and then follow all the way through.  A tripod, even a small one, is also handy to have.Dark videos - I find videos are best taken outdoors in natural daylight, or indoors with as much light as possible.Videos deleted from camera in error - When deleting pictures from the camera, be careful not to delete a video in error.  Sometimes, it can look like a blurred picture, or a totally black screen, but that is the first frame of the video.  With the indicators on the camera screen turned on, it will say \"play\" in pale blue on the bottom left for a video, as opposed to \"back/next\" for a photo.Heads cut off printed photos in 6\" x 4\" size - If you open a downloaded photo in Photoshop, taken at 7 megapixels, the image size will show a width of 42.667inches and a height of 32 inches, which is a ratio of 1.333, equal to a size of 6\" x 4.5\".  When you have it printed to 6\" x 4\", however, the ratio changes to 1.5 and a quarter of an inch is chopped indescriminately from the top and bottom of the picture, possibly causing you to lose some of the subject.  If I have a photo in which the subject is close to the top or bottom of the picture, I change the ratio manually in Photoshop, by cropping the height as I want it until it measures 28.45 inches.  I'm not sure if there is a setting in the camera to alter this automatically, but my local Sony store did not know of one and didn't actually know of this problem, although the pharmacy said it had encountered this problem with prints from several different cameras.Flimsy door to charging unit - Charging up is simple and best done overnight (just need plug adaptor if abroad).  However, the door is just a little flimsy and has to be handled carefully.These are just my findings in the 8 months that I have owned this camera, on the few features that I have used.  My boyfriend, who has a greater knowledge of cameras, is also very impressed, and likes the manual features that can be used to override the automatic settings.  One of my friends, who like me, is a point-and-shoot aficionado, liked this camera so much that she bought one for herself, and is really pleased with it.All in all, a great little camera that I am sure I will enjoy using for many years to come.

Buy this camera!", "Author": "xyzzy", "ReviewID": "R2AJ6C451B4ZNN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a vacation trip to Paris in April.  I got back to the States and downloaded the pictures from the camera.  What did I see?  Beautiful picture of the Eiffel Tower with a large, blurry black spot in the sky.  About 30% of my photos had the same problem.  The black blur was often in the same area on most pictures, but because the lens moves when I zoom, the spot sometimes is closer to the center, sometimes further to edge.Upon further examination, I noticed that this black blur is also visible on the LCD preview display on the back of the camera.  (No need to download the pictures to see the problem.)I sent the camera in to Sony for repair, under warranty.  One *month* later, I got the camera back.  The original black spot was gone, *but* a new smaller spot had been introduced during repair.  I sent the camera back to Sony a second time.  After *another* month had passed, I finally got it back.  This time, everything was fine.But guess what?  After another month of using the camera, another black spot was again visible.  What's the deal?  I called Sony to get the answer, but they weren't offering any explanation.  What's my personal opinion?  I think that dust or lint particles are making there way too easily inside of the camera body and lodging themselves onto the inner lens and/or CCD array.Once I realized this, I then started examining other people's Dony DSCP-200 (this model) and DSC-P150 (predecessor model) cameras.  Guess what?  Many had the same problem too!  In some cases, it was a blurry round spot, while in others, it was a squiggly line.  Most people just hadn't known what to make of the problem, so they ignored it.So, do you want to see it too?  Here are the conditions you are *most* likely to see it.1.  First off, let me point out that this problem is *NOT* likely to be noticed by observing the camera indoors.2.  To fully observe the effect of this black spot phenomemon, you must be outdoors during daytime hours, where there is plenty of available light.  For best viewing, the camera should be pointed toward a bright, blue sky.3.  Before performing the following tests, minimize the amount of information shown on the LCD display.  For example, turn off the histogram.4.  The degree to which you can see the problem is determined by (a) the amount of telephoto zoom applied, and (b) the megapixel setting.  The size of the black spot generally changes at various megapixel resolutions.  Therefore, zoom the camera *completely* from Wide to Telephoto under *every* megapixel setting (7M, 5M, 3M, 1M, VGA).  On my camera, it is most prominent when the zoom is pushed to maximum telephoto, but your results will vary.If you don't see the problem, congratulations.  Perhaps you're either lucky, or you haven't used your camera much, or Sony has modified their manufacturing process to eliminate the problem.If you're considering purchase of this camera, then be aware of the potential for this problem to occur, and be prepared to return the camera within 30 days, if you don't like the results.Aside from this annoying problem, the camera produced amazing pictures.  The color it captures is brilliant.  As others have pointed out, the camera produces blurry pictures in low-light conditions, but that's expected given the small size of the camera.  I use a small portable tripod to assist me in those conditions.  The main reason why I love this camera?  The manual mode allows me to capture night shots using the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings that I am accustomed to on a manual SLR camera.  But the Sony DSC-P200 is a tiny fraction of an SLR's size.  I can keep this camera in my pocket anywhere I go.  If it were not for the black spot problem, I'd give it 5 stars.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "SMALL & LIGHT BUT BIG ON FEATURES", "Author": "BEACH BUM \"DACHSHUND LOVER\"", "ReviewID": "R34HJ80KB07L67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS is MY 2nd DIGITAL CAMERA AFTER OWNING a 3.2 MEGAPIXEL KODAK for TWO YEARS.

This was my 7th Sony Camera purchase since 1998.Intially this camera met my every expectation and then some, controls and functions were easy to locate and master, especially having used Sony cameras for so long. The small overall size, easy handling, large LCD screen and great battery life had me in heaven right away.Regular shots were awesome although a few regular shots turned out unexplicably blurry (that happens now and again with every camera for many reasons... not a bnig deal I thought). Then I began using the zoom (both the Precision and Smart zoom) at different resolutions and different magnifications. I consistently found that 75% of my shots were blurry to some degree or another, a phenomenon that I have never come close to experiencing to this extent in the 8 years I've been using digital cameras.I figured I was doing something terribly wrong to produce such a continuously large proportion of blurry pictures.The funny thing is that when you snap the picture the LCD briefly shows the captured image, and it looks great... it's when the pictures are downloaded and reviewed on a computer that the final product is revealed... and most pictures taken using the zoom were terribly blurred.I searched the manual for help and guidance to no avail, and then went to the internet seeking a remedy or explanation, figuring that Using just the keywords of \"DSC-P200\", \"blurry\" and \"zoom\", I uncovered enough commentary and complaining to determine very clearly in mind that this camera is seriously flawed, and that I did not have a lemon. There is even one person who has a web site set up to describe and show examples of the blur problem with the DSC-P200 at: [...]\\\\[...]I consider the zoom on this camera useless. The Sony personnel who had any hands in releasing this camera to the mass market should all be looking for new jobs.Other tibits: The camera took great large video (640 x 480 pixels). The problem is that camera comes with a plain old 32 MB first generation Memory Stick. You need to have a newer Memory Stick called \"Memory Stick Pro\" which has faster read/write capabilities to shoot a video clip with the DSC-P200. So don't plan on even testing the video capabilities with what's supplied in the box. Very cheesy of Sony to do this.Someone on the Internet also mentioned how the box it comes in is most difficult to get back together once it is opened. (Hmmm... to make returning it more difficult????). They were correct and I agree, so if you get one of these pay attention to how you got it out of the box!I was unhappy with this experience, and may be jumping ship with deep regret to another make of camera.", "Date": "August 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "You will fall in love with this camera", "Author": "Ganesh Kumar Eswaran \"Ganesh Kumar Eswaran\"", "ReviewID": "R33BAT8ESDBQUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-P200 is the most recent in Sony's highly popular line of subcompact \"P-series\" digital cameras.Positive Factors:+ High-resolution 7.2 megapixel CCD, a 3x optical zoom lens, and an expanded range of nine preset Scene modes to choose from+ The P200 is a capable, yet very compact, digital camera.

An extra battery is expensive- Flash with its default setting (lower setting) gives underexposed photos.  You can change it to a higher setting but that makes the photos overexposed.  Solution:  Keep it at a higer setting and don't be too close to your subjectOther Notes (if you have time to read):Beginning through intermediate users will be right at home with the Sony DSC-P200, and advanced users will enjoy its excellent portability and manual exposure control option. Although the P200 is technically a point-and-shoot digital camera, it has a lot of creative options and enough image adjustments to handle a wide variety of shooting situations. So, while it's designed to reduce the amount of complicated exposure decisions, advanced amateurs and business users will appreciate it for its quality, portability, and varied shooting options. It has a great feel, looks smart, works fast, and takes great pictures. The Sony DSC-P200 would make a great \"family\" camera, where users with a range of skill levels need to share the same camera. It would also make a great \"pocket camera\" for more experienced users.Despite its small size, the Sony DSC-P200's elongated shape provides plenty of room to extend two average-size fingers comfortably across the front and top of the camera, without blocking the lens or any camera controls. By making the camera thin but long, Sony kept the P200 very compact, yet avoided the lack of finger space that plagues many ultra-small digital cameras. The 3x, 7.9-23.7mm zoom lens (equivalent to a 38-114mm zoom on a 35mm camera), dominates the right side of the front of panel, with a small and very bright orange lamp just above and to the right of it, to help with focusing in low-light conditions. (This lamp also blinks when the self-timer is in use, to let you know when the camera is about to snap the picture.) A slightly larger window for the optical viewfinder comes next, followed by the built-in electronic flash. There is no finger grip on the front, however, I found that the camera felt fairly secure in my hand, with my thumb on the back, my index finger on top, and my middle finger wrapped around the front of the body.Color: Very good color, accurate hue, appropriate saturation. Manual white balance handles incandescent lighting very well. The Sony DSC-P200's overall color was good to very good throughout my testing, with only slight warm color casts from its white balance setting. Its color looks very similar to that of the P150 model that it replaces (no surprise), although its skin tones were slightly more orange-looking. It did handle the always-difficult blue flowers of my \"Sunlit\" Portrait test pretty well though. Indoors, its Incandescent white balance setting handled household incandescent lighting pretty well, but the Manual white balance option produced a really excellent shot. All in all, very good color.Exposure: Very good exposure accuracy. The Sony P200's exposure system handled my test lighting quite well, accurately exposing most shots. It underexposed the very high-key \"sunlit\" portrait shot slightly at the default setting, but a relatively small amount of positive exposure compensation (+0.7 EV) brightened the midtones appropriately. Its default tone curve is rather contrasty (similar to those of most consumer digicams), but its contrast adjustment option helps quite a bit with this. (Even with the low contrast option selected though, the P200 didn't do quite as good a job as the P150 at holding onto highlight detail.) The P200 had no trouble distinguishing the subtle pastel tones on the Q60 target of the Davebox, however, and shadow detail was generally good.Resolution/Sharpness: Very high resolution, 1,550 lines of \"strong detail.\" The Sony DSC-P200 performed well on the \"laboratory\" resolution test chart for its 7.2-megapixel class. It started showing artifacts in the test patterns at resolutions as low as 1,200 lines per picture height, in both directions. I found \"strong detail\" out to at least 1,600 lines horizontally, 1,550 lines vertically. \"Extinction\" of the target patterns didn't occur until close to 2,000 lines.Image Noise: Low image noise, but some loss of subtle detail to achieve the low noise levels. The Sony DSC-P200 generally shows low levels of image noise for its resolution class, but it does trade away some subtle subject detail in order to achieve the low noise levels. (While the loss of detail isn't severe, to my mind the P200 doesn't do as good a job in this respect as did the earlier P150.)Closeups: Very good macro performance, good detail and resolution. The flash has a little trouble though. The P200 performed well in the macro category, capturing a minimum area of 2.39 x 1.80 inches (61 x 46 millimeters). Resolution was very high, and detail was strong in the dollar bill. Detail was also good in the coins and brooch, though both were soft due to the close shooting range. (The softness in the coins and the brooch was caused by the shallow depth of field when shooting this close. This is an optical fact of life, and not the camera's fault.) Details also softened toward the corners of the frame. (Most digital cameras produce images with soft corners when shooting in their Macro modes.) The P200's flash had trouble at such close range, and overexposed the top of the frame, with a reflection on the brooch. (Definitely plan on using external lighting for your closest macro shots with the P200.)Night Shots: Excellent low-light performance. Good color and exposure, with low image noise, at the darkest light levels of my test. Good low-light autofocus performance as well. The P200 did just a superb job on our low light test, producing clear, bright, usable images down to the 1/16 foot-candle (0.67 lux) limit of my test, with good color at the 100, 200, and 400 ISO settings. Color balance turned pink in some shots, likely due to a shorter exposure time. Noise is low in most shots, and even at ISO 400, image noise is lower than I expected, with a nice tight, fine \"grain pattern.\" (The shot at ISO 400 and 1/16 foot-candle really looks better than ISO 400 shots from some cameras in full daylight.) The camera also focused very well in the dark. With the AF illuminator turned off, it could focus down to a light level of roughly 1/8 foot-candle. With the AF assist light turned on, it could focus in total darkness, at least on nearby objects. Overall, one of the better low-light performances from a consumer digicam. Since city street-lighting at night generally corresponds to a light level of about one foot-candle, the P200 should do very well for after-dark photography in typical outdoor settings.Viewfinder Accuracy: A tight optical viewfinder, but accurate LCD monitor. The P200's optical viewfinder was rather tight, showing only 84 percent of the final image area at wide angle, and about 80 percent at telephoto. The LCD monitor actually proved slightly loose, showing just a bit more than what made it into the final frame, though results were near 100 percent accuracy. Given that I like LCD monitors to be as close to 100 percent accuracy as possible, the P200's LCD monitor performed pretty well here, but I'd really like to see a more accurate optical viewfinder.Optical Distortion: Good sharpness in the corners and low chromatic aberration. Geometric distortion on the P200 is about average at the wide-angle end, where I measured approximately 0.8 percent barrel distortion. The telephoto end fared quite a bit better, as I measured only one pixel of barrel distortion (about 0.03 percent). Chromatic aberration is lower than average, as I found about six or seven pixels of fairly faint coloration. (This distortion is visible as a very slight colored fringe around the objects at the edges of the field of view on the resolution target.) The P200's images are also quite sharp from corner to corner, although there's a bit more softening in the left hand corners of the frame than I saw in the earlier P150. (Probably just the result of unit-to-unit variations, the two cameras appear to use the same lens.)Shutter lag and cycle time: Very good shutter lag and cycle time, particularly for a compact model. Like most of Sony's current digicam models, the DSC-P200 is very responsive to the shutter, with full-autofocus lag times that range from 0.30 to 0.55 seconds, and a blazing 0.013 (!) shutter lag in when prefocused by half-pressing and holding the shutter button before the shot itself. Cycle times are also excellent for a 7-megapixel camera, regardless of size, at 1.44 seconds/shot in single shot mode, with no apparent buffer limitation (when writing to a Lexar Memory Stick Pro card), and 1 frame/second for five-shot bursts. Its \"multi-burst\" mode captures 16 small images at a time, at rates as high as 30 frames/second. All in all, a great performer, all the more surprising given its diminutive size. (For those comparing the two models, the DSC-P200 is slightly faster starting up and shutting down than the previous P150, a bit faster from shot to shot, and much faster at downloading images. Shutter lag numbers are virtually identical between the two models.)Battery Life: Really excellent battery life for a compact digicam. Thanks to Sony's InfoLithium battery technology, the P200 showed really excellent battery life compared to other compact digicams (actually, it's very good compared to any size digicam), with 202 minutes projected runtime in capture mode with the LCD on, and 402 minutes in playback mode. As always though, I still recommend purchasing a second battery along with the camera, but with the P200, this is much less of a consideration than it normally is.Print Quality: Excellent print quality, excellent color, good-looking 13x19 prints. ISO 400 images look a little rough at 8x10, excellent at 5x7. Testing hundreds of digital cameras, we've found that you can only tell just so much about a camera's image quality by viewing its images on-screen. Ultimately, there's no substitute for printing a lot of images and examining them closely. For this reason, we now routinely print sample images from the cameras we test on our Canon i9900 studio printer, and on the Canon iP5000 here in the office. (See the Canon i9900 review for details on that model.) In the case of the Sony P200, we found that it had plenty of resolution to make sharp-looking 13x19 prints, even with a little cropping. At the largest sizes, the loss of subtle detail caused by its anti-noise processing was visible in Marti's hair and features, but we suspect that most consumers would find the resulting prints acceptable nonetheless. Subjects with strongly contrasting detail (things like tree branches against the sky) showed no loss of resolution, producing very sharp images even at 13x19. Looking at the high-ISO shots, images from the P200 captured at ISO 400 looked a little rough when printed at 8x10, but we felt that they were acceptable when examined at normal viewing distances. (10-12 inches or so) The ISO 400 image noise was essentially invisible in prints 5x7 and smaller. Color-wise, the P200's images looked absolutely beautiful when printed on the i9900, lush and vibrant, yet very natural-looking.Free Photo LessonsSimple pro lighting and use tips let you snap stunning photos. Check out our free Photo School area!Taken as a package, the Sony DSC-P200 is hard to beat in the subcompact point-and-shoot digital camera market. It packs a 7.2-megapixel CCD, a sharp, high-quality 3x optical zoom lens, nine preset Scene modes and a host of other creative options in to a very small, well-built package. While the DSC-P200 is very similar to its predecessor, the P150, it does offer a few new features, including a larger 2.0-inch LCD monitor, and options for Center-Weighted metering, manual white balance, and spot autofocus. Like the P150, the DSC-P200 is a very responsive camera, with excellent shutter lag and shot to shot cycle time numbers, excellent battery life, and surprisingly good low-light capability. Its color is also bright and vibrant, but natural-looking. On the downside, it does trade away a bit more subtle subject detail than did the P150 to achieve its low noise levels. The detail loss is fairly apparent when viewed onscreen at 1:1 pixel size, but high-quality inkjet prints made from the cameras images don't show the softness nearly as much, and our evaluation is that the vast majority of consumers will have no complaints whatever with its image quality.

It would be infinitely more useful if this allowed you to connect to the camera and take self portraits from afar, but for some odd reason this did not apparently occur to the Sony engineers.By snapping away and taking dozens of easy pictures of scenes from differnt angles, I have been able to capture amazing shots where everyboy's eyes are open and they are actually doing things rather than painfully posed.  It is not clear if the huge 7Mpixel size really is any better than 3 or 5.All in all, it is an astouding value for a picture that fits in your pocket.  Just don't drop it!

I bought the Sony Cybershot after realizing that I needed to have a camera half the size of my \"old-school\" Minolta Maxxum 7 if I wanted to capture half of what I missed in not having the high quality big heavy thing stashed in my little chesire cat purse.The picture quality of this Sony Cybershot is superb, especially for the size.  Being able to record videos with the memory card pro is definitely a very cool at-your-service switch-it-up feature.Sure, I have my own sqaubbles w/ the sometimes failing picture quality of digital, which is a very small percent of blurrier images, usually resulting from movement on the part of the photographer, or a combination of subject or photographer movement and low light. But you hardly have to retreat to delete... MOST of the time images are captured perfectly at an image quality a photographer of any media can be proud of.You must remember that I \"went digital\" not in an attempt for what I consider the true art of photography, but to merely always have a little camera with me that can somewhat live up to my standards of photographic quality while my big camera is away.  This little Sony definitely has not failed and I am very happy with it.This camera takes awesomely to the dark capturing low light images in a highly visible nature. It is easy to use too, and the range is great; you can easily take videos or still photos of you and your friends with your very own normal-length arm.;)Overall, I would highly recommend this camera. It is the perfect sidekick to the person who feels somewhat helpless and stranded without her camera, yet feels that most portables are still like not having a camera with her at all (the lonnnng battery life is GREAT).  The Sony Cybershot pixel quality has enough to suppress these anxieties, and will be the high wire act in digital photography for quite a while, hence, mollifying finicky photographers like me, yet not putting me out on the street with it's cost.8-)I've truly not been disappointed with this purchase.:P", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for Everything", "Author": "T.

My old camera took consistently good photos, but I like to do alot of cropping, and I thought upgrading to 7.2mp would give me greater ability in that area. Also, I wanted a smaller camera.I must say that I've taken about 200 photos with my new Sony, and I'm not overly impressed. I tend to shoot almost all my shots in full auto mode, and at least half of the photos were blurry, or the color was not accurate. I took thousands of photos with my old Olympus, and I would say maybe 10-15% didn't turn out good. With the Sony its 50%. That's not right! Some might say that I'm doing something wrong, but I'm simply comparing full auto mode of my old Olympus to full auto mode of the Sony.Its possible I got a bum camera. With all the glowing reviews that I have seen on this camera, I tend to think that is a possibility. I'm going to send it back to Sony and get a new one, and see if its any better. If not, then I'm going to return it. Unfortunately I bought it online and they don't take returns, but fortunately AMEX has a return policy and they'll take it back.**Update 3-12-05**I am probably one of the few people that now can say they have owned the new Sony P-200 and the new Canon SD-500. As noted above, I was not pleased with the picture quality of the Sony. I went out and got the Canon today. WOW! Big difference! I've taken about 100 shots with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. Sharper pictures. More detail. More natural color.Perhaps I have a defective Sony camera, but I have seen some other reviews where people had problems with blurry pictures, and it seems to be a known problem with the camera. After playing around with the Canon, I don't even want to take the chance of returning the Sony and getting a replacement.

I wouldn't mind something that's even a bit more pocketable than the P200 as well.But what I'm finding is that nothing out there provides these improvements while still also providing the range of features that the P200 does, as a great example of camera that can satisfy a range of skills from beginner to intermediate.Are fewer point-and-shoots supporting manual settings these days, or is it just me?  Where's custom white balance, manual aperture/shutter settings, etc. alongside image stabilization?At 7.2 megapixels, the P200 doesn't give me much reason to upgrade on MP alone.  And after testing image stabilization on a few point-and-shoots, I'm finding that the noise this often introduces in the shot isn't an acceptable tradeoff for a more stable image, in my mind.

I researched all available reviews and decided it was worth the expense to get a good camera with upgrade potential. We have not been dissapointed.The camera is so feature-rich that it was a bit overwhelming for a teen, and we probably have only used a fraction of this camera's features so far. At first the kids (then 12 & 14) did have some trouble getting clear pictures, but have learned to hold the camera a little stiller. This was a very short-lived problem for one of them, the other tends to be less patient and still has occasional problems. Both have other cameras, but overall are photography novices.We just came back from a big vacation in Oregon and both kids took hundreds of photos each (of course we upgraded to the 1 gig card). One took more than 500 photos, the other more than 700 photos plus numerous short videos. There were no space issues with the cards. The uploaded pictures and the prints are the most beautiful results we have ever had in our history of picture taking. You know when you come home from a trip and are dissapointed that your pictures didn't capture the beauty of a place as you remember it? Well this is the first time that that has not happened--in fact, the greens were so deep, the color so saturated, that some of the places seemed even more beautiful than I remembered them!Here's what my friend said of the trip pictures (she's quite a perfectionist and takes better photos than I):\"Wow!!!!!!!!  Your photos take my breath away!!!!!!!!!  I've already watched the slide show twice, but want to watch it again before I comment on the pictures that really grabbed me.  There were a ton of them!  Surprisingly enough, DSC01336 may be my favorite.  It is picture 47 in your 3rd Installment -- on Mt. St. Helens, with brown grasses, old stumps, and small, new-growth trees.  I'm still trying to figure why I like it best, since it has such stiff competition -- the waterfalls, the roses, the tide pools -- wow!, the ocean view, The Columbia River Gorge (one of my dream vacations), etc.  Maybe it'll get knocked out of first place during my third viewing.\"As you can see, I'm not the only one in awe of what this camera can do. The shots of urban art and architecture were crisp and impressive. Even fine architectural features taken on full zoom had fine, crisp detail. The camera seemed to stop the action of the waterfalls in amazing detail in spite of great distance from the scene. The patterns of water droplets stopped in midair were amazing. Water flowing in streams seemed velvety, capturing a detail of texture I haven't seen before. We watched every second of a beautiful sunset on the coast. My daughter wasn't taking photos and I asked her why. She said they weren't turning out, based on looking at what she was capturing on the screen. The sunset was so amazing I used her camera and took the photos anyways. When we uploaded them they were breathtaking. I guess the screen just couldn't display what the lens captured. We photographed tide pools, looking down thru the water at the aquatic life below. I was sure this would be mediocre. It wasn't. The detail of sea life and color was as good as with the human eye. The kids also captured dozens of roses close up and with great clarity, even though they couldn't find the macro feature of the camera at the time. Water droplets on the flowers were amazingly clear.The only photos I consider average were the mountain shots on very cloudy, hazy days. Both Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Hood had overcast, rainy, or foggy weather, and the photos appear more like those you would expect of an instamatic camera. Perhaps this is because the camera can't focus as well under those conditions. We also had trouble in Timberline Lodge, not getting enough light in some of the photos. However, only the automatic setting was used so this could probably be corrected.Overall, I cannot rate this camera highly enough, and agree with previous reviewers on more technical aspects such as great battery life, etc. Accessories we purchased include:\"Sony LCSPHC Soft Carrying Case for DSCP100/P150/P200 Digital Cameras(Textile)\"\"Sony 1 GB Memory Stick Pro ( MSX1GS )\"I HIGHLY recommend this case. I read all the reviewers of different cases that \"fit\" this camera and decided this one is best. When we got it, it fit like a glove. It's perfectly padded, compact, has a nice front pocket for extra cards or ID. The case has a very solid hook on the back so you can clip it to a jean loop so that when you take out the camera you can't loose the case, plus your hands are free to take the picture.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony  DSC-P200 Cyber-Shot Camera", "Author": "old hickory", "ReviewID": "RATT4WMABK3U5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleas4ed with this camera.

The camera is lightweight and attractive - a great camera to take along with you everywhere you go- the body is metal, however be forewarned - the one time that you drop your camera (as I did - in dry sand on the beach) could be one time too many, especially if you are out of the warranty period. The lens began to malfunction immediately and would not extend or retract.  I could view the photos that I had taken prior to the fatal fall, but otherwise the lens cover would not open.  Fortunately the camera was in the last few months of the one year Sony warranty, so I was able to contact Sony and get it repaired - it came back within two weeks, and appears to be repaired, though I haven't had a chance to try it out yet;4) Battery Life and Proprietary Battery - In the meantime, I purchased another identical model anticipating that the wait time would be long and right away there was one fussy feature with the new camera - it would only accept proprietary  Sony batteries, not the non-proprietary batteries that I was able to purchase for $10 each and use with no problem with my first camera;  battery life is not a major concern, however - this camera can go about 200 minutes of average use on the same battery;4) Using the Movie Mode - The zoom feature is useless for video - don't even think about using it because most likely you will end up with grainy, low quality video - also if using the video feature don't turn the camera vertically (keep it horizontal) because as far as I can see, there's no way to turn your movie around when viewing it on the computer - otherwise the microphone works very well, and the sound quality is good - you get about 20 minutes of video on a 512mb memory card;5)Indoor Flash - you may find as I did that the flash is great for closeup images, but does not capture any of the background, so you may have very bright subjects in a dark, indistinct background;6)Using No Flash or Night Setting - here you have a chance to experiment with other effects, and sometimes you'll be successful at capturing a relatively clear, non-blurry image, but oftentimes you won't if you are holding the camera rather than using a tripod;One thing that I want to add is that I also tried out the predecessor to this (DSC-P150?). I purchased a return at a local department store.  I returned it because a brown, blurry spot was showing up in almost all of my photos, a complaint that has been voiced by many about this camera as well.I am happy to have my original camera back and be within the 30 days for return of the second camera, however if I were in the market for a new camera, I might shop for a different Sony model or for another brand, realizing that there may be a better option out there - Still I am looking forward to experimenting with many of the automatic and manual features that I have not yet tried!

This model is a real 'hit or miss' when shooting indoors unfortunately. Even in fairly good lighting conditions and/or with a variety of settings.And like David Gudas's previous review well stated - this camera does indeed have a FATAL FLAW which I learned of very  well while using it at an indoor event recently - Use the zoom in anything even remotely less than that previously mentioned 'optimum lighting'  and you will have both fuzzy and very dark photos - as the flash will go completley out of synch with any use of the zoom.

At first, I wondered if this was a good choice because of the high price which I could not afford on here, but after doing some local research, I found a great price for this camera and bought it and used it the same day. My first experience, shooting in full light indoors, was great. The zoom worked great and even in an auditorium where there was less light, this camera did everything I needed. The zoom is great and keeps everything at a good resolution and doesn't get it blurry, which I found to be a problem in other cameras. It also has an amazing 7.2 MP which makes it even worth a very high price. I can't find another compact camera this size with such good resolution. Outside it also takes great pics. I was consistently impressed at it's ability to take shots that were not blurry, in a fast moving car. It's shutter speed is very high and you can change that in the Manual Mode, which comes in handy. Also, even shooting in the pitch black with no flash, it's able to take a good enough shot that when you go into a photo editing software, you can get a pretty good picture, or you could use the flash.Overall, I'm very impressed with what Sony has done and it doesn't matter that this is an \"older\" camera, when it comes to new technology. Sony is top mark in its category and I'm consistently impressed with what they come out with. I still  need to find a Sony product that doesn't work at top notch performance.

This is a quality little point and shoot that has held up over time. It is fairly intuitive, responsive and easy to use, and the lens/sensor combination created detailed images. Looking at photos from this camera, you wonder why anyone would need more than 7.2 MP of resolution in a compact camera.But the main thrust of my review is to extol the virtues as an infrared camera. For those not familiar with them, infrared cameras capture light in a range a bit higher than the usual visible spectrum. Foliage and other vegetation takes on a white, wintery cast, and skies and water become darker and more dramatic. You can use some cameras to take IR photos just by adding a filter over the lens, but this normally entails the use of a tripod and longer than normal exposure times. The solution to this is to modify you camera by removing the \"hot mirror\" that blocks our much of the infrared spectrum. All you need do then is add an IR filter, either directly over the sensor or on some sort of extender. P200s make great IR camera because they are fairly easy to modify. Don't do it yourself if you don't have the proper tools or know-how. At the current asking price, it is a minimal investment to obtain a quality small format camera that takes such unique photos.  They require some post work in a photo editing program, but even raw photos are striking. I will post some in the customer images section to give you an idea of what you can expect.The bottom line -- a P200 is a great P&S; and 7.2 MP is more than enough for most people. Don't get caught up in the megapixel wars. Having more MPs just lowers the quality of the image while increasing it's size. If you are looking for a camera to modify for infrared use, then the P200 should be at the top of your list if you want one that is ultra-portable.

When I bought it it was highly recommended by dpreview for its high quality lens and fast start up time.  Over the years it had got some dust inside somehow (driving sand on a Welsh beach perhaps?) and had dark spots on every photo - some more obvious than others.  Time for a new camera.  Started shopping.  Eventually settled on a Canon SD990 - ticked all the boxes - optical viewfinder, good zoom range, some manual control.  But the problem started with the pictures it took.  I don't mind out of focus pictures if it's my fault but I did mind the Canon pictures where their processor had oversharpened them to the point of losing all the fine detail in hair, fur, leaves etc.  If it had texture the Canon would blur it.  This gave my photos a rather surreal effect.  The blurry subjects appeared to be wearing crisp clothing in front of a crisp background but their faces and hair had a soft quality about them (and I wasn't even using the Soft Skin mode).  The other annoying thing was the way the Auto mode defaulted back to standard settings every time the camera was switched off.  In an art gallery I had to reset the flash to off every time.  Of course I could have used the Program mode but from my years of experience with the Sony I found that I wanted Program set to spot focus, spot meter and reduced flash.  That way any tricky focussing situation (small subject in front of background - camera wants to focus on background) could be sorted with one turn of the top dial.One of the other annoying things was that it's 'clever' focus wasn't that clever.  It chose inanimate objects over faces in Face Detect mode for example.  After many lengthy conversations with Canon it got returned.  (I suppose I should say at this point that the video I shot with the Canon was fantastic - you can even zoom while recording which is very unusual for a compact and certainly not available on the P200.)Back to the P200.  A few of weeks ago I sent it to Sony for a flat rate $131 refurbishment/repair.  It was back in about 3 weeks.  The service far exceeded my expectations - as well as getting rid of the spots on pictures problem they gave me a new LCD screen.  The old one was fine other than cosmetic scratches but now I have a brand new LCD complete with plastic cover.So I wanted to encourage anyone thinking of buying 'used' that they can get a fantastic service from Sony to fix any minor problems they might have with the 'new' camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pictures.

I've put off this review for a very long time because of that but I think it deserves it, so here goes: This camera and I have been virtually inseparable ever since I got it as a gift in 2004. During these eight years (and counting), I've seen people around me cycle through their digital cameras every two years or so. When I got it, 7.2 megapixels was quite a lot. Eventually, that was no longer a big deal and people around me began to pop up with cameras with more megapixels. Still, I have yet to find a camera that takes pictures of comparable quality to mine. I also have the experience, on the sad day that I don't have my camera on me and have to use someone else's digital camera, that I feel like I'm struggling to get a good picture with their camera--it's a frequent experience with digital cameras to get images that are too grainy, too dark, too yellow. But, with this one, the colors are transmitted perfectly, the focus is a cinch, and I find 7.2 megapixels to be more than sufficient (an embarrassment of riches for me). The menu is intuitive and easy to use too, so that if you're in a dark setting you know exactly what to do; I've taken many professional-looking photos on the night setting. All of this aside, most importantly: I can vouch for the reliability and sturdiness of the design: I've had this camera for *EIGHT* years now and it's still working great. It's been dropped, mishandled, groped with greasy hands (I keep a food blog), kept out in the dust without its case but it's like the first time every time. That's the main thing that motivated me to write this review--I don't know anyone whose digital camera has lasted that long. Usually, my friends will replace theirs approximately every two to three years max. My family cycles through them nearly every year; the first Canon they got broke in a year's time. They've had a Panasonic for a few months now but the images come out with a suboptimal color balance, not very true-to-life. Meanwhile, I have not experienced a *single* problem or malfunction of any sort with my camera.

My husband and I own many cameras.  We have 2 big Canon Dslrs, a Canon point-and-shoot, and a Canon G-11.  I also have a full frame Nikon DSLR, and a Sony Alpha DSLR.....but this review is about the Sony DSC-200 Cybereshot 7.2 mp.  First, with the Carl Zeiss glass in this camera the optics are amazing in such a tiny little camera.  The color saturation set on normal just blows me away.  I have taken some of my truly truly favorite shots of all time with this camera.But the true test is this camera's durability.  It has hiked the Appalachian Trail...riding along in a zip-lock bag....that's a 2,000 mile trail...6 months of steady camping in all weather conditions.  it's been to the Outer Banks, where it had sand all in the pop-out lens mechanism...all over Europe and Central America...It's been dropped a thousand times....and it survived my teen-agers purse!  That last one was the worst!  It is dented, scratched, and the body gaps a teeny bit at the top....but it STILL KEEPS MAKING GREAT PICTURES...I thought maybe I should replace it for a less worn copy.  So, I went online and read about it.  the reviews for this particular model were tremendous.  I tried to find one on eBay, but they were selling for more than the original price...apparently the secret was out.  So I looked for a newer model.  But the reviews on these were milk-warm.  and then I thought...so what if it's dented, and scratched?!...We won those war wounds together on some of the most amazing trips.  I'm gonna send it in to Sony,  just for a once-over, not because it needs it, but because it deserves it.  The movie resolution is incredible, you will not be disappointed.All I can say is, if you can find one, buy it!  Don't be a victim of the megapixel wars, unless you're making posters..it just won't matter.  I have had absolutely no problems with blur, and all I can say to those people is that it's either technique, or you got a lemon....but the vast majority of us have gotten golden apples with this camera as evidenced by its stellar reviews and the price INCREASE of this camera as they become in short supply.For you dog lovers, here is an analogy:  I have a Golden Retriever, and a Shitzhu.  the Golden is 80 pounds of muscle and super sweet.  As a puppy, the Shitzhu was raised by the Golden, so no one has ever told him that he was just  little dog.  He has no little dog bad habits, like barking, or being over stimulated.  In fact, he retrieves, and swims in the ocean just like the big dogs...The point is, my DSLRs are terrific and they take great pictures, but nobody told my little Sony that it can't take great pictures like the big cameras....so it just takes great pictures!  I can put my Shitzhu in my basket on my beach cruiser bicycle, and I can put my Sony in my hip pocket.

I, and others like me were wrong, the dust is internal because there are no seals around the lens housing.Their design is so bad, the dust particles INSIDE the camera have taken over about 50% of the image area. The exact area floats about from day to day. I tried having it repaired by Sony and they said it would cost, with shipping charges almost $150.00 (18 months ago). The problem is they didn't recognize the FACT that the camera was designed and built without any seals, therefore what they were charging me for, was cleaning the inside which they would guarantee for 90 days. Meaning the problem would certainly return, since it would still lack lens seals.I've checked with camera dealers who were not aware of this problem with other major camera brands.In my opinion, Sony should have offered owners of the DSC-P200 a free upgrade or recognized the flaw in an otherwise good camera, and have it corrected at no charge.Obviously I won't buy another Sony camera, but unless you find out they fixed this specific problem, or you don't mind the dust balls in your photos, you should look to one of the other major brands.

I have used it when I go traveling, partying, and hiking. I have used and abused this camera since I got it and it still works.What I like about this camera is it is handy. It can take video clips. It takes amazing rich color photos and performs well on low light conditions. I think carl zeiss lens has something to do with this. I rarely run out of battery juice. Battery charging time is only an hour or two. I went caving and I got this camera wet. My fellow caver and I were surprised it survived.  Turning the camera on/off is fast that it is unlikely you'll miss a shot. The shutter speed is decent that the timing of taking moving subjects is not hard to get.What I don't like about this camera is the timing of the flash. The flash goes off before the shot. As a result, the picture is taken like as if there was no flash. (No, it was not on a flash delay mode). It takes really great pictures but because of this problem 1 out of 5 attempts comes out right when the flash is needed. It is embarassing to those subjects posing for you. You will lose great shots this way. Like other comments here, the lens curtain doesn't fully shut. But it shuts completely when you play with it. It's been like that even before the caving incindent but I didn't mind it so much because it take great photos. Another thing I don't like about this camera is the discontinued adapters.

We have i-control here and there are several videos that can help you get the most out of your camera.", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "LOST AND FOUND !!!!", "Author": "K.H.L. \"kathylambert99\"", "ReviewID": "R2OYTIG8R82DOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know you are reading this hoping to read a review. I am desperate to find my lost camera and I hoped this would help. I had a Sony cybershot dsc p200. It took great pictures but that is not why I'm writing this. I'm hoping that whoever found it will look at these reviews if trying to resell. In my opinion, this camera will be useless without a way to charge it or upload it to a computer, as buying accessories for a discontinued camera is not easy or cheap!( I know, I had to replace my usb wire last year after my dog chewed it and it cost almost $100 to replace). My memory card is what I really am hoping to recover as my pics are very precious to me. I had over 170 pics of my childrens' last day of school and my daughter's gymnastics recital and as a scrapbooker, losing pics is devasting! So if anyone has my camera please do the right thing and return it to the North Kingstown police. I live in RI and lost it on 6/24/07 at an airshow. Again, the camera is replacable but the photos on the memory card are priceless to me !!! There will be no questions asked! Thank you so much for reading this and if you are at all religious, say a prayer that my pics are recovered.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures when they are not blurry....", "Author": "Walter Ross", "ReviewID": "R28W6E7J6T0BAX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for a while now and am in the process of getting rid of it and getting a new camera. The biggest problem with this camera is its small size. This camera repeatedly takes blurry pictures due to primarily two reasons..Reason 1) When holding the camera it is very easy to get your finger in the way or partially blocking the flash causing it to not flash all the way or flash out of sync so the picture turns out blurry.Reason 2) Even for us young fella's with rock solid hands it's hard to hold this camera still enough to keep it from shaking ever so slightly and causing blurry pictures. Couple that with its small aperature size and you have to be extremely still to get a crystal clear picture.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Watch Out for the Battery/Memory Card Door.", "Author": "Aimathena \"Aimathena <3\"", "ReviewID": "R2LAFKIQH6ZBGS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because...

I love Sony, and usually the name stands for fantastic equipment. Not here.I have found the problem with low light situations to be that the flash will sync at 1/40 of a second. Compare that with the usual flash sync of most cameras at 1/60 of a second. That may not seem like such a differnce, but think about taking 1/40th of one pizza and 1/60th of another. The 60 is more stable and has more pieces remaining.I used my camera at an auto show. The 40 sync causes any motion to blur. I got decent car photos, but the people walking in the background were blurs. I took some other shots with friends goofing around at a restaurant. The slightest hand movements in the shot were blurred.Some reviewers will say you need to hold it with both hands and some other things. I have to reject this. This is a pocket sized camera. You get it to carry around and use for snapshots (for the most part). Most of the stuff you're going to shoot with this is going to be indoors with bad light. The camera doesn't work well in the situation most of us bought it for. You can manually adjust the camera to a shuter speed of 60 or better in those situations, but most users won't understand that.Look at a Canon or something, or wait until I hope Sony gets it right next time.", "Date": "March 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Works great 7 years later!

Sony even bribed Chinese journalists to hush the issue.I've had mine for nearly a year now. I've had to get it fixed twice for dark spots. This is because dirt/dust gets into the camera and onto the CCD. In short, this camera is not airtight. You need to keep it in a sealed pouch at all times. Once the camera came back from being service, it was not even properly cleaned (check comments here for someone to who the same thing happened). So they changed the whole optical unit.Now the camera gives blurry pictures when using the zoom. This is systematic, even if the camera is on a tripod, even if the object photographed is very far and you manually set the focus on infinity.This camera is a piece of junk.
