Wieland \"mama mia\"", "ReviewID": "R3S2H1O7K2PHJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My sister and I love Love LOVE our Envue digital photo frames!!!  Here are a few tips on using this product.1. You have to hold in the power button for a few seconds to turn it on.... I do believe it says that in the manual that  comes with it.2. When clicking on the side arrows, slide show, or the multi picture (bottom) buttons you need to make a short and quick click. This seems to work better than pushing really hard for a long time.3. Last but not least. When trying to push the middle main menu button you need to hold in in for a couple of seconds and then an hour glass will come on the screen to let you know it is going to the main menu.This item was so easy to put pictures on and use that we went back and bought a total of 6. We were able to put family photos on one and take it to my grandma in the hospital. We set it on slide show and she always had her family with her and never felt alone. With the memory card option we were able to have a slide show  almost 1000 pictures long. She loved it!!", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Mel F.

After purchasing enVue it worked the first time after I loaded in photos from computer. Since then the only thing it will do is show 1 photo, I can switch it to controls view after pushing the enter button several times, but can't open any of them. After using the reset, the only way I can shut if off, the same photo comes back up and I wait for slide show after pushing the button, and nothing happens. I actually bought 2 enVues. Afraid to try the other. I was planning to purchase another so I could have one on each level and not have to put photos on wall. Now I will have to rethink this project. This looks like a product where you just take your chances if you are a gambler.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "tom", "ReviewID": "R3VVXUQ4QB1YMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "was looking for something to read my sd cards while deep in the woods....many others costs 100's of dollars more....this little unit can be charged one time and last for over 100's of viewings....i have 8 trail cameras out and do not re charge but once a year", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "My experiance", "Author": "duaine melton \"newbie\"", "ReviewID": "R3H3V71IZE9EXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was given 1 enVue for my birthday with 685 pictures on an sd card. Liked it, so ordered another thru Amazon. I am pleased with them after I finally get them programed. But getting them set up is a nightmare. Very hard to change thru the options and get everything installed. Both are the same. I haven't found the secret to this yet. But still trying.

It solves half of both purposes, It is a bit too bulky for hand held and Has very small screen for Desktop. The area for the buttons is rather big than what you will expect (I wish they would have made the screen size a bit bigger in comparision to the total size). The Picture quality is good. It accepts ONLY SD (No HDSC) and MMC. You can scroll through or choose slide-show or see in Thumbnail view which is good.  The Travel charger (Which connects with the USB to power from A/C Outlet), The Auto Play software and the designer case are added advantage. Overall go for it if you find a really good deal. Not fit for this price.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "J.

I made sure it was fully charged and it turned on once and seemed fine, well that was the one and only time I got it to work.  Now it won't turn on with the power button at all, it won't load or read any pics from the card, when I hit the reset button it does power up and show the getting started slides but that's it- that's all I get.  Total waste of my money and I definitely don't recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "We're In A Recession...", "Author": "F. D.

Some prize.  After charging the viewer, the only function the center button would open was \"Calendar.\"  We could not open the other functions, no matter how long or how hard we pressed the center button.  I inserted an SD card with 10 photos on it, but the enVue insisted that there were no photos on the card.  I then plugged the EnVue into my computer.  The computer recognized the new device, but then locked up completely.  I tried it again with the same result.  Some people may have had good luck with this device, but not us.  I definitely do not recommend buying this product.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "it's more then I ask for or expected...", "Author": "Holly Thompson \"hippy holly\"", "ReviewID": "R1FP6UMXNSGDQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My hubby bought this for me last Christmas.

Hill \"CFH\"", "ReviewID": "R1VNZR95F1L3S9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The enVue Digital Photo Album is a fairly nice portable viewer that performs better than expected. For the price (this can often be found on sale) it is a good value. Here are my observations:Pros -* Display: Very clear 3.5\" LCD Screen, pictures are shown in proper aspect ratio and are surprisingly crisp.* Functionality: The Slideshow feature works well and navigation through the individual pictures is easy using the \"rose\" interface.* SD/MMC Support: This was important for me since we have a bunch of 1gb cards laying around and it is nice to be able to have a card for different subjects like family pictures, vacation pictures, business pictures (we have a candle shop), etc. NOTE: No card is included, if you want to use this option you must provide your own (but they are fairly inexpensive now, see Fujifilm 1GB SD Memory Card).* Internal  Memory: If you don't want to use a SD or MMC card, you can transfer photos to the internal memory using the software that auto-loads from the enVue when you connect it to the PC (no CD load needed). This is a very basic program but works well enough.* Rechargeable Battery:  The internal rechargeable battery is long lasting (but have not confirmed the 6 hour claim) and recharges either directly from the USB cable when it is attached to the PC or to the included AC adapter. This is a very nice feature.* Table Top Stand: The unit includes a detachable stand that can be easily put on or removed as needed.* Case:  Includes a \"pleather\" case that looks very nice and will provide a bit of protection.Cons -* Display: Pictures in Portrait format are somewhat hard to see, Landscape format works best. Also, like many LCD displays, pictures must viewed straight on as they lose clarity when viewed form an angle.* Menu: Changing Settings in the internal menu is not as intuitive as it could be.*System: My unit was acting \"flaky\" when first powered on, with some options working and others not. Pressing the reset button cleared it up and there haven't been any issues since.Overall, this is a good portable Digital Album with nice features. Recommended, especially if you can find it on sale.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "digital photo viewer", "Author": "Karen Kilgore", "ReviewID": "R26CBAT6LWAYBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This works very well for my husband who likes to view pictures from his game camera.

I love this product and have been waiting for one a long time.

Being that I have wanted a Digital Photo Album, I was excited to receive it but I quickly found that it's nothing more than a piece of junk!  I thought it just wouldn't work because after charging it all night, I couldn't get it to come on by pressing the ON button but it did come on when connected to my PC to transfer pictures.  I decided to press REALLY hard on the ON button and I finally was able to get it turned on.  Then I tried the buttons in the center and again found that one of them doesn't work unless pressed really hard - I mean I have to almost stand on it to get it to work and even that doesn't always mean I can get it to work.  I can't imagine it's that hard to get buttons to work on a piece of electronic equipment like this.Bottom line - my advice would be to stay away from this product.  I'm going to see if I can find the manufaturer's website and see if I can send it in for service or a replacement.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001N1J39O"}}
