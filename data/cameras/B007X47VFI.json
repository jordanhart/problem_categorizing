Cameta Camera has put together the PERFECT kit for this D3200.The camera: GREAT for beginners or advanced users. The menus are super easy to use and the guided menus allow you to let the camera do all the work. It is not heavy and the battery is extremely small compared to other DSLR's. The kit lens is all you need for your basic photography and the extra Tamron lens gives you the ability to test your skills a little bit more.The accessories: I LOVE the book bag. It is small but fits EVERYTHING that comes with the kit. The remote control is something TOTALLY FUN but I haven't used it yet. The SD card is a huge 32GB so you won't run out of room and the lens hoods and uv filters are must haves for any DSLR.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "New Toy for My Photos", "Author": "Cdawes", "ReviewID": "R10HIP96WOU5PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera...
