Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about....at 12mp these pics are as clear as day. I am an ebay seller and couldn't own this camera if it didn't take clear and sharp pictures. Easy to use. Easy to upload pictures but I still use my HP software for that. Only drawback so far is not being able to use the special rechargeable batteries that last longer than regular rechargeables. Have to use the single and not the rechargeable battery packs.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture quality not as expected", "Author": "mom2three", "ReviewID": "R1EKQ8GAIKJ0U5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have had this camera for about a month and are disappointed with the picture quality. The indoor photos that we have taken have been rather grainy and the color is off. The flash isn't very strong and the pictures come out on the dark side. This is not what we expected from a Kodak camera, and especially a 12 MP camera.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for a cheap camera, does what it needs to.", "Author": "ashley", "ReviewID": "R1DZPGP9N5DK0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this last year on black friday at walmart for $85, I think it was a good price.PLEASE NOTE: ALL digital cameras will EAT batteries, they are a high usage item and you need to buy rechargeable batteries. When I got a Wii the remote went through a pair of batteries in a day or less, researched this and figured out you need rechargeable batteries for high usage items. So i have energizer rechargeables.Pics: I use it for my ebay pictures and it takes clear pics, I don't even use it on the highest setting because the pics would be too big.Memory: the on board is tiny, so i suggest buying a memory card. I bought a 4gb one off ebay for $10, on my medium setting it can take 1000 pictures, haven't check how much video that is.Video: actually haven't used it yet, but my aunt has the same camera and she took video while on vacation, (i seriously have to start using this part) it recorded good for a camera, and even got sound.Zoom: Is ok, but not great, keep in mind this is not a $1000 cameraOne weird thing, it worked fine, but after putting in the memory card it wouldn't turn on, i freaked out, but tried different batteries and it worked again. They were 4 year old rechargeables, so i bought new recharge ones and it's working fine.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best cameras!", "Author": "Betty McQueen", "ReviewID": "RGRI8U50MEDW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

It takes nice, crisp pictures and does a great job with motion shots. I love being able to take photos of the kids & pets running around without the photos turning out blurry.The only con is the battery life. It requires a high level of power, so regular batteries last only a minute. It blasts through rechargeable batteries, too, but they seem to last a bit longer. I purchased Kodak brand rechargeable batteries. The best way to use this camera is to turn it off between groups of pictures. It sucks up the battery too much if you leave the camera on for a minute or 2 between photos.It takes decent videos.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yay kodak", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R1TXOOEGOAB4QV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera over a year ago and i love it. The photo quality is good for the price. I would not call it great but i would not call a lot of hand held digital camera's photo quality great. I am disappointed with the video. I don't like it at all, so i try not to use it. If i have to it will do, but I would rather not use it, it's a better alternative to my phone so thats good! The macro setting doesn't go as close as i want it to, but i didn't expect it to because it doesn't have manual focus. Oh man if it had manual focus it would be fantastic! It has long exposure (up to 8 seconds) so you can play around with light. I made a really cool HDR with the 8,4,2,1,.5, 0.0, and -2.0 exposures and it came out really good. So there's a lot you can do with it. If you just want a little camera to take pictures with, nothing at all professional, it's a great camera. Oh yeah one last thing, definitely get rechargeable batteries!", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for.", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "R1K6NU5ONFA7AC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera on a Black Friday sale at Wal-Mart.The pictures are beautiful on this camera, but I can barely use it.On 12 mp, it will eat new batteries in 2 pictures.On 3 mp, it will eat new batteries in 7 pictures.On 1 mp (the lowest setting), with out a flash I'm able to take 6 pictures.I would like a camera that I could take out and not have to carry a ton of batteries for on vacation.This one is best to leave plugged into your computer for EBay shots.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Point and shoot", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2UEK27FLQUUXJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at work from a co-worker.It is a quintessential point and shoot. No fancy stuff, just a 12 MP point and shoot.That said, the camera is great for a novice or family shooter.It has enough resolution for decent 8 x10s or 11 x 14s.What it is not is a camera for the serious amateur or professional.It serves the needs of my wife well since she does not want to know about the intricacies of photography and just wants a camera for family photos. That said, it is perfect for that job.By the way, I have worked in the past as a pro photographer and I have 'the eye'.I even use it sometime for casual shooting and it works just fine in that roles.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "An Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIOMZ3A3VZE11", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take with me in a 54 day trip to Europe what a piece of junk I think I went through more batteries  then the camera was worth I dropped the camera in my hotel room ONE TIME and it stopped working so I spent about $100 + on a camera that took over $100+ in batteries and that stopped working not even a few weeks into my trip and the customer service office tells me it my problem  Kodak sure isn't what it used to beKodak you have lot a costumer", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Its fine", "Author": "Michelle Lang \"Michelle\"", "ReviewID": "R7Y5PON2M2IOS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have had this camera almost a month.
