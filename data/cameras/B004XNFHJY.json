It's compact and aesthetically pleasing, and ridiculously easy to use. I brought it to a Water Park the first day I had it and it endured submersion after submersion- it even went down a few slides with us too! It's durable (I admit I dropped it already) and the batteries lasted the whole day of picture taking/reviewing without needing to be changed! The pictures come out clear with and without the flash outside, and the clarity of the indoor pictures (with flash) are great! I take a lot of arm's length shots of my family and self and *those* pictures come out perfect outside with no flash, but really washed out if you use the flash indoors (and too dark without it), so that is my only gripe- which isn't that  much of one, seeing as how I have a tripod for use in that circumstance, that I was just too lazy to use that day. I would recommend this camera again and again!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little camera", "Author": "lenahicks", "ReviewID": "R36QBD3TY6FEX5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to use at the beach, and it was well worth the money.

The pictures come out nice. The problem with the camera is the reflection of the preview screen. Underwater and in the sun the pictures can not be seen on the screen. Therefor, it is hard to see if a good picture was taken or not until after you not in the water or not in the sun. The camera also is slow to take one picture to the next. So you have to be as fast a the fastest fish to get the picture. After I previewed the pictures I took at the reef most of them were very nice.

Instead of taking a few rolls of film for a disposable camera, I wanted to get a digital camera that I didn't have to worry about changing film or running out while I was in the water.Battery life - I took about 100 pictures in the water in the span of a few hours and the battery only changed from a full 3 bars to 2/3 bars so the poor battery life suggested by the other reviewers was a non issue for me.Picture quality - The picture quality underwater was awesome and you could see all the fish with really great detail. I only had a couple bad pictures when I took the picture right after turning it on without letting the camera adjust to the brightness of the sun, otherwise everything was great during the day underwater without using any flash. Above water, the pictures turned out pretty good, but not nearly as good as underwater - I usually just use my iphone anyways for pictures so if you complain about this taking bad pictures everywhere else, who cares just use your phone's camera since you'll probably have it on you anyways.Videos - I took a video underwater and it was pretty good quality and also had sound with it tooOverall, definitely worth the $50 since I don't have to develop multiple rolls of film now and can just copy from the microSD card to my computer, plus whenever I want to take underwater pictures I now have a great camera!", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bell+Howell Spash camera", "Author": "Diana", "ReviewID": "R3LZ6MGL1G9ZFK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this Bell & Howell camera for my 4 year old grandson.

The price is right, free shipping from the vendor on Amazon's site and it's a Bell & Howell product; they've been producing cameras forever so you can't go wrong with a trusted name. We purchased a 16 GB micro SD card & adapter from Amazon - this card can hold thousands of pix so we can wait to download our shots until we get home. I also recommend using rechargeable AAA batteries (Duracell's are best) with the camera instead of buying tons of batteries to travel with.
