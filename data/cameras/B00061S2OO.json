Very well-built.  This is a very feature-rich camera and I am still trying various features.  Mostly I have been taking photos (about 1800 already) in both Program mode and Aperture Priority mode and getting to know the camera.I don't really have much problem with the auto focusing. I owned the 5700 before this and several other Nikon digitals.  While the Nikon uses a contrast-based focusing system, this particular camera has a very effective focus assist light that allows good low light focusing, even in a completely dark room.  Focusing in general is very quick, though the camera hunts just a little at full tele. Shutter lag is minimal but this camera is a little slow in writing to card.  The use of Quick Response, though, allows you to take immediate shots if you do not need to refocus (though you can recompose) and there are a variety of continuous modes so this is a minimal problem for me in the type of photography I do, even when taking photos of my husband riding his bicycle (Panning with him in focus and background blurred).  I take most of my indoor photos near wide angle and I choose to turn off the 9-point area focus system. If this is on, the camera has a smaller area to try to focus in.  I tend to use an exposure of a minus 1/3 outdoors and a plus 1/3 indoors.Outdoors the 10X stabilized lens is fun and the VR stabilization technology works very well.Photo quality is very high and there is very low noise at ISO 50.  I do not usually need to use an antinoise program on my photos unless I use the higher ISOs.TTL focusing is possible with the SB600 or SB800 external flashes.  You can use all the features except the focus assist of these flashes, but you already have a good focus assist light on the camera.Negatives?  I find the placement of the function button awkward, but all the other buttons and dials are very well placed.  Also, Nikon is slow in getting accessories available for us.  While the Nikon filters are an odd size, most of us have chosen to use a filter adaptor from nextphoto.com which allows the use of generic filters.  I find the zooming mechanism a little jerky.  And there is a little barrel distortion at wide angle, not a problem in my photos.  CA including PF have really not been a problem for me.I rate this camera very highly!", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Camera", "Author": "Jason M. Zorn", "ReviewID": "R20J1OOAGIHZNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself a typical prosumer photographer (if such a thing exists) -- I have had several digital cameras over the past 3 or 4 years from 1MP, 2MP 3.2MP, 5.1MP and now this 8MP wonder. It produces quality shots with a \"virtual\" SLR viewfinder; unless your stubbornly dogmatic about needing a \"real\" dSLR, this camera is equal to, if not better than, most dSLRs that cost 2-3 times as much. The only place where a dSLR might prove more advantageous would be for the photographer who is looking to take alot of VERY FAST moving action, such as war correspondents and sports journalists. Considering the vast majority of professional photographers do everything else - from wedding/portrait photography, macro photography, wildlife, etc. - this camera equals and exceeds its pricier kin manyfold. I would also remind everyone that the megapixel value is higher on this than on most dSLRs, and the noise is almost non-existent except in severely bad (I mean SEVERELY bad) lighting conditions. Tip: use lumatix and autobracketing, coupled with Photo Ninja on your pics and you will rarely ever have a bad photo (technically, not compositionally) as it pertains to exposure and grain/luminance noise. Final verdict: this one beats out all the other 8MP models and fulfils 90%+ of the professional photographer's needs as well or better than the pricier (and lower MP) 4-6MP dSLR's do (except for very-fast-moving photo work, which is only an issue if your a photojournalist in all likelyhood.)", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot, with a few caveats.", "Author": "R. D. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1F6WFBX41358X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a D70 and bought the 8800 for my wife.  Initially she was very resistant to use the camera because it can be somewhat intimidating what with all that extra text in the viewfinder and the buttons and modes.With time, she warmed up to the camera and now loves it.  The VR stabilized zoom is a critical plus feature with the VR making a noticable difference.The camera takes great pictures in Auto in a variety of situations and it does a pretty amazing job of figuring out what the exposure should be for some pretty hairy conditions.  (Ironically this seems to be even better than my D70, but this is only an impression, not a calibrated fact).  We have not tried to use some of the more advanced features of this camera, but \"Movie Mode\" works well.  I don't know why 640X480 60FPS mode has a 60 second limit though.  (It must have something to do with write buffering, because when you finish a 60 second clip, the camera goes busy for QUITE some time.)  The bottom line is that you can get a lot of great pictures with this camera just leaving it on \"auto\".There are two caveats about this camera that cause me to only give this four stars.  The first is that the camera is slow, particularly to focus.  In fact, this slowness is the real reason it took so long for my wife to get used to it.  By the time you have framed the shot of the kids and the camera goes through the full range of focus, the moment is gone.  By comparison with my D70 in rapid fire mode, I have turned the camera on, zoomed to size and taken a half dozen shots.  (One of those 6 pictures \"worked\" vs. zero with the 8800.)  Once you learn to manage the \"half depression\" for the take button, you can somewhat compensate, but it is not intuitive operation.The second caveat is not so much of an issue as it is something to be aware of.  For some evil reason only known to the cruel marketing folks at Nikon, they made an incompatible (with the D70 that is...) battery pack for this camera.  There is no \"real\" reason Nikon cannot use a common battery pack across several camera models, they just do not.  This is important because this unit goes through a charge at BREATHTAKING speed.  It is entirely possible to be outdoors in a nature environment and need to change the battery over the course of a single day.  If you buy this camera, be *sure* to also buy an additional battery (maybe even two) and if you go on vacation, be sure to remember to bring the charger and charge the battery(ies) fresh each night.  (A simple international plug adapter works fine as this is a broad range international charger.) Contrast this with my D70 which only required a recharge once a week (*and* I took three times more pictures...).  Whereas I wasted my money buying an extra battery for the D70 (a simple charge each day works fine), for the 8800 this extra battery is essential and if you do not buy one or forget to bring it along, I *guarantee* that you will run out of power.Other than these two caveats, it is a great unit.****Well, a third caveat which would cause me to drop the number of stars to two but I cannot as amazon won't let me.  We too have been victims of the Coolpix 8800 \"lens error\".  We sent it in for warranty repair, and they fixed it but sent it back with the page of the manual highlighted about how you are supposed to keep the lens barrel clean.Gee whiz, thanks for the tip, Nikon.P.S. Nikon: the lens barrel *was* clean...We went on vacation after the warranty service and yet again got the maddening lens error.  I discovered, by an act of sheer frustration and desperation, that to work around this you need to mechanically disturb the lens.  One reviewer mentioned that they grabbed the lens.  This strikes me as being a bad idea and you are likely to break something.  What worked for me was to turn the power on, and while the lens was extending, immediately activate the telephoto followed by wide angle, and cycle it back and forth.  This seemed to \"clean\" the already clean lens barrel.Based on the number of comments about this and based on the fact that when we encountered the problem any reasonable person would have concluded that the lens barrel *was* clean, I have to conclude that Nikon's expectation is that this camera was designed to be operated in a \"class 1 clean room\".However in the real world where you carefully protect it from the elements, it might miss-behave.Buyer, beware.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not in love, yet.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"nushie\"", "ReviewID": "R10WC8UKA6R8MI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned every coolpix from the 900 to this one. Every time they come out with a new model, I sell the old, and buy the new. There are always some new feature I'd like to have, items on my wish list that have been answered. (Some of my best shots were taken with the 900 1MP model.) I certainly miss the smaller twist models (last:4500).The good: I'm comparing mostly with the more recent coolpix models, not similar cameras from other manufacturers. I could go into why I've stuck with Nikon, but that's another story. Nikon has wisely taken their most often used controls away from an inconvient buried menu and put in on a dial right net to the shutter release. The have threaded the front lens mount for easier use of lens add-ons. (the 5700 and 8700 require slide on adaptors). the Vibration Reduction was a big upgrading feature for me. Past owned coolpixes: you're taking a shot of people outdoors in shade. The coolpix wants to use the flash. You disable the flash and find that your resultant shots are blurry. Agggrhhh!!! The VR helps in this respect. I've pushed the use of this feature, and its certainly not a miracle worker, but an improvement. The 10X zoom lens is a real winner- keeps away the temptation to use an add-on tele conversion lens. The short movie feature is better in quality than past cameras and very handy. There is a new battery model- needed for the more power hungry 8800. If your coming from a smaller MP camera, the 8MP's value is in allowing you to crop in software and still get a sharp print. Also for making very large enlargments. For regular snapshots and email/web photos it is gross overkill. There is a remote control which is nice for taking slow shutter speed shots and the times when the photographer wants to get in the picture without having to run like the devil before the self timer releases. For those not familiar with the coolpix line, the build is excellent, the camera is comfortable, the close ups breathtaking, the photos are very sharp, the features are numerous. The monitor swivel is very handy- i'd say indespensible. This is a choice if you want the top without getting into interchangable lenses and the expense and inconvenience of same.The bad: The 8800 is a tad larger than the 8700, but just enough to make it feel bulky. The 8700 felt perfect. The shutter delay is still annoying. The low light functionality is still inferior. The manual mode is still relatively useless. (It would be great to be able to focus and zoom the lens by turning the lens barrel like you could in prehistoric times. The monitor is a tad small for a camera of this size. And the auto exposure has a tendancy for too much, forcing you to manually under compensate (easy to do, but annoying to have to do) in many lighting conditions.Necessary add-ons: Nikon makes a great $25(?) leather case. An additional battery (the after market ones for other Coolpix cameras were good enough, but not available yet for the 8800). A filter lens cover (so you are cleaning that and not the lens). And a Birt Sirkin CheatSheet. And you might consider buying (eventually) one of those real small (e.g. Casio) cameras as a pocket model when your photo needs are light.General complaint about digital cameras: Low light sensitivity. What's this 'noise' BS. This is (almost) 2005. We should be shooting at ISO 1200 with no noise.", "Date": "December 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "8800 - many strengths but not a perfect camera", "Author": "8800 User", "ReviewID": "R3BXC4FR0FF8Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after several weeks of researching the varioius 8MP cameras on the market today.  I've had it for about two weeks now and this is what I can tell you:Pros:1. Great zoom! 10x zoom is great for getting close to your subject.2. Macro works really well.3. VR (Vibration Reduction) works extremely well.  I have done several hand-held shots down to 1/4 second shutter speed that have no noticeable camera shake. Very cool!4. Good autofocus speed. Even in low light w/ AF assist lamp, providing you're at the widest angle (35mm). See con 1 below. Good autofocus speed even at 350mm providing there is ample light (daylight).5. Feature rich camera that produces exceptional images.Cons:1. Poor autofocus in low light, even w/ AF assist, while using zoom.  When taking pictures when using any zoom in our family room the camera will OFTEN miss focus or not focus at all, even when the AF assist lamp is activated.2. SLOW 2.8-5.2 lens. This lens really hampers focus ability in low light.  I found that the zoom really only works outdoors w/ ample light. I did not think the slow lens would be a real issue, but I am surprised at how often it gets in the way.3. Manual focus.  If you need this feature, keep looking.  The manner in which Nikon implemented autofocus on this camera is useless (really, it is).  This is a real problem only if AF cannot get a lock (see #1).4. Nikon specific filters and lens attachments.  Nikon chose to make the filter ring on this camera a non-standard 53mm thread.  If you plan to use filters, you will be purchasing the Nikon filters made specifically for this camera.  If you have an assortment of filters you would like to use w/ the 8800, there is an adapter ring (not Nikon) available, but some results have vignetting.4. Noise at high ISOs.  Similarly to other 8MP cameras this one too suffers from a lot of noise at ISO higher than 100.5. Does not include lens hood. Most other cameras in this lineup include the lenshood.  Not a major issue, just another 35.00 expense if you actually need it.A word about CA/PF.. Like all other 2/3\" CCD 8MP cameras this one is not immune to PF.  At this time I have not noticed a _serious_ amount of CA/PF in high contrast areas.  I can tell you that it does indeed exist. I have seen it as green, red, blue and purple fringing. So far it has not been a huge drawback and I don't consider it a major issue.Overall I am impressed with this camera and its many features (including advanced features).  I can't say enough about the zoom and VR capabilities, these two features set this camera apart from many of the others.  I can live with the deficiencies as the quality of the images and build of the camera more than make up for where the camera fails.-R", "Date": "November 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "8 X 10 = Amazing!!", "Author": "Sinister Minister", "ReviewID": "R114CWL4W7ZB8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi there SinMin Here again! I'm going to assume you've just come over from the 8700 page, if you haven't you may want to check it out and compare my reviews on the 8700 & 8800. Okay. Now as I've said before when it comes to digital cameras the absolute love of my life has been the Sony F-828, I say has been because I now have a mistress called the 8800! So for the sake of argument I'm going to compare the 8800 to the 8700 and the 828. Lens: while quality goes to the Sony zoom and function go to the 8800 hands down, the 8700 has nice range but the 8800 is plain fantastic. VF mode: the process by wich the camera compensates for hand movement at slower shutter speeds resulting in great ambient light photography (I tend to hate flashes!) POW!! 828 and the 8700 blown right out of the water here!Not to mention the 8800 has retained all of the great Nikon scene modes (Including that Panorama thing), My beloved \"Bulb\" Function, Time lapse function(also available on the 8700), and the ability to correct your exposure after you take your shot right in the camera! Again ouch goes Sony! Controls: Sanity at last!! Nikon took the hint and gave the 8800 a familiar control interface which makes this camera 110% more user friendly than the 8700. ISO noise: Its no secret that high ISO numbers and digital cameras equal noise but I noticed a slight improvement with this on the 8800 over 8700, much more so than on the 828.And as I said before maybe it's me but the Nikon images seem to clean up better than my Sony shots tend to.Nikon also corrected my pet peeve about the 8700 by putting AF sensor OUTSIDE of the flash housing(thank You). Other pros: I(at least) noticed quite a bit of image improvement over the 8700 And I thought the 8700 shots were great, the 8800 was a bit better (Probably due to the VR feature) Another means the 8800 surpasses its little brother and the sony is the variation in image formats it can capture. Besides RAW and Tiff, the 8800 can capture 4 degrees of JPG files, (Basic, Normal, Fine and Extra which captures images at 1-2 compression) Get out yer gig card boys! Over all picture quality just barely goes to the 828 (that CCD is hard to beat)Dual memory capability, and overall design are all pro's in the 828's favor. But on virtually every other front the 8800 either matches or beats the Sony.And while the 8800 is a difinitive replacement for the 8700 they remain cameras with two different personalities (thats why I own and love both!)Other improvements over 8700: aside from the much needed improvements in design as well as zoom capability, it seems as though the 8800 shutter to apature function is a little tighter than the 8700, in other words my settings seemed to work better on the 8800. Now for the drawbacks, first off know one thing... this is a freaking HUGE!! camera!!! Only the 828 is longer and heavier (for me this is not a bad thing, but for some of you it will be) Speed as with the 8700, the 8800 just does not have speed (this is another area where the 828 wins out) either in start up or general picture function, this is strange considering the speed demon Nikon makes that goes by the name D-70! Noisy lens: I was told that the unusually loud noise the lens makes when you pull back focus or shut down the camera is normal by Nikon's customer service department, but I think it was excessive and should be something for correction on the next model (just a thought). These things aside, when you factor in all the goodies packed into this monster I can say this- \"I now have 2 right hand cameras.\" As I mentioned using the 8700 I shot a series of sunset photos using the \"sunset\" scene mode, I did the same with 8800 (same shoot in fact) and if you can believe it the shots were even better (I love that zoom with VR!) And as far as low light photography (long exposure) I have used few better.With my low light work even at a realatively high ISO, the shots were crisp and sharp.The biggest plus is that unlike the 8700 and in some ways the 828 the 8800 is easy to navigate and use most photographers will be able to get a great shot right out of the box, and that definitely will not happen with the 8700 or 828! Battery life: again this one goes to Sony, the first time I used my 8800 I killed the battery (doing long exposures) so I need to buy yet another AC adapter - the one for 8700 won't work! (what is it with Nikon and included accessories anyway?) Heres a pet peeve for you the 8700 & 8800 use completely different USB cables, AC Adapters (sold seperately), Batteries and chargers. as well as the most confusing array of exstension lenses and adapter tubes imaginable! Whats up with that? And yes I bought the lens hood for the 8800, and unlike the 8700 this one looks nice and normal (A flower hood to be exact) Conclusion: If your ready to step up (and I mean Up) to a pro quality camera, If you want to own and shoot with a piece of digital history this is your camera. For the novice looking to move on up, the 8800 is currently your only and best option, while I love the 828 as well as the 8700 they are fussy complicated cameras, the 8800 is not. even tho it is as powerful as the other 2 (more so in some cases)! This is the only camera I have found to date that I would reccomend as highly as the F-828. How should you decide? that depends on the type of photographer you are.(read my reviews and decide) The 8800 is by no means a toy, believe me it is very much a advanced photographic tool, just a little more user friendly. Bravo to Nikon! Sorry to Sony! I guess I just have to learn to shoot with two cameras...two very BIG cameras..WHEW!

If you shoot mostly landscapes, get the 8400, the wide angle on it is the best around.THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA.Don't expect to zoom to 10x and take a good picture in anything less than bright light. You will need some support, ideally a tripod. This isn't a problem with the camera, it is basic physics. No other camera is this category will do any better. The image stabalization helps, but will not fix everything. Make sure your expectations are reasonable and this camera will exceed those expectations. You will be unhappy if you think you can use this or any 8x, 10x+ camera handheld in any light or zoom length.You'll get great images with either the Extra or Fine mode (jpg).Stay away from the Hi (Tif format), there is no benefit and it takes forever to save. The resulting file is huge.RAW is excellent, but slow to save. You can put it in burst mode and take several images while it is saving.There is no CF card included with the camera. Get at least a 12x or better CF card. The Sandisk Ultra or equivelant work very well. You'll want a 512 or better if shooting at the largest images size and quality. A 512 will hold about 67 images at 2592 x 1944 in Extra, 45 at RAW and 124 at Fine. I'd recommend two 512 cards rather than one 1GB. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Parisi", "ReviewID": "R1C2HRSYYPTPKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 8800 is one of the best 8mp cameras out on the market today.  As a photographer, in my early days, I was after sharp pictures.  The 8800 delivers in this area and has one of the best zoom lens of any digital camera.  I've compared them all.  If you love macro photograph you will love the 8800 with VR.  VR technology allows and adjusts for camera shake.  It will not work miracles but it does work and will give you sharp pictures when other cameras will give you a blurred pic.  The 8800 is built like a tank with an all magnesium body.  The buttons and dials are all first class and have a high quality feel to them. The camera feels good in my hands and is very ergonomic.  One of the greatest joys of this camera is that it is an easy to learn and use.  The camera has many features that are easy to get to without toggling through an lcd screen. The 8800 uses a dial on the top of the camera where the \"most used\" features are quickly available.  The 8800 has many positives.  Fast AF in normal lightning, incredible sharp pictures, a macro lens to die for (snapped a few sharp macro shots without a tripod that were razor sharp), a bright LCD screen that swivels any way you want, a great viewfinder that is accurate, infinity mode, several shooting modes (aperture priority, shutter priority, true manual, programmed mode), and excellent battery life all in a compact package.  Some of the negatives:  Dim lightening situations are not the Nikon's friend.  I'm taking about a dimly lit room or no light at all. I simply turn on a light and I'm ready to go.  If you do lots of birthday parties and are trying to capture the action in total darkness this camera is not for you.  Although, there are work arounds.  Focus with the lights on and then take your shots with the lights off.  Another negative are the write times. The camera has minimal lag.  When you press the button the camera takes the pic without any noticeable lag.  However, in the highest JPG mode the camera takes a few seconds to write to the CF card.  Unless you're doing action photography this shouldn't be a problem.  And the 8800 has burst modes that allow you to take multiple shots blazing fast when you press the shutter.  You will not be able to refocus or compost the pic.  The viewfinders go black too.  I don't see myself using these modes.  There has also been concern about manual focus on this camera.  It is useless but so is the manual focus on every other digital camera I tried including the FZ20.  Honestly the camera can do a better job then your eye anyway, IMHO.  If you want manual focus you'll have to pony up for a DSLR which has interchangeable lenses:  You'll pay a lot more for a Nikon lenses with VR then you will for the 8800.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R18F9TVS0MEZAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own three 8 mp digicams--the Nikon 8800, the Minolta A2, and the Olympus 8080.  My Minolta sees use mainly in sports situations where its manual lens and fast focus are great assets, and I'm less concerned about sharpness.  The 8080, in good light, takes the sharpest and cleanest pictures.  The 8800, however, is the camera I carry with me most days, because of its versatility and the great images it is capable of producing.  For me, the 8800's greatest two \"flaws\" are slow speed and high noise in dim light.  It is relatively slow to focus, especially at long zoom lengths, if you do not pre-focus.  It is slow to record, especially if you shoot a series of images.  Noise becomes clearly present in low light images shot at ISO 200, and the noise at ISO 400 is, to me, intolerable.  Noise can be discernable at ISO 100 if the light isn't good.  The lens is slow at long zoom.  In good conditions, however, the 8800 takes beautiful pictures that can be blown up to 8-1/2 X 11 and larger with breathtaking detail.  I've been amazed at the clarity of pictures the camera will produce at maximum zoom.  In more challenging light situations, the camera generally does at least as well as the other digicams I've used.  Colors are usually accurate and vibrant, and the 8800 can capture up to five images in a quick series.

A great outdoor/indoor camera. 10X optical zoom delivers razor sharp images with the highest detail even at the full zoom. VR works well to compensate camera movements. Produces life like images in any shooting condition. LCD and viewfinder are good too. Almost full manual control over everything. Menus are easy to follow and works well. In camera editing is a good tool to adjust contrast and sharpness. Eliminates red eye also. Smaller copies of pictures can be created within the camera and this is very useful if you are planning to e- mail your pictures because you dont need to resize the images once you have downloaded the images to your computer. Battery is powerful but better to have an extra one. Needs high speed CF cards like Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme 3. TIFF and RAW images are out of this world but takes up lot of writing time and space. Startup time is around 3 seconds but camera has power saving stand by mode which is very effective.

The answer is YES it was.  The extra mp makes a very big difference and the overall improvements over the past three years have been dramatic.  Rather than giving an amateur's review of this camera let me steer you to professional reviewer sites.  The nice thing about these sites is that if you decide this camera is not for you then they have reviews on cameras that you just might like.[...]I didn't find the supplied software exceptional but it does give you a place to collect your photos.  Also these days I do not usually print my photos.  I save them to CD's or DVD's and play them back on the TV set, I find this a much nicer way to keep photos and then to view them.The camera does have some shortcomings but I think overall it is excellent.  If you take photos in near dark then it will not focus.  I take photos inside and outside where there is usually existing light so this is no problem for me.Not a shortcoming is the little remote control that I just love.  You set the camera on a tripod, get it set up for taking a picture, hit the timer, go get yourself in the picture then push the remote control and you have your picture, NICE!  Then it's very convenient not having to carry a tripod for the telephoto shots, the Vibration Reduction feature sees to that.Years ago going on vacation meant a big bag of lenses, bodies, etc but with the 8800 that's no longer necessary.

Years ago I worked as a still photographer (large format) and have had many years of experience with film cameras. My previous digital cameras were: Olympus 360, Canon G2, Minolta Z1, Sony U30. The Nikon 8800 represents my first serious jump into a more capable digital camera.I give the camera a thumbs up, but Nikon made some mistakes that might give pause to some shooters.1) The autofocus system is good, but falls short of other cameras I've used. It is easily fooled with less than ideal situations. Even choosing AF area can leave you with soft shots from time to time. Overall you can achieve a high success rate, but my tiny Pentax Optio S5I has a superior AF system WITHOUT the AF assist light. In side by side tests, the Minolta Z1 and Pentax could both grab focus (in CERTAIN situations) when the 8800 couldn't. This is not to say that the AF system on the 8800 is poor. It's just not as good as it should be for a camera on this level. I've already read of other complaints regarding low-light focus issues in other forums and you'll see plenty more if you search around.2) Luckily, Nikon knew this would be a camera for the more serious shooter and added a manual focus. Amazingly it is all but totally useless. A unmarked bar indicates focus position and it's quite vague. With it's electronic finder, you have many soft shots using the manual focus. The Nikon manual mentions sharp outlines when in focus, but like other users I can't see this. Not adding a distance scale is a crime and a actual focus ring would have made this camera a killer! To make matters more insulting Nikon didn't even add a focus area enlargement in EVF found on sub 300 dollar cameras. My Optio S5I has a usable manual focus, but the 8800 doesn't???3) The SB600 and 800 flash will work with the 8800!!! Yay! I knew that the flash units had a better AF assist light that would aid the focus situation and, of course, make for better indoor shots. WRONG. The AF assist feature set on the 600/800 WON'T WORK with the 8800. This was confirmed by Nikon tech support. So I must pay full price for 75% of a flash?4) Nikon chose to at least delay your chances of buying aftermarket lens add ons with it's unique filter thread. Bzzzzzz! Nikon wasn't too bright and brought accessories to market late. Go to the Nextphoto sight and save money and expand your choices.5) A two inch LCD would have been nice, though the 1.8 is \"enough.\"6) The 8800 optics will NOT match the D70 for ultimate sharpness and detail. No way, no how. It's the price you pay for the long zoom. But we all knew that!7) I really wanted the battery grip...but 169.00 for a plastic shell??? It feels cheap, especially the buttons. Shockingly so. Even the guy at B&H; Photo laughed at it! Buy the flash instead as that will actually expand the camera's capability. The AF Assist light on the 8800 is not in the best place and can be easily obscured by a finger.9) This is no lightweight camera of course. I bought the tiny Optio S5I for those times when I might not want to lug the 8800 around. My friend with an 8800 felt the same way and bought the slightly larger Sony L1. (Off Topic, The L1 and Optio are fine little snapshot cameras!)NOW, reading all of this you might think that I hate the 8800. Not so. It's a great camera and I have taken shots of my new baby with it that are jaw dropping. I suppose that the flaws are more glaring in light of how much of the camera is done right. It is a ultra capable prosumer unit with excellent feel and tremendous ability. This is a great camera to own while waiting for the DSLR field to improve and become more affordable.I hope this review was helpful to some of you.

I especially appreciate the vibration reduction. It's tough to go from this camera to another one and deal with a shaky zoom. But that's what I'm doing now because:Bad: For the second time in less than a year, my camera's in the shop (under warranty) being fixed because, out of the blue, a \"lens error\" stopped all functions on my camera. Last time, I had the camera for less than two months when this happened. I just turned off my camera and heard \"click, grind, click,\" and \"lens error\" appeared on the viewer and completely disabled the camera. Last time it took more than a month to get back the camera from Nikon. Also, Nikon isn't too quick on supplying items. I had to wait three months to get my lens filter.The Coolpix 8800, like many other digital cameras, doesn't have the immediacy of a film camera. So it takes a fraction of a second to actually take the photo after I push the button. In the world of pictures, that fraction of a second is important. Also, the recycle rate on this camera is slow. I often miss a second shot because the information takes too long to save to the memory card. These two problems are significant in capturing moments ranging from kids' birthdays to wildlife coverage to sports moments.The menu isn't the easiest I've encountered. It can be difficult to navigate. I'm not a novice, but I do like user-friendly equipment.Good: This camera has taken some of the most beautiful photos in my portfolio. I've even blown up some to print on 11x17 printer paper, and they're still gorgeous.I love SLRs, and this has that very comfortable, familiar feeling. I had to relearn photography styles for my point-and-shoot digital camera, not so for this one, where I can take much of my SLR style and apply it here.I like the movable view screen. I can hold up the camera above my head, but tilt the screen and still see the picture.The video option is great, but I wish it had unlimited video time.Like most digital cameras, this one uses a lot of power; so, buy an extra battery. Also, I initially bought 512 MB cards, which turn out to be about the equivalent of only a couple rolls of 36 picture film. If you're serious about photography, buy the 1 GB cards. Also, consider purchasing a seperate flash and flash battery for better light.Update: I had to take in the camera for repair once more. It was shortly before the warranty expired. Because it was for the same problem, I asked for a replacement camera. The manufacturer wouldn't replace the camera and would only update the firmware. I feel I gave them the opportunity to fix the camera, but the didn't. Now, if the camera acts up again, I will have to pay to fix something that should have been covered by warranty. I feel like I cannot depend on the camera working when I need it, so I now take a back-up camera with me.

After a disappointing experience with the coolpix 8800 from Nikon I decided to return the 8800 in favor of the D70 DSLR from Nikon with the Nikkor 18-70mm lens kit. Like some people, I was under the (okay, silly!) impression that the 8800 could deliver near DSLR like shooting in a more compact camera. Not even close, especially if you shoot with challenging lighting conditions (low contrast).The 8800's amazing potential is shot down by it's AF firmware, lack of manual focus that works and some generally bad choices by Nikon to keep it from posing a threat to the D70. Read on!Shooting in low/poor light is a subjective condition. Just what is \"poor light?\" Well, I'm not sure everyone will agree, but ANY room with indirect lighting will pose problems for the 8800 with some subjects, especially at moderate zooms. The 8800 was a disaster in these areas, and all combinations of settings were tried. If you visit various forums, you'll see quite a bit of talk about this. You'll see wonderful pics from the 8800 taken in near darkness. Be warned. The 8800 is not a consistant performer. ANY camera can produce great results at this level. It's merely a question of how much the camera \"gets between you and the picture.\" Like several others tried, I placed the 8800 on a tripod and attempted to focus on my wife in dim light. At times the camera was perfect and sometimes it hunted and hunted and \"confirmed\" poor focus. No thanks!Sadly, many people don't look at performance when they buy a camera. They look at gee-wiz features like VR, long zooms and high Megapixel counts. They look at sample pics and imagine that they can get the same results, never considering the performance barriers inherent in any camera. Being able to quickly get the shot is every bit as important as optical quality, unless you'll always be shooting still-life. The 8800's slow focus, poor AF overall, shutter lag make it a complete failure at it's price point.And so....I had the 8800 and now I have the D70. The 8800 is a fancy toy and for many folks it's \"good enough.\" They are willing to \"work around\" the focus issues and shutter lag. They insist that a 10X zoom and VR somehow makes up for the other problems. \"Every camera has flaws\" they say. I say, \"No Thanks.\" Not for 800 bucks plus extras. Ask yourself: Do you really want a camera with an AF Assist light that has a mere 5 foot range? Do you want to constantly seek \"brighter\" objects at the same subject range to achieve focus? Do you want a pricey camera with no fully compatable flash? That's right: The SB600 and SB800 flashes WON'T enjoy wireless modes and improved AF assist with the 8800! An amazing flaw. Do you want a camera at this level with no usable manual focus? In manual focus mode a sliding indicator appears with NO DISTANCE Scale! Still worse, there is no center enlargement area allowing you to have a chance of manually focusing by eye. The manual actually says you can see \"sharp outlines\" when proper manual focus is reached. Not so. A \"lowly\" Konika Minolta Z1 has a usable manual focus that actually works. The list goes on. Frankly, the Panasonic FZ20 is a better all around shooter.The manual focus issue alone is a deal breaker for me and will be for others. Without manual focus it isn't a fully manual camera...period. In various forums, 8800 owners complaining about focus were handed a lot of abuse, much of it from Nikon fans who don't even own the camera. Still worse, people who did have the 8800 were defending it with no idea of what the D70 did better. They just read \"10X, VR and 8MP\" wowee! Here's my credit card! And guess what? I did the same thing. Luckily, a good store allowed the swap. Live and learn...when you can! I can defend the 8800 in just one respect. In good light and outdoors, it can satisfy the shooter with excellent results. No other ultra-zoom can match it's optical quality at this time. The VR can be a real help as well. It's a real shame that Nikon built such a mediocre camera around such a fine lens.Is the Nikon D70 DSLR or other entry level DSLR a solution??? Well, I think that the D70 with 18-70 lens ALONE is better than the 8800 by a mile. The D70 is larger, but it's in the SAME SMALL BAG (Lowepro Ex160) that held the 8800. Also in the bag is a second lens, lens hood and other doo-dads. Around my neck the D70 is certainly larger and heavier. But guess what? I'm a grown man and I can carry an extra pound or even two! If I'm trudging up a mountain side, the D70 will be in a bag no bigger than the one that held the 8800. It's not like the D70 with lens weighs 10 lbs and is hanging from your eyelashes! This \"weight\" issue is just plain silly. The D70 handles like a real camera because that's what it is. Is it much more expensive? No, no way. The kits lens is excellent and gives 4X zoom. That's plenty for most folks and I've been using a 50mm 1.8 prime outdoors with great results as well. The most common FL used sure isn't 350mm! So the price difference between the D70/8800 is around 230 bucks. The D70 has a better faster lens, faster EVERYTHING, filters that fit, and wowee, even a lens hood. You can spend more money to make the D70 have the same type of lens as the 8800, but you can NEVER make the 8800 do what the D70 can do for any price. If you want a very portable camera, don't be silly claiming the 8800 is anything close. It weighs the same as the D70 body and isn't fitting in many pockets. That's why I have a tiny Pentax 5MP camera smaller than a credit card.Comnpared to the pricey 8800, the inexpensive Pentax locked focus better and without an assist light as did the Minolta Z1 at greater FL. The Pentax is a far better camera if I want to travel light. By the way, my wife used the D70 for the first time today and took great shots. She really liked it. Weeks ago she didn't understand why the 8800 wouldn't take a pic when she hit the button. Shutter lag, I explained after she missed a shot.Now I know the 8800 fans (and those who complain about apples and oranges) will not take kindly to this review. I only ask that anyone wondering about the 8800 to TRY it first. Try it in low light. Test the lag. And if you were considering the D70 (or another DSLR) AT ALL, run (don't walk) from the 8800. It's flaws far outweigh it's strengths FOR ME. That's the bottom line, folks. I think the 8800 is a toy, while the D70 (or other DSLRs) isn't. If you have the 8800 and don't have the D70, you really don't know the whole story. You're welcome to judge for yourselves as we all must. If this review angers anyone...remember, they are JUST CAMERAS.Here's a TYPICAL shot from the D70.

This is not a \"first-digital-camera\"; it's better suited for people who are pretty familiar with digital cameras and are looking for a camera that can be grown into.You can choose the \"point-and-shoot\" option or any of several manual options.  If you wish to employ the manual controls, the camera DOES take practice.  There are a lot of bells and whistles, as someone else mentioned, and I would highly recommend reading the instruction manual and experimenting with it before you take it on a big vacation (and bring the manual too).The image quality is fantastic, even when you are maxing out the zoom.  I take my pictures at 8MP and \"fine\" quality; anything larger is just overkill unless you're printing 20\"x30\" prints.  The Nikon has the in-camera option of creating a compressed copy of any picture you take (for e-mailing, etc.).I use the Macro feature a lot, and I took a picture of a caterpillar on a plant and even at a 4x6 print size, I could see the hair folicles on its feet.I also appreciate the Vibration Reduction feature (which you can turn off) and the flip-out LCD screen.  Before I purchased it, I looked at the Canon 6MP Digital Rebel (which felt too big in my hands) and the Sony 8MP (which, like most Sony items, is of good quality but pricey).  I ultimately decided on the Nikon because it felt comfortable in my hands, had a good reputation, and had high resolution and a flip-out screen.There is lag time, as there is with any digital camera.  I don't notice that it's any better or worse than other digital cameras I've used.

There are so many buttons, options, and gadgets that a novice would be very confused, even though it comes out of the box ready for just basic point-and-shoot photgraphy.

I sent it in for service just two weeks later, on April 3rd.  It has now been in the shop for more than 6 weeks.  The main problems were severe focusing problems.  A minor problem was that the cable to transfer pictures to the computer didn't fit securely to the camera and I needed three hands to hold the cable to the camera and manipulate the mouse at the same time.  It has been six weeks, and I have yet to hear anything about the focusing problems, despite many e-mails of correspondence.  The latest e-mail from the service department indicated they still hadn't checked on the focusing problems.  As for the cable connection problem, Nikon Repair said the connection was bent and wanted $230 (almost 25% of the camera's cost) to fix it.  I told Nikon Service during the first week they had it that I didn't want to repair the connection because it was more of a nuisance. The camera connection port is larger than either the cable end or the camera connection.  The camera cable port is straight on the side of the camera, but the connection inside it angled.  If the connection is out of alignment, inserting the cable end can bend it. The bent connection problem isn't the first with Nikon Coolpix cameras and probably won't be the last.  Case in point, I am taking an Adobe Photoshop CS course at our local Vo-tech, and the Vo-tech Photography Instructer sits beside me.  I lamented my Coolpix 8800 problems, and he told me he had similar problems with another Coolpix model.  He was surprised that Nikon wanted $230 to repair my camera, because his camera also had an angled connection and he bent his.  Nikon repaired his under warranty.  He also had focusing problems with his Coolpix, even using a tripod, and he had to use work arounds to use it.  His experiences convinced him to switch to Canon.  As I stated in my original review, I encountered some of the focusing problems that other reviewers have discussed.  The camera focus often hunts when there is only one item in the picture - such as a bird on water.  When there are lots of things in the picture, like a bird in the middle of tree limbs, it gets worse.  When using the telephoto to take pictures of moving birds and animals (my intended pastime), most of the pictures were completely out of focus.  I felt lucky to get one decent picture out of ten.  I was sold by the promise of VR, but it didn't help that I could tell.  The Coolpix 8800's outdoor, non-telephoto pictures had a higher rate of success, but there were still some out of focus pictures. There have even been some out of focus pictures while using a flash.  I have never experienced these problems on my more than two years old HP 850 digital camera.  I feel I should have done more research before purchasing the Coolpix 8800, and I would advise others to do so, or maybe rent one like another reviewer suggested.  If I could, I would reduce my rating to 1 star due to the long wait on Nikon Service.  It has been more than six weeks, and I still don't know when the camera will be returned.  It takes about 3 - 5 working days to get an answer to an e-mail, and I'm still waiting for a response as to when Nikon Repair thinks it might be able to start checking on the focusing problems.", "Date": "April 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Capable, but flawed instrument.", "Author": "April Vawter \"Wilderness Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R1QF5702GBJUC0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera since March of '05, so I've had time to use it under a variety of conditions.  As of today, I have shot just under 4,000 shots with favorably mixed results.The best photos are great, with good color saturation, sharpness and overall quality.I shoot at low compression JPEG, \"Extra Image Quality,\" 8MB file-size, which translates to a usually selected ASA equivalent of 50.  Even with \"Vibration Reduction,\" I use support most of the time.  Normally, I either shoot in Program mode, varying exposure compensation and bracketing a lot or Aperture Mode to control depth of field, also bracketing.  After some experimentation, I found that most of the other bells and whistles are of limited use, at best.I almost never use the built-in flash unit, which, as with all built-in flash units, destroys image quality.  As an experiment, I also purchased an SB600, which works well mounted on camera, but drains the camera batteries after a few shots with the recommended remote cord.  I can compensate by triggering it on-camera, in Aperture Mode, set to way underexpose and using my SB-26 flashes as slaves at the correct exposure.  This leads to some major experimentation and some frustration.The L-Ion battery included with the camera is too weak for anything other than backup.  I had to purchase an MB-CP1 battery base so I could use easily replaceable NIMH batteries.  The base also adds balance and vertical shooting and zooming capabilities, similar to the units my Nikon film cameras use.  However, it is not very surdy by other MB standards.  Both jeweler's screws which held the tripod mount broke, and I had to super glue it back in the field.I have a website: (see my personal info) which is devoted to fine nature and wildlife photography and I always try to make my work the best possible.  This camera has been a useful, but a very flawed addition to my equipment.It was intended to replace a heavy field-pack at times, and it does, to some extent, under good conditions.My hope was that high-quality imagery in a purely digital mode would compensate for scratched film, high processing costs, and time consumptive scanning with film cameras.  This is the only catagory where I would give it five stars.  Productivity is really up.The camera has too many bogus \"program modes,\" a completely bogus built-in flash, semi-bogus LCD-viewing, although the multi-position screen has come in as a useful appendage at times.The autofocus is often frustrating.  The Normal, Distant and Near-focus switch, which is useful, is positioned in a really bad place where it often gets changed from pressure of the left hand, which can destroy photos without your realizing that it has changed. I lost a whole series of shots of a snowshoe hare in a snow storm because the LCD viewfinder wasn't detailed enough to show me the focus had shifted to near-only.If I carry my whole kit, including the camera, battery base, lens hood HN-CP14, SB600, extra batteries, compact flash cards and filters, my field pack is only 10 lbs or less heavier.  Of course, there is always a very sturdy tripod.Since I wrote this review I have begun to ready a large one artist show and in printing some 13X19\" pieces I have noticed some sharpness fall-off toward the edges and corners.  This is not acceptable.  I had planned to include a few 30X40\" prints, but I may have to use pieces shot with medium format film cameras instead of this ever-increasingly disappointing camera.In general, this is a camera which is capable of taking some awesome photos under the right conditions.  It has some really decent features, but many superfluous, unneeded, time-wasting and generally silly features.It will become the \"grab-camera\" that I keep in my trunk very soon.  I will be replacing it with a true DSLR that works with my normal lenses, although my field pack will get heavier again.", "Date": "November 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Slow Write Speed for RAW Format", "Author": "LarryAOL", "ReviewID": "RL8OH6NF7XMC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the CoolPix 8800 for about 2 months. It is a remarkable alternative to more expensive digital SLR cameras. My first priority was to buy a camera that had RAW (Nikon NEF) file format capabilities.
