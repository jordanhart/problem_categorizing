{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "Flipper \"camera guy\"", "ReviewID": "RACC27X1G7VW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after my old Canon A70 stopped working. I was looking for a quick replacement that was: low cost, had image stabilizer, slim and could record video with audio.This camera has fit all those requirements nicely.The pictures I've taken have come out extremely well in daylight.  In darker situations the anti-shake feature helps out a little.  I like my wife's sony t20 optical image stabilizer better, but the anti-shake works okay given some attention to keeping still.  The camera still does pretty well in low light situations, just hold it steady or use the soft flash feature!  There is no focus assist light for dark subjects so take a few pics if not using the flash.  I like natural light shots, without flash.The You Tube movie feature as well as the ebay picture mode are nice little extras I hope to use in the  future, but I'm unable to tell you how well they work now. As for regular video capture, I'm very impressed with the movie capture mode in 640x480.  It looks great on my tv when I plug the camera directly in with the rca to usb cable supplied. Although when playing back movies on the camera, people will tend to hold their thumbs over the speaker on the bottom left corner as they hold the camera to watch.  No biggie though!I like that they give you an icon in the Best Shot menu that represents the shooting modes.  But to get to the ebay or YouTube mode, it should be at the top of the list and not in the middle or at the end which they are respectively.  If they're pushing those shooting modes put them at the top of the list!The LCD screen is not quite as sharp as I'd like it to be, but it is still a good size.I advise buying a second battery. The battery lasts a decent amount of pictures depending on flash usage. Just buy a second battery anyway no matter what camera you buy.I've also dropped it on cement several times and it still works, so I'll give it kudos for being rugged.Overall, I really have been happy with this well priced camera from Casio.PROS: Slim, decent anti-shake function, great price, great picture color and quality, rugged.CONS: No focus assist light, speaker on bottom corner, LCD could be sharper.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Casio Exlim Digital Camera", "Author": "bgc23", "ReviewID": "R3K92M9U6V7MHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera at least 2-3 years ago from Amazon!

Golden", "ReviewID": "R31BNRF7Y1KHO8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this camera 18 months ago right before our daughter's birth.  It takes great pictures and video and is easy to use. It is also small and lightweight.  The files are a little large to upload on some internet sites and I have to downsize them in another program before posting.  Even more dissappointing is the fact that the first time we dropped it (on our deck), we had to send it in for repairs because the zoom mechanism broke(costing $100 because no one repairs cameras anymore apparently).  Now I'm looking for a new camera because the camera got jostled, not dropped, and now it won't focus and makes a ominous noise when turning it on. Definitely not for klutzes or people with small children!  Can't believe the other reviewer has dropped it on cement and it still works!!", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7 mega pixel, 3x optical\n2.6\" Wide Bright LCD\nFace Detection Technology\nYou Tube Video Capture Mode\nMPEG 4 H.264 Video", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z77 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Anti-Shake Optical Zoom (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412PP7fRaQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000UX0DRM"}}
