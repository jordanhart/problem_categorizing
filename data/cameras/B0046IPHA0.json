I bought three, installed them and one camera fuzed out with in a few days.  The other two are still going strong.  At night you can see pretty good, but most cameras the IR mainly illuminates the center your field of vision.  The mount is fair, it is mainly plastic, so that will minimize any rust.  Even with the failed camera I'm happy with them.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$75.99", "Features": "1/3\" Sony Super HAD II CCD. 550 TV-Line, NTSC: 811 * 508.\nLens: 3.6mm.
