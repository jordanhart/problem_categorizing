It has so many easy touch buttons on it that i didn't really need to read the manual.I got it right out of the box, hooked up the battery and the 512 MB scan disc and went staright to testing mode while charging at the same time. The zoom is incredible, the video was so clear that i actually thought of making a 15 min movie. It has different modes that you can set it to. It has a red eye remover button right there on the camera. Easy to set straight to the printer and mail out to friend.I noticed the self-timer button and took pictures of my family with me included.The best thing is that everything is just so easily displayed and one doesn't need a manual to start getting the work done.What a performance. Hopefully i'll keep it for years.Let me go back to stalking my Hp camera.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "The picture quality is less when prints are taken", "Author": "Sridhar Killampallt \"Sridhar\"", "ReviewID": "RC1WWU2FALK7E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as I got a good deal on Amazon.com.
