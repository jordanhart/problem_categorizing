{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheap camera that takes poor quality pics", "Author": "Shelly", "ReviewID": "R145CT83GIFFTS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted something inexpensive so that I could take pictures of my sewing projects and blog about them.  This fit the bill for being inexpensive, but it has been impossible to take a clear picture.  The flash makes everything very bright and washed out and if you don't use the flash it's blurry.  I have tried using my own lighting but nothing works.  I think I'd need a tripod to take a good picture with this, but that defeats the purpose.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8 megapixel resolution\nDelivers excellent picture quality. 8.5mm zoom lens\nOffers f/3.2 aperture and features an 8x digital zoom. 2.4\" color LCD display\nEnjoy easy focus selection and photo viewing.
