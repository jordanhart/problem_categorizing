{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Novelty Camera Where Form Trumps Function", "Author": "M.G. \"M. Gilbert\"", "ReviewID": "RK669H4TW6E0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The question arises as to whether this adorably cute mini replica of the classic Leica film camera is a sophisticated toy or a real camera with practical uses. As a long-time aficionado of the Leica M3, which I used for 20 years from 1960 until I finally retired it with the advent of SLR cameras with zoom lenses, I find this miniature a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era, but surprisingly, with a bit of care it is capable of taking quite decent pictures.This lifts it well above the toy category, but not without serious limitations. The accompanying \"mini\" manual is silent regarding some major technical details like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. It is essentially fixed focus from infinity down to two meters, with manual adjustments for 1 meter and 0.5 meters (19\"). It is aperture priority, with variable shutter speeds depending on lighting conditions. Based on a check of \"Properties\" after downloading, all my photos so far are at an ISO of 100, so that interior shots require a steady hand with a slow shutter speed, as the maximum aperture appears to be f3.7. A rather cumbersome flash attachment is available as an expensive accessory, and so it's best to avoid low-light photography with this camera. There is a very limited movie option, which I will most likely never use.The lens is 9mm, or 42mm in 35mm format, which users of typical point-and-shoot digitals accustomed to a 28mm wide angle zoom lens will find seriously limiting. A wide angle attachment is available as an accessory for $80, which I do not have, and which would detract from the camera's small-size advantage. Also the very helpful but non-adjustable optical viewfinder atop the camera is not usable either with the wide angle attachment or the 4X digital zoom option, but in that case the 2\" LCD viewing screen offers an acceptably bright and clear image in all but the brightest sunlight conditions. Internal adjustments can be made to White Balance and Exposure Value to compensate for over- or under-exposed images. The Leica-like film advance lever and rewind knob atop the camera are non-functional props only, which is a pity, as it would have been more impressive if they could have been integrated into operational features of the camera.Downloading photos to a computer and to an editing program such as Picasa is easy and permits corrections and enhancements. With 5.1 MP and a CMOS sensor, the resolution, color and contrast of most images are quite good. This is undeniably a fun camera to use casually and is certainly a conversation piece with other photographers familiar with the old Leicas, but in terms of performance it cannot compete with modern point-and-shoot minis that are equally small and similarly priced, but far more versatile.Bottom line: I fully agree with the reviewer who observed that the Minox Digital Classic Camera (DCC) rates a `5' for design and a `2' for function.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks better than the photos it takes", "Author": "Will Hard \"willard@u.arizona.edu\"", "ReviewID": "R2J84BS3XA9KPB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Made in Germany with a Leica lens and classic styling, the camera is a bargain with limitations:+  controls are easy to reach and use (mode/up/down/shutter release)+  6 degrees of zoom (controlled by up/down buttons)+  3 quality settings (low, normal, high)+  adjustable focal length (using a functioning ring around the lens)+  adjustable white balance (daylight or cloudy, lamp or tungsten) and exposure value (+ or - 0.3)+  detachable view finder+  video+  128 MB built in storage (accepts HD storage cards up to 16 MB, sold separately)+  self-timer+  wooden presentation box-  no image-stabilizationn (accepts a mini tripod, but that defeats the \"spy camera\" function)-  no built-in flash (external unit available, again defeating the \"spy camera\" function)-  apparently does not support Mac OS 10.7 (claims to support OS 9 and 10, but has no drivers for download; prepare to use a card reader)-  apparently no manuals for download from the Minox.com site (despite printed claims packaged with the camera)-  pricey though non-essential add-ons (if you want them, check Amazon for sellers packaging the camera with flash and accessories)Overall a fun camera if it isn't your only one. Five stars for looks, two stars for functionality.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun little camera!", "Author": "R. A. Guerra", "ReviewID": "R2IZ4QWA0JBU9X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to keep on me at all times when I'm out and about as my pro camera is too heavy and too pricey (if lost, damaged, or stolen). I've had this camera for about a month. The look and size make it a fun little gadget. Works like a camera phone. You must have a steady hand for sharp images. I think for the price it should offer a bit more function and quality, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it. Overall, I'm happy with it.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute but not worth it.", "Author": "Tim Garrett", "ReviewID": "RAMEKNMQ42OND", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This digital camera is cute and great conversation in a bar but it takes lousy pics.  Although it's a 5.1 MP digital camera, the pictures are blurry.  It is nearly impossible to take a clear pic, steady hand or not.  So for the price it is NOT worth it.  If it cost $20 or $30 like a toy camera, then it would be worth buying if for nothing else than the fun and conversations of it in a bar.  But then again, why waste those good photo opportunities with blurry result from a cheap digital camera?  Save your money and invest in a better camera!", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Images are only okay", "Author": "Tenna Merchent", "ReviewID": "R3MQRXDQSXSPRR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really excited about this camera because it is tiny and retro. Well the images are only okay. The focus is weak to say the least. There was not lens cap, and the instruction manual was not in English, so I had to get on-line and find one. After I got it all figured out and experimented with the images, they were not worth all the effort. The camera went back in the box, and now sits on a shelf in my office.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A-", "Author": "Denis", "ReviewID": "R10BT0CG4OK6UL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera was delivered promptly and appeared to be as represented; however, it would not take a charge. Contacted the Minox Corporate offices directly and they forwarded a ship label and sent the camera to them.  New camera came in and took a charge, and now we begin to play and see how it works. So far, so good and expect that it will work and play as advertised, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0037X2YGU"}}
