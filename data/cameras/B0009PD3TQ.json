It stays on 24/7.I can't say enough good things about it.It was pretty easy to hook up. (It helps if you are a \"techy\" kind of person)The image quality was pretty good for an analog system (considering its not digital)It has remained very reliable (as far as maintaining a connection)as I have not had to reboot this device at all.The construction and connectors are solid (you can feel the quality).Would I recommend purchasing this product?Absolutely !", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0009PD3TQ"}}
