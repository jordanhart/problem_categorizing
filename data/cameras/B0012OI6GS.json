{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One week in- A cool little camera", "Author": "Michigoon \"tech geek\"", "ReviewID": "R21X3MG39LI6G8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a fairly cheap point-and-shoot camera, the Nikon Coolpix S550 is a pretty neat piece of hardware. It's certainly not a high-end DSLR, but it's good at what it does, and it offers some nice pluses over other cameras in its price range.The good:-5x optical zoom is very good for a little camera like this, and is tops in this camera's class. I would like to remind readers that \"digital zoom\" really just crops out part of a picture to make it look bigger in the viewfinder while destroying actual shot quality, so please disregard the \"digital zoom\" on this or any camera.-10megapixel resolution is pretty phenominal, especially in this camera's price range, especially coupled with the 5x zoom. Dollar-for-dollar, you're getting a lot.-Shutter and record speeds seem great. Note that with megapixels this high, you're going to need a high-speed SDHC memory card if you don't want to see too much of the hourglass.-The high resolution and zoom really combine for wow power when you take movies with the camera. Although the mic is terrible and you'll probably just want to mute it, you can take movies of a pet where you can see every individual hair from a respectable distance if you so choose. On a one-gig card, I can shoot a half-hour of movies at this quality.-The camera's overall size is very comfortable. Not much taller and wider than a credit card, not much thicker than a thin paperback, and compeletely flat when it's powered down. Yet it's still roomy- I'm a 6'+ guy with stubby fingers, and I've never fumbled a button yet.-Tons of modes. The camera can take widescreen pictures or regular format, PAL or NTSC, and resolutions from standard tv (640x480) through the roof (over 3,000 vertical pixels). It has smile recognition, stabilization, various compensation filters including red-eye. It has Portrait, Outdoor, Indoor, and even Copy for taking pictures of documents just in case you're a secret agent on a budget. The basic Shoot and Smile modes seem wholly satisfactory, but this camera offers plenty of room to grow. Yesterday I took some very clear photos of moths in flight, with no adjustments other than setting the camera to high ISO.The not-so-good:-No optical viewfinder, only the digital screen. It's a very good and very big screen though, so this is mostly just for nostalgia's sake.-The camera doesn't have a dial for the various settings. Instead of just clicking over to Portrait or Outdoor, you have to hit a menu button and look around. This is a pretty small complaint overall, but I would have still preferred a wheel.-I've noticed that with a lot of low-end digital cameras like this, you can see that as the camera auto-adjusts it will show a perfectly sharp picture in the viewfinder, but keep adjusting until the picture becomes a bit blurry. Maybe this is just something about the way I take pictures, but I know this camera is capable of clearer shots. This is especially evident in extreme close-ups, such as under a foot away. The camera will adjust right up to a perfectly crisp photo for a moment, then keep going to a blurry mess before it snaps the shot. If I could just cut out the last few moments of zooming, I'd have gotten a perfect photo. I saw this same thing with a number of comparable cameras while doing in-store tests, and I'm puzzled as to what causes it (maybe I need to turn off the assist beam sometimes, I don't know). I'll have to check the camera's official site and such to see if I can find tips.-5x zoom, while really wonderful for the price range, still seems a bit stifling. Maybe I'm just at the point in my life where I need to own up to the truth and save up for a high-end SLR. 5x optical is certainly much better than the 3x zoom that comes with most comparable cameras.Overall, I really got this camera because it was time to upgrade from my old Canon A60. The A60 took really great photos in the right conditions, but it couldn't adapt to conditions well, and it had a very big delay between pressing the button and getting a shot. The Coolpix has already paid for itself with smile recognition- I'm a \"psychic blinker\" who manages to always shut his eyes the moment a photo is taken, and I haven't gotten a single photo of myself with my eyes closed, even doing close-ups with flash.If you're just starting out in the digital world, this camera has all the best features with a clear interface and instant point-and-shoot modes that require no calibration. If you're like me and you just need to find a smarter digital camera, you could do a lot worse than this one for the same money. If this camera suits your price range, you simply must put it at the top of your list. The only reason I'd suggest passing on this camera is if you've got significantly more money to spend on a higher class of camera.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera.....but........", "Author": "Ben Franklin \"GPS Crazed\"", "ReviewID": "R2HEQ05S9X7WIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this camera. The majority of the reviews were excellent. There were a few that were scary. Now i realize why. This camera is a great camera if you are willing to put the time in to learn all it has to offer and how to use it. It comes in cool, fresh colors which may be one of the reasons that people felt mislead. Although cool looking this camera is a sophisticated piece of equiptment capable of producing some great pictures for the average person, but it does require you to read certain portions of the manual or you will not be satisfied with the results.One criticism i read related to the fact that it did not take great low light pictures. Well if you don't adjust the camera to suit those lighting conditions then you won't be happy. However push two buttons and get into the right mode and you will find that you can take some of the best low light pictures around. You can't just drag the camera from the beach, to the museum and then to a house party and expect that the one setting is going to give great all around pictures. Although it's cool looking it is not an instamatic!!This is a great camera if you are willing to learn, otherwise you won't be happy.I am not a professional photographer and I found it very easy to go through the manual and learn what I needed to get great pictures all the time.This is a great camera, just not for everyone.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "small camera with big zoom", "Author": "LA in N.C. \"LA\"", "ReviewID": "R2KVY52FY83XLU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the camera and the photos. The zoom is good and unheard of for a camera this size. easy to use even without reading the manual. One problem, it comes with a rechargeable battery# Li-ion EN-EL11 but...I can't find anyone who sells it yet (I like a backup battery). The screen is large but I do miss the option of using a view finder, which helps in bright light.

It takes nice pictures under good lighting situations, and particularly outdoor situations. However, I've found a few issues with it:1.  ISO noise seems excessive.  The noise at ISO levels 400+ is really among the worst I have seen, even for a point and shoot.  As a result, it's really not my first (or second) choice for low lighting (often indoor) shots without using a flash.  It works well enough with a flash, but so do most cameras.  Trying to take non-flash pictures indoors with this camera is a chore because of the high level of noise at even moderate ISO settings.2.  Odd juxtapositions in the design.  For example, the camera cannot both date stamp and use its electronic vibration reduction function at once -- that's a very odd trade-off, and smacks of some very odd engineering decision.3.  Limited on-screen information.  While shooting it will at least provide your aperture and shutter speed, but it doesn't on playback, and there is no option for controlling that display information.  Other cameras (like Panasonic's DMC-FS3) display aperture, shutter speed, ISO and WB all on the playback screen.  I like to review these things when looking at an exposure to determine whether I want to adjust anything for the next one, and not being able to see this information on the review display is quite annoying on a camera that has been recently released.In all, this is a fine camera for quick outdoor shooting.  For virtually anything else I plan to do with a point and shoot, my first choice is Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FS3.  I'm not happy to say that, because I am generally a fan of Nikon equipment, and my digital SLR equipment is all Nikon ... but the Panasonic beats this camera pretty much across the board, I'm afraid, while also being slightly cheaper.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Camera I waited for!", "Author": "K. Martin \"phoenixflames295\"", "ReviewID": "R1EN7O1R0B344O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Tiny, light, has lots of features, but easy enough for my mother to use.Cons: No rechargeing cradle (yet?)\"I've been using digital camera's since many years ago when Apple made a ginormous creation that was just the most awesome thing ever. I've passed for years (about 12 of them now) on buying a digital camera as I have a very nice SLR 35mm, and wanted a camera with high quality, good durability, but be tiny, light and offer me a lot of the macro's I enjoy on my SLR.Nikon has created (at last!) the camera that meets my demands. Additionally, it is idiot-proof (turn on, push button, camera will handle everything else in basic mode), has built-in red-eye reduction, blink indicator (yes it tells you if your subject blinked!), a respectable LiIon battery, and besides its 50-some meg of on board memory, it has a SDIO slot for memory cards. For those who don't chase technology like others of us, SDIO is a newer-faster version of SD-card. SDIO is backward compatible with SD, mini-sd and micro-sd (if you have the necessary size-changing adapters). SDIO is FAST, and allows for much larger storage capacities than SD. Don't cheat yourself, buy a SDIO card to go with the camera. The camera is already fast enough, and doesn't lag from button to shutter, so give it the memory speed it is designed for!! My 4gb SDIO card gives the camera capacity for just over 800 pictures, but more importantly, I can fire off those pictures faster than I could with my SLR.The ONLY thing this camera doesn't have (or maybe I've just not found it yet!) is a recharging cradle. To recharge the battery, it has to be removed and placed in a charger. I'd rather have a nice cradle that charges the camera while downloading my pictures to my PC.Even with that one missing feature, the camera is a super-hit in my book. I paid street-price for the camera, which was a good deal to me. It can ONLY get better in price! But why wait, the camera is worth its MSRP...if you are in the market go grab one before the store sells out!\"", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "E.

I haven't experienced that at all. In fact, I recently bought a FujiFinepix as well, but this little camera put the Fuji to shame. The colors were much brighter and more vivid than those of the Fuji. It's the lightest camera I own, and it's very sleek and easy to use (the EASIEST to use).

Itis pocket sized and is 10MP, same as the $1,000 D80. The only two criticisms I have are that it doesn't shoot in RAW (not important to most folks) and it is difficult to see the viewing screen if you're wearing polarized glasses. Other than that, I love it. Simple to use and really handy. You can't beat the price for Nikon quality! We used it indoors at the Johnson Space Center and got great results with the flash. We took it on our boat while doing some salt water fishing (that's where I don't take the D80) and got the same great results! Image stabilization was a big plus on a rocking boat.

I had narrowed my selection down to the Nikon or a Canon Powershot Elph.  When I walked in to the store and asked the salesman what point and shoot digital camera he would recommend, he immediately said \"Nikon\", so I bought it.  Thank goodness the store has a 10 day return policy.  If you use the camera for a few days and do not like it, you can return it (along with the box and everything that came in it) for a full refund within 10 days of the date of purchase.  There is no restocking fee like many of the other local retailers.After using the Nikon Coolpix S550 for one day, I knew I hated it.  The shutter speed was slow, especially when using it indoors with a flash.  The red eye reduction flash was even worse...it flashed about 12 times before taking the picture and then would not focus (or didn't think it was focused), so it would flash and beep at me before the shutter would actually go off.  That made for a good 5 - 10 second lag between pushing the shutter and actually capturing the image.  Meanwhile, because the flash went off so many times, people were moving or talking by the time the picture was actually taken.  I really didn't want to have to say \"this is going to flash a bunch of times before the picture is taken, so just stay still and I'll tell you when the picture is done\" for the rest of the camera's life ( I had to do that with an old film camera of mine for years, it's not fun!).  The camera is equipped with red eye recognition and will supposedly correct red eye within the digital image after the picture is taken...doesn't that eliminate the need for the crazy multi flash?  It was bad enough that I hated that aspect of it, but the subjects who I was taking pictures of complained as well.Not only was the shutter speed slow, but the recovery time between pictures was long.  I knew going into it that the Nikon shutter speed was a bit slower than other digital cameras, but that in addition to the long lag time between pictures is unbearable.As for the facial recognition, it is non-existent.  Not once in all the pictures I took did the camera recognize and lock onto anybody's face.  I was taking pictures of people facing fully toward the camera too.  Now, I don't need facial recognition, but if the camera has it, it certainly should work.Also, the menus on this camera are difficult to maneuver through.  I think I would have had to carry the instruction book along with me at all times just in case I ever wanted to do anything other than auto focus!  The good news is the instruction book is very informative and easy to follow.I really wanted to like the Nikon, but I knew after that first night that I would be miserable with it.  I brought the camera back and purchased the Panasonic Lumix DCM-TZ4.  The Lumix is 200x better than the Nikon Coolpix!  It has 8MP, 10x optical zoom and up to 40x digital zoom.  It always recognizes faces even if it is only a picture of a face.  The images are sharp and beautiful!  The camera is a little larger and heavier than other compact digitals but I am thrilled with it.  I am sad to say that this experience with the Nikon has turned me off to their product completely.  It would take some major improvements in their product line to make me try a Nikon again.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA", "Author": "Carol K.

Pictures taken in doors are another matter. In moderate to low light, the camera can't seem to get the focus right even with center weighted focus.

The picture menus are so intuitive and easy to catch on.  The camera automatically adjusts depending on the lighting and the flash is very powerful.  After taking a few pictures at night, I wondered if I could take a picture in the dark and to my surprise this baby didn't let me down.  I turned off all the lights and took a picture and everything came out clear.  Only downside is that you can't tell what the camera is focusing on until after the picture has been taken.  A lot of the features are automatic and do not require a lot of thinking from the user.  It has a blink feature that tells you when someone blinks.  When in smile mode, the camera automatically snaps when the subject smiles (perfect for capturing hard to catch baby pics.) Just be careful, because it will snap a picture a soon as it recognizes a smile so I wouldn't use it on a group photo.  Oh and the zoom is superb!  The pictures come out clear and crisp even when you zoom all the way in! However, I did get some pics that looked dim when I was too far away, you just have to play with it to see what's a reasonable distance.  It fell out of my purse (while in a nylon case with minimal padding) onto the pavement and it is still kicking and snapping photos.  I bought this camera because it was cute, powerful, and within my budget, and after reading others reviews before I purchased it I decided I would give it a shot and I was not let down.

I have both cameras set on 5MP (that gives me the best quality/size ratio for normal photos) so it's not a resolution issue.  It just seems like there is nothing in crisp focus on the S550. If I run the 'sharpen' filter on the photos in Photoshop, they seem fine, but I shouldn't have to do that.I see that others have complained about the blurriness/softness of the photos, and others haven't.

But camera shake would explain blur, but not grainy.Well, I took the camera and took shots of this and that and then compared it to my Canon Powershot A610 (5 Megapixels). I took shots of the same items with both cameras and was...well...shocked! The clarity on the A610 was significantly better.Wish I had performed this experiment when I first purchased the camera. Would've returned it.Why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1? Well, it's cute, 5X optical is a great feature, it's got video and it fits in my shirt pocket.

But there is one thing that just astounded me.  Every camera I have and have had during the last 5 years I have, as well as every phone, and my son's PSP, and most MP3 players have used a standard mini-USB cable to connect.  I have several, and it's nice to carry one small cable for every device my wife, kids, and I have.  This camera however, uses a long skinny squarish connector that I've never seen before.  Worse, the connecting cable is HUGE.  It is bigger than the camera.  The USB and composite A/V cables are fused at the camera end, so there are 2 cords (1 USB and 1 component A/V) attached to a single large block that plugs into the camera.  So if I want to take pics off of the camera to email home while on vacation, I have to bring this huge double cord with a component A/V cord that I will never use away from home.  Using a small mini-USB cord that I already have for 3 or 4 other devices is not an option.  Even a small Nikon specific USB only cord would be better than what they did.  Just stupid.

Bugg \"JLuvBugg\"", "ReviewID": "R1D6D0PTCBGEE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not write many reviews but I feel the need to write one for this camera because it has been so helpful to me and I'm not happy about how many people have been dogging it. (Note: if you don't have time to read this, skip to my summation at the bottom)First off, let me say that while I am a bit of a technophile, I am in no way an expert on cameras. My five-star rating is not to say that this is the best product out there, but rather my level of satisfaction as an amateur photographer.I purchased this camera for regular picture-taking, nothing more. Go to a party or social event, got camera, no hassle. I had been using a 35 mm up until about 3 or 4 years ago and I realized how much money I was wasting on film. I also bought it to replace the digital camera that I had lost at Christmas 2007 (Nikon Coolpix L14). Plus, I was still waiting for the price of digital cameras to come down (bought this for $200), since I never buy new technology. I always wait for the most of the bugs to be worked out before I buy any electronic device.Let me say that if you are looking for a high-quality photo (10 MP gives incredible detail) in a compact, easy-to-use camera, look no further. I had read a wide variety of complaints, very few of which were valid or relevant. Let me say this much, if you are looking for a high shutter speed, this is not the product for you. It takes about three seconds from the time you push the button to the actual snap. But if you can be patient, the image quality is well worth it. I was pleased with the 7.1 MP on my L14 but I was thoroughly satisfied with the quality of 10 MP. The auto flash is pretty good at picking the setting. If you are not sure whether or not there is enough light, err on the side of using the flash, its always your best bet. I have had the camera for over a year and it is still going strong.I had read another complaint about not being able to charge the battery inside the camera. The BEST thing that they could have done is charge the battery externally. This camera is considerably smaller than my last Coolpix which had a built-in charger. Your best bet is to purchase another battery, doesn't have to be from Nikon (I bought one from a third-party), since you never know when it is going to run out. It lasts a while but you don't get much warning. I simply keep a back-up and throw the depleted one on the charger, which is so much smarter than having to plug in the camera. The battery charges pretty quickly. Anyone who complains about this is a moron who doesn't know how to accessorize properly.I've only been displeased with a handful of pictures and most of those were taken on short notice. Point-and-shoots are not designed for quick picture taking, that's what traditional cameras are for. This is for casual picture taking only, not for serious photographers. It has a very large LCD screen and what's even better is that you can view a picture and zoom in pretty close. The detail is astounding.Transferring files to my laptop is very easy. Some have implied that the software sucks but that's just not true. I don't know what other softwares look like but this one does the job well. It helps to have a USB 2.0 port. I purchased a laptop (in Sept. 2008) with USB 2.0 and noticed how much faster transfer was then my desktop (from March 2002). Once I transfer the photos, I create folders for different occasions and themes and sort them that way, which is pretty easy, unless you're a moron.One more thing I love about this camera is the quality of the video. I have shot some pretty impressive video with this thing. I didn't expect that and that was an added surprise. Another accessory you should have is at least two SD cards of at least 2 GB in size. On the highest quality setting with 2 GB, you can take 408 pictures or shoot 29 minutes and 51 seconds of video. You should also get a tripod if you're going to shoot a lot of video, and buy a camera case for a couple of bucks.In summation, this is a good camera with a high picture quality, if you are using it casually, accessorize it properly (extra battery, two SD cards >2 GB, and a carrying case), and use the flash appropriately.

MCHALE", "ReviewID": "R1SBPFG8X95KH6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tiny camera does exactly what I want it to do: take decent pictures and take up less space than my Nikon D40, which is just too bulky to carry around all the time.After taking about 100 photos with the S550 under a variety of lighting conditions, here are my impressions:The plusses:- Auto white balance is smart, even under incandescent lights, so you get pretty accurate colors. You don't get the ugly orange hue that many cameras (including the D40) produce when used in this lighting in the AutoWB setting.- I like that it shows the shutter speed by default after focusing, without showing any other distracting icons or information.  You don't get surprised by blurry shots, and the camera does seem to try to avoid excessively slow shutter speeds.- Pictures do look quite good at reasonable image sizes (6x8, or 8x10).- Panorama mode is a cool idea, but I haven't tried out the image splicing software yet.Minuses:- Noise (graininess) is visible at most ISO values.  Despite the 10MP rating you can not make 20 inch prints from this camera that look good up close.  Big prints will only look good for photos taken in bright outdoor light --- even using the flash indoors probably won't be enough.  Personally, I don't care, I even dial down to 3MP or 5MP to reduce the noise a little. (Note that this is not a Nikon S550 problem, it is a small CCD sensor problem, so it will be the same on any other camera with an equally small sensor)- This camera seems to inherit its older brother (D40)'s tendency to over-expose.  Not a big deal, since the exposure compensation is easy to dial-in.- No info screen on playback: as far as I can tell you can't view most of the shooting settings on pictures you have taken (it saves them in the EXIF data, so you can view them in your computer, just not in the camera).  I was annoyed by this at first, but I guess it doesn't really matter since there aren't any manual controls for you to play with to optimize things.- eVR is not real VR. I am skeptical about how well this will work, but actually I haven't had any blurry photos with this camera yet to try eVR out on.  This is how it should be, though.  The short focal lengths of these cameras should make it really hard to have much blur unless you want it, so I wonder whether VR is really necessary on cameras like this.Overall, I am quite happy with this camera.  If this were my only camera, I would probably rather have a bigger CCD sensor to try to cut down on that noise and take better low-light photos.  But bigger sensors need bigger lenses, which only fit in bigger cameras: you can't have everything. If you want a good tiny camera, given the constraints imposed by being tiny, this is a great choice.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera When You Learn To Use It", "Author": "Chuck \"Colorado 2\"", "ReviewID": "R3286L9JB3XIN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read many reviews on this camera--ranging from excellent to very poor.  We have owned the Nikon S550 for 3 months, and we would like to suggest a few basic adjustments which make this camera super.For indoor flash shots, the automatic setting is not perfect for all circumstances.  Use the \"exposure compensation\" selection menu (the switch with the \"+/-\" labeled on it) for many shots.  We find that adjusting the exposure down to -.07 is perfect for most indoor shots involving faces in normal lighting.  For action shots, set the exposure meter up a bit. We tried to make several manual adjustments for different needs, and this will work.  However, if you try the wide variety of settings within the \"scene\" selection, you will be amazed with what can be accomplished.  We live in Colorado--with many snow field type of shots.  The \"beach/snow\" mode is great.  The \"landscape\" setting is excellent for regular or zoom shots of scenery.  The \"sunset\" and \"dusk/dawn\" settings will knock you out for any shots taken at or near sunup or sundown.  \"Night landscape\" mode will give you a chance to take mood shots you never thought possible.  We are still experimenting with the numerous other scene modes.This is a 10 mega pixel camera, with 5x zoom, and with a Nikkor lens and Nikon quality.

It also appears to have a faster write time to the SD card (although that would also depend upon your SD card). The Nikkor lens also seems to be a big improvement, as does the 5x zoom. It takes an extra step to get to the 15 presets, but unless you are a seasoned photographer, you'll want to use the presets. They cover most situations, including \"museum\" and \"fireworks\" settings. The \"smile\" and \"blink\" features are cool, but I wish Nikon would get away from using the software to reduce shake. It would be better if they used an electro-mechanical solution like Canon or Pentax.The image quality is quite good, with excellent color saturation and accuracy of colors. The Macro setting gets you to within 10cm, which is not great, but still about the same as other point and shoot cameras. Video quality is good, but, as with all of these types of cameras, the mic picks up too much ambient noise to really be effective.

The apologists for this camera will claim that perfect results only come to those with the patience to pour through the instruction manual, negotiating their way,  Thesus-like, through this confusing and inscrutable Cretan's Labyrinth towards excellence.  I did, but I failed to vanquish this beast.  None of the suggestions in the manual yielded any change to the blurry and thoroughly objectionable photographs I had subsequently taken.

The regular zoom works great on its own, but once you add that extra zoom (when you cross the little bar on the screen) the pictures come out blurry without a tripod, but this happens with all cameras with digital zoom.Overall, I'd say it's like wrapping up a professional quality camera into a point and shoot camera that anyone can use!", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for great price", "Author": "Ann", "ReviewID": "RVX1YH9IO4RRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon's are always great buys and this is no different!

Since then, it has been perfect for my every need. But, for whatever reason, the price has been doubled since I got mine. In 2008, it cost only $168.00.

Obviously, it's back (or maybe just in stock until they sell them all, which would explain the price) but now it costs a fortune. You might as well go get a pro camera now. However, I would recommend this camera if you are just looking for a camera that will take basic, quick pictures or if you are loaded or willing to pay the hefty price.Pros:-Great Quality-Good Basic Pictures and Portraits-Cool Effects-UNBELIEVABLE ZOOM!!-Quick start-upCons:-terribly slow shutter speed (meaning NO movement for 5 seconds while taking the picture or it will most likely blur.-'eh' macro (I wouldn't neccesarily say it was bad, but you can't get very close to anything and make it look professional without holding some kind of a lens up to the lens. I hope that wasn't too confusing)-Indivisual battery charge (meaning that you can't take pictures while it's charging. That's probably normal but I found it kinda lame. You have to take the battery out to charge it)I usually have high expectations for a camera, though, because I want to be a photographer. For this price the way it is, I would say it's not worth it.

I love it to pieces, but I really needed something smaller for everyday use. I received a Nikon Coolpix S550 as a Christmas gift, and I had great expectations for it. I really, really wanted to love it. Heck, I would have settled for liking it. But honestly, I knew from the beginning it was a doomed relationship. There was too much lag between button-push and actual picture taking. Part of it's red-eye reduction (which does not work as often as I would like) was multiple flashing, which was jarring if you were the subject. When shooting on auto or actually changing to a set mode, say to \"Indoor/Party mode\", images appeared entirely too noisy. If noise was not an issue, then it was the flash being too intense, and a result, I had to mess around with the exposure. Its vibration reduction technology was virtually non existent. The slightest bit of camera shake or movement by subjects left the image blurred or with a halo. I grew really impatient trying to adjust ISO, exposure, flash compensation and whatnot just to get a clean image. Bottom line: overall image quality was really unimpressive. If you can't just leave it on A and shoot, then what's the purpose in a P&S; in the first place? I just don't believe I should have to adjust modes or white balance every time to get a decent photo. Also, navigating the menus was tedious. I know Nikon is a superb camera manufacturer. Their high-end DSLRs are out of this world. But something, and it's a BIG something, is really missing from this little camera.Today I exchanged it for a Canon Powershot SD790, and I am already impressed. Maybe it's because I already own a Canon, but the menus were super easy to navigate. I just picked it up, left it on auto and started shooting. I shot indoors and outdoors, never changed a setting and I am very happy with the clarity of the images. All the usual modes are still there, and then some. I have not captured red eye yet. I can even go into manual if I'm feeling finicky. There is much less lag between button-push and actual picture taking. I even asked my husband to move around and wave his arms and alas, no softness, no halo. I managed to exchange the cameras and pay a $10 difference. I am very happy with my new purchase.I'm giving the Nikon Coolpix S550 2 stars because:Image quality  **Ease of use **Appearance ****Features ** (plenty, but they don't always work)Price for quality *", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Coolpix S550", "Author": "T.

I haven't really done much with them, but I'm excited to. The camera is so much smaller than my older one that I'm afraid I'm going to break it and it usually falls out of my hand easily so I always wear the wrist band. Very happy with my camera. Just still unsure about the battery because my other camera used regular batteries. That's all.

I bought the S550 as an upgrade after a year of hard use of the S1. I'm in Iraq, lots of dust, dirt, things going BOOM &c.; Aside from that, the S1 didn't take the then new SD HC cards and the S550 does.What the S550 does NOT do that causes me to write a negative review of it is take decent macro photos. Even when I get green brackets on the screen more than one-half of the photo will come out blurry. Generally what happens is I won't even get green brackets, just red ones; those photos more often than not, turn out okay.Additionally, when set in macro mode, the lens keeps trying to focus on whatever direction the camera happens to be pointed in. There really is no such thing as close focusing with this camera, say anything less than 12 inches.Another thing I do not like about the camera. The S1 has a fixed lens which works fine. The S550's lens protrudes from the body, giving the aforementioned dust and dirt easy entry into the camera body.Lastly, and this is really annoying, one has to remove the battery from the camera and place it in a separate charger to charge it. The S1 has its own mini-docking station that charges the battery AND downloads the photos to my computer. The S550's separate battery charger is a real step backwards.Overall, I do not like this product, would NOT recommend its purchase to anyone and definitely would not purchase another one.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not Satisfied", "Author": "Meghi", "ReviewID": "R3U63FO6F3Z3D2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Panosonic and I am not satisfied.It takes great pics outside, but in my house (lighting ist good) the pictures come out blurry.

I was warned about Nikons and told to go with a Canon instead but I was sold on some favorable reviews and attractive commercials.The worst thing about this camera is that it does have VR stabilization which reduces the shake caused by the photographer but not of the subject. Do not buy this camera if you plan to shoot any moving subject. Even people waving will come up as a blur and if you have kids or pets don't even think about it. There is a reason the customer images from this camera are all still photos--those are the only decent ones this Nikon can take.Oh, and forget about shooting indoors. The noise level is ridiculous even after raising the ISO and trying the Party/Indoors setting. The indoors setting is actually worse since it makes all your photos look like watercolor paintings.Additionally, this camera--even on most still subjects--cannot take a sharp picture. Compare the customer pics of this camera to that of the Canon Powershot 1100 and you'll see what I mean. The lines of the subject have a fuzzy look and the colors are bland. You can use the vibrant colors feature but that makes the photos look like still frames from an old technicolor movie. Skin tones are either pale white/grey or orange. The latter is especially true when you are shooting indoors.Also, don't believe Ashton--this camera is larger and slower than the Canon Powershot 1100. I missed many a great photo opportunity waiting for the camera to focus or I shot the pic and got a blurry mess.Oh, and I read the manual cover to cover and am a paid photographer so don't be fooled by reviews that tell you that you'll be fine if you do the reading. These people clearly do not have an eye for quality.My recommendation for sharp photos and natural skin tones is any of the Canon Powershots. Olympus is also a great brand. I just picked up the Powershot 1100 and love it! The pictures are sharp and natural looking when taken on the basic settings. There is even a kids and pets setting, which, for a mom like me is wonderful. Oh, and did I mention that the powershot is cheaper? Do yourself a favor and check out the canons instead.
