{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Two Significant Flaws as a Baby Monitor", "Author": "Books123", "ReviewID": "RBJYG38MZAG09", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Preface:  This is my first ever wireless camera, which I am using as a baby monitor, one of the uses advertised on the product packaging.Color reproduction is extremely poor, even in a well lit room.  I do not expect the video to be as vivid or natural as the photos shown on the product packaging, but the color is very washed out, noticeably worse than any webcam that I have ever seen under similar lighting conditions.Placing the monitor unit anywhere near (i.e., within 3 feet of) my notebook computer completely disrupts the 802.11g wireless network transmission, making wireless networking impossible.Thus, although this product works adequately as a security camera, it is totally unsuitable for use as a baby monitor.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great baby monitor.", "Author": "ghost", "ReviewID": "R2CSZMMPS5KGR7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ignore the previous review, as its comment has no relevance for use as a baby monitor. Yes, the color quality isnt great, but you dont need to see your baby in high def vivid colors, just need to see your baby clearly, day or night, and it does that great. The range is great. The only flaw is the noise sensitivity alarm. The handheld receiver doesnt turn on from sound until your baby is virtually screaming. The sensitivity can be adjusted, but it doesnt help much. It does turn on however, so it is still usefull.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Strange buzzing sound emitted from device", "Author": "JFMama", "ReviewID": "R1VP6YNY38NNMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The video works well in both color and black and white, but the device emits a high-pitched whine that drives my husband and I crazy!  Also, when we run the fan in the baby's room, the camera doesn't pick up the baby's noises until he's being loud enough that we could hear him without the monitor!  So, overall, I would recommend a different model, like Summer Infant.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible Sound", "Author": "heather Darby", "ReviewID": "RGXP1RG2DH4EB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used this monitor last night and will be returning it tomorrow. The sound quality was terrible. It cut in and out. The picture during the day was just fine but was a little fuzzy at night. I would keep looking around if your using this to monitor a baby and want to hear them.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "The product is ok.", "Author": "Adalberto", "ReviewID": "RYIF23OT7S220", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product is ok. Image quality and sound are good for it purpose. In my case the only cont. is that the display has turned gray in several occasion without any explication, being at the same room as the camera. I have turned off, and wait a couple of minuets an when I turned back on, then everything works fine. I have tried to find why it doing this, and I haven't found anything yet.The rest is good.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Capable!", "Author": "Bob Pople", "ReviewID": "R1YI3ZQ9E526HL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a client. They were wanting the ability to pull up onto an alignment rack with just one person. So we place the camera up higher an pointed it at the rack they in turn use the remote viewer to watch the tires and make sure they are on straight. This little gem works like a charm for this. It wound up being the perfect item", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2.4 inch Color LCD display in portable handset\n150 ft. indoor range\nColor by day, camera  auto switches to B&W; under low light for best picture clarity.
