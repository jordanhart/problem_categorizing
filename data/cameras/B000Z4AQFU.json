{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Product Review to help Fellow Online Purchasers", "Author": "LovingChristian", "ReviewID": "R29TBRSMTJRZBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With all the negative comments about this product I wanted to give it a fair chance. I am writing this review because as a fellow online purchaser, product feedback is very important in making your purchase decisions. I almost did not buy this product because of the negative reviews but for $15 I figured it would be worth the risk and now I am glad I bought it. I have made a couple DVDs so far and it has been trial and error but I am getting better each time. This product works and so far is working great. The hardest part is learning to use the software that comes in the package with the Easycap. Just a few steps to get you going... Put the disc in prior to inserting the easy cap. When it autoruns then click on the install driver option. (There are more in depth directions that come with the product but they were in broken English so I'm trying to help with that.) The directions say to tell it not to search the internet then continue on and eventually you will get to a screen that says it has not passed windows logo testing. The directions say to click \"continue anyway\". Once the drivers are installed then plug in the device. Complete the install new hardware wizard and then it will probably show another device which is the sound and it should install itself. After everything is finished, then on the disc menu click install video studio. Install that and you are ready to go. Plug in your other device (VCR, gaming system, camcorder etc.)Start up the program and click on videostudio editor, it will load up and then click on the capture tab. Then click on the video capture button. (Be patient here this might take a little bit to load stuff in but it won't show it loading it also might mute your system while the sound is integrating.) There is a format line. The default is AVI, I believe, but you will want to set it to MPEG for DVDs and also so you don't take up all of your hard drive (since AVI files are about 1 Gigabyte per minute of video one hour of video would take up a huge chunk of your hard drive. I know this because I used up my entire hard drive on a couple of videos :-)  PLEASE NOTE: there is a little gear that says options. Click it then click \"video and audio capture property settings...\" MAKE SURE: that under the source tab the TV system says NTSC instead of the default PAL that comes up. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOU MAY NOT SEE ANYTHING COME UP ON THE SCREEN AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CAPTURE OR BURN VIDEO ONTO DVD. Also under capture tab I clicked the customize button and put 720 X 480 frame size because if you don't when it burns to DVD it will have to convert it anyways. I also put the speed/quality slider bar all the way over to quality because I'm burning family videos and I could care less how long it takes as long as the quality is best. (Adjust this as you see fit). Next step is to click on capture video and when done click stop capture. You will notice the video is displayed in a little square in the top right corner. You can click this and view it.  When you are done recording and ready to make a disc click the share button at the top and add media as you see fit. You can also edit menus and backgrounds later on. Also notice there are tabs at the bottom left that allow you to change the TV ratio (I use 16:9) and tabs for settings. There is much more to be said about the program but I have not used all the features and this is only to help you get going so you can enjoy your product.  I hope this review has been useful and as I said this is a great product for the price. I have had the product for about a week and I have been working on transferring my family videos to DVD and so far it has been great!", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "This product is great!", "Author": "killerviral", "ReviewID": "R1N0G93I0BJIJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is great but not perfect it has better quality then a DAzzle but only after i change some settings in the capture area heres how i did it1. click capture video but don't capture.2. click video type.3. click mpeg.4. click options, then click the 'SECOND' option.5. click capture up in the tabs of the options.6. move the quality meter all the way up to 100%.7. then click advance.8. make the quality DVD then scroll to the bottom then click 720 by 620 NTSC or the PAL option right below it if your in Europe.9. the click display area and make it 16.9 then make the bit rate constant bit rate.10. keep the audio were it is expect if the bit rate is under or above 224kbps then make it 224kbps to remove static.11. now download a media encoder because MPEG isn't compatible with alot of programs.13.

Many of the EasyCAP DC60s being distributed are cheap, poor-quality (and often broken) fakes. I purchased one of these video adapters as a belated birthday present for my son. The item I bought was listed as \"new\", but when he opened the package, he found that the CD that contained the software for the installation and operation of the adapter was a Mitsubishi brand blank disk with said software burned onto it. My son assumed that I had simply bought him a used EasyCAP, that the previous owner had lost the original CD and that he had burned a replacement CD before selling it back. After installing the software and plugging in the video adapter, my son found that his computer did not recognize that any drivers for the device had been installed. After researching drivers and fixes to the problem, my son eventually found the website of Shenzhen Forward Video, the supposed official manufacturer of the EasyCAP DC60+. Shenzhen Forward Video has given a statement ([...]) claiming that someone has been poorly reproducing and distributing EasyCAP products. In addition to that, it appears as though Shenzhen Forward Video never made an EasyCAP DC60 in the first place; the only model listed on their website with \"DC60\" in the name is their DC60+, of which production has been discontinued.I am not the only person to have come to the conclusion that they were sold an imitation. During his search for a solution to the drivers problem, my son found a website ([...]) where someone else who had unwittingly bought two broken EasyCAPs and managed to get his hands on a third, working model posted photos comparing the real thing to the reproductions.If you're looking to buy a video adapter, I would suggest that you stay clear of the \"EasyCAP\" brand altogether because you may not get what you paid for.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT ON XBOX 360", "Author": "Graham D \"DM\"", "ReviewID": "R28NOFSYUAGF3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

"ReviewID": "R1C6NZ1J3LDBS8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hello All:I have a security DVR which gives me direct AVI extracts out of its USB port, but without audio. So my project was to find a way to video capture extracts from the DVR. I bought this EasyCap. Had to make several passes with the WinXP driver install routines until all of EasyCap's drivers installed. Then I installed their video capture software. I was able to get sound but only got fuzz in the video display panel. Then tried Win XPs Movie Maker. Same thing albeit more frustrating. Movie Maker would lock up after each attempt. Next, I went out on a video capture software hunt and tried several other products which had trial downloads. No luck and I was almost at my wits end. My last stop happened to be nchsoftware, who offer the Debut video capture software. And the basic version is free.Unbelieveably, after a little bit of fudging, the video feed from my dvr showed up in the Debut display on my pc. This amazing software lets you record in any of multiple formats: vcd, avi, mp4, etc. There are a couple of quirks, not so huge though. One is that in the 'tools' options to adjust the device I have to keep changing the video input format to NTSC_M each time I launch Debut. Culprit is EasyCap which keeps defaulting to PAL_B. Not sure why PAL_B was chosen as default while marketing to the US. Secondly, while recording I can see the green audio bar moving in the Debut display panel but cannot hear the audio.After I 'stop' the recording session and replay the newly created file from 'recordings' on the menu I have both video and sound in the file.Hope this information will help you too. Saved my day. And I recommend a robust donation to nch software for the free version of Debut. Alternately, buy the Debut Plus to support the company. They have a huge line of other video related products.Hope this info helps you and good luck.AhmedUSA", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth the effort", "Author": "Brian Ferguson \"algermilitia\"", "ReviewID": "R2VKY1EPWA0B3Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item a few months ago because I finally wanted a video capture device to transfer our old home movies to disc, so that we'd have them for much longer than VHS can ever last.

First, my goal was to get a live feed from a camera up on a secondary screen display full-screen (i.e. projector system). I encountered several hurdles along the way, but I did finally figure out how to get it done. First, before letting the device install its drivers, you may want to just stick it in to see if it identifies as OEM Capture like mine did. Then don't install it and just abort and pull it back out. Assuming it is the same as mine was, put in the driver CD and let it autoboot to the menu. Install the driver taking all of the defaults. Then put the device in and let the driver complete its installation. Then you may want to go ahead and install the included Ulead Video Studio SE but note that this software did not work on my Vista laptop. It would run, but I never got an image on it. Instead, download the free VLC Media Player and install that. When I installed it, I unchecked the file associations and the context menu stuff because I did not want it messing with what my media files were associated with. Then I let it complete the installation. Watch out for clone installers that might want to install toolbars and other nonsense. The official download I did, had none of that. Then run the VLC program and click on Media - Open Capture Device. Then click on Advanced Options. Choose OEM Capture for the Video Device Name and put a check in Device Properties. Click on OK and then on Play at the bottom. After a couple of seconds boxes will start to popup where you choose NTSC-M, audio selections (I did not need audio so I did not even experiment with that), and then you can choose Composite Video on the third popup instead of the default S-Video. At that point you should see video from your source. If you drag the window over to your secondary screen and double-click on the image it will go full screen on the secondary display. A lot of other software would only do full screen on the primary display. I have no idea how VLC does with actually capturing files and audio, but it did do what I was going after. The price was fine at $8, but the time investment was unreal at many hours of trying to figure this out. I just hope it helps someone else and that you can share how the recording and audio capabilities are for the devices that register as just OEM Capture.UPDATE: When I finally did get everything connected to the projection system, I found that I had a video delay of nearly one full second, which is not really workable when trying to feed a live shot up onto a screen. It is very disconcerting to hear the sound and then see the lips moving a second later. There may be some instances where the delay would not matter, but if you are trying to do the same thing I was trying to do it may be a lost cause.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "HARDWARE: VERY GOOD; SOFTWARE: ACCEPTABLE", "Author": "GORTIZR", "ReviewID": "R2E4EH3LN31DKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the comments of other users about this device, I finally decided to buy it. To give you a better idea of the impressions I have had with this after several tests, I will analyze it under some categories, where top rate (excellent) is 5.1. THE DEVICE AS ITSELFIt is small, easy to carry out. It includes an USB extension not too long, it is not essential but helps. If you have a laptop, you can take this device with you in your backpack in the same way you carry the laptop accesories.My rating: 5.2. THE SOFTWARE AND USER MANUALSA CD is enclosed, as well as some documents about the installation and setup. When checking the CD I realized why this device is cheap: it is a CD-R, not an original CD. The installation guide is just a piece of paper with text but no pictures describing setup process. The second document is slightly better than previous one, but it is not anything out of this world; it's a kind of quick but not too deep guide about the device, the software, and some troubleshooting guide.My rating: 2.3. SETUP PROCESSI have a laptop with Microsoft Windows Vista, 3 GB in RAM memory and a 500 GB hard disk. According to the piece of paper, I placed the CD in my computer and began the setup as appeared in the 'manual'. I followed all the steps but my setup process was not the same as explained in the paper. When my DVD drive launched the install window, I began with the driver. After that, Ulead Video Studio 10.0 setup. I don't know what was wrong at first, but when running Ulead Video Studio I got a window showing a problem. I reinstalled the driver and everything was fixed.My rating: 4.4. CAPTURING VIDEOSConnecting the device to the computer is very simple. After that, I opened Ulead Video Studio and selected Capture tab. In few seconds the software recognized the source signal and was ready to begin the capture. That's a very easy thing. There are several video formats to work with, my tests were done with these:* AVI: The one with best results, image resolution is very sharp and clear (of course, it depends on the source media conditions). However, it has a big negative point: \u00a1\u00a1each minute captured 'eats' 1 GB of disk space!!* WMV: This format makes files with good size. Probably due to its compression nature I found that image resolution tends to have a kind of distortion, it is not as fine as in AVI format. Anyways, I think it is not so serious.* MPG: The software was unable to capture in this format, no idea why.My rating: For general capture process, 5 (for AVI, 5 in quality and 1 in filesize; for WMV, 4 in quality and 5 in filesize).5. EDITING VIDEOSUlead Video Studio has several tools and features to process the captured videos, it seems to be a very powerful software. However, removing unnecessary parts of videos, for example, is not as simple as when using other video applications (like Microsoft Windows Movie Maker). The program interface is not so clear with some buttons and commands.My rating: 2.FINAL CONCLUSIONSIt is cheap and very easy to install and use. I have had previous experiences with video edition, but I consider this device can be easily used by beginners as well as professional users. After completing capture, I suggest making edition with a different program.Overall rating: 3,6.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "DC60 poor quality", "Author": "Larry Atnip \"Larry A.\"", "ReviewID": "R1S1EL2GO3I03O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It works, but induces a background noise on any video/audio captured.

I was able to get both video and audio working, although I did not use S-video, and some of the software I used didn't preview audio (but still recorded it). My PC is a relatively new AMD Phenom II 6-core, 16 GB RAM, w/a high-end NVIDIA graphics card. Because of video quality and limited compression support with the capture driver, I did end up using lots of hard drive space to capture the initial raw video (roughly a GB per minute). I used a 2 TB external drive (eSata, not USB) which had more than enough room (about 28 hours of video) and down-converted the results (my goal was to get it into DVD format).I read the other posts here, so I installed 64-bit drivers. (Google the names if the link does work or is removed):[...]1. STK1160.zip  32bit DRIVER PACKAGE FOR XP, VISTA AND WINDOWS 7  STK1160 for Philips SAA7113 chipset)2. USB-AVCPTSetup_For_Win7.zip  NEW 64bit DRIVER PACKAGE FOR XP, VISTA AND WINDOWS 7  STK1160 ATV BDA for Philips SAA7113 chipset)  - NOTE! This 64bit driver doesn't support s-video3.EasycapDC60_STK1160Grabber_32&64bit.zip  NEW 32 & 64bit DRIVER PACKAGE FOR XP, VISTA AND WIN7 (STK1160 Grabber for Syntek 8113 chipset which is modified from an original Philips SAA7113 chipset by Syntek Semiconductor)Since I had a 64-bit OS, I tested the last two. The last (newer) one was a bit tricker (failed at first), but worked with a reinstall after reboot. I also used the 64-bit version of USBDeview (google: usbdeview-x64 USBDeview.exe) to cleanly remove the driver (Windows sometimes caches old info after a driver uninstall).The bundled ULead VideoStudio will work with some tweaking, but not right out of the box. I tried three other free products and got better results. Here is a quick summary:1. ULead VideoStudio: searched other reviews on this products for some tips. Was able to get video to work, but it didn't produce the best video (Windows Media Format Plug-in, but only up to 320x240) and the audio wasn't clean. The other formats did not work for me. May have been ok for low-res youtube if it wasn't for the audio issues.2. VLC Media Player: worked somewhat better, and was able to compress in-line, but had horizontal (interlacing?) artifacts. Also cumbersome to use. Uninstalled.3. Virtual Dub (64-bit at source forge): this worked fine, but unable to use compression codecs (more of a driver limitation with the STK1160 hardware). Was also able to preview audio.4. Virtual VCR: about the same results as Virtual Dub. Simplest to use, but unable hear audio during preview (but can see audio waveforms). Audio sounded fine in the resulting file.So as far as capturing (open source/free), Virtual Dub and Virtual VCR worked for me. I stuck w/Virtual VCR b/c of simplicity.As far as authoring a DVD, I could try to struggle on with ULead VideoStudio, but I was put off by its clumsiness. Antiquated software bundled w/fire-sale priced device, so it wasn't a surprise. Since I have Windows 7, here is what I'm using (Windows Live products, free from Microsoft):1. Windows Live Movie Maker (for editing, adding titles/effects for videos, conversion). BTW, Movie Maker sees the capture device but crashes, so I still had to use Virtual VCR to capture the original feed.2. Windows DVD Maker (for final conversion to DVD, DVD menus).Anyway, wanted to put this info out there in case some of the other tips don't work for you. Not saying what I'm doing is any better, but it worked for me.If I ever  need to capture anything newer/better than old VCR tapes, I'll certainly look elsewhere.

Put the disk in but install NOTHING! Plug your Easycap in and allow windows to search for the drivers eventually another screen will pop-up asking for you to use the disk that came with the Easycap select the option for the disk you have in your drive and your all set. The name of your Easycap will show up as Syntek STK1150 on your computer so don't uninstall it by mistake this is your Easycap and it'll show up under this name in the video capture software you use also. Problem number 2: the video editing program they give you on the disk to capture and edit your videos is complete crap don't use it unless you really have no other option I would suggest a program like Nero's Nero Vision or Debut Video Capture Software. I also had to use the webcam option on Debut to capture and change the settings to composite on video input also make sure your audio is setup to record.

I watched numerous youtube videos that explain how to tweak your computer to get the EasyCAP to work but they didn't really help me.I finally got frustrated and gave up on the EasyCAP.About a week later, I saw the Roxio Easy VHS to DVD package on a lightning deal for 19.99 so I scanned the reviews.  There were both a lot of positive and negative reviews.  The negative reviews, though, were mainly about problems loading the software not the audio/video quality.  I decided for $20 (~66% off) I would give it a shot.I should tell you that I'm running a 3 year old laptop with Windows 7 64-bit.  My computer is adequate but far from cutting edge.  The Roxio software and drivers installed quickly for me (in less than 5 minutes) and I am thrilled with the video capture results.The Roxio software has a feature that lets you save directly from the VHS to a DVD in one step.

I'm a WAN Engineer with over 20 years in the computer industry.  I figure I'd let you know that just to give you an idea that there are very few technical issues that can throw me for a loop.  Unfortunatly this one did.  There are a few problems with this version of the device:1] The drivers shipped with the item doesn't work with Windows XP.  Particularly XP Service pack 32] Even when you obtain the drivers you can't follow the typical installation procedure.3] The audio quality of the output is terrible.I have found ways around each issue:I've been able to download the drivers from the web. You should be able to find the drivers if you google the dives drivers.  Just make sure that the copy you use has an inf file.  The other compiled installations do not install properly on XP.  I was able to copy these directions from a blog that worked well for me.  1. Download and extract drivers for Syntek stk1160. Note that it is 1160 we want and NOT 1150. UPDATE (4/17/2009): The original site housing the drivers no longer works so I have uploaded them myself. The driver inside the package says \"1150\" but it is indeed 1160.2. Followed step 5 (and ONLY step 5) of Ashleigh's instructions for editing the oem17 file.  NOTE: do NOT use the files off the CD and do NOT run the setup EXE file from the CD! I did the first time and had to do a System Restore to undo the damage.3. Connect the EasyCap and wait for the \"Install new hardware\" dialogue to pop up.4. Select the option to select the drivers from a list.5. Select \"Imaging device.\" Windows might not agree with you... whatever, you're smarter than it.6. When Windows has given up installing drivers, say you have a disc, then select the folder where you've extracted the stk1160 drivers.7. Windows may not like this, stating the hardware won't be compatible blahblahblah... just install it anyway.8. After it's all happily installed, go to the stk1160 driver folder. There will be a program called \"StkATVAp\" with the icon of a little camcorder. Open it.9. \"Syntek STK1160\" should show up under \"Devices\"... make sure it's selected. Under \"Options,\" make sure both \"Preview\" and \"Audio Preview\" are checked.10. Hook up the EasyCap to your source and start playing a video off of the source (if you're using a camcorder like I am and have speakers hooked up to your computer, put the camcorder in VCR mode and play off a tape... you'll get some annoying feedback from your PC speakers if you attempt to capture live footage/sound).11. Go to \"Video Capture Filter\" under \"Options.\" In the first tab, make sure the correct video standard is selected (for me, this was NTSC_M)... you will know it is correct because \"Signal Detected\" should change from 0 to 1. Then go to the last tab and make sure the left check box is identical to what you've just selected, and select the proper hookup method (for me: Composite video). Click OK.12. I got video/sound at this point. If it's still not working for you, go down to \"Video Capture Filter\" in \"Options\" and make sure you've got the right video standard (NTSC_M for me).To get around the poor audio just feed the audio from your device directly to the line in on your computer.  Most software will allow you to switch your audio input.  This will allow you to import crystal clear audio and video.  I hope this helps.

My T.V. is old, but this worked out at least alright for me. The EasyCAP has 4 cables, 1 yellow video cable, 1 red audio cable, 1 white audio cable, and 1 S-Video cable. This means that you cannot record from an HD T.V. without extra cables. However, my set up is for recording videogame footage, which goes from my console, to a DVD player, then to my T.V.. To use this item, all you do is follow the instructions on the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER. The device also comes with a fold out paper, but that is uneccicary. So follow what the one paper says, and you should be fine. The EasyCAP actually did quite well for me. The video captured on Silent Hill 2 (PS2) looked excellent, however, the audio seems a bit distorted.Long story short, the device (If used properly) can record fairly good video, and is a cheap solution for people on a budget. The audio is a bit distorted, and I'll update this if I find a solution.

Some review(s) here indicated it only works with the included software, but that's not the case.  Notes: For Win64, I followed included directions to download special driver software, first, instead of drivers on CD.  I have left the device connected to source video cable, and no overheating problems.  The included USB extender cable couldn't be any cheaper quality (tiny wire gauge), and that caused some problems...so recommend testing EasyCap without that cable, to avoid headaches...a few bucks on amazon gets you a better extender cable.

I'd like to say I would buy it again, but, I believe that an HD PVR would suit my needs better.

DO NOT install the drivers on the disc as they are completely outdated, instead look up the drivers online, there are many videos online to walk you through this. Second off don't use the included software for recording, I have found that Windows Movie Maker though the webcam option is your best choice.Third DO NOT use the audio connectors on the easycap as they are complete pucky, instead invest in a RCA to 3.5 jack adapter and plug it into your mic port for crystal clear audio. If you have Video Editing software like Sony Vegas, this is a plus because it will allow you fix any motion blur caused by the cheap hardware.Included is a Video with recordings of the easycap after applying optimal settings.

In order to do this DO NOT USE the driver on the disc. Plug in the easycap, let windows scan(this will not find the driver). Go to [...] and Download DriverMax. Allow Drivermax to scan your computer, once the scan is done go to Menu and click identify unknown hardware, this will find the stk 1160 driver and allow you to download and install the lastest driver. I found this works well with virtualdub video editing software. I have also noted, that if your are running virtualization software such as vmware, and virtualbox, the easycap will have issues with driver detecting. I hope this information will take away a great deal of stress with the setup issue.I worked retail for a while, and every once in a while you get a dud unit.

I could not even install the software that came with the CD. It stopped in the middle of installing. I waited for hours but the progress bar still didn't move, I could not even close the window, had to hold the power button so my laptop could be turned off. So I downloaded similar program. Apparently the software that came is version 8, although there are version 11 online. The software could not even detect the device. Crappy and a waste of money and my time trying to find solution online because I thought it's my laptop that has a problem.

(I did not like the autorun feature so I turned it off on my computer; that's why I had to manually start that program.)3. Select to install the driver. Then I did whatever the installation program asked me to do (such as \"plug the device in to a USB port\".) Note that plugging in the device will cause Windows XP to popup a \"Hardware Assistant\" box. Ignore this box till next step.4. When the driver installation program finished, select \"No, not this time\" in the \"Hardware Assistant\" box under the question: \"Can Windows connect to Windows Update to search for software?\". Then select \"Next\". Then select the option \"Install the software automatically\" and click \"Next\". Click \"Finish\" to close this window.At this point the driver was installed. I could fire up my capturing program to capture images from a video source. I my case I hooked up an analog camera to the adapter. It worked on my first try.Next I installed the Ulead VideoStudio program from the autorun main menu. Following the directions to select language (\"English\"), then accept the license agreement. The installation went on smoothly. The only catch was that at a certain point the tool tips of some of the options in the program were in a different language (which I could not read.) I thought that was a bad sign. But I continued the installation and that type of inconvenience did not appear again.After the Ulead VideoStudio was installed I digitized some videos. The process was quite straightforward. I have not tested to write the video to a DVD. The options were there. I will follow up with the result of that operation.The \"Quick Installation Guide\" that came with the product was obviously written by some non-English speakers, but I could get the information out of it with no problem. Overall speaking, the product functioned as advertised, at least for me.July 13, 2011 Follow-up on DVD authorizing: I tried to digitize a VHS tape using a video tape player (Sanyo DA4Head Hi-Fi). I chose to output to DVD. I used the default parameters except that I changed the quality setting to 100 (the highest value allowed). The process finished smoothly, and the created DVD is of very high quality. Other people mentioned that this device overheated during use.

After some internet research, I discovered that the USB connection for audio does not work on all PC's...and in this case a Compaq 700US laptop.  To make the sound usable, you need to use the line-in on the PC (MIC input).  Basically, you need to purchase a phono to RCA adapter like this one:[...]Next, you take your source audio and plug into the adapter and go into the line-in port.  On the software, you need to then select that as your audio source.  The video still uses the USB.Now the image quality isn't the best.  I noticed that fast action was clipped on playback.  Luckily, this was for taking some kids shows off my DVR and making a DVD for a recent trip with my 2-year-old.  She's not that concerned with image quality (yet).The rendering from the captured show took quite a while on my older laptop.  About 2 hours for a 22 min show.

I had to play with it a bit and do some searching on the internet to get this thing to work. Had I simply handed this to my wife and let her install it, she would have sent it back (she is technology proficient, but does not have the desire or the patience to trouble shoot these type of issues).Once I got this thing installed (and we are talking a few hours of trouble shooting on a Saturday morning), it worked fine. The video files are large if you set it to AVI. If you set it to MPEG they get smaller and still look good. My wife has used this since to transfer VHS tapes to the computer and I then edit them and put them on DVD (with Premiere).So, if you have the patience and the know-how regarding how to get this up and running, this will work for you. If you do not, don't bother with this. Spend more money and get something that works out of the box. I gave this three stars because when I got it working, it worked fine.

I honestly didn't expect it to work at all however the picture from my PS2 actually looked better through it then it did using the piggy back cables that I have going to my 19\" HD TV.  It's my belief that it looks better because the PS2 is a standard definition system, and the device captures standard definition.  I noticed no only minor lag in the picture, but it wasn't so much as to make the game \"Super Ghouls and Ghosts\" on the Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 unplayable.I am running Windows 7 64 Bit Home Premium with a 6 core, AMD Phenom II X6 1045 T Processor running at 2.7 Ghz.  I have 6 GB of installed ram, an on board sound card, and some nice Logitech speakers. System is less then 6 months old as a matter of fact.The audio however on the device is 100% failure, as is the included USB extension cable.  In fact the extension cable is toast straight out of the packaging, completely unusable, since no devices I plug into it work, no matter what I plug in, or the USB port used,  however when the same items are plugged into the same ports they work just fine.  The audio on the device is horrendous.While you DO get sound through the device, its sounds like a very badly tuned radio full of static, stuttering sounds artifacts, and worse, if your in a section where there is no music you get a horrendously loud buzzing which gave me a near instant headache from the pitch as oscillation.  There are work arounds to fix this, but it takes purchasing another program, using the line in port on your computer (with a rca to mini 3.5 jack cable), or if you want to do voice over work a external mixer plugged into your line in port, while using a RCA to 3.5 mini cable.  The fact of the matter is that the sound quality is completely unacceptable, and unusable making this product only partly functional.However the product IS functional, and because of the price (I got it for free, normally its 20 dollars but I had credit with Amazon), I will keep it until I can afford better.  Considering I wasn't expecting the product to work at all, I am impressed with its quality, however it is disappointing that the product is only 50% functional.

All computer hardware installs differently depending on your computers operating system, installed software and hardware configuration. Take any reviews on ease of installation with a grain-of-salt because it may take you 10 minutes to get the capture dongle to work correctly or 6 hours. I'm running Windows 7 on a Toshiba Satellite Duo Core Laptop with a realtek sound chip. I couldn't get the sound to work through the USB port (but many reviewers reported Vista & XP will working fine thru the USB)...not sure why except it's probably an incompatility issue with my sound chip and the provided drivers. It all depends on the type of computer you have.  Nevertheless I opted to use a RCA jack splitter and feed the sound outputs from the Dish receiver out-jacks into the stereo microphone input jack on the Laptop. I made a mistake of choosing the microphone setting instead of the CORRECT setting which was LINE IN...that cost me over an hour of anquish trying to figure out why the sound was so garbled.After a couple of hours of experimenting I did manage to get excellent quality video and sound by choosing regular screen format (unchecking the 6:9 box on the ULead software that is included with the USB capture device)and selected MPEG-2 with a 5000 bit sample rate.  This seemed to be a good compromise for video and sound quality without eating up too much of my hard drive space.  The default AVI setting can generate very large files and unless your have a system with tera-bytes of space it's best to consider using a image format that compresses the video thus lowering the picture quality and saving hard drive disk space.  The included Ulead software is a little dated but did work so long as you ignor the error screens and no sound preview while you are recording. I did get sound on playback mode only.I paid [...] for the EasyCap which includes the free 2-day shipping from Amazon and didn't expect miracles but was truely amazed with the great results from such an inexpensive product. If you enjoy tinkering with technology, as I do, then I highly recommend the EasyCap USB 2.0 Audio/Video Capture/Surveillance Dongle...a definite bang-for-the-buck bargain.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "4CH USB DVR", "Author": "Robert A.

However, here is the same instructions broken down into steps if that will make it easier.1) Download the proper drivers to your desktop (depending on your Windows 7 version)2) Plug your EasyCap into your USB port on your PC, it will search for drivers and fail (this is okay and may take a moment)3) Right Click your \"Computer\" icon and click on Properties4)On the Left side of the Properties screen click on Device Manager5) You should see USB Interface Device (or something along those lines with a Yellow Triangle.

The first time I plugged it after installing the drivers and software and messing with some of the settings, I was able to get a full color, decent quality picture of Forza 3 that I was playing on my Xbox 360.  I started recording and when I went to play it back, the video was very choppy and the sound was out of sync.  I tried to record some television and the video still came out kind of choppy and the sound was fuzzy.

[the drivers]for audio problems, you may have to use a rca red/white patch cord adapter with the 3.5mm jack plugged in  from your audio out on the source [the red/white ends] and use the 3.5 plug into your mic/input jack. the sound from there sounds better than using the supplied built in audio driver as it has a humming or buzz sound to the audio. it will also depend on your soundcard but when i use the mic jack the sound records just as you would hear it through the speakers.Hope some will find the info useful?

Used it on XP with a old Pentium III.  Fired right up on ONE channel.  I used a Swann DIY cam.  Not bad.  As good as the cheap DVR PCI cards that I am also experimenting with.  In fact, the video was LESS jerky.  There is a lag in the video.  This night I tried hooking up two cams, this one a 30 LED chinese security cam.  For a long time I was pulling my hair.. didn't think the cam was working, even got a RMA to send it back.  THEN...I hooked it to the original channel, the #2 Channel that everyone says is the only one that works.  So I started scouring the net for forums with the same problem, and for drivers.  Here was my solution:  Each time you add a cam you have to reinitialize the device.  It makes sense, when you think of it.  You have to shut down, pull it out of the USB slot, and start it up again.  That is what worked for me.  Now the Video DOES lag a little bit.. but what do you want for 8 bucks?  This software is BETTER than the software I got on one of the PCI cards.  The lagging video, well I dunno.  The computer I am using is very old..I don't even know what it is.  Hmm.. a PIII I think.  So my verdict is:  It does the job.  With ONE cam it will do you very good.  AND..the price is right.  I give it 4 stars 'cos it does the job, is economical.

The Ulead capture/ video editing software is pretty nice. You can adjust the picture e.g. brightness, etc.Great for regular home movies. You can cut and splice. all that.However, one of the reasons I got this was to transfer some old vhs tapes to dvd, something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I have stuff I taped off TV as long ago as the eighties, for example, most of a BBC?\\PBS drama called \"Private Shultz\" (no, not sargeant shultz - not hogans heroes) that one just can't get in the US apparently. (this tape is really starting to go). Anyway, at the time I was taping I was unaware that VHS tapes degrade over time, how bad, depending on their quality rating. I never paid much attention, so ended up with a random mix with a lot of cheap tapes. Some of them have gotten pretty bad by now.I was surprised that first view of the EasyCap result looked clearer than the tape.Unfortuneately it kept getting a little too dark here and there and I found that had to keep adjusting. I also have some old sci-fi movies I actually bought. $40 plus back then for vhs movies (the rental concept was just starting out). They're starting to get fuzzy etc. too. Trying to copy one of them was much worse. Frequent, pretty much total, blackoutsI read an article about Macrovision copy protection on VHS tapes. They screw up the recorded signal somehow (on purpose). Apparently, a lot of older VCR's circuitry could compensate for the bad signal. Then, the studios or whatever got the government to pass a law that decreed player manufacturers to modify their devices to detect the pulses and screw up the picture. The only trouble is, it often can't tell the difference between a deteriorated recording and a macrovision signal. So I suspect that the circuits in the easyCap have been bent to conform to the anticopy mandate.It's not EasyCap's fault, but, a bit disappointing. Hence 4 stars out of 5.Still, you can't hardly go wrong for the price. A lot of bang for the buck.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "DONT GET IT!", "Author": "James M.

I re-booted, re-installed, took out the USB extender and plugged it in directly, all to no avail.Then I tried this on my Mac, using the open source driver (google it). Everything worked immediately, except there was no sound. Turns out there has been an update to this product, and the new sound HW is not recognized by Macs. Boo!Perhaps you'll get lucky with the drivers, perhaps not. As I said, you get what you pay for. Unless you want to take the risk of the driver install game of roulette, spend a bit more and get something from a reputable manufacturer.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Video works, audio does not", "Author": "Ralph Stamerjohn", "ReviewID": "R172FIXMAYCBWO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to move my VHS tapes to disk.I got video to work out of the box on my Windows 7 system (I think update the drivers, its been 6 weeks).

I am running Vista at 32 bit so that was not a problem. But when I change to MPEG, like suggested to get best quality, it does not see the capture device and gives me a message to the effect of that it does not recognize the input/source, or something like that. Moreover, I was not able to see the quality slider, which was mentioned to be set to FULL quality.Another problem is that I captured some clips and I can see them on top right as video icons. I can even click on them and play them in the main window. But when I try to drag them down to my project timeline, it says the content of this file is unreadable, even though it was captured using this device.

So when I saw this EasyCap USB video capture device for such a rock bottom price of less than $8, I thought why not? Maybe it was so cheap because of how electronic devices always fall in price the longer they are sold.  No...the reason for the cheap price is that this was a worthless piece of garbage.  The audio was horrible & scratchy and when I got on the net & Youtube to figure out a way to fix it, I found that lots of people all have the same complaints about it.  Many also say that unit stopped working only after a couple of uses.  Another lesson learned of \"You get what you pay for\".  I chucking this EasyCap into the garbage can and just order another EZ Grabber.  You can tell it was a bad experience right off the bat.  the EZ Grabber came with virtually no instructions.

In other words, the video captured fine, but the audio did not. So, unless you're attempting to capture footage without audio, you can see how this might be problematic. I spent roughly 5 hours searching forums, reinstalling drivers, trying this and that, and never resolved the audio problem.

So I played with eveery setting possible to pritty much get the same ressult so I used Adobe Premiere to capture thinking that the cheap tag on software was crapply codded well the same result came about when adobe captured the footage except this time there was audio but the footage was like watching a bad tv signal for tv channels that you could order back in the day.

So my project was to find a way to video capture extracts from the DVR. I bought this EasyCap. Had to make several passes with the WinXP driver install routines until all of EasyCap's drivers installed. Then I installed their video capture software. I was able to get sound but only got fuzz in the video display panel. Then tried Win XPs Movie Maker. Same thing albeit more frustrating. Movie Maker would lock up after each attempt. Next, I went out on a video capture software hunt and tried several other products which had trial downloads. No luck and I was almost at my wits end. My last stop happened to be nchsoftware, who offer the Debut video capture software. And the basic version is free.Unbelieveably, after a little bit of fudging, the video feed from my dvr showed up in the Debut display on my pc. This amazing software lets you record in any of multiple formats: vcd, avi, mp4, etc. There are a couple of quirks, not so huge though. One is that in the 'tools' options to adjust the device I have to keep changing the video input format to NTSC_M each time I launch Debut. Culprit is EasyCap which keeps defaulting to PAL_B. Not sure why PAL_B was chosen as default while marketing to the US. Secondly, while recording I can see the green audio bar moving in the Debut display panel but cannot hear the audio.After I 'stop' the recording session and replay the newly created file from 'recordings' on the menu I have both video and sound in the file.Hope this information will help you too. Saved my day. And I recommend a robust donation to nch software for the free version of Debut. Alternately, buy the Debut Plus to support the company. They have a huge line of other video related products.Hope this info helps you and good luck.AhmedUSA", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth it even for the software", "Author": "M.
