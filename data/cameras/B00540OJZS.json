{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good quality and features for a fair price", "Author": "A1 Computer Consulting \"a1computerconsulting.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3VP1YRS36ZWYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has more features and options & is easier to set up than one of their four-year-old models.  Its maximum video recording size and resolution is twice as large as most of their less expensive models.  And its iPhone and iPad App is also easier to learn and use than their older App.  But it doesn't have an HDMI port, unlike some of their less expensive models.  And its maximum monitor resolution of 1280x1024 is less than the 1080p monitor we connected it to.  So for its price it should have these features.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "UPC: 645439232839\nWeight: 8.000 lbs", "Name": "Q-See 1TB 16CH DVR System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21eLqYi1dGL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00540OJZS"}}
