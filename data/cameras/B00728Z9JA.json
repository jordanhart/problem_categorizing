Very usable low-light no-flash with Auto, and even better if you use the \"Scene\" mode called \"Hi-Sensitivity\" set at 3mp... where you can get speeds set by the camera according to conditions - speeds from ISO 2000 all the way to 6400!! Sure, some other cameras will push ISO (also at lower mp's ), but usually only with a single jump from 1600 to 3200, with no stops in between, and nothing above 3200! Granted, these high ISO pics will be grainy, but so were the old film cameras with pushed ISO. You will have a photo when no one else could get their under-$200 camera to capture any picture at all !  Very good outdoor video, and better than most indoor video, with no hiss.  Very good zoom - better than any other camera in its price range by a lot - very smooth and with no clicking recorded into the audio.CONS:-  Flash underpowered. UPDATE 10-21-12 : This lil cam has a feature not found on many cameras at 2 or 3 times its price: It can use the +/- exposure (on the top of the rear control ring) to make flash pics brighter and dimmer. It will change the ISO being used with the flash, even in Auto mode. You can therefore control the \"output\" brightness when using flash. I don't know of any other cam near this price that can do this, plus push iso to 6400 in special non-flash situations. What a combination !! A great camera for art and natural history museums.  - The SZ7 has no A,S,or M settings for manual control. (Get the Lumix ZS15 or Canon SX260.)  - Overall picture quality is nice in Auto, and better when you learn the +/- and ISO properly. But the output is not for 8x10 or larger. This can be said for every cam in the price range, but I just want you to hear it from a real admirer of the SZ7 for what this camera CAN do.SUMMARY: Best camera out there at this price and this slim....4.1 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good pictures and movies, convenient size and easy to use.", "Author": "D.

The 10x zoom works well in both still and movie mode.  Unlike other cameras I have used I hear no noise from the zoom mechanism in the movie audio during the replay.  Auto focus and image stabilization work well.  Previously I used the physically larger DMC-ZS7 camera which included an internal GPS to record position coordinates with the picture.  I never used the GPS tagging.  The smaller size of the newer SZ7 is far more convenient for me.I was disappointed that Panasonic chose to not include a separate battery charger with the SZ7.  Instead, the charger is built into the camera with power supplied by a USB cable.  I did some digging and found that other Lumix cameras use the same battery as the SZ7, model DMW-BCK7.  Those cameras list Panasonic battery charger model DE-A91BA as an accessory.  This charger plugs into an AC wall outlet and has a receptacle that holds the battery being charged.  I ordered one of these from Amazon and it charged the SZ7's battery.  I can now continue to use the camera with a second battery while the other battery is in the DE-A91BA charger.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Leica lens, MOS sensor, & affordable - what's not to like?", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "RL7GKML62D2K3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my sixth Panasonic Lumix, I like to upgrade now and then and when I saw Panasonic came out with an affordable MOS sensor camera I had to have it. OK, it doesn't have full manual control like other Lumix cameras I've owned, but I rarely used the manual settings other than Aperture Priority to get a blurred background. Intelligent Auto (iA) is normally where I leave the setting anyhow.Features of this camera I love:-- WOW! Fastest camera I've ever owned, not only on start-up, but SUPER fast shutter response, and fast recycling to take the next photo.-- Leica lens, one of the best lens manufacturers.-- You can optically zoom during the video.-- The size is not TOO small, yet not too big - JUST RIGHT! This is a small camera, but not what I consider to be an ultra-compact where there is NO place to grab onto, those tiny ultra-compact cameras are too easy to drop! This SZ7 is the perfect size.-- Metal body - although it feels like plastic, I read on another site that it's aluminum, good build quality.-- Fantastic photos, HD videos in stereo!-- Pretty decent in low light settings.-- Miniature Effect: I find I use this quite a lot for a blurred background.-- Panoramic feature is the best I've used.Features I'm not crazy about but I can learn to live with:-- Black is the only color choice here, I'm tired of black cameras.-- A mode dial on top would have been nice, instead of menus, at least there is a separate movie button on top.-- No separate battery charger, this is the first Panasonic camera I've owned where the battery is charged inside the camera, it must be a cost-cutting measure for Panasonic.I recommend getting a Class 10 SDHC card if you're using your camera for videos, the quality is better and they cost only a couple dollars more than a Class 4 or Class 6 card.My recommended Class 10 Card: Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10EMy recommended semi-hard camera case: Lowepro Volta 20 Camera Case (Black)I've used this case for many of my cameras, there isn't much padding but the semi-hard exterior makes up for less padding.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Point and Shoot for quick capture moments.", "Author": "Robert Hansen", "ReviewID": "R2ICX9YS3QHWFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really don't understand some of these reviewers.  They buy a nice little point and shoot digital camera and expect it to have the features of a five thousand dollar SLR and high end video all in one.  This camera is inexpensive, compact, and produces great pictures indoors without a flash.  It also compensates for uneven lighting.  I used it outdoors to take pictures of Christmas decorations -- it was perfect.  I used it indoors to take pictures of gatherings of long-lost relatives.  It was perfect with or without a flash.  Macro was perfect and zoom was perfect.  Sure you can't take 300 pictures without a battery recharge and you can't zoom in on something miles away.  Maybe you can't make a huge poster from a picture of a bumblebee taken from ten feet away.  But there is really no shutter lag and the pictures really look good.  This camera doesn't pretend to be something it's not and people who want it to be something it's not have their head in the sand.  It's a nice little camera perfect for those quick capture moments that are so often missed because you're busy with all the dials on your fancy Mount Olympus whatever superzoom SLRs.  There is a battery indicator so you know up front when you need to recharge AND there is only one cord for downloading pictures and recharging right in the camera.  If you want a spare charger and battery it's available as well.  Granted, if you want to use this camera during a category five hurricane outdoors to film your opus, it will probably not do the job.  For those who complain about the detailed users manual only being available on line -- I don't use all of those fancy features anyway and the users manual included in the box had enough info for me.  Bottom line:  I like it!", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic SZ-7 Super Compact Digital Camera", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R1I384QDCZCNC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Panasonic SZ-7 Super Compact Digital CameraThe new for 2012 Panasonic SZ-7 (SZ for 'Stylish Zoom') is a difficult camera to neatly quantify. It is one of the reasons that assigning stars to a digital camera doesn't always make sense. Contingent on your own personal needs, the same camera could be a five-star or a zero-star camera. It all depends on what final form your pictures have and what shooting conditions you anticipate.It takes very little resolution for perfectly pleasing web-based pictures. Although \"snapshots\" are often a backhanded way of trying to discredit a camera, for many people a photo album of memories, just snapshots, are often as far as it goes. It is as far as it often needs to, as you can only put so many framed 8 x 10s on the wall.To try to make this a rational review, I'm comparing the 2012 SZ-7 to the 2010 Panasonic ZR-3. Both are diminutive in size and weight, not as wide as a deck of playing cards and slightly longer. The typical shot to shot time of the ZR-3 is 2.1 seconds, considered better than average in 2010. By comparison, the SZ-7 is a little rocket, with .7 seconds shot to shot. Is the SZ-7 a substantial upgrade from the two years old model? It is and it isn't.The ZR-3 is slightly thicker and uses a more substantial battery. While the ZR-3 was rated for 320 shots, the smaller battery of the SZ-7 allows for about 220. While the ZR-3 has a 230,000 pixel LCD, the SZ-7 sports double the resolution at 460,000. Yet, the old LCD has far better viewing angles, the twisted nematic type of the SZ-7 has more dots, but vanishes when looking at it from an angle. The hinged access door to connection ports on the side of the ZR-3 is now secured by a couple plasticy pieces, with unknown durability. I didn't break the little door off, but it still seems flimsy and fragile. Whether it really is or not, time will tell. The ZR-3 has a familiar mode wheel on the top of the camera, while this SZ-7 uses a button on the back of the camera to access different modes.This is a matter of personal preference. I find an external mode wheel intuitive, with no looking necessary, but it can be inadvertently bumped on removal from a case or pocket where the mode button is not as vulnerable. Additionally, while the ZS-3 has a fast stand-alone charger, the SZ-7 features the new trend of in-camera charging, taking the camera out of commission or necessitating the purchase of an additional product. With the poor viewing angle screen and the reduction on battery life, all of this might sound like an advance to the rear and a \"two star\" type of camera. But that doesn't adequately tell the tale.On the plus side, the SZ-7 has far better shooting performance, a better (10x) optical zoom, better video capabilities, stereo mics, better burst modes, hand-held night scene, HDR mode, 3D, and a Panorama mode. It is a faster camera with better image quality, image quality that is most obvious in low light. While the image quality is very good for this size and price of camera with a successful backside illuminated MOS sensor, a reduction in megapixels resulting in less densely packed sensor likely would have offered a notch better output. Overall, the SZ-7 despite the caveats mentioned is a more powerful, more fully-featured camera than the ZR-3 at what currently is an entry-level price point of $129.99. Camera prices tend to fluctuate wildly, so what this $179.99 MSRP unit will sell for in the future is anyone's guess.Pocket-sized is a vague term, as pockets come in all sorts of sizes. For a small and light camera (less than an inch thick, under 1/3 lb.) it is the sort of digital camera you can carry with you without feeling like you are carrying much of anything at all. Light in weight, light in price, and with very fast shooting performance if you want no excess bulk at all, this camera is very appealing. For snapshots to 8 x 10s under most conditions, along with surprisingly good video, it is easy to say that this camera is recommended and quite worthy of your consideration. It is fast, very very small, light, has a great \"dummy\" (iA) mode, and is easy on the wallet as well.For an extra thirty-five or forty dollars, there are longer-zoom options with manual controls, such as the Panasonic ZS-15, in bulkier but still compact frame sizes. As always, only the individual can scale the benefit of features and zoom against bulk and cost, based on their own unique needs. It is always nice to have choices and this is a very viable one.If you don't mind more a bit more bulk, the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 12.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom (Black) is a more powerful package with better image quality. It has been as low as $160 or so. If bulk doesn't bother you to a point, the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 7.5x Intelligent zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black nets a clear notch up in both still image and video quality, with the lesser zoom the only thing that might cramp your creative juices.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yes, but no.", "Author": "dj", "ReviewID": "RLWFXG9DVD0M2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In my search for a pocket camera, I so wanted this to be \"the one.\"  Unfortunately, it was not.  There is so much good in this camera.  I love the feel and heft of it, the set-up of the controls (you don't have to search around for the on/off button or the view button), and the ease of use.  There is a good selection of scene options, including \"glass through\" which I have not encountered in point-and-shoots of other brands, including Nikon, Canon and Sony.  The video is satisfyingly clear, but the sound is less so.  There are many special effects and features offered.  However, I found that details of photos did not stand up to close scrutiny.  On zooming in, they fall apart and become fuzzy very quickly.  This became the deciding factor as I want to be able to print photos in larger sizes.  In the end, as much as I love this camera in so many ways, I returned it in favor of a Sony Cybershot DSC-WX50 which has only a 5X zoom and less creative options, but takes an excellent still.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Are you a mom?

I have a Canon SLR, and I understand that given the difference in the sensors the SLR must in some respects take better pictures, but I find the pictures from this little camera to be richer. I attribute it to the Leica lens -- I used to have a Leica, and no other camera came close.  I guess this is considered a compact, point-and-shoot camera, but it is not in that realm when it comes to picture quality.  I also like the size and controls. It is very light and compact, and the menu is very easy to use. I don't care about all the bells and whistles, the GPS and what-not of more expensive cameras; if you do, then you might find the controls here a little spare.The one negative I have found so far is the flash.

It supports full HD resolution (but you can use lower resolution as well), you can zoom while taking video, and it has stereo mics. I found the mics to be excellent quality, they're very sensitive and pick up smallest sounds in a quite room - I could hear noises from outside and even myself breathing. It also works great for loud conditions, I recorded at loud rock concerts and audio sounds great with no distortion. In fact, a friend of mine was also making a video at a concert with a ZS5 (which is a more advanced but older camera), and mine came out brighter and better sounding.For taking photos, I really appreciate the \"Min Shutter Speed\" setting that most cameras in this class lack. In low-light conditions, the camera would use 1/8 shutter speed, and I was getting a lot of motion blur when taking pictures at concerts. When I set shutter to 1/30, problem solved.I was choosing between this camera and ZS20/ZS19 which is better, but chose this one because of its size and weight. Having a pocket-sized camera is important to me.I also really like that the battery charges inside the camera.

Aston", "ReviewID": "R3A22JRX2VZQJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had already done extensive shopping and decided to buy a xxxxx camera when we discovered the SZ7.  As we compared them in the store we were surprised by the faster speed and accuracy of the auto focus on the SZ7.  We compared it to every high end point and shoot camera in the store and of that group it was the fastest and also less expensive.  We were so impressed that we bought it on the spot and haven't regretted it.I like the SZ7 because I do a lot of close up pictures for instruction manuals for our business.  The SZ7 has a wide angle lens and the ability to focus quickly in less than optimal light.  Colors are more natural even under artificial and poor light. Part of this is because the camera has a wide angle lens. Part of it is due to the improved camera technology of the last few years.  The SZ7 has many light and picture options and can choose a setting for you automatically if you want.  In the past I have had to do a lot of touch up to make the pictures usable.  I can now get the difficult shot I want with less attempts than it took with my other cameras.  I haven't had to touch up or correct the color on any of the pictures I have taken so far with this camera.In bright sunlight the camera does well with automatically back lighting the pictures.  I got some great water shots and shots from daylight into dark that surprised me.  My wife says that she wishes she would have seen this camera before she bought her more expensive and bigger camera a few months ago.This camera is ready to take a picture faster than the other cameras I compared it to. The lens comes out quickly and the focus is so fast that I don't feel like I am waiting for the camera.  This camera is surprisingly small for the size of screen and the 10X zoom.  The 10x optical zoom blends well with the 2x digital zoom and the pictures are so clear I would not guess that the 20x zoom pictures are half digital.No camera is perfect.  I wish they had put one of their bigger batteries in it.  The battery life is less if you leave all of the features active.  I bought two extra batteries and an external charger here on Amazon which have been needed.  I wish it had a manual focus for night videos. It would also be nice to be able to take time exposures.  Most of the other point and shoot cameras don't have these missing options either but it is something I would have liked.I would buy the camera again.

Good for those of you trying to take photos of children and pets.One feature most forget to mention is the in-camera HDR which is only available deep down in the iA (Intelligent Auto) mode menu. (It took me awhile to find it). HDR means it takes 3 successive images and combines them into one photo - for instance on a landscape shot with clouds, the clouds will be more highly defined as well as the landscape in areas where it needs contrast.

I was not looking for DSLR quality, I just wanted a camera that was simple to operate (very important for the wife) and took quick, quality pictures.  Our current Sony camera took good pictures but the lens would randomly freeze up and we kept missing shots; so it was important to get something that works when I want it to.These are the things that were important for me:  Quick picture taking, with or without flash  Quick turn on to first picture  Something that consistently works  Quality pictures  Good optical zoom (beyond 5x)  User friendly  MOS/CMOS sensorI have a 2 year old and I was looking for a camera that I could grab quick, turn on and take a picture before I lost the shot.  We have had this camera for about a month now and taken pictures inside and outside.  I have no complaints at all about it, it is doing everything I ask of it.  The pictures have been great, this camera meets every criteria above.Random pro's:  The having a separate record button to push to record video - it really is a simple way to catch video.  The camera feels substantial/is a quality build.  Simply put it doesn't feel cheap, I notice that every time I use it.  Simple stuff like you can't disable the digital zoom; but the zoom stops at 10X before it goes into digital - so you don't need  to have it disabled, you know if you are about it use it.  That may be common, but I thought it was a nice touch.Only con's:  The buttons on the back are not centered in the holes (not a big deal, they work fine; just something I noticed).  Zoom - you have to be very steady to take a picture at 10X.  I would expect that out of any camera this  size; this isn't a knock on this camera, just something to keep in mind for any high zoom pocket camera.

It has almost all the features of the higher priced models plus the next generation MOS technology which is super fast and so allows for a lot of sophisticated enhancements to your shots which are largely handled behind the scenes.I was glad to see the addition of the panoramic scan option ....even tho it is clunky and not very well executed. I also miss the aerial setting for shooting out the window of an airliner. But otherwise the options and settings are pretty broad and comprehensive and of course the Ia intelligent auto setting is just great for those of us who don't care to fuss with F stops and all that stuff to get a decent photo.One of the biggest pluses is the form factor or size. It is roughly the size of a deck of cards...and only slightly larger with the case. It fits easily in any pocket without making a bulge. That makes it very easy to carry anywhere, anytime...a huge advantage as far as I'm concerned. I also find that it is so small, light and automated that I can easily shoot with it in one hand if I need to - like while driving or something. The size is nearly perfect...small enough to carry in any pocket and yet not so small that the controls are hard to use and the view-screen is still big enough to let you see what you are doing. It is also sturdy. I accidentally dropped mine about 3' to the ground after taking a shot and there was no harm done.Probably the biggest negative so far is the battery. Mine ran down after only about 90 photos...altho granted I was also doing a lot of exploring of the menus and a number of flash shots. That's not horrible in itself....except that it really does take nearly 3 hours as they spec it to recharge the battery...and it has to be in the camera. Who has 3 hours to wait for a recharge if you're on vacation or whatever? Clearly any serious users will need to buy some replacement batteries and probably also a stand alone recharger. They are available and reasonably priced but the batteries are coded and the camera will not accept cheap imitations so be careful to get only certified compatible products.All that said, I don't see anything else around that's even close to offering the bang for the buck of this camera and so far I'm very pleased with mine!", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unimpressed", "Author": "Adam Caron", "ReviewID": "R12WRGNQ1M6FEY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this to replace an aging Dimage X60. The main reason for upgrading was wanting something that would autofocus faster since I primarily take pictures of animals and a faster shot-to-shot speed. A longer reach would be a bonus too. The SZ7 promised 10x zoom, 1/10 of a second \"Light-speed Auto Focus\" and 10 frames per second.Overall, I'm underwhelmed. I haven't had the camera too long; maybe it'll grow on me more. Here we go.Pros:  Small size: Only marginally larger than my dimage despite a much larger zoom.  Zoom: 10x in a tiny camera is a very usable range. Really, much longer than 10x handheld is  fairly unrealistic, and who really uses a tripod on a point and shoot? The wide angle is very nice too.  Video quality: I don't do much video recording, but I tried it out and it works well. I do notice that it doesn't adjust exposure when zooming but it does focus ok. I have a dedicated camcorder anyway, but it's still a nice feature to have.  Startup: despite having to zoom out the lens, it starts up fast and is ready to go right away. The Dimage claimed .5 second startup, but it was never really ready to fire at 1/2 a second. This one is a little slower, but by no means sluggish.  Build quality: solid and rugged.  High ISO: surprisingly good. Pictures are usable even in less than ideal lighting. Doesn't work miracles, but considerably less noisy than my Dimage was.  Battery life: quite good. Even with the flash going hard the battery holds up well. My dimage had piss-poor battery life.  Zoom speed: smooth, fast, and quiet.  Image Quality: decent. Not excellent, but not as bad as some reviews make it out to be even at full 10x zoom. No, it isn't a DSLR, but the photos are very usable by P&S; standards. I'm not looking to pixel-peep or print posters with this camera.Neutral:  Ergonomics: the button configuration and layout takes a little getting used to. There are no less than 3 different buttons labeled \"MENU\" on the back. The Record/Play button is an odd design choice. I do like the dedicated movie button though.  Battery: not a fan of in-camera charging, but an external charger is cheap to add (aftermarket anyway) so I won't knock points for it.Cons:  Autofocus: this is the biggest disappointment. The \"lightspeed AF\" is anything but. In full, broad daylight it is very fast but indoors, even under pretty good lighting, it is sluggish. Occasionally, I logged over 2 seconds to acquire focus on a few shots, and that is with an AF Assist Light! Most averaged near 1 second. Without an assist light, my 8 year old Dimage did virtually as well. Again, outdoors I am able to focus in about 1/4 second and would certainly be happy with that if it was the rule, rather than the exception. I understand that in \"low lighting\" every camera is going to focus slower but this isn't darkness. It's a living room, with average indoor lighting. The difference is profound.  \"Intelligent Auto\": here is the second biggest disappointment. The \"Intelligent Auto\" is anything but. Again, I primarily photograph animals and decided to leave it on IA to test it first. Consistently it tried to set a shutter speed way too slow to prevent subject movement. No problem, it has a an option for pets. Perfect! Except, not. I selected \"Pet\" and it still tried to set a shutter speed in some shots as slow as 1/8 of a second. 1/8. Seriously? What is this for, a pet turtle? Supposedly the Intelligent Auto was nearly psychic in it's ability to gauge things. If I was trying to take photos in pitch darkness that would have otherwise been impossible I would understand, except I wasn't because I was able to get decent photos by:  I ended up finally setting it to \"Normal\" which allows me to set a minimum shutter speed (1/60 works well). It also allows me to set the ISO if I choose, though the auto works well as does auto white balance. Just by setting the minimum shutter speed I was able to get decent shots even in poor lighting. The camera appears to try to slow the shutter speed rather than ramp up the ISO even though it does fairly well at higher ISOs. A clear but slightly noisy photo is far more useful than a clean, blurry one. It's unfortunate I can't set the ISO or minimum shutter under Auto. I guess I should have picked one of the ZS models with P,S,A,M options, but I already have a Sony DSLR and this camera will be used by my wife as much as me and she is going to expect to just \"Point and Shoot\" with it, as the saying goes.  Image stabilization: surprisingly poor, even at relatively short zoom ranges. At first I thought it was just a factor of the 10x zoom instead of the 3x of the Dimage I was used to, but even pulling back I had to try very hard to hold the camera steady (this was even after upping the shutter speed as mentioned above.) It took me a few shots to even realize it was my shakiness to blame (and I admit that I am shaky) - I finally sat the camera on a box to steady it and voila. I never had this problem with the Dimage which, to the best of my knowledge, had absolutely no image stabilization of any kind. My DSLR has no issues with shooting handheld either, but I don't expect this $130 camera to have the same level of stabilization as that.  Speed: the last disappointment is with the shot-to-shot performance. The advertised \"10 FPS\" does work but the poor ergonomics make it inconvenient to switch to and the 4-shot limit before the buffer is full means you can't really take 10 frames in a second. Or even 5 frames in half-a-second. This means that you have to have a really good guess at the exact moment you need to take the shot. Which kind of defeats the purpose of the fast burst mode. The flash-burst is somewhat useful, though it needs to badly underpower the flash in order to maintain it. Flash recharge speed after a full blast is painfully slow. Without flash and without the burst mode, shot-to-shot speed is good, but nothing to write home about. The burst mode would have been a lot more useful with a dial to select it quickly and easily when desired.Overall, I'm not terribly impressed, though I should state that for the price point that the camera is at, it does pack a lot of features into a small, easy to carry package. I also wouldn't go as far as to say I wouldn't recommend it - for the price, I can't say that I know of a better alternative. Just that I expected a little more based on the reviews. I did find it surprising that the picture quality, which seemed to be the biggest overall complaint, I didn't really find that bad. There was just so many other items that didn't quite live up to their promises.Update: I've used the camera for about a year now and pretty much everything still stands as my original review stated. I use it when size/convenience is important but stick to my 3 year old DSLR whenever they aren't.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R35QYHSVB6ERW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been searching for a new Point and Shoot after my little Kodak stopped working. The Panasonic brand wasn't even one I was considering until a FB friend told me about the Lumix line of cams. I was stunned to find out that most of all the Panasonic Lumix line got ratings of 4-stars or higher. I took a gamble and went for it. I'm glad I did!SUPER FAST! Locks in focus very quickly and takes the shot you want before you miss it. I mostly take pics of dogs, and this catches them in action. It does, however, take longer to focus when zoomed all the way out.My work has just bought a new Nikon 3300 and I compared it with my Lumix SZ7.The Nikon - It took more crisp clear pictures compared to Panasonic, BUT that was only when it took the longest time to focus. Even then, it was hard to get it to focus on the subject you wanted. I tried the Nikon indoors in very poor lighting and you get a very poor picture even with flash. When it uses the flash the recycle time is way too long.The Panasonic - FAST, FAST, FAST! Very Nice indoors pictures, especially if you're closer to your subject and the flash has a chance to light it up. Indoors in poor lighting it still performed very well! Slight blurring if the subject is fast moving, but the flash recycles very fast. This little cam is packed with lots of stuff.

I was going to go back to Canon because I've always had luck with their products but the Lumix series came highly recommended by photographers I trusted.I found this camera with pretty much every feature I wanted for an incredible price, so I went ahead and bought it. I've had it for about a month and have been using it in a variety of situations. The best summary I can offer is that it's really good FOR ITS PRICE. In a broader context, what this camera does for less than $180 is actually pretty incredible considering where the technology was 5+ years ago. It's also amazingly compact and light.The result is that this camera will be more than adequate for the average photographer. Whatever it lacks in resolution or contrast or color can be mostly corrected in editing on your computer- which you should really be doing anyway if you claim to care about photo quality. So pretty good camera but especially good considering the price.That said, here is a list of potential deal breakers for photographers:- Autofocus pretty much sucks. It has 4 or 5 different modes and the manual does not clearly define the differences. It can take a few seconds to get the camera to figure out what you want to focus on in certain situations.- Macro is garbage on this camera. It has 2 macro modes and neither will focus on anything less than 6 inches or so from the lens. That may be a physical limitation of the camera itself, but my old Canon could do macro shots at that distance quite well.- Panorama mode is garbage. With about 20 or so attempts, I've only successfully taken 1 panoramic shot. It's done in a single, sweeping motion but if you go too fast or if the camera thinks you're not steady enough, it aborts the photo.- No aperture priority mode [that I can find]. Not a big deal, but the first camera I've had that lacks this feature.Those gripes aside, I can't say I regret my purchase because the price was so darn low.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as good as my old camera.

The images don't match the Canon S110 or the Sony RX100 which have much larger sensors but this camera comes surprisingly close. The images came out sharp and quite detailed in very good lighting. The camera captures images with very little lag so it's much faster than you would expect. It's an extremely thin camera so it can be easily carried in a tiny case or your shirt pocket but the small size means it's harder to hold than a larger camera. The images show fine detail and the color balance is quite good especially in good light. I tried the camera in low light and was surprised how nice the images came out. The flash isn't extremely powerful but enough for fill flash and night scenes up to 10 feet away.The AVCHD video is also excellent and the sound quality was quite good. I tested the camera against several much more expensive digital cameras. The images from the larger sensor cameras with much better lenses were obviously better but not by a huge amount. It was hard to tell which camera had taken some of the images. So what is the difference in this camera? This camera is essentially a high quality entry level camera with very few buttons, and very few custom settings. This makes it a perfect camera for a novice photographer who doesn't want a lot complexity. There is just enough scene settings to cover most situations. Most users will leave the camera on IA but you will need to switch camera modes to get into scene settings.The only real downside to this camera other than small size is the small battery which did not last very long. It's a good idea to buy a backup battery.  I have a least one backup battery for each camera should I run out, a backup is available. I bought this camera knowing my wife if she traveled would want a very light weight, easy to use camera that took excellent images and video. The top smartphones of today will take decent images and video but they won't match this camera for quality or easy of image capture. The major problem with all top quality smartphones and small digital cameras: they are hard to hold and keep steady. That is one of the major reasons dSLR's and larger super zooms are still very popular cameras. They are much easier to hold and get a steady high quality image or video. The ability to hold a camera comfortably and steady is very important and should be an important consideration when purchasing any camera.If you want lot's of buttons, lots of customization, raw images, this is the wrong camera for you. If you want a light weight, very easy to use camera that costs less than $250.....(I paid $150 when offered on sale, so watch for low pricing), than you can't go wrong with this model.

I've been searching for a good compact that does both relatively well at a decent price. The SZ7 almost fits the bill as it offers good AVCHD video. For video I use the Vivid color mode as the sharpness is boosted and colors are saturated. The zoom works well in video although there is some lens noise that is picked up in the audio at certain points in the zoom range, but it's minor. The downside to this camera is the still pic quality. Many reviews have commented about this. There's a pcmag review that states 1800 lines per picture height, calculated using a center-weighted average, is required for a pic to be considered sharp. The SZ7 scored a mere 1563 lines. But I still decided to give it a shot. After reviewing some initial pics, I was ready to send it back, but, I decided to keep experimenting. The pics are generally soft and get softer in most cases toward the outside edges. I found the IA mode fairly useless. It sometimes does a good job in making decisions in low light though. Instead I tried to find the best settings to boost sharpness as I didn't want to always have to resort to post processing. In normal mode, the Vivid color setting adds a good amount of sharpness, I'm using it frequently, but sometimes colors are too saturated for stills. Too bad they simply don't provide a setting to use the sharpness part of Vivid without the color boost. I'm also using the landscape scene mode as it seems to add a tiny bit of sharpness and it may help with keeping a deeper field of view in focus. Finally, the i.Resolution setting (which is on in most scene modes) seems to help a bit in the normal mode, although, you'll find opinions that it's hit or miss how well it helps with sharpness throughout the pic. To sum up, I'm keeping it even with the so-so still pic quality. For the money (although I see its price has just jumped quite a bit since I bought it), it's a good pocket camera... compact, lightweight, speedy performer, some features it does very well... 10x zoom, burst shooting, good AVCHD video in stereo, and if you experiment with the settings for stills (which I did have fun with), you may find them acceptable.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good compact camera", "Author": "Glenn Hershey", "ReviewID": "RBMAEG46QQBA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great value for the priceFull featured and high quality photosBought this model because various reviews indicated it has the fastest cycle time between shots of similar cameras - seems to be true in my experience - recycles fast both with and without flash, much fast than other compact cameras I've owned", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "RWCKJBZ4X1AV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything I want in a Point & Shoot.

The main problem with the camera is that the flash is weak.  But, if you turn off the flash and turn on the many other automated options for High Dynamic Range and Hand Held Night shots, it does a good job in low light conditions.  Many of our earlier problems were in situations where the flash would go off but was not strong enough to illuminate the main subject.  There are a few other improvements I'd suggest (wider HDR exposure bracketing and explicit control for the HDR for example), but that goes beyond what we mainly wanted, namely a full featured but highly automated camera with a good zoom range.  With the flash off, this Lumix SZ7 fits our requirements quite well and the price is right.  It just took me a while to try turning off the flash in low light conditions.  Definitely counter-intuitive.Earlier 2-star review below:We were looking forward to an automated point and shoot camera with powerful underlying capabilities like High Dynamic Range and high sensitivity MOS.  So we expected sharp images in difficult lighting conditions.  Unfortunately the \"Intelligent Auto\" mode never seems to figure out the proper settings.  With backlit subjects, it almost never uses the flash to illuminate the subject focused on.  Every once in a while, it uses the HDR mode, but with poor results.  And there's no way to force it to use HDR.  Overall though, the main problem is that, in spite of the advertised high sensitivity and name-brand lens, most of the photos come out fuzzy or blurry.  It does have a plethora of \"scene\" modes, so, if you have the time to figure out which kind of \"scene\" you are faced with and manually choose that mode, it might take good pictures.  But that was what I expected \"Intelligent Auto\" to do.  Perhaps I expected to much from a relatively inexpensive camera, but it has been a disappointment so far.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "One great little camera", "Author": "Right2Carry", "ReviewID": "R7PYKLU8DCBIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought 5 Canon Power-Shot cameras in a row... lost one, bought the same model to replace it; upgraded mega-pixels with the next, replaced it when the monitor screen stopped working after 3 years with the same model, which ate batteries like they were M&Ms.;  Gave Canon another chance with and  with the ELPH 100, which we enjoyed until wife lost it on a cruise this summer.  Given that 2 of the 5 had electrical problems, I decided to try something different and after reading many, many reviews, we landed on the Lumix SZ7.  One of the drivers was the promise that low light pictures would turn out better with the HS MOS sensor of the Lumix, and they do!  The electronics combined with the Leica lens (another feature that pushed me toward this camera) produce some of the best pix I've ever taken.  This camera is a winner in the point and shoot department.  Battery life is good, not great, so buy the extra batteries and the charger that are co-advertised on Amazon.

Did some research and EITHER I have no idea how to take good pics or the reviews I have seen are mainly bogus. I own mainly Canon cameras, though imagine any of the big companies make great digital cameras these days.My issue with this camera is purely with image quality. 14 megapixelss of fuzz. Let me be clear, the pics look fine at first, but EVERY PICTURE, no matter the settings, when you blow it up is fuzzy - not pixelated just not crisp AT ALL. Tried some of the quick tests I do with each camera I own (and I have not owned a DSLR, only point and shoot and bridge cameras, though nothing near this low cost). Used a tripod to hold still and took pics of a small sign outdoors bright light 10 meters away.- just far enough that with my poor vision could not read the sign. Picture looked great \"on the surface\", but as soon as you enlarge it to see what the sign says you notice that you can barely read the sign because it is so unclear.I have pictures that are fine from this trip for showing on a laptop, so long as I don't try to blow any up to see closeups of areas of the shots - none of them work no matter the settings.On the plus side the camera feels well built and is fairly fast.

This is a 720p HD format. It can shoot higher resolution 1080P also. In the ACHD Lite mode, it plays really nice doing transfers to iMovie. If I ignore the warnings regarding the files being too big and let it transfer at full resolution I get an \"Apple Intermediate Codec, Linear PCM, Timecode\" Quicktime file. This is a very good thing. It is in the full 1280\u2006\u00d7\u2006720 format that the camera encoded.Today I tested the second set of short demo clips. Not only did this middle of the road Macbook play the full size file, it did so in iMovie and Quicktime without a burp, or hitch. The full screen video file can be scanned rapidly back and forth in Quicktime, and it is so smooth and quick it is hard to believe. The onscreen image is beyond what I would expect from an inexpensive camera. It does not look inexpensive being played back from iMovie. ACHD 1280\u2006\u00d7\u2006720 and Apple Intermediate Codec play very nice together. I have reason to believe they are very similar formats. I have little idea what BluRay looks like. I do not watch much TV! For those of you who are familiar with it, I think AVCHD is basically the BluRay format. 1280x 720 is obviously not quite up to 1080P standards. It is close, and this hardware/software combo is not strained at that resolution. Those of you who know more about these issues should feel free to correct me if I am wrong.i am very impressed with this little camera. It starts quickly, and has a very useful display. This display washes out in direct sunlight. Some type of shade for the display is needed for outdoor work.  I have very little use for some of the manual overrides available. When a full auto camera does such good exposure, and quick focusing, I am happy to let it do its thing. The image quality is very useful for my purposes. I know that the Leica lens technically is not the sharpest available on the cheap shooters. This camera is not going to be used to make high quality still images. It is a light, simple, cheap HD movie encoder that will be a step up from a GoPro type camera. The images will be manipulated a lot in the software.Based on the success of the initial tests, I am getting more batteries and a big memory card for the camera, upgrading the ram and hard drive in the laptop, and getting on with it. In these modern times, all of the upgrades will be about $200.There is one tragic flaw for movie making- no external mic in on the SZ7.The SZ7 is Dolby Digital stereo, but having the mics stuck on top of the camera will not cut it. I have a Zoom portable audio recorder that will be used to close mic the talent. The camera audio will be useful for what I am doing, but it needs to be augmented. The Zoom uses the same format memory card.Online content producers might consider a camera like this in addition to a USB cam, laptop cam, etc. If only streaming to net, the quality is gone due to the compression used to get the bandwidth down. The only possible upside is that those bootlegging the material from the net will only have the bad quality product. The content provider will have a high resolution original if documenting on a second camera.  There is obviously no additional load on the streaming computer.The content provider then has better than an archival backup. They have an HD master of the program that is much higher quality than what was streamed. What if the online performance is a one of a kind event that cannot be duplicated? Streaming content providers may or may not get paid for what gets streamed live. It is possible for lots of people to view the performance and not pay for the pleasure in many settings. The content provider with an HD original has the opportunity in post production to create a new higher quality version. If they are in control of their content, image and copyright, they can get paid much more the next time around, hopefully in advance of handing over their work.I always have had a love/hate relationship with my cameras. I usually have the most hate for the cameras I spent the most money on. This Panasonic is an amazing tool for HD video on the cheap. It has a lot of what I need. It handles fast and smooth, and I can figure most of it out on the fly. The 10:1 optical Leica zoom is fabulous. The feature set is perfect for integration with iMovie. The SZ7, MacBook and iMovie '11 are a dream setup for churning out media on the cheap.The next upgrade: another SZ7 for 3D!", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waste of my time and money", "Author": "Chuck  S.", "ReviewID": "R13YC2J2DIVRYJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before purchasing the camera I read numerous reviews and several buyers coments.

I fiddled with every setting I could think of to no avail. I'd only had the camera 3 years, but loved it so I decided to get another Panasonic Lumix. That should tell you how much I think of Panasonic cameras (even \"broken\" ones).When my new camera arrived, I was thrilled for the extra zoom and the video feature of being able to zoom in and out, something I couldn't do with the FH20. But wait.....what is that little red button in the top right corner of the camera on the FH20 that looks like the little red button on the SZ7?. iA.....humbling little devil. That stands for \"Intelligent Auto\". It's frightening to learn your camera is smarter than you! I had never hit that button but, upon doing so, I had to wonder why Panasonic made it an option to take washed out pics instead of fantastic pics (although the washed out pics did have a certain charm if you squinted long enough).The SZ7 has enough new and different settings to keep me occupied for months. It will take me a while to adjust to the different settings from my ingrained (minus that little red button) use of the old, cherished camera.The picture and video quality seem great to me so far. I never leave the house without my camera tucked in my purse and this one (and the old one) suits that purpose perfectly. The SZ7 is actually slimmer than the FH20. Panasonic managed to pack more features into less body. Pretty awesome!There is a silver lining to this debacle.

I had an upcoming trip and thought it would be a good time to test it out. To provide some idea about my photography background, my other camera is a Canon XSi that I normally shoot in full manual so I'm one of those guys that knows what he is doing when taking a photo. I'm by no means a pixel peeper so those with questions about how the picture looks when enlarged all the way can skip this review.I bought the camera primarily due to its price, zoom range, quick focus and wide-angle. It was primarily intended for my wife who was using a Casio EX-S12 (12 MP, 3x zoom with 36 - 108mm equivalent to full frame). I've not been disappointed in those features except, perhaps, the distortion that I found in one wide-angle photo at 25mm (the person's head was elongated slightly when in the upper right thirds of the picture). Pictures came out good, for the most part. I had read that the battery life was low so I went in expecting that. I just didn't know how it would impact me. So I was bitterly disappointed when I found that it would not even last through a typical vacation day. The battery gave out on me halfway through the day (lasted for approx 170 pictures and 2 5-10 second videos). Having other cameras saved the day for me.I'm now contemplating whether to keep the camera or return it but will probably keep it since the pros outweigh the cons. I'll buy an extra battery and an external charger to compensate for the short battery life so that will need to be factored into the cost of the camera as well.I will update this review if any of my impressions about this camera change with further use of the camera.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I would not buy this.", "Author": "Armsmere", "ReviewID": "R24DGU7YJFP45M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did not have good luck with this camera.

I am very happy I did. The basic automatic settings work great. I hate to read directions, so I just experiment and learn as I go. The camera has a plethora of advanced features, including manual settings for shutter or aperture priority. It can rapidly fire off multiple pictures if you want to catch some fast action. It has an amazing Leica 20x zoom lens. It takes high quality stills and videos. It even has GPS. The list of possibilities for experimentation and creative photography goes on and on. If you're going on a trip or doing anything else away from home, you can put the camera in your pocket (or purse) and be ready for any opportunity.The camera is bigger than my light and slim Nikon Coolpix S52, but it still fits comfortably in my pants pocket. I just have to be careful to check the knob on the top of the camera to make sure it's in the right position after I take the camera out of my pocket. When I've forgotten to do that, the camera sometimes fires off multiple pictures or is in the wrong setting, thereby causing me to miss my shot. I also have to be careful not to touch the viewfinder screen so that I don't accidentally take photos I don't intend to take.I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and elsewhere of various point-and-shoot cameras wherein people compared various cameras in great detail. Those reviews helped me make my decision to buy the Panasonic Lumix ZS20. But I won't go into detail here. I'll just say that my old Nikon Coolpix S52 is a nice, simple little camera, but it lacks many of the features of the Panasonic. Plus it's impossible to see anything through the viewfinder outdoors in the sun, so you have to blindly point and shoot. However, the major gripe I have had with the Nikon is that it is painfully slow. It takes forever to react when I press the shutter, so I have missed many \"spur of-the-moment\" shots. As a former SLR user, I am used to, and still want, a camera that has very little shutter delay. Therefore, I chose the Panasonic. If shutter speed is very important to you, I highly recommend this camera. It's very quick. And the viewfinder is very bright and clear -- although it's still difficult to see exactly what you're taking a picture of in bright sun. I guess that's just something users of all these little cameras have to endure.I love this camera. I only have one noteworthy issue with the Panasonic Lumix ZS20. It eats batteries alive. Watch out if you take long videos, turn the camera off when you're not going to use it for a while, and be sure to turn off the GPS if you don't want to use it. Buy at least two extra batteries and keep all the batteries charged. If you plan to be away from home for a while, be sure to take battery chargers for your hotel room and your car. If you take your computer with you, also take the cord that comes with the camera that you can use to charge a battery while it's in your camera. (Despite some reviewers' negative comments, I have found this internal charging method to be handy at home and on the road.) If you remember to do these things, you won't run out of charged batteries at a critical moment -- as I have done when I didn't follow my own advice.Buy this camera at a good price and I think you'll be glad you did.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Fred Young", "ReviewID": "R3IPB6HTU5DE0T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having seen this camera advertised hundreds of times, I  bought it at a good price;  No real substance.

And that 480p video and 10 mega pixel photos are almost better than this new Panasonic.I've uploaded full 1080p videos on YouTube and they look nothing like video uploaded from the higher end Panasonic Models, like the DMC-SZ7.Since I want GOOD 1080p video, not 1080p video that looks like 360p, I will be returning it for a better model.I did a lot of testing, and still not very good.I got this Sony Cybershot wx150, man, it's like night and day compared to this....", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "good one", "Author": "ashik", "ReviewID": "R2T0RL5NB1DSZK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "just arrived today. i have gone through the reviews before buying, 'm just holding it and exploring.  at this moment i am very much happy having sz7 in my hand. got to take proper photos (few technical ones) to write something substantial, till then happy shooting :)", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wish I spent more money and got a better-one", "Author": "Chichi", "ReviewID": "R8PM7K0AVEO3E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm used to my Panasonic - Lumix DMC-FZ15 (full size) however I'm planning a trip to Europe and thought the smaller digital camera would be easier to carry.
