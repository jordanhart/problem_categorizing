So my review will not be full of technical stuff.I gave up film cameras quite a while ago.My first digicam was a whopping 1.3mps,which I thought was astounding.I gradually progressed up to the point where I have this little gem,all 12MP's of it. I am using it as a replacement for a small,but hard-working Nikon P&S.Not; a replacement,more of an addition...but I didn't want to carry a really expensive camera on my motorcycle,or when I take the menagerie to the dog park,so I use the Nikon for those things,and this Pentax for everything else.It takes wonderful photos.It's very intuitive,and if you have ever used a typical P&S; camera,you will catch up to this one in a few shoots.It takes good shots in any kind of outdoor lighting,and indoors as well.The clarity of each shot is great.Close-ups of my animals are especially good.I can see every whisker and the evil glistening in their eyes as they plot yet another way to create havoc in my house.I took one of my parrot,who hates cameras,and the \"pinning\" of his eyes was caught in all its maniacal  glory.I am going to use this tiny thing for a long time.It is extremely tiny,but that makes it more useable.Pocket-size is great for a P&S.I; haven't noticed any unusual color problems.All in all,it's a great camera,and I am quite happy with my purchase.13Feb09 Update: The camera is still working beautifully.And,now I have purchased my very first d-SLR,a Pentax,of course.Together,these two cameras will cover just about any situation I might find myself in,photo-ready.Pentax optics are still astounding.I am old-school film camera,and had Pentax cameras in different formats.I am so glad to see that people are still appreciating the work Pentax puts into their cameras and lenses.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "G.

Excellent quality of the pictures, simple menu, too many options, small size and so on. I had a Sony Cybershot and I was extremly disappointed from them. So bad camera, bad quality of the pictures,problem with the batteries and so on... Highly recommend Pentax brand and especially this camera!!!", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Ray Williams \"Master Gardener\"", "ReviewID": "R1F54HB0UXSQM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife's birthday present (Dec. 15). She is \"electronicly challenged\", but it is so easy for her to use. The pictures are so clear. I am sure there are better cameras out there, but I don't think you'll beat this one for the price. I am more than pleased, I am ecstatic.

When my wife saw it she started using it and likes if better than her large big name camera and I have to fight her to get to use it.For its small size it has a lot of features that normally are only found on larger more expensive cameras. I have owned Pentax cameras since Viet Nam and they usually match up nicely with most of the more well known brands.Would purchase this camera again today!", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great little camera!", "Author": "John W. Helderman \"Pathfinder\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1D7NJMM7ZYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the first four reviewers of this camera who all gave it top marks.  I have owned a 35mm Pentax for years and still prefer it for some types of photography.  I bought this Pentax digital just to get some experience with digital.  I am very impressed.  Operation is relatively easy to figure out and the pictures came out very clear just using the automatic settings.  As I learn how to use the camera I think my results will get even better.  I shied away from some of the other brands like Sony and Canon because of some of the bad reviews I read here at Amazon.  I think anyone who buys and uses this camera will be well pleased.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Really good Point and Shoot", "Author": "Nathan Johns", "ReviewID": "R1J4M09AM19UNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had quite a few Point and Shoot cameras, and this one is probably the best. I only have a few issues with it.I don't use most of the modes. I take nice pictures by just using the Auto Picture mode. The videos taken are decent too.Small zoom. I wish the zoom was a little bit better. The 3x normal zoom is fine, but when you zoom in further it swtiches to an optical zoom. The optical zoom is difficult to take clear photos with.The camera is definitely a pocket camera. I carry mine around with me at all times, and it never is a hassle.Fairly sturdy. I keep it in my pocket all the time, even during my current deployment to Afghanistan. Even with all the sand and dust, this camera still works like it did day 1.If you want to get a good point and shoot, but not spend $250, get this. You'll be glad you did. Take it out for an entire day and take hundreds of pictures. Get used to it before judging it.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb Compact Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1D7CEI0A3M315", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must admit I am Pentax fan.  I own the K2000 dSLR kit, and now the S12.  Before I got the S12, I previously owned the Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 10.1MP but it got lost right after a vacation.  I enjoyed the portability of the Casio and was mostly satisfied with its use, but something was just not right it, especially the blurry photos of further away objects--objects I could see with my naked eyes were blurry through the camera's lense.  I decided to give this one a try and it has exceeded my expectations.  It took me only about 30 minutes of experimenting with the various controls and settings to become confortable with usage.  I like the face recognition which is very active with the digital viewfinder.  It even recognized a face on a wall photo, no kidding.  I only wish this camera would let me zoom when I'm taking videos.  Since this was not bought to be a video camera, I can happily live with that.  By the way, I bought the silver and save me some bucks since the black cost almost twice as much, leaving me wondering what's really is the difference since they are the same model, separated only by the color.  Finally, while shopping by my local Walmart, I notice they carry lots of compact cameras like this from different brands but not a single Pentax. I started thinking to myself that if they had this one on the shelf next to the others, this one would be a hot seller.  hint..hint..hint...", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!", "Author": "BarbaraB1234 \"BarbaraB1234\"", "ReviewID": "REX9QO2ITEKFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera!

I read the previous reviews, and they didn't steer me wrong!!  While playing with this camera, I was sitting on my couch; aimed it out of the front door, and across 5 lanes of traffic, two medians, a parking lot and still was able to take a picture of a balcony of the apartment complex across from my home.  And, I'll just set the record straight...no, I'm not a peeping tom, but if you're a beginner (again, not the peeping) and want to catch those objects at a distance you won't be disappointed with the zoom!  My pictures have impressed even those who are really into photography.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Camera for the Price", "Author": "barbiedoll", "ReviewID": "RC2WCVNTM7PRL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Mom borrowed my digital camera when she went on vacation. I couldn't be without a portable digital camera for a couple of weeks, so I jumped on Amazon to get a new one. Since I already own one, I knew for sure that I didn't want to pay over $150 for one. I found this online for a GREAT price and the reviews were awesome, so I went ahead and purchased this one.I was not disappointed! This camera takes great pictures. I didn't give 5 stars because sometimes the pictures are not as focused if you take the picture in a hurry or something.

Ferrugia", "ReviewID": "R16WTY8NIF9INO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was exactly what I was looking for! I am very happy with its performance, the picture quality, battery life, features and how easy it is to use, and for the price, it can't be beat. The only drawback I have found is that the manual is like a novel, and I'm the type of person who likes to read the manuals cover to cover before using the product. This time, I chose not do that due to its length...I just wanted to jump right in and get started! However, I am GLAD the manual is as detailed as it is and it is easy to look up certain things as I go along. Also worthy of mentioning is that on the Pentax website, there is a feature to chat live with a REAL person in REAL time if you have a question or issue with your camera. I am pleased as punch with this camera!", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Makes me crazy", "Author": "jc3385865 \"jc3385865\"", "ReviewID": "R37TKM66RPXRS4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not user friendly, and doesn't take very good quality pictures. They tend to be grainy and lack true color. It is also difficult to obtain sharp images, they tend to come out blurry. I have to take three or four shots and hope one comes out good. I thought the image stabilization would help when taking pictures of people but it doesn't seem to help much. My cellphone camera is 100 times better than this one, and I find myself just leaving this one at home.The other thing I have trouble with is, every once in a while, the camera will decide that it doesn't want to let me turn on the flash. I try turning off the camera and re-powering it, and sometimes that helps...but other times I have to do a complete factory restore to get the flash to work. I would definitely not recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12-megapixel resolution captures enough detail for poster-sized prints\n3x optical zoom; Digital Shake Reduction\n2.5-inch LCD screen; Face Recognition function\nNew Dynamic Range Adjustment function\nCapture images to SD cards (not included); 21.1MB of built-in memory", "Name": "Pentax Optio S12 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XMan65WiL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0012Q72I4"}}
