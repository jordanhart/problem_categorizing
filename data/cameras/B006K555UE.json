{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Capable little camera", "Author": "Samuel McConnell", "ReviewID": "R2OEKATYWWC0NX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a rule, I generally buy and use cameras with a little bit more functionality, like the Nikon P7000 or D3100. However, the DSC-W610, the lowest-end of Sony's current crop of digital cameras, certainly fits the bill for a cheap, pocketable camera that will get the job done, as long as you don't expect too much from it.The camera comes with a battery, a charger, a USB cable, and a wrist strap. The USB cable is not your standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB cable, so if you don't plan on using an SD card reader, make sure not to lose that cable! Speaking of SD cards, this camera doesn't come with one, so make sure you pick one up. (The camera works with SD, SD-HC, and SD-XC cards as well as Memory Stick Pro Duo cards, so pretty much anything you throw at it will do.) Although the camera looks like it has a brushed aluminum front, this affect is applied with a textured sticker, and in fact the whole camera is rather thin plastic. It doesn't feel incredibly fragile, but also doesn't give me much hope that it would survive a moderate fall.The image quality is better than most if not all cell phone cameras, just as you'd expect from a standalone point and shoot. The sensor is moderately sensitive, shooting okay if noisy shots in low-light scenerios. The flash does its job, covering all of the image area (except just the corners when the lens is at its widest). However, don't expect pro-quality photos here, detail resolution when zoomed in all the way is poor, looking muddy and indistinct.The most unique option on this camera, and the reason we ended up choosing this camera, is Sony's sweep panorama mode. Click the shutter release, then slowly pan the camera right. The camera will make sure you held the camera straight enough (using an internal accelerometer, I'm sure) and automatically stitch the pictures together. It produces surprisingly good panoramas with very little work.The biggest differentiator between this camera and its slightly more expensive brother, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W620, is the movie mode. The 610 shoots at a paltry 640x480, while the 620 (and higher models) shoot at 720p HD. Keep this in mind when opting to save a few bucks.All in all, this camera is great for people who just want a cheap camera to keep in their pocket and not fuss about too many settings. If you demand excellent image quality, high-res video, or toughness in your camera, then you may want to pass on this one.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing for an amateur", "Author": "cwm \"cwm41\"", "ReviewID": "RW51GQ3K6EX6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just after graduating high school. I had a Sony Camera before this, and used it until it didn't work anymore. I was very excited when I took it with me to China, and it took amazing photos. Sadly, I lost it soon after arriving, and had to use friends cameras most of the time I was there. Compared to five different cameras, this one was easily the best. Many of the others took extremely blurry photos, didn't have panorama mode, and all of them went through their batteries fairly quickly. This camera took relatively few blurry photos, and for the first few days in a foreign country, taking hundreds of photos, I didn't need to charge it for three or four days. I also love the colors, the blue is gorgeous and it was helpful for telling it apart from my old camera, or my mom's camera at a glance. It is also quite small and light, smaller than any camera I've had before.After losing my camera was heartbroken. The day after I got back from China, I ordered a new one. I can't wait to get it and keep taking photos.Obviously, this is not a professional camera, but for a girl who loves taking photos, it is absolutely perfect.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love My Sony Cyber Shot , So Far So Good ,,", "Author": "of california", "ReviewID": "RJ1LDKXHREFRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little apprehensive about buying a Camera which is very new on the market ,I mean this is a 2012 model ,and the reviews are only a few for the same reason the camera is very new to the market ,but now that I have it here at home I just received today and took some very beautiful pictures very very surprised by the quality of photos ,before the Sony Cyber shot I had a Panasonic lumix ,very good camera but I give it to my nieces after three years of use , I have to say that the pictures of this Sony cyber the color the quality is superior , but the panasonic was only 12-MPs ,and the Sony is 14-MPs which undoubtedly is the reason it produces more beautiful photos ,,and is very very easy to use ,to set the day and time is super easy ,,I know it's a bit early to say just how good the camera is because just received the camera but it left me impressed so far ...", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Ame", "ReviewID": "R1RMSKK0YYDA9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a awesome camera, I was worried about spending so much for a camera online but it turned out to be a great deal.

The menu was so confusing and my pictures were always blurry. I'm sure it was due to operator error - but like I said, the menu was so confusing, so many things to scroll through and it had so many other features that changing scene/shots was like searching through a maze, every single time!This camera is so easy to navigate. And though there are several different modes - I find that 'easy' mode is just that...easy! It seems to always pick the best mode to fit the lighting and I rarely take a bad picture. Even in low lighting, pictures come out great. The battery life seems to last forever. I use a Sony type N and since I've had it, I've only had to recharge it once! It's slim, light, fits easily in my back pocket/small purse. Getting the battery out is not a problem and the battery/card compartment seems durable (other cameras have flimsy latches that break easy I've found). The viewing screen is large and though I don't usually take panoramic shots, it does work nicely. Simple, easy to navigate menu, great pictures, even in low lighting, and the video recorder also works well and it is easy to switch from camera to video. I posted two photos in the customer image section. Make sure you check out the omelet picture. Click on to see it full size. The colors just pop and it is so incredibly clear and crisp. It even has a \"food\" setting for morons like me that embarrass my family and friends by taking pictures of my food!

She wanted a \"real\" camera and her favorite color is pink, so this fit the bill. The camera is actually quite good in natural light and not bad indoors with a flash, but it's hardly what you'd call fast, nor does it work too well in low light and can't handle any kind of movement without blurring significantly. Then again, it was well under $100, so one shouldn't expect it to behave like an SLR. It's a handy little pocket camera for snapshots, and a great device for my daughter to learn with. This is my second Sony camera, and both have been sort of mixed performers - great in natural light, less so in anything else, and this one particularly seems to give things more of a yellowish tint most of the time. For my own use with pocket cameras, I've tried models from Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and Kodak, and Canon remains the best overall in image quality, which to me is far and away the most important feature.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony DSCW610 is totally awesome", "Author": "Cool Cam", "ReviewID": "R1SNMVECHV71Z9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is really cool..Panorama click is really great..The weight and size of the cam is very low....Easy to carry...", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "litle camera but goog quality photo", "Author": "jesus baduil", "ReviewID": "R1RQYZWJOQP5GZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchase this camera especially for holiday times this is a great instrument for recorded the moments that you spent with your familiy or friend the price of the camera was excellent for under 100 $ i am happy with this the camera include the usb cable, baterry charge, manual and wrist strap no include carry case and memory for storage your photo and video", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "14.1 MP Pink Sony Camera", "Author": "68camarogirl", "ReviewID": "R28XNMA5IAL53Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera arrived as specified and packed well.

The camera is very light compared to the ones I've used in the past. It is also very small and sleek so it'll fit in your pocket or tiny handbag for a night out.

Immediately went to my computer, hooked up the USB cable and tried to transfer said photos. But my computer would not recognize the camera, no big deal right? I downloaded the drivers and some crappy software Sony had specifically for the camera. Still nothing so I go ahead and try a different USB port and cable with no luck. Next step was I tried my other desktop with no luck, laptop with no luck. So I took the camera to work the next day and tried just about every freakin computer in the joint, downloading the drivers and software along this horrible journey. Okay, maybe my colleagues and I are missing something obvious here, so I contacted Sony eSupport and had a live chat with a \"Technical Professional\" which accumulated in nothing more then the guy sending me random links to the eSupport site for 20 minutes. So I emailed the Sony Support and got some copy and paste reply with no real useful information. By this point I was just about admit defeat and accept the camera and support was horrible, I tried 1 valiant more time and called tech support, after the 43 minute wait (I timed it with my phones stop watch) I got to talk to a real live person! I obliged the support lady and redid troubleshooting I had done a few times before and I was getting no where fast. As a last ditch effort she put me in touch with a website to repair the faulty camera, I filled in my information and described what has been going on. I then received a email from the repair service for Sony that stated I would get instructions via regular mail within a week. So 18 days later this package finally arrives and inside was a USB cable and letter explaining how a new USB cable and a factory reset (which I had done multiple times by this point) should solve my issues. I reset the camera and tried the new USB cable and surprise, surprise it didn't work. So I went back and reread the letter for instructions on how to send the camera back for \"further repairs\" and of course I was responsible for shipping costs, I expected this but I didn't expect the $85.00 they wanted for \"potential repairs and parts\".In short, I would avoid this camera and most Sony products like the plague. Camera worked okay, it was nothing special and the display sometimes showed blurry images for no apparent reason. My years old Kodak C433 is much sturdier but of course doesn't take as good of pictures but after this experience I wouldn't trade that Kodak relic for any Sony camera.

The lens doesn't retract and close completely but gets stuck and can't be turned off.  (My workaround is to remove and reinsert the battery.)  The view screen got scratched up almost immediately.  I also dislike paying for Sony's proprietary memory cards and batteries. (A spare battery costs half again the cost of the camera and is necessary because the battery warning is insufficient.)

It detects the corrects scene.Flash produces proper colors & does well in low light.Expect digital noise, as you should expect that with any point & shoot with a small sensor & high megapixels. I don't think it will be noticeable if cropping is kept to a minimum & prints are kept small - 4x6 maybe up to 8x10. If you are a pixel peeper (like me) you SHOULD NOT use a point & shoot or smartphone. Go for a DSLR or possibly the newer compacts with large sensors or the mirrorless cameras do well.Autofocus is acceptable speed.My daughter has caught a few action shots of my younger sons shooting a basketball w/minimal blur.I have not tried video.This camera is very small & thin, which is nice to fit in a pocket if you don't want to carry any bulk.Even though this was bought for a teenager, I think this would be a good camera for everyday family shots.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "I got my money worth Sony digital camera", "Author": "Noah's Mom", "ReviewID": "R7ZV2JVQ7AJ3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera came package as issued.

Not wanting to rely upon smartphone pictures for the remainder of the trip, I purchased another digital point and shoot - the Sony Cyber-shot DSCW610.  I purchased the 610, as options were very limited in that location; also, as I had been forewarned, electronics prices in that location were high - higher than the MSRP in the U.S. and about 50% higher than prices at Amazon, so the 610, near the bottom of the price range for digital point and shoots, made sense in the circumstances.Indeed, one of the strengths of the 610 is its low price point.  Another strength is that it truly is \"pocketable\" - it comfortably fits in a shirt or pants pocket; the worst digital picture is the one you can't take because you don't have your camera with you!As noted by others, the 610 has a plastic case (with only the appearance of brushed metal) and doesn't feel at all substantial.  (As my fall on the Canon 780 proved, however, even a metal case will not stand up to a strong enough force.)  The largest shortcoming of the 610 seems to be that the auto-focus works relatively slowly.  Also, my experience has been that the AF doesn't seem to work well consistently - many of my shots with the 610 do not seem to be \"crisp\".  (Reviewing the pictures I took with the Canon 780 prior to its destruction and the images captured with the Sony 610, I found that my \"batting average\" was definitely better with the Canon 780.  I acknowledge that there is a substantial difference in the price of the two cameras.)  While the controls on the 610, in general, are straight-forward and intuitive, the on / off switch and the shutter are both rectangles adjacent to one another on the top surface of the camera and sometimes, by feel only, I have to consider which is which (the shutter is slightly larger than the on / off and protrudes a very small amount from the camera top, whereas the on / off is very slightly recessed).As other reviewers have noted, the computer connector on the Cyber-shot 610 is not a standard size, so don't lose the provided cable!If price and size are important considerations, and if you are not too picky about your pictures, then the Sony Cyber-shot 610 may be a perfectly reasonable choice for you.  If you have higher expectations, then you should consider other cameras.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "BUENA CAMARA", "Author": "KAREN RODRIGUEZ", "ReviewID": "R1H201UO9XZF7V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EXCELENTE C\u00c1MARA ..
