Williams", "ReviewID": "R2II1PQKA03OD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera isn't out a month and already the scalpers are trying to unload european T2is on us.  Please don't fall for this and pay $200 above list price.  Be patient and Canon will very soon release another batch of T2i cameras.  It will be worth the wait, I promise.  If you must have something instantly, get the T1i.  It's a lot cheaper and in stock.  The T2i has some nice improvements over the T1i like a sharper LCD screen (1.04 million dots}, 18 M.P. vs. 15 and a better movie mode. However, this is no movie camera.  It's a still camera that takes video.  If you shoot lots of video, get a Canon video camera.  That's what it was designed to do. The T2i will go to 6400 iso on auto, a full stop faster than the T1i.  Noise at 6400 iso is suprisingly absent.  It has a user friendly menu, easy to navigate and unnessary for most shooting applications.  It handles slightly diferent than the T1i in that the left grip is a bit thicker and must be grasped more firmly. Autofocus is very fast and accurate.  As this camera is very light and smallish to hold, and easy to drop, I would recommend the acc. bat grip.  It makes vertical shots very easy to take and gives you more shots per charge especially when using flash or extended live view. Some reviewers have claimed that the T2i or it's kit lens doesn't take sharp photos.  What they have failed to notice is that in portrait mode, images are deliberately softer for efect.  In the P or auto mode, there is no problem.  The manual explains this.  The kit lens is no L lens but it is quite sharp.  The manual itself is not a work of art and I would recommend one of the many field manuals that are certain to follow.  They are more in depth and take the time to better explain all camera functions.  They are available here at Amazon.  All in all, the T2i is very very nice and a pleasure to use.  Nikon will have a very tough time topping it.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wait for real upgrade", "Author": "GK \"GK\"", "ReviewID": "R22OYM4EBOO0E4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sony SLR: In-body image stabilization that works well (around 2 stop advantage)Olympus SLR: In-body image stabilization that works well (around 4 stop advantage)No In-body image stabilization like Sony & OlympusNo Tilt & Swivel LCDNo 1080p HD video recording 60 fps", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheating", "Author": "Faisal", "ReviewID": "R304463Y1IQK5W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Helloi didnt get the 550D Camera i received Rebel T2i which not same on the pictures that posted by the seller!!i payed extra 100 dollar for nothing check Rebel T2i Prices and check this one!!i bought it because it suppose to be 550D not Rebel T2i", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "European version of the Canon EOS Rebel T2i kit\n18.0-megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor; DIGIC 4 image processor for high image quality and speed\nKit includes 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens\nISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim light; enhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system\nImproved EOS Movie mode with manual exposure control and expanded recording 1920 x 1080 (Full HD)", "Name": "Canon EOS 550D (European EOS Rebel T2i) 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Body & Lens made in Japan)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41luugHBe8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0037KM2IS"}}
