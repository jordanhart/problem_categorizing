Morris \"setaside2\"", "ReviewID": "RP2ZK9I6FY56M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are a lot of misconceptions about the new QX product... so I'll just give you my history.I shoot professionally. I work in the field, out of my house at least half the month. I take a lot of gear with me. I already have an Sony DSC-RX100/B 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x Zoom, which I absolutely adore (and you won't find someone who doesn't love this camera), along with my DSLR gear. Why would I ever need ANOTHER? I didn't :) truth. BUT being on the road affords me the option to be able to share my images from around my territory. I am lucky in that I get to see a lot of desolation just waiting to be captured. Sometimes, though, there are angles I just can't get, things that I see that my DSLR and my RX100 simply aren't capable of reaching either because of obstacles in the way, size issues (my A99v is huge), etc...Which is where the QX comes in. I simply do not ever attach this camera to my Samsung Galaxy S4. Ever. I see zero need for it and feel that it actually limits the camera's potential to do so. I have a WiFi signal! Put the damn camera where I damn well want to. Indispensable tool?Joby GPM-A1EN GorillaPod Magnetic Flexible Tripod (Black). A tool that allows me to stick the QX up light poles, traffic signals, car tops and sides, metal tables and chairs, the siding of an REI building, ladders, whatever allows those magnetic feet to work, man.  Put the camera where you want it. Since the QX is blessed with a 1/4 20 tripod mount, it goes onto any 1/4 20 adapted product. I've seen them on boom poles, I've seen them on string. I've seen them mounted on GoPro! adapters, you name it. Because it's small enough to fit, you see, and that gives it a lot of photographic hope. I know a pro in Fresno, CA who has 4 of the Sony DSC-QX100 Smartphone Attachable Lens-style Camera He also has 4 assistants running tablets. They put that little camera every where: in the bouquet while the bride is walking around with it, at the base of the cake for the cutting, on the podium or altar for intimate shots no photographer would ever be allowed to make. Brilliant. This camera is designed to make you consider the box you work in... and then bust it open. It is the sign of many good things to come for both mobile photographers as well as the hobbyists and pros. Personally, I'm glad it's Sony doing it. I've lost a lot of faith in the big two of late: they are simply not innovating in any direction I approve of. In most cases, in fact, they simply release warmed over versions of their old stuff and THAT, friends and neighbors, bores me outright.I have had excellent luck with my wifi connection with two common problems: #1.) if you're in a room with heavy cellular traffic happening, your wifi range will definitely drop. We've had it in a studio green room, running the camera 75 ft away. Amazing. We've also had it in a convention center where there is enough telcomm taking place to fry a third world country and I'd say we got 20ft out of it before things went really laggy, or just froze. #2.) I have definitely found that, when the camera reaches one bar of battery life, it's not connecting. Hence the minus one star. I know that WiFi is a lot of draw but lithium batteries are supposed to be a near perfect power chart: flat until it dies... and this indicates that the camera pulls perhaps a little too much, is a little too inefficient. I have not had a QX100 long enough to know if it's any better but, since it uses the same battery, I suspect it has the same issues. Also, please note: the battery life will vary wildly depending on the mode you have it in: if in the Green Auto or Program modes, it will last a lot longer than the Superior (Gold) Auto I'm recommending. I deal with the shorter battery life simply because I feel Gold yields much better images overall. Only scenario it didn't, where I switched to Program and dealt with the +/- compensation, was shooting my son's jazz band concert. And then, thank god it had -2 stop ability.The picture quality ranges from average to how the hell did this little thing capture that?? And it's hard to say what you'll get out of it: it heavily depends on on the lighting, and what scene mode the camera arbitrarily chooses... which for me means it has taken on the charm of lomography, and I use it as carelessly because of it. If I get something good (which I tend to, it's not a crappy camera by any means... but it IS a compact digital camera and comes with compact digital camera issues), then I'll process it right on the cellphone in PicSay Pro (usually. Snapseed on the tablet), and send it off. The nice bit: I can actually print these images because they ARE printable, unlike most cellphones. I will rarely if ever use the camera part of my camera phone ever again.One suggestion: despite the fact that it has the three modes of operation, I have found that your best chance for success in MOST situations is to leave it in Superior Auto (the gold mode). This mode does phenomenal HDR when necessary. Some of the images have been stunning, honestly. It will also engage a high iso image stack if it doesn't like the lighting. From what I can tell it's up to 6 images at high sensitivity that it will then composite, creating a much, much cleaner file than one shot could create. These two things are invaluable on my RX100 and while I'm disappointed I can't pick them when I wanna on the QX10, I can deal with it. It's app based. Apps are made to be upgraded. So my inner mobile optimist is in full swing. :)If you're interested, feel free to head to my instagram.com/setaside2 or search instagram for #qxshooter or #qx10 and you'll find what you're looking for. Plenty of demonstrations of what a QX can do, and where it can go.Feel free to find me and ask questions.UPDATE: Now that the new firmware upgrade has been installed I have noticed that the latency issues have really gone down, which is a nice surprise, and that the iPhone in the house connects a great deal quicker. It's still a pain to get the iPhone up and running (Please, Apple, for the love of humanity, license NFC and deal with it) but once it's running it's certainly a much more satisfying experience than it was before. The added ability to change ISO is nice but I hardly ever use it and the video quality has indeed been improved... plus the 1920 makes things a little less awkward for mixing it with other sources. All in all a big plus to Sony for adding features that matter and improving the experience. It isn't done BUT it has been improved and that is saying something.And thanks to those who've reached out. Glad I could help.

In it's current format, shoppers looking for the Sony DSC-QX100 may be mislead by reading reviews of the cheaper QX10 model.This preliminary review I am providing is for the Sony DSC-QX100.As an owner of the Sony NEX-5N, NEX-6, and NEX-7 model cameras I was optimistic that the QX100 with it's f/1.8 Zeiss lens and 20MP sensor would meet my expectations, and be comparable in image quality to the NEX line of cameras. So far (all be it limited at the moment) the pictures I have taken do meet my standards in image quality. All the sharpness and creamy bokeh are present as you would expect with a wide 1.8 Zeiss lens. The sharpness is there thanks to the 20 megapixels, and the level of noise in low light is surprisingly low for such a high MP sensor.I have not had the opportunity to shoot in bright sunny conditions yet; however, my initial experiences in low light photography with this camera are impressive. It even manages to provide a sharp blur free image with shutter speeds as low as 1/30th of a second.It connects easily with your phone using the Sony PlayMemories free app, has complete control via the phone screen (including touch focus, exposure bracketing, zoom, etc.), and allows the user to take pictures at unusual point of views which makes for some interesting creative imagery.So far, my only gripes are that you have to hit the back button each time you snap a picture (this may be fixed with a future firmware update), and the bracket to attach to a phone is not big enough to attach to larger smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note.Basically, this camera is the exact specs as the Sony RX100 camera without the screen, so I would advise anyone thinking about buying this lens to also check out the reviews on the Sony RX100 to get further insight until we can weed out all the initial negative reviews currently coming in from the like of people who either don't even own the camera (but always seem to have something to say), or the nonsensical people who give this camera a one star review because \"their app on their phone crashed\".I will be posting example pictures tomorrow (9/26/13) on Amazon, and will provide a further update to this review.*** Update 10/22 *****So far I have been very impressed with the versatility of this product. It really opens up a whole new world of shooting possibilities. I have been using it on an Android smartphone and have had no connection problems with the direct WiFi. The only drawback I am experiencing is skies \"blowing out\" and becoming over exposed when taking pictures in very bright sunlight - Although you can compensate for this slightly by altering the bracketing. Please check out some of my example pictures I have posted on Amazon. I will post more over the next few days.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good concept, poor execution", "Author": "M. Moline", "ReviewID": "R31JRTHFTGW9F1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered the DSC-QX10/B and used it for about a week with my iPhone before ultimately deciding to return it.  Why?Pros:* Picture quality is good.  Much better than built-in phone camera.* Zoom is good.* Detachability is good.  I used the lens off-phone several times with nice results that would have been impractical or impossible to get otherwise.* Video is very good.  Espcially outdoors in bright light (duh) but even inside, video is good.Minor Cons* Does not use phone GPS - there is no geotagging on the images.* EXIF data does not indicate which shooting mode was used for the image* no way to transfer images over wifi to computer.  The full-size images and videos are stored on the microSD card. To get them to the computer you must copy them to the phone then phone to computer.  Or, remove the sd card from the camera and insert in computer.  Just plugging in the USB cable from lens to computer did not recognize it as a device that could be downloaded.  Often times there was not enough space on the phone to transfer all the images there first, then move to computer, which meant removing the mounting bracket from the lens in order to acces the card slot, then removing the miniscule memory card, putting it in an adapter, plugging it into the computer, etc etc.  Too many steps!  Maybe this could be fixed in future releases.And to be fair, you can put a pretty big card in there and the lens will send low-res 2MB previews to your phone \"immediately\"  (still takes a few seconds).  Those previews are good enough for social posting and knowing that you got the shot.  Then you can download at the end of the day when you're back at home, as opposed to out in the wild.Major cons:* WiFi only.  This device creates its own wifi network to which you connect the phone.  That means the phone is no longer on whatever wifi it was using previously.  It also means an extra 30-60 seconds of fiddling-around with the phone to actually get to the point where you can take a picture.  I don't understand why this isn't bluetooth?  really.* Does not feel rugged enough.  This feels too cheaply constructed for what I see as the intended use of carrying it around in your bag and attaching it to your phone when you want a good pic.  There is no case provided with the unit.  Maybe it could survive \"life in the backpack\" but I doubt it.  Not for a precision optical device with multiple lenses and motors and such.  Just doesn't feel like it's ready for the real world trials.* Time to deploy.  The tests I performed were to have the lens immediately accessible at the top of the bag without any hunting for it, and the bag off my shoulder and open.  Then I timed how long to remove lens from bag, power on, open mounting bracket, attach to phone, change network on phone, launch special camera app, and then finally take a picture in whatever mode the app happened to launch in without making any other decisions about what kind of image or settings.  Best I did was 58 seconds.  And if the wifi on the lens didn't come up right away, it was a lot more.Why isn't this bluetooth?I hope a lot of the functionality of this product can be improved with future app updates... and maybe even firmware too.  But the limiting factor is still the wifi-only connection with no bluetooth.  Changing my phone's network connection should not be a requirement for taking a picture.Overall, good concept, poor execution.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the concept, the execution is a mixed bag, app needs improvement", "Author": "onestopnyc", "ReviewID": "R3J8D7U3GO5CGX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was excited to finally get my QX-10 (I refuse to spend $500 for the QX100 since I own the RX100II and no one should really buy the QX100 ). For $250 the QX 10 has some cool features and uses and has worked pretty well for me (runing iOS 7 and latest version of the Sony App). The connection via wifi works, I agree that the whole password thing is silly. How many people are going to try to connect to your camera as you are taking pictures? but once you enter the password at least you don't have to do it again.Overall it works pretty well, but the real only point for this product is the 10x optical zoom. The iPhone 5s has a really good camera but the digital zoom is useless since all you are doing is cropping the pixels. This at least helps get you closer to the subject with no loss of resolution.Sony needs to update the app, give more options for creative controls, and a major one, ALLOW THE APP TO FORMAT THE MICRO SD CARD. Right now you can't and have to do it I guess by connecting it to the computer and erasing the card.Is it perfect? NO, but it's the first product of its kind and most of the product is the app which Sony can improve.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "QX-100 - Unique, great lens, great photos", "Author": "alysania \"alysania\"", "ReviewID": "RSKH38DLULK4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EDIT: 12 March 2013Sony has addressed a few issues.  There's a bigger clip in the works for Phablets and Tablets, due April 2014 in Japan (in the USA likely a short bit later or grab one via a reseller).There's also been a firmware update that allows for a few new options, notably an ISO setting, movie recording up to 1920x1080(30p), and shutter speed priority shooting mode (QX-100 only).-------------------------I'm pairing the QX-100 with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  I first had to pair it using WiFi, then once it connected the first time, I was able to use NFC pairing instead, allowing my phone to turn on the camera with a simple tap of the phone to the lens \"Z\" mark.  Using NFC, I've found, is far superior to using WiFi pairing - the software loads and pairs faster than with WiFi.  I've only been using this handheld or on a table/tripod since the clip doesn't fit on my phone with the phone case on.  It does just barely squeeze onto the Note 3 with the case off, but I'm a chronic phone dropper and taking the case off isn't really an option.Full Disclosure: I'm a pro who uses big, clunky, DSLRs, and loves them to bits, but there are just some times when carrying around a bag that heavy with a bunch of lenses and gear in it isn't practical or feasible.  This seems to be a great compromise - it's smaller than any of my DSLR lenses, and while it doesn't perform like a DSLR, the software still allows me to modify most of the same settings (whereas my cellphone onboard camera doesn't).  There's no true manual mode, but between P and A modes, I manage to get what I want.Pros:*Great low light performance - very little noise for what it is, but it definitely helps to use a tripod or gorillapod or something similar.*Size - it's so compact and small, you can take it into interesting angles not accessible by other cameras.*Picture quality is great - that lens!*Photos save to the microSD card on the lens but can easily be copied to the phone.  Tapping the review image lets the image stay up until you go back to camera mode.Cons:*Low Light focusing is near impossible in auto mode.  I usually have to switch to manual.  If I tap a focus point, it hunts, and never sticks.*The clip doesn't fit on my phone with the case on.  It just barely squeezes on with the case off.  Not a big con, but still an issue.*Software!  The software tends to freeze and lock up occasionally.  It usually comes back, but the waiting time can mean missing a shot.I'd love to see...*Better white balance options, including a custom WB setting taken off a reference photo*Quicker reponse time - the lag/freezing in the app is a little annoying*A bigger clip", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "What are people complaining about? - This camera is FANTASTIC!", "Author": "J. Quinnell", "ReviewID": "R2TWB6TAFRD3V9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an academically trained photographer with eight years of professional experience. I've mostly done documentary style shooting for various non-profits and newspapers.I caught wind of the Sony DSC-QX100 at Adorama.com and placed an order through Amazon immediately. I purchased this camera for my girlfriend who recently took a job in charge of marketing and graphic design for our local United Way and Volunteer Center. Both organizations have never had a photographer on staff so my girlfriend is really starting from scratch to build an archive of useful photos.She's at an intermediate photography level who needed a camera that was quick and easy to use and allowed her to immediately post images online, but also with enough resolution power to print a poster or billboard from an image if needed. This camera does it all! She pairs it with her Samsung Galaxy S3 and she's had no trouble losing the signal between the two devices. She keeps the clip on her phone at all times (it's a tight fit with the Otterbox Defender on the phone) and then just twists the lens into place when needed. They sync up very quickly and she's ready to shoot. So far, she's used the QX100 at an indoor charity event (Fantastic low light captures), a playground being constructed by the Green Bay Packers (Outdoors, daytime - crisp and clean images - great color capture) and various volunteer activities on Make-A-Difference Day (today). She posted images online today within seconds of them being taken to help bring in more volunteers at sites where further help was needed.I also purchased the SanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 for both her phone and the camera and the Sony Cyber-shot Camera Kit that includes a Travel Charger and N Type Battery ACCCSBN.I've spent hours testing out the QX100 and my girlfriend has now used it for three work events and we both think it's great. I don't know if the folks who are posting the low scores are not giving it enough time or what, but I think this is an incredible camera. 5 Stars!!!", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "\"Fun\"tastic device.", "Author": "A. B.", "ReviewID": "R2YXGQXEE789H8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the Sony QX-10 that I received 6 1/2 hrs ago. Decided to go for the lower end lens instead of the 100. I already own a Canon DSLR and a Sony NEXc3 (plus several smaller P&S;). I wanted something that will coexist with my phone's camera but didn't want to carry \"another\" camera for certain situations. Combining a good lens with its features with a smartphone and its features...Genius. Yeah, maybe carrying a P&S; would be simpler but it's the possibilities of using the lens is what I'm interested in. Having the screen right in your line of sight while the lens is facing somewhere else like taking a \"selfie\" or low to the ground without laying down looking at the screen. Endless possibilities of taking incredible shots. If you want to take quick shots of something/someone I don't think this is for you. But for other shots....Set up is incredibly fast. Download the sony playmemories app and input password. That's it. Or turn on NFC and tap. Pics that I've taken are satisfactory so far. All just quick test shots to see that it actually does what it say. And I'm very surprised that this WORKS flawlessly on Android phones (both Note 2 and Galaxy S2) and the complaints and negative reviews are from iPhone users and complaints are more or less based on the Sony Playmemories App for iOS instead of the lens itself.Also, I agree with another reviewer (Paul B) with his gripes. Those were the same two things I complained about - Hitting the back button to take another pic and bracket not wide enough for my Note 2 but perfectly with my older phone Galaxy S2.  I am hoping that Sony will put out more accessories for the lens at a very reasonable price (doubt that).  Accessories like bigger bracket attachments in various sizing and a waterproof casing so one can use the lens like GoPro style.The LENS itself is awesome and deserves 5 stars. But the Sony Playmemories app needs major improvements and right now this is the only weakness for the lens. Thankfully Sony released the API so 3rd Party apps should be popping up soon (camera360). I've got 2 1/2 weeks to play around with this lens/phone combo before going on a trip. I don't want to lug around my dslr or micro4/3 to where I'm going. My main camera will be my trusty canon s95 for most of my shots. And this lens will be my funky out of this world crazy shots.EDIT 9/26/13:Figured out one of my gripes. Hitting the back button to take another pic option CAN be changed on the Sony Playmemories app. Just need to change the \"Review Image\". There are 3 options: ON (which leaves the picture on until you hit the back button to go back to camera), 2sec (2 second review of shot, usual for most cameras) or OFF (no review of picture taken).

I am not sure about how long it's going to take through NFC. It's only good for taking self / group picture without asking other people's help or when you have a lot of time to wait for your phone link with the lens. Another downside is your cell phone battery will drop very fast. You need external power bank for your cell phone if you play them very often (Battery for lens does not drop fast).

I'm just a normal person who doesn't own a DSLR and have been content using my phone's camera for taking pictures on the fly and a Casio point-and-shoot if I want better quality photos.  I don't usually carry my point-and-shoot, though, so I was mostly left with the phone camera, which for me isn't the best since I have the Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX HD which is pretty well known for taking sub par fuzzy images.  When I originally saw this on a tech site, I was instantly intrigued.  So far, I haven't been disappointed.The packaging is pretty cool.  It comes in a small cylinder shaped box and includes manuals, a quick start up guide, battery, usb charger, phone attachment, and wrist strap.  It doesn't include a micro SD card, but that really isn't needed with this device anyway since photos taken with it instantly transfers to your phone.Set up was quick and easy.  It took a few seconds to pair up with my phone, and that may be a nuisance if you're looking to quickly whip out your lens for a quick photo op.  It's actually much faster if you use the NFC capability.  As soon as I tapped my lens to my phone, the lens turned itself on, the app booted up, and I was connected and ready to go.  I used the lens both while attached to my phone and separately in my hand.  The lens attachment was able to easily fit on my phone which was in a case.  The fit was snug and secure.  If using it this way, it's just as easy to tap the phone screen to take a picture as it is to use the shutter button on the lower left of the lens.  Using the lens separately was also fun.I was able to get some great close angles during test shots of my sleeping dog without shoving my phone in her face.  Although there is no flash, this lens handles low lights pretty well.  Pretty much every picture I took with this lens was head and shoulders above my phone's camera, quality wise.  This might not mean much to a lot of people who know the quality of photos my phone takes, but this is great for me.  I love everything else about my phone and don't plan on getting rid of it any time soon; the only thing I wasn't too keen on was its camera.  With this lens, however, I can hold on to my phone as long as I want.  Even if trading up phones, camera quality won't be as big a deal with me because I can just attach this lens.  Even better, my current tablet (the original Nexus 7) doesn't include a camera.  That always sort of irked me, but now I have this awesome lens I could use with it.  I can use this lens with any and all my devices.This lens might not be for everyone; the price might not be attractive enough, the picture quality won't be DSLR, and a lot of people won't see the need in carrying an extra accessory around just for photos.  But for me, this thing is great.  It's small and compact and can easily fit into my coat pockets or purse.  The quality of photos are on par with a point-and-shoot and although I'll still continue to use my phone's included camera for those quick blink-and-you-miss-it photo ops, if I have a few seconds to spare to whip out this little guy and tap it to my phone, I'll definitely be using this instead.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "QX100 gets 5 Stars based on Zeiss lens picture quality and low-light abilities (just be aware it currently has no flash)", "Author": "Courtney Dawn", "ReviewID": "R1KXH5F2HKV4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, my 5 star for the QX100 is based upon that I knew what I was getting here.The pictures are beauty and perfection.  The zooming is optical zooming and perfect (not just a digital degrading trick).  This IS a Zeiss lens after all. It has a low f-stop 1.8 in wide angle and 4.9 at full telephoto (the f-stop is what determines how much light is allowed into the aperture (the lower the number the better [an f-stop too high is why you can't get decent pictures inside a sports auditorium]).Being separate from the camera is a plus that most aren't aware of: (1) My wife can carry it in her purse and clip it on when wanted; (2) but, you can hold it separately from your phone to be discreet about what subject matter you are shooting (I can hold by my side and aim it at the subject of the picture while looking at my phone which is not aimed at the subject --very sneaky).But, again, look through the reviews and you will see that nobody disputes that it takes beautiful pictures.  IT DOES.Now, at the beginning, I said \"I knew what I was getting\".  Here are the shortcomings that I knew about prior to getting (my Mom got off of Amazon as a present for me, her adult son):(1) No Flash.  This is a big shortcoming - not sure why they haven't tried harder to manage a way to tie into the phone's flash for use, but they haven't.  However, with a low f-stop, the need for a flash is minimized, but when you need a flash - you need one.  It should have tied into a flash somehow.(2) It is uses Wi-Fi on iPhone.  This is more Apple's fault for not having NFC in the iPhone of any model (I have a an iPhone 5s).  But, I don't know why it doesn't use bluetooth.  The problem with using wifi is that if your on a wifi network currently then you have to change to the wifi network that is the lens (yes you have to change to the wifi network \"DIRECT-m2Q0:DSC-QX100\").(3) There is a lag if you want to view take the pictures and view them after taken.  My suggestion is just to view them later.If you love taking pictures, and want great pictures from you phone, a very nice Zeiss Lens is what this is and for that I say this Sony lens delivers the goods and for that it is phenomenal.  BUT, it is definitely not something that will make your phone a replacement to a DSLR, so you need to know that going in.  Now, most of those complaining are aware of that, and are complaining to the design team at Sony that chose to leave ignore some items that it knew it should have included.  I am sure if this lens is even a moderate success, then Sony will produce future models that will have the complete package of bells and whistles that it should have from the beginning.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera works great!", "Author": "Thanh Q.

The pictures as well as the video are so clear and crisp, they're unbelievable.

You just turn on the camera and place your phone near it and boom, their connected. Once you get used to the process, it's a breeze to connect. None of the Iphones, including the latest 5s models have it, so that's where the sources of many of all the complains that I see here. It was not designed with the Iphones in mind, despite their popularity. The camera was designed to work best with Sony latest flagship phones.Don't bother if you have a cheap old smart phone with a low resolution camera and want to complement it with the QX-100 because it won't work that way. At least a quad core CPU phone is able to pull this off as the camera has to send wireless images continuously to the phone and the phone must process them fast enough so that we can use the phone as our viewfinder.

Make sure your device is on same wifi network as the camera (it has its own wifi address so connect to that, Android with NFC makes this hassle free)4. Type annoying pw that is found on one the tags of the camera (your supposed to type it once only but I had to do it numerous times after exiting the app and shutting the camera off)5. Carefully snap on to your device and test it out.Overall the process is supposed to be simple but you may run into problems with scanning, connecting and disconnecting oh and LAG lots of lag.I noticed that the camera works better with an Android device since the iPhone had trouble scanning for the camera wifi network as well as automatically connecting when powered on. The android did a much better job at scanning and connecting.There's a bit of lag (depends on your device) when taking photos, aiming at your subject(s) and connecting. It gets frustrating really fast that you end up using the camera app on your device.For some reason my iPhone tended to drop connection compared to my Android devices (the NFC really helps).There are two ways to take a photo, you can use the physical button located on the side of the camera or you can use the sony app. Just make sure that the subject you are taking a picture of is not moving otherwise the lag will give you a nice blurry photo.The zoom feature is actually pretty nice but also lags (there is too much lag between communication of the sony software and the camera).There is no flash so make sure you have plenty of light source otherwise you will get some very dark photos.Photo quality varies (light source) and while the photos are not that bad, I found most to be washed out, over saturated, unbalanced tones and a bit noisy (not as clear as I hoped). I only got a few shots that I actually liked and this was probably due to the light source. I should also note that most of my photos were taken outside, quality improved indoors in a well lit room.I am not a pro so I cannot provide a more detailed review on photo quality.Design wise the camera looks very very nice too bad it feels cheap real cheap. I had the white colored QX10 which looks GREAT on the new iPhone 5s gold (temporarily borrowed from a friend to see how it looked).Software is like any other camera app but you cannot save to an SD card for some reason. You can immediately share to Instagram or another photo social sharing app but that was never my intention to begin with. Software did not play nicely with the iPhone 5 so just focused on using Android.A pro of the QX10 is that it fits most phones even phablets, just do not use a case.I had trouble reconnecting my devices to the camera each time I turned it off. Sometimes the device would see the camera and automatically connect to it but most of the time I had to go through the entire set up all over again. Not worth the hassle.I gave it two days and decided to return it.Interestingly enough I was at a sony retail store and was able to play with the QX100 which was more stable and syncing worked as advertised. Photo quality was impressive and there was less lag. But the price tag was not worth it and I never really saw myself using this camera on a daily basis to justify the price tag.This camera is suited more toward hobbyist, not even your average consumer will use it too much due to the hassle of turning it on, waiting for it to connect and launching the app.My experience was a poor one but yours may be different and pleasant so ultimately decide are you the type that will use the camera on a daily basis that justifies the price or are you an impulse buyer that wants to add another unnecessary accessory to your tech collection. If that latter, do not buy since it will just gather dust.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's really a toy for people who like cameras.", "Author": "T. Hsu", "ReviewID": "R35W3JE34VDMH3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Nexus 4 phone, which has NFC.  I think QX10 works best with phones that have NFC.Initially, N4 can have wifi off, and QX10 can be completely powered off.Two emphasis:One, no need to turn on N4 wifi manually.Two, no need to turn on QX10 power manually.Just touch the back end of N4 (lower portion) on top of QX10 and hold them together still.  Do not wave either one around while it's trying to establish connection.  It won't go any faster and you risk losing connection.No need to do anything else.1. QX10 will power itself up automatically.2. N4 will turn on wifi automatically.3. N4 will start PlayMemory automatically.4. Connectivity between QX10 and PlayMemory will establish automatically and the live view will show up on N4's screen.Above 4 steps usually finish within 15 - 20 seconds.  Again, no button needs to be pressed anywhere.  No additional steps need to be done. You can start taking pictures as soon as you see the live view on N4.As much as I want the start time to be instantaneous, it is an unrealistic expectation for a device like this.  After phones become more powerful and PlayMemory is updated to be faster & more efficient, the start up time won't be comparable to a dedicated camera.  After all, it is ridiculous to expect a SUV performing like a Ferrari...ur, maybe until lamborghini builds that one.  Just think about how long your laptop takes to start up until wifi is ready for you to browse the Internet...I am taking 1 star off for not having a faster start up time.  I think it can be under 10 seconds range.When you rotate your phone, PlayMemory's live view also reorients itself.When you rotate QX10 upside down or side way, the live view on the phone will also rotate so that it displays right side up, although with a split second delay.QX10 has the \"touch-to-focus\" feature because it works well on larger phone screens.  However, I still can't get the \"touch-to-focus\" and then \"long-hold\" to take a picture.  Maybe the \"long-hold\" feature isn't there.Turn the \"Review Image\" off (in PlayMemory) if you want/like to take the next picture quickly.I take 1 star off for its sparse control features in PlayMemory.Build quality: Overall it feels high quality with nice fit & finish. I don't like the tiny flap that covers the charging port.  It's difficult to open and I am always afraid of breaking it off.Battery life: Battery life on the phone would be a bigger concern to me.  With QX10 and PlayMemory on all the time like a surveillance camera, it drains my phone battery quite quickly.Pictures quality: Its comparable to Sony point-&-shoot cameras in the $200 range.  Besides, who buys QX10 for its \"superb\" picture quality???Let's all just admit it.  It's really a toy for people who like camera.  And I think it is indeed a very good toy.------------------Update 1:-----------------After a few days of using it, I have to emphasize that if you expect it to be ready to take pictures within 2 seconds (typical of using a dedicated camera), this toy is not for you.  Even with NFC, it takes more than 15 seconds on the average to pair up.  If you leave it connected all the time, it will drain your phone battery very quickly and you won't be able use the phone for anything else because PlayMemories disconnects if you switch to another app.I only attached the lens to the phone once just to test out the attachment, which works fine and feels solid.  Besides that, the lens always stays separate from the phone because that's where the REAL fun is with this lens.Connecting thru NFC on my Nexus 4 works consistently every time.  However, my Nexus 7 failed to connect thru NFC 3 out of 10 times.  I had to look up Nexus 7 manual to figure out where is the optimal spot on the backside of Nexus 7.  It's the \"x\" of \"Nexus\" on the back.  Nexus 7's larger screen is definitely a plus with this lens.For best responsiveness in taking pictures, install a memory card on the lens and disable both \"preview\" and \"save to phone\" in PlayMemories.When transferring pictures from lens's memory card to the phone, I feel it's pretty fast considering it's going thru wifi.  If you want your pictures on the phone, I would suggest transferring them after you are done taking all the pictures.  Your picture taking experience will be much better.I tested the connectivity up to 30 feet away thru two sheetrock walls and it still works.------------------Update 2:-----------------PlayMemories was recently updated.  However, it seems to be more finicky now.  I had to force stop PlayMemories a couple of times on my N4.  I haven't experienced any improvements in the start up time.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It was a good try.", "Author": "meee", "ReviewID": "R1FQ87IDK9K8EK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So after playing with the DSC-QX10 I am returning it. I was really rooting for this to work. A few issues1. Lag - Outdoors under sunlight, indoors, an area with too many access points, outside in the city. It lags where I cannot even take the picture I want because the opportunity is gone. It tries to adjust at the cost of not being able to function at a speed a normal point and shoot can.2. Lack of flash - yes people still use this.3. Barely fits the larger Note 3 phones.4. Really? Wifi??? Sometimes if the phone is configured to connect to other pre-programmed wifi hotspot or access point, it will fight with the camera and disconnect leaving me with a \"Internet not available disconnecting\" message rendering my camera useless.5. When wanting to browse the pictures on the device (from the phone) it self that didn't download to the phone, it is difficult and would disconnect before it would allow you to do it.6. I need to disconnect the camera to post the picture directly to anything social media related. Since the phone is looking for internet and notices that the Sony camera doesn't have it, it will disconnect and then re-connect to your phone service to upload.7. By the time I get the camera ready, the opportunity is gone.8. Software that is in the camera's internal memory has nothing to do with the camera and is not compatible with the camera. Why was it included?If this product line is to survive, I suggest to Sony, use Bluetooth. Needing to disconnect from the camera to connect to 4g/LTE to post a picture is ridiculous and takes up to a minute to perform. Also, put a flash in the darn thing. I am sure they know how to do that since they also made Sony RX II with its tiny flash. A few more functions such as being able to set how long exposure time is, and better aperture control would be nice. And last, make sure it can save the pictures to another folder on the phone, lets say, the DCIM folder on the SD card on the phone maybe where the gallery program can find it and not on the phone itself under the \"Sony Memories\" folder where gallery cannot find it. I was hoping that this was my point and shoot that I would carry and use everywhere. I am resigned to the fact that I will probably need to buy a point and shoot and look back at this and say \"It was a good try\" don't get me wrong, these take very good pictures under ideal circumstances (no wifi interference, not so much light, stationary and no need to post it right away), but it didn't hit my standards.

I'm having a good experience so far. My HTC phone is great except that the built-in camera is 5MP so has always been a bummer since I like to take a lot of snaps. Enter this option. I thought about getting a regular small digital camera, but either way I'd be carrying around a second item and this device seemed more flexible for me.You first launch the play memories app and then enter a one-time pass-code to pair the lens with your phone. Then it connects via WiFi or NFC. NFC seems faster. As others have stated, it's not optimal for capturing those \"emergency\" photos due to the start-up/config that needs to occur every time you power up the lens. It's not that bad though - just don't expect to be able to capture those quick spontaneous shots. This is better for pictures with friends or landscapes, etc.Otherwise, the pictures are high quality and pretty impressive in low light conditions. The zoom is also good and it's nice that there's a wrist strap so you can tether it to yourself. Also, if you have multiple supported phones/devices, you can use this lens with any of them. The other fun option is that your phone screen/viewfinder basically becomes a remote control; meaning you can place the lens on a tripod and snap pictures from a few feet away or take more accurate self portraits since you can see exactly what you're shooting with your phone's display. Also makes for some interesting new photo perspectives.Some things to note - there's no flash and it cannot use your phone's flash. But again, low light pictures have been pretty impressive in my opinion and I'm a person who rarely uses a flash anyway. Also, you'll need to have a micro SD card inserted into the lens in order to take videos. And my card had to be formatted once inserted.So far I don't have any complaints since I knew exactly what I was getting into with this lens.

QX10 has a much better zoom than QX100", "Author": "Stephen \"radman2020\"", "ReviewID": "R1RQV6PHWGGUQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have the QX100 and Qx10 both.  Amazon is putting the reviews together so I will give the info for both in my reviews. The QX100 is bigger and has many more options.  Interestingly, the software on my phone knows the difference and the extra options on the Qx100 are just there.I use this with the Samsung Note 3.  I have a very thin phone case but the brackets are just a bit too small.  I have to take the phone out of the case and it just barely fits.  It fits fine on my Galaxy 4 however.  I do like using this without putting it on the phone.  the brackets are exactly the same for the Qx100 and QX10.This links up very quickly...a bit better with NFC however I keep NFC off to save battery.  I am fine with the WiFi.  The first time you have to read those very small wifi code letters....but it is automatic after that.The picture quality is superb....but I certainly take better pictures with my Nikon D7100.  Yes, this is smaller and works with my cell phone... but it isn't like this is small enough to put in my pants pocket like a point and shoot.  The cell phone camera may not be high quality.. but it is better quality than not having a camera at all!  The QX10/100 are both big enough and cumbersome that you just aren't going to regularly carry them in your pocket.  I tend to be satisfied with my cell phone pictures recognizing them for what they are  I am even happier quality wise with a point and shoot than my cell... and I tend to have that around more often...in a pants or jacket pocket because it is so small and convenient.  If I am going to bring more, I'd rather have my Nikon SLR... it is just more versatile... no fumbling like with these devices.Major difference between this and the Qx10?  This only has a 3.2X optical zoom.  Really?  The Qx10 has a 10x zoom!  One of the big things they talk about as an advantage of these devices is that you have optical, and not digital zoom, greatly improving image quality.  I can't for the life of me figure out why the zoom level is so modest in this more expensive and larger model.So.. fumbling.  The buttons are small.  Controlling with a touch screen is not the easiest. You have to link up.  If I have it detached from the phone, I have to worry about 2 devices.  If I have it on the phone, it is a bit cumbersome.  I can control the zoom with the lever on the barrel or the phone screen for both.  However, on the Qx10, the zoom on the barrel of the lens moves too fast to control.  The zoom is much more controlled on the virtual button on the screen.  On the QX100, you can also rotate the ring on the lens for zoom or manual focus (but not both at the same time).You can do auto intelligent program modes or aperture or shutter priority...  but it just seems awkward to do these priority modes with my phone...  just haven't done that except to try.  These modes are not available in the Qx10 and I really don't miss them.You can get to the sd slot on the QX100 without opening the battery compartment, an advantage over the Qx10 where you have to open the compartment. ..but not a big one.The lens seems vulnerable.  I can't protect if from fingerprints with a uv or sunlight filter.The software will not allow me to choose where the pictures go on my phone.  I want them in a folder with my other pictures... you may or may not...but there is no choice.  I like to save my pics to an sd card in my phone.  No option.You can shut the shutter sound off but I can't seem to keep my phone itself from beeping when I take a picture.  Annoying.No flash with this.Bottom line.. these take great pictures... but they aren't as easy to take as with my SLR which gives considerably better pictures and more control.  They are better than my very nice point and shoot camera but those pictures are still quite good and I have more control with that (and mine is waterproof!).  This really is no more convenient than the point and shoot... my point and shoot is much smaller in my pocket.If I really was going to use this, I would opt for the QX10.  Cheaper, smaller, and much better zoom...", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "PLEASE fix your App ASAP or open source it so others can fix it for you", "Author": "Bassel Ojjeh", "ReviewID": "R1BTZJRBET4R6Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sony please do me a favor and fire the product owner who was responsible for the execution of the product. how on earth could you ship such a beautiful concept with such a poor quality of integration.

I'll do my best to put as much separation between the 2 as possible.The QX10: gorgeous little piece of equipment, and takes stunning photos. The look, feel, and performance of the hardware is extraordinary, and I think Sony has really become a strong player in the world of cameras. I love the initiative taken to innovate a product that acknowledges the move to people relying more fully on smart phones for photos, but sometimes wanting to step up the game a bit, without having to lug around a full DSLR camera. Yes, we are doing the dreaded \"extra device\" thing, but the extra device is small, convenient, powerful, and worthwhile. The BIG set-back with the camera is that Sony somehow (stupidly) chose  to force users to make a WIFI connection to the camera, rather than Bluetooth. My understanding is that Android users have a more automatic connection with the wifi setting, but let's acknowledge that there is a huge iPhone user-base here, too. Bluetooth would make for a fast, easy, no-extra-steps connection, and I am endlessly frustrated by the wifi setting.The App: Dreadful, disfunctional, and not being improved fast enough or well enough. This is a sad story. The promise that is advertised for using the app with the camera is not the reality AT ALL. Just read through the app reviews! It is slow, and your photography experience becomes a nightmare of lagging, freezing, restarting, re-installing, and screaming. It will also drain an iPhone battery in record time. I spent hours on the phone with their support team, and have learned that the app particularly dislikes the iPhone 5, running iOS 7. The app could also clearly have more (obvious) features, such as different scene/shutter settings. The settings menu is very limited.Camera 360 has integrated a Sony QX10/100 compatibility in their app (3rd party developers are open to integration with the camera). I'm glad to see that someone has at least come on board in that arena, but they offer even less usability functions (not even a tap-to-focus option?), and it has trouble connecting with the hardware. Hoping for more (and better) 3rd party app compatibility in the future.Overall summary: If you are a casual photographer, and a patient person, the camera is fun, and takes great photos. You cannot rapid-fire shoot, and may have to spend 10 seconds or more trying to get each shot (Nature scene? Cool. Kids and dogs? Good luck!)

Sony mount worked good on S3, but will not fit on Tab2.  I thought I read somewhere the mount would stretch 5\".  Guess not, but will function as a remote tripod camera, if needed.  Camera functions worked as expected.  WiFi synced up on both units, but found the start-up slow ~20 seconds.  Not good for catching the moment. One short coming I found was the ability to review images on the fly.  Unlike a smartphone or camera, you cannot replay on demand images freshly shot.  You have to download the images or video files from the QX10 (microSD card) and then view them on your smartphone, tab or PC.  Thats OK, I guess, for post processing.  But if you need to instantly check your shot, you will have to bracked may pics to make sure you're on target.  Video files are in MP4 format.  I found my S3 unable to replay them, but the Tab2 performed as expected.  You can also view and replay videos on a PC using Sony's PlayMemories Home app.  Overall I have mixed emotions on its uses, for me personally.

It had previously worked for me on an iPad 4 with iOS7.  This lens is great fun and takes great photos.  It is an amazing leap in quality over iPhone photos.  It comes with a device to \"attach\" it to your iPhone (and other similar-sized phones), but I never use it.  I can hold the lens in one hand and the phone in the other.  This gives you many more position options.  You can hold the lens high and still see what you are looking at on the phone.  Do NOT expect this to be a convenient replacement for a small camera or even for the convenience of a smartphone camera.  This lens has a 10X optical lens and takes great low-light shots, but it does take something under a minute to set up (turn on lens wireless and connect to an iPhone).  But if you've got 45 seconds to set up, want higher quality photos, want a 10X optical zoom, and like to be able to use your maximum reach to get over heads, see into tight spots, etc. then this is great fun.  Note that the DSC-QX100 specs are be even better, but it does NOT have the 10X optical.  A micro card on the camera holds the photos and 1080 30/fps video but also sends a smaller version of photos to your iPhone for immediate sharing.  A USB cord is provided to connect to your computer for charging and to transfer files. The battery is removable if you want to carry a spare or two.  This is one of those devices where your imagination can make it extremely useful.  Easy to take \"selfies\" or group shots with everyone in it; just set the lens wherever, zoom to frame up, and shoot.  I use it at Board meetings to place up by a presenter for shots or video while I control it from my iPad from the other side of the room.

I also liked the idea that it was compact and had zoom capability so I wouldn't have to carry around a full size camera all the time. I'm not as enthusiastic about this purchase as I was when looking at reviews and all the pictures on line of this item. The image quality is ok, but not that great. You can't really adjust the settings to make the images look better. The wireles connection is tricky. Every time you want to use it, it has to use your phone's wireless connection. This means is you are using wireless internet on your phone, you will only be able to use cellular data while using this lens. You'd think this wouldn't be too much of an issue, but any time your phone uses cellular data you run the risk of using too much and getting charged extra. As I'm constantly getting emails and using my phone to stream music, this was a problem for me. Also, it is very easy to accidentally turn the camera off, and the application you use on your phone seems to constantly have issue.

I like how my phone interfaces with Facebook, Instagram and all the chat apps. The only thing that I need on top of that is better shots for low light, night scene and some zoom. I definitely do not want to buy an SLR; I wouldn't know how to use it and I really don't want to be hauling such a big equipment around.The QX 100 is small enough that I can put into my purse and it takes beautiful pictures at most lighting environment. The first thing that I did after I received it is to download the version 3 software. The unit doesn't come with a charger, just an USB cable. I just used my iPhone charger which works out just fine.My experience with the camera so far has been pretty good. I tried it out with the iPhone 4S and also Nexus 5. Based on other reviews, I was expecting the interface with the iPhone 4s would be buggy and lagging. I am still on IOS 5. However, to my surprise, the iPhone 4s interface has been working out better than the Nexus 5. The Wi-Fi connection with the iPhone 4s has been solid. The iPhone has always detected the camera and it has never crashed once. On the other hand, both the NFC and Wi-Fi connection for the Nexus 5 have some intermittent problems. 30% of the time, the N5 cannot detect the camera or it'll declare an error. I had to power off the QX 100 and try again. For both the N5 and iPhone 4s, there is only minimal lag in the display. It does take some time after each picture for the image to be saved to the phone and the SD card. It is ok for me since if I want the image on the phone, either I save it right away or I have to do it later.The QX 100 is not light weight; it can get a little front heavy when it is attached to the phone. I was holding the camera instead of the phone and my hand gets a little tired after prolonged use. I found the quickest way for me to detach and reattach the camera to the phone is simply leave that the attachment ring on the phone and it is easy to snap the camera on and off to the ring.The Sony play memories is very basic and needs some improvement. I would like to see the software adds a function to use the phone's  flash. Even though the camera does take really good pictures at low light without the flash, the flash can come handy sometimes when you just need a little light sauce. It will also be nice if the SW can incorporate some features of other popular phone camera apps.Overall, I am happy with the QX100 so far.

However, its live view capabilities are weak. The Sony Playmemories Mobile software is required to control the lens with the phone. It's on Google Play so no problem there. The problems start when you try to take a picture. First, the live view lag is awful. Couple that lag with a not very speedy auto focus and it's just about impossible to take a picture of anything that can move, even slightly. It's incredibly frustrating. My Nexus 5 is no slouch when it comes to speed. But the lens is almost unusable when paired with it.The zoom is nice. However, again, the lag makes it hard to use. Then there is lighting. Because the QX10 does not use the Nexus 5's flash, it's actually less useful than than the 5's built in camera.

It was on the instruction manual and I lost the manual somehow.  This is unusual for me, but, it happened.

The camera doesn't come with a memory card or stick, so you'll need to supply your own. The quick start guide is pretty simple to follow, and after downloading the Android app, I was up and running very quickly. It didn't take long for me to be seriously disappointed. First, when paired with the phone, there is a serious lag issue, and the camera controls are very slow. The camera does seem to focus fairly quickly, but there are constant pauses and delays when taking pictures. The refresh time between pictures is also very slow. The on screen control to adjust the zoom is almost unusable due to response delay. Using the hardware zoom control solves this problem, but the screen still lags and pauses. The ergonomics of the camera when attached to the phone are awful. It feels unbalanced, and you have to reach blindly for the hardware controls because they aren't visible when trying to look at the screen and take a picture. I took dozens of pictures and some video under various conditions, then headed home to view my results on a large monitor. This is when I found another inconvenience. I removed the camera from my phone, and I was like: \"what do I do with the camera now\"? It's too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. The only option was for me to carry it around with the wrist strap. After getting home and downloading the pictures to my PC, as expected all my indoor results are very poor. The camera has no flash capabilities, and even pictures with decent indoor lighting came out very poor. At best they came out grainy and full of noise. At worst, they were a blurred mess. The camera is useless in anything other than good outdoor lighting. On the positive side, my outdoor results were quit good. They were on par with a decent point and shoot camera. The video was good too. Even with a few positives, I see no reason to ever want to use the Sony DSC-QX10 again. Other than the 10x zoom, it offers no advantage to my phone's decent camera. For less money, I could buy a decent 10X zoom pocket camera with WiFi capabilities that takes better pictures, and can be used in all lighting conditions. When I'm done using it, I can put both it and my pocket. I really can't recommend the Sony DSC-QX10. It's overall poor performance, inconveniences, and price, outweigh the few positive things about it.Pros:Good image results when used in good lighting.Good video quality outdoors.10X Zoom/Wide Angle Lens.Easily connects to your mobile device.Good for sharing pictures via social media from your phone.Cons:No flash. Useless indoors.Awful ergonomics.Slow performance, terrible lag, and constant pauses.No internal memory or SD card included.Expensive for what it does.Mobile application is very basic.Note: My review is for the \"point and shoot\" model QX10.

I want to love this lens so much, but there are two major strikes against it that make it a very risky purchase in my opinion.I'll start with the obvious: No flash. Not only does this lens not have a flash (which I guess is understandable), there's no way to connect a flash to it at all. You can't use the iPhone's flash and you can't connect an external flash. That's really a shame. And even though the lens does well in low light, it still doesn't make sense to me to spend nearly $500 on a lens that you can't use at night.My second gripe is potentially even worse: No network configuration. This will take a little longer to explain, but the important thing to know is that if you lose the little slip of paper with the wi-fi SSID and password, you have a $500 paperweight on your hands.Here's why the network configuration is important...This lens isn't really just a lens, it's actually a full camera, except without an LCD or a body. At first I wasn't sure how this was going to connect to my iPhone. I figured that it would either sit in front of the iPhone's lens or maybe connect to the phone with a cable. But the lens actually has enough software inside to actually have a little web server and antenna inside. So the lens broadcasts a wi-fi signal and you have to \"join\" this network with your phone. You turn on the lens, you go into your phone's wi-fi settings and join that network, and then you use the app on your phone to control the lens and transfer the images via wi-fi. That's great, but there's no way to go into the settings and change the wi-fi password to something you can remember. So if you ever lose the default password that came with it, you're sunk.Beyond that, I really like the lens and I haven't even had some of the problems with lag that other people complain about. It's a great lens, but it's too much of a risk for me for that much money._______________EDIT:A friend set me straight on the SSID / password issue. It turns out that the SSID & password are printed on a label on the inside of the battery cover. That's pretty swell, except that it kind of defeats the purpose of having a password if you're going to print it on a label (Security 101 tells us not to write down our passwords). Seriously though, that's reassuring to me, because I was kind of panicked that I was going to lose this password and it was going to take me hiring a hypnotist to help me remember what it was._______________EDIT #2:I used this lens quite a bit more over the weekend at a big family gathering.  I found the the more I used it, the less I liked it.  It was really hard to be spontaneous and just take a picture.  I had to either leave it powered on all the time or anticipate what was going to happen and give myself enough time to boot it up and pair my phone (about 90 seconds).  I almost missed the chance to get a picture of my aunt blowing out the candles on her 80th birthday cake.  It was tricky to move around and zoom in and out to get the right shot when people were talking or moving.  If people posed, then it was pretty simple.  For the spontaneous pictures I figured out that it was faster to use the zoom ring on the lens.  Same with actually taking the picture:  It was easier to snap the photo using the button on the lens.Conclusion:  This camera takes some amazing pictures, but it's not very practical at all (especially for the price).

Disappointment is what ensued...  The following are the devices I tested with and the results of the same.First off, the box includes the camera, battery, micro-usb cable, hand strap, plastic spring loaded cover to attach to mobile device, and documentation.  A micro-sd card, which is almost necessary to use this camera was NOT included..luckily I had an extra.Test devices: Apple iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and Macbook Pro.How does it work? : Simply put the camera has wi-fi built in with its own network.  You simply attach your mobile device to the camera's wi-fi and use a proprietary application by Sony to take pictures.  The application is free and available for both Android and iOS...it is called PlayMemories Mobile.Scenario One: iPhone 5s.I charged the camera for a full overnight before I began the testing process.  I attached the included spring loaded cover which as two latches so you can attach it to your mobile device (see pictures).  I turned the camera on and following the simple documentation I had my iPhone join the wireless network it created.  The wi-fi name and password are printed on the inside of the battery cover as well as on the quick start guide.  Once joined, I used the PlayMemories application and began to take pictures.  Wonderful experience - it worked as it should and the pictures were clear and sharp.  The camera stores a high resolution image on the micro-sd card which you supply and a lower resolution image on your iPhone so you can share it immediately with the likes of Facebook, etc.  The image, once taken, takes about 1+ second to process and save on your mobile device..which is not bad all things considered.  The high resolution images can be taken off of the camera by attaching it to your computer with the included micro-usb cable or by removing the memory card and inserting into your card reader.  Voila, I figured Sony had come up with the perfect solution to ditching a high end point and shoot camera (which I still use because for me the iPhone 5s leaves a bit to be desired in the camera department).  Not so fast....  One of the functions of the camera is to be able to be detached from the mobile device so you can put it in tight spaces and use the phone as a viewfinder to take pictures.  I simply detached the camera, put it about 2-3 feet from my iPhone and noticed nothing but a slow choppy viewfinder...dysfunctional in my opinion.  I gave the camera the benefit of the doubt as it can still take pictures without a viewfinder....simply point the camera towards the object, press a onboard shutter button half way, wait for an audible beep (indicating focus has been achieved) and then press fully...the picture is taken, stored on the memory card, and sent to the phone.  It works...but you cannot see what you are shooting due to the LAG between the phone and the camera.  Disappointing.Scenario Two: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.Most of the experiences here were the same as scenario one so I will not repeat the verbiage.  There is only one benefit to using this device with the Note 3 which has built in NFC.  I first joined the wi-fi network from my Note 3 to pair the camera and the device.  I already had downloaded PlayMemories on my Android phone.  Once paired I did the same tests as in scenario one with the same exact results.  The one thing that stood out in this testing was that NFC made pairing the camera a bit easier...(NFC=near field communication).  Basically you pair the camera the first time by entering the password...but every other time you want to use the camera with your NFC phone, simply turn it on and tap it towards the phone...this initiates a quick connection to the built in wi-fi and you can start shooting.  Naturally, this would be a great feature on the iPhone...but alas we will have to wait for Apple to implement NFC.A Note About Wi-Fi - Both the iPhone and the Android device were set to automatically join wireless networks...this becomes a pain if you turn your camera off, because your mobile device will join your home/office/etc wi-fi and you will lose connection to the camera.  You have to rejoin the built in network....(again, this is easier on Android with NFC since it requires a tap to the device).  I did have to turn off some advanced wi-fi functionality on my Android so it did not consider the camera a weak connection.Battery Life: The battery seems to charge quickly and its level can be checked via a small onboard lcd window.  I was not able to drain it completely, although after sitting on a table for 2 nights the battery was completely dead and needed to be recharged.Pictures-Image Quality-Low Light:This is where I give this camera the 2 stars that I have for my review.  The image quality was excellent for all pictures taken with either mobile device.  Realize that using a flash is not an option here.  My testing was first done on a bright sunny day and then on a clear night inside our home with some regular lighting.  The image quality was excellent....just as good as a point and shoot would provide for me.  The camera has a 10x optical zoom, which in my opinion is perfect for daily shooting while out and about with the family....its not the best you can get but for this size it is pretty awesome.  Focusing with the camera can be done in two ways...one is by depressing the on board shutter switch half way and the other being you can tap your screen on your mobile device (as you would when using your phones camera).  It also has video modes which I did not test...for me it was all about still pictures.A note about low light, specifically:  While I did not attempt to test this camera in a candle lit setting, I can tell you that its low light performance is more than adequate.  We used it in our family room where we turned the lights off....we had some light coming in from the kitchen...if I were to measure I would say it was about the same amount of light a 10watt bulb would provide...  The pictures were excellent.I think this is a great device which takes excellent pictures.  The design of the hardware along with the functionality it offers is AMAZING.....  I however think that the execution of the linking process to the mobile phone is somewhat flawed (unless you have NFC).  I also did not like the LAG factor when using the camera detached from the phone at about 2-4 feet.I am sure that Sony can and will improve this with firmware updates and hopefully with hardware revisions to the product.  Until then I rate this a 2.5 out of 5....but since I cannot select half stars it will get the lower end...2 out of 5.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "As advertised and hooks right up", "Author": "Dr. Roger L.

It makes it possible to take higher quality photos without having to lug around a giant extra camera when we're out and about.Pros:*The photo quality is much better than the lens on my camera phone.*The 10x zoom lets you take quality photos that aren't grainy or pixilated (when I try to take zoomed in photos on my smartphone the quality is AWFUL).*It's compact and can easily be stowed in a pocket or a purse.*I like that it's possible to attach the camera directly to the smartphone via an adapter (but there can be issues with that as well - see the cons below).*It's possible to use a micro SD to store the photos on the camera, so you can get the storage that you desire.*You can use a USB cord to connect and upload your camera to your computer.*It's easy to share photos on social media directly from the Sony app.*Preview photos are saved to your smart phone.Cons:*I have a larger smartphone (A Samsung Galaxy S4) that I keep in a protective otterbox case. When I attempt to attach the camera to the phone, it's a bit of a stretch to get it to fit. It will snap onto the case, but it is super duper tight (I was almost nervous that I was going to break the connector). I did try to attach it to my mom's iphone 5 in a protective case and it fit without any problems. Just a heads up if you have a larger smart phone in a protective case.*I kept wanting to turn it off after I took a picture, in order to conserve the battery, but every time you turn it off it has to reconnect to your phone's wireless and app. It can be a bit of an inconvenience if you want to quickly take a picture. If you're wanting to take a picture quickly, I suggest leaving the camera on and connected to your phone.*In order to connect to your camera, it disconnects you from your wireless internet connection. So, while you are connected to the camera, you do not have access to your online features. (You just have to disconnect the camera and it will automatically reconnect.)*There is no internal storage.*I really wish there was some sort of flash option. It takes fair photos in dim light, but it would be nice if it could somehow have a small built-in flash or if it could utilize the smart phone's built in flash capabilities.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect to Take Mobile Photography to the Next Level", "Author": "Kirsten Mitson \"www.visible-images.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3FIGHGACYHII1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For mobile enthusiasts this takes photography with a smartphone to the next level. With ability to control aperture from f/1.8 to 11 manually, as well as exposure, and the ability to save a full size image on the memory card while simultaneously saving a shareable size image to the smartphone device that is attached, this nearly makes a dSLR pointless if you're a hobbyist photographer only and not needing to sell or supply images at a professional level. Even for those who do, this is still a device that will have a place in any gear bag.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "QX10 Review... nice little device for the novice.", "Author": "Ninjaba \"Ninjaba\"", "ReviewID": "R1WIEA3HRFEGYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the QX10 for over a month now and I'm quite impressed. Overall this is a fun little product that makes picture taking with a camera a little more exciting. That doesn't mean there's downsides, I'll get to those later.Basically this is a Lens camera, meaning it's a camera without a body! You can zoom and take pictures just with the lens itself, the problem is you can't see what you're taking pictures of so you'll need your smartphone. There's a little setup time required before you can use the device. Sony's Lens uses WiFi to connect with your phone. I'm so with everyone else who wonders why Bluetooth wasn't used here (major downside). This constant back and forth with the WiFi connection in order to use the camera and then have access to your phone is annoying. You pretty much have to decide you're just taking pictures right now so focus on that, then switch back to WiFi to check emails and such later when you're done.Lens attaches to phone with retractible clips on the camera and fits fine with iPhone 4 and Otterbox case.Zoom, ISO settings, white balance, touch screen where you want the camera to focus, timer, and a few other camera controls are all on your phone screen, as well as the shutter button. No aperture of shutter speed controls -- I totally expect Sony to come out with this version at a later date (maybe they already have and I missed it on a newer more expensive model).Definitely should get a micro SD card (not included) to use this camera. Video will only record if you have an SD card, and if you're like me and have low memory on your phone (16GB), you'll need an SD card. High resolution pictures are saved to your card and can be transferred to your phone (note: the transfer rate is slow). Still, I prefer keeping my pictures and videos on my card and inserting it into my computer to download.One cool thing about this lens is it has a tripod connection. You can set the camera up somewhere and use your phone from another location to take pictures and videos... within WiFi range.I think for novice use this is a fun little gadget. Since the purpose is picture taking the pictures are quite nice! Much better than the pictures I get on my phone, and much better than the Panasonic camera I own. The big downside is it's a bit slow, nothing too crazy (except sometimes when you're trying to get it to connect), but there is a little lag time, not something you would get with a regular camera. Still, it's a pretty cool device that I imagine is the wave of the future and will come down in price eventually.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "At first glance, meh, but after use this item is terrific", "Author": "Narut Ujnat \"Enthusiasm is contagious.\"", "ReviewID": "R2S4FUD4GWG65C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was given the chance to review this item based on my interest in photography and technology.  This item is essentially a camera that allows communications with a smartphone through an app.  As a Iphone user, one of the complaints I certainly have is the rather weak camera (Nokia in comparison has a phone with 40 MP available).  This, of course is rather disappointing.  This device attempts to fill this rather large niche with some interesting results.1.  What's in the box?:  You receive the camera, plus a strap, a small instruction booklet, and a 'back' piece as well.2.  Aesthetic?:  I received the white QX-10 version which is white.  The lens itself is about a handful (with a man's palm) and relatively small (about 2 1/4 inches diameter and perhaps just 2 inches deep).  The lens is quite nicely made, with a nice gold face unit which makes this look very nice.  In addition, the plastic is substantial and this feels like a quality item.3.  Use?:  It is my practice to try tech items without instructions because I like to see whether a device can be used by intuition.  Here, the first thing that needs to be done is to put the back piece on.  This was not easy at first, but being delicate, this item just twists into place.  Be sure NOT to really manhandle this as not much pressure is actually needed.  The backpiece goes over the battery compartment (charged with a micro-USB cable (included charger) and the same compartment covers the micro-SD card holder at the top of the ring.Once the lens is charged (via USB) and you are ready to go, this item is interesting.  The backpiece not only covers the back, but it has two brackets you can pull out to place this directly on the phone (these open like an accordion).  Now, the user will need to download the Sony Playmemories app depending on the device (IOS or Android) to accommodate the lens.  Once you download this app, you can use the camera by turning it on and setting up a connection via WiFi as a private network.  Once this is done, the camera is ready to go.Pictures/Video?:  If you do not put in a Micro-SD card, this device will upload pictures to your phone directly. However, to really take advantage of the camera, you can opt (via the app) to have the device store items on the memory card.  My first impressions of the lens are being impressed with the lens/sensor.  The pictures are really quite impressive and far better that the Iphone lens for sure.  When downloaded via the memory card, the sensor really becomes impressive.  The detail and light are really quite good.App:  One thing that becomes clear is the lens is not to be used simply as a rapid response camera.  The lens has to be turned on, the wifi network needs to be synced (not a simple operation at home with a home network being first choice) and then the camera must sync with the network.  So, if you suddenly see a meteor coming at you, this ain't the device that will provide evidence of that happening.  But, in more prepared situations, this lens is really quite excellent to have around.Cons:  The lens is not a easily portable item having attached to the phone as it is a bit ungainly.  Also, every time a picture is taken, there is a slight lag due to the storage of the picture on either the phone or card.  Using the app, you can change these features around (having the pictures sent to the card does cut down, but not eliminate this lag.  Thee consequence of this is that you cannot take rapid pictures of something moving.  Although you can easily switch to video I guess to accomplish this.The app is quite nice, and allows the user to make changes to the lens quite easily.  The wifi range is not great.  So while you can certainly place the lens off the phone, you can't go very far without the app dropping the connection.Overall:  At first, I thought this lens was unnecessary and ungainly.  However, once I set this up, and started taking pictures, I realized that this lens is really useful.  The pictures are really quite impressive for this type of lens.This is not a DSLR replacement, and this would probably not be my first choice to pick up for such an opportunity.  But, for taking pictures in places where you know you need something portable and with a good sensor, this is a pretty darn good choice.  Since so much of the usefulness will reply on the app, I certainly hope that Sony will continue to work on eliminating some of the kinks (I have not found bugs by the way) from this lens.I highly recommend getting the lens cover by the way.A very good item that has grown on me in the time I have used it, I certainly carry this around quite a bit and I already have taken some really great pictures.

I see it more applicable for DSLR users who don't want to take their full kit everywhere they go. This allows these people the ability to take decent photos and video (sans sound) wherever they take their smartphone or portable device.I get what Sony is attempting to do with this camera and think that it is a great idea. They are taking an excellent camera core and letting the user use his/her mobile device as the display. The lens and sensor are outstanding and capable of high quality images and video. However, for this to work better, it could use some additional features. One, it should flash or otherwise light the scene somehow. Two, it should save raw files to flash memory, maybe leaving lower quality JPEGs for quick syncing. Three, it needs to record sound with video. Even basic sound is better than silent video and remotely locating the lens and sound recorder can lead to interesting possibilities. Four, Sony's developers should focus on developing manual control and maybe reducing control times (lag is noticeable at times). Finally, there should be a threaded mount for attaching filters.In its current configuration, since it does not have a built-in flash, one can enable a flashlight app and get illuminated photos or simply rely on the fast lens speed. f1.8 is very fast, although this is not constant aperture.

It also worked on a Samsung Galaxy 2 with slim case.  The clamp holds on to just the edges so you don't have to be worrying about damaging your phone's screen.The app was easy to find.  There is a one time set up required for the wireless connection.  After that it fires up automatically when the device is on and the app is launched.  The camera is full auto.  It will auto focus (ie switch to macro as needed) but the only user settings are the choice of stills or video and zooming in or out.  My camera in my phone has multiple modes and a panorama option- all of which are lost by using this external camera.  My phone already zooms to 4x so the 10x of the Sony lens is nice but I'm not sure it makes up for all the other stuff I lose.  Too bad the Sony doesn't run off the built in camera app so I could have my cake and photograph it too....The one totally cool thing about the device is that it does not have to be clamped to the camera to work.  Let's say you've hiked to the foot of a gorgeous waterfall, a hand held selfie just won't cut it and you don't want to play the self timer game.  You can prop the Sony on a rock, pose in front of the waterfall and use your phone as a remote to compose and take the photo, provided you stay within whatever is the range of the wireless.I have mixed emotions about this gizmo.  Yes it works, was easy to set up and use and it takes good pictures.  But it is too bulky to leave attached to the phone so there is considerable delay before you're ready to shoot a picture, I'd never trust the clamp to use the carry strap with the phone attached and I lose all the \"modes and functionality of the phone's built in camera.  I guess if you are really concerned about photo quality, consistently take photos of distant, FIXED objects where you have plenty of time to set up your shot, and wear clothes with giant pockets, this might be something you'd want to purchase.  Anytime you try and cram multiple functions into a single device, there are sacrifices to be made.  Personally, I'd rather carry a phone in one pocket and a real camera in the other one.

The set up is very easy after you download the app. It is it's own wifi transmitter & it works very well. The only drawback is that you do have to go to settings on your phone & switch to the camera's wifi. It doesn't do it automatically. A minor inconvenience.

But it just doesn't cut it.First off, the idea is good... A high quality camera in a very small package that uses the processing power and LCD of your smart phone. This is not an add on lens for your phone's camera.  It's a camera without the LCD and computer section that use an app on your phone to take pictures. In fact the camera doesn't need to be attached to the phone, it can sit on a tripod and be controlled by the phone. The DSC-QX10/B  appears to be very well made. It features a 10X optical zoom lens that does take very good photos. Zooming is done in steps and it slow compared to today's point and shoot cameras. It has its own rechargeable battery and takes micro SD cards (not supplied) to store the photos.  The camera acts as a WiFi access point... you connect your phone to it like any WiFi network. Installing the app on the phone was easy and uneventful.Upon using the camera and phone combination I got frustrated real fast.  When trying to follow a moving object, the image on the phone would freeze up constantly for a second or two at a time. When it did work, zooming the lens was slow, very slow.  Also, the camera didn't seem to be able to  focus on moving objects. It focused well on still subjects, but still as the screen freezing up as I zoomed the lens.

Each photo has comments. You may have to copy and paste link.I normally use a Nikon D7100. I sell my photos and have a website ( you can enter kathiissermanphotos into the search engine to find it) so you can see my experience. I have never owned a Sony camera. I am reviewing this as a smartphone attachable lens. I do not compare to a DSLR or point and shoot. While I am sure Sony wants you to buy it so that you can use this as your main camera( the steep price assumes this), if you are serious about photography, purchase a compact advance point and shoot or DSLR instead. The small price jump to a camera that is intended for serious photographers is worth it.  With that said, I list below some excellent qualities for this type of camera.I really like this lens because:It is small and can easily fit in a purse. Bought these accessories http://www.amazon.com/Accessories-Cyber-shot-Smartphone-Attachable-Replacement/dp/B00FM5PJEU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1393697148&sr;=8-6&keywords;=sony+qx100+kit for a more enjoyable experience. This bundle cost $15.95It attaches easily onto a smartphone like the iPhone 4SThe photos are far superior to a smartphonethe photos are sharp, and the close ups have bokeh(a soft, blurred background)Superior auto intelligence knows when to bump the ISO, aperture or shutter. For example, the shots from a moving car bumped up the shutter speed, the close ups had a wider aperture for more light and lower ISO at times and higher ISO at other times depending on the light. Outside shots when focusing at the furthest point had a low ISOThe photos at 20mp can be blown up quite large. Use 3:2 ratio when setting up to get max pixels.Easy to begin using the settings without a manual if you have experience with camera menus.Can move the focus around to select focal point. Not intuitive. I had to guess how to do, and guessed correctly. You drag the focus which is under the camera setting on the left.I can take it anywhere because of its compactness so will always have a camera.Can shoot attached to the phone or detached. The small tripod I got was used for the tabby cat on the sofa photo. Very versatileCan hold the lens in places where a camera cannot be held when detached like face down on a bouquet of flowers, out a side car window without twisting the body...1.8 is a very wide aperture that can be used in lowlight conditions, and this lens performed very well in low light. No discernible noise seen in Photoshop or Apple Aperture with 800 ISO either. That is impressive for a compact camera, let alone a smartphone lens.What I did not like:It was difficult to judge close up distance so some photos were blurredThe landscape shots only once went to an aperture of 7.1. Most were 5.6 in superior auto intelligence even in sunny conditions.The camera did not have a manual, and I searched for awhile to find it.When I got the manual, I finally discovered that in program only you can change the white balance although auto is fairly accurate even in artificial light.It is very expensiveCan easily create a crooked photo when holding the lens as it is a barrel onlyThe first charge of the battery created only 60 shots, but I was changing the menu selections and setting up. I will have to experiment more. My accessory bundle had another battery. Good purchase as it does not warn you when the battery dies. It shuts off and you cannot turn on.Many others have pointed out that the compact camera Sony RX100M ll has the same lens. It costs $698. Buy that instead if you are spending the money to get an excellent camera.If you want to purchase this for its intended use, which I list many above, then it is a fine buy.I give it a deduction of one star because of price, otherwise it is incomparable for what it is- an attachable smartphone lens.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Interesting concept with potential - but it's not for everyone", "Author": "Lon J.

Amazon has mixed the two models into a single page so the reviews are mashed up.One of the things I admire about Sony is that they have the ability to experiment with new concepts and rapidly bring them to market. This is most certainly one of those experimental products.Think of the QX-10 as a disembodied camera. Your smartphone becomes the brains, with Sony providing the lens and sensor in a small compact unit.  The device can attach to a smart phone or can be held separately (or even mounted on a tripod). This concept brings some interesting creative possibilities, given the lens can be put in places separate from the 'viewfinder' on the smartphone.On board is an 18 megapixel sensor that delivers image quality on par with other cameras at this price point. The lens can also capture video at 1440 x 1080.The smartphone interfaces with the camera via WiFi. The Wifi has a password and it's printed on the quicks start guide that comes with the camera. It will be easily lost so I suggest storing the manual in a safe place. When connected to the camera the phone is unable to access other WiFi networks, so users of iPod Touches or other devices that don't have a secondary internet connection will be unable to go online when using the camera.A memory card slot takes M2 cards or standard MicroSD cards.  The default behavior is for full res images to be copied to the memory card while smaller low resolution images are sent back to the phone via WiFi.  It's possible to copy the full res images back to the phone with each shot, but that slows down the process considerably as another photo cannot be taken while it's copying an active image over.  It's also possible to grab the full res images from a copy function built into the app.My two biggest gripes are the following:1.  No manual controls for the camera - only ISO and exposure level can be adjusted.2.  Slow operating speeds - there's a lot of complexity going on here with Wifi connections, apps, etc. So the workflow doesn't feel as smooth as a dedicated point and shoot camera or even the phone's internal camera app.A lot can be improved in software and Sony does have a ways to go to make this feel less 'beta.'  But I'm excited to see what they do with it moving forward and look forward to revising my review.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "hassan qassab", "ReviewID": "R3TZB2SQWM6PG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The lens replaced my carry-on camera , and it's more convenient than the regular camera.I would suggest that sony improve the sony memories app.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cool addition", "Author": "Don G Lyle", "ReviewID": "RUZZR00KAZUPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This lens works with my Samsung Galaxy S2 with the standard battery pack, but doesn't clamp with bulkier extended-life battery pack or with Nexus 7 tablet.

While in use it replaces your smart phone's camera, and it does so well.  Sort of.Using a special app you download to your phone, you use the phone's screen to operate the camera, i.e., to see what it's pointing at and to make changes such as the zoom level.  The CMOS is 18 megapixels, which should be enough to meet most uses.  There's a 10X optical zoom (from 4.45 mm to 44.5 mm), and there are a standard tripod mount and image stabilization.  It shoots video as well as still pictures, at up to 1920 by 1080 in the MP4 format.  It uses a micro USB cable (supplied) to charge the rechargeable battery (supplied).  It pretty much also demands you insert a micro SD card (not supplied) in it.***The device does not have a flash, and it disables the flash on your phone, which means you have to rely on other lighting to get the shots or the video you want.  This is a problem worthy of the loss of one star from five.It takes a long time from when you see the extra-terrestrials landing on that cornfield till when you can start recording the scene.  Locate the device under review, separate it from whatever packaging it's in, attach it to your phone, go through the steps to start the app and connect the phone to the camera, and wait.  Then take a picture.  Wait, then tell it to zoom in, then wait for it to do so.  Take a second picture, but by this time, of course, the aliens are gone.Using just your phone you locate it and turn it on, hit the camera icon, and shoot a picture.  You zoom in, and before your fingers are off the screen the lens has adjusted.  You take a second picture.  Because it took less time with your phone than with the Sony DSC-QX10/W Smartphone Attachable 4.45-44.5mm Lens-Style Camera, you are now the proud owner of two images of aliens landing in and taking off from a cornfield.  They might not be at 18 megapixels or 12 or even 6 but they are OK.  And the second one might be zoomed digitally instead of mechanically, but it is still OK.  And you were able to get them both in time, with flash.***The app for the product under review does let you display your masterpieces of photographic art via social media such as AOL IMs I think.  It does not use VHS tape (not supplied).  It does not need constant oiling (oil not supplied), and there's no filter (filter not supplied) to change every six months.  It is gluten-free and contains no trans-fats.  No animals were harmed in the testing of this product.The TSA at U.S. airports might ask you to prove the device works, i.e., that it is not a hollowed-out bomb or something, and here's the problem.  As mentioned before, it takes a long time from when you start to prove it to when you can finish proving it by taking a picture.  In this case to prove it works you will be holding up the line for a matter of a minute at least, and likely more unless everything goes well.  For this lag time between wanting to take a picture and taking it I subtract another star.***I am impressed with the quality of the images this camera, with its 18-megapixel resolution and optical zooming, takes under good circumstances.  The problem is that those circumstances don't come up all that often.Also, it does not work under water for more than a few seconds, but you probably knew that.  This also voids the warranty, but you probably knew that.  The lesson is to not admit your drunk uncle dunked the camera into your aquarium \"just to see what it looks like from their point of view,\" but you probably knew that.Five stars minus one for no flash minus one for various forms of lag time equals three stars.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little toy; with very good image qaulity, software not so great", "Author": "Michael Cox \"Audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "R2F4BIAT3DATBR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera, in spite of the award software.

But once you start using it, all the problems appear.Major issues:1) There's a fraction of a second of lag from what the camera sees to what the phone display shows. It's not huge, but definitely noticeable.2) Shake reduction is almost non-existent. I had to keep my hands perfectly still to take crisp pictures. It gets exponentially worse as you start zooming in.3) The autofocus function (by touching the phone screen) is finicky. Often you have to touch it several times to get it to focus the way you want.4) It takes ~5-7 seconds to power on the camera. It's not like a regular camera where you press a power button and you are instantly ready to shoot. It takes a long time for the phone to load the software and then speak to the camera via wifi to connect with it. This becomes very annoying, especially If there's any quick action that you need to capture, the opportunity will be gone.5) Under low light conditions, the image quality was not even close to my Nexus 5 phone camera.6) Everyone once in a while, the image on my phone freezes for a good 10 seconds before it regains control again. This has happened 3 times in just the 1st 30 minutes of testing.7) From an amateur's perspective (without going into any fine details), the overall image quality did not seem noticeably better than my regular phone camera. It does produce better depth of field at close ranges due to it's larger aperture. But that was about it for me.I am a huge fan of Sony products. They make some of the best point-and-shoot cameras in the market. But I am disappointed at this half baked product. This is short of just attaching an expensive zoom feature to your existing phone camera. I was thrilled about this product when it was first announced last year. And I'd consider it to be one of the top gadget innovations of 2013. But sadly, I would not consider this acceptable for consumer use.This is just another good example of what happens when a genius Program Manager decides to launch a half baked product to meet a target deadline... \"Hey! Let's shoot the engineers and begin production!\".  Hope they learn and do not make the same mistake again.

Here are my comments, in no particular order:PROs:- Great specs. This is what initially got me to try this out. Zeiss zoom lens with f 1.8 - 4.9 and 28 - 100 mm, who would not want that!- Impressive 1\" sensor (bigger sensor equals better image quality).- Separate battery means that the cell phone's battery is not used to operate this. Smart - given the short battery life of cell phones to begin with.- Can be used while not physically attached to the phone as it has a separate shutter release button- Has image stabilization- Good image quality and low light performance but a bit on the slow side.CONs:- Heavier and bigger than expected. I understand that in a way this is a full-blown camera (minus the camera body and monitor) and therefore would have to have a certain weight/size, especially with the good specs but I was still surprised by the heftiness of it. For something that I would have to carry around with me in addition to my cell phone - I am just not sure that I would do that on a regular basis or at all.- No case. Come on, Sony! You are selling this for close to $500 MSRP and then don't even throw in a protective case of any kind? Instead expect your customers to pay an additional $25 for that? Luckily I have some unused lens cases from my analog days that fit the QX-100 almost perfectly but I would really resent having to buy this case on top of the expense for the camera itself.- Connection via wireless. Why oh why does this not connect via Bluetooth? The QX-100 requires me to sever my existing wireless connection whenever I want to use it to take a picture. Not a good approach. UPDATE: Another user commented that Bluetooth would not provide enough bandwith for this level of functionality (see Comments). That user also stated that there might be better connectivity coming later this year. Let's hope.SUMMARY:This is just a bit too strange and/or impractical for me in the end. I just don't see myself lugging around two devices (phone and camera), especially not the QX-100 which is heavy and difficult to store due to its shape. Add to that having to somewhat tediously attach and detach the lens every time and basically losing the functionality of my phone because I must give up my existing wireless connection in order to connect the QX-100 - this is a lot of compromise for the money.I would also think that more serious photographers would quickly tire of this 'solution'. There is just too much lacking in features - no RAW format, no manual focusing, of course no view finder etc. Considering that for this price I can already get a decent mirror-less system camera (granted, the sensors are smaller in those), I would always go with the system camera and not make all these compromises. If it were half the price, maybe but not even sure then.I think it is an interesting first step and concept which might lead somewhere in the future but all in all I don't think this is it yet.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Early adopters sometimes pay the price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UCIR2XGETQ3S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Concept is fine but plagued by assorted issues that, in the end, make it a hassle to use.

I'll keep the device, but I don't believe most users would be willing to put up with the instablity - which is significant with nearly every application. Love the quality of most snapshots, love the handheld function (meaning operable in detached-from-device mode), but I suspect they'll iron out the flaws in subsequent versions.

It's great for getting unique shots from angles you wouldn't otherwise try. I was recently in Yosemite and set it down beside Lake Tenaya on a small Joby tripod and captured cool video of mountains reflected in the lake, complete with sound of water lapping against the shore.The problem is that it's only about 80% reliable.  Sometimes I have to reboot it to get it to hook up properly to iPhone 5s or iPad mini.  It will just sit there with a little disk spinning in the middle of the device screen, and the only option is to restart wifi or sometimes restart the camera.Sony, PLEASE make PlayMemories Home hook up to this camera and download the photos and video without having to take out the tiny micrSD card and plug it into an adapter, then plug that into the computer.  Those cards are really temperamental, and if you don't check to make sure it's made full contact after reinserting it in the QX10, you'll be disappointed next time you try to take video with it.  You won't know when shooting stills, because even without the card the 2mp sample will be sent to your phone, but when you try to take video it will tell you there's no memory inserted, then you have to pull the microSD out and keep reinserting it till it makes contact.

I think I've observed that if you hook it up for power to a USB charger unit that's plugged into AC, it will still function, but when I hook it to an external battery pack (phone charger type) from Sony it shuts off. Need to test this to verify functionality when hooked to AC via charger.I stick the QX10 in a pocket of my cargo pants, with the Joby tripod attached, and it's always with me when on a shoot, for that different angle, or selfie of myself at work.Would be nice if it came with a level.

I've seen some telephoto adapters for the iPhone that are twice the price of this.The photo quality of this is about the same as an iPhone5, maybe a touch better in low light.I do have some gripes about it that leave me using it much less than I'd like to:There are no controls.  While it will switch between modes automatically, the benefits of any mode are not explained anywhere.  I really would like a way to pick a mode Program, Auto, Intelligent Auto, and also be able to pick a shutter speed or aperture, possibly ISO.  As it is, the only control you can change is exposure compensation while in Program mode.  The higher end camera allows some of these controls, added recently to the phone app, and I expected this to be added to the app update yesterday, but it was not.It is difficult to use this to grab quick shots.  A lot of times I'll see something I want to grab right away, but by the time I get this thing ready the moment is gone.  It must be powered on with the lens sticking out about an inch, the wi-fi connected with your phone, and the app running in order to take a quick shot.  Not only will it not fit in my pocket this way, I really don't want to be running down the batteries in my phone and the camera letting it sit like this just in case a shot comes around.  It takes me about 20 seconds to power up the camera, turn on the wi-fi on my phone and select the camera, and launch the app.  I've missed a lot of shots because of this, fleeting moments doing street photography on the train for example.  A couple of times the app got stuck on \"searching device\" for several minutes, really frustrating.It gets kind of sloppy when transferring photos to my Mac.  A smaller version is sent to the phone camera roll, but to get the larger version and videos you have to upload the micro-sd card into your computer, which gives you duplicates.  It produces 5 megapixel photos that are about 2 MB.The photos are generally good.  The camera does a good job of compensating for using the telephoto end of the lens and keeping shutter speed up to reduce blur from shaking.  Low light is pretty much free from noise, it looks like the maximum ISO is 3200.  In terms of field of view, it would seem to go from a full frame 35mm equivalent of about 20 to 200 mm.Overall, this lens/camera is a good addition to the iPhone in that it gives you a good zoom range on the phone.  Whether you find the drawbacks and the price prohibitive are up to you.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Interesting Product That Might Be More of a Hassle Than Convienience", "Author": "R. Garrelts", "ReviewID": "R28K6FL4JLHFWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm having a really difficult time thinking about how to approach my review or even how I feel about the Sony DSC-QX10/B Lens-Style Camera (henceforth known only as \"camera\"). Certainly I've never quite used a camera like this one before so my review is from a novice photographers standpoint. There are a great deal of things I like about this camera but also about an equal number of things I don't like.---------------------DESCRIPTION:In essence this camera is a self-contained digital camera without the viewfinder or LCD screen. Why then would you want such a device? Well this camera is meant to be used with a compatible smartphone (iOS or Android) and is meant to replace your phone's camera with a (likely) much better piece of equipment. For one, the included 10x optical-zoom lens is almost certainly better than any smartphone camera I have used or know of. Sony has coupled their 'G' lens with a 18 mega-pixel CMOS sensor that really takes some beautiful still shots and fantastic HD (1080/30p) video.The interface between the camera and your smartphone is a free app called PlayMemories Mobile (there is also a free desktop application available through Sony.com). This application serves as the medium for viewing what you're shooting. So after charging the camera pairing the camera to a smartphone is as easy as pairing a Bluetooth device. Simply turn on the Camera with the top mounted power button (indicated by a green LED), open the PlayMemories app and select the camera SSID. There is a pin that's unique to each camera located on the inside cover of the battery compartment. This is especially important because the camera is essentially a WiFi hotspot and you cannot connect your smartphone without entering this pin.The included lithium-ion batter is rechargeable and advertised good for approximately 110 minutes or 220 still shot images. When filming a movie with the camera battery life is limited to 25 minutes.The camera comes with a neatly designed attachment tool that snaps locked into place on the back of the camera. The attachment tool uses folding, spring-loaded mechanical arms (more like nubs) to attach to the outer edge of a smartphone. The grip and fit on my Samsung Galaxy S4 is surprisingly snug and secure. The camera never feels like its wobbly or going to come off the phone.I should also mention that the camera also has a slot for a micro-SD storage card. The interesting thing to note is that the QX-10/B camera can write to both the micro-SD card and your smartphones internal storage devices. If writing to your phone a new album will be created called 'PlayMemories album'. This album is readily accessible from my 'galleries' app on my Galaxy S4.The bottom of the camera does have a standard sized camera mount for folks interested in using a tripod.---------------------WHAT'S IN THE BOX:1) QX-10/B digital camera2) Camera-to-smartphone locking attachment disc3) Lithium-ion battery4) Charging cable (micro-USB to USB)5) Wrist strap--------------------USE:Using the camera is as intuitive and natural as using a regular digital still camera. There is a physical control surface (zoom toggle) on the side of the camera to control the 10x optical zoom. Immediately behind that is a button for snapping a photo or engaging record-mode. The interesting thing to note is that all of these control features are also available on you smartphone screen when in the PlayMemories app. Just like on modern digital cameras you can set the focus by tapping on your smartphone's screen.There are more advanced features in the PlayMemories app including setting the auto-focus; self-timer; still image size: 4:3 at 18M or 5M, 16:9 at 13M or 2M and more. Additionally the on-screen information reveals how many shots are able to be taken and saved to storage, current shooting mode and an inset of the last captured shot.Response from the camera to the smartphone is incredibly fast but not instantaneous. I found shooting my 1yr old son to be a bit more of a challenge when using the QX-10/B compared to my smartphones built-in camera.The camera writes in JPEG format and does feature some metadata including: resolution, manufacturer details, flash, focal length, white balance, aperture, exposure, ISO, image size, date. As far as I can tell there is no GPS information included in the metadata.--------------------WHAT I LIKE:(+) Takes beautiful shots that my Galaxy S4 cannot match. Shots feature better colors, improved zoom level and much better shooting in bright or dim situations when compared to my smartphones built-in camera.(+) HD video through this same device is impressive! Considering I spent considerably more on a digital camcorder (also a Sony) that struggles to do both digital stills and HD movies this is a great feature!(+) The device is easy to use though shouldn't be construed to mean that it's convenient.(+) The PlayMemories app is straight forward and intuitive just like the controls on a traditional digital camera.(+) The camera can be completely detached from the device. Meaning I can hold my phone in one hand and the camera in the other for some interesting shot dynamics.(+) Largely because of the last bullet this device has a definite \"gee whiz\" factor.--------------------WHAT COULD BE BETTER:(-) This camera scores pretty low on the convenience scale. Part of what makes built-in smartphone camera's so popular is it's so quick and easy to snap pictures or take video's. That is not really the case with the QX-10/B camera. From the 'off' position to ready to shoot still takes about 15-20 seconds, after launching the PlayMemories app.(-) Sony makes some really nice camera equipment and the QX-10 is no exception but it's priced like a full-fledged digital camera that usually include a screen. In other words, it's expensive.(-) Because the camera connects through your smartphone through WiFi you will be disconnected from any other WiFi source while using the camera. If you use WiFi calling like I do this is a definite drawback.--------------------CONCLUSION:Sony delivers another interesting gadget and high-quality digital camera with a twist. While not as convenient as your smartphone camera the significant bump in picture and video quality will have you reaching for this camera for those important occasions.

I'm not a professional photographer, but I have two toddlers in my home and have been taking A TON of photos on my cell phone over the past year.  We print the images to send to family, but many of the best shots are only so-so quality-wise because they were taken with the cell phone.  That said, the two big numbers on the DSC-QX10/B are 18megapixel and 10x zoom.  Much better than my cell phone!The DSC-QX10/B linked to my phone easily, using wi-fi and a free app allows you to use your phone as a viewfinder for the lens.  On top of that, the DSC-QX10/B has two little adjustable clips that pop out and snap around your phone.  I tried it on a few phones, including my iPhone 5c with a case, and it fit on all of them!  Simple design, but it worked very well.  I'm sure there are exceptions, but it should fit on the majority of smartphones.  Not that you need to attach it.  You can also use a tri-pod or carry it around.  It seems to be designed to accommodate different accessories, but I haven't purchased any.  You can even stick a memory card (microSD) into the lens and take photos without having your cellphone tethered to it.  Otherwise, it saves the photos on your phone.The quality of the photos is far beyond what my iPhone can do, or my GoPro Hero3.  It's small, about the size of a can of soda, but only 2-3\" deep, so I often just throw it in the diaper bag or in my pocket.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "QX-100: A Missed Opportunity for the Price", "Author": "Ryan Winkleman", "ReviewID": "R1RVBUVPKR7QX0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-QX100 runs, as of this writing, for $500 on Amazon. Is it worth that cost? Well, I kind of doubt it, but that's up to you to decide, so here are my impressions.The DSC-QX100 (QX100 from this point on...) is really a great camera for macro shots. As advertised, the macro pictures are just plain beautiful. It doesn't usually have any problems focusing on close objects (within reason...you can't expect the subject to be touching the lens and still be in focus), and it really makes the subject pop with the way it defocuses the background. I don't seem to be able to upload example photos, but photos I have taken in my garden are really beautiful. The lens is otherwise very basic. The zoom is just awful and may as well not even be on it. It seriously barely adds anything to zoom in all the way. There is also a video mode, but it doesn't work unless you add a micro-SD card to the camera. While you can automatically save photos to your phone without a micro-SD card, you cannot do the same with videos.The QX100 comes with its own proprietary software, PlayMemories Mobile (kind of an embarrassing name if you ask me). The software, like the camera, is basic. Start it up and it asks you to run the Wi-Fi function on the camera; this means turn the camera on. I don't know how it works, because it isn't through Bluetooth or NFC and it isn't through actual network Wi-Fi since you can use it while not being connected to a router, but the phone and the QX-100 somehow connect wirelessly and the camera syncs images back to the phone in real-time through PlayMemories Mobile. From the software, you can control zoom, focus (tap to focus), and shutter. You can also change shooting modes from photo to video or from Intelligent Auto to Superior Auto to Program Auto to either Aperture or Shutter Speed Priority Shooting. Basic. You can also control the zoom and the shutter from the QX-100 itself with the side buttons, but you can only focus from the software.The QX-100 gives you the option to attach it to the back of your phone or to just hold it on its own. It comes with an expandable clip that you just expand to fit onto the back of your phone. Then you can walk around with a gigantic lens on the back of your phone. Make no mistake; this is not the $20 or whatever ones you see at Best Buy that are like a half-inch in diameter. This thing is massive. I have an LG G2 (one of the bigger phones available) and the diameter almost makes up the width of the phone.So what are some of the major pitfalls? Well, while the camera takes great shots, the software is terrible. I said it was basic before, but it's functionally just horrible. Many times when I open it up it lags so much and freezes while I am turning the camera around that I find myself just staring, waiting for it to come back up again so I can take my photo. It is really too bad you can't use any other software with this device. It is really problematic. The other problem is that it drains your phone's battery like it's nobody's business. The G2 has one of the biggest batteries of any smartphone, and it just brings the battery to its knees when I am using the QX-100. Want to drain your battery as fast as possible? Connect to the QX-100 and then just sit back.So all in all the QX-100 takes great macro shots but is very limited otherwise. It is extremely basic and is essentially useless for anything other than a macro shot. The software is also very buggy and not very efficient. Is it worth $500?

Sony provides a smart shooting app, PlayMemories, or you can use it with third party effects apps such as Camera360.Here are some things that the QX100 is particularly good at:- Editing and sharing high-quality photos immediately, using your smartphone's native environment & apps.- Shooting from odd positions and angles, because the lens and viewfinder screen can be in two different places (place by wildlife feeding station, compose a shot of the back of your head, sit indoors while photoing the stars on a cold night, compose a shot from inside a hollow tree, put at the top of a tripod or clamp to a stick looking down, or use as a periscope looking around corners, stealth photography.  In particular it is good for composing and controlling selfies & group shots from a distance.)- Adding 3.6x optical zoom to your smartphone (and 20MP resolution allows some crisp post-shooting digital zoom).- Clamping onto anything of the right size with the built-in lens mount, for remote/stabile shots (in case you forgot your GorillaPod).Like the RX100 (whose great optics and sensor it shares), with Sony's PlayMemories app, it is good at:- Low light, can be pushed to super high ISO 12800, great for night sky photos and other low-light situations.- Optimized shooting settings through Scene Analysis.- in Superior Auto mode, it will automatically bracket shots at various settings and does \"Overlay Shooting\" (including HDR).Features are added from time to time by upgrades of the firmware (v2.00 added Shutter Speed Priority Shooting and more ISO settings).  For me this device opens up possibilities that I hadn't considered. If these advantages don't appeal to you, you'd probably prefer getting a regular camera.I have not been bothered by the brief shutter lag time, that others have complained about, less than a second.  I purchased the fastest microHD I could (microSDXC UHS-I 64GB).  I don't know if this makes a difference, but I am finding that the lag time with an iPhone 5S is only slightly longer than with my everyday camera.  Lag time does depend on what kind of shooting mode you are using, because in Superior Auto mode, several shots will be taken with different settings, so that takes longer.  [Don't bother testing without a memory card, it won't do anything.]There are some issues to be aware of, otherwise I would rate it five stars:- No flash (but it has good low light performance), and it doesn't utilize the smartphone's flash (but if you have a flashlight mode you can turn it on ahead of time, or get The Pocket Spotlight).- There are no threads for filters (but numerous third parties sell filters that attach to the QX100 in various ways, or use software filters).- The manual is a lousy bare-bones list of menu commands and options.  See the RX100 manual instead for much more explanation and guidance (google for \"docs.sony.com rx100 user-guide\" -- too bad there is not (yet) a corresponding one for the QX100).- Overlay Shooting is automatic, so the user can't control which shots are used.- Not quick enough for action shooting, and no time-lapse.- Have to manually connect to wifi each time you turn it on [If I have the iPhone already at Settings/Wifi, it takes about 4-15 seconds after turning the camera on for the iPhone to see the camera's wifi].- Output seems to be only JPG, EXIF is lacking and there is no RAW.- Others report interference problems with other wifi in the area.I am officially impressed by the optics & hardware, from a photography perspective.  Just one example: I recently spent some cold dark nights out with my daughter while she did a bunch of camera hackery to photograph stars.  The first night I had this thing, I stepped outside and did a quick snapshot of stars that turned out great.  Handheld, they were precise and had different color tones.  I can't wait to try more.  You have to put aside your preconceptions about how a basic camera would work, and just enjoy finding out what you can do with this one.The API is public, so that other apps can work with this camera to add different features, such as software filters.  It does work with the app Camera360, which provides effects and filters, but doesn't seem to provide the various exposure controls that Sony's own PlayMemories does. (Supposedly it also works/will work with Camera+, but I haven't tried that.)And then you can optionally add PlayMemories Home desktop software for photo management, and Online for cloud management, but I haven't yet explored them (when connected to my Mac, it brings up iPhoto, which covers the same territory).", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent idea, execution of design not as excellent, a really good camera lens with MANY options!", "Author": "Eric A.

The camera easily pairs with my phone via Wi-Fi that is built into the camera and if your phone has NFC pairing should be even easier. The 18 megapixel QX-10 recognizes low light and adjusts accordingly, so it works well in darker conditions.  Sony has an app (PlayMemories Mobile, available for both iOS and Android devices) that makes it easy to take photos, although the app can use some refinement.  The lens itself hooks on the phone, or you can take photos just using the lens as a camera, which is kind of cool, especially when trying to photograph objects that are hard to reach. The camera also shoots high quality video, and the built-in rechargeable battery (rated to take 200 photos)  is replaceable. The device also is very portable and lightweight; weighing less than four ounces and measuring 2.5\u201d x 2.5\u201d by 1.3\u201d.  It should be noted that the camera does not come with a memory card but does take different types of memory, including microSD, microSDHC, and memory stick.Now the bad part.  Don\u2019t even think of using this lens to photograph sporting events or anything moving quickly. There is lag, both when taking a photo (and trying to get the object in focus) and then after the photo is taken and the image is saved (to either the memory card in the lens or in your phone). I tried taking photos in the bright outdoor and inside and still experienced lag. It\u2019s important to note that for me the lag was not consistent; at times the camera performs well (without lag and quick focus). The camera may lag in part because I am using an old phone; a newer phone more than likely will have a faster processor and the user may experience less lag.Additionally, the app allows you to share your image, but when you do this the lens disconnects from the phone so to take photos again you have to reconnect.Sony can update the firmware of the camera and hopefully improve its performance. The app also should be refined so that the camera doesn\u2019t disconnect from the phone every time you want to share an image. Bottom line, this is a nice product but not yet ready for prime time.

I like my iPhone 5 for decent shots that can be shot quickly and it even gives me some options when taking the shot. I do miss being able to truly zoom in. This camera was therefore intended to solve that dilemma  by giving you a zoom lens to attach to your camera. However, at the price point you can buy a full camera but still if it was very user friendly it would have worked. Unfortunately, it's not.First off, you have to download an app from Sony on your phone to use this camera. Then you have to install a micro-SD in the camera unit, that did not come with it. It would have been nice not to have to wait a few days for a micro-SD card before I could use it. Each time before you use it you have to turn on the Sony camera, then select the wireless network created by the Sony and then open up the app which then finds the camera. Then you can start taking the pictures. There is a few seconds lag in between when you press the shutter button on your phone and camera actually clicks the picture which makes this useless to capture shots of babies and children, pets, action shots. It is also not that great in low-light. My resident iPhone camera is better, but it's not easy to switch in between the two easily as you lose all your phone camera functions when you open up the Sony App and connect it to the camera lens. With all this lag, I'd rather just pull out another full camera or my DSLR and take a great shot in less time.What I love about my iPhone camera is that it's fast and gives me very nice pictures in all types of settings and light situations. This lens is more like a traditional camera that does not give very good pictures in low-light and is clunky and difficult to use. The only use I can see is if you take a lot of selfies, it can serve as a remote camera while you use your phone to activate it. I have not tried that feature yet outdoor.

Partridge", "ReviewID": "R2CDKSYI00CS2O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is one of Sony's attempts to solve mediocre cellphone quality images.  While the image quality is improved over cell phones, the best feature to me is adding on the 10x zoom and the wider angle than standard phone cameras offer.  You also have the ability to take better angle shots, the camera and the phone being separate allows you to say hold the camera above your head while you look at your phone's screen for control.  You can control some settings too, namely zoom, from the phone.  I've found it fun and interesting to use, allowing me to take some interesting shots I couldn't otherwise get.The problems come in with the whole concept though.  Lacking any form of viewfinder has you entirely dependent on your phone, and more notably your phone's battery life, for shots.  This also leads to a notable delay in starting the whole process up.  The startup delay in turning the QX10 on, unlocking your phone, opening the app (or tapping them together for NFC) and getting them connected takes a few seconds - in which you could have already taken the picture with your phone and put it back in your pocket/purse.  The other issue I have is that despite pairing, the images sent over aren't the full quality.  You'll have to separately get to them from the SD card or by connecting the camera to your computer.  The smartphone app is supposed to allow for transfers but seems to send over even lower qualities in my testing.  It's a nice concept but one with notable flaws.  There's issues with lack of control with the software, it's a bit limited (namely to tap to focus and exposure) but it's fine for a camera like this.While it ultimately provides better pictures, most notably thanks to a 10x zoom, the question is really if they're better enough to outdo the hassle of needing to carry it with you and pair it each time before you take a picture.  I'd have to say it's not though, when push comes to shove.  Camera phones are about convenience over quality and this presents a weird sacrifice in that.  If you really wanted better quality a small camera (e.g. canon's S110 which is about the same price) presents a better, faster, option by far.But what this does offer is a versatile, tiny camera that you can control remotely.  I've used it to take self shots without having to hold my phone out at arm's length, I've perched it on top of things to take interesting above shots and various other fun things.  It's a great toy.  If you can pick one up on sale or used, it's a great item.  For the size it's got great zoom to boot.Pros:++ 10x zoom+ SmallCons:-- Pairing adds too much delayIn the end I'm having fun with it.  I thankfully picked it up as a used model for notably less than the $250 asking price.  In the end I'd have to say it's not worth $250 given what else is on the market, even from sony.

Maybe it's the auto-gain. I used it to record live music, loud and up close in a bar, and it came out worse than my phone's built-in mic. Very flat and muted sound.* There's no jack for an external mic, so you're stuck with this one. You might want to investigate a stand-alone mic for your audio mixing (like a Zoom H2n or similar).* The battery life is poor for recording video. The good news here is that since the charging input is micro-USB, you can use those portable phone chargers, like a Motorola P4000 or similar. It will run off of that so you don't have to worry about your battery dying in mid-record. You WILL look silly, though, with a battery pack hanging off of your camera.* No flash, no attachment for a flash, no way to use your phone's built-in flash. You CAN just turn your phone's flashlight on (which is all most smartphone flashes are anyway) but that's kind of annoying.* SD CARD NOT INCLUDED. Really, Sony? And you really need an SD card. You cannot record video at all without one. Images will transfer to your phone automatically but that's not a quick process. Just plan on buying an SD card unless you have a spare.* Previews and transfers to your phone can be slow and distracting when you're trying to take a series of shots. I just disabled both things. I have it set to save to the SD card with no preview to speed it up but you still can't just go snap-snap-snap-snap. There's a good, oh, 1-2 seconds between possible shots.* No viewfinder is actually kind of bad. I have a hard time doing manual focus with only the phone's screen for reference.* It frequently disconnects in \"noisy\" environments -- I don't have any problem at home but when I'm in a bar (presumably with a lot of other cellphones and interference around), the connection between camera and phone gets unstable.But it's not all bad news, and while some of that bad news is pretty bad, the good news is delicious.* Amazing performance in low light conditions. The images AND video are brighter in replay than it was to my own eyeballs. The bar was pretty dark, the band was not well lit, a friend's phone literally was almost just a black screen for the pictures he took but mine came out looking amazing. Honestly you probably don't need a flash unless you really want that super-bright picture.* The ability to strap the camera lens to a good viewing angle and then sit back and control it from my phone IS AMAZING. I dunno what the range is but it's at least 30 feet. The lens has its own tripod hole so you can set it up somewhere and then sit back and do your clicking. This was perfect for starting/stopping the camera between songs and clicking still photos while the camera was mounted on a chair with a GorillaPod. I was just sitting back drinking beer instead of hunched over a camera.* The video quality and picture quality is amazing.* Although the camera will direct you to free software you can download to access the camera with, if you're a Windows power user you'll be happy to know that the camera's SD card shows up as a regular drive when you plug the camera in via USB, and all your images and videos are right there as perfectly accessible files. This makes me happy. Nothing proprietary about it. Standard USB cable, too.* If you don't like what the auto-focus is doing, it has a manual focus option. This is actually useful since I've seen the QX100 do the same thing my Galaxy S4 does, which is sometimes seem to get confused on where the focus should be so it keeps going back and forth. I believe it's dark conditions with bright, fluctuating light (such as a nearby TV) that causes it but I'm not sure. With my Galaxy S4 there's nothing I can do to make it stop. With the QX100 I can just turn off autofocus, adjust it to where I need and it's fine.Note that you can also play with aperture settings, ISO and shutter speed.Shutter speed: 30 seconds (!) to 1/2000.ISO: 160 to 12800Aperture: f/1.8 to f/11(This is a major difference with the QX10, which only lets you adjust ISO and cannot manual focus.)Oh, notice to Samsung Galaxy users: on your phone go to Settings -> Wifi -> Menu (bottom left hardware button) -> Advanced -> \"Auto network switch\". Turn this OFF! Mine was on by default and the phone would not stay connected to the camera. The camera has no internet, obviously, so the phone kept disconnecting it so it could get back on 4G and give me internet access. Which is normally helpful but not in this case.I suspect I may update this review sometime in the future. I need to try the camera in more conditions but I was really stunned to see how well the low-light bar scenes came out, both the stills and the video. There's also a lot of options for manually making adjustments to shutter speed and other camera features I barely comprehend, but I was able to, for example, take a picture of a poorly lit ceiling fan on medium speed and come out with a decently bright picture of what appears to be a fan that's not moving, OR a total blur, depending on the settings, if that tells you anything.I really just wish the mic was better or it had a standard camera attachment for an external mic but if you aren't planning on using this to record video of live music in noisy bars, that may not matter to you.Really, I would give it 5 stars if they could do something about the stability of the phone-camera connection.

When I was first using this, I got frustrated a few times and considered giving this a negative review, but then I saw the pictures this device produced.I have a Galaxy S3.  It has a pretty great camera already.  I've got an OK standalone digital cam that I like.  But this camera puts them to shame in many situations, and is also dead simple to use when it works (heh).So here's my review:Build quality is great, with a sturdy plastic housing and a solid feeling aluminum face that is attractive.  You get a lanyard, but no carrying case.  You also get a mount that squeezes onto your phone.  For my thinner S3 out of the case it was well held with no risk of damaging the phone, but also not quite stable enough.  In a rubber type sleeve case it was a rock solid hold.Battery life is good.  There's a replaceable battery, which is also good.  It charges via USB, and I use the same cable my phone uses.I had an old M2 card (sony's proprietary format), but thankfully this also uses MicroSD.  It also has cloud storage capability kinda streamlined in, but more on that later.The controls on the camera are few but obvious and easy to use, and there's a little LCD battery indicator too.The camera operates by connecting to your phone via wifi, and being controlled by an app.  This wifi connection is unstable, with constant disconnections.  Fortunately I didn't lose any pictures this way, but there were periods where I would have to reconnect after each and every picture.  There was a point when something came that I wanted to take a picture of and I simply used my phone's camera because I couldn't wait for the wifi pairing to happen (had I had my wits about me I could have hit the physical button on the camera without any viewfinder).I wound up using something called Camera360, an android and iWhatever app that you should get by googling the app instead of looking on the Play store (where there are pretenders using the product's name).  It pairs with the camera well and offers tremendous functionality.  It controls the zoom and a few settings, though I was very surprised by how much this camera automates, as far as settings go.There's room for creativity with this type of camera.  Flip it around and get super high quality selfies (not really my thing, but I'm not going to judge).  It has a flat base, so I set it on the ground and waited for my dog to come to her toy for some candid shots.  It is very stable sitting somewhere, so there are a lot of ways to use a ledge as an improvised 'tripod'.  You can then use a detached phone or tablet to zoom and snap the shot.  Unfortunately, there's too much lag for me to accurately get moving shots, and too much delay between shots to fake it.Photo quality is absolutely incredible.  Low light photos in particular just rock on this device, with no granularity and shocking contrast.  I really can't believe how good this thing is for low light photos.  If you've been used to a little sensor on a phone, even a great phone, you will be amazed.  It's a shame they haven't incorporated the flash on phones into the functionality of the camera, but you will rarely need a flash.I noticed the colors weren't always 'right on', thanks largely to the automation involved with the camera (I think).  Easily fixed in photoshop.  The 10X zoom is a great enhancement if you take a lot of outdoor pics.I see this as a small thing you can tuck in your bag and use with your smartphone if you catch something worth taking nice photos of.  Most of us with nice cameras don't actually bring them everywhere with us, but I think this little deal is easy to bring everywhere.  It takes pictures that are the equal of a $500 camera, too.  At least in my novice opinion.I found the wifi disconnections to make it too annoying to use the cloud service.  The Camera360 app wasn't any better at holding this connection than the Sony app (though both make reconnecting a single tap).  They've gotta fix that, but even without a smooth and constant operation I found the pictures to be excellent and I think there's a place for this product for a lot of photographers.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fun lens to use for your smart phone but don't compare it to a point and shoot or a DSLR", "Author": "pixmaker \"pmk\"", "ReviewID": "RWX2VD0H3WD1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was reading many reviews before decide on purchasing this lens for myself. I even went to the store to check out the lens myself and compare it to the QX10, which was what I originally had in mind to buy due to its slimmer size.But upon seeing the demo result, I decided on the QX100 for two very important reasons:- the image you see on your smartphone look very pixilated and jaggy jittery as if the wifi connection was very slow between the QX10 and my smartphone. When I connected this QX100 to my smartphone, the image I was monitoring on my smartphone was smooth and immediate, a vastly improvement over the QX10 image streaming experience.- Qx100 have the Zeiss lens and a bigger aperture of f/1.8, which is crucial for low light shoots, and a much bigger image sensor that will capture a much higher res image.This camera synch incredibly easy once you have initially paired it to your smartphone or tablet.All you have to do is open the sony image app and touch this lens to the back of your smartphone with the NFC option on, and the lens instantly turned on and paired to your smartphone!

It just look like a bare lens that you can aim at your subject without raising an alarm in them.You can take so many amazing candid and stealth shots of your subject that you could never be able to do with a proper camera.And the fact that you can hand held this lens and raise it high over everyone's heads  to capture the concert video clips and images with your smart phone as the monitor, trumps all its shortcomings.I am very satisfy with this purchase and hope that Sony will release a new driver update that will speed up the shoot lag time and add more manual control abilities.The only reason I did not give this lens a five star is it's slow lag shutter.

Actually the entire idea around this is cool. I had seen lenses that slide over your current camera to make it better, this however is an entire camera itself, it does NOT require your phone lens to be used at all.The concept here is simple, this device which is a little smaller than a hockey puck can be charged using a micro usb cable. If you use an android phone it's most likely the same charger. Once charged you carry it around in your pocket and when you want to take higher resolution pictures with an optical zoom you take this out, pair it to your phone and now you have a 10x optical zoom on your phone. In theory it's cool, in practice I doubt this will really be handy, at least not for the premium price tag.The problem I have with this lens camera is that it lags. For me to pair it through NFC on my android phone I have to touch and hold it to the camera for about 10 seconds. During this process the camera turns on, the app fires up, it connects and suddently I have a view finder on my phone and the camera can be attached with the auto extending arms or you can even place this camera somewhere else so that you and your wife or whomever can be in a picture and you can take the picture remotely via your phone. Great idea, but it is so slow to connect. I demoed it to one of my co-workers and he said by the time you got the camera ready to go the \"scene\" would be gone. This is NOT designed for a quick use, it takes time to get it setup.

There may be a setting to fix that, but I have not stumbled on that yet.All in all this is a handy accessory to have.  It's light weight but kind of bulky for a pocket.

So when the QX100 was announced I was thrilled! As ever, reality doesn't quite live up to the promise. After a few weeks with the QX100 I have the following observations:PROS:- Gorgeous results: The lens is 'fast' (meaning it works very well in very low light and will almost always take decent photos despite no flash) and extremely sharp even when zooming in. On larger screens you don't see the noise and compression artifacts (blurring, blockiness, banding, etc) that you see from a cellphone camera.- Great form factor: This lens has revolutionized my shooting. I can get perspectives that are far more difficult with a standard camera. For candid photo shooters it's incredible as it doesn't look like a camera when you're holding it separately. You look the other direction at the phone screen, point the camera and click.- Decent wifi range: So you can aim the camera back at you and take 'selfies' and family pics that include everyone without asking another person.- Great video and stereo audio: I would've thought capturing in busy wi-fi environments would've meant lags and stutters but even with 18(!) other access points visible on a scan it didn't skip a beat in Jax Square and throughout New Orleans.CONS:- Difficult and inconsistent connection: Turn the Wi-Fi on first and connect before going into PlayMemories Mobile. Turn the camera off and try NFC. Turn the camera on but don't connect the Wi-Fi. NO matter WHAT I do, connecting to the damn thing is inconsistent and difficult sometimes, and then it'll be flawless. At it's best it's a 10 second process. On average it's taking about 1-2 minutes to get it connected. It's a firmware update or two away from being solved, I'm sure.- It's kinda big: The QX10 looks to be a much more manageable size, but I wanted the low-light capability of the '100. Strapped to an HTC-One it's rather large but stable and not totally unbalanced. Still, it looks like there's a prosthetic proboscis grafted on to the phone.- PlayMemories Mobile is not great: Mind you it works, and gets the job done. It doesn't permit much control, however, and certainly doesn't let you get the best out of the camera as you could with manual control. It also crashes on occasion and with the pain in getting it connected that's especially frustrating. Thankfully sharing out of it is simple.Verdict: I love the thing and won't return it.

At one point, it worked properly, but most of the time, it didn't work.- I have yet to be able to take a non-blurry image.

After hearing about the launch I could NOT wait for the product to be released. The price seemed a little high so I waited a bit. I purchased an Amazon Wharehouse deal (probably from someone who posted a negative review and returned it) for the QX10All I can say is its a mixed bag.When it works it is fantastic. It's a great point and shoot camera with very simple controls, that produces great results. I was able to capture great long range zoomed shots of a soccer game that froze the action in place. I took some very low light shots of text from 3 feet away that was still very visible. I shot stills from both the macro level and far off zoomed and they all looked great. The Sony Auto modes are just what I need. Being able to operate the camera unattached from the phone is an added bonus. Since it is so small at a birthday party I was able to hold it high over my head and basically create a \"crane\" shot without actually having a tripod or large piece of equipment. Then I could see over all the other people to zoom in on the shot I wanted. I could see this being very usefull at a child's play or concert to get a unique point of view. I am a photographer so I know how to adjust manually if I need to but the point of a smart phone or point and shoot is to take pictures quickly that \"just work\". Sony has nailed the concept.There are, however, issues. Like everybody has said in the negative reviews the connection can be iffy. Even on my Galaxy Note II the connection was hit or miss. It was a complete crap shoot as to whether the next time I touched the NFC tag, it would Open and Connect, Just Open and fail to connect, or do absolutely nothing. This is not the device you want to rely on to capture quick action. Once connected, however, I found the software to be pretty solid. I really like the ability to transfer photos to the device. I dug deeper and found a setting that lets you transfer the full image when copying. I would only recommend this when you have time as the files are quite large. I waited till the end of the day and transferred all 200 pictures at once, which took about 20 minutes. Still, its a great option, especially for someone like me who likes to backup everything to a shared NAS either nightly or every couple of nights.Ultimately, this is a device you want to carry around but not necessarily use all the time. Use your phone for the pretty sunset you happen to catch on the way from the office of the silly shots at the bar. You bring along the QX10 to the Baseball stadium or a wedding to get those shots you want to look better as keepsakes, or when you need a Zoom. I guess you could say why not just bring along the DSLR on those occasions, but the QX10 is MUCH easier to carry. For instance at the Soccer game, I had my phone (as always) and all I needed for the Zoom ability was to slip the QX10 into my sweatshirt pocket where it sat till I needed it.

Firstly the offer is not accurate. You cannot take videos with the lens as shipped - it requires you to buy a micro SD card first. In the Mac version there are a number of peculiarities to contend with based on poorly developed documentation and obscure quirks. It doesn't call out the fact that in order to connect to the Wi-Fi network and enter the strange password the camera lens has to be turned on. Given that takes time to type in the password, the lens could easily, and did frequently timeout which if you didn't understand can keep you  retyping the password and network settings indefinitely. (This is all related to an iPhone and may be different on android). Once you go out to take some pictures, and then switch to something else, you will have to go back to the internal Wi-Fi settings on your smart phone and reinitialize the pairing from your settings. This does not allow for quick opportunistic picture taking and becomes increasingly annoying.The software  App has a number of settings which determine the functioning of the lens.  What each of the settings does is not explained  and I found it impossible to discover this on Sony's support page which tends to be generalized across all of their camera products. I had to fight my way up to a senior rep who also didn't really know much about how the programming on the software (limited as it is) works.  There is no access to your flash when this lens is attached so you will want to restrict its use to well lighted scenes. Sony technical help was only slightly informed about this lens, so both calls had to be bumped up to senior help which required additional waiting.Other than that the lens is good and the added capability and easy attachment  will give you superb pictures with its 10 X zoom. The size is right, and attaching it to your smart phone is easy and secure - once you purchase the necessary memory card and learn the peculiarities of having to continually reset (at least on my 4S) the Wi-Fi  pairing.

It is just too slow to use in practice and I have no good way to carry it with my Galaxy S4 attached, would much rather carry both phone and a point and shoot.Review:Download app from Google Play store (or Apple Store), tap NFC, and everything starts up in about 1/4 minute.

I like my camera to work every time in about 1 or 2 seconds max.Once in the app it works like your regular camera app would work.  Touch to focus, settings, etc.  I wish there were more settings than 2 auto modes or P mode (lets you set ISO and EV compensation).  The default auto mode is basically exposure, and the intelligent auto mode will do things like multi-frame noise reduction (shoot a bunch of images and stack them to reduce noise).  I really wish it had a manual mode.The image quality is pretty decent across the range, but really this camera is limited to good light.  Indoors I found the image stabilization didn't work very well and the lack of flash makes it next to useless with the small aperture lens.  Even if it allowed use of phones flash it would be a help.Overall I found everything worked as advertised, but I fail to see the market for this camera.  For the price I could get a comparable point and shoot which would fit in my pocket better than this, and it would be much easier to use.

This is because the lens connects using WiFi instead of Bluetooth. The iPhone can only talk to a single WiFi access point, so if that is the lens then you caannot use your home Wifi.Thus, there is no such thing as taking a quick picture with this. It has a slow-start-up. Then, you must go into settings and switch your iPhone to the Sony WiFi, disconnecting from your home network. After a bit it will get a private IP address. The communication between the lens and the iPhone is surprisingly slow, and unreliable.Zooming is combersome. The lens had issues with macro photos. And, did you forget that sometimes a flash is needed?Just a terrible product for most people.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "2 out of 3 Defective", "Author": "Carol Parker \"cbpphoto\"", "ReviewID": "R2LTSWO3IRJW6S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought three of these, one for myself and two as Christmas gifts for people in my iphone/photography centric family.  Today when I assembled the first one for myself, I was unable to connect the lens to the dock that clips on to the iphone. I tried multiple times and looked the situation over carefully to be sure I was doing it correctly, but under no circumstances could I get them to connect. To join them, you are supposed to line up the indicator lines, insert, and twist to lock. I could not push the lens into the holder no matter what I tried, and brute force would have broken the plastic. To test the situation further, I decided I better check the two gift cameras. I could not connect the 2nd unit either. Still worrying that I was missing a key step, I tried the third unit. Success (although a bit stiff), which confirmed that the first 2 were defective as opposed to pilot error.So 2 units out of 3 defective. Poor craftsmanship. I expected better from Sony.  I am returning them all as I have lost confidence in the product.

First of all setting up the software require password, the password is inside the camera and it's not easy to find.  The usb charger connect to computer only, it won't work with my lab top because the power is not strong enough so how can I use it while I am out of states.  Turning on the camera take longer than necessary, first to turn on the phone, of course the phone password, then camera connect the phone software, this process require wifi and it take time.  The worst part is the phone and the camera will shut off after a short while no activities, then I have to go back the whole turn on, and connect procedure.Buying this camera's purpose is to attend my daughter's Medical school graduation, I even brought my lap top with me for the purpose of camera charge but I didn't know the lap top is not powerful enough for the charging.  By the time the ceremony started and I tried to take picture, the whole camera froze and stuck.  Worse of all, the help web site tell me to check the data connection which I did.  The slot for the chip popped out and the $65.00 memory chip fly away on to no where can be found. All the pre-ceremony pictures are gone, all gone for this important day.I am definitely returning this product.  This product's technology is not perfect to use yet.

It wouldn't be much larger than this Sony, and it would probably be easier to carry in your pocket due to its flat shape (instead of what looks like Sony's kind-of slug-shape).  You could also get a lens with much greater optical zoom, features, etc.  You could also get a camera with a viewfinder, if desired.  From reading the other review, it seems as though carrying both your phone and a separate compact camera, wouldn't require the several parameter changes to the iPhone each time it's turned on (which was mentioned in that review).  PLUS, WHERE'S THE FLASH?  My compact camera has one.I would much rather carry an iPhone, plus, say, a small, Nikon Coolpix, or Sony compact camera.  Both would be flat, both would fit easily in a pocket.  And the camera would be ready to go with just a push of a button.  If I needed a Japanese version of a Zeiss lens, I could go with a Panasonic camera.  Plus people might wonder if they saw this ball-of-a-camera sticking out of my pants.The ad seems to imply that the 100 model with the Zeiss lens, is an F/1.8 lens when it isn't.  It's an F/1.8...to...f/4.9.  My favorite lens has always been a Leica lens.  They have such fabulous resolution, and I've never seen a lens that can match the contrast they produce.  I purchased lots of Zeiss lenses for my Hasselblads, and they are not all created equally well, though I don't know how this Japanese verson of a Zeiss lens will perform.  Mine were always German made, as were my Leica's.Sometimes, as does happen with gadgets, trying to add-on an entirely different functionality that's not \"factory built-in,\" makes for more effort and less satisfaction.  Plus, if your phone breaks, what are you going to do with the camera?These are the impressions from someone who doesn't own this Sony camera, but has done research on it, and read the only review here.  I love Sony.  With all the Sony products I've purchased in 40 years of purchasing, I've probably subsidized one of their buildings.  A good effort on their part, but I'll stick with my iPhone with a good camera, and my compact Nikon, if I need more...and a Nikon DSLR if I need even more.
