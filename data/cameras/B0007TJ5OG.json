This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)-Much better movie mode than previous Canons-Small light, easy pocketabilityOn the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:-Few manual controls.-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)-More purple fringing issues than other Canons-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace-The LCD is very fragile.  Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke.  Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either.  My suggestion?  Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's.  If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you.  I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose?  The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better.  Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image.  Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels.  In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model.  In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger.  Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models.  The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:Features unique to the SD500:-1/4 inch thicker-30% heavier-50% longer flash range-14% more battery lifeThe SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera-USB 2.0 High Speed supportThe following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:Pros:-Beautiful, eye catching design-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models-New Dig!c 2 image processor-Excellent Movie Mode-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-Uses widely available and cheap SD cardsCons (most of these are minor quirks):-Some purple fringing problems-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs-No RAW support-Few manual controlsIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card.

Good quality pictures, fast shutter speed, neat features, compact design.  I loved it while it lasted.  Too bad I can't comment about the battery life, because it stopped working on its first recharge cycle.The problem is that it is fragile.  LCD screen stopped working, even though I bought a hard leather case and kept it in there while not in use.  I never dropped it, I never did anything rough to it, but it still stopped working after little over a month of use.THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL.  Do some research and read review pages, there's overwhelming amount of complaint about LCD screen breaking.  Oh, and warrenty clearly states it doesn't cover something going wrong with LCD screen or lenses or battery leakage (come to think of it, it probably only covers the strap).  Customer services will only accuse you of dropping it, and refuse to do anything about it.The only thing I can do now is to warn others.

The SD400 is the third Canon ELPH I've owned, and it does not disappoint.As a long time user, I was extremely pleased that not only did the SD400 improve upon my last Canon (S400), it also didn't change or remove any of the functionality that I had grown accustomed to using.Plenty of reviews here praise this camera in general terms, so I will instead compare major changes compared with the Canon S400/410.  Some are subtle, others more obvious.* Smaller and lighter than the S400* A larger LCD than the S400.* USB 2.0 (notably faster) instead of the USB 1.1 in the S400.* 5MP instead of 4MP.* Digic2 instead of Digic (only the SD cameras and SLRs have it at this time).* Shoots video at double the resolution (640x480) steadily until memory card is full.* The default version of ZoomBrowser software (5.x) is much improved from the older versions -- faster and smoother to use, with better features to control the camera.  The new version can be downloaded for older cameras.* Same metal casing, but a small plastic hinge flap covers the output ports now, instead of a rubber one.* Uses SD memory cards instead of CF1.  These can be notably faster than CF1.* The physical controls are slightly more closely packed together, but I had no trouble with pressing the wrong ones by accident or anything like that.  If anything, the small controls are better organized than previously.  I always used to rotate the S400's dial into the wrong mode, which has not been a problem with the new layout which uses a slider switch and software menus.* Far more shooting modes (such as portrait, pets&children;, night snapshot, etc), and better control over focus method, flash metering, exposure metering, etc.  It's not a manual SLR, but it gets as close as pocket digital camera can.* Much faster feeling.  Shooting a photo and having it stored to my \"ultra\" (high speed) SD memory card seems to take less than half the time it used to with the S400.Highly recommended, no complaints at all.", "Date": "June 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "sunny \"sun\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1PRS7FV2W64", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now.

Compared to the previous SD200 that I owned, the Canon Powershot SD400 is a sleek and powerful camera. The metallic casing on the sides makes the camera seem much greater than it is.  The camera fits snug in my hands and the button placement makes it easy for my fingers to find what buttons I need.  With any product, there come pros and cons to functions and durability.The greatest thing about this camera is the different modes you can take pictures in.  If you're a beginner in taking pictures with a digital camera, or you just don't know how to set modes in the manual function, you can choose from different preset modes like \"underwater\" or \"portrait\".  The best mode is \"my colors\" where you can change skin tone.  You can also choose certain colors to appear brighter than others, or swap colors around in your photos.  Another excellent point is the amazing battery life and how quick it takes to recharge.A big complaint about this camera is the LCD screen.  The screen is remarkable.  It is a 2-inch LCD screen and the picture never shows any noise.  The worst thing about it is how easily it can be damaged, but with proper care you'll never get a scratch or break the screen.  Another con about this product is the red-eye problem.  When you're taking shots with flash, most of the time they will result in red-eye pictures.  There is a red-eye reduction mode, but it didn't seem to work that great for me.  An additional problem with modes is the manual mode.  There isn't much you can do when you switch over to the manual mode when taking pictures.Uploading pictures onto your computer is very fast and very easy.  You just plug the camera in and press a button.  Editing pictures in graphic programs is also very simple.  The best feature about opening a photo in a graphic program is the photo will rotate if you took the camera as a portrait.  The automatic rotation saves a lot of time when it comes to rotating photos manually.  As for the different modes, I find that the video mode works pretty well for a camera this tiny.  Sound quality comes out well and the video quality is actually nice.  You can also edit the video on the camera as well.Overall, this camera is great and it's easy to find a use for it everyday! Snap a shot of your children or maybe that bowl of fruit on your kitchen table.  Any picture you take can look just like a professional picture, as long as you have a steady hand and creative mind.  Don't just use this camera to take pictures of family and friends, take time to capture the smaller things in life.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Go Canon!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3MEUEMDMX0HRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've become a Canon fan through their cameras. I've gone through the G3, the G5, and the S1, and although these were all amazing cameras, I realized that what I really wanted was a small camera that I could fit in my purse, take everywhere with me, and use everyday without fumbling through the controls to take that one picture of my toddler wearing her dress backwards and upside down.1. This camera is small but has a relatively large screen.  Very beautiful. I suggest an LCD screen protector for this.2.  The controls are easy to use.  This little camera still has a lot more features than I use on a daily basis, but they're there when I need them.3. The battery life is excellent.  If you travel a lot, I suggest buying extra extended batteries from eBay.  I bought some just before I went on my overseas trip this past summer and I'm glad I did.4. I no longer need my camcorder.  I know, the quality isn't as good as  a dedicated camcorder, but I found myself not using the camcorder at all since it took a while to set up.  With the handy movie feature of this camera, I can take videos of my family in a snap. I also suggest extra SD cards, preferably the 1GB or more cards, if you do plan on taking a lot of short movies.5. The picture quality is excellent. One little caveat, though.  Take as many pictures of the same subject as you can, so that you can have your pick.  I've found that I really have to keep the camera steady in lower light conditions without using a flash, especially close ups and macro mode.  Otherwise, the picture comes out blurred.  It's a little hard to tell on the LCD screen. If you have a steady shooting arm then this won't be a problem for you.6. When I travelled this past summer, I found that I was able to do away with a bulky camera, the camcorder, and the laptop for downloading  all the photos.  So, if you want to take lots of pictures and don't want to be bothered by juggling three or more devices, I suggest:  a.  Buy the Mega View 566 PMC.  It has a 20GB storage capacity, a screen, and an SD slot.  I was able to store all the photos and movies from a full SD card, empty the card, and start over again. This will also fit in your purse or backpack without adding bulk.  b.  In addition, buy two or three 1GB SD cards for those times when you can't stop long enough to download your photos.  On a 3 week vacation, I easily took 20GB of photos and movies, and could have probably used more.  c.  Buy extra batteries. They're relatively cheap. And you'll always have power when you need it.  d. But the CAnon leather case.  Great for protecting your camera in your purse.  e.  For places where there will be a lot of moisture, dirt or sand, like beach, rainy places, ski slopes, in the pool, buy the Canon all weather case.  f. Buy a little make-up case to fit the charger (it's pretty small too with input of 100v-240V), the batteries for both the camera and the PMC, and your extra SD cards.  These will all fit in your purse or backpack nicely.Well, that's my take on a camcorder free life.  If they can make a camcorder the same size as the SD400, with a 5 MP or more resolution digital still camera, I'd  switch.  Until then, I'll stick with the high resolution photos, good quality video, and the highly portable size of the SD400.", "Date": "October 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Canon Elph Shines Again-Now With 3x Zoom & Large 2.0\" LCD & More", "Author": "Peter V.

I have always been interested in Canon products, especially the optics on their Digital and SLR cameras. The Canon Powershot SD400 Digital Elph has outperformed ALL of the previous cameras that I have owned. There are many cameras available with 5 megapixels or even more. It's important to pay attention to the quality of the camera in a number of different areas and NOT to just focus on the number of megapixels a camera has.I purchased this camera when it first came out-probably one of the first off the shelf. I should have waited for all of the rebate offers and sales, however I wanted to replace my previous ELPH and pass it on to a nephew so I could get the newest Canon Digital Camera. I had read all of the reviews online and in periodicals that I like to read. It was unanimously agreed upon that this camera really packed a true bang for the buck!I am a photographer and use typical SLR and Medium Format Cameras for the most professional work. I've incorporated digital photography for moments when I don't have the time to put the whole camera outfit together or when I am traveling and don't want to carry a heavy camera, lens, flash, etc. Recently I put the Canon to the test. I was called upon to photograph a Canadian Competition Bicycling team, from Toronto, that was training in sunny Arizona. The photo shoot went very well and I was comfortable that the photos would turn out great. In addition to taking my typical \"35mm Film\" photographs, I chose to use my Canon Powershot SD400 to see how it would compare.I developed all of the 35mm photographs and had prints made for all members of the racing team. After I finished this 4 day process, everything from taking the photos to developing the negatives and finally making prints of the best photos, I turned to my new ELPH and used my laptop computer to view the pictures. I was totally astounded by the incredible performance of this small but mighty camera. I decided to take it another step higher and took my Memory Card to a Kinko's Copy Center and had enlargements made-everything from 5 x 7's to 8 x 10's.The colors were brilliant and it was impossible for me to see any differences in quality between the original small prints and the 5 x 7's and 8 x 10's! As a semi-professional photographer, like so many others, I assumed that I would see a difference once the digital photos were enlarged. Not the case with this awesome digital Canon Powershot SD400 5MP Elph Camera!I hung 2 prints on the wall, both 8 x 10's from my 35mm SLR Camera, and then placed the digital 8 x 10's from Kinko's just below them. It would take a very, very professional eye, with a very, very powerful magnifier, to discern any differences in quality. I've always been impressed with the Canon Digital Cameras that I have owned, but this 5 megapixel Elph is a true gem and the best digital camera I have ever owned. I ended up with 4 photos on the wall, that still remain there, as I enjoy showing clients the power of a high quality digital camera.I hope this review offers some assistance to you. There are so many technicals points that I could have discussed with you, however I wanted to present an honest review as a result of a true experience I had with this incredible camera. There are so many to choose from, so many sales and specials and rebates, etc. If you're looking for a great camera that will guarantee you performance that even a professional would expect in a camera-then the Canon Powershot SD400 is the camera for you.", "Date": "September 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great litttle camera", "Author": "Robert G. Michelena \"RGM  'Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R9O8YXCSFEH45", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have now had my Canon SD400 for approx three months todate and have put it to considerable use already.  I have taken it to two weddings and an eleven (11) day trip to Hawaii.  I have taken scads of pictures. Here is my assessment of the camera:  Out-of-doors it takes excellent pictures.  Indoors the pics are OK, but you must know the limitations of the flash.  According to the Users manual, the flash limit is 10 1/2 feet.  And if you use the zoom indoors the flash limit goes down to 6 1/2 feet.  These guiidelines are about correct, so don't expect to get quality pics beyond these limits.  If you want better quality, the indoors must be lit with additional lighting or you must use another type camera with more powerful flash capabilities.  The fact that the camera does not have a power meter is a negative.  I ran my batteries completely out and there is a warning at this time that allowed only 2 - 3 more pics.  I have both Canon and non Canon batteries and the non Canon batteries work just as well at a far lesser price. I bought this camera mainly because of the brand name and its size.  I have had other larger cameras, and for a novice picture taker like myself, I find myself taking far more pics with the smaller camera, because I'm not having to \"lug\" along an unwieldy unit.  Placing a protective film over the screen is a good idea, as I can already see a few minor scratches on the film.  One can eventually peel off the protective film and replace it with new when you feel it is necessary  This camera has a viewfinder which for me is an absolute must because when taking pics in the bright daylight, the screen is too difficult to view at times.  Many mini cameras do not have the viewfinder which is a shame.  I have now purchased 1GB and 2GB  SD memory cards, as I have a habit of taking a bunch of pics.  The 16 MB sd card that comes with the camera is only good enough to verify that the camera works OK after taking it out of the box.  I have been setting the resolution to M1 and I got just over a thousand pics on the Hawaii trip on a single 1 GB sd card.  I took just a few shots using movie mode and it really sucks up the memory, but the quality is excellent. I have used nearly all the bells and whistles of this camera and the more you use it the easier it gets.  All in all, it is a great little camera as long as you understand its limitations.  This is an update on this camera: I have now had the camera for just over a year, and just returned from a month vacation in Australia. I took the SD 400 with me and took approx 3000 pics and the quality on nearly all were excellent. The charger is dual voltage and the voltage in Australia is 240, the only thing is that I had to use a USA to Aussie electrical adapter.  This worked out fine. I would move this camera up one more star as I had no problems with it.  Just understand It is not a full blown model camera and it has its limitations.", "Date": "November 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Small camera, great pictures and Canon quality", "Author": "Ben Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R13Q7Q7TR7X7GR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SD400 is an outstanding point and shoot digital camera for the average to slightly tech-inclined photographer.I previously had an S500 which was a great camera.  So far, the SD400 seems to improve on the S500 in every way.  It has nice and large LCD screen.  Unlike some of the other smaller cameras, it also has a traditional viewfinder.  The most striking feature of the camera is its small size.  It fits in a pocket perfectly and is smaller than my flip phone.  The time from powering up to taking pictures is ridiculously fast.The pictures are great and the camera is easy to use.  Some may complain that this camera lacks features.  However, for the average person who just wants to take everyday pictures, it's great.  So far, no complaints about this one.  The flash lights up a completely dark room w/ no problem.

Besides having 5 megapixels, the camera has one of the best movie modes in the business.  I have seen a lot of movie modes by Fuji, Sony, and others.  Canon has the best, hands down.  The reason is how they compress the movies.  Canon has the least compression (movies must be compressed from a large file to a smaller one to fit on the SD card.) The new Digic II processor assists the movie mode to a full 30 frames/sec.  Also a fast start up time of just over a second and uninterrupted 2.1 frame per second shooting.The only camera in the Canon line that has a better movie modeis the new S2IS camera.  This one also gives you stereo sound.  However, it is a much larger camera.  The thing that appeals to me about the SD400 is that you can carry it anywhere and it will be there to get the shot.  Either still picture or movies.There is a new trend of smaller cameras such as the SD400, the Sony T series, and Casio having much larger LCD screens.  These screens are 2\" or larger.  With a larger LCD, you must also take care of your camera better.  With the older cameras, the screen was small, and less likely to get damaged.  Here are some tips that should keep your SD400 from ever having a cracked screen, or for that matter any of the newer cameras from Sony, Casio, Fuji, etc. that have larger LCD screens.  (You can damage any LCD screen regardless of brand).[1] Do not place camera in with sharp objects like keys, lipstick holders, or any metal objects.  I would suggest this even if you have the camera in a thin case, as the thin case is still no protection from sharp objects that can exert a lot of pinpoint pressure.[2] If you carry it in your pocket, you should not do it in tight pants, and do not sit on the camera!  I recommend not carrying it in your pants pocket (too easy to bump into hard objects). I never have and never had a problem.  If you feel the need to carry it in your pants, carry it so the LCD is NOT on the outside and vulnerable. The older models were too thick to fit in your pocket. I think you are seeing a lot more people improperly carry this camera because of its thin size.[3] The best bet would be a well padded case (not a thin one).Padding is the key here. Pamper your new camera.[4] Do not drop camera.  Always put the strap around your arm when taking your camera out of the case. That way you never will drop it.  Any digital camera will have a high probability of damage if you drop it. These are delicate electronic devices and need to be treated as such.[5] Do not leave your camera in your car.  Extreme heat or extreme cold is very bad for any electronic device with an LCD screen.  The SD400 is no exception.There is a silent majority of SD400 owners out there that are enjoying the camera, but have not left reviews. I would like to hear from them.  Let people know of your success with the camera and you can even post images here that you have taken.  Respect the camera, and it will give you a long life.Update: Just went on a trip to Europe.  Two girls on the trip had the sd400 camera.  They did have cases for their cameras, but one did not even have a strap on their camera.  Both cameras survived the trip with no problems.  They even took the cameras to the beach, and up mountains, and on several boats.  They did not put the camera in unprotected pockets.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "SD400 vs A610", "Author": "J.

My camera is the PowerShot A610.  Hers is the SD400.  The SD400 has it all over the A610 in quality of construction.  It is stainless steel and all of the controls are highly refined.  The little camera reeks quality construction whereas the 610 is of average quality.  The 400 has much quieter operation noises.  You can hardly hear any of the mechanisms while they are working.  The compact size is a major plus!  The simplicity of the controls is also better and more accessible although it has less control features. (no manual control except 2 stop exposure correction for back lighting)  It's close up flash is better controlled as the A610 washes out when closer than 18\".  The auto focus is usually right on. The picture quality is very good.The down side:  The picture quality is not quite on par with the A610.  It does not have as good of exposure control.  Some pictures are too dark or too light depending on the lighting conditions. Some faces will wash out a little if the lighting is not well controlled. The flash is not as powerful, usually good for about 14'.It has much more low light level noise.  This is due to the size of the CCD which is smaller and must compact the same amount ofpixels on a smaller area which, I understand, is the reason for  noise.My wife loves the camera and, I must admit, we usually take it along with us because of it's small size and leave the A610 home because it is more bulky.I don't think you will be disappointed in the little camera, but it does have some picture quality/exposure deficits as compared to the A610.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Dual purpose camera for pictures and videos", "Author": "P.

Using Windows Movie Maker you can create your own movies and email them in compressed format to your friends.  That is much more versatile than working with a Handycam.The main drawback on the video function is that you can't zoom while filming.  So I suggest taking several clips and stitching them together later with Windows Movie Maker.  With that software a 1 minute video is only 5 MB in wmv format (or whatever size you want), so it can be easily emailed alongside your pictures.I suggest getting a 1 GB SD Card with it if you plan on taking lots of movies.  They really have come down in price.  Make sure you get a \"high speed card\" (45x or faster).  Compared to similar Sony cameras, the Canon uses much cheaper non proprietary SD memory and has a viewfinder to save batteries.This camera is so small that you can carry it with you at all times taking pictures and video anywhere you go.

When chosing a digital camera, it is very important to consider the company and the quality of the parts used.  It is always better, in my opinion, to go with a company which has been making top notch regular cameras for a while.  You are more likely to get excellent lens quality and camera parts.  Canon has been known to make superb SLRs and other cameras.  As such, their digital cameras are of the best quality and best lenses in the market.  As such, SD400 is an excellent product.The SD400 is a wonderful product on a many counts.- It is ultra portable.  It's compact design is not only a matter of form and asthetics.  It is quite functional... making it easy to carry around without taking up space.- The LCD screen is very vivid and clear.- The controls are very intuitive so that picture navigation and editing on the camera are easy.- It has a wide array of photo modes to suit your needs.- It is very easy to customize what size and detail you want your pictures, depending on if you plan on printing them. (If you only make 4x6 prints, you will not need to use the highest setting on the camera.  But if you plan on making an 8x11 print, you will need to increase the detail and size of the picture).- Convenient battery charger and easily removed SD card.- The picture quality is very good.  I have made prints and taken many pictures with this camera.  I have not noticed fringing problems or color problems.Some things that are not as good:- The LCD screen is a little fragile.  Most digital cameras have this problem.  But I did break it once... and it costs quite a bit to replace.- Because it is so small, it is easy to accidently touch the lense or cover the flash when you are using it.Things you will need:- Get a carrying case to protect your camera.- You may want to buy screen protectors.- Buy an SD card.  All digital cameras come with a memory card, but they are always too small (16MB).My recommendations:If you want to buy this product, remember to get familiar with the photo modes and consider the photo sizes you want.  Also, I recommend that you only use the optical zoom, and not the digital zoom, because digital zoom decreases the image quality.All in all, this is a very good product and worth buying.

After a lengthy survey of the various brands, models and prices, I decided to get him a Canon PowerShot SD400.He just loved my choice and I too must say that it is an amazing camera and performs exceptionally well.  Being sleek and compact it is easy to carry while traveling. I was surprised when I read about the different features this small camera offers. The color swap feature is great, it is easy to navigate and you can customize various settings for shooting using the Automatic Mode.  The battery life is just too good.My brother had taken the camera with him for him 2-day camping trip and in spite of taking tons of snaps he didn't have to recharge it. Moreover it tells you how many more snaps the SD card can hold. The feature of adding voice comments to your pictures is just incredible. But one thing that surprised him was that the camera doesn't show the battery status and the date.A few things which could have made SD400 a better one are: 1) the red-eye reduction mode - It didn't seem to work.  2) The outlet door that holds the battery and SD memory is very flimsy and looks as though it will break within no time. 3) Flash range is limited and the quality of pictures taken indoor is not so good. 5) The zoom doesn't work while using the video.I've heard about E18 error, E16 error and certain repair problems for the SD400, but I didn't have any problems like that and on the whole my brother and I are happy with it.

My most recent acquisition was a Pentax Optio SV which I panned in a review posted here on Amazon.Anyway, Canon is the benchmark for all other digital cameras. This model offers excellent, sturdy build (it was dropped onto a stone floor when it was only a few days old....even though it made a pretty bad sound, it wasn't dinged or scratched. I'm not sure how that can be, but it is a fact) and very good visual appeal. The size and weight are perfect. It is small enough for a purse or even a pocket, but not so small that it is hard to grasp while shooting.The LCD screen is the best I've used; 2 inches and readable even in bright sunlight. The optical viewfinder (I just don't like cameras that make you rely upon the LCD only for framing images; sometimes I feel I need to frame an image the old fashioned way) is tiny but very bright and also features all of the menu items you select from setup (or none if you prefer).The 3X optical zoom is smooth and fast and in most cases that's enough zoom power, though I did buy that Optio in search of even more power. For the record, pay no attention to digital zooms. They are computer trickery that enlarges the central part of your image at the expense of image resolution. For example, a 2X digital zoom effect exactly halves your resolution, making such images often unfit for printing. Talking about resolution and printing, the 5 megapixels available on this model allows for high quality 11\" x 14\" prints. The camera is also capable of functioning as a camcorder in a pinch, offering full motion (60 FPS) video and sound limited only by the size of your memory card.The controls of the SD400 are simple and intuitive and the menus have evolved nicely, making it much easier than it was with my S200 to navigate and adjust things. That said, the SD400 is part of a class of cameras designed mostly for automatic users; if you crave control, you're probably not shopping for this type of digicam.I find the Canon colors to be about the truest, though performance in that area is degraded when using the flash. Also, \"red eye\" is a problem, though newer software programs like Microsoft's PictureIt! Photo Premium 9 have finally made red eye fixes really easy.While I agree that the Canon's need for a proprietary battery is a pain, I am satisfied with the battery life--about 140 shots with the LCD on and the flash not in use--and I like the very compact charger included with the camera. To be on the safe side, I ordered another battery here on Amazon (a generic that is not too expensive and works identically to the branded one that came in the box).Of course the included 32 meg SD memory card is too small to be useful, but that is the case with every single digital camera I've bought. No matter, these cards are reasonably priced (though not quite as cheap as the larger CompactFlash format) and now come in gargantuan sizes if you like. I paid about $50 for a 512 MB Ultra II card that will hold hundreds of images.Lastly, I want to commend the new Digic II processor in the SD400. It is ready to shoot in about one second after it is powered up, and there is almost no shutter lag at all. Recovery time for a second shot is similarly brief. Shutter lag is a big factor when selecting a digicam and this one jumps that hurdle very nicely.All told, I'd give the SD400 a \"best in class\" ribbon.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not an improvement over the original Digital ELPH", "Author": "J. Peterson", "ReviewID": "R23WOVQA6OZXFW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After owning an original S100 Digital Elph for several years, I finally decided to upgrade to the SD400, expecting big improvements. After several months with the SD400, I have concluded that it was a waste of money because I have yet to realize any true advantages over the S100, and there are even a few drawbacks!What's definitely better:* USB 2.0. Much faster downloads that before. Be sure you connect to a USB 2.0 port, though.* Movie mode. Nice if you want something besides a still.What's better, perhaps:* Higher resolution (5.0 megapixels vs 2.1). But except for enlargements, I am not finding much benefit to this, and naturally the file sizes are bigger. I know that I can shoot at lower resolution, but then what's the point?* Smaller (only half as thick). This is nice, but not compelling. It doesn't fit anywhere that the S100 wouldn't.* Much larger display. I like it, but I'm concerned about its fragility. The old S100 had a smaller display but could be treated roughly without worry.What's not improved:* In automatic mode, you STILL cannot choose to force the flash to be used; you still only have the choices of auto flash or no flash. Has Canon never heard of fill flash? You have to go to manual mode to select this feature, which I find annoying.What's worse:* Annoying and fragile plastic lid over the USB connector. This thing isn't going to last long.* And the thing that I REALLY don't like about the SD400: blurry pictures. A significant number of the pictures that I have taken have been blurry for one reason or another, but mostly due to camera's choice of too low of a shutter speed. If you select the option of \"no flash\" this problem is particularly likely. Supposedly there is a \"camera shake\" warning indicator to help prevent this, but good luck seeing it when you need it. At a minimum, Canon needs to provide an option to prevent pictures or force flash if it computes the need for a shutter speed that is below a reasonable hand-held limit, which I have always taken to be 1/60 sec.So even after purchasing the SD400, I'm still using my old S100 much of the time, mostly because it is much more rugged, and also because I have never had blurred picture with it.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wonderful, recommend to everyone", "Author": "Eric Falsken", "ReviewID": "RZ36ETN2AUPGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No other camera can come close on the color accuracy and quality in this price range.

I then upgraded to the 3.2MP S30 and love its pictures in terms of sharpness and vibrant colors. Due to a recent good deal on an SD400 I had to take the plunge and upgrade.First of all, SD400 is a piece of art as much as technology.  I was pleasantly surprised by its dimunitive form factor then I was surprised again with its operating performance.  This is one FAST camera compared to my S30.  Starts up in an instant and autofocus is quick due to the new DIGIC II chip.  In contrast, S30 has no DIGIC(not even DIGIC I) and you can definitely notice the slower performance compared to the SD400.  However, while SD400 excels in operating speed it lacks in picture quality. I've noticed photos taken so far are softer than the ones from the S30(taken of the same subject with S30 sharpness set to middle setting).  Also colors from the SD400 are not as vibrant as on the S30 (again saturation set to middle setting).  I know some might say SD400 might have more 'accurate' colors but I (like most people) prefer vibrant colors even if they're bit exagerated.  There is no sharpness setting on the SD400 but it does have custom color setting where you can adjust the saturation but it only works when in My Colors mode.  I know sharpness can be applied on the PC but I don't want to mess with the picture again if I don't have to.  Also looking at indoor pictures, SD400 definitely has more noise compared to the S30 with both cameras set to auto mode. Noise is more prominent in darker areas of the picture.That said, S30 is more then twice(3x ?) the size and weight of the SD400 so obviously Canon had to make some sacrifices.  Lens quality is lacking compared to the bigger lens of the S30. Also SD400 uses the smaller 1/2.5\" CCD compared to the 1/1.8\" on the S30.  Squeezing in 37% more pixels into a smaller CCD does create room for more noise.  Think of it like speakers. For example, a miniature BOSE system has decent sound but there are larger speakers that will give you better sound for less money.  I'm not saying in any way SD400 is a bad camera and most folks will not notice these issues unless they make the effort to compare the pictures side by side with another camera.  This goes without saying and its a great camera for portability but if you're serious about photography you might want to look elsewhere.

I took a while and did a lot of research to find it.  I had been waiting for the right new camera and I finally found it, the SD400.  I've had it for over 6 months and I've been meaning to write up this review.I had taken over 9,000 photos with my SD110 in 3.5 years.  With the SD400 in only 6 months, I've already taken over 1000 shots.Back when I got the SD110 Canon was not as well known.  Now people recognize that Canon is a top-tier digital camera brand.My wishes for improvement over the SD110 were:- longer movie clips (only 15 seconds) - now unlimited- zoom in movie mode - YES- limited close-up range - new Digital Macro mode- higher resolution - YES- better zoom - YESThe SD400 has all of this.  The one thing it doesn't have enough of for my taste is zoom, but what can you expect from a camera .75 inches thick?  I wanted zoom, but I didn't want to sacrifice portability.  (I hate having a lens sitcking out of the camera.) In any case, it has a 3 x optical zoom which is pretty good.The best feature of the SD110 was it's compact size.  The SD400 delivers more in less space.  I take it with me everywhere I go.  If I see a shot, I can take it.  If I see a moment, I can capture it in a movie.  And no hassle with carrying a separate case.  It fits in my front pocket, even my tight jeans. (Just be careful not to put anything else in there or you might scratch the screen or even crack it.)One of the best features of the SD110 was the movie mode.  It took great little clips of super high quality with sound too!  Way better than any other camera.  The only problem was they were limited to about 15 seconds in length.  With the SD400, they are unlimited.  You can trim them in the camera to save space too.  It also can take 60 FPS for a high-speed camera effect.  When you play it back at 30 FPS you get slow motion.  The only issue is that you need to brace yourself to minimize camera shake.  These movies are better than standard video recorder quality.  They're close to HD TV quality if you use the 640 mode.  There is no jumpiness period.The other big advancement is the Macro mode.  This thing is practically a microscope.  It can take shots at under 1 inch from the subject assuming you have good lighting that close.  Add to that the digital macro zoom and you can photograph a mosquito so close that you can count the hairs on its legs!I love taking photos of flowers and always wanted to get closer.  Now I can get as close as I want.Lots of people will say you need more than 5 MP to go over 8x10.  It's not true.  I did decent 8x10 prints (with the bundled Canon software) using my old 2 MP SD110.  With the SD 400's 5 MP I have done enlargements to 12x18 that are excellent.The range of new settings on the SD400 are great.  I would like more but they options are good.  The best one is the ability to set the ISO speed.  There's a focus lock and an exposure lock feature.  I wouldn't know it if I didn't read the manual.  Nice extras for sure.  They're very useful if you're into photography.The least satisfying thing is the auto-focus.  It's odd, but I've gotten used to it.Now, to be sure it's not perfect, but it is really good.  I think it's better than 99% of the cameras out there.I chose it over the SD500 because the 500 was thicker and I didn't feel I needed the extra resolution of a 7 MP camera.  It was the right choice.Note the following:- battery life is excellent, and the charger is tiny, but if you don't want to be caught short on vacation or when you're out on a long hike, get a spare battery and charge them both.  I did this for the SD110 and I never ran out of juice.  The battery is so slim, you can carry it easily.- do get a big memory card.  I recommend the SanDisk Ultra II 1 GB.  I have two of them.CRITICAL - get something to cover the screen.  It's large and easy to scratch in your pocket.  Also in your pocket be careful to put the screen against your body to prevent it from getting poked and cracked.  I would not put it in a back pocket either.The biggest problem is holding still in low-light.  I don't like flash and I like taking low-light shots.

I can't tell you if this is better than some similar camera, since I haven't used any others.That said, I'm really liking this camera.Out of the box, it's very easy to figure out how to point-and-shoot and use basic functions with all possible adjustments set to the default \"automatic\" setting.  After that, you'll have to hit up the manual.  Due to the compact design, there's no room for a verbose menu system, so everything is icon-based.  To figure out how to access more advanced features, you're going to have to reference the manual.The manual is quite comprehensive, though, and handily indexed so I've been able to find what I wanted without much trouble.  The manual also does a reasonable job of explaining not just how to adjust the settings, but what the different settings mean, e.g., \"ISO 50\" vs \"ISO 400\".  It tells you how to change it and a brief explanation of why different settings may be desired.The picture resolution is quite spectacular.  In fact, if you're just looking to take casual pictures to send to family members over the internet or a camera to take standard-sized photos with, you could certainly get away with a cheaper camera.  This camera takes pictures of sufficient resolution to print as a small poster!  (Or a very large glossy print.)The video mode is quite nice as well.  With a 1 GB memory card, you can record over 15 minutes of video at maximum quality, or over 45 minutes of video at a medium quality (or over 2 hours of video at lowest quality).  The video also includes sound, though I have doubts as to the quality of the built in microphone.The built-in flash is great and it has a red-eye reducer.  The optical + digital zoom is fairly impressive and there other other features such as rapid-fire picture snapping (where you hold down the button as the camera clicks away) and macro mode (allowing you to take a magnified shot of something really close to the lens).Transferring data to your computer is also quite simple, with the included connections and software.  You can also, of course, review stored images using the camera itself and erase whatever you want from there.As the camera only comes with a very tiny memory card, I advise getting a bigger memory card and an extra battery when you buy this camera.  I got the 1 GB card and can honostly say it's more space than I could ever possibly want.  1 GB holds hundreds of top quality pictures -- or almost 2000 pictures at 1600x1200 resolution!There are cameras that take even higher resolution pictures than this one, but unless you know for a fact that you want to use your camera to print large posters, you truely don't need more than 5 megapixels.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "SS", "ReviewID": "R23UJL34K4A4OT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the Canon SD400-5MP for about 2 months now and overall, this is a great product.

I own a sony DSC-V1 which is a prosumer camera and has many more features (manual focus, aperature and speed and program settings, ISO to 800, etc.) which takes great pictures but too bulky for casual shooting and everyday carrying. I have also owned a 1 MP Nikon (sold for upgrade), 2MP Nikon (dropped and broken) and 3MP Nikon (too plastic and pictures always needed color balancing in Photoshop). The Canon SD 400 takes it all in terms of everyday use --- due to the easy learn features and size. For the average user, this is a GREAT CAMERA and GREAT VALUE for the price. The SD 450 has a 2.5 LCD and is heavier...After reading many reviews of the Sony T-series and SD 400 at Amazon and [...], I decided on the Canon SD 400 camera as it had many more features than the Sony T-series and was a bit lighter. Both the Sony DSC-T1 and T33 were the same price as the Canon SD 400 and about two ounces heavier.I am more than delighted with the features of the Canon SD 400 and find the pictures great for such a small point and shoot.ProsThe Manual Mode setting will let you customize various settings for shooting vs. using the Automatic Mode settings.Stitching program in Manual Mode will assist you in stitching together a panaorama shot rather than software which is more difficult to match multiple images (get it right when you are there rather than trying to adjust images that are not going to look right stitched together because you stepped back or angled the shot by accident).Ability to choose from 2 autofocus settings. The AiAF setting which is the default will take longer to focus, so you can turn it off and use a single vs. multiple focus read.Continuous shots with little lag (as long as battery lasts and memory card has storage).Easy to learn controls (the manuals that came with this camera weighed 10 times more than the camera) and features.Viewfinder with LCD (most ultracompact cameras like the Sony T-series only have LCD screens and no viewfinder).2 inch LCD.Small Size (smaller than a deck of cards) --- carry it all of the timeRelatively long battery life.Easy to purchase extra batteries (non-Canon) that are reliable and safe for the camera on E-Bay.ConsViewfinder only shows 82% of the picture vs. the LCD (You won't see that extra tree that you will have to crop out later in Photoshop).Manual is difficult to read (more a reference than a read as the camera is easy to use).Not retaining exposure change adjustments and flash settings from various shooting modes.Color swap features are hard to learn without reading the manual.Get a 1GB secure digital camera and shoot 350+ pictures in the highest resolution (super fine) and size. Carry it and you will find that you take more pictures. However, for a special occassion where there is a need to capture more detail and more manual features, I will use the Sony DSC-V1. However, I think it may get sold on E-Bay if I find that I really have the same quality of pictures that I shot with the Sony DSC-V1.Overall, I think anyone purchasing this camera will use it everyday and most, it will do more than you expected.", "Date": "September 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great package for the price!", "Author": "Bryan Hargrave", "ReviewID": "R1LQBIUVQBXOLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll admit it.

I keep my camera in a microfiber bag inside it's case, so I haven't had any scratches like I've read in other reviews.  This thing isn't a tennis shoe, so I wouldn't treat it like one.I found the documentation and the quick start guide to be more than adequate.  After installing the supplied software, I was ready to go.  I am impressed with the quick startup of this unit.  It fires up and is ready to go, right away.  Just the thing for capturing spur of the moment shots.Like a lot of guys, I like to play first, and read later.  The instructions, that is, so I was off and running.  The menus were pretty easy to figure out.  I was able to adjust resolution, adjust flash settings and choose my photo mode within about 2 minutes of starting.  Not bad.The supplied SD card is only 16MB which is inadequate if you're going to take high resolution shots, but fine if you're going for low-res quick shots suitable for email. Quality is great even at low levels of resolution.Details are great at medium to high resolution, so much so that you might reduce it after seeing a couple shots of yourself.  No one needs to see that much of me! I chose the SD series because of the SD card, that also works with my new Panasonic DLP.Battery life is outstanding, even with extensive use of the flash and LCD display.

For outdoor daytime photography, I can't tell the difference between the picture quality of the 2 cameras.  They both take excellent pictures but the SD focuses a bit faster.For indoor flash photography, I have the Canon 420EX external flash for the G3, and hence I can get higher quality pictures by completely eliminating red eye and also by using bounce flash.  However, sometimes the G3 has a lot of trouble focusing, whereas the SD400 does not.One final benefit of the SD400 is that it uses USB 2.0 transfer which is much faster than the G3 USB 1.  Also note that the SD200 and SD300 are also USB 1.I feel that everyone should have 2 digital cameras, a super compact one like the SD400 for take-anywhere outdoor phtography, and a digital SLR for indoor and outdoor when you want more control and versatility.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Soft Focus, Disappointing Results", "Author": "David Henderson \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R20XACMA8CKOBZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As a digital photography enthusiast and a fan of Canon cameras, I had high hopes for the SD-400, hoping it might be a smaller and lighter weight replacement for my Canon S-50, one of three Canons I own.

The clarity even when changed to a jpg on my computer was outstanding.I was trying to take pics of my new puppy with the fuji, the dog didn't sit still and the pics came out blurry 8 out of 10 times.  Even with the little running guy as the shutter speed setting.  The canon did just the opposite with about 2 out of 10 moving pics coming out blurry with the automatic speed (camera decides).  If you dont believe me, test it out in the store, that was the first thing i did, was take pics of ppl walking, and my rotating hand about a foot away.The camera is small and dainty, but for $350, you should handle it with care anyway.  I fear for the lcd because of most reviews.  Thats why i bought mine at costco, cause they take back year old meat!!!The fuji went thru costco kirkland batteries after 20 pics.  I counted them.  The camera wouldn't even start on Dollar store batteries.  I dont know about duracell's, its not my camera.  So far the canon has taken more than 20 and its not dead yet.The menu's were easy to use, the sub menus required a bit of explanation and reading.  As a tech geek, the more the better though, just goes to show what it can do.The software was easy to use and again, had a lot of bells and whistles to edit your pics.  It even came with an instruction manual to really do some damage if you prefer.  But for super tech novice, you did not need the book.I recommend this camera as a novice photgrapher, but i think with this baby, ill be taking a lot more pics.

Shot at 1600x1200 as well as the full 5M Pixel resolution and printed them at a Kodak kiosk that uses Kodak's \"Perfect Touch\" processing ($0.29/print). Prints look fantastic! I've also sent these images to winkflash.com ($0.12/print + $0.99 shipping) to compare the results.The only design flaw is that if I want the date imprinted, the camera steps the resolution down to 1600x1200. Since I like to use the full 5M Pixel resolution, I have to post process all my images thro' DCE Autoenhance to embed the date on each image before printing.

I did not install  any software that comes with the camera.)What I do not like:  - Still picture is not as sharp as my old Canon S410 4MP  camera.  - Still pictures looks great in bright sunlight/outdoor  conditions.  Focus much slower in slightly darker conditions.  - Camera gets warm after a little while.  The camera (and  the chips inside) are not hot, but it is uncomfortable to  have warm metal in your hand.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Jason \"Penn '99\"", "ReviewID": "R1JZFZWLE27B2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "However fragile - mine broke when I dropped it, thankfully bought it with AMEX and am getting reimbursed.", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent for every ocasion", "Author": "Leonardo Manrique", "ReviewID": "RDATZZN1BOQS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pocket-size, great features, excellent speed.For traveling, family pictures, party and every situation.

As a Computer Engineer and Computer Tech I am required to work a lot with digital cameras. I must say that this camera exceed all my expectations. Great quality, small, long battery life, great flash and many options. When I print the images at local stores (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc.) the images are so sharp, some people think they are post cards.Even though it's a bit outdated, I still recommend this camera. Don't let the megapixels fool you, it's all marketing techniques. Even though it is only 5MP, this is more than what most people need. I take most of my pictures at 1600x1200 which is not even using the full potential of the camera which goes up to 2592x1944, and still the images and printed photos come out spectacular. For those of you experiencing the \"Memory Card Error\", save your pictures first on the computer, you can use an SD adapter or if you have a memory card reader just plug it in. Once you have saved all of your pictures on the chip, perform a format of the chip on the camera, it is located after hitting the Menu button, point to Tools icon, then scroll down. The option to format is right under \"Clock/Display\". If you still continue to experience problems try a different brand of SD cards. I use Sandisk, RiData, and Kingston which work very well. Some of you have also been wondering about how to reset your camera to factory settings. Turn the camera on and press the Menu button for about 6 seconds. You will then be asked if you wish to reset to default settings, select yes. This solves a lot of out of focus problems or incorrect settings applied to the camera. If you have any problems with your camera just contact me, I'm willing to help.Joshua Marius[...]", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon's great customer service", "Author": "F.

Canon said they fixed it as a courtesy.  They didn't only fix the display, but they updated the software, fixed the zoom, which she didn't even think about at the time to ask them to also look at, and they even polished it so it looked almost new.

We switch out the memory cards to empty the photos, and allow students to keep filming without moving the camera. The two features that make this camera work well for animation are:1. Auto power-shutoff disabling. So the camera doesn't turn off while you adjust your puppet. It does go to sleep but a half-press of the shutter button wakes it right back up.2. Timer mode, 2 seconds. You can set it to take a picture exactly two seconds after you press the button. It beeps repeatedly which reminds the animator to take their hand off the camera (mounted on a tripod or stand) and out of the frame. The result is much less camera movement and accidental hand shots in your animation. Without this, even the pressure of your finger as you press the shutter button moves the camera enough to create shifting frames.We chose the 3x zoom, which is pretty low as far as zooming capabilities go, since we can always get the camera close to the artwork to get a clear close-up.

The zoom is very good. The resolution of the pictures is great.2) The pictures it takes at night impressed me, it's awesome the quality of the pictures in places that are poorly illuminated.3) The most outstanding feature is the MY COLORS MODE (the best are Color Accent and Color Swap), no other camera has something like this. Playing with colors is really fun and you can put your creativity to work. And you do it all from your camera, before taking the picture, not AFTER and having to use special software.4) It also lets you set the begging and the end of a video (cutting it) and watch the videos in slow motion.5) The software is useful and easy to use and install.There's ONLY ONE THING I DIDN'T LIKE, it doesn't come with a carrying case. So I bought the Canon PSC-90 Deluxe Leather Case, which works great and it looks cool.Also it comes with a really small memory card (like every camera in the market) you will always need to buy a bigger one. I bought the Sandisk SDSDH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II.You probably think that 1 GB is too much and maybe it is. But the size of a 2-minutes-video in the highest quality is about 190 Megabytes!------------ IN COMPARISSON TO OTHER MODELS/CAMERAS -----------*This camera has the same features of the SD450, the only difference is that the SD450 has a 2.5 inch LCD screen (instead of 2.0), but it usually cost between $70-$100 more and the controls in the back are smaller; so is not really worth it.* Is very similar to the SD500, the main difference is that the SD500 has 7 Megapixels. But it is bigger and more expensive. And more Megapixels don't always mean its better. I mean with my SD400 pictures can be of 2.5 Megabytes (that's a lot), so you won't always take all your pictures at the full resolution and full size.* I really thought about getting a Panasonic Lumix, mainly because of the Optical Image Stabilization, but I haven't had troubles of blurry pictures with my Canon and the MY COLORS MODE is a better feature.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Small, sleek and great images.", "Author": "D.T.", "ReviewID": "R168BTPD1GHRUW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this I've been pretty pleased with this camera.

It is very miniature, looks cool, feels sturdy and heavy in your hand with its stainless-steel case and metal buttons. It looks and feels durable as well. I perceive this camera as a piece of techno-jewelry from the aesthetical point of view - I am tempted to keep this camera just based on its looks and miniature size alone.The camera has a retractable lens that extends and has a lens cover that opens when the camera is powered on. When the camera is powered off, the lens retracts and the lens cover closes.The camera has an on/off button on the top deck as well as a zoom rocker, large shutter release button. The bottom of the camera has a metal threaded tripod mount and a battery and SD card compartment lid. The rear houses a bright 2-inch LCD monitor, an optical zooming viewfinder, control buttons and a cool-looking menu control metal disk with a select button in the middle.There is also a sliding switch between review, movie and still picture taking modes. This sliding switch has very well-calibrated effort - not too flimsy yet not too stiff, unlike the previous Digital Elphs, which had very stiff controls. The side has a metal cover, underneath which you can find a USB jack, A/V jack and a DC power input jack.Just as SD400, the SD300 is incredibly easy to use. I have not read the manual (I have not even opened it), but was able to use the camera and all its features in no time. The camera can be used by any member of the family and by photographers of all levels of expertise from novices to advanced ones (albeit it will not give you much control over the shutter speed or aperture).The SD300 comes pre-set to Auto mode. You do not have to do anything other than point and shoot - the camera takes care of the rest. The camera uses 9-area intelligent autofocus. You press the shutter release button halfway to make camera focus and the camera shows you (on the LCD screen) where it focused by displaying one or more green rectangles. Then you take the picture by pressing the shutter release button all the way.If you want more control, you can select Manual mode, which is not a real manual mode where you would be able to select the shutter speed and aperture, but rather a mode in which you get access to selection of several parameters. In Manual mode, you can set the ISO (50-400), white balance (several presets and custom), use exposure compensation to make pictures darker or brighter, use picture effects, color replacement effects, etc.The camera gives you instant access to the flash mode selection (flash off, red-eye reduction, night portrait, auto flash), macro or landscape mode as well as drive mode (single frame, timer or burst/continuous shooting) at a push of a button.The camera uses the latest version of Canon DiG!C processor - DIGIC II. It is the same processor used in larger Canon digital SLR cameras and it gives this Digital Elph amazing speed. The camera takes less than a second to power itself on in review mode and only about a second to power on and extend its lens in shooting mode. It feels instantaneous.The SD300 can capture images at about 2-2.4 per second in burst mode (I used Kingston Elite Pro SD memory card). In single-frame mode, the camera could snap pictures as fast as I could push the shutter release button (1-1.2 seconds per picture). The focusing takes less than a second (in bright light or in dark environments) and the shutter lag, when pre-focused, is almost unnoticeable. The focusing is slightly slower at telephoto, but still under a second.The zooming from wide angle to telephoto (or back) takes less than two seconds and is responsive, but has less steps than I would like.According to Canon, the camera can take about 140 pictures on one charge of its miniature battery (400 with LCD off). I have not validated this claim, but I took more than 60 pictures and 8 minutes of video and the low battery warning has not appeared yet (the camera has no real battery status indicator).The flash is rather bright for its size. It has an effective red-eye reduction mode and is sufficient at up to 10-12 feet away. It has a recycle time of about 7-10 seconds.The camera produces excellent photo with well-exposed, sharp, contrasty and richly-colored images (see the samples). The sample photo can be seen at[...](you can copy and paste the above address into your browser's address area)The skin colors are true to life and pleasing. The photos taken with the SD300 are sharp from corner to corner with only the very edges of the frame being slightly softer than the center. This will not be noticeable in printed pictures however since corners normally don't make it to the print due to the aspect ratio difference and other factors. Plus, the blurriness is so small, you have to enlarge the image to 100% on the computer screen to notice it.Usually, the smaller the camera and the higher the optical zoom it can provide, the softer the image becomes, especially at the corners of the frame as it is difficult to produce compact optics with high zoom levels. Surprisingly, the lens on the SD300 is so good, there is only a small amount of blurring in corners. Overall, the lens produces sharp results at all zoom levels and has impressive 3x optical zoom range.The image noise is absent at ISO 50 and cannot be found even in the shadows. It appears (slightly) at the ISO 100 in the shadows, gets more pronounced at ISO 200 and gets worse at ISO 400. Still, if you are printing 6x4 or 5x7 pictures, the noise should not be visible at all and will only be slightly visible at ISO 400 with larger prints. With 4-megapixel shots it produces, you can print your photos at up to 11x14 inches with good detail (ISO 50-200).Recommendation: I highly recommend Canon SD300 if you want a miniature, cool yet capable camera with 4-megapixels that produces excellent photos with print sizes of up 11x14 inches. It is extremely fast, easy to use and, dear I repeat it again, simply cool.If you want more control, you might want to check out slightly larger Canon PowerShot A520.", "Date": "January 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "The perfect gift for a 20 year old art major.", "Author": "Jan S.

It is very small, and I like the color. I don't like the Casio Z750 design as much, however, it does have a larger LCD screen, and it is thinner and lighter compare to SD400.  Since Casio Z750 is 7mp. and SD 400 is only 5mp, it is pointless to point out the image quality. However, Casio z750 took way better night time(or dark environment) pictures than this Canon SD400, and also the color is way way way better and way vivid than the SD 400. It also got way faster camera starting time(only a second then it is on and ready to shoot), and way way faster shutter time..This is a huge plus to me.  SD400 got very limited manual control and Z750 got tons of manual control which u can play around.  well, one thing I love about canon is the charger, way smaller and easier to carry around than Casio z750..I have to say that one thing I hate about Casio z750 is their docking system.

The menus are easy enough to navigate through and I appreciate the ergonomic layout of this camera, especially for its size.  The screen size and quality were also decent for the time, though are poor by today's standards.  This camera has a diopter which is getting unusual on digital cameras these days...but the diopter isn't very good and doesn't even show the full frame.  Still glad to have one available, especially if the screen were to be damaged.  I will praise the screen for having held up quite well over the years.Unfortunately the job of a camera at the end of the day isn't size or ergonomics, it's taking pictures, and this one doesn't take very good pictures.  The lens isn't very good.  The flash is close to the lens and isn't very good either.  Despite the various shooting modes and settings (including a decent manual mode), I have struggled the last 5 years to get any decent photos with this camera and if I could do it all over again I'd have gotten the Nikon I'd also looked at despite its having been a bit bigger.As for build quality...well, for a modern digital consumer device (read: disposable) it's pretty good.  It has a little bit if heft for its size and the case is fairly solid.  This is a portable go-anywhere device for me and I haven't coddled it any.  That 5 years on it only has a wonky mode slider (the switch that sets between camera, video and view modes) that, although still usable, is on its way out is not half bad.Battery life...well, of course it was better when it was new but flash photos have always reaallly killed the battery life big time, and because the photo quality isn't very good, I find I have to take many photos of a given subject to have a chance of getting one half-decent shot, so that also takes time and saps battery life.  In all, I'd have preferred at least double, or better triple the average batt time I have gotten with this camera.  I supposed Canon wanted to profit on spare batt sales.  At least the charger is small, sturdy, well designed and charges reasonably quickly, especially by the standards of 2005, and I do appreciate its being a lithium rechargeable--this was definitely a selling point as I do not care for cameras that use disposable alkaline batteries (always dead and expensive to keep buying).Only reason I still have this Canon is that I cannot afford to replace it.

The camera itself is so small and lightweight compared to other cameras, so TAKE CARE OF IT!Overall, it's a PERFECT camera.

I too decided to buy a cannon SD camera and got the SD400 [...]. The 400 is also nice but what worries me a little is the LCD screen. It's got to much static compared to the SD300, I see a lot of grains in the screen. The pictures are pretty clear but it's a little disturbing to look at the screen when taking photos. If you were to move the camera fast then the image is blurry in the screen.The 300's LCD screen was pretty clean and neat.I requested Dell to send me areplacement and they sent me one, not much improvement though, the LCD is brighter in the 1st one compared to the second one and the static is more in the first one. The 300 has much less static....But when I checked a SD400 at a near by best buy store it was much more clear and had less static so now am wondering what to do...return SD 400 and get a SD 300 or just get a SD 400 from a local store at a costlier price...I guess I liked the 300 compared to the 400 because of the LCD.I believee with the 300 you could take decent 8.5 x 11 prints and I would not need larger prints.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good product but poor seller service", "Author": "E.
