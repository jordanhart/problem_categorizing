Mooney", "ReviewID": "R35NKG1XPO29CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I am pretty familiar with Nikon's digital controls having owned a Coolpix 880, I recommend spending some time with the instruction manual:  Not because I think the camera is that complicated, but so that you can fully appreciate what the 5700 can do!  This is an excellent camera if you really want a digital SLR but can't justify the cost; the 5700's electronic viewfinder behaves like a true SLR while the 8x optical zoom (not digital, which is nearly worthless) covers most lens focal lengths.I love my film cameras (also Nikon), but there are many advantages to owning a digital camera.  Not only can you see your results right away, but the digital nature has some cool advantages - want to shoot in B&W;?  Don't change film, just change a camera setting.  The viewfinder in the 5700 will also show in B&W;!  That's pretty cool.  At a decent resolution with moderate compression, I can get 1,100 images on a ... 256 MB card.  Yes, that's one thousand one hundred - at a quality that will produce a very decent 8x10 print.  How many rolls of film is that?Of course the Nikon quality is exceptional, from the ED glass in the optics to the very strong alloy body.  I do not feel that the size is too small, but I do find the positioning of the right camera strap a wee bit awkward.  If you do consider digital, with the 5700 or not, I do recommend buying extra memory cards - the prices are low and the 16 to 32 MB cards that usually come with the camera will fill too quickly, especially if you want to use the full 5 MP resolution.  Also, battery life is a problem.  Buying those ... lithium batteries for the 880 (same battery as the 5700) nearly bankrupted me until I bought Nikon's rechargable battery system (which the 5700 comes with - kudos to Nikon).  Buy an extra battery or two - you will not regret it!  Indeed, shell out the bucks for the 5700, you won't regret that either.", "Date": "May 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3E6IUS0YXGQBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes amazingly detailed pictures and the colors are very true to-life.  I have been taking all of my pictures in FINE mode (the highest quality JPEG but not as high as the RAW mode) and can't imagine anything better.  I have printed out 8x10s on my 3 year old HP 970, and ordered prints through Snapfish.  I have to keep pulling them out to look at them because I can't believe how clear they are.  On my computer screen (17\" Sony Trinitron)I can blow up pictures of my 3 year-old daughter to life size with no pixelation.  In fact, they get clearer initially as I zoom in because the picture resolution is greater than the screen resolution.  Nice software suite included which makes it easy to remove red-eyes, crop, etc.  I don't even bother with the red-eye flash mode anymore, just clean it up on the computer.  Plug-and-play with Windows XP is awesome.  I have read other reviews about being unable to use the autofocus indoors which I don't understand. I bought this camera as gift for my wife and have been taking most of my pictures in our basement in very low light conditions over the past two weeks.  If I zoom into a dark corner from 40' away, it might take a few seconds but it always works.  After reading the manual when I first bought it, I did change the autofocus option to \"Spot\" from \"Matrix\".  This lets the camera just try to focus on the very center of the viewfinder/subject.  I went outside this evening and took a pictures of a neighbors' Christmas lights approximately 200' from my house and didn't have a problem with the autofocus.  The only problem I see with the autofocus would be with someone who was shooting action photos.  The autofocus does take a second or two to lock in.  After the first day, I haven't even used the LCD.  To me it's much more natural to look through the viewfinder, and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera fits perfectly in my hands; nice grip.  The only issues I have seen with it so far are relatively minor to me (but they may be a bigger issue to someone else).1.  Short battery life.  You will need at least 2, maybe 3.2.  Save yourself some gas (or postage) and purchase at least 256 MB of memory when you buy the camera.  The card that comes with the camera is useless.  It's pointless to have a 5 MP camera if don't have the memory to store hi-res images.  You can fit about 104 on a 256 MB card in fine mode.3.  Doesn't come with a power adapter.  You may want one.4.  Nikon does not support filters on this camera.  I have traded e-mails with Nikon and the reason they don't is because filters will cause vignetting on most of the range of the 8x zoom.  It does come with lens cap.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this camera.", "Date": "December 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Review from a persnickety photographer", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3KRGKKH1BP7TG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first real film camera was a Pentax Spotmatic 35mm SLR. My current film camera is still a Pentax Spotmatic. To those whom it matters, that should say it all.In the store, I compared the Coolpix 5700 with the Minolta Dimage 7i. The Minolta starts up faster, due to the manual zoom optical system. However, the musical tone it makes is very unprofessional and calls attention to itself. The Nikon does a mechanical initialize and then with a slight tone is ready; more like a pro's camera. The Minolta has larger displays (viewfinder and LCD) that make changing settings easier. (I wish the Nikon's displays were that size!) However, the Coolpix's LCD viewer (normally placed against the back of the camera to protect it from scratches) can be rotated to most any angle required, including downward to facilitate holding the camera overhead and still being able to compose shots. Try that on your 35mm film camera!For manual focussing, the Minolta has a manual focus ring, but it requires a lot of turns to go from infinite to macro (very slow if you are used to the focus ring of a 35mm SLR camera) and the display is pixelated in some way that makes it difficult to determine when an area is in focus. The Coolpix 5700 requires pressing buttons, but gets there quicker and the focus is more like the ground glass of a 35mm SLR camera.In the automatic mode, the Coolpix 5700 is hyperactive, always busy checking and adjusting focus. I found that annoying. I guess it reduces battery life, too. So, I set the user modes to check focus only when the shutter button is halfway down. Once the camera has set the focus, a picture can be taken as fast as a film camera. In very low light, the camera may have a problem finding the focus point. In this case, you can either manually focus the camera, or use a pocket flashlight to momentary shine on the object - the camera will lock in instantly.In the studio, the Coolpix 5700 works as good as any 35mm SLR for portraits. By swinging the LCD display outward, a portrait can be composed easier than it would be peering into the viewfinder of a 35mm SLR camera. The results are equivalent to 100 ASA 35mm Kodak Ektachrome film, with the advantage of being able to get a print within minutes. I have an HP Deskjet 932 and use HP Premium Plus glossy paper. I get a print that is as good in quality as a regular glossy print from film, except that the dot pattern from the ink jets is visible on close inspection - instead of the normal soft grain of photographic film.In the field, the LCD and viewfinder displays stand up to all but direct sunlight. I wear glasses, so light does stray into the viewfinder - however, I get that with all cameras. I have developed the technique of shading the top of the camera with my hand and this technique works fine with the Coolpix 5700. I find that the camera snuggles nicely in my hands. Some reviewers report encountering a problem with the right eyelet - I wonder if they are holding the camera correctly? The correct way is shown in the manual, similar to the way you would properly hold a 35mm SLR camera. Also, the editorial reviewer states the camera may be a bit too small considering its functionality. That's an interesting comment. I find that in the field, smaller is better as long as the camera is rugged (which the Coolpix 5700 appears to be). A small camera is less obtrusive and less of a burden when wandering around all day long in a crowded air show.There are so many functions built into this camera that there is almost nothing you cannot do with it. Hoever, the big disadvantage of this camera is having to negotiate the complex menu structure to find all these functions. I have problems with it at times and I am very experienced with computers at that! That slows down making certain changes, sometimes requiring a check of the manual to locate a certain setting. With some planning and programming the user modes, you can limit this problem when shooting in the field by setting each mode for a certain type of situation that might be encountered.The final word: Pentax Spotmatic 35mm film cameras have been my friends for many years. They are now relegated to the closet, replaced by the Nikon Coolpix 5700.", "Date": "May 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "The ALMOSt pro Digital camera for under [$]", "Author": "Mike Walker \"Filmmaker and Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R2B8W98P6U4MQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rivals the [$] pro cameras on the market. Add a 1 Gig IBM Microdrive and you can take 134 photos in the high res. Raw format which will easily make a perfect 13x19 print that is true photo quality. The minimum density is fantastic so skin tones are beautiful, I was shooting with a Nikon N80 and scanning the transparencies with a Canon 4000 DPI scanner. That is both expensive and time consuming. This camera is about 80% as sharp as that combo...but with a better contrast range! My average session with a model is 6-8 rolls. With 2 microdrives I can achieve that quaintly with no computer necessary! And the cost of a single drive is recouped in 3 sessions (Film and processing costs eliminated).Cons: Horrible low light sensitivity...Slow saving in the HiRes modes and the camera controls TOTALLY lock up while the cache is written to the disk/drive (after 3 consecutive shots in HiRes ONLY). You can shoot, but not change ANYTHING manually. This problem disappears in the JPEG modes which are fine for many applications. Autofocus is slow at extreme telephoto setting and in low light. AND the shutter release button delay is intolerable when using flash or in low light.So if you want to do a lot of action photography pick another camera. If however, you want the sharpest image for the least money then buy the Nikon Coolpix 5700. And buy several extra batteries and as large a storage device as you can afford.", "Date": "September 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "This camera will drive you insane!", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R99VS5HGN9YDJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read the user warnings:  impossible low light autofocus, poor manual focus with no distance indicator, battery eater, buttons on the side can't be found when you need them but always hit by accident, no filter threads.  I thought, \"It's a Nikon.  Must be operator problems.\"  I was wrong.This camera has a good flash and works well with Nikon external flash units, but there's a catch.  The camera will not focus under conditions when you normally need a flash!  No focus assist light, and the manual focus...you've got to be kidding:  Hold down a button on the side of the camera while turning a knurled wheel on top.  Under really bright conditions, you can sort-of tell when the image is in focus, but under those conditions, you probably don't need manual focus.  If you think maybe you'll just estimate the distance under dim light and dial it in, well guess what?  The focus distance indicator is a bar which slides between a flower and a mountain.  How's that for precision measurement!Yep, it eats batteries.  Buy two spares ($$ ouch!) and a rapid charger plus a car adapter.  You'll always have batteries on you mind when you use this camera.  You can turn off Continuous Autofocus and reduce battery drain, and noise, significantly, though.I found a press-on adapter for $25 to use standard threaded filters.  That helped, but should not have been necessary on a $900 camera.And just wait till you hit the file type button by mistake--and discover you've changed from Fine (JPEG) to RAW, and have to wait 45 seconds for the 15MB file to save to CF, while you scratch your head trying to figure out what happened.Yes, the menus are a little complex and mastering the extensive feature set may take a while, but that's to be expected with this many features, although some would be better placed for quick access.  Built-in macro focusing is good, too, but an aperture smaller than F8--at least F11 or F16--might give the depth of field you need for close-up photography.  The 8:1 zoom is nice, with 35mm  equivalent of 280mm, but the wide angle end is weak with only 35mm wide angle instead of the more usefull 28mm equivalent.  And given the price of this camera, image stabilization should be included for hand-holding the telephoto zoom.But it's the low light focus that will drive you screaming into the night.  A helper pointing a small flashlight or a laser pointer at your subject will help the camera to focus (you'll get used to the Canon people laughing at you), but you'll still be guessing on the composition, since the viewfinder display goes nearly black in low light.  If Nikon could at least update the firmware to display manual focus distance in feet--that would be a help, but just try and contact anyone interested!  You get referred to the incredibly lame FAQs and \"knowledge base\" every time!If you really want the precision framing of TTL viewfinders on a digital, save your money for a true digital SLR.", "Date": "September 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "One of the Best for the Price!", "Author": "Scott K. Brown \"Mac Expert\"", "ReviewID": "R1V7TLMPJRF2WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading these reviews I am starting to wonder if we are even discussing the same camera; people either love it or hate it. I am of the former persuasion: I really love this camera. No, it's not perfect, but all in all it is the best digital non-SLR machine I've ever used. First I'll discuss the things I'm not happy with; then I'll cover the features of which I am. After that section I'll address some of the complaints that I've read in some of the other reviews. Let's get started:What don't I like? I do wish the buttons on the side of the barrel were moved as they are a bit too easy to push by mistake, though once you get used to their location that sort of goes away. I also wish the tripod mount was directly in-line with the lens, not in the middle of the bottom of the case (though to be fair, that's the way it is with most cameras).Nikon refers to the included 16 MB Compact Flash card (think of it as your digital film, if you aren't familiar with the digital camera world) as a \"starter card\"; and that unfortunately is true. 16 MB only holds 12 pics at 5 megapixels.. For the price of this instrument I strongly feel Nikon could include a larger capacity card; 64 MB or higher would be ideal but I'd settle for 32. Finally, it would be nice if the camera would accept other forms of media in addition to the compact flash or micro drive. However, this final observation isn't really a major complaint. It's more like a wish.The things I lovePicture quality is first rate! The color and clarity of the pics are superb, as is the tolerance of slight hand shake. I've taken quite a few snaps where I've known I moved my hand a little at the last moment, and the pics came out razor sharp (not so with other cams). It has auto bracketing (it will take a series of shots that vary between a range you select for white balance/exposure, adjusting slightly between shots, and display the results with the data, allowing you to choose which is the most satisfying), best shot selector (you hold the shutter release button down and the 5700 takes a series of pics-up to 10-and saves the best focused to the card), image sharpening, noise reduction, and about a million other settings. It also allows you to save up to three sets of options or settings as \"user settings\", so you can recall the settings with just one menu choice, instead of resetting everything again.One of my favorite features is the macro mode. You can take sharp amazing snaps up to 3 cm or 0.8\". If any of you are interested in seeing a sample, send me an email.The printed user guide is good; not great, but good. I haven't seen any that were better, and quite a few that were worse. You could buy a third party guide to the 5700, and they are usually worth the price, as they give you tips and lessons that the manual doesn't include. Also, the Nikon web site has a multimedia manual/lesson feature for the 5700, and it is a very good overview and covers the basics well. This is provided free of charge.The case is metal, which makes it feel substantial and allows the quality of the build to come through. I don't feel that it is too small, in fact, it feels pretty much just right and I am rather ham-handed. I also love the fact the camera can save in the RAW format for use in programs such as Photoshop CS. Working with RAW images really opens the field of creativity. Complaints Others Have ExpressedThe most common seems to be the auto-focus at low light. I've not had any trouble at all with this feature. I've taken pics in pretty dim areas and the AF worked fine. I wonder if the folks who had problems had the selected the correct settings; a read of the manual could solve the apparent problems. In addition, you can turn the auto-focus off and use the manual (focus)I've also read some have found the buttons confusing. Now here I feel I must get on my soapbox. \"Prosumer\" level cameras are called such and cost the amount they do because of the quality of the images as well as the user controlled settings/features/options. If you are going to spend the kind of cash these machines cost, then it only makes sense to devote some time to learning how everything works. Any camera at this level is similar, there are just too many options to be able to make everything appear when/where every single user expects them to.  I've taught enough people to know that some folks become very frustrated very quickly no matter what the subject. If this is you then I suggest you avoid the Coolpix 5700 or any of the other cameras at this level; you'll just drive yourself nuts. There are a number of good quality point and shoot models in the market and these will be a much better match. If you are one of the folks who enjoys learning new things and the challenge of such, then these types of cameras are great. In the case of the 5700 I found the menus quite intuitive; however, you do have to read the manual to get an overview of how the camera works. Some people also complained about the battery life. I've not experienced any problems. In fact, I own dig cams from Kodak, Olympus, Pentax and Canon, and all operate about the same as the 5700.", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Absolutely awesome.", "Author": "Bob Bradford \"mixwiz\"", "ReviewID": "R6GW0M45N1H3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Coolpix 5700 is my 5th digital camera (3rd Nikon) - and no previous camera compares. The 8:1 zoom alone is worth the price of admission (it's what I'd been waiting for.)Until this camera I had a firm rule of no camera without an optical viewfinder. I had seen too many digital camera users stuck in very bright or very low light, unable to use their cameras. I warily decided to make an exception based on the fact that in addition to other compelling features of this camera - e.g., 8:1 zoom, 5 megapixels -  I got through-the lens-viewing, albeit electronic. Well, this electronic viewfinder is so good that in my opinion this camera really is an SLR.  In fact, I don't know why they can't call it that. It does have viewing through the lens, whether there's a flip-up mirror or not. I would imagine terminology will eventually change to allow such cameras to be called \"Electronic SLRs.\"I disagree with other reviews I've read that talk about a steep learning curve. I found learning this camera rapid and intuitive. Especially if you've used any of the previous Coolpix models, you'll find everything just where you would expect it to be, but more refined and elegant than in previous models. It is very easy to navigate the menus and to set up. And of course in the default full-auto mode it works just like any point-and-shoot. There's no reason anyone can't pick up this camera and use it right out of the box.A reason why I haven't bought any previous high-end digital SLR was a concern about size and weight. I had to have a camera I could carry around my neck for bicycle touring.  Pictures I'd seen of the Coolpix 5700 made it look rather large and heavy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's virtually the same size and weight as my previous Coolpix 995 - like a compact 35mm camera. It also is the easiest to grip and manipulate of any camera I've owned - it seems to cling to your hand. I love the easy shutter release button. A complaint about previous Coolpix's was that for me pressing the overly stiff and \"clicky\" shutter release button would cause the camera to move. No so with the 5700.I love the fact that there is a large, REAL lens cap, cleverly designed so that it simply moves out with the zoom if you forget to take the cap off before power-up. I also like the real hot flash shoe. This camera's a winner - the best of any I've had.", "Date": "December 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "My impression after a few days", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1LGHRERE5IN5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is a short summary of my experience with the camera the last few days.  For starters, this camera has an enormous feature set.  For a relative beginner like myself I had to read the entire manual - carefully.  You can take it out of the box using the default settings and take fantastic pictures however I ran into a number of issues until I started reading.The camera battery charges in about 2 hours - which is great.  The battery was only lasting about 70 minutes at first but after asking someone why it was \"clicking\" all the time I found out it has a default setting of continuous auto-focus.  This keeps the image in the viewfinder sharp but is much harder on the battery.  I changed the setting to focus only when I press the shutter release halfway down and now get about 90 minutes battery life.I initially had a problem with the auto focus not locking on in low light.  After changing a couple settings it is much better.  Tonight I finally tried out the picture previews.  Looking through the viewfinder, I found a photo I took where I wasn't sure if the subject had closed their eye's or not.  They were standing a short distance away and on the small LCD I couldn't tell.  Once the picture was selected, I used the zoom feature and went in for a close up.  I could see, plain as day that it was a keeper.  Some people might not consider this a big deal however at a family reunion or similar special occasion you want to know if you need to get another while there's still a chance.  I will also point out that while I scrolled through the images and zoomed in (still in preview mode) they were very responsive.  I expected some lag while panning around but it was trivial.The Electronic View Finder seems kind of strange to me however I'm rapidly growing accustomed to it.  I've heard you can have trouble getting \"action\" shots with it due to the lag behind real life and it updating.  The delay seems to be about 1/20th of a second.  Since you can lock the focus for a distance you expect something to happen and select a program to compensate for your choice of a faster shutter speed, I haven't had a problem with sports.  I actually find it easier than an SLR.  I've never been able to manually rotate that stupid focus ring in time to catch anything.  This is similar - prefocus approximately where it's going to happen.  The auto focus takes about 1 second in well lit areas but might hunt if it's too dark, zoomed in too far or a combination of both / contrast.I've heard a few people complain that the eyelet on the right side jabs them in the palm when holding the camera.  I'm not sure where they grab it but I found that it fits perfectly in front of the webbing of my index and middle finger - doesn't touch.  Also on the left side there are a series of buttons on the lens housing.  I've never come close to bumping these.  It never occurred to me to hold it that way.  With my left hand I support the camera with my thumb and index finger from the bottom, centered under the lens.  To use the buttons I rotate my thumb up.The flash is centered well above the center of the lens.  I believe this contributes significantly to the near elimination of red-eye.  I don't think I've caught even a trace of it so far.  Also the red eye option from the flash menu actually lights up a white light on the camera positioned just below the shutter release and power switch.  This has also worked well and avoids the \"strobe\" effect of the flash prior to actually firing.  I always thought that was annoying.  My only complaint with the camera is that it doesn't have a factory option to use filters.  There are third party products to get around this, most notable is device that screws into the tripod bracket and has an adjustable arm that sticks out in front of the camera and will hold a filter in front of the lens.  I haven't purchased one yet, but plan to.  Before spending the kind of cash that this one is going to set you back, go to a local store and feel one in your hands.  I think it's a fantastic piece of engineering, built very solid with the largest feature set I've seen in a single camera (without cutting corners).  If you make a living  with your camera then I'm sure you will find it's missing some spinbobulator that just doesn't cut it in your case however it's a lot of fun to use and will satisfy the needs and growth of almost anyone that doesn't truely require the giant step up to a D-SLR.", "Date": "March 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "It's a camera you can get into.", "Author": "Robert J Crooks \"bob30249\"", "ReviewID": "R3QLDHT34XV6PU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I've got to say is that this camera is great!

Both are excellent camera of its class.  Now I switch to Nikon Coolpix 5700, and realized this is THE camera to own if money is no object.  Nikon's metering system with build-in speed light create excellent night time pictures.  The focusing is excellent at daytime, and a little slower at night, but by manually adjusting the ISO setting, Apeture and shutter speed, you can easily get an excellent night time picture.  The size of the camera is bigger than most compact, but much smaller than most SLR camera.  Easily held with just one hand, comfort grib, and the magnesium alloy body is professionally built.The lens, oh man, the lens, is the best feature because of Nikon's ED lens, 8x optical zoom, this camera can easily shoot sporting event pictures with ease.  The 5-megapixel prints are unbelieveable.  The best thing about a high mega-pixel camera is that you take the picture, you CROP the picture down, and it's still so detail and clear.I have always kept my Nikon N70, even when I was using the kodak DC4800.  Now, I can truly say that I will be selling my Nikon N70, and my two lens, because the new Nikon Coolpix 5700 replace the performance of my Nikon N70, and it's 8x zoom lens is almost the equivalent of my 35-80mm and 70 to 300mm lens.Keep in mind that this camera does consume power, a fully charged battery will only last about 70 minutes, because both the LCD display or the eletronic viewfinder consume power.Unfortunately, I brought my Nikon 5700 from a New York retailer that sent me a japanese model, but it's still the same camera, only that if it breaks down, Nikon will now repair it, even if you want to pay cash for the repair.  Therefore, if you worry about camera breaking down, you have to make sure it's a USA model.  One last thing, there are too many features the camera have for me to mention here.  The most important point is that this camera has all major control of a profession SLR if you want to use it, it also can be fully automated to take picture with your worry.

My only previous digital experience was derived from using the still frame feature on my camcorder, which was completely automatic. The Coolpix was easy to use, right out of the box. It took me about a half hour to learn the basic controls of the Coolpix, and another half hour to learn the complex functions of it, contrary to the horror stories I've heard of people having a difficult time with learning how to use this camera.  The Coolpix is versatile and powerful. Its 8x optical zoom is incredible, especially for birding and sports, and beats almost every 5-megapixel camera out there. While its digital zoom is a temptation, however, it really isn't necessary and almost certainly will degrade the picture quality. At night, I've shot star trails by activating noise reduction and using a tripod and cable shutter release accessory for the Coolpix camera line. I've even used a special adapter and connected the camera to my telescope, and have obtained wonderful pictures of the moon, nebulae, and the planets. This is made possible because the 5700 has very low noise at its ISO 100 and 200 settings. At my school, I've taken pictures for the yearbook, and when I submitted the prints I made, the moderator asked me about the film I used. The quality of the results clearly matches that of film cameras, as the yearbook moderator didn't even realize I had used digital.  I do however have several gripes. Those who have used SLR cameras will dislike the shutter lag in the camera. Once you press the shutter release button, the camera hesitates before taking the picture. This is a drawback for sports. Also, battery life is short, about 40 minutes to a charge. Furthermore, autofocus can be inaccurate indoors sometimes. This may just be a result of the lighting scheme of my house, but since the camera has no autofocus assist light, focussing is sometimes difficult in poor lighting. Additionally, the noise level in the ISO 400 is moderately high and, at ISO 800, images I've taken are unacceptable for most purposes.  I would not allow these issues, however, to draw you away from the camera. Some won't even be issues for a lot of people. I'd give the camera 4 and a half stars, rounding up to five, because many of the aforementioned minor problems I've had are common in digital cameras and some I've noticed because just I use the 5700 in ways I doubt Nikon even conceived (using it for astrophotography, for instance) In 6 months, I've taken nearly 3,000 pictures with the 5700, and have been beyond satisfied with its overall performance. It can satiate many desires in a camera. The picture quality is absolutely impeccible. If you do purchase this camera, however, do buy at least a 256MB memory card - Nikon only supplies you with a 16MB card, enough to hold 6 pictures at a low compression ratio and full image size.

Following the lead of the rest of the Nikon family, this camera has a very slow autofocus.  On top of that, it is HORRIBLE to focus in low light.  Fortunately, most users of this type of camera are not taking night time candid or action photos, if you need to you will have to buy a SLR to get the performance you will need.  This camera is excellent for daylight and \"around the house\" photography.2. Make sure you buy a fast memory card.  If you buy a standard Compact Flash card you will be waiting up to a minute between photos while it saves if you use the higher resolution.  The card that comes with the camera only holds about 5 photos, so plan on buying a card with the camera.  3.

It has 5 megapixels, 8x optical zoom (which gives a range of 35-280 in 35mm equivalent), a swivel LCD screen, and electronic viewfinder (EVF).  EVF shows you what the lens sees, so this is an SLR-type camera, except the lens cannot be changed.  The built-in Nikkor lens is actually very high-quality and is designated ED by Nikon: the ED stands for extra-low dispersion, refering to the high-quality glass used to make the lens.The lens, in fact, is the best part of the 5700 at the after-rebate price: if you want to get a professional-quality zoom lens for a low, low price, the 5700 gives you a lot of bang for the buck, so you are basically getting a capable 5MP digital camera for free.  On the other hand, the 5700 is showing its age in other departments: auto-focus capability (esp. problematic in low light situations), processing speed, shutter lag, etc.  More recent models such as the Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 have better functions and are better supported by Nikon, and also have better picture quality plus more pixels.  (Remember: pixel count does not equal picture quality, just like hard drive capacity has nothing to do how fast a computer is.)In summary, while the 5700 was top-of-the-class two years ago when I first played with it -- and its professional zoom lens is fantastic -- it's showing its age as a digital camera and is effectively a discontinued model.  If you want an SLR-type digital camera, consider the newer Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 or the latest G-series from Canon or other similar cameras from Fujifilm or Konica Minolta.On the other hand, for semi-serious photography without spending too much money, the after-rebate 5700 makes a terrific value.", "Date": "December 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "Maybe I Got A Lemon", "Author": "B.

Batteries are available quite reasonably if you are willing to shop for them. I've been paying 18 before shipping and will get two more to make it a total of 5 which includes the one with the camera.Pictures are what count! Resolution is so far great.

VERY Strange; 4) proprietary battery, whose life with autofocus and fill-in speedlight available runs 30-40 minutes.Output quality even at normal setting is superb. With enough time and effort I'm confident I'll master the WEALTH of possibilities, but it is a complicated camera if one wishes to master the variety of options. Easy to use at auto-everything setting. Lots more control possible with various User Settings 1, 2, or 3. I'd recommend one or more 512 high-speed Compact Flash cards as a minimum, unless you stay mighty close to your computer, and I'd get at least three additional Nikon batteries.

We tried taking baby pictures in indoor lighting and it was simply hopeless. The AF essentially \"gives up\" in low lighting ... a stupid design flaw, as is the lack of easy use of filters and a complex set buttons, wheels, switches, etc. In decent lighting this is an EXTREMELY capable camera, with gorgeous output. For very little more the 8700 is far more capable of working in a low-light environment.", "Date": "May 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9WBTYKK6ZSK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent digital camera.  For the past several years I have had a Nikon Coolpix 950.  While it did a good job, I have used Nikon 35 mm cameras for decades and the unusual shape of the Coolpix 950 never felt as comfortable to hold and use as a 35 mm. Also, the 950 was too menu driven to make it quick and easy to use.  Problems solved with the Coolpix 5700!  Although it is smaller than any 35 mm I've ever owned, it still has the familiar shape.  It is also less menu driven, with several buttons that allow you to easily access features so that you can keep your eye on your subject, rather than having to flip through lengthy menus.  While there is an extensive menu system, Nikon has provided 4 different user settings, 3 of which you can customize with whatever features you want so that you do not have to constantly be searching through menus to set the camera up for different situations.  I have one user setting set up for ease of aperture priority use, another set up for shutter priority use, the third set up for complete manual use. Switching from one user setting to another is easy and can be done while keeping your eye on your subject.I admit that the camera could have actually benefited from being slightly larger, but overall it has a good solid feel and easy to use layout. (People with very large hands might disagree). Only criticisms:  (1)  The lens is not threaded for filters!!  There is a substantial piece of glass in front of this camera and the only way to protect it is to buy some goofy extension tubes and put a filter on that.  This is very poor designing for a camera that is intended for advanced amateurs and \"prosumers.\" (2)  The auto focus is a little slow.  Overall, the lag time for this camera is significantly better than my 950, as well as most other digitals, but the auto focus can sometimes be a little slow and finicky with certain subjects.  (3)  The LCD monitor on the back is a little too small. Again, the camera would have benefited from a little larger overall size, which would include a little larger monitor on the back.  The monitor on my old 950 is substantially larger.  (4)  Nikon needs to package this camera with at least a 64 MB CF card (or better yet a 128), instead of the almost useless 32 MB card that it currently comes with.  (I heard that earlier production models came with only a 16MB card!!).All of that having been said, this is a GREAT camera.  I haven't experienced any of the problems with the pop-up flash that others have reported.  Perhaps this was an issue with some of the earlier production models.  Included in the box is a battery charger, which was an excellent idea on Nikon's part.  (There is nothing worse than buying a new toy and you can't even play with it because you can't charge the batteries).  5 MP is awesome, the picture color and balance is superb, and the extensive list of features and flexibility is astounding.

Don't. The Nikon D70 is out and nothing can compare to a true SLR. If you still want to read go ahead.Having shot close to 5,000 pictures with this camera, take my word for it, the Coolpix 5700 is an excellent camera. It does however have a few limitations which stop me from recommending it whole heartedly. Lets start with the negatives first. 1. At anything above ISO 200 film speed the pictures start showing a lot of noise (this however is true with almost all digital cameras). However if you get a regular sized printout of your picture the noise is not that apparent, blowing up the picture is another matter though. Also if you're always going to keep the camera on auto mode, you need not worry about this problem, the folks at Nikon know the limitations of the camera and don't let it go into higher film speed modes in automatic mode.2. The enormous amounts of options, menus, buttons etc. can be bewildering at first. Again if you're only pointing and shooting on auto mode, this is not that worrisome a problem. And honestly i bought the camera specifically because it had so many options! Having said that Nikon could have found better ways to get to the most useful options quickly. This camera almost rules out spontaneous picture taking because by the time you've set it up the way you want it, the moment is long gone.3. The 32 MB card included with the camera is way too small. 256 MB would have been better. IBM's 1GB Microdrive is best.4. In low light conditions the Coolpix gets confused and finds it hard to focus quickly. Migrating from a film based SLR (also a Nikon) I found this problem to be a bit annoying. Also the Coolpix is not happy taking action or sports shots which require quickness from the camera.5. Like any other camera, digital zoom is just marketing nonsense. It almost always makes the picture worse, buy the telephoto lens if you need more zoom. But with an 8X zoom lens (35-280 mm equivalent), you really won't need anything else. Having pointed out all the negatives let me just say now that the camera is excellent. The picture quality is awesome, and if you are really into photography, playing with all the options available in the user modes is great fun. I personally have one mode set up for Black & White pictures, another one for continuous picture taking and the third one for manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speeds. The other digital camera I own is a Minolta Dimage F100. Even though that is a great little camera its biggest fault is the fact that it uses up batteries like there's no tomorrow. With the Nikon that problem is solved by the rechargable EN-EL1 battery, which can operate for about 2 hours continuously and can take about 150 pictures on one charge. I was put off with EVF (Electronic viewfinder) initially, as it cannot compare to an SLR's view. But i've gotten used to it overtime and i find that it actually works quite well. And there's always the option to use the highly adjustable LCD monitor at the back. Ultimately, the best thing about the 5700 is ofcourse the versatility that only a digital camera can provide. You take a picture, look at it, say ah-ah this is not exactly what i wanted, tweak the settings try again, and so on, until you get that perfect picture. In summary, the Coolpix 5700 has all the goodies you'd expect from one of the best camera manufacturers in the world. Don't buy it as a replacement for an SLR because it isn't (though it comes close). It is simply the best prosumer digital camera out there, and in my case it has made me a better photographer than i ever was before.

The contrast detection technique is definitely more accurate as the camera precisely knows which part of the picture it is analyzing. The infrared beam bouncing is not equally as accurate, and it requires that the lens has a great depth of field so that the picture is compensated for slight inaccuracies in focusing.

After shipping my baby off to Nikon, I received one of those form letters in the mail, informing me that the repair would cost $203.00 dollars and listing -$203.00 warranty allowance with a net of $00.00.  No additional information of any kind about the problem.  (In other words...\"Trust us\")  At the bottom of the form were instructions for logging in to nikonusa.com and approving the repair.  Ok...since there are no charges, they're going to sit on my camera and not repair it until authorized to do so?  Exactly why did they think I sent it to them anyway?  So I logged in and clicked in the approval checkbox.  The window went away and gave me no response of any kind either there or in email to indicate acknowledgement of the approval.  So what if the web connection malfunctioned?...or the programming was less than stellar?  How would I know except that my camera would never be repaired?  A week later, I received my baby in the mail...took it out of the box and read the included form (yes, another form with no contact name).  It said two boards had been replaced.  I turned it on and it came alive!  I tried to take a photo...but couldn't!!! because they obviously had not tested it and the entire panel of adjustment buttons on the left side of the camera were non-functional!!!  At this point, I'm not very happy.  There was an 800 number on the form returned with the camera and I actually was able to speak with a live person and explain the problem.  She was wonderful and sent me a pre-paid shipping form in email.I sent it back (per instructions) and am right back where I started with trying to get some response or information out of the nameless corporate entity.SUMMARY:  I love my camera...I hate the way the Service web pages have been programmed and the protective walls that have been put up to prevent me from talking with a live person.  Dear Nikon...if you won't talk to me, just who do you think is going to buy your next camera line?", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exceeds my Expectations", "Author": "\"ducksquat\"", "ReviewID": "RI2II24AC6AZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my Nikon Coolpix 5700 just before our October trip to experience the New England foliage. Wow, just in time! This is a wonderful camera in every sense of the word. I'll give you the good and then the bad.THE GOOD:The lense is by far one of the best on the market as evidenced by the clarity and sharpeness. The zoom is very handy and I was able to close in on far off mountains, eagles, etc. It's a good size for my hands and I'm 6'3\", a big guy to say the least. Whether you are into all the gizmos that SLR's offer or simply want a point and shoot, this is wonderful. You can save settings for various situations. For example, I have one setting for dark indoor places, another for cloudy days, and another for macro shots. My wife hates gadgets and I taught her how to simply switch it to automatic and she loves it too! The camera doesn't feel cheap, but rather, amazingly sturdy.The 5 megapixels come in handy since I am shooting to find the best to use as original art in my home. My sister-in-law is so impressed that I'm now her photographer instead of the costly studios when shooting her newborn. Hey, I'm not a professional either and the camera made me look like an expert!THE BAD:Yeah, the clicking and whirring is annoying but if you know how to read and comprehend decently, you'll understand ways to focus differently in certain situations. Those that complain are either impatient or might be lacking in the comprehension department.Attachments are a great plus such as the 2x close up lens or whatever. Hoever, they will take about 10 - 20 seconds to get out and set up for various shots which is annoyance. Having said that, isn't it about the same for a true SLR camera too? I wish the filters would go directly over the lense but instead, it goes over the attachment meaning that you will not get full range of your 8x lense because the attachment doesn't allow for full extension. Sometimes, I get the dreaded barrel look so I think I'll look into a wider lense to make up for the barrel.Batteries go fast! However, I have one backup and a quick recharger that can be charged in the cigarette lighter of my car. Keep 'em charged and you are fine. With both batteries, I can fill up 526MB card without problems as long as my saving mode is relatively short.BOTTOM LINE:Great prosumer camera.

The range of choices in the 5700 for exposure, contrast, focus and all the other things that affect the quality of a photograph, make it an excellent choice for the advanced amateur. None of the other prosumer digital cameras can match the 5700 in features. But I found it was also a great choice for a wanna-be prosumer like me, since the large number of choices allows one to learn about photography by firing away a hundred photos at different settings, then seeing how the choices affect the results (the EXIF data, which tells what exposure, contrast, shutter speed and a whole bunch of other settings were used in taking a particular photograph, are saved with each picture).  Unlike similar strategies in the film camera world, this costs almost nothing, since the cost of taking a photo with a digital camera is about zero.  Point and shoot is easy, but you don't learn anything when that is all you do.The weakest feature is low light focus (more accurately,low contrast focus).  Weakest, that is, if the photographer does not know how to use some easy techniques to help solve it.  Its not as bad as some would claim.Especially strong features to me are the general quality of the photos, the excellent macro (closeup) shot capability, the 8X telephoto capability, the relatively compact size, the continuous shot feature, which takes rapid multiple shots for as long as you keep the button pressed, the \"best shot selector\", which selects the sharpest photo out of many under adverse shooting situations and saves only that photo to the card (this is a feature found in no other camera) and auto \"bracketing\", which allows successive shots at different exposures when you don't know which exposure setting might be the best.I've had the camera for about 6 months now and taken thousands of pictures.

It's the second digital camera for me -- so I have something to compare it against.  The first one was a FujiPhoto with very similiar features, but 2.3 Mpixels.  If you haven't owned a digital camera I can see where you might think the Nikon is difficult to use.  After having explored and used all the features, I give the Nikon an \"A\" for ease of use.  The advantage is that the features most often needed are available through readily available buttons, thumbwheels, or a combination of the two as opposed to deeply nested screen menus.  If all you want to do is shoot vacation photos, you shouldn't spend $$$$ for a camera.  On the other hand, to take advantage of the camera you must spend a few hours with the manual and machine.  The Nikon will reward you.The quality is noticeably better -- for at least two reasons.  One, the Nikon has 5 Mpixels and then the Nikon glass is reputed to be very good.  The lens seems to make for about 2/3 the size and weight of the camera.  I'm not sure you would notice the difference between 3x5 photos taken at the company picnic, but get into the fine or high size and use the macro lens for closeup photos of flowers and the detail stands out.On the critical side I have a few comments.  Someone else has mentioned the size of the review screen and I agree its a bit small -- smaller than the Fuji even.  But then again it does swivel and the camera has a good viewfinder to boot.  I've adapted to the size without problem.  One annoyance I've found is having to reset the timer after each shot when shooting on the tripod.  I don't do that very often -- and who knows, maybe there's a way to set it that I haven't discovered yet.  This probably applies to most digital cameras, but for me some of the options are unneccessary (e.g., sharpness, contrast, etc.).  I think the filters are better applied through photo software on the computer.  I do like the noise reduction feature, though, for long exposures.  It seems to do a better job erasing those little white spots than the computer.I like the camera and will enjoy using it.  You'll need a case for all the pieces, a CompactFlash with at least 256Mb, and an extra battery.  I also recommend a CompactFlash reader so you don't have to hook the camera to the computer and an SB-30 Nikon Speedlight flash.

Plus, it takes 4-5 seconds after u press the trigger before it takes the picture. This is the ONLY problem with the 5700.

I started out with it as a complete novice, got shutter lucky, and found some beautiful shots in the camera. Over the past months I've moved from a completely automatic point-and-shoot snapper to all-manual settings. I've picked up some knowledge about the basics of photography along the way, and the ability to pop the card and see the results of a setting instantly really shortened the learning curve.First and foremost, this camera takes absolutely beautiful photographs. Colors are bright and vibrant, and details are rendered beautifully even when printing at large sizes - you can get a 13x19\" enlargement to print at about 140 dpi on an inkjet, resulting in a very \"painterly\" image somewhere between photograph and painting. I decided at the outset to shoot only in camera RAW mode, and so what I've gotten out of the camera is exactly what went in. If you need to re-touch in Photoshop, this is the ONLY way to do it. You can correct a surprising number of mistakes (white balance, exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation) in RAW prior to bashing the image to smithereens with Photoshop editing tools - they only work on processed, \"rendered\" images.Downsides are well id'd in the reviews, but I think you can get around most of them. Battery consumption climbs closer and closer to the top of the list of negatives as you move from automated to manual operation. Tip: use manual focus. I've found that assigning manual focus to the function button on the top makes focusing easier than punching for the button on the lens barrel. There isn't anything you can do about slow memory card writes, and we're not likely to see any firmware updates to accept the faster WA cards out on the market.I've added some filters and lenses to my rig. A good tripod is essential, and the AA battery pack, with a 15-minute charger, makes everything a lot more fun. Note that if you add Nikon lenses, you are permanently out of luck for filters - there are NO filters for the Nikon lenses and adapters that fit this camera. Luckily, there are very acceptable third-party lenses and adapters that will take UV and/or polarizing filters.I'm no pro, don't even consider myself a photographer yet, but the folks who work with my wife don't know that.

The main reason why I didn't get the minolta was the battery choice they made.  My first digital camera (Agfa ephoto 1680) used AA and it ran out within an hour of using it and swore I'd never do it again.  That camera was only a 1.?

Yes, the autofocus can take some time--luckily I'm not shooting any type of action.  And it can hunt for quite a while in low light, but use of a tripod almost always fixes the problem.  The lens is amazing.  I've done a lot of still life work with the camera--just zooming in all the way from about 2 to 3 feet away, not even setting the camera in \"macro\" mode--and the quality of the resulting photographs is completely amazing.  The Nikon 5700 is pricey, but it's because of the lens.  The lens makes the camera worth the extra $$$.  I did have one problem with the camera, which was it started dramatically over- or under-exposing after exposing 2 or 3 images.  I was about to put it int he box and ship it back to Nikon for repair, when I decided to reset all the settings back to the factory defaults--which fixed the problem.  Some reviewers have noted how the buttons onthe left side of the lens barrel are easy at accidentally press while shooting.  Apparently that's what I did.  The camera is very small and light, and I agree with many reviewers who say that it is too small/light.  I purchased the optional battery pack.  Not only does it let you use standard AA rechargables, it adds enough bulk to the camera to make shooting seem more \"normal\" for someone raised on Nikon SLRs.  It also adds a second shutter release and zoom control for shooting in Portrait mode--doesn't sound liek a big deal until you use it, then you realize how completely cool it is, especially if you shoot as many portraits as me.  Most of my photography is black-and-white.  Not only does the Nikon 5700 let you take pictures directly in black-and-white, but because it uses a digital viewfinder, the can visualize your photographs in bakc-and-white before you take them!  This is a very cool feature.  Another feature I've found useful for portrait photography is the video cable that comes with the camera.  Plug on end into the camera and the other end into your TV, and you can use your TV as a giant viewfinder to compose your photographs!  Overall, the Nikon 5700 is a tremendous camera.

When I bought the 5000, I found four things I didn't like about it: Not enough telephoto, flash sensor in bad location resulting in severly underexposed flash photos, on/off switch a little difficult to use, and the lens cap had to be removed in order to turn on the camera. The 5700 corrects all of these things with up to 280 mm (35 mm equivalent) maximum focal length. The on/off switch is just like the one on the 5000 but it is easier to turn. Both the 5000 and 5700 seem to be the same camera as far as features and quality are concerned. The LCD monitor on the 5700 is a little smaller but it is clear and sharp. The 5700 has an electronic view finder which I was concerned about before I was able to try it out. It is just a miniature LCD monitor and it is surprisingly good, even in low (relative) light conditions. Only one monitor can be on at a time which saves power consumption. It is a little deeper in size than the 5000, but that's necessitated by the long focal length of this camera. I love using this camera. I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix 5700 camera.Update after 3 months.  I recently took my 5700 and my N80 with me on a vacation to Colorado and Utah visiting nat'l parks.  I like the electronic view finder very much as it displays what the picture will look like with any adjustments I have set, i.e. exposure compensation.  I never took my N80 out of its bag.

This rendered the camera useless, disabling all but one shooting mode. And since the feedback was just a cryptic blinking red light and a code \"SB\" (defined nowhere in the manual or online), it took forever to determine I hadn't simply activated the wrong setting--this was a defect that required repair. I sent it in under warranty in the nick of time and got it back about a month later. It worked for maybe two more months and failed again. Same story.

I have had this camera for a little over a month and am ready to throw it out the window.AUTO FOCUS PROBLEMSThe thing can't take a picture that's in focus.  At one to one, out of the 958 pictures I've taken, none of them are sharp.  It simply can't do it.  Many subjects it can't focus at all.  Its impossible to judge from the tiny monitor the true sharpness of the photo. Its not uncommon to review a batch of photos on the computer and find that half of them are completely fuzzy.The auto focus is also extremely slow.  It can take several seconds for the camera find its mark.MANUAL FOCUS IS A JOKEThe manual focus is awkward to use.  Although, that's prety much irellevant because the camera's monitor does not have enough resolution to use it.  Its been suggested to me that I try bracketing the focus.  Except, the point of bracketing is not to be aimlessly wasting memory, hoping that one of the shots is good.TIGHTEST APERATURE IS 8.7I thought I could deal with this because most of the work I do is in moderate to low light.  That was a mistake.  This compounds the previously mentioned Auto Focus issues.HIGH RESOLUTIONThe difference from a 35mm film scan is astounding.  Its amazing to pull up a 6X9 at 300 ppi with no noise or grain.EASY TO USEThe camera is set up like the 35mm SLR I've used for years to and have found it easy to navigate.  The buttons on the side can be touched accidentally causing some minor annoyance.CONCLUSIONIf you are a casual user, this camera may be just fine for you.  The focusing issues become pronounced when you are trying to achieve a specific aestetic.  Perfect focus may not be that important to you eighter, especially if you print mostly to 4x6 or 5x7.

Not for action.", "Author": "Aaron Contorer", "ReviewID": "R3N385PWQ4UKMF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Note: I have revised this review, originally written August 2002, to reflect the fact that better cameras are now on the market from other manufacturers.]If you are an advanced amateur -- someone who likes to take really nice pictures for aesthetic reasons, in additon to occasional ordinary snaps -- this camera will impress you with its quality.Having now tried several thousand shots under varying conditions, I am quite pleased with the Nikon Coolpix 5700. It was a good purchase, and worth the price. The photo quality is definitely comparable to most 35mm cameras. The camera combines subtle color sensitivity, good brightness sensitivity, and extreme detail in the images. The range of the zoom lens is wonderful. Controls are available for almost everything an advanced amateur would want. The included software (with included USB cable) makes image transfer to the PC, and previewing a big set of photos, very easy.You NEED to read the manual to use the advanced features of this camera. You can leave it set to full-auto, hand it to a friend, and just say \"press here to take a picture,\" but to get the full benefit of the camera you'll need to understand some rather elaborate controls, some of which are un-guessable. After I invested 90 minutes to read the manual, my shots went from good to breathtaking. Since getting this camera I have not taken one single photo using my rather nice Canon EOS 35mm film camera -- it's all digital for me now.Though the camera is far smaller than \"8x zoom\" would lead you to believe, and smaller than an SLR camera, you'll still want to use two hands. And there is no way you'll be putting it in any sort of pocket -- it's not something you'll carry around just in case you want to take a snapshot.The single included battery lasts for well over 100 shots, assuming you don't use the flash much AND you use the viewfinder instead of the larger preview monitor. But frequent flash use drains it quickly, so if that's your need, order a second battery. And you'll NEED a larger memory card (128 to 512 MB is reasonable), so go ahead and order the extra memory card now.There are lots of semi-advanced features for the photo buff -- too many to list here. If you like messing with settings and trying different things, you'll like this camera. If you just want to turn it on and shoot without thinking, this is not the model for you.The main weaknesses I'd still like to see improved all relate to action photography: (1) a noticeable delay between pressing the button and taking the shot; (2) a slow auto-focus motor, sometimes painfully slow ;(3) high-speed shooting only at low resolution. One other weakness is that resolution in the new digital viewfinder is not even close to the sharpness of a normal 35mm SLR optical viewfinder -- it doesn't show you enough pixels.A further very real weakness is that this camera has extreme difficulty auto-focusing in dim light. Even if you intend to use a flash, that doesn't help the camera focus. And due to the above-mentioned viewfinder, you can't manually focus very well with this camera. So if you intend to shoot much in very dim light (e.g., indoors at night), this is NOT the model to choose.While there is room for improvement, and it's showing its age vs the competition, this camera is feature-packed and fun to use and takes photos of the highest quality. And you could not pry the 8x optical zoom lens away from me now that I've seen what it can do -- I could not go back to my previous digicam with 3x optical zoom.If you want to read even more, the \"Steve's Digicams\" reviews website has extensive details on this fine camera.

Nikon has introduced a new 8700 model, but I am not yet convinced that it's actually better -- higher number of pixels doesn't help, if the quality of the pictures is worse (so far, the jury does not yet seem to have come back with a verdict on that issue).  Nikon also has their D1 and D2 series now (true professional SLRs, with the D2H being the first ever that is truly suitable for professional sports photographers), as well as the D70.But for prosumers, being able to see the picture on the LCD display as you are framing the shot, is very, very important.  It's also important to be able to see the display when you are holding the camera at odd angles.  The Canon 300D (a.k.a., Digital Rebel) is a good entry-level digital SLR, and is the first to allow you to see the picture on the LCD display as it is being framed.  But the display doesn't flip out and twist, unlike almost all the other truly successful prosumer digicams.If/when Nikon can come out with an SLR camera with the kind of resolution of the D70 (and the ability to change lenses, etc... like all SLRs), but with a flip-n-twist LCD display like the 5700/8700, they will permanently take the market back from Canon.

I usually shoot in jpeg mode at the highest resolution, with 128 mb of memory.

Battery life is poor, less than half the life I get with another camera that uses four NIMH AA's. Both the viewfinder and view screen could be brighter. When shooting in sunlight, it's pretty much a guessing game to compose a shot. I've resigned myself to shooting lots of exposures and sorting them out after downloading to the computer.

However, an extra battery is a MUST. That's why Nikon included the external battery charger with the camera, you can charge a battery while you use one (my old Sony had a power supply that plugged into the camera, which tied up the camera during charging times.)- I usually install a UV filter on my SLR cameras to protect the lens, I failed to find a UV filter for the 5700 and no adapters are available yet for it.

I'm giving this review as someone who is relatively new to digital \"point-and-shoot\" photography...First and foremost, study the Nikon manual. Then study it some more. The controls are overwhelming at times, provided you are a neo-phyte like myself.Second, for exterior photography on the normal setting, this camera cannot be beat! It is exceptional. The images are clear, clean, and colors are spectacular. I've photographed NASCAR at the California Speedway, and other events like the Coronado Speed Festival, etc., and the outdoor shots look great. Now for the indoor-shooting...This is where the camera gets its two star rating from me. I do not know how to select the manual control on-the-fly. I've tried to set up controls to shoot indoor photography, but I don't have weeks and weeks to learn the settings. I've photographed people who are standing completely still, slightly moving (my kids), low lighting conditions, fair lighting conditions, and still cannot get proper images to come out.The indoor photography is pitiful, as the colors are yellowish, muted, and nearly 90% of the time, the images are all blurred. The pop-up light is only good for 5-8 feet at best. I took some special shots of people who were stationary, and it appeared that the photo looked \"good\" when zooming in and out with the control. When I downloaded the CF card to my PC, the images were always blurred and the colors were way off.Mind you, I'm not a camera professional like many of the reviewers here, but rather I'm just an average \"Joe\" who would like to have decent indoor pictures that looked natural and were not blurred.I would sell this thing on Ebay if I could get more than a few hundred dollars for it, but I've already invested over $1,200 for the snap-on lens adaptors and protective lens cover which keeps the retractable lens from getting damaged. I bought this from a company in Canada back in 2003.All in all I'm happy with the exterior photos, but am very, very, disappointed with indoor pictures.

This is when you can really get creative with your photos.  Although in auto mode, it does a super job.  I bought this camera for it's manual capabilities and the many accessories you can add to it.  I strongly recommend to only buy Nikon accessories.  They are pricier but you know you are not getting anything generic or substandard.  I also highly recommend taking the time to learn it and read the manual.  This way you will be able to use the camera to its full potential.  Many of other reviewer's \"frustration\"  come from the fact that they didn't take the time to learn the camera.  Also, if you take it to your nearest camera dealer, they will be more than happy to show you it's many awesome features.", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Complicated camera, lacks some basic features", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RJ605KFGZ0KRX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera when it first came out based on the rave reviews of the photo quality.  Indeed, it takes great photos.  However, there are some basic design flaws and ommisions that I felt were critical enough to get rid of it and replace it with a different camera.  The location of some the buttons is just wrong.  It is easy to inadvertently change a setting just by trying to hold the camera.The setup and menus are VERY complicated...much more confusing that any of the 5 other digicams I've owned.  It also doesn't alow you to rotate the photos for correct display on a TV set....even my $300 Canon does that....and the Canon automatically displays each photo correctly.  The most significant ommision, however, is the lack of a focus assist-lamp for low-light conditions.  Since it's virtually impossible to manually focus a digital camera, you need a reliable auto-focus.  We found that even in modest low-light settings we couldn't get it to focus.  My wife was so frustrated with it that she wouldn't even use it.  We replaced it with a Canon which we are very happy with.", "Date": "May 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2CR4AL238HJST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent photo quality.

The zoom action is wonderful.  And yes, I like the small lightweight size ~ such a difference from my SLR.I have found the menus and manual modes very easy to learn.  I've just had the camera a couple weeks but I'm thrilled with it.I do have a **QUESTION** for other Nikon Coolpix 5700 owners:I bought a 256m Sandisk Compact Flashcard along with the camera, as recommended by one of your reviewers.  However, the Nikon manual states a flashcard range from 16-128m.  Before I open the packaging of the 256m I'd appreciate assurance that I am not limited to a 156m card, as I was with a previous digital camera.", "Date": "January 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Camera does not work", "Author": "carly", "ReviewID": "R3A31U161IEYV6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera does not work properly, it was a waste of money....I bought it for my daughters birthday, she has been ill for a long time and I wanted something she could sit in the garden with and take close up pictures....the camera only works when it wants to...she had a snail climbing in her viewfinder, the light was right, and the camera will not take the picture....so disappointed...I think I was sold a bogus camera...this is my first electronic purchase with Amazon...not happy", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I really like this camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1HOW9K4FP477D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had the camera two days, but I'm already enjoying it.  I was a little nonplussed to have buttons on the side that are on the back of my 995, but the focus is better, and it takes closeups (at the farthest focal length without going past what's between the W----T.  I learned with the 995, and this one is the same, that if you go to 1X, 2X or 4X, etc., you'd better have the camera on a tripod.  My 995 doesn't go on a tripod, and it doesn't even have a place to plug in a remote control switch, so I'm glad that this one does.  :)  I'm going to enjoy this camera very much.", "Date": "April 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "what a piece of JUNQUE", "Author": "radio100 \"radio100\"", "ReviewID": "R2MZ7C2IOMXR34", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I saved my nickels to buy a Nikon.

A friend of mine let me play with his new 5700 to see what I think about it.I first asked him the price he paid and although it is abit on the high side, i dismissed it initially and went on to the test if really this camera does deliver relative to its price. Controls are well placed, a nikon quality i like and the materials used are top-notched. However image quality is not what I expected. I have seen and tried digicams from Olympus and Minolta and they have better color reproduction and image saturation. Even the Fuji S7000 seems to have better \"printed image than the Nikon and to think that the Fuji only sells for U$600.00. If the Nikon were priced at least at the level of the others, I would be hard pressed not to reconsider it but it is no very competitive price and feature wise.", "Date": "December 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Most unreliable piece of equipment ever purchased", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HNKCLK7IC315", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I too fell into the \"if it is Nikon\" trap.  Afer reading many reviews on the camera, I purchased two as my first step into digital photography.  One for my wife and one for myself. We probalby have less than 1000 pictures on both combined.  My wife's has been sent in for repairs twice for the zoom lens not working.  I got mine out this morning to take a picture and the view finder and screen are both blank.  I'm not even going to wast 10 bucks to ship it back again for repair.  I still have several months left on the extended warrenty but it just not worth the effort.And...  everything about taking extremely long time to focus is true. This is the deciding reason for not having it fixed.  Even when it is working, it is a very aggrevating camera.  The number of good shots you miss while it tries to focus is unbelievable.Both of my Coolpix 5700 were pieces of junk.  It was a very expensive lesson about Nikon quality. With two cameras, additional lenses, battery packs, 1G memory disks, and extended warrenties, about 3K total.Since I've only owned two Nikons, I can truthfully say when the topic comes up, \"Every Nikon I owned was a piece of junk.
