I am new to photography and have not taken any classes except read like crazy. I've realized that the bundled lens 55-200 was useless, if I only knew I would have just bought the body and purchased the lens separately. O well I guess we learn as we go. I had to learn the hard way and my 1st month using the camera I have put 10,000 actuation on the camera, yes you read it right. The outcome was, now I am comfortable with Aperture priority, ISO, and Shutter speed. Which led me to night photography and just love every minute of it. I am still doing night photography but my composition had gotten better. [...]. Not bad for 2 months in photography.....September 17, 2012.
