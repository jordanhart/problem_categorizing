{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Security Sign & Decal Set", "Author": "Mary Hill \"Mary Prater Hill\"", "ReviewID": "RMZLZMUN2AXT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When we upgraded our security camera system from five cameras to ten, needed signage stating that audio was being used with video in one of the locations. This packet of decals and the yard sign fit that need perfectly. So far the decals have stayed on the doors I placed them on with only one that didn't want to stick to a wooden, painted surface. I just added some super glue and that problem was solved.  They all survived our 32 day run of temps over 100 degrees this summer, so hope that's the case when the snow and ice are hitting us this winter. If I can get three years out of this set before they need to be replaced, that will be fine. I would definitely purchase this set again.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004083NCU"}}
