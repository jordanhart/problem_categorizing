After charging a battery for seven hours it was still drained. Apparently, the battery and charger have to sit just wright in order to get the prongs to touch, you have to be careful of that. If the improved the charger I would have given it higher ratings", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent produtct!", "Author": "adetomas", "ReviewID": "R1WTTBBSY6ZB0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When we bought this camera we had some believes that the promises would not be fullfilled because, the description was precise but we thought it was a little bit exagerated...Our great suprise is that the camera exceededour expecations and it is doing everything they promise and more...Great product, excelletn optical zoom, better quality and easy to connect to share your memories...We are delighted!", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Comentario", "Author": "Adriana Alc\u00edvar", "ReviewID": "R27AHGEGR6QD1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es ideal para viajes largos tener una reserva o poder cargar tu c\u00e1mara en tu veh\u00edculo y seguir disfrutando de los recuerdos", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente!!!

The initial battery had an issue, but I called East Coast Photo and they quickly sent me a replacement at no charge. The new battery worked perfect and now I'm all set to take my camera on long trips. I only gave this four stars because the camera case itself is a bit tight, but it works fine and is of good quality.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't bother", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R1TO7TOO7LQEU9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The \"case\" is too small to even fit the camera.  So it is totally useless.  The battery charger is a car charger only, but inconveniently comes with a US to European plug adapter (totally useless and borderline dangerous) that doesn't even go with the charger. The battery is the only thing that might be functional, but it is the cheapest possible make.  Just don't bother with the set of products.  Buy a case that actually fits, a battery charger that is usable and why the heck it has the US to European adapter plus (that again won't work with the charger as it is only a car charger) I don't know... Wow, what a totally useless package.  I'd return it if the value of my time to do so wasn't worth more than the $27...DO NOT BUY!!!!", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice kit", "Author": "Bocker", "ReviewID": "R2RWLLLF8J4UJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice accessories.
