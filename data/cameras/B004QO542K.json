What a disappointment..twice.  The first time the camera image got fuzzier and fuzzier the more pictures it took until nothing.  Returned and bought another thinking maybe the first one was just a fluke.  Wrong!  The second camera would never even turn on. Vivitar can do better!  I ended up buying a totally different camera (Cannon sureshot).", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT buy this camera!", "Author": "Antonia", "ReviewID": "R1H6W4O3U6EVTW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've used a lot of digital cameras and can tell you that the Vivitar T207 is just dreadful. A program I worked for bought 21 of these cameras for a photography class I taught. The camera is fixed focus, even though it does have digital zoom, so it was very difficult for the children to take pictures that were in focus. The colors were off, except in photos taken in bright sunlight. (As far as I could tell the white balance does nothing.) The camera is made of cheap plastic and easily broken. (One kid put in the SD card backward and it got stuck in the camera; another child had the cover to the battery compartment break when she opened it.) On top of all that, there is no cover over the slot for the SD card and it is easy to loose the card. (I lost one.)I had to put scotch tape over the slot in each camera to be sure the SD cards did not fall out.There is no way to review more than the most recent picture in the camera, so you cannot see or show your shots until you remove the SD card and put it in a computer or iPad. This was frustrating to the children, and meant that I couldn't show them how to improve their shots while they were using the cameras.The instructions are cryptic, to put it kindly. I found that the kids easily hit the \"mode\" button, and were taking videos rather than still shots. The only way I could get the cameras to stop taping was to turn them off. And sometimes, the only way I could get a camera to turn off was to open the battery compartment and remove the batteries.Speaking of batteries, this camera is a power hog (as in it exhausts its batteries in about an hour of shooting.) On top of that, the T027 takes three AAA batteries. Having a camera use three batteries is inconvenient in itself because batteries usually come in packages of even numbers, and most chargers for rechargeable batteries hold four batteries. But when you have to change the batteries as often as you do with this camera, having three batteries is really annoying.Another weird thing about this camera was that, though the model number was the same on all 21 of the cameras, some could take higher resolution pictures than others. One would think that Vivitar wouldn't sell cameras with different features under the same model number. But .... So you can't even be sure you will get what you think you are ordering.I could go on, but I just sum up my experience by saying that I'd give the Vivitar ViviCam T027 12.1 Megapixel Compact Camera - Silver negative stars if Amazon allowed that. Stay away from this piece of junk, and don't even think of it as a camera for a child.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointment", "Author": "Sooz", "ReviewID": "R2G67ZKIZEO6G9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having joyfully used a Kodak Easy Share camera for 6 years, the Vivitar T027 camera is a huge disappointment.  Unfortunately I my Kodak was dropped and now photos blur.  I cannot believewhat a difference there is in small cameras.  The Vivtar is very hard to use. I have yet been able to make the flash work when needed, the photo quality is not good, the batteries run out too quickly.  I did not look at reviews before I bought it. I bought it in a store that was going out of business, or I would definitely return it.  I downloaded the user manual but that has not been of any help in learning to use it effectively.  Be sure you can try out camera before you buy it.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't bother with this trash", "Author": "Justasia \"College Student\"", "ReviewID": "R2C2Y2VP17RIDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst camera I have ever had. I received one last year as a gift. I've been fussing with the features for a year now and have yet to find a combination that will give me clear pictures in any lighting situation. No matter what, indoor or outdoor, flash or no flash, the photos are blurry and either over exposed or under exposed. My cell phone's 5MP camera takes better shots. Seriously, spend the extra money on a Cannon or Nikon. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfactory", "Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "R7C5X4SFJ6ZPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this camera and I love it. I use rechargeable AAA's, and they last for a fairly long time. The photos look better if taken in the outdoors, where they are crisp, clear, and vibrant. The pictures are clean and very good. When the pictures are taken in dim rooms the images become washed out with a greenish tinge and are very bad, even with the flash. The flash is very bright and reflects off the subjects of the photos, making them overexposed. Make sure the photos are taken in decent lighting, if not, there is not much you can do to make them better. Also, the flash cannot be permanently turned on or off and automatically turns off whenever the camera itself is turned off, making the use of flash a chore. The date and time setting also return to default of 1/1/01 or something whenever the batteries are taken out, which I guess is better than returning to default whenever the camera is turned off. The t207 is equipped with macro mode, which is used to take photos up close. If you try to take photos up close without macro mode they will be very blurry. Vivitar uses cheap LCD's for preview screens, which make the photos look grainy and blurry and dull at first glance, which gives the majority of people out there the impression that this takes bad photos, however, once they are uploaded onto your computer they look much nicer, as they should. The LCDs seem to all have a few dead pixels too, as I have owned a few of these cameras and they all have faulty LCDs. The materials used for construction are decent. The front is made of a strange brushed metal/plastic material which feels great and sturdy. The rear is of a shiny, slightly sparkly gray plastic. However the plastic band that runs around the sides of the camera that joins the front and back parts is painted with a cheap gray paint that flakes off and exposes the dull translucent plastic underneath, giving the camera a very ugly and worn look. The camera is a bit hollow and very light without the batteries, but when the batteries are installed it gives it more heft and weight. However, there is a small problem with the battery door where sometimes the camera will not turn on, and will only turn on after taking out the batteries and putting them back in (this is because the other half of the circuitry that provides power is in the battery door itself, and it is not always working at first. Overall, the camera takes excellent pictures (in decent lighting), feels great in the hand with acceptable build quality(except for the flaking gray band's paint and weird battery door), lasts a long enough time with my rechargeable batteries, and I am very satisfied with it.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Vivitar ViviCam T027 12.1 Megapixel Compact Camera - Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z7zhLxwQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004QO542K"}}
