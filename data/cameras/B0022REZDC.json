It looses the pictures constantly and the drivers are not all on the tiny diskette. Looking online the web site for Sakar does not have the divers either and there is no customer support at all.Only buy this as a toy for a 2 year old if it is marked down to $5.00 or less - NOT AS A REAL CAMERA.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "not great", "Author": "bellablack1", "ReviewID": "R179EZMLT55LG6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "got this thinking it would be a good to use to take pictures but wasn't it was no more then a child's toy the pictures were very crappy wouldn't recommend for older children", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap", "Author": "rssoccer", "ReviewID": "R30NABCUAZTSRB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 7-year old son for his birthday to give him something to play around with.  After reading the reviews, I didn't have high hopes for it, but thought I would take a gamble since it was intended to be a first camera.  After getting it, we turned it on once and took a few pictures and loaded them on the computer.  After that, the camera never turned back on.  We tried replacing batteries, but with no results.  So in short, the camera only lasted a day.  Like the other reviews say, there is no real memory.  So if the batteries come out or run out, the images on the camera will be gone.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke easy", "Author": "Valerie Craig", "ReviewID": "R2JJTZ6MA3O9MK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hard for kids to take picture. it was a waste of money.
