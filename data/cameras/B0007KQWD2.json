{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Largest LCD in a digicam, but no more optical viewfinder", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R19KNMDB5U7H34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My local camera store just got their first shipment of Casio's new Exilim EX-Z57 super-slim digital camera, and I eagerly hopped over to check it out.The EX-Z57 is a very slight upgrade (and one downgrade... read on) of the very popular EX-Z55 model.  The Z55 had a 2.5\" LCD screen that was considered \"huge\" just a year ago, but now that so many other digital cameras also sport a 2.5\" LCD, Casio decided to release a 2.7\" LCD model, hence the Z57.  Amazingly, the overall physical size hasn't changed, and the EX-Z55's industry-leading amazing battery life (over 300 even with flash on and LCD on full-time) has been retained, making the EX-Z57 another battery life champ.As far as I can tell -- and from what the sales clerk told me -- the internals of the EX-Z57 are identical to those of its immediate predecessor.  This means very good image quality from such a small camera.  Three important issues to keep in mind as you shop for this camera or a similarly ultracompact model:1. The tiny lens and tiny sensor necessarily limit the sharpness of the picture.  If you shoot at the maximum 5MP and print out at up to 5x7\", you probably won't be disappointed by the sharpness of the picture.  However, as you print larger pictures, you'll see the pictures tend to be softer and noisier than from larger cameras.  This is simply a result of the law of physics, and it's a trade-off between size and quality.2. The small camera also means a small, limited-power flash, so your indoor pictures when the ambient lighting is dim will not come out very satisfactory.  Again, this is entirely due to the small form factor.  If you want to use this camera to shoot a small group of friends at a dinner party, it's okay.  But you should know that as you near the flash range and go beyond, you'll get horrible-looking pictures.3. A camera this small makes it very hard to hold it steady.  Many people with tiny cameras like this complain about blurry pictures.  This is because as you press the shutter button, you'll move the camera ever so slightly.  With a larger camera body (e.g., a digital SLR), the much heavier camera body requires more effort to hold which has the side benefit of providing a counteracting force to the shutter-pushing force.  Hence, with a small camera like the EX-Z57, you must remember to hold the camera very steady as you press the shutter.Whereas the older EX-Z55 had an optical viewfinder, Casio opted to remove it in order to accommodate the enlarged LCD screen without changing the overall size of the camera.  Yes, the Z55's optical viewfinder was tiny and hard to use, but at least it was an option -- and looking through the optical viewfinder instead of at the screen actually helps steady your shots because you hold the camera close to your body (think the principle of leverage).  Also, when you are really low on battery, switching to optical viewfinder can squeeze out a few more shots.  For a camera purish like myself, it's a pity that the optical viewfinder is no more on the Z57, but for most casual photographers (the Exilim's target audience) this will likely be a non-issue, since they probably would never use the optical vewfinder to begin with.In summary, the Z57 provides an unbeatable small form factor yet a crowd-pleasing huge LCD screen, amazing battery life and very good image quality (for a camera this size).  You can also record movies (albeit only at a stuttering 15 frames per second) as well as sound.  It's very intuitive to use, and my friends who have the Z55 are all very happy with it (once I gave them the tip about holding the camera super-steady or on a tripod to avoid blurs).  While I don't have money to buy another digital camera at the moment, but if I had some extra spare dough, I would definitely buy this just for the HUGE 2.7\" LCD.  To a gadget freak like me, it's priceless to be able to impress my friends with something this cool.  :)", "Date": "April 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "lmira \"lmira15\"", "ReviewID": "RQTA66CS5WEZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I broke my 2 year old 3.2 megapixel digital camera about a month ago and have been researching buying a new one since.  I finally decided on the z57 and I couldn't be happier.  I knew I wanted a point and shoot digital and definitely wanted more than 3.2 megapixels.  I narrowed my search down to the Olympus Stylus 500, the Konica Minolta x60 (my old digicam was a Minolta and I loved it so that's why I was considering buying another one) and the Nikon Coolpix S1.  I only came across the Casio Exilim Z57 when I was reading reviews on [...] when they suggested this camera, based on the reviews I was reading.  I read the review about it first and the thing that really stuck out about this camera was how fast it was.  I then came here on amazon and read reviews and the one thing that caught my eye was that someone said it didn't have a 'trick' flash, which means there's almost no shutter lag.  My old camera had this which caused a lot of problems for people keeping their eyes open in my pictures.  Since I was so used to a tiny camera, I wanted to go see this camera in person.  I went in, saw it, held it and was amazed at how small it was!!!  The screen is huge and it's extremely fast. One thing that turned me away from the Olympus Stylus 500 was that the shot-to-shot review was extremely poor.  If I'm not mistaken, it said that if you used the flash, the shot-to-shot delay was almost 8 seconds.  I know that when I'm in a situation where I want to use the flash, chances are, I want to take a picture asap and 8 seconds is a lifetime, especially if you're waiting anxiously to take another pic.  I think they said on the review I read about the z57 that the shot-to-shot delay with the flash was something like 2.2 seconds.  What a world of difference! The best shot selections make it easy to decide which one you want to use.  I thought that after having a digicam without a protruding lens, I wouldn't like that this camera had one, but I can't even tell the difference.  I think this camera is a great value (less than $300!)  I've only had it for a few days and couldn't be happier.  The more I keep playing with it, the more and more I love it.  After doing all my research I think I made a great decision going with this camera.", "Date": "September 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Slimming down in style...and profile!", "Author": "S.

After now owning a Motorola Razor and a Game Boy Micro, it was time to choose a digital camera that could in small spaces just like the two mentioned above, it was time to look for a camera that would heed my calling.I went to the nearest Wal-Mart and I browsed around. I was searching for a camera that fit my budget. It had to have a big, yet decent LCD screen, battery life, great picture taking ability, and of course, compact size.And there it was. The CASIO EXILIM EX-Z57. I tinkered around with it and I found that it felt nice all around.The LCD screen was 2.7\". It was great to have because when your at a club taking pictures, you would want to have people see how it looked instead of squinting to check it out.The menus were easy to navigate and simple to understand.The size is decent. Since this is the first slim camera I've ever owned, it does well. It may not be as thin as a SONY's, but it works for me.I'm impressed on how there are different modes for your pictures by choosing the right size you need, and the quality. Good!The flash is great. I'd like to say that it does not have a \"trick flash.\" The flash bulb doesn't flicker or do strange things to make your smile or your eyes do weird impressions. It's a simple straight flash that gets things moving quickly.Thank goodness! I dislike trick flash.If you're looking for a camera that has great compact abilities, size, weight, and style, then this is your camera.

I took pictures of Queen's Day in Amsterdam where the weather was sunny and everyone was wearing bright orange clothes. The pictures were perfect.  Then, I tried taking pictures at night and they were horrible. I took pictures at daybreak and sunset using the so called amazing \"best shot\" setting. most of the pictures looked grainy and/or blurry.I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, but the fact of the matter is this camera takes absolutely horrible photos anytime other than in perfect light or indoors. Outdoor photos in general are bad unless in direct sunlight and limited contrast is needed. It seemed like such a cool camera because of the screen size, but as my vacations memories are not at all captured well, the camera is about to go back into the closet or Goodwill. I would recommend people who want to take pictures more frequently than from noon to 2 pm, primarily of people, buy something else.The screen size is great for showing off to people when you take a really great photo, but don't expect this to happen too often. A smaller screen that takes good pictures would make me a lot happier. I just came back from Prague, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, and I have few good pictures.I encourage you to read review on the other sites listed below as these Amazon posters must have posted the day they got their cameras. Mail comes during the day, when this camera actually does a good job. I suspect that if they were polled again, they would probably repeat my review.One more thing ... While the size makes the camera very cute to use, is also impacts photo quality. Pictures can come out blury due to camera's size... must focus on holding camera steady.HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Perfect point and Shoot", "Author": "Adam P.

Almost one cool feature on this camera is you can change the sounds from the normal beep to a frog ribbit, a cool spaceship sound, etc. One thing I do suggest any new purchasers of this camera do is to grab a screen protector. I went out and bought a Nintendo DS screen protector and it works fine. A Nintendo DS has a 3\" screen as to this camera has a 2.7\" screen so a few inches different. You can trim off the excess inches if you want to make it fit nicely. But it'll help keep the screen clean of finger smudges and protect it from scratches. The screen is so big I'm afraid your fingernails might scratch it. Anyways overall this camera takes excellent quality photos and easy to use.

Dutta", "ReviewID": "R152SBNIQNLE5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace my old and bulky Dimage S414. The dimage used to take a few snaps on a single charge. This camera has a marathon battery life. I used it for my whole graduation ceremony, and coupled with a 1GB card, it served as a great digital video camera too. The profile is slim with an excellent form factor. This does not compromise on the image quality however as it does not use the new type lenses like the Canon T33, T1. (The technology is beta).Finally, the LCD truly makes the viewfinder obsolete.A camera from Casio thats better than anything from anybrand short of a digital SLR.", "Date": "May 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera, loaded with features", "Author": "leogrrl", "ReviewID": "R10HPPFKJI0C9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite reading positive reviews, I initially hesitated before buying this little camera -- I wasn't sure how a Casio would stack up against brands like Canon and Nikon. But a local shop strongly recommended this model, and I decided to give it a try. I'm glad to say that I've been very pleasantly surprised by the EX-Z57's excellent performance and features.The reason I was buying a new digital P&S; in the first place was that my old Nikon Coolpix (a 775) was really, really slow; I missed way too many perfect moments or expressions waiting for that thing to actually take a picture. (In all other respects, I love the Nikon.) My other camera -- a Canon Digital Rebel -- is absolutely awesome, but it's too big and heavy to take with you without a definite reason. For day-to-day shooting around town, I wanted something we could toss into a pocket or bag. (The best way to take good photos is to actually have a camera with you when the opportunity comes up!!!)So I was looking for a fast, small, high-quality camera. The Casio is fast -- very fast -- when starting up, shooting, and displaying images or menus. The size is perfect. And the quality of the images and performance has been very high.While researching the Casio, I wondered about the lack of a viewfinder. Again, I've been pleased. The huge LCD is entirely sufficient for shooting pictures -- I haven't missed the viewfinder at all -- and it's great to have such a large screen to work with when you're scrolling through the various features. For example, if you want to check out the \"best shot\" pre-set modes, you can scroll through screens that have a title, a sample photo, and a one-sentence description of the settings/purpose. It's a lot of useful information that you simply can't display on cameras with standard screens.The menu and controls are inuitive and easy to learn. The manual provides next to no information, but once you know what the features are -- the Casio site describes them in detail -- it's easy to become proficient.The image quality has been great -- even for indoor photos. The \"docking station\" is cool, too -- you can simultaneously charge the battery and transfer images.So while we've only had this for a few weeks, we've already taken a few hundred photos, and we're really pleased with this little camera. It's loaded with features, easy to use, and seemingly very well made. With the 5 megapixel capacity, I think it's a great buy, especially compared to comparable big-name brands.", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Ellen Collins", "ReviewID": "R2R5GHX0MMNTBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera--highy intuitive and how about the great LED screen---love the big size.The only snag I hit with this purchase was with the Casio tech support---the guy didn't have a clue how to fix my problem which turned out to really simple.  I'll preface this by saying that I'm new to digital cameras.  I'm also a recent convert to the Mac platform.  The reason I called tech support was because I was unable to install the Picture Loader software that comes with Exilim.  I later found out by talking to my geek friend that if you have Mac Os X then you need to install Classic 9 in order to install Picture Loader.  Classic is found on an install disc that comes with your computer entitled Additional Applications.", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Casio rip-off", "Author": "Test Engineer \"Test Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R22ZXUDDLG64S7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My camera went bad from a VERY COMMONLY reported manufacturing defect \"camera stabilizer is not available\" error message in the model I had.
