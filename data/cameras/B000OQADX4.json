I had a Kodak before, but my use finally took a tole on it-so I had to get a new camera.  I have had nothing but good experiances with Kodak, this camera is no exception.+ It is easy to learn how to use.+ The screen is great size+ Small enough to fit in your pocket.+ Takes wonderful pictures. The blurry alert is really helpful-there are 3 color modes-green, yellow, and red-so you know what you can expect when you take the picture.+ The color is wonderful.+ You can choose your sounds that you want heard-shutter, focus, startup, etc.+ The video mode is really great-you can make a picture from a movie right on the camera.+ Also the panoramic stitching is incredible-does it right on the camera so you can see if it turned out.- If you are new to Kodak-the manual is not in-depth-maybe harder to learn.- No viewfinder. I haven't used it in bright sun, so I don't know how the screen will show.- The microphone is on the bottom right (looking at it from the front) and that is where I tend to put my fingers when I want it to be steady-Then the sound isn't recorded-they should have put that on the other side of the lens.  You just have to remember that when you do a video.Again, this camera is fantastic, and for the price you really can't beat it! Kodak did a really great job on this one!", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "desiwatt \"desiwatt\"", "ReviewID": "R3JYMB8A3IVSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace a Kodak V603 that I used for a while thinking that the \"V803\" indicated a camera with more functions, a \"new and improved\" version of the V603 that I had been using.  The only incremental feature that the V803 offers is a higher 8 Mega Pixel resolution versus the maximum 6 Mega Pixel resolution of the V603.  Actually the V803 excludes many functions such as Auto Rotate that are present in the V603.  But the V803 does take very satisfactory pictures.  If you put the camera in the \"fully automatic\" mode and simply click away you will get pretty decent pictures.  Point and Click is what describes most of my picture taking so I am satisfied with the camera's performance.  I would recommend this camera if you anticipate doing mostly Point and Click type of shooting with an expectation of decent (but not fantastic) results.  By the way, I would also recommend that you totally skip installing any of the software that comes with the camera as the software is essentially Junk Ware that installs all sorts of unneccesary software and background processes whose main function ends up being to simply slow down your computer.  Instead get an inexpensive SD Card reader and use that to read your memory card like a Disk Drive and simply copy and paste your pictures from the Memory Card to your hard disk.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "An Overlooked Wonder", "Author": "Missy", "ReviewID": "RT734Z2BX2HXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most people, I used to believe that the more money you had to spend for an electronic item the better it was, I'm starting to believe this theory is false and this camera proves it. This camera is only $199.99, and it's wonderful. It's up to 8MP, and it has like a gazillion scene selections(I just keep it in AUTO). I also like the fact that it has a re-chargeable battery, and yes it comes with the charger. I haven't used the video option yet, so I can't comment on that yet. If you're looking for a camera takes beautiful pictures, comes in a beautiful color (yes I have the purple one, but you have a choice of eight different ones), and it's inexpensive, then BUY THIS CAMERA! You won't be disappointed.If you're having a hard time finding this camera in the store, I suggest you buy it from the Kodak Online Store. I've actually had this camera since the beginning of March.

It is comfortable to carry, easy to use, and takes very good photos. I especially like the ability to overide the automatic settings and get a little creative with this camera. It has a high ISO, which allows you to take existing light photos, even at night. I recommend this camera, especially for under $200, it is a real deal. Negatives? A bit bigger screen, and perhaps a bit better optics. (The optics aren't bad, just not great, but this is typical of sub $300 aim and shoot cameras.) Overall, I am very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "SIX STARS!!! A fantastic camera at a great price", "Author": "Andrew J. Riemer \"Andrew James Riemer\"", "ReviewID": "R2M2AYYS36R10Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[UPDATE: After many months, the camera could no longer focus automatically (the lens would extend and retract, but it was in focus only at one spot along the way), but the good news is that Kodak service was fantastic. Wait time was short, the person on the other end made sure she understood the problem, and then provided a lot of information regarding the RMA process.  The only drawbacks were that I had to pay shipping costs to send the camera in, and that it took a little over a week (in total) before the camera came back as good as new.  No problems since then.  If I find this one at the right price again, I will buy another (so my wife and I will each have one). Could this have been the problem others reported regarding \"blurry photos\"? I don't know, but their service department took care of it right away.]I picked this up on a discount site because the price was right (around $100).  This camera has exceeded expectations in every way.  I would gladly have paid up to around $200 for this little marvel.  A number of other reviews list a lot of specific details.  Let me address the things that impressed me about this camera, and then address the points from some other negative reviews:THE GREAT STUFF---------------- Even without reading the manual, most functions were a snap to learn.- There are far more functions available than I am likely to ever use (e.g., the panoramic photo option, the burst feature).  There are many advanced configuration options.- The recycle time (the time it takes for the camera to be ready for the next shot) is shorter than for any of the other digital cameras I have owned.- Color registration is great, and the flash does not wash out the photo as much as it had on the Vivitar cameras I owned.-  The rechargable battery is a feature that should be standard on every digital camera. This one will save you tons of dollars on battery costs over the life of the camera.  So far, we've yet to completely drain the battery in a single day of shooting.THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE! Buy it as a \"point and shoot\" camera for your snapshots and you'll be getting a camera that will let you grow into a new hobby.  If you're looking for a digital camera that has some great features at a great price, you won't go wrong with this one!  BE SURE TO PICK UP AN SD CARD--at the time of this writing, a 1 Gb card sells for under $20 and will hold around 290 photos at maximum (8.0 megapixel) resolution.SOME NOTES ABOUT OTHERS' NEGATIVE POINTS (WHY I DISAGREE):----------------------------------------------------------NO VIEWFINDER - I honestly thought this one would bug me, but it has not been a problem at all.  The camera's default view provides a cross-frame in which to center the subject of your photo.  Toggling the joystick left and right adjusts the brightness of the LCD display, allowing it to compensate for most light conditionss.BLURRY PHOTOS [be sure to review the UPDATE section at the top of this review]- Neither my wife or I have had any real problem with blurry photos.  When you start to depress the shutter button, the camera starts to focus.  When focus is achieved, the camera boxes those areas that are in focus in green boxes.  This was really helpful when I was trying to make sure something was in focus (like a face rather than a pendant).  When we've allowed for the camera to finish its autofocus routine, all of our photos have come out well.THE BUTTONS - Some complained that the buttons were too flat against the body, makin them hard to depress.  I did not find this to be a problem at all (and I have big fingers).  To the contrary, I found the low-profile buttons to be a boon because it prevented me from accidentally depressing them.JOYSTICK NAVIGATION - Contrary to a number of reviewers, I had no problem with the mini joystick that is used for navigation.  It is very comfortable to control it with my right thumb while holding the camera, and I did not have any problem getting it to accept a direct inward press (it did not angle off in any direction).  I wonder if others' control of the joystick improved with use.  I found this navigation tool much better than the button-only navigation on my previous cameras.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "High quality, small, user-friendly camera -- well-worth the price!", "Author": "K. Traester", "ReviewID": "R1R6X7ZDOYJ4TS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A previous owner for two Kodak EasyShare cameras, this V803 far surpasses both of them. It is extremely easy to use and takes crystal clear photos with the touch of a button. It can also easily fit in your pocket and go everywhere or anywhere with you!I highly recommend this camera for both casual and more experienced photographers who desire the clearest, most 8.0 MP vivid photos with no complications. Do not waste your money on a more expensive version -- the V803 will suit your all-around photography needs with sophistication, reliability, and simplicity.Side note: I would definitely recommend purchasing some sort of case for this camera, as it can easily get scratched (especially if you frequently use it, as I do). Securing its future with a one or two year warrantee is also highly advised, but with good care, this camera should last you at least a few good years of high usage.", "Date": "August 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Weighs 3.5 ounces!", "Author": "Cristin", "ReviewID": "R29Z774XTLSBKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic camera.

Overall, I wish I would have kept my old camera. This one sometimes gets stuck on whatever I was doing and sometimes the lens won't retract and I can't even turn the power off. So then I have to take out the battery, put it back in and then press the on/off button to turn it back on. Also, the video mode really sucks compared to my V550. My old camera's video mode showed clearly in any lighting. With this camera, it looks fuzzy in dimmer lighting. Also while you're shooting a video you can hear a clicking sound which shows up on the video, but I figured out a way around it. It is the sound of the lens continuously auto focusing. If you set it to single auto focus you won't hear that sound anymore. But what I do LOVE about this camera are the crisp sharp pictures I get every time. I guess it's worth the money because Kodak added a lot of other features that are good. Panoramic mode, on-camera video editing and more things that I really like. I guess I'm happy with this camera, but I wish Kodak would fix whatever software glitches they obviously have.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Two Strikes, You're out!", "Author": "D.

This Kodak model has an image stablization feature that let's me take pictures that are in focus about 99 percent of the time. We just returned from a vacation to Sedona and took almost 400 pictures and only two were out of focus. The clarity of the photos and the ease of use makes this a great little camera.

I didn't do any research before buying this one like I did on previous cameras and yet I really love this little camera. It's small enough to carry in my purse without feeling like I have a brick in my purse. It's easy to change picture size from 1.2 mp up to 8 mp (7 choices). In fact, all menu choices are easy to select and the whole camera is nicely laid out. Nice sized lcd screen on back, and lens neatly folds up and covers lens when power is turned off. Transferring pictures is just as easy, hardest thing was finding out where they hid the slot to plug the cord into. Only thing I had trouble with is that you have to push and hold the power button till it turns on, not just push and its on. I guess it saves batteries by not turning on easily but it took some getting use to. And I love the picture quality.

The camera retailed for $199 and was 8MP which I was excited about.  I also liked how small it was, that it used my old SD card and had a rechargable battery.

I had bought it at Target and they exchanged it for another straight up.  About 4 months later I had the camera in a cargo pocket and when I reached in to get it I found the screen cracked again.

Vislocky \"Jamie\"", "ReviewID": "R205YBRU1CHG4Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I initially bought this camera in the pink color for my mother, someone who is totally non tech savvy.  I asked her what kind of camera she was interested in and she said \"a pink one\".  At that time, this camera was brand new and I had bought myself the more expensive V603 (which I don't believe is made anymore) and was incredibly pleased with it.  I assumed that this camera was a similar model so I got it for her.Like most of the other kodak digitals I've worked with, the interface on this camera is extremeley user friendly.  It does come in a wide variety of colors which is nice when you want it to match your personality.  The screen is big and clear and the controls are easy to use.However, when we got it out of the box and started playing with it, we realized that it was inferior to the v603.  One of the best things about my camera is the button to shutter speed.  This camera had a small delay like so many other digital cameras.  Also, the photos weren't very clear.  Once we started printing them up we realized that the detail, even at the highest resolution, was blurry or fuzzy.  Also, there were some serious flash problems.  I don't know if the one we got was a defective model or if it was an issue in more of these cameras, but after taking a flash photo it was a good minute or two before the flash would work again.  Not what I would expect from Kodak.My suggestion is don't buy this camera.  The price has come down, yes, but it could make for an embarressing gift if the recipient has the same issues my mom.  If you are looking for a pink camera I highly reccommend the Casio Exilm (which is what we ended up getting for mom after I returned this one to the store.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "This camera is TOO DELICATE", "Author": "Gift Card Recipient \"Digital Camera LOVER\"", "ReviewID": "R222WFI1W868B7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the V1003.

I've only had  it for 2 years and it's broken three times, the same problem each times. The camera has frozen on me many times, which causes me to have to take out the battery and put it back in. To me, it takes too long to turn on and the shutter lag is pretty long, which causes me to miss some shots I would have liked to get. The video isn't too great as well because if it's windy outside, it picks up the wind and it blocks out the sounds. As well with parties with loud music, it sounds VERY static-y and you cant hear anything. I've gone through that many times and I miss hearing things while watching video. The video is probably the worst on this camera.The camera does not do well in low-light settings, the pictures mostly come out very dark. Although it takes nice pictures outdoors. Also, when you would zoom in for a picture, the picture would become very blurry.On the plus side, this camera is a very easy to use and easy to take anywhere. What I liked was that if you accidentally deleted a picture you could get it back right after, and also the Favorites button. The pictures are OK, but not great. Although, I would  not recommend this camera.I am actually buying a new camera next week, I am getting the Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS. I went to Best Buy and played around with it and I was very impressed, it's a wonderful camera that takes unbelieveable CLEAR, CRISP pictures. And it's also a more sturdy camera than the Kodak V803.So overall, to me, the Kodak V803 is not worth $200. You can get a way better camera for a way better price.
