Simple, easy camera that was able to capture beautiful shots. It's lightweight and is perfect for fast shooting and anything on-the-go. I recommend this to anyone who wants a small portable camera that takes great shots!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Charge the whole camera", "Author": "L. Garrett", "ReviewID": "R313I8C38EBDPB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When the battery runs down you have to charge the whole camera, not just a battery!!! You can't just put new batteries in or replace the battery...you have to plug in the whole camera. When it's plugged in, you can't take photos, until it gets charged. In my old camera, if my battery was running low, I could replace the battery with plain old alkaline AA batteries, or a freshly charged rechargable or a new battery. Not this one. Bad bad bad. Also...when the battery goes dead, the camera stops in whatever position it is in...the lens exposed or however it happens to be at that moment.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "decent for price", "Author": "tiffany8", "ReviewID": "R2SW8LVJHG5S7I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera itself was in good shape. Didn't have a power cord for charging or a memory card with it. I know that the memory card wasn't advertised as included, but for the same price i could have gone to my local walmart and gotten the camera with a memory card included.  I was mostly disappointed that there was no outlet charger for the phone. We had to go to radioshack to buy one, extra cost and time. But like I said, the camera was in very good shape", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003EWVZY6"}}
