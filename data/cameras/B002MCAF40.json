The pictures were very good if you or your subject did not move too much.  No water got in the camera case.  Pictures of objects in the distance were distorted on the ends due to the camera case.  I purchased this camera and a digital camera maskLiquid Image Exploer Series 3.1MP Underwater Mask - Digital Camera that cost $150.  This camera took pictures almost as good as the $150 model.  We used it for 2 weeks without troubles.  Take lots of photos, or use the video for a minute or less.  Larger video files can slow down computers during playback.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Intova Snap Sights Cam (SS-1000)", "Author": "William Sante \"W. Sante\"", "ReviewID": "RTIDT3MIRKWZM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I found this camera to be a huge nuisance to use.  Both photographer and subject must remain perfectly still or picture will be blurry..no forgiveness there.  Unfortunately, this is always difficult with any water sport or activity.  Also, the shutter button is very difficult to push (as are all of the buttons) and the overall size of the camera is very small, both adding to the difficulty of holding the camera still when taking pictures.  Abundant light is required or, again, your pictures will come out blurry.  Many of my photos were distorted, too.  For example, my fishing pole in some pictures was wavy, likely caused by glare off the plastic case and, more so, distortion caused by light shining though the multiple (6) raised dots on the case (I suspect these are a novelty added to the case design to resemble water drops).  The viewfinder is only about an inch square, so it is essentially impossible to use other than to get a general idea where your subject is located, especially for videos.  It is difficult to see if the camera was still recording or not.  Daylight makes it that much harder to see anything in it.  Finally, it would frequently shut off.  Not sure if this is a power saving function, but it became very irritating during use.  I will cut my loses on this camera and buy something else. The only pluses I found with the product were the case remained water tight during use and USB download of the pics and videos is straight forward.  Oh, there was no memory card included...the packaging states a memory card up to 2MB can be used.  I purchased one seperately.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Underwater loveliness!", "Author": "aimee wright", "ReviewID": "R122HWBNHRTE8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

It works quite well and takes relatively good pictures for what it is and what it costs, but does suffer from a number of drawbacks.  Firstly, the internal storage is enough for about 30 pictures, which is not unexpected, but it only accommodates micro-SD cards.  Not a problem, right, until you consider that it can only handle ones of a 2GB size and smaller.  That's number two, most stores do not carry those sizes any longer because of demand so do not get caught on vacation without adequate cards.  The upside is that the pictures, in my experience, take only about 200KB of storage, meaning you can get a tad under 1,000 pictures on a card assuming no video.  Finally, with the explosion in technology and dropping prices, there is little need to get this type of starter camera unless you are getting it for an adolescent.I upgraded this to the Fuji XJ50, still a starter in my opinion, a year or so ago for better HD video and pictures and am incredibly pleased.
