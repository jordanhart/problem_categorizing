Also, as the sun moves, the shadows cast by tall trees on the driveway trips the alarm.  So on a intermittent cloudy day the two transmitters that I have are tripped almost continuously all day long.  OptexAmerica says they are aware of the problem but have no solution.  To be clear, it is not the sun hitting the transmitters, it is the general sunlight changing on the driveway surface.  This system might work well indoors, but not anywhere that's sunny!  Hard to believe, I agree!  Works well at night.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little device for home security", "Author": "TEd \"True Review\"", "ReviewID": "R3MQQG78H5VRMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "put it by your driveway, back doors, near your car in the driveway and it will wake you up in the night to let you know something is moving around nearby.
