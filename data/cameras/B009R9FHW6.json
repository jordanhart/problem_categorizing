Basically, you pay the same for the bundle as other place charge for the camera alone. 5 stars because all this stuff is essentially free, BUT the filters vignette at the widest zoom setting. The edge is too thick and you can actually see it in the extreme corners, so the UV filter is useless for protection. The only useful one is the polarizer, just not at the widest zoom setting. I would still buy this bundle even with the cheap filters.Shame on you Sony for not including a regular charger! Had to buy an external one for 10 bucks.If I was to review the camera itself it would be 3-4 stars only. For a 1000 dollars it's a bit disappointing. * First the charger, or the lack of it. You have to plug in the whole camera for charging.* The lens is softer on the right side. BAD QC.* The lens feels and sounds cheap. It's also wobbly. It's $350 or so stand alone, and I'm not sure it's worth it. Ok, it small and collapsible, but it feels worse than Canon 50mm 1.8. Sounds about the same.* The body is fine, great sensor, viewfinder (big plus), built-in flash which can be turned upwards for bouncing, but it's SLOW. Startup time is long, shot-to-shot is slow out of the box, AF is inaccurate. I had many misfocused shots. I come from 7D, so I might be spoiled, but come on, this one is 1000 bucks! I expect more for this price.* OK, the last gripe is that auto ISO doesn't work in M mode. It does in A99 I hear. This is the most useful in-door combination for me. I use it all the time on my 7D.Still 5 stars because the bundle is a killer! If you want NEX-6, get this bundle!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!!!", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R257KNSMZ31EH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having searched for weeks and sifting through all the DSLR options out there, I am so happy to have made this choice.  This camera embodies everything a larger, bulkier DSLR offers in a compact, comfortable housing.  The menus are easy to navigate and memorize and the photo quality is supreme.  The Nex 6 is a better option than the Nex 5 if you are looking for a DSLR substitute.  The ability to make selections on the dials is vital without having to use the touchscreen.  Thought I would miss the touchscreen but I do not at all.The case that comes with this STINKS and there should be a remote battery charger included. Other than that this camera is everything I hoped it would be and more.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "kit lens is not good quality", "Author": "Hikmat amin", "ReviewID": "R34GTDK9ZSP2XU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The kit lens isn't impressive. You would think with that price range, the kit lens should perform better, but it doesn't and that bugs meUPDATE: 11/30/2013After using the camera for a couple of months, I want to say that I am so far happy from its performance, especially for low light situations. I got to practice a bit with the kit lens and it seems to be taking decent quality pictures.So far, happy now", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very cool", "Author": "Ninjei", "ReviewID": "R2HCB4UW7PHUW6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is so nice looking and lightweight. The pictures are definitely comparable to an SLR. You have to know what you're doing though. I found I kept more pics on auto mode from my Nikon d60 with kit lens than with the Nex 6. For now anyway, as I haven't had it too long. The low light performance is phenomenal! I hear it only gets better with faster lenses. If you know all your settings and how to properly use the camera I think you can get some amazing results from this camera. Either way, for me, for its looks and light weight, I would definitely pick this over any full sized SLR or even the Canon SL1. The canon is small, but compared to the Nex, is still a bit of a behemoth. On the negative side, the kits lens definitely distorts at the widest angle. I didn't notice until I started reviewing my pictures and the people on the edges were coming out with cone heads. You just have to increase the focal length to 18mm and its not really a problem.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unless you're a REAL PRO, this is a no-brainer.", "Author": "Josh H.", "ReviewID": "R2OSROR83GW62J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This seller is offering the whole bundle you see here for what some other vendors are charging for the camera alone.  I bought this about a month ago and am kicking myself for not buying it earlier.  I've had a lot of success over the past 5-7 years taking incredible shots with just a point and shoot Canon PowerShot.  I became pretty good at Lightroom and viewers of my galleries are pretty shocked that most of the \"wow\" shots I have were taken with no tripod while backpacking in europe, brazil, all over the Caribbean, and all over the lower-48 (mainly southwest, my fave) and Alaska.  I've used my sister's Canon xsi before and, although it's a more bulky and professional camera, what really got me going was shooting in RAW.  *NOW* i get how professionals get those unbelievable shots.  All they need to do is get the exposure anywhere in the ballpark, with a proper shutter, and they can touch up the HECK out of the picture in Lightroom or Photoshop with the huge color space captured by the RAW format.So, now, the NEX-6 is my secret weapon.  I can bring this little baby anywhere i hike and get better shots than all the goofballs lugging around giant camera bodies with tripods and all sorts of filters and gadgets.  Give me a break.  Unless i made my living from photography there's really no need for anything larger or more expensive than the NEX-6.  All you gear freaks make me laugh!  I can climb trees with this camera, scale a gorge so i can get up close to a waterfall or better frame of a tree or bird.  I can jam HDR shots with amazing clarity just by leaning the little camera up against a tree, while all you guys are pulling out your tripods and jockeying for position with each other as a cloud comes and ruins the shot or your scare the wildlife away.  I love it !By the way .. HDR with this little guy is great.  You only get 3 shots, but you can go up to + or - 3 stops on the exposure.. some higher end models will go up to 5, and also take a picture at every 1 stop between -5 and 5.  I don't really see much benefit in this unless you are in a TRULY wacky lighting scenario.  I usually do +/- 2 stops, then bring the RAWs into Lightroom and Photomatix.  Awesome combo and you can either use HDR to simply achieve highlight PLUS shadow clarity, OR you can use it to get that \"painting\" effect.  Either way, the NEX6 has you covered.So far i have the 16mm wide angle lens plus the attachment ultra-wide angle lens.. awesome shots with this little setup.  I am going to get the fisheye lens soon.  Unless SONY comes out with an e-mount telephoto beyond 200mm, i'll probably explore using an adapter with a Canon, Sigma, or other non-sony lens.  I know you lose auto-focus, but when you bust out a 300mm ++ lens, I normally manually focus the shot anyways as you are likely to be on a tripod or leaning on a tree or something.Anyways, this camera is AWESOME, don't think twice.

It was much more lightweight than my Nikon, so I swapped cameras with him when I went on a 3 week trek to Nepal and I was delighted with it as well.

The color is perfect and the focus system works well. Moreover, the EVF is very useful on the sunny days. The heavy sunshine sometimes makes the LCD too dim.For me the acceptable ISO level is 3200, which is much better than the 350D. The wifi and app are also helpful. The most important, it is easy to carry. The DSLR is either too heavy or too large.It seems the camera has been used before for it is not sealed with the factory sticker (may be for a test or something like that, there is no sign of using on the camera), there is some bits of wood in the package of the original battery which should not be found in a factory sealed package. Also, the counting of the photo is not from 1, but from a number about 150. The original battery seemed to be activated long ago and the voltage is too low to power on the camera since the long time of preserving. Thus, next time when you sell your camera, please help charge the battery if it has been activated before, thank you~ I charged the batter for more than 6 hours to get it back to normal.Above all, it is a great bundle.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "JAS", "ReviewID": "R2P534HMPXEXGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!
