I am so happy I purchased this Sony cyber-shot camera instead!! It exceeded all my expectations and then some. The picture quality is exceptional, it shoots great videos, and has an easy mode to make usage a breeze. There are so many functions.  Overall this is an exceptional point and shoot. My only pet peve is th battery life is really short. Even with that defect I still give it a 5/5.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera.

Only had it a few hours, so not a lot of detail to add except that it seems to perform really, really well. take the time to run through its various features and options and you'll be glad you did. By the way, I've seen some comments on Q&A; sites wondering about how to find a replacement for the micro USB cable that comes with the camera. Its not a \"normal\" size, but I just found that it seems to be the same size as the micro USB cable for the Kindle! No problem finding those around. Problem solved! :-)", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "p. oberlander is gay!!!", "Author": "Greg droddy", "ReviewID": "R3CCH03FS0P2ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!!

It works perfectly well. the images are 10 times better quality than my other cameras. It has many features that are useful. sometimes using this camera, i feel like i have a DSLR already. Love the way it has the blur out function and many more. The only downside is that I lost my cable that connects the camera to the Comp or the charger. So My camera has been dead for months. I cannot charge my battery whatsoever. For this type of camera, you cannot find another USB cord that fits if you loose it. So i'm stuck having to buy another whole battery kit that's going to cost over $50. boooo", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "fabiana", "ReviewID": "R1P47PLVE8PYS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera was very good.

I have had a few digital cameras before and this has been my least favorite. Contrary to other people's reviews, I don't find it easy to use. I am not very camera savvy so that could greatly be my problem, but I find my pictures are always blurry. The 18.2 megapixels doesn't seem to be any significant improvement on my 12 and 14 megapixel cameras from before, so don't be drawn in to this camera just for that aspect. I've only had it a year but I am trying to get rid of it for something much more user friendly.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is great!", "Author": "Arianna", "ReviewID": "RGVIYPCZM2IWX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is just as I expected and meets all expectations as the descriptions provide.

Takes really great video as well...but hey it's a Sony so you kinda expect that.  I love the panoramic pics it takes as well.Can't get much better on a camera that fits in your pocket in my opinion!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returning it tomorrow", "Author": "Sari berry", "ReviewID": "R3IUTBFBXTDFOF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been a life long Canon user, but thought I would change it up this time.  My 6 year old Canon takes so long to load that I miss shots of my 2 year old.  I thought this would be a great camera after reading the reviews.  All of our shots came out blurry.  My husband switched it to easy mode, but then everything seemed white washed and slightly distorted.  While I could take the photos quickly (which is what I need), they always came out blurry, no matter how still my husband and son are (and it's not easy to get a 2 year old to hold still).  The menu system is also complicated and I was really unimpressed by the \"fun\" features.  They all just seemed to blur the photos even more, and there are only 4 colors you can choose from for the color accent.  I purchased this a week ago and we have been trying it out, but it's going back tomorrow.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony disappoints again", "Author": "P. Oberlander", "ReviewID": "R3IXX8JDIWKWGW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had so many problems with Sony electronics in the past that I swore them off in 2005.  Radios(1 year), CD players(3 years), high-end CRT graphic monitor(3.1 years), a CRT television(4 years) that go out shortly after warranty expires.  I finally gave in after 7 years and bought this camera.  It does everything it is supposed to pretty well and the specs are great.However, as with past Sony products, it has a problem.  The display on the back is, evidently, not very tough.  I have had multiple point and shoot cameras.  I buy a new one every 2 years (Canon, Olympic, Nikon and Pentax) since 2000 to get the highest resolution.  My wife also does.  I have always put them in my pocket and never had a display break.  This happened with the Sony.
