I chose the Panasonic FX50 over the Canon SD800 as it has very similar features including optical image stabilization and 28mm wide angle.  The Canon just seemed tired - in its styling and menus and I read some questionable reviews about its lens.  As for the Panasonic, I love the super bright 3\" screen.  The styling is beautiful, especially in the black...and of course there is that Leica lens.  I was particually concerned about the lag time between pushing the button and the shutter click as I am chasing around my 9 month old.  This camera is quick and even has a \"baby\" scene set.  The toggle control makes scrolling through the menus a breeze, and these menus are very intuitive.  The body construction seems pretty solid.  I have yet to assess battery life and video quality, and I would like to take some more time to compare the image quality of differnt shots, but so far I am impressed.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very dissapointed", "Author": "M. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R5ENIZMIIJZU4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix DMC FX50 is the latest upgrade to the quite successful FX07, with the addition of a big, beautiful 3 inch screen. The menu functions are well laid out and easy to use, and the camera feels comfortable to hold and fits easily in the pocket. The Image Stabilisation (OIS) works very well even at long focal lengths, and is great for quick \"one handed\" snaps when on the move.Recording video works quite well, however zooming is NOT available as mentioned previously and sound quality is quite poor, to the point of being unable to pick up audible conversation from anyone but yourself.  And now..on the subject of poor.Where this camera fails miserably is picture quality. Panasonic I believe have made a big mistake with this lens, as at its widest angle (and default start-up focal length), barrel distortion is quite noticeable with horrible blurring at the edges.  This is most disappointing, considering it is quite sharp towards the centre of the image.  Initially I thought I'd been sold a lemon, but after browsing hundreds of photos from other FX50 owners on Flickr I, it is just as noticeable, especially when the images are viewed at larger size.Indoor photography is equally horrible as the FX50 struggles to auto-focus in even the most gracious indoor lighting conditions.  Flash performance is not too bad considering the small size of the flash window, but flash-less photography using high ISO is also very poor, even when using a tripod.In summary, I am very disappointed with this camera and would not recommend it to anyone wishing to take good quality pictures at sizes larger than 1024 X 765, and especially significant indoor shots.Such a pity though, that big beautiful bright screen is a wonder to look at.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent photos, Some lame features", "Author": "Intelligentsia \"Intelligentsia\"", "ReviewID": "R18SJF1JI8D3EG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes great photos. The menus are generally well designed. The minimalistic controls make it straightforward and not complicated.A major missing feature is the abiltiy to display the date on the photo. (Needed for insurance and legal purposes to document the date of the photo.) While Panasonic includes a proprietary program that can print the date, you can ONLY get the date through this program, not by uploading the photos to other printing services or by using other software.The auto-rotate feature in the camera is lame: The photo isn't rotated to the correct orientation in the JPG file, a note is simply put into the file indicating the rotation (landscape/portrait). Other brands will actually store the file with the correct orientation. So, when you view photos in Windows Explorer they are sideways and upside down when they could have all been correct.For videos and rapid photos you REALLY need an ULTRA high-speed SD card...not the low-cost variety.The camera is thicker than other slim models, and you definitely feel this thickness if you intend to pocket it. A shame, since 1/8\" or 1/4\" would make all the difference between being a bulge or not.Separate charger is nice, but you also will want an extra battery since you must remove the battery from the camera in order to sharge it. The charger is small and compact and good for travel since it doesn't have a big cord. (Overall it was a good choice for a separate charger, but it's not the norm with some brands.)Some features are cryptically named, such as \"Mode 1\" and \"Mode 2\" for the anti-shake. A more descriptive name would make it easier to understand the subtle difference between them.Overall, a good camera that takes excellent quality pictures.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Truly Great Camera", "Author": "Stone", "ReviewID": "RBVSYRNRWWKN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very well-designed camera that takes great pictures.  It is packed with features that are easy to access thanks to an intuitive menu.  The lens allows a wider angle than many others (equivalent to a 28mm. on an SLR), and is indispensible for both indoor and landscape shots.  Picture quality is excellent.  Battery life is excellent.  Best of all, the 3-inch display is just stunning.  The large display makes it easy to frame up shots, and be prepared to hear gasps from people when you play back your images.  I love the small, portable charger, and also really like the connector that allows you to hook up your camera to any TV and start an instant slide show.As for dislikes, the software for transferring images to a PC is not very well designed, although it is functional.  I prefer to use the software that came with an old Olympus camera that I have.  Also, the flash for the camera is a bit too powerful for close shots, and I have not found a menu setting that allows it to be adjusted.  These are minor points however, and I am confident in recommending this as a great camera at a great price.", "Date": "January 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Small Package with Everything", "Author": "George Johnston", "ReviewID": "R31RKTJHNOI2VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera after reading a review in Popular Photography about shirt pocket cameras.  This is one of he best purchases I've made.  The camera delivered everything promised and is simple enough my wife, who is a Luddite in her best moments, enjoys taking shots with it.  I use it for taking a lot of pictures of mechanical equipment (macro and regular shots) in the field in some difficult lighting scenarios.  The camera has performed wonderfully in every situation and the large CD makes framing shots second nature.  The nicest non-SLR camera I've ever owned.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "good review for me", "Author": "beta1097 \"beta1097\"", "ReviewID": "RU3QMU46TSTY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace an archaic Toshiba, and have a good digital camera for a honeymoon in Costa Rica.  I also bought two half gig high speed SD cards (already had a 1 gig MMC), an extra battery and the case from Panasonic.The battery amazed me the most, coming from the Toshiba which would eat four double A's in 10 pictures with the flash.  The battery would last nearly as long as the SD card (200+ photos at 5M), without the flash, and could easily do more than half of the card with the flash.  It was nice though to have a small charger and the spare battery.The high speed SD is a huge benefit.  The writing was nearly instant, as opposed to the MMC card, which had a noticeable write time following a photo.The pictures ranged from very crisp and clean to not so great.  A lot of it was me figuring out the best settings.  The pre-fixed scenery feature for specific conditions was nice too, took some of the guess work out of the manual settings for me.  The camera did very well from a foot to about 20 feet.  Beyond that, I ran into trouble taking detail shots at a distance.  And I didn't care at all for the digital zoom.  Those shots almost always were blurry.  The 16:9 setting did a great job doing the scenery shots.Overall, I am very pleased with the ease of use and quality of the camera.  I am sure you can find cameras that take better pictures, but not in such a nice, small and easy to use package.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "R.E.

This does all three and more very well. I take about 50-70 photos a day, and the battery still has at least 3/4 charge at the end of the day. Menu is easy to navigate and intuitive. The camera is a little bigger than a business card and about 1\" thick. It turns on and is ready to snap a shot very quickly.

I have used it constantly since.  It is the perfect camera for one like me - impatient, visually impaired and critically demanding.  I purchased the camera for the display after seeing someone using one like it but smaller.  My interests are taking great memory photos indoors and outdoors and this camera has been excellent.  Although I have a movie camera, this one serves perfectly for short clips for our website.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Great Photographic Companion", "Author": "Jarrod Sams", "ReviewID": "R2ANRWR4XEJMFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as my first digital camera.  I researched all of the usual suspects and then found this camera in a store.  It instantly became my choice.  Although I find this camera to be an excellent piece of equipment, it isn't perfect, but more on that in a moment.First, the camera is very easy to use and comfortable to hold.  Many compacts, especially those with large LCDs like this one, cram your fingers into confined spaces making them uncomfortable for prolonged use.  The LUMIX, while not the thinnest compact on the market, is a nice size that is portable, but comfortable in use.  The screen is easy to read, even outdoors, and features both a power mode to boost brightness when outdoors and a high angle mode for when you're shooting over your head.  The lens on this camera is NICE with a useful 28mm wide angle to a respectable telephoto end for a compact and the lens has excellent distortion control.  I love the zoom on this camera as it is very precise.  Most compacts lurch when zoomed in or out, but the LUMIX zooms smoothly with a multitude of stops allowing fine adjustment.  The best part is the Mega O.I.S. which works perfectly.  Never again will I by a camera without it.Overall, the features and function of this camera is great.  Solid build quality and quick performance.  The photos taken are beautiful.  Good color without over saturating and decent noise control at lower ISOs.  But, the camera does have its drawbacks.  Noise can become an issue at higher sensitivities and can even creep in at lower setting during long exposures.  While I don't find it terrible, it is noticeable at times especially when shooting in dark conditions.  The functionality of the camera is also limited when trying to force a long exposure, but to be fair this is not a SLR, but a little more timer settings could be useful for night photography.Again, overall I have enjoyed this camera and taken some wonderful pictures.  If I had to do it over again I would likely buy this camera again.  I would appreciate a little better noise performance, but the LUMIX is not really that bad once you learn how to work around it.  I would recommend this camera, in fact I have, and I don't think anyone who buys one will be disappointed.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "FX50, the good and the bad", "Author": "Paul Deleeuw \"pdl1\"", "ReviewID": "R1HIRIEQ64KLPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A good camera. Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, it is ready within 2 seconds to take a picture. Pluses: big viewscreen, bright and sharp. Good battery life. Uses SD card. Controls are easy and menus accessible. Pictures are good, but all cameras take good pictures these days.Bad: Optics are limited, no real wide angle, zoom is limited. Has optical image stabilization (as opposed to digital) so it only works with the optical zoom. When you really need stabilization, at extreme zooms, its not there. Has trouble focusing in relatively low light.At $250 it would be a bargain.
