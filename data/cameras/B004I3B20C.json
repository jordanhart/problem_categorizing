You definitely get your money out of it.  Uses 3 aa batteries and they recommend that you don't use rechargeables.  The energizers I put in mine have lasted over a month so the battery use seems to be minimal", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very cheap adequate camera", "Author": "James F.

I had actually bought it hoping it would take distorted, toy-camera, type pictures and was disappointed to find it took normal adequate pictures.

The package advertises this camera as being able to take 120 pictures. But when you open the package and read the instructions you find out that you can take 12 pictures if you like to have the \"highest resolution\" (a joke by itself).The camera does not allow for memory expansion.The camera does not have a flash -- that is, any pictures taken indoors are useless.The door of the compartment that holds the batteries opens easily -- and if it does open, you lose all the pictures you have taken.This item belongs in the dollar store -- sold 2 for $1.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great gift idea", "Author": "Carmen Carlson", "ReviewID": "R1LE5PNB0E0AOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got for my 10 year old niece and she has the best time with it.

I was looking for a simple shoot and click camera my Grandmother could use so she didn't have to keep buying disposables. This was not a good answer. It cannot capture a picture very well and is very delayed. There is no flash and none of the pictures turned out anywhere near clear.
