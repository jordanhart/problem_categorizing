{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kept my old Coolpix S5 going for years, so I could use this", "Author": "Scary Blonde Chick", "ReviewID": "RMZJ0ES1L1LOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This jacket is indeed waterproof. My Nikon Coolpix S5 takes excellent underwater photos with this case, and the combo has been used down to about 10 meters (30 feet) - though I freely admit the jacket is not rated for that depth, and I knew we were taking a chance using it that deep. When I carried this combo, and my husband carried the more expensive (but also outdated) Sealife Reefmaster, my rig produced the better pictures by far, particularly in lower light conditions of deeper water. Color correction is easily accomplished with even the most basic photo editing software, and will help to give life to otherwise monotonal blue photos, since there is no way for this rig to accommodate a red filter. I have been using this jacket with the Coolpix S5 for many years now, and have avoided retiring the S5 so that I can keep on doing so. However, since both the jacket and the device are outdated and unsupported, the price of both together approaches that of the better dedicated-use underwater cameras ... so to be honest I cannot recommend their purchase, even though I have been simply delighted with their use and longevity.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000ETTG2U"}}
