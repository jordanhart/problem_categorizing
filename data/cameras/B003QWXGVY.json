{"Reviews": [{"Title": "major flaws, not really 720p, needs a firmware update", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3P27W4XEW7HN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera had a good price, but it is a disappointment.  Note that this is an older model; the latest models have an HDMI port and fewer bugs.* Not 720p / JPEG encoding artifacts: -1 StarThe CCD in this camera is natively 640x480.  If you choose the 720p recording mode, then  the camera just does pixel-doubling in software.This dashcam records to MJPEG files.  You won't be able to read license plates or recognize most faces because of compression artifacts.  The firmware lacks an option for changing JPEG quality.* Stops Recording When SD Card Is Full: -1 StarWhen the dashcam needs to rotate files on the SD card, it stops recording for up to two minutes, but an entire accident can happen in less than two minutes.  The actual amount of offline time seems to depend on the speed of the SD card.* Can't override poweroff:  -1 StarThis dashcam always powers off when external power disconnects, even if the internal battery if fully charged.  I want my dashcam to continue recording after an accident.* Can't run from a USB Port / Can't be used as a webcam:  -1 StarConnecting the USB port puts the camera into disk mode, which means that you must power it from the 5v connector.  You cannot power this dashcam from an in-vehicle USB port.  You cannot use this dashcam as a webcam.* Can't invert or rotate the video:  AnnoyanceThe firmware doesn't have an option for changing the recording orientation.* Can't change the recording overlays: AnnoyanceThe only overlay option is a timestamp.* Nearly ideal form factor: +1 StarThe size and shape of this dashcam is nearly perfect, and it uses a standard threaded mount, like on a regular camera tripod.  It is much smaller than the stock photography makes it seem.  The built-in folding LCD is probably the best feature.* Adequate performance in a variety of lighting conditions: +1Sun flaring is minor.  Quality is okay at night with street lights and head lights.* Additional NotesThis camera records to MJPEG AVI with 8 kHz PCM mono audio.  Audio quality is poor; you can't hear conversations over white noise while driving, and it is unlikely that you would get all of a conversation while stopped with a traffic cop.Wake-up on motion detection is pretty good.In standard quality, this camera uses 2GB per hour.Power draw is less than 5 watts at 5 volts, so you can run this camera off of a car battery for a long time.This camera seems to be running an embedded BSD.  A firmware update could get me to add one or two stars to this review.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera to protect yourself", "Author": "Cautious Shopper", "ReviewID": "R2FXPRRL0T8PD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this camera to protect myself from the lousy/agressive drivers in our area that seem to be growing by leaps and bounds.  I have been using the camera for about a month now with an 8 GB card.  Using the default video settings (mid range for capture) the 8 GB card stores about 3 hours of good quality video.  The 120 degree field of view can capture the traffic lights even if you are at the stop line.  Very Strong Sun Glare did not harm the camera although the objects were all darkened since they were all backlit.  Night time capture is adequate based off of the headlights but don't expect daytime capture.  (The IR cameras are described as not being able to go through the glass windshield so not much of an option.) The auto start/stop and auto rollover works as advertised.  The products instructions are really poor.  (I suspect that the unit is made in Russia since the only other instructions are in Russian, but so is the Mig-29!)  If you want to change the defaults (e.g. I wanted a 15 min. capture window and setting the date.) You need to fumble with the buttons on the left first pressing MENU twice and then rec/snap to get the camera into the change mode and then use the buttons on the right to get the values to change.  If you miss the right year you need to go past 2034 and then it rolls back to the start year.

don't have insurance and drunk wrong way drivers are # 1 on the list. This camera works great as described, very good video and sound recordings. Very recommended at this great price. The video was edited with Nero and lost some Quality, also if I cleaned my windschield before the view was much better, at the video you will see a vehicle turned to the right on red, and almost was hit by another driver. Just be prepared and protect yourself :-)", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good value", "Author": "Robbert Patrison", "ReviewID": "R7LHY1PHCL2NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Car DVR recorder with fairly low expectations, both given the very low price and the very mixed reviews at Amazon. After a thorough test and break-in, I am positively surprised. I would recommend this as a low cost way to record evidence for unexpected cases where it is useful to replay the past accurately.The DVR is produced by an unidentified Chinese company. It is surprisingly good for something that's made and designed in China. There is a flip-down LCD screen of decent quality that can be used for setup and instant playback. Opening up the small unit revealed a clean printed circuit board with just 2 chips: a Korean memory chip and a CPU chip of unknown origin. Control is through 6 buttons on either sides. Its not as convenient as a touch screen, but it does the job. The included suction mount was bulkier and less flexible than the one on the picture. This design does not allow mounting the using behind the rear-view mirror, so I need to look for some more compact suction mount.The unit runs on it built-in battery power for at least an hour. This allows the camera to be used in the same was a a flip camera. Its small and light enough for use as a spy cam or on board of a model airplane. Plugged into the cigarette lighter adapter, the DV starts recording automatically when the car starts, and stops about 30 seconds after the ignition is cut. This is the desired behavior for a 'black box'.The included manual is terrible, as expected. Special highlight is the final section \"Small tip to save you big headache\" which describes the many blessings of the reset button. The manual is not adapted for the different versions on the product, describing features that do not exist (such as HDMI output, frame rate selection, audio on/off) and omitting some useful options that are supported. Using some trial and error, however, its not too hard to find your way.Video quality is indeed nowhere near HD standard. I could not see any difference in resolution between the 'XVGA' and 'VGA', so its best to stick with basic VGA which results in a 30% smaller files and a higher frame refresh rate. The camera sensor is likely the culprit. The lens is wide angle, producing a decent panoramic view with the usual distortion around the corners. Color reproduction is weak. Given the 'black box' application we don't care too much about that. Low light performance is passable. Though not HD, the quality is still better than the standard resolution camcorders of only a few years ago. Sound quality is poor, with lots of hissing, but conversations in the car are easy to understand.The DVR performs decent image stabilization, which causes the movies to be quite smooth, even on bumpy roads. That is a very useful undocumented feature. Other undocumented features include digital zoom and a few image viewing options. The picture includes a date and time stamp for record keeping. The built-in clock turns out to be stable and accurate.The DVR records .avi movies in segments of up to 15 minutes. There is only a short 1 second gap between the segments. The gap was a major complaint in most other reviews, but its pretty good on my unit. Apparently the new firmware improved this. Each 15-minute .avi file is about 720Mb which should yield about 11 hours of total recording on a 32G SD card before old files are overwritten. The LCD display shows the estimated remaining recording time, though the value is on the optimistic side.Playback on the built-in LCD screen is decent. This feature could save your day, for instance instantly proving to a cop that you are not on the cell phone while driving. There is no fast forward, unfortunately, which makes it a pain to find the proper scene. Plugging in the unit in a computer mounts the SD card as a hard drive. The USB data transfer rate cannot keep up with the video bit rate in my experience. I am not sure whether this is caused by the SD card I am using or whether its due to the USB interface. Its not a big problem, as files can be copied to the PC for smooth playback. Playback on using video signal on a TV possible, but its just not very useful.Overal, this DVR does the job for very little money. Compared to the other options (such as Itronics), it does nearly the same job and sports a built-in screen at a fraction of the price. It lacks HD and GPS, but neither of those are really essential for a car 'black box'.Update May 2013 (1.5 year later): The dashcam is still working flawlessly, faithfully recording whenever my car drives.  Same product now costs even less.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "For people having fuzzy image : read this !", "Author": "olivier", "ReviewID": "R1LZS7B4JQPVVC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the same kind of device and the image was focusing only around 50cm meaning somebody or something beyond 50cm was completely fuzzy so the cam was useless...Actually the focus is simply set by adjusting the lens like you can do with binaculars.

First, it took them till the end of the 3rd day to ship it which caused total delivery time to be around 9-10 days. I received it and it is one of those Chinese drop ship items. It has a surprising range of features for the price, such as auto on/off and auto record triggered by power from the cigarette lighter adapter. When the sd card is full it will loop the record and overwrite the oldest files first. The built in battery allows it to properly close out the files when the power from the adapter is cut so, in an accident, losing power will not cause you to lose the current file; which may be the most important one. The unit I received did not have a hdmi port like the photo but the opening is still cut into the casing; found this after the inspection sticker fell off after the 2nd day of use. Playback is not possible on this device. I have used 2 sdhc cards which says on the box are supported; one Kingston class 6 4gb card and one transcend class 10 16gb card. Trying to initiate playback with either card results in \"one moment\" appearing on the screen followed by the word \"one\" disappearing leaving half of the \"o\" yet, nothing else happens(waited up to 5min). Occasionally it will indicate \"fwd 1x\" but still not play, pressing the up button sometimes causes it to display \"bwd 1x\" but nothing plays. In the whole playback attempt process it will randomly give 2-3mm wide vertical lines of distorted picture over the still image of the first video frame. Another thing to note is the video format of the files it creates are AVI. A 4gb card will give 2:20 hr:min of record in VGA format and 1:22 hr:min in D1 and SXGA. 16gb card increased the VGA to over 9 hours. When transferring the video files to your computer you better use a sd card adapter because the maximum transfer speed that this thing can handle is apparently 1 mb/s. The video seems clear enough to see what is going on in a wide angle area in front of you but is not sharp enough to read the license plate off of the car in front of you sitting at a traffic light. I have not used when fully dark but twilight recordings are good in detail except oncoming headlights cause moments where the camera is basically blinded. The video displays on the lcd so it is right side up when the unit is mounted with the lcd folding down when opened, with no option that allows you to change this if you choose to mount it in any other orientation; like mounting it to your dash with the lcd folding up when opened.

It has long wires, that simply plug in into your car charger (works through an extension as well, if you wanna plug other devices too), and then forget about it. It will automatically switch on everytime your car is turned on, and hence is a good safety device to be used in an accident.2) Accepts upto 32GB - this is good, as it is able to record upto 12 hours of continuous driving.3) Automatically creates .avi files - just click them to watch the videos, no conversion required.4) Records good audio - it can record all the songs i am playing in the car and GPS voices, etc.5) Suction cup mechanism - it is a very strong attachment, and does keep the camera very stable on the windshield.Some of the cons are:1) Can't read license plates - it's not that much

First off, overall rating Thumbs up with few minor issues.  HD? dont even try it.. the VGA standard is just as good I believe.This unit was easy to mount, long enough power adapter to run along the seems of the door to the of the rearview mirror.  The unit records video just like you would see on regular broadcast non-hd television which is fine for just evidence of how the crash or incident happened.  License plates..only up real close.  The features are just really small not even worth mentioning.  It was meant to record and view..Now I suggest like some others recording at 5 minutes instead of 10 or 1 minute.  It will catch what happens better before jumping 2 to 3 seconds between files. It will have a better chance of saving your file instead of the 10 minute video which might lose battery charge.I'm going to test the battery to see how long it last here in the future and I will revise the review.  The auto start and record function works fine with most vehicles that have a Power Accessory Outlet that cuts off after you turn the car off...If yours doesnt and stays on like my H3.. You have to actually physically hit record to stop and power off.  When I get in the car I have to actually hit the power ON because my outlet is 24/7 live.  NOTE: if this is something important to you..check your outlet first.Overall: Not the police hard drive dashcams like watchguard..but it will do for the commute or traveling for most.One other thing..forget the audio..it doesnt pick up well.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "not HD, not even close...", "Author": "LastKarankawa \"LastKarankawa\"", "ReviewID": "R3ITM4S87TB83I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "And the picture is one of the worse I've seen, and I see a lot because I buy these often for a device I make and sell to the film industry.

Sorry but this is true.Motion Detect Car Dash Video Camera Recorder DVR", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very poor image quality, this is NOT HD.", "Author": "Dmitri Toptygin", "ReviewID": "R23NE42EUTLDPO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this \"720P HD motion detect car dash video camera recorder 2.5 inch TFT LCD 1280x720, 30fps\" as a birthday present about three weeks ago. By now I have tested all its operating modes, and I am completely dissatisfied. I do not recommend this DVR, because it cannot really provide useful evidence in the case of an accident.The resolution is totally unacceptable. Theoretically 720P should look crisp on a wide screen TV, but the video from this DVR looks terribly fuzzy on every screen. A 720P DVR should be able to reproduce 360 white and 360 black horizontal lines (a total of 720 horizontal lines) or 640 white and 640 black vertical lines (a total of 1280 vertical lines). For the resolution test I have long sheets of paper with hundreds of white and black stripes of equal width. I spent an hour taking pictures of these stripes from different distances, both in horizontal and in vertical orientation. Here are the results: 70 white and 70 black horizontal lines (140 total), 120 white and 120 black vertical lines (240 total). This is about one fifth of the resolution that is normally considered \"High Definition\". Why is the resolution so bad? First, the optics (the lens) is very cheap. In fact, this is the worst of all lenses I saw on webcams and digital photo cameras. Second, the sensor does not have enough pixels for true HD quality.Color reproduction is completely unacceptable. If there is a traffic light in the field of view, it is always white. The red light is white, the green is white, and the yellow is also white. The only way to tell which light is on is by its position (top means red, bottom means green). However, because of the poor resolution you cannot see whether the top or the bottom is on unless the distance to the traffic light is less than 30 feet. When you are further than 120 feet from the traffic light, you cannot see whether there is a traffic light at all (it completely vanishes against the blue sky). At distances between 30 and 120 feet you can see a bright white spot (brighter than the background), and closer than 30 feet you see a dark rectangle with a white spot at the top (means read), at the bottom (green), or in the middle (yellow). Grass is usually more or less green, and you can also see colors of other large objects if they are not too bright. Unfortunately, the colors on a traffic light are so bright that the sensor becomes saturated and then every color becomes white.It is absolutely impossible to read the license plate of a car right in front of you when you drive at a close distance or when you are parked on a parking lot and the distance between the cars is just one foot. If you move any closer, then the hood of your own car will block the license plate you are trying to read, but on the video from this DVR you still cannot read the number. When you drive on a highway, you cannot tell whether the car in front of you has a license plate at all. Likewise, road signs are all just rectangles, you cannot read what's on them.Sound quality: try to speak loud and then listen to the record. You should be able to recognize that this is a human voice, but it is not possible to understand the words.The DVR has a HDMI connector. I bought a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable and tried to connect this DVR to different TV sets. It turns out that there is no HDMI output signal. You can view the video only using the USB port (for this you need a computer, not just a TV set).I tried HD resolution and VHS resolution, in combination with 10, 20, and 30 frames per second, both with and without sound. I hoped that maybe one of these combinations will provide acceptable image quality, but this did not happen.Conclusion: HD is a joke.

Felt that these features were not necessary for a extra $200.This camera does not come with instructions but its practically self explanatory.  Purchased a 16gb sd card which records over 5 hrs with this camera.  Camera isn't the greatest since you cannot really see license plates of the car in front - only if you are practically on theyre bumper.

While it is saving that file, it is not recording so there is a 6- 10 second loss in time which could very well be critical video you needed. So if a critical event occurs while the camera is saving the previous time segment, you have no video.I use the  video copilot VC-100 which uses a ccd lens instead of cmos and has a better night quality picture and best of all, it does not record in segments. It starts recording as soon as it gets power from the ignition and continues till it is turned off in one video.You can choose the time you need to backup and save for evidence and there is no risk of previous time not being there.

I set the camera to record 15 minute intervals.  When the card is full, it takes about 8 seconds to delete the oldest file and start a new one.  When the camera is set to record 5 minute intervals, it takes about 3 seconds for the same process.  This is good to know because the \"near accident\" happened at about the 14:45 mark.  Another 15 seconds and I would have missed the entire situation.  I try to delete the files every other day so that I get continous recording (takes about 1 second between recordings).

Design-wise the description is not accurate as several of the other reviewers noted: it is not HD. In fact, if you try to switch it to the higher resolution mode, it will crash the device.

After a few days of constantly pushing the reset button because of the bricking, it seized for good, and now won't power on at all.Those are the bad points - the device fails outright in just a few weeks. However, this device also has some GOOD points and if they could just fix the obvious firmware problems, it would probably be a really good purchase for the money. What's neat about it is that it comes on automatically when the car starts, and records convenient video segments. When you turn your car off, it writes the final segment to its SD card and shuts itself off automatically - you don't have to mess with it. Video segments are easy to retrieve from the SD card. In these respects, it's very well designed as a plug-and-play-and-forget-about-it device for users of lower technical skill.Except for the fatal firmware flaws, that is.

Unfortunately the most recent ones come with the language in Chinese. So maybe go to your local restaurant and have them translate it for you. Other than that, it's a great inexpensive unit. I have an older version and the HD is not fully 30fps, but I still suggest it as it gives much better detail. Also, don't use 3 or 5 minute files. Use 15, it takes about 4 seconds for the unit to change from one file to the next. I had mine on 3 minutes, and it missed a collision.Now I've actually used this to establish fault in an accident I was involved in. The other driver claimed I crossed the double yellow line, but the video evidence showed I did no such thing and that *he* drive into me, even though the exact moment of impact was not caught. I gave one to my dad for Christmas who was later side-swiped by a tow truck and the tow-truck driver claimed my dad drifted out of his lane. The video evidence proved otherwise. I also have recorded several drunk drivers. If they had an accident I'd be able to provide that as evidence. This may not be the best unit, but it is the cheapest and I recommend *everyone* get one. Also, cops like to claim \"erratic driving\" for a reason to pull people over and search their vehicles. This will provide the evidence that the police's claim was false, invaliding the ticket and or arrests.A couple notes: if your car's cigarette lighter is always active, it will record 24/7. It does not drain my battery though. It has a battery in it which will last several minutes at least(I don't know how long), meaning you can take it on the go, and would record parking lot events for several minutes after ou turn the car off as well if your lighter doesn't remain active.A 3-minute file on HD takes 160MB. (2GB flash = 37 minutes, 4GB=1.25h 8GB=2.5h) It'll recycle when it gets full as long as you have a time-limited file (I think the new ones only go up to 15 minutes, older ones could fill the drive then stop recording)It has a microphone which is almost useless.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compare to price, it is WORTHY", "Author": "AKM MOINUL HAQUE", "ReviewID": "R19TUEO7M4R5LX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you looking for only vehicle insurance purpose, it is definitely worthy except YOU WILL NOT ABLE TO READ THE LICENSE PLATE due to quality of the video.

Lin \"yesuaini99\"", "ReviewID": "R1QTEC4I2L5DLO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After watching several traffic accident videos (taped exactly from Car DVR like this one), I decided to buy one and test it out.My friend was involved in a minor fender bender; someone had changed lane without looking and scratched her rear view mirror on my friend's side panel.After they got out of the car to work out the situation, the other car's driver claims it was my friend's fault.He decided to buy a Car DVR due to this incident and I've decided to follow.For $36 and a little work on installation (very easy), you can have peace of mind knowing next time some crazy driver wants to argue fault, you have the evidence to back up everything.One warning, I don't know if the seller specifically says that it doesn't come with any SD card.  So unless you have a spare SD card, it's not ready for use right out of the box.I am ordering another one today for my other car.Check out Youtube for some very detailed reviews on similar items.The video files recorded in the SD can be played back in my Mac very easily without any additional drivers.Once you turn on the engine, it turns on by itself and starts recording.If you have the setting turned on motion sensitive, then after you stop recording, it will start to record again if your car has movement (not too sensitive, but enough if the entire scene is moving.)It has a little fish-eye lens so it records much more than other DVRs that somehow has a \"zoomed-in\" effect.The unit is light weight, and very easy to use.  The instruction manual is in both English and Chinese.I recommend this to anyone who lives in a heavily populated metro area or anyone like my friend who wants a peace of mind.It's very inexpensive to have this in addition to your car insurance.Apparently the mini HDMI doesn't work but the mini USB does.  So you can bring a lap top to your car if you don't have a SD reader (the device needs to be powered on to transfer the files from SD card.I have it set on recording in 15 min slots.  There will be 2 second blank when closing one file and starting another one.  I have class 6 SD in the device and still has the lag.The instruction is very clear, straight forward and easy to understand.  You don't need to be an engineer to install this thing or getting files out of it.Just buy any 8GB SD card and this unit, you can enjoy the peace mind.The recording file size is quite significant if you set to 1280.  I drove around for less than 10 min and it's already several hundred megabytes.The 12V adapter cable is long enough you can basically install anywhere in your car and still get power.(You can opt to mount it under the moonroof if you want to video part of the inside of the vehicle too. This way, with the fish-eye lens, you can capture pretty much the entire area before the driver seat.)Below is a review for my 2nd unit purchased on Amazon.It's from a different vendor.Even though the retail box appears to be the same with the first unit, the content is slightly different.The main DVR unit is the same however, the mounting kit and the power adapter is different.The mounting kit is better in this unit.  It is smaller.  It comes with a swivel mount like that on a mini tripod.  It can rotate 360 degrees at many different angles.  The screw mount is also a tiny bit deeper (1 1/4 turn to fasten tight, where as the previous unit is only 3/4 turn to fasten, so it comes lose very easily with just a simple turn)Here comes the bad part.  The power adapter cable to the cigarette lighter is too short.  The previous unit provides enough length for you to take it over the sun visor, down the A-pillar (hidden inside the body panels and down under the glove compartment then up to the 12V power.  This one is only about 1/2 as long.  I measured the length, it's under 6\" which makes it impossible to hide the cord and thus have to hang directly from the rear view mirror down to the 12V.Also, the way the main unit responds to power on/off is a slightly different.The first unit, once you turn the ignition power off, it also turns off after about 10-15 seconds.This one just remains on for over 1 min, until the internal battery power is drained.The silicon suction cup on this 2nd unit is also inferior in quality.  It has lots of grease on it and it even fell off when I mounted it on the windshield.  So I washed it and wiped it dry and hopefully it will stay secure this time for a while.The recording quality is the same as the first unit.  Again, the HD in a 16x9 format simply means the screen you see is not exactly what is recorded.  You need to point the camera slightly downward to get the most out of the recording.  Otherwise, you would be recording 2/3 the sky and not much the road.Test the unit by driving around a few minutes and then retrieve the SD card and see it in your computer first.  Adjust the angle after viewing the test run so you get the best results.Still recommend this, but I am going to contact the seller to provide a longer cable if possible.3rd updateAfter using it for only 2 days, it shows a dead battery.It's not charing and the motion activation doesn't work.After my car is stopped and engine off, it continues to record for a full 15 min, every single time!!! until the battery dies.And while driving, the screen displays \"LOW BATTERY\" in huge red letters with a big X across the battery mark on the bottom left corner.It has a faulty battery and a faulty chip board.I am returning this one tomorrow and get a replacement.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "WAO", "Author": "TOMMY GARCIA \"TOMMY GARCIA\"", "ReviewID": "R20G56R31KAFU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS PRODUCT ITS A NICE PRODUCT TO HAVE, THIS CAN SHOW U WHO IS NEXT TO YOUR CAR AND RECORDE IT.

I picked up an SD4/32GB Kingston card. With a card designed for fast operations (digital camera, fast repeat images, etc) you'll see much faster results and no delay. My timestamp from one 15 minute segment ends at 15:39 and the next video picks up at 15:39; and the performance is consistent across all segments.Next is that this product is absolutely NOT HD quality. You cannot read someone's license plate in any mode even if you are kissing their bumper. If someone hits you and drives off then don't bother with trying to track them down with the video; you won't see their plate in the video. The 1280x720 mode only doubles the pixels; so it's best to leave it in 640x480 or 848x480 mode (according to the manual it's 848x480 but the output is actually 720x480).The sound recording is pretty bad and not worth having. It doesn't pick up enough to be usable, but it records enough that it could land you in a lot of legal trouble under Federal law. I'd suggest advising people that you are potentially recording conversations as a function of your in-dash recording (ie, police).The mount seems to be OK. The cord to plug into the cigarette light is pretty long which is nice. Ultimately, this serves my purpose of recording events, ranging from standing in front of it and performing exchanges to recording potential accidents.I'm not looking for anything much better but if you need crisp videos and such then save your money and buy something better. This is definitely not for professionals or anyone who needs to record detailed videos.May 27th, 2012 Update:Frequently when I get in my car I'm finding the camera is turned off and will not turn on. If I leave it unplugged for about 10 minutes and plug it back in then it seems to come back. The only cause I can find is that it's getting warmer outside, but I'm in Seattle and our temperatures aren't even peaking 75f yet.

It worked like a charm! Suction mount, perfect. Video quality, I never used the HD...didn't need to. The 640 setting was just fine for proving who doesn't know how to drive, if I had an accident. The temperature dipped to -1C (Canada) - and I tried to power it up...nothing. The screen blinked, froze...the unit shut down. Reset after Reset, after Reset...I was hoping to get a year or two atleast. It didn't even last two weeks. I want one after seeing what it could do, but I guess I'm going to have to fork out some bigger dough for a name brand model or something. Sorry folks, I really wanted to write a postive review - I had high hopes for this thing.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dash cam", "Author": "861400lx", "ReviewID": "R1AXAJYIUH0UQM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera was in a different language and could not be changed so weather was giid ir nor Could get it inro american si I could use it.For this reason I give it one star", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003QWXGVY"}}
