{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointing POE Camera", "Author": "J. Lawler", "ReviewID": "R397R9YT0CDXRL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me start by stating that I had to return this IP camera. The major reason is that it does not have exposure compensation and it has a manual focus. It is configured for indoor ambient light settings.  Not too bright and not too dim.  I also realized that the camera/CCD chip does not have a sufficient dynamic range to capure a scene with both bright and dard areas.  If this is a requirement, then this camera will not perform for you.The Trendnet software does provide image brightness controls but the controls appear to operate on the received image not setting the camera's exposure settings.  Hence an over exposed image will remain overexposed.TrendNet has Setup program on the CD which installs a setup program!  This is rather confusing.  Installation is clumsy but with patience, I got it configured.  The Power over Ethernet worked perfectly.Based on physical construction, including the pacement of the connectors, the TrendNet Camera appears to be a Dlink camera. In fact using Blue Iris Video Monitoring software, the camera responds as if it is a DLink DCS-3410 or 2102.The focus is manual.  A real PITA when you must mount it and then have someone monitor the video and keep farting with the focus.  And given the 1-2 second delay in the video, its easy to keep missing the focus point.Trendnet also provides a simple but good mounting bracket.I also tried out their user support.  I connected to a person relatively quickly.  I offer them the opportunity to the tech support person to connect directly to the camera remotely which they declined (I configured port forwarding on my router).  Their first fix for the over exposure was to place the camera in night mode!!  What??  That would make it even more over exposed!  They ignored my comment.  Put me  on hold and when they came back and she said it can't be used for viewing outside.Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Toshiba line of IP cameras.  They are a lot more expensive, but their engineering, software and hardware is top notch compared to TrendNet.  So if your needs are for video where the lighting does not vary much from ambient indoor lighting, and you can only afford $200, this camera may work for you.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great basic camera!", "Author": "Bill \"bmega\"", "ReviewID": "R1AMIB7MD76GJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 4x zoom model and it is easy to set up and use.  I mounted mine in an outdoor camera housing to monitor the outside of my home.  I have no trouble connecting to it from work and the picture is clear.  The 4x zoom does cause the picture to get grainy (as expected), but I don't have much use for the zoom as I am looking for an overall view of the area.  I had no trouble focusing the camera with my laptop connected to my home network - any further and the delay would have made focusing a pain.  The microphone works fine and I'm also satisfied with it's performance in low light.  The low-watt bulb that I have in my porch light provides enough light for the camera to view the entire porch area late at night.  When the motion flood lights are activated, there is more than enough light for the camera.  This is a good choice for a basic internet security camera.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Franklin Rolando Orellana \"IT Consultores\"", "ReviewID": "RSIQ6HBONFYHO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The quality of this camera is what you would expect for the price, regular. The default settings are not ok for use outdoor, and you can't change that unless you update the firmware of the device, which is what we did and after that i worked ok indoor and outdoor (we didn't knew that the firmware fixed this problem since we didn't find anything that suggested it but thanks to that we didn't have to return it or use it only indoor).You can access the camera from any navigator (we tried IE, FF and Opera), but some advanced functions are only available in IE.The zoom is not that useful since its just digital and the image resolution is not very good.The software detects the camera without problem even if you don't know it's IP so it save us a couple of times from rebooting it.We've tried for a few days now and everything seems ok even when using it with ddns.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent value for the money", "Author": "M. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2KOAKHGNJNNYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Originally I purchased the TV-IP512P to use outside with an enclosure. It wasn't until AFTER I received it that the documentation states it's for indoor use. Indoors, it works great, though I use it to monitor remotely and picture quality isn't a big issue. I mounted the camera outside in the enclosure and as a few reviews have stated, the picture is blown out with outdoor light levels. I put a small piece of window tint over the enclosure window to reduce the light level and though it does take away from picture quality ever so slightly, the picture quality is still acceptable. I will be buying another for inside use in the near future.****UPDATE****After contacting Trendnet support about the light level for exterior use, I was told to do a firmware upgrade. After doing the upgrade, I had the option for indoor or outdoor use. Set on outdoor, I removed the tint I applied previously (to cut down the light level), and was pleased to find the picture is no longer washed out, and is FAR better than before. Next I'll be trying the IR500 infrared lens to see if visibility at night is increased.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Eh... wish i would have spent a bit more on a better camera", "Author": "jasonb", "ReviewID": "R3EZ4TFOMFNUSQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The good:Easy to set up, works with standard POE switches.  Mounts on top and bottom, comes with a right angle bracket.  Web interface is nice and easy to use.  Works with Zoneminder.  JPG's upload to an FTP server just fine.The bad:Focus is a manual focus.  I knew this going in, but i didn't realize how annoying it would be.  My biggest gripe and the main reason for the low rating is that you can't browse the SD card through the camera interface.  You have to take it out and put it in a pc to read it.

They certainly get the job done in good light.  A little hard to see in dim light, worthless in dark (to be expected at this price).  Easy set-up - recording to an external network drive.  Does take a hearty CPU to run more than one camera on the software.  Software takes a little research, but trendnet sight is good place to start.  Would definitely recommend as an inexpensive solution to home security - not to mention that just the presence of the cameras is a good deterrent.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, interchangable lenses and terrific low light sensitivity.", "Author": "Protobug", "ReviewID": "R37XUNIZ1B42S6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several security cameras and these are the only one that will give a very clear image at night with my security lights for illumination. It has a night time setting to slow the shutter speed to accomplish the low light sensitivity. I bought a 4mm lens for mine for about ten dollars to give the camera a wider field of view. I just bought my third one of these and a 2mm fish eye but have yet to install it to try it out. This is a great camera and I would give it five stars if Trendnet would increase the resolution.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent low-cost bird-feeder camera", "Author": "Keflex", "ReviewID": "R1CS85YXMDPMPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to train out a kitchen window box on a set of seed feeders in our back yard. It has the two features I absolutely required: Power Over Ethernet (POE)--which means I can power it using the same cable that sends and receives networking information (less clutter)--and a CS lens mount, which means I can replace the lens with something more powerful. I bought a cheap (sub-$50) high-power zoom lens designed for a CCTV security camera from a home-security store (I'm sure there are zillions of them for sale here on Amazon too) and slapped it on in place of the factory lens. Throw in a POE injector and a set of PowerLine network adapters to hook it to my home network....bam, instant birdy cam. Much higher-quality image than the software-based zoom built into the camera. The image quality is not up to the standards of other, more expensive IP cameras, to be sure, but with a little finagling you can get a perfectly decent picture out of the thing. I also like that you have the option of retrieving the stream in a number of formats: still JPEG images, MJPEGs and MPEG movies. As others have said, make sure you update the firmware to the latest build; some features are not available without it. For my purposes, this camera was just about a perfect match.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "gregry", "ReviewID": "RJ669WU7X5EKZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is inexpensive as far as PoE cameras go. Do not buy if you're looking for high resolution. I'm using it for monitoring a vehicle gate. The camera is about 50 yards from the gate. Something the size of a vehicle is about the minimum size for clarity. Picture is pixelated even at the highest resolution.

They have worked well if your expectations are not too high for picture quality.This camera was a nice upgrade to POE, picture was better, plus there was less noise (white specs on the picture at night).

Couldn't get the motion detection to record properly.  Other than that, it works pretty well with the software that comes with it.  But I bought a different TRENDnet PTZ camera and it came with it's own software.  Neither camera works with the other's software.  I found that to be very aggravating.  Also, I use LuxRIOT VMS and found the cameras do not integrate well with that system either.  I guess if you are setting up a stand-alone system with all the same cameras, the TRENDnet products would be okay.
