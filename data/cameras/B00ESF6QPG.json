{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You need a new hobby. Here's a great starter kit.  2 MONTH UPDATE", "Author": "Retired Engineer \"gadget geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2WVZO039OURLD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really love this camera. Auto-Focus is crisp, Image Stabilization in the telephoto lenses, 7 shots per second continuous shooting, 20+ Megapixels, touch-screen, HD movie capability, and the availability of all those Canon accessories.This package comes with 5 lenses and 2 add-on lenses (macro & telephoto). The Cannon 70D and the 5 Canon lenses individually cost as much as this kit. It also has one Cannon battery with charger, and two aftermarket batteries with their own charger (the aftermarket batteries are higher capacity, so I wouldn't try to swap chargers). Everything you would need to take a digital photography class. Some of the accessories are a French brand called X-it. They're all functional, though not as nice as the Canon branded products in this kit. It actually won't all fit in the camera bag which comes with the kit._____________________10-WEEK UPDATE - I dropped a star because some of the non-Canon accessories are cheap crap. But I did the math again and its still a good value overall.I still really love this camera kit.  HOWEVER, a few of its parts ain't quite all that.The included external flash is not Canon branded and DOES NOT WORK WITH THE CAMERA.  OOPS!!  The camera's built-in flash works well.The kit comes with two generic batteries and their charger. They work, but they don't last as long as the Canon branded battery. The kit also comes with one Canon battery and charger. They are great.NOTE: The Canon battery is rated at 1800 mAh. The generic (Halcyon) batteries claim 2400 mAh, which would be 33% GREATER power capacity. In reality, they last roughly half as long.The included all-in-one card reader looks like it came out of a Cracker-Jack box. It WORKS VERY WELL and I now appreciate that it fits in the camera bag.Its still a great value for the price. What if all you want is the camera body and one lens? The Canon EF-S 18-135 1:3.5-5.6 IS STM (included in this kit) is my new favorite lens of all time. I'm about to drop a gold nugget on its weather-sealed Pentax species for a K-50.In general, I have tried to keep this review confined to my impression of the overall kit. In the interest of full disclosure, I must say these things: I looked at a Nikon D7100. Its like a luxury car with no features compared to the Canon.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "How to wake up the thrill of life", "Author": "Cheri Coleman", "ReviewID": "R1OK42LTC8HPCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great camera package / follow the how to book (From Snapshot to Great Shot By Nicole S. Young) it gives you an assignment at the end of each chapter and it makes the learning curve fun / the only camera i have ever had was a point and shoot, so this was hard to make the jump to such a high quality camera ( I'm so glad i did ). This package is perfect for everyone from teens to senior citizens. It gives me thrill of getting out and trying new things with my camera, come home and review my shots on the computer and want to go and try again. Just like a kid with a new toy. Every step is a new and exciting adventure. What a great way to enter a new hobby.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 70D", "Author": "ilan", "ReviewID": "R1VLPCCYVBHQTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent Camera the Canon 70d exceeded my expectations.
