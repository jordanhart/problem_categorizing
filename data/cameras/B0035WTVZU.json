Long", "ReviewID": "R27ZQ71I966HWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the negative review about the bad imaging experienced with this camera. Well, yesterday I got the camera and went about taking some test shots to check for the indicated problems. If verified, I intended to box it up and send it back. I had sort of made a mistake when ordering it, and actually thought I was ordering another Fuji model that had more favorable reviews.Anyway, I took a bunch of pictures using many of the special features available with the camera. I was particularly attentive to shots taken at or near maximum zoom and closeups using the macros. I intentionally was a bit careless taking several shots of distinct objects using maximum zoom-- the results were most pleasing; only a couple of the 3 dozen shots were blurred. I also took aim at three of my neighborhood dog-friends who never stand still and the camera rendered them absolutely rigid. So, I rate the image stabilization as very good. The close-ups were also surprisingly good and I didn't bother with using a tripod or anything else to take the shots.So, I have trashed the box and will keep the camera.  It does a super job with the things I want it to do. Ansel Adams may have insisted upon something better, but I am very pleased with it.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best quality for the least money", "Author": "Geezer \"mizbooks\"", "ReviewID": "R11PHPR3F1GKQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most versatile camera for the most reasonable amount of money I've ever had.  Photography is a hobby for me, not a profession, so I want to be able to experiment with manual control, yet point and shoot with the family and pets so pictures will be spontaneous instead of posed.  There is nothing wanting in the quality of the images.  While the materials may be lighter than most high-end cameras, that's very much what I like about it.  It's well-made, if almost TOO small, and you don't feel like you're dragging around a boat anchor all day.  I have a more expensive \"prestigious\" camera, but may as well sell it for all the use it gets, because this is the one I use all the time.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Bridge Camera at Near Compact Price", "Author": "Rajendra S. Gondhalekar", "ReviewID": "R3QY4Y4MG2QCPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to replace the crappy Vivitar compact we bought a couple years ago.  That camera just would not lock autofocus onto anything in compact florescent lighting, and was very finicky to focus in natural light as well.  I wanted to get something better than a compact, and after a little bit of looking, settled onto the FujiFilm S2550HD.  I have used it for a few days now, and am very happy to report that the results are very good.I loved:-18x zoom lens-quickly locking auto focus-robust selection of pre-built modes (which is how my wife will use it)-the ability to go into manual everything (which is where I will likely be living)-accurate color capture in outdoor daylight settings and the ability to do manual white balance in other lighting just in case the presets are off-usage of cheap AA cells and support for vanilla SDHC cards-bright and big 3\" LCD and an electronic viewfinder when the light was too bright to use the LCD  (this is where the other manufacturers have cut features)I did not particularly like:-only two aperture settings to select from-results at high ISO settings were too noisy to be very useful-lens cap was not threaded preventing attaching any filters or accessories-only the basic manual in the box, when the full manual would have cost pennies more to include insteadI haven't tried using it for video shooting yet, but it's a good ability to have in a pinch to take some clips. The price is what sold me as well, as this model provided features that were much more in line with other bridge cameras that sold for more money.  I also seriously looked at some entry level DSLR models, but could not justify the fact that I would have had to spend at least twice as much, to just get started down that path.  This one versatile camera should serve us quite well compared to the alternatives during our family vacations.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT BUY", "Author": "Robert A. Tucker", "ReviewID": "R1C5I4EUXEYGKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mostly bought this camera for the 18x zoom feature; the most zoom for the money I found and though I never owned a fuji camera, I figured the Fuji was at least a pretty good camera. Was I ever shocked at the features it has for the price. I does everything and does it well. It had a ton of features and looked complicated to use at first but is one of the easiest cameras to set up and use that I've had. Just have to learn a few buttons to use it. The design of everything on the camera in ingenious, everything is exactly where it should be, easy to reach while using and feels like a real camera, not a toy. This model has a red light beam to target the subject when shooting in dark or low light situations; this can mean the difference in getting a good photo in a dark room when there is not enough light to see the subject in the display. You don't have to look at the display, press the shutter button all the way down and release, put the red beam on the subject and the camera will do the rest without you having to look at the display at all. It will give you enough time to line up your shot before taking the photo. I've gotten many more good pics using this.  The only negatives I found about the camera is that the lens cap ocasionally falls off and the strapis a little on the cheap side; it got so twisted up I removed it. The camera itself overcomes the complaint here and a replacement strap is cheap.  The camera is good enough to use professionally, within it's abilities, and there is no way to  beat this one for the price; it has many features of cameras costing much more. If I were a pro needing to use the high priced cameras they use, this Fuji would be my backup.

This camera exceeds my expectations.  The picture quality is excellent.  The camera focuses quickly and provides more zoom than you will ever reasonably need.  The video quality is also excellent and you can switch modes from pictures to video with  just a few clicks of the control dial.  The camera is not a dslr but the picture quality is on par with 90% of what you get from a dslr.  Most people don't need a dslr they have just been convinced that they do.The camera is not a substitute for a video camera.  But if you need to take one device that can shoot excellent pictures and decent video - this is a great choice.  I used the camera last week to video a children's program at my church.  We showed the video Sunday on our 20 foot projection screen.  The video and sound were great.If I were a professional photographer I of course would not use this camera for my professional work.  This camera is excellent at what it is designed to be.  It is a great all around camera and video camera.  The battery life is also great.  I have been using the same set for the last week, with no indications of a low battery.  I highly recommend the camera.  OK - the lens cap is not very good - it just falls off.

The camera has worked great so far and I've had it for about 3 weeks. I use it almost everyday.This is not a typical point and shoot. You may have to do some of the work yourself, and learning how to get the auto focus to work is key. (It is simple, just a half press of the shutter and it will focus). This camera gives you more control but you just have to learn to use it. If you are not willing to learn, the auto features still work very well.

It takes great pics, is very intuitive to use (I have yet to open the manual and I've had the camera for a few weeks now), and has many great features.My only two complaints are that, one, sometimes it takes a little work to get the lighting and focus just right on the object you are trying to capture. And two, the zoom motor makes a pretty loud, course sounding noise that shows up clear as day in a video when being used. It's loud enough to drown out people talking to the person operating the camera.That being said, I love the 18X zoom lens. It is awesome. And I love the overall look, feel, and size of the thing.I'm by no means a pro photographer, I just like to take pictures now and again. For someone like me, this camera is perfect.

You would be hard pressed to find a camera of this quality with the features it has in any other camera especially for the price. I looked at many reviews and feedbacks and there was very little negative commentary on it. The lens cap does not stay on well but if you forget to take it off when you turn the camera on, it comes off itself which has already saved some pictures for me. We just got back from vacation and took about 700 pictures with it. Just let the camera choose the setting and you will be impressed.

I bought this for a photography class and its fine for it. Would be a good camera if you wanted it for personal use, for taking family photos and what not. My only huge problem with it is that there is no manual focus and it has a hard time focusing in low light situations. The flash is fine but the photos get blown out really easily in really dark situations. Honestly, you get what you pay for with this camera.

A couple seconds will gobble up over 100 MB easily. Sound is oftentimes painful since it has only one mic and no wind cancellation, and the picture is usually completely grainy- In even somewhat dim lighting, pics turn out grainy, blurred, or bothI'm most disappointed with the video capture, it's almost entirely unusable due to both the abhorrent quality and the amount of space it uses (Motion-JPEG as a codec belongs in the 20th century), but the majority of my pictures give satisfy my quality standards.

The 2550 masters the low light as long as it isn't almost completely dark outside. The flash makes the pictures look cheesy and cellphone camera like but as I said, low light function in manual is good.Of course in daylight the 2550 does very good. The CCD image quality is actually in many ways better than my CMOS HS20exr (also a fujifilm). The build quality of the 2550 is great and is relatively water-resistant.Example: when I take pictures of waterfalls where the water vapor and condensation are horrific, the camera hasn't died yet. Sometimes the water is so thick it completely covers the lens. I don't recommend doing this to your 2550 because you might not be as lucky as I was.The zoom feature is very useful and allows me to take picture from a long distance. The only downfall is the fact that 18x plus the digital zoom is not enough to reach some objects that you can still see. This has happened to me before and is extremely annoying. That is one of the many reasons why I have upgraded to the HS20exr, with almost double the zoom, I usually don't use all 720 millimeters of the focal length but when I do I feel happy that I have it. Another thing about the zoom feature is the fact it has a very noisy motor. When you are taking video it is quieter but the zoom still makes a buzzing sound when you zoom the video in. You can hear it in playback as a loud buzzing, over all of the static in the bad mono microphone. I rarely use the video function in the s2550 for that reason. It's 720p HD but nothing more.The only other complaint I have is the fact that the camera is slow, especially compared to the HS20exr. It has missed moments before because it's so slow turning on, autofocusing, and taking pictures. 6 seconds to turn on, autofocus, and take picture. If you want a picture of a bird the 2550 will allow it to fly away, reach the next state, and have babies.Over all though my 2550 is satisfactory and since it isn't my primary camera any more I don't get as annoyed with it's downfalls.

Diamond \"book addict\"", "ReviewID": "R15RE443L059S3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While the features on the Fujifilm Finepix S2550 look impressive, the camera is in many ways an unsatisfactory piece of equipment because of shortcomings in design and quality. To build a bridge camera with 18X optical zoom, HD video capability, a large LCD screen plus viewfinder, yet sell for less than $250, (the list price, but considerably less on Amazon) Fujifilm had to cut a few corners. The first cost savings was to rely on user supplied 4 AA batteries (the camera comes with 4 alkaline  batteries). That adds bulk and weight to the camera but saves Fujifilm the cost of a lithium battery and charger. Users have complained about the flimsy lens cover. The way the zoom lens is designed it cannot take a sturdy lens cover or even a filter for protection. The lens is recessed within a front cylinder or barrel. When the camera is turned on the lens moves out of the cylinder and pushes anything in front out of its away, such as the lens cover. The lens cover is a cheesy piece of flexible plastic, which barely stays put when the camera is not in use. A filter or a more secure, lens cover could damage the lens as it moves out when the camera is turned on. This inconvenient type of lens design for this large zoom only makes sense because it probably saves Fujifilms something in manufacturing costs. The CD has two pieces of software, one of which Fuji has not been bothered to upgrade to Windows 7. Other cost savings have to do with the potential durability of camera parts, as they do not always have a quality feel or show an attention to detail. For example, the battery cover has to hold down 4 relatively large batteries compared to a lithium one, but it doesn't seem to have the heft to last and keep doing the job over the life of the camera. The cover for the cable inputs is even more flimsy: it doesn't have a full hinge holding it to the camera when opened, but only a sliver of plastic. The camera takes an HDMI cable for transferring video to a TV, but you need to find a compatible one on your own. Finally. don't be seduced by the camera specs. The LCD screen is OK, but not the sharpest of brightest. The viewfinder is hard to use in low light. The 18X zoom loses resolution, aperture and stability as you get closer to its upper limits.  The biggest selling point for this camera is its street price. It now sells on Amazon for less than $190, a sharp reduction since it was first introduced some months ago. If you want a bridge camera with better design and quality, look at the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35. But it costs about $100 more than the S2550.

I was sorely disappointed in in how quickly the auto shut-off engaged and how slowly the camera responded to \"on.\"  It was also slow to focus and frequently re-focused when there was no need causing me to lose shots.  Also, you have to hit the the shutter button to turn off playback mode rather than just hitting the playback button again.  It's just awkward.  The panorama feature was kind of fun, though I would have preferred the automatic panorama rather than having to take and line up 3 pictures.  That gets difficult to do especially with all the icons in the way.  I couldn't find a way to get rid of the icons.

You could barely hear any music for all the roaring static.  I was unaware of this because I did not plan on clearing the camera until after my oldest son's junior college game the next night.  It was bad enough that the sound was messed up on the first videos, but the videos I took at the next game had no sound at all!

My next beef is with the video.  If you use the HD setting, you had better have a very large SD card because a two minute clip will eat up about 800Mb.  But the worst part of the video is with the sound quality...it SUX!  If the volume recorded is at a normal level, the microphone \"barely\" picks it up and you have to strain to hear it.

Its images on the \"fine\" (12 MP) setting are extremely crisp, clear and suitable for enlarging into posters while retaining crispness.

Its images are very blurry and do not compare to the 10 MP Panasonic DMC-TZ5 Lumix I bought to overcome my tremor problem.  That little Lumix is actually capable of producing nearly sharp, clear pictures, but has shutter lag and doesn't give as detailed images as my old Fuji FinePix.  This Fuji FinePix S2550 12 MP seems like it would have been good in that it has the ability to manually set aperature and shutter speed, and have no shutter lag, unlike the Lumix, and that's why I wanted it.  But I couldn't believe how horrible the resolution is!  My Fuji S7000, combined with my occasional fine tremor, shoots comparably extremely clear, sharp images, unlike this new Fuji model.If Fuji's new technology has become so unreliable, as I've read negative reviews on its cousin, the 1800, which is essentially the same camera w/out HDMI output, I am no longer confident in Fuji's ability to come out with reliably superior cameras I had come to love in the past.
