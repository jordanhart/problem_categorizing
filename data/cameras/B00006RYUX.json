There also some 4MP cameras that are cheaper or in the same price range of the Xi, but they are bulkier, besides for the common user as myself 3MP image quality is more than enough.It has the fastest startup in its class (1.2 Seconds); and the menus as well as the instruction manuals are simple and friendly.The Dimage Xi has a lot of functions only available on bigger cameras like: 3X Optical Zoom + 4X Digital Zoom, Different ISO settings, Focus lock, Single photo, Continuous capture, Movie and Audio recording, Different flash modes, Exposure compensation, White balance and several combinations of image quality and sizes.The mini battery charges in about two hours and so far has given me a full day of shotswhile using the LCD and without the need of recharge.Its \"periscope type\" optical zoom is really unique and  the image quality is amazing.Finally I may add that this camera is a great eye catcher, everybody seems to like it!The only complain I have is the almost useless PC software that comes with the camera.After a month of heavy use I will DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this camera.", "Date": "December 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "C.

It's so light and compact, it's hard to believe you've got a 3.2 megapixel camera with 12x combined zoom in your hands!The camera uploaded/connected to Windows 2000 via USB with absolutely NO problems, and I had no trouble AT ALL at removing either the memory card OR the battery.  Wish it could take standard AA or AAA batteries, but that's the tradeoff you make for a tiny package.Also, I'm astounded with the extra features this camera offers:  record short movies WITH sound, record voice messages/memos to yourself, tiny moving lens cover, internal zoom parts, FAST startup and shutdown, just to name a few.  Wow.Even the manual is easy to follow and written in plain english.  I didn't try any of the enclosed photo software because Paint Shop Pro 7 is the best and easiest photo and paint software I've ever found. .The camera also has several levels of quality.  With my 128mb memory card, it can store 13 pictures on highest quality and picture size, and 1958 pictures on the lowest quality and smallest picture size.  On medium settings, you'd get at least 391 pictures at a time.  Not too shabby!I'd recommend buying an extra battery pack so you won't worry about running out of power, although the batteries do last a long time if you aren't using the LCD display much.All in all, this camera is worth the money you pay for it.", "Date": "December 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "The improved manifestation of the dimage X", "Author": "Ashegam", "ReviewID": "R25JQAXHZ8N6BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DiMAGE Xi is the upgrade of the popular Dimage X and is identical in physical appearance. It employs the same f/2.8 \"folded\" 3X optical 37-111mm (35mm equivalent) zoom lens.  The main upgrade is the CCD imager which went from 1.96 to 3.2 megapixel and now yields up to 2048 x 1536 pixel images. Other enhancements include user-selectable ISO settings, optional date imprinting, spot autofocus, an improved anti-reflective LCD and automatic e-mail file copy creation.The contrast and color issues of the DiMAGE X have been remedied and I was quite impressed with the image quality. Even heavily backlit subjects were metered and rendered well which is quite a feat for a micro-size 3x zoom digicam.The 1.5 inch LCD is somewhat improved for outdoor use with the new less-reflective covering. I still found myself cupping a hand around the LCD to make it easier to see in bright light. When not using the LCD as a live viewfinder, the eye-level optical viewfinder makes it easy to compose the picture in daylight and by not using the power consuming LCD, battery life is extended.The DiMAGE X required 6 button presses to delete an image during playback as it had to be done from the menu. The DiMAGE Xi now lets you delete an image by simply pressing the flash mode/delete button on the back.It's a bit pricy as was the dimage x, but by far this camera is one the smallerst out there, fastest, and picture quality is much improved.  They pretty much fixed all the flaws of the x an made this camera 10 folds better.

Very portable, good for traveling.Movie - 35 seconds movie in QuickTime format.  Pretty good quality WITH SOUND!!  Can zoom while shooting movie.Functionalities - You can choose TIFF or JPEG format.  35 sec. audio memos for each picture and 30 mins audio recording.  Different ISO settings, night time photo exposure compensation, can zoom-in when viewing pictures on the LCD, e-mail format, EXIF photo printer formatZoom - 3x optical zoom using built-in prism.  No protruding lens during zoom.  Awesome!Memories - comes with 16MB but not enough.  So, I got the 128Mb which is more than enough for my use.  About 130 high quality 4x6\" type of photo (not the largest size and highest quality yet).Battery - small and last for a whole day at least.  I used the Olympus before and its AAA battery runs out so quickly.  This Lithium battery in the Minolta is so much better.Cons:Software - Slow to load up pics and kinda useless.  But I used Photoshop for editing and ACDSee for viewing anyway.Moive - on 35sec Max even if you have a 128M memory card.Conclusions:Cons is minimal.  It's definitely worth it.  Very eye-catching, easy to use, easy to upload pics.  Definitely need a 128Mb memory card, an extra battery.", "Date": "March 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera", "Author": "Harry Wirth", "ReviewID": "R3EAIBGNKM7Z5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 3 months and it really is amazing. I bought it to take on a trip to Scotland so I would always have a camera handy and it fit my needs perfectly. Not only is this camera tiny but the shape is superior as well and it really truly does fit in even small pockets and is comfortable enough that you have to make sure you don't forget about it and sit on it. On the trip we also brought along a full sized 35mm SLR and between me and my wife we took nearly 500 pictures, mostly on the Minolta (with 2 128 meg SD cards) and when we got back we selected the pictures we wanted printed, burned them on a CD and had them processed just like regular film. After we put all of the pictures together in a photo album documenting the trip it was nearly impossible to tell which pictures were taken with the SLR and which were taken with the digital Minolta. For the most part this tiny camer held it's own against a much larger 35mm SLR and the 2.11 megapixel resolution is even enough to print great looking pictures up to 8x10. The camera has few shortcoming and they appear to be a result of the cameras small size. The only concerns I have are as follows:- The flash element is tiny and really only works up close. Low light situations can give this camera some trouble.- The LCD can be pretty dark in low light situations but the camera does have an optical viewfinder that I find I use quite a bit.- Even thought the proprietary battery for this camera is very small batter life is good but I would definitely recommend buying a second battery if you want to go on any serious photo excursions.- The provided 8 meg SD card is a joke, buy at least a 128 meg card, you wont regret it.Bottom line: this camera rocks and I don't understand why it's not getting more attention than it is. It's design is really unique and extremely functional and the picture quality is awesome and all this at a very competitive price.", "Date": "December 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ZA2J8OUH93B6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

First of all it is so slim that fits right into your shirt pocket.  You can take pictures anytime, anywhere.Second, with 3MP  this camera has an exellent resolution , very crisp and natural photos.  You can see every single detail in the images you capture.  The internal lenses with  3x optical zoom is another feature that makes this camera unique.  The LCD Panel has antiglare protection so you can use this camera in any light source condition.  The voice memo and short movie functions are nice features that give a PLUS to the camera.  There are also some Manual Settings in the menu so that you can have more control in your photos quality.

It may look like one of those compact point-and-click thingies, which it of course is, but this is not something pros would easily scoff at, its advanced manual controls are fabulous.WHATS GOOD:(1) Very, very easy to use, no unscrewing lens covers etc. Buttons are super-simple and intuitive to use without a manual(2) A [good looking] autofocus system, surprises even in dim lighting. When you depress the shutter-release button halfway in auto-recording mode, the camera's \"Area AF\" technology evaluates the scene that you're shooting and locks the focus on your subject, even if it's off-center(3) Extensive manual functions for control [people](4) Fast performance, clicks instantly unlike even some of the bigger cams(5) Needless to mention, sleek, pocket-sized design(6) Apart from the manual white balance (also found in other cameras in this class) there's a WB Custom Recall feature that saves and recalls your last manual setting(7) Captures video clips with sound. Built-in microphone and speaker allow you to capture and play back video clips of up to about 35 seconds in length(8) Can make copies of your pictures in-camera(9) Good battery life out of the CR-3V photo-lithium cellsCAVEATS:(1) No rechargeable battery included although your mileage may vary(2) Ships with only a 16MB memory card (easily fixed)(3) LCD somewhat smaller than other competitors, e.g., Nikon 2500 or Canon's S40(4) Doesn't support external flash or lens converters (a mildly major pain in my book but may not matter to everyone)(5) Automatic white balance may sometimes produce a bluish cast especially in bright light(6) Can use SD card or MMC card, but MMC card is noticeably slower(7) Somewhat high price?SUMMARY:I am generally a Canon fan for prosumer cameras, but Canon's small offerings are not all that neat. Canon S... (replace ... with model number) have a better LCD screen, slightly faster photo review scrolling, and slightly nicer overall build quality. BUT, Dimage has half the startup time, 3x optical zoom versus Canon's, capability for saving in TIFF formats (high quality images), a minimum focal length much closer than Canon's, and all internalized moving parts.If you want a sleek, small, yet very functional camera Minolta is one of my top recommendations.", "Date": "August 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best Little Camera", "Author": "T-Roy", "ReviewID": "R25QUSJBMIALKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a full size 5+ megapixel, 10x zoom digital camera as well as this one, but when I'm on the go, this is the camera of choice.

I was low on money, and found this camera refurbished.  I read lots of reviews and compared this camera to other cameras with the same features.  Buying this camera is definitely not a mistake!  I have the basic case and an extra battery, and since the batteries only take about an hour and a half to charge I always have one ready when the battery in the camera dies (Which is usually after a full day of continuous photography).  The camera is incredible rugged, I have dropped it on more than one occasion, and it still works.  Whether I am in school, at home, or pretty much anywhere, this I know that I am sure to get a good picture.  Now to adress some of the problems that people say this camera has:1.  anemic flash - Although the flash is a little wimpy, when you use it within about 12 feet of your subject it is fine.2.  picture quality - the picture quality is as good as any 3.2 megapixel camera.  It just depends what setting you have it on.  I always keep mine of the largest picture and fine quality(next level below tiff).  If you are complaining about image quality, get a film camera, and wait until digital cameras get better.  Film is the equivalent of about 15-20 megapixels.3.  16 megabyte card - duh, you can't get many pictures on here that are even somewhat decent in quality.  No matter what camera you buy, you will still have to buy a larger card if you want a good amount of pictures.  I have a 256 megabyte card that holds 160 pictures on fine and about 38 in tiff mode.4.  Finger in the picture - yeah, I agree that if you have big hands this can become a problem.  The best way to hold this camera, is to use the controls and take the picture with your right hand and hold the bottom left hand corner of the camera with your left hand to steady it.5.  this camera is not for professionals - I agree.  If you want all the controls of a manually controlled camera, keep looking, however, the autofocus does do a nice job, and I don't understand why a camera with more things to adjust would be better for snapshots and and active lifestyle.All in all, this camera is truly one of the most handy electronic gadgets that I can think of and I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE.", "Date": "March 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Incredible Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9TP36RUA5YO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the camera a few days ago, I am not new to digital photography,but this little camera, its in a class by itself, diminutive, powerful, it can produce prints that any lab anywhere cannot equal, fast handling, focusing is about the best I,ve seen on any digital camera, it does it with no light assist.Even the battery does well, recharges quickly.I print on an Epson 825, which can print at 5750, thats great, but the camera cant do that, yet, the print quality it just magnificent, its small, its quick, even the flash seems to be more powerful than other digitals twice its size, menus are very easy to navigate, instruction manual is excellentIt really is difficult to fault this little digital camera that fits in your pocket and works so well,lots of applause to Minolta, great job, if your want to buy a digital camera, look at this one, I love the thing.", "Date": "March 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Mary E.

However, you will use it the most for two reasons.  It is small enough to take in a shirt pocket or purse.  The main feature is \"audio notation\" which records 15 seconds of audio after each picture.  When, you return from a trip, you don't have to try to remember what city or landmark you visited.  In a few mouse clicks, you can create a slide show with your own voice describing the sites.  Very few cameras have this feature, and some who have it don't know how to use it, but it is a great general purpose camera.

About 2+ years ago, I purchased a Sony DSC-F505V (which is a nice digital camera - read the reviews here on Amazon).  The problem is that it is a rather bulky camera and my wife refused to use it because it was too difficult to carry while trying to keep up with our two young children.  She resorted to going back to her old film based point-and-shoot camera because of its smaller, more portable size.  The DiMAGE Xi has now completely coverted her over to digital photography.  We have found that the DiMAGE Xi is definitely a take anywhere camera.  What is most impressive is that the DiMAGE packs nearly the same, key everyday user features as my Sony F505V but in the form factor that is only a bit larger than a tin of Altoids!Recommend getting a backup battery and upgrade the SD memory to at least 256Mb - expect this to add around $... to the overall price.Pros:  Extremely small form factor, 3x optical zoom for such a small form factor and no protruding lenses, fairly intuitive menu (particularly if you are already somewhat familiar with digital cameras), has both a viewfinder AND LCD display.Cons:  Flash is a bit limited, body of camera does tend to get a bit warm (dissipates a bit of power) when LCD display is being used, only comes with 16Mb SD memory card", "Date": "August 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great value.  I am very pleased!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R13VCAERI13G9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am confident I made the best choice but I nearly lost six weeks' work on a trip --700 photos-- when a 128 MB Sandisk SD disk crashed.  (I was ultimately, inexplicably able to recover the photos when I got home after failed attempts abroad.) The troublesome disk was the same brand and model as the 8 MB disk that comes with the camera, only larger capacity.  After that I found places to periodically save photos on CD for backup; Internet cafes with this capability are increasingly common, and it's cheap to do.  The disk was at fault, not the camera. As the manual says (and which I failed to do), format the disk with the camera before use.0)  You will definitely need a spare battery!  Buy only the SD (Secure Digital) type cards because they are faster than the so-called \"Multimedia\" cards.1)  This camera is so tiny that I found a fabric Tamrac case for it about the size of a fat wallet that also held my spare battery and disks.  I was able to wear on my belt and had it with me nearly all the time, which has been great on trips because I could snap a photo any time.2)  There is not enough flash to reach beyond six feet or so, and no hot shoe to connect a bigger flash.  If the notion of a hot shoe seems ridiculous for such a tiny camera, I assure you that it would not be inconsistent with the high level of features this camera provides.  The different flash modes allow one to command whether the flash goes off or not, or one can leave it up to the computer.  But one cannot choose *how much power* to use for the flash.3)  The lens is in a corner of the camera and it takes a long time (mark my words) before one learns to keep fingers and nose out of the way.  It is also a problem when asking strangers to snap a photo of you, because they usually touch the lens and smudge it.  (There isn't always a satisfactory place to set the camera down to make a self-portrait with the timer.)  Once I was trying to explain to someone who didn't speak English to not touch the lens, and she thought I was saying to press the lens to take a picture and that's what she did!  8-[]4) The viewfinder is nice when there's too much sunlight to see the display on the back of the camera. The view changes as one zooms in and out, as on an SLR camera, but be aware that the actual image includes a slightly more than one sees through the viewfinder.  That's better than the opposite, so at least it errs toward caution.  What you see on the LCD display is what you get.5) It comes with a USB cable to connect to a computer, and another to connect to the TV so you can view images there.6) You needn't take any software with you to e-mail photos while on a trip!  The camera just shows up as a removable disk on Windows 2000, Me, or XP.  If the Internet cafe you pick has only Windows 98 (now rare), you must get a driver from somewhere.  Most cafes will be more willing to let you connect to one of their computers if you can convey that you are not going to install any software.  The Image Viewer Utility software that comes with the camera is for rotating images and touching them up (lightening, hue, color correction, etc.) and I thought it was reasonably easy to use.  It's handy for both viewing and touching up a lot of photos fast, and has very few annoyances.7)  I found the controls easy to learn, the manual good, and I am very happy with the quality of the photographs.  My friends have been impressed; two comments I've gotten were that they look like National Geographic photos (blush, blush) and \"Did you take that with your little camera?!\"  --but note that I've studied photography since I was a teenager.8)  It takes seven (7) clicks to delete a photo!  That's a lot if you're throwing out several photos.9)  It makes movies with sound that one can watch on a computer, or on TV with the TV cable.", "Date": "March 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Went through the wash", "Author": "Meg", "ReviewID": "R1C4GME0FM5A9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.
