{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "lil rae", "ReviewID": "R3KC7RJUWI8ZTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for personal use after using an expensive professional HP at work for years. I love the brand and HP is true to its reputation for quality. Even to the low 2MP the image quality is good. The only drawback was taking pictures at night. However, I found that if you play around with the settings, you can still get very good shots at night time. The built-in desgin gallery borders option is a bit over-rated, but the crop, red-eye removal features are great. Overall, I feel this camera is an excellent buy for the money!", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "HP Digital Camer", "Author": "Casey Gisclair \"Casey L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2XJUPR04R6LT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product.

I had a few requirements: No moving lens (seen too many with dirt-jammed mechanisms), Charge from mini-USB (like my cell phone; I have chargers in my cars, at home, at work) good viewfinder, and use large SD cards.  This one wins on all counts.  I've taken over a thousand pics and 30+ minutes of video now.  I was not too sure how the viewfinder screen would work, but it is bright enough to use outside in sunlight.  I haven't run out of power yet.  I like the way switching from optical to digital zoom works:  When you press the button, it zooms (by steps) to max optical zoom, then you need to take your finger off the button and press it again for digital zoom.  Since I rarely want to use digital zoom this is a nice feature for me.  Get one while you can!", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love the camera but this seller is on drugs.", "Author": "Shellshock", "ReviewID": "R2XJ5JBSEJ8MC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wore out my first one after umpteen years.Really disappointed that HP quit making them.This guy wants $150 for his and it comes with nothing.Purchased second one at a reasonable price from another seller via Amazon for $35 and it included two extra batteries and the car charger and in home recharger.  Unfortunately, I broke it soon after, changing batteries in a rush, by not noticing the  cover over the battery/memory disc hadn't completely latched. The loose cover allowed the little retainer for the battery to break.Just received the third one via E-bay, for $38.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "gramabikki", "Author": "gramabikki", "ReviewID": "R4AJOA7NACT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for quite some time and it still works. The only part of the camera that is not perfect is the slide on the back that turns the camera on. I am now having some trouble and have to slide it more than once sometimes to get it to turn on. The camera itself is a very good camera. HP is a good brand. I have been very pleased with this product.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP Digital Camera", "Author": "Shari T.

I'm not qualified at this time to give a complete review, as I've yet to print out pictures or download onto my computer.  I plan on doing that soon. I think the image quality is good and I like its image- enhancing features.  As a first time owner, I believe digital cameras definitely have their own niche; however, I'm beginning to realize film cameras should never become obsolete; I believe, in the end, they produce better quality pictures. I imagine, too, in the final analysis, price plays a big role. I am happy with the camera and have no regrets about purchasing it.  In fact, I'm having a great time filling up my memory card with images of my avacado tree in bloom (pretty good for living in a temperate climate), and my flower and berry gardens as they grow.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7-megapixel CCD for crisp pictures up to poster size\n3-inch LCD screen with viewing angle up to 170 degrees\n3x optical zoom; up to 24x total zoom\nIn-camera red-eye removal; panoramic photo feature\n16MB internal memory; capture pics to SD memory cards", "Name": "HP Photosmart R837 7MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AKE0ve2dL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000N23XGS"}}
