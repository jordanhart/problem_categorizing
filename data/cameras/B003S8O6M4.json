I think the EP2 is aimed at SLR users, while the EPL2 is aimed at point and shoot users. The design is retro and well built, the metal is very high quality. The moment I took it out of the box I was in awe, it looks really nice. Images are sharp and as expected for the 4/3 sensor. The 17mm is so awesome and versatile, but you have to make sure that you update the firmware. This will improve your focusing by about 10-15%! Overall, this is a great package! I also got the VF3 to complete my operation. I am happy with this purchase. Olympus has a beautiful color profile, and this has a rangefinder experience with the 17mm, quite liberating to use apart from my 5DmkII.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "E-P2", "Author": "JP", "ReviewID": "RN4VN76HA4X40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great fun camera.
