{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fuji Rocks!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2DO3KTK9CD241", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching...for various digital cameras..., I decided to go for this fuji finepix 2300. While your excitement will certainly vary according to the price you pay, I reccommend it highly! The size is small enough to fit into one of my tiny purses and yet offers all the accomodations I was looking for:-built-in flash-variable resolution (great quality photos)-red-eye reduction-self-timer-nice aesthetics-lcd view-usb download port (very fast)-some memory included (only 8 mb but good for backup)-accepts rechargeable AA NIMH batteries -clear up close and distance photos-good color-snap and shoot capabilitiesNow let me elaborate on the pros and cons...The only real draw backs to this camera remain 1)the somewhat exposed lens and lack of available lens cap and 2)that a zoom lens is not included. One may remedy these slights by simply taking care to protect the lens and adjusting one's distance to the subject accordingly...Other than that, the camera rocks! I've had great photos and none of the problems I've read reviewers have with other cameras. I'm able to take approximately 40 highest resolution images on a 32 mb card and many, many more on lower resolution which is still pretty clear. The set up is easy...all you do is install the software from a cd-rom, turn on the camera, plug in the usb cord, choose the location where you want the pics on your hard drive using the software (very simple), and the images download in a few seconds (of course it'll take longer if you have a larger memory card and more stored images). It comes with Photo Deluxe so you can alter images if you like (brightness/contrast or size, etc). One of the greatest features of this camera is that it takes rechargeable NIMH (better for the environment, bank account, and busy schedules) AA batteries. I've read about other digital cameras tearing through batteries, but I haven't had this problem--my rechargeable NIMH batteries made it through a couple of weeks. You also have the option of turning off the lcd view to save energy. What's more, some cameras require that you use the manufacturers battery, which is a problem if you need to recharge in the rainforest. With this camera, you can just pop in some new AA batteries (4) and continue with your photo spree. The continuous photo option is fun--it takes up to 9 photos and can be put on self-timer.The close up option works great--I tested it with some tropical flowers and natural light. If you don't have a good printer or want to blow-up shots, you can send the photos to a printer.All my friends and family have been highly impressed with the quality of the photos I've emailed them, and it makes for great fun at a party since you can see all the pics immediately!...and delete the one of yourself with your eyes closed...", "Date": "September 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "A Bargain for the  Price", "Author": "Brad P. Gurgel", "ReviewID": "R2K20SH20YLM02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few days ago expecting to get what I payed for, a 2.1 mega pixel, mid-range digital camera.  As far as picture quality it has surpassed the quality I thought I was getting.  As long as you use the Normal or Fine quality picture modes in the 1600x1200 resolution the prints of the pictures were almost as clear as a non digital camera.  In fact if I would have printed it on glossy photo paper, I probably would not have been able to tell much of a difference between that print out and a non digital camera's print out.  I even printed some pictures the size of a whole page and it was still pretty good quality.  This camera is simple to use, by the end of the first day I knew how to use almost all the features of the camera.  Every camera has its downsides, however, and this camera is no exception.  One downside is that the viewfinder is right above the LCD screen.  This makes it hard to look through the viewfinder without putting a smudge on the LCD screen.  Another small complaint I had was that the camera lens appears to be very vulnerable to scratches since it isn't protected very well by the rest of the camera.  As long as you keep it in a nice case and handle it with care you should have no problem with the lens though, and you can use the LCD screen to take pictures without ever using the viewfinder.  This camera can be set to automatic mode where the camera decides the type of flash, white mode, and brightness for you, or as you become advanced with digital cameras you can set the camera to manual mode and make all the choices for yourself.  This allows your camera to grow with you.  I mainly use the auto mode, since the camera does a pretty good job of adjusting the flash and other features on its own.  This camera usually comes with a 8 MB smart media card for storing the pictures in the camera.  This card can hold only 10 pictures in the camera's fine 1600x1200 mode.  (the best camera mode) It can, however, hold 19 pictures in the normal mode, which I have found to be a good mode for most pictures.  This is not a lot of pictures so I would advise purchasing at least one more 8 MG card, or even a 16 MG card. (the 16 MG card can hold 20 pictures in the best mode and 39 in the normal mode)  These cards are very easily taken in and out of the camera, and the camera comes with a USB cable to easily transfer pictures from the camera to the computer when the smart media card is in the camera.  This saves you from having to purchase expensive smart media card readers, which adds to the bargain of buying this camera.  Make sure you have a USB port on your computer to be sure you can use this cable. In conclusion this camera is a bargain for a 2 mega pixel camera, and takes very high quality pictures. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera under ... who still wants good quality photos.", "Date": "June 28, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good value & functions for a 2.1 mega pix digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RL39QP052ZPPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera about a month back when it just got released. Actually I was intending to get the 1300 model but decided to pay a little more and get the newer 2300 model. I've compared with all other cameras around and must say this is one of the best deal you can get. It is very small, light & compact, fits easily into a coat pocket. The 4 AA batteries that it uses lasts a long time and with functions like self-timer, 5 modes of flash, red eye reduction, tripod mountable, macro mode, digital 2x zoom, USB connections. Pictures taken during the day are very clear & good, for night shorts or where places are dark, a steady hand is required. The only few disadvantages that I can think of is the camera lens can be scratch easily. (If you look at the picture of the camera you'll know what I mean). The other is if you gripped the camera tightly with your hand you can feel some kind of plastic sound, as if the body of the camera is not tightly screwed. The camera doesn't come with a case, so it's advisable to get one, especially with its unprotected lens. All in all, I'll give a all thumbs up for this model, Fuji Finepix 2300!", "Date": "May 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": "\"fatcatx\"", "ReviewID": "R1SEERFUZQZVPL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I am happy with the quality and ease of use with this camera.  Features are easy to learn/use.  Quality of most pictures is very good.  USB cable makes downloading a breeze.  I am looking at my pictures in 30 seconds. I also like the wide range of print quality you can chose from which offers flexibility.  The 8MB card included is not bad for just starting out.  If you only want pics to email or show on a computer screen, you can fit quite a lot on this little card.  If you want print quality though, pick up a 32 or 64MB card and save yourself the hassle.Negatives:  I got this camera because it has a macro lens (close ups) - a feature hard to find on an inexpensive camera.  While the macro feature produces OK close-ups, they are still pretty poor when compared to to macro shots with a traditional camera.  Still good in a pinch though or when you don't need perfection.This camera EATS batteries.  I am not getting even HALF to the number of shots for the battery life according to the manual so I am debating whether the camera is defective. The cost of batteries could quickly offset any savings on film and processing.  I may have to invest in rechargeables.", "Date": "July 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great price for a good camera", "Author": "yarden \"yarden\"", "ReviewID": "R19Z9EOYH3HG3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is inexpensive but still manages to take great pictures. Sure, you could spend a lot more for a camera that is a lot more high-tech, but if you just want a camera to learn on and experiment with or just take fun family snaps, then this camera would be great.My husband actually won a photo contest with a 5x7 photo taken on an older model of this camera (printed on an HP printer). Pros: low cost, easy to use, easy to figure out how to take good photos, takes good enough quality photos to replace your film camera (if you're ready for that... I'm not quite there).Cons: memory card pretty small if you want to take high quality pics (We got a bigger memory card--available on costco.com--so we could take many pictures at high quality settings.), slow upload to your computer using serial cable (we got a SmartMedia drive that hooks up to our USB port and is lightning quick), lower picture quality capability than many (more expensive) cameras on the market, and batteries are used up fairly quickly IF (and only if) you use the display mode to take pictures with (but this isn't necessary at all for good pictures).These days, most digital cameras really aren't that horrible , and this camera is lightyears better than the super-spendy cameras that were out three years ago. This camera would be great for someone who wants a camera for casual use, or for pictures for their website, or even regular pictures that won't be blown up much larger than 5x7. We take pictures with abandon now, not worrying about how much film we have left, not worrying if a shot is going to be a throw-away (you can delete it right on the camera, anyway), and we have gotten some truly beautiful and priceless shots just using this camera. If you're not a professional photographer, why spend thousands when you can get this camera at a great price?", "Date": "December 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "FujiFilm FinePix 2300 -- A Great Value in Digital Cameras", "Author": "Thaddius Mumford \"Shop Saver\"", "ReviewID": "RXWOWO3NOYTM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The FujiFilm FinePix 2300 is an all-around great value if you're looking for a high-resolution, 2.1 megapixel CCD 1600x1200 max digital camera.  The 5.8mm (36mm equivalent) focus is excellent; you get a sharp, detailed image, even in 640x480 low-resolution.  The 2.5X digital zoom is only functional in low-resolution mode (640x480) but this camera takes really nice pictures even in low-resolution.  The 8MB SmartMedia card can store up to 89 images at 640x480.  If you invest in a 128MB SmartMedia card, you can store 1,330 images at 640x480 (or 166 images at 1600x1200 fine resolution).  Overall, it's a really easy-to-use camera.  I took it out on many trips so far and I find it very responsive and able to take sharp pictures on-the-fly, even while in the car moving 80+ miles-per-hour.  The FujiFilm software to upload your images through the camera's USB interface is quick and easy.

Brightness levels can be adjusted after the pictures have been taken. The zoom and panning feature alow images to be cropped for aesthetically better compositions. I am impressed with the quality of the macro photo funtion. Reviewing images on the display makes it easy to delete bad pics. But, I do have one big complaint. The lens quality distorts images. I intended to use this camera to document painted portraits and other artwork, however, the distortion is too significant.  You can spot this by taking a picture of a round plate holding the camera vertically and then again with the camera held horizontally. A distortion can be seen with the round circle appearing slightly elongated one direction and compressed in the other.I will run this test on any future camera I buy and am considering returning the camera even though I am impressed with the ease of its use.", "Date": "June 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Bang for your buck", "Author": "\"amateurphotographer\"", "ReviewID": "RD10SVVN51463", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For it's price, this camera has managed to strike a balance between quality and affordability.  2.11 M pixels is good enough for any amateur, who's not fixated on getting the most pixels possible from today's technologies.  The box comes with every thing that one needs to snap away and load JPG files into the PC.Using the camera is pretty easy and intuitive - although I'm a first time user, it just took me about 5 mins to learn the basic functions.  FinePix 2300 is also relatively smaller and more esthetically pleasing to the eye in comparison with other models of its class.  It's slim and smooth lines fits nicely into the palm of your hands.

The 2300 is an excelent point-and-shot camera, with practically no problems whatsoever. Finepix's software and image downloading is very easy to install and use even to some very old computer models using WIN 98.Even though I have two other more sophisticated digital cameras, I still carry my 2300 everywhere I go, and use it as a side camera. I have never noticed the \"spots\" somebody else complains about, and certainly one thing that I like to stress is that the guys at Fujifilm really did their homework well, since the camera has a great color sensitivity. I have taken lots of colorful pictures in all kind of situations and the only complain I have is that sometimes the flash is too weak if you are shooting outside. This camera is so easy to handle that even children can use it. Even if the lenses are very small, the quality of the images are as good as the more expensive Nikon 775, and certainly the color is far better. It is not heavy at all and the monitor is brigth and sharp. I use mine with two 32 Mb Smartmedia Card and I never get out of memory.I got my camera for a very low price, and certainly, if you do not want all the bells and wistles of more expensive and complicated cameras, try this one.

I no longer need to pay for developing rolls and rolls of films! I'm the type of photographer who would be glad if 5 photos (out of 36) turned out to be ... presentable. Not that I'm THAT bad a photographer but let's say my standards are high.So you can see why buying this camera has been great. I don't have to hide or throw away hundreds of photos, I just delete them on the spot and take it again. The Finepix 2300 has a LCD screen that's big enough to see details and just small enough for the camera to be palm-sized. Even in a slightly dim room without flash, the captured image is still clear and bright. Of course, with the flash, the image looks much better. Another excellent plus point of the camera is the macro function. I took a close-up shot of a flower that my wife planted and she loved the shot! Looks very professionally taken.However, the 8MB memory card supplied with the camera is sadly not sufficient if you want to take pictures in maximum resolution (1600 x 1200). It can only store 19 images of that size. I bought a 32MB memory card and now I can store up to 79 images before transferring them to my laptop. I bought it for about $40 (in Singapore).One problem I have is the appearance of what seems to be mold or dust on the inside of the lens (as I tried real hard to get them off). They only appear when the flash gets thrown back towards you (that is, if the background is made of glass or mirrors). Got to get it clean (it's still under warranty).

Almost immediately, I noticed small, translucent spots on some pictures taken in certain lighting conditions. I looked at the lens under magnification (40x) and saw foreign matter on the inside of the lens. I contacted Fujifilm who told me to send it to them (prepaid of course). I enclosed a note for the technician explaining the problem, however, when the camera was returned 4 weeks later, it was in the same condition as when I sent it in, except the exterior of the camera had been cleaned by the Fujifilm technician. When I called Fujifilm about this, the supervisor told me these spots are a common occurance. He claims the lens is SO good, it will actually \"see\" dust on the exterior of the lens.

This thing is amazing.  It isn't to high tech, nor is it to pricy.  This camera has only 2 drawbacks, and one of those can be fixed.  The first is that although it seems light, once you put in the smartmedia card and the 4 AA batteries it becomes quite heavy.  The other drawback is that if you regular baatteries it will finsh them before you know it.  But that can be fixed easily by buying rechargable batteries.  Other than that this camera is great.

At first we had trouble with the batteries running out too fast, but we bought some better rechargable batteries, and haven't had any problems since. I've had bad experiences with some cheaper digital cameras, that only have 1 pixel. The pictures were came out really blurry on the computer, and werent even worth printing. It's worth the extra money for the 2.1 pixels!!! I take this camera with me everwhere...I highly recomend it!!!", "Date": "October 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "\"______________________-__\"", "ReviewID": "R3GZ5FFH37FMN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It takes great pictures, has an lcd screen, and flash.
