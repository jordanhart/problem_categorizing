It has great \"human factor\" engineering, meaning it fits your hands like a glove and all the controls are easy to access.  The camera/lens combo is very light and easy to handle.  If you have any Minolta lenses, they fit.  The ability to view the picture on the large, bright LCD instead of through the viewfinder is a definite plus in many situations.  14+ megapixels ... really, how many more do you need?Here's the bottom line ... I worked for Kodak, I've been a serious amateur photographer for decades, I've shot thousands of pictures (hundreds so far with this camera) and it leaves nothing that I can think of to be desired.  If you want to spend more bucks on a Nikon or Canon, have fun.  But for my money, this little beauty is a clear winner.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic camera, but a really really crappy lens.", "Author": "Gregory J. Taieb", "ReviewID": "R37TQIEN06N0V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really unbelievable for the price.  If we're talking about the camera body (with no lens), I prefer it over the Canon Rebel XSi anyday (and I've used both).  The problem for Sony is that their lens is sooooo crappy that the image quality goes straight down the toilet, and Canons lenses are for the most part very sharp and colorful.The solution?  Minolta lenses.  I got my camera in the mail this morning and have played with it all day.  From the second I unpacked the lens I was disappointed- even before I put it on the camera.  It has an extremely cheap and plasticy feel, probably because it is cheap and made of only plastic.  I'm actually pretty sure there's not a single piece of glass in the lens (which means, for those of you are new to this, that it sucks).  I put it on and sure enough the results were not pretty.  Don't run off to Canon's page so quickly, though- remember that this IS a 5 star review.What makes up for sony's crappy crappy lens is the fact that you can use any Minolta lens from the past 20 years.  In anticipation of purchasing this camera I brought 2 Minolta lenses from a garage sale a few weeks ago for a hundred bucks, and when I put them on the camera it was like magic.  The autofocus still works in an instant, and the sharpness and color combined with Sony's 14megapixel sensor have left this former film-snob utterly impressed.So my advice to advanced amateur photographers is to buy this camera.  But just the body only.  Save the hundred bucks to buy yourself a Minolta lens (or two).  I thought I'd throw in the extra hundred bucks with this cam just to have an extra lens for my collection, and it was absolutely not worth it.  I don't even know if I'll mount it onto my camera ever again.  Seriously-  It's a big plastic turd.  I wouldn't buy it again if it was 20 bucks.Also-  I learned the complete menu for this camera in less than a day. The only negative things about this camera (except for the crappy turd plastico lens) are that it's not a full frame sensor (look it up, and then decide if you really want to spend and extra 1300 dollars to get a full frame sensor DSLR), and that there's a really dumb and pointless digital zoom button that is a total tragic use of space.  I could think of ten more used/usable functions that could have gone there instead.Really though, I couldn't be happier with this camera.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "First hands on...Great Value DSLR!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R3EWUPIRNU1L3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been able to handle an Alpha 350 one and off for about a month now, and I'm quite pleased with what I've seen so far.First, the camera's appearance is very much like that of the Alpha 200, and identical to the Alpha 300.  All share the same, comfortable grip that uses a full-size lithium-ion \"info\" battery, and should feel good in most peoples hands.  The tilting LCD screen is added from the A200, and makes it a bit thicker at the back.  This thickness doesn't seem to be much of a drawback for handling, but it might make it a bit more ackward for those who wear eyeglasses.Most of the camera controls are located in easy to use places, although the rear toggle might be too easy to hit (by mistake) for some, the idea is for it to be quickly accessable.Performance wise, the camera seems to be greatly improved from the older Alpha 100.  Image Quality (IQ), both sharpness and color wise, appear to be very good.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do critical, side-by-side, low-light/high ISO testing, something which is of a possible concern with such a high megapixel CCD sensor.  Visually, those images I shot in poor lighting appeared reasonably good, but more serious testing needs to be done.Autofocusing speed is very decent, especially when the eye-start feature begins the AF process for you.  The 9-point AF seems fast and accurate.  My only disappointment is that an upgrade camera such as this does not have the \"instant\" manual focusing ability of the Alpha 100.  [This feature allowed you to use the camera in AF.  Once the camera focused, it released the gearing, making manual focusing instantly possible to make corrections, without fiddling for an AF/M switch].Of course, the built-in anti-shake ability is great.  Although we can argue the merits of in-camera vs. in-lens, there is no doubt that this feature is much less expensive, and works with lenses that neither Nikon nor Canon offer with IS/VR (e.g. 50mm f1.4), and a whole bunch of older lenses as well.Like the anti-shake system, everyone will have their opinion on what's the best way to implement Live View.  I prefer the way Sony has chosen to use Live View, where AF speed is unaffected.  The drawback is that only 90 percent of the actual image is previewed with Sony's system.  Adding the articulated, nice quality LCD seems to me to make this system a bit more useful, and the 1.4x and 2x digital cropping may come in handy (but keep in mind, you're just cropping out megapixels).Another feature I would have liked for this price is a wireless shutter release (it does offer a wired release).It will be interesting to see how this stacks up to the competition.  The biggest threat will come from the Canon Digital Rebel XSi.  The XSi will be smaller (using a new, smaller battery), and have a 12 megapixel CMOS sensor, which may prove to be better from someone doing low light with high ISO speeds (such as museum or stage photography).  Also, for $200 less, the Alpha 300 will need serious consideration.  The only feature difference is it has 10 megapixels vs. 14, and this may actually improve IQ in poorer light.Overall, a very fine addition to the Sony lineup!Canon Digital Rebel XSI 12MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Silver)Sony Alpha DSLRA300X 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Super SteadyShot Image Stabilization with DT 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 & DT 55-200mm f/4-5.6 Zoom Lenses", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Camera, great - Lens is just OK", "Author": "E.

The live view and tilting screen is very hand when shooting small objects on the ground.HOWEVER - I'm a bit disappointed in the 18-70mm lens supplied with it. Under certain conditions (which I'm not sure I understand what these are) there is quite a bad flair. Red on the left, green on the right of objects. Bright and contrasty pictures seem to show this up most.When viewing the pictures normally, this defect isn't obvious. When the pictures are enlarged to the extent that you are starting to see the pixels, this flair becomes quite obvious. I'll try to submit a picture here illustrating this. If I'm not successful, trust me that it's poor.The good aspect of this defect is that it's not obvious unless the pictures are enlarged quite a bit, so for most photographers, it's not an issue. Dispite this problem, I like the camera and I'm glad I got it. This amazon price was also good.I bought the Tamron 70-300mm zoom and it works well on this camera and doesn't seem to have this red/green lens flair.

Some additional controls, true TTL viewing, even longer battery life than the A100 - which means I've taken more than 1,000 photos at maximum quality without a battery change - and it handles quickly and accurately. I have a few lenses, but like the flexibility of the Sony 18-200mm zoom so it's on the camera most of the time.  The disadvantage with that lens is that it's slow (4.5 to 6.3 at 200mm) so it's not really suitable for people shots, unless they're in bright sunlight.  However, the lens is fine for objects, buildings or anything that's not going to move quickly.  I was in Marrakech recently and found the camera and lens a great combination, although they're big and obvious enough to make it difficult to shoot candid portraits.

Winkler \"wink2001\"", "ReviewID": "R2B70O61WY5W3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been about 10 years since I put away my old olympus SLR camera away to gather dust for a few nifty small digital point and shoots. I bought this Sony about a month ago and have taken almost 2,000 pics.  Took me a while to brush up on my technique and understand the new dslr lingo, but for anyone who has ever used a traditional SLR, I think you'll be most pleased. SUPER clear/hi res pictures, exceptionally quick focusing, even in live view mode, and easy to access options.  Chances are, the things you are looking for the most are just a button, dial or quick click away.  The ISO button is super handy, and with the touch of a button, you can change the setting up to 3200 to suit your needs.I skipped the kit lens option and decided to buy the SAL18250  (18 mm - 250 mm.  Stick with the Sony lens folks.  It is solid responsive, and a great overall wide angle/telephoto lens.  Why schlep around 2 kit lens' when you can virtually have it all in one?  (:OK back to the camera.  OK now, some cons:  The camera is a bit on the heavy side (But then again I'm really used to a point and shoot).  This camera also lacks the ability to do a super magnified manual focus on the LCD during live view.  This is not a real big deal to me for my needs.  Auto focus works great, and manual focus works fine for me those rare times I use it.I love the tiltable 2.7 in live view screen.  Got some incredible shots at ground level looking up (From a dog's eye view)  I should say an ants eye view!  That with the wide angle... wowza.. seriously creative shots without breaking your back or twisting your neck!I've been able to hand hold existing light shots down to 1/20 of a second, thanks to the anti shake feature.  Pretty cool.  I would have never thought I could take such a slow hand held pic without it being all blurred.I highly recommend purchasing an 8 gig CF card for this camera to maximize your data storage.  You should get about 1,700 fine res .jpg pics per disk.  Go for the faster speed CF card like the SanDisk Extreme III.  They're cheap now, under a hundred bucks.  I also recommend getting a UV filter and circular polarizer.  Again, stick with Sony filters.  Now that you have such a great camera, you'll want the really nice quality filters.You'll have fun with this camera and your friends will drool over your pictures!!!", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "My first DSLR", "Author": "Fred Madison \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R37DVZRUNRZIJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera body a couple of weeks ago together with the Sony Zeiss 16-80mm lens.  It is my first DSLR, with my most recent other camera being a Canon S2 IS superzoom point and shoot.  Have not used a SLR camera since before the digital age.  Am very happy with it!  Image quality, as you'd expect, is *far* above that of the S2 IS... and there aren't any image quality issues that I can determine relative to other DSLRs.  Resolution seems great, color is spot-on, etc.Ergonomically, I'm also very happy.  As I get back into using things like aperture and shutter speed settings, I find the controls to be well laid out and accessible.  The Live View implementation is very easy to use...admittedly, I wish I could live-view things like depth of field et al, but for my uses, I don't really miss it.  My only complaint is that when I hold the camera, occasionally my hand will press up against the AF directional-pad and alter the AF setting.At the moment, I can't really imagining needing anything more complex than this camera.  I'm sure that a pro photographer will want the flexibility of more lenses et al.  But for me, I don't see myself needing a whole collection of lenses...maybe one more bigger zoom lens or something like that.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "My thoughts on the Sony A350", "Author": "Stephen Shewey", "ReviewID": "R3CN8RAEEBMC3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start off, I don't really write reviews on products, and I am new to digital photography, so you can really take this review with a grain of salt... However, I just thought I would share why I gave this product a 5 star rating.The five star rating simply put is because I love this camera. As stated earlier I am new to digital SLR photography so I won't be nearly as insightful as the Nikon/Canon buffs.Why get the A350? 14.2 megapixels. Live view. Ease of use. Super Steady Shot built into the camera.The high megapixels enable you to take high quality photos that will look great when blown up. Does this mean that this camera will take better pictures than a Nikon D300 because the megapixel count is higher... No, not at all that was a common misconception I learned. But knowing that I wanted to take a lot of pictures and make large digital prints to make my office look less lame, I figured I should go a step higher to get the blown-up image quality that I want.The live view is great for so many reasons. Right on the display, it tells you all your settings from battery life, flash, aperture, etc... all while giving a great idea what your image will look like. Keep in mind, what you see on the live view isn't 100% what you'll see when you load the photos on computer or photoshop.Ease of use: Grab the camera, go over the manual, play with the settings, take pictures. Coming from someone who knew nothing about cameras until about 2 weeks ago, the learning curve was easy with this camera. Right out of the box, you can set everything to auto and take great pictures just like a small digital camera. But for more advanced photos you simply learn by trial and error and the live view helps you see what you might need to adjust when taking photos. So even if you've never touched an SLR camera, you begin to learn what ISO, f/5.6, and all the other settings are and how to use them just by taking good pictures... or bad ones!Super Steady Shot: Clear images, built into the camera, not the lens like other manufacturers. Down the line it can help you save some money because you can buy less expensive lenses because you don't need to pay the extra money to get the image stabilization in the lens like Canon or Nikon.So why get this camera vs. other brands? First off, this camera is great for anyone wanting to get into digital SLR's. If you have old Minolta A-mount lenses you can use them with this camera. There are websites that give compatibility charts with some of the old lenses that you have.If you have a bunch of DSLR Nikon and Canon gear, well that sucks for Sony because you won't be buying an A350 anytime soon. If you did, then you're either dumb or have a lot of free time and money to blow. However, if you're thinking about getting a camera, Sony makes a great product and offers tons of features in the camera at a low cost. Down the road, Sony will launch more professional and higher priced cameras so if you're starting out on a DSLR journey, you can begin it with Sony and start collecting lenses, tripods, filters and all the other happy stuff that goes into the expensive hobby of digital photography.Side note: I think this camera was $100 cheaper when I bought it 2 weeks ago. I got the Sony A350X kit (The X is the 2 lens kit, the A350K kit is a 1 lens kit) so I don't know what the deal is there. But all in all, it's a great buy.Oh yeah, if you're trying to decide whether or not to buy the A300 or A350, in case you didn't know the only difference, literally is the megapixels. So unless you are going to blow up your images, go save yourself $200 bucks and get the A300. If you're going to make large prints like I am, then go with the A350.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "What a great camera", "Author": "Fun Guy \"Drive it like you stole it\"", "ReviewID": "R2QX95PF4FBR3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a long time for the Nikon D80 to come down in price.

Can use any lens compared to canon rebel and Nikon where the image stabilization is in the lens (which is expensive)4. Good form factor ...fits nice in hands and Stylish5. LCD tilts out ....very nice feature which opens up a lot of new \"camera angles\" for the picture.6. Very fast autofocusing ....and produce really great pictures7. Options to shoot RAW, Jpeg & RAW+Jpeg8. Controls are very easy to use.....9. Even beginners can take amazing pictures with this camera....dont get fooled by those pictures in various websites....( i had this doubt before buying and later found that the canon and nikon pictures given in net are mostly taken by hardcore proffessionals...where as sony pictures are from beginners )10. Battery last long...it is of least worry11. Nice fitting of parts .....and no squeaking sounds....except a little inside the grip under the trigger.The Bads....1. Slowest continous shooting in its class !! if you like your camera to take 3-4 pictures in a second go for cannon or nikon. This shoots continous pictures almost like a point and shoot.2.Auto Exposure bracketing step is 0.7 which is way too Low in comparison to canon rebel and nikons....if you are into HDR this is not the camera3.Sony lenses are very expensive and have limited choices....well i am yet to try others like tamaron or minolta .....carlZeis is too expensive !4. the strap supplied with the camera is lousy5. Body made in Japan...kit lens made in china ....and it shows the quality difference.6. Flash timing is few micro seconds slow...then what ? some \"subjects\" who have higher reflex action will blink their eyes and they look \"sleepy\" in the pictures (I always blink and my wife dont so i look sleepy in all pics)7. this camera and all SLRs use Compact flash card!! No SD,No M2, No produo, no micro SD......I realised this only after getting the camera and i didnt find this info in anyother review so i am writing it.so better order a 4gb card ( yes you need that) with 30mb/s speed when you buy this camera.Tips1.dont forget to buy a LCD protecting cover along with this camera ...LCD is tiltable and generic covers wont fit.2. dont forget to buy a filter either UV or polarizer ....this will help you to keep finger prints out of your lens...and it is lot cheaper to change a broken filter than to change a Lens!3.

However, if this camera continues to perform as new it is a really good buy.  It was the 14+ megapixels that sold me; nothing comparable was available from others.I only bought the body, as the cheapy lenses offered in packages were of poor Chinese quality.  Why Sony would sell such junk with a good camera, thereby degrading it, is beyond me.  Only buy the body; the cheap lenses are crap. Instead I bought the 18-250 and 11-18mm Sony lenses, which each cost as much as the camera, but the quality is very good.  (I've covered these separately here).All functions work as advertised.  I don't use the LCD at all taking pictures, which I suppose goes back to the film viewfinder days.  But I find it impossible to see anything outside, and you save battery life by not running the LCD all the time. Battery life is excellent over a long period of time, and you can easily fill an 8 gig card with several hundred pictures before making a change.On the other hand what you see in the viewfinder or LCD is NOT what you get.  The value of \"live view\" escapes me. There is a claim of 95% for the viewfinder and 91% for the LCD, but from what I've seen at least a quarter or more of the picture is cut off.  If you want something in the center of your picture you have to compensate for it by raising its position to the top of the view to get it centered.  This is a real nuisance, although it apparently seems to be the case with some other digital SLRs as well.  I haven't had to deal with this kind of problem since the old rangefinder days and it is really unacceptable on a relatively advanced  product. You can use a point and shoot and not have to deal with this.  The other nuisance is that the lenses make a racket when the camera is turned on, because even with the lens cap on it is adjusting autofocus.I'm giving the camera 3 stars based on my experiences so far, after almost a year in use and several thousand shots. It might have been 4 or 5 but for the negatives I described above.  I say \"so far\" because I have lost faith in absolute Sony quality.

Choi", "ReviewID": "R1KWS098M262RP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose the Sony a350 in a very close call over the Canon Rebel XSi. A friend bought the Canon, and we are both happy, so it comes down to preferences. Here is my personal experience with the Sony, with known differences compared with the Canon noted.Please note that I am a hobbyist, rather than a professional.Pros: takes beautiful, clear, and sharp pictures even with the kit lenses. If it were on picture quality alone, the a350 would get a definite 5. This is the most important point of the review. The picture quality is simply awesome.The Sony has excellent low light performance because of the 3200 iso speed (the Canon only goes to 1600, which I have found makes a definite difference in these situations). There is some noise, but it is acceptable to me.The tiltable LCD screen is a nice touch.Battery life is good, and the controls are easy to use after a short learning curve.While it has the highest resolution (14.2MP) of any camera in its class, I'm not sure how much of an advantage this is, since I usually don't need to shoot at that resolution, plus I've seen some reviews where the detail on the Canon in certain settings is actually better.CONS: The biggest disappointment with this camera by far is the built-in flash which utilizes a pre-flash that causes the dreaded sleepy eye effect in most pictures taken in dark settings. I have young children, and they tend to be affected greatly by this feature. I can't seem to find a way to defeat the pre-flash. The problem is much less pronounced when it is used for fill-in in the daytime. This makes the 3200 iso much more important because I now elect to shoot at high speed and no flash. I get much better results this way. Apparently, the Canon does not have this problem quite as much, although it has pre-flash as well.The continuous burst shooting speed is rated at somewhere between 2-2.5 shots per second, slower than the Canon (more in the 3-3.5 range). So far, it hasn't been that big of a deal for me, but I don't usually shoot sports or similar activities.The Sony is a bit heavier than the Canon, but it would be hard to be cognizant of the difference unless you owned both cameras.BOTTOM LINE: I am mostly satisfied with this camera, except for the annoying flash qualities. If you shoot sports a lot, go with the Canon.

I was contemplating the Nikon D80, Canon XSi, Pentax K20/K200, Olympus E510, and the Sony A350.  I really wanted a Sony A700 but I was constrained by pricing.  Since I knew I had an African vacation coming (early October) I wanted the camera as an upgrade over the P&S; that I had (Canon S70).  I liked the S70 when plenty of light is available but lowlight and flash photography are way less than adequate and I wanted more zoom.I ended up with the Sony A350, a SAL 18250mm lens, extra batteries, vertical grip, and when it came out, a HVL-F42AM flash.  I based my decision on reviews and handholding but investigating menu systems.  The Canon XSi did not show better image quality; Pentax K20 was too much $$ at the time (same for A700); Nikon D80 was old technology; Olympus E520 was a serious consideration but in my interpretation of the reviews the Sony A350 was better.Pros:-In camera image stabilization: nuff said-Larger physical size than other entry level: Olympus and Canon are too small for me.-Legacy Minolta AF lenses: I picked up Minolta 28mm F2.8 and it is a pretty nice lens.-Reasonably easy to learn: menu system is simpler than the Olympus, Canon, & Nikon cameras in my opinion.  I do not know about Pentax.-Practice can make some great pictures.-Live View: this single camera is still the best implementation of any on the market.-With external flash pictures can come out pretty nice. IMO super fast lenses are not the panacea for lowlight shooting.  Sometimes a flash is necessary.  The F42AM is much, much better than the built-in flash.Cons-Sometimes I think I set a picture up correct and when I see the results, I go \"HUH???\": I know it is me but occasionally I do not know why.-High ISO noise: stuffing lots of megapixels onto the sensor.-Low frames/second-Not weathered sealed (no Sony is): I knew this but did not realized the issue enough.  Africa IS DUSTY.

Gables \"Ken Gables\"", "ReviewID": "R22GKBH3B3ZPCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a semiprofessional photographer who, as a former Minolta user, has been trying to patiently wait on Sony to come out with a suitable pro model so as to continue to use lenses and accessories dedicated to my system.  A year ago I bought this camera along with Sony's 18-250mm zoom lens, used it for some work, including a wedding.  My first impression of the camera, upon immediately opening the box was a bit negative; it is small and has a very plastic feel.  But after using the camera only a few minutes I was impressed with the responsiveness of the auto focus and very impressed with the 14MP detail.  (I had been using a 6MP Konica-Minolta Maxxum 7D)  The a350 made some great pictures.  With that said I decided to have this camera body converted to use as an infrared camera (paying a lab to remove the infrared sensor) and have been using it for infrared photography for a year now, with good results.  Since then I have been waiting for Sony to come out with a true pro model, which it has: the Sony a700 and a900.  But in the time I have had using the a350, I have come to really enjoy two features which the higher end Sony models still do not offer: live view, and a tilting sensor.  These are really great features and I will wait until Sony has a pro model with these.  With that said I have recently made a purchase of a second a350 body, taking advantage of some great closeout deals as the a380 is destined to replace this camera.  Most of my work is landscapes and environmental portraiture.  I hike with my cameras, I go on float trips with my cameras, I wade in streams with my cameras, I expose my cameras to a lot of risk.  The idea of dunking a $3000 camera is nauseating.  I can now have two small camera bodies to hike with and have a relatively small chance of such a disaster.  This camera can produce great results with good exposures and technic.  Professional reviews of the a350 camera tend to be negative regarding its performance in low light and high ISOs.  How I would respond is that you just can't put 14MP on an APS size sensor and have great performance in low light, regardless of the camera brand.  With that said, 99 percent of the people interested in this camera would likely never notice this 'low light' performance issue.  A camera is a tool, the camera body is only a component.  The skill of the photographer is still much more important than miscellaneous technical details that tech people like to argue about.

Still, for anyone who happens to be looking at buying one new or used, here goes.I bought the Sony A350 only to use some old Minolta Maxxum lenses (from film camera period), particularly the 70-210 \"beercan\" macro lens, which I absolutely loved back in the day. So my review will give my impressions of the quality using those lenses, plus the kit 18-70 lens. I'll try to keep it brief and to the point. Please note that this review is based on just 3 days of use, so take it with a grain of salt.a) I normally always try to stick to Japan made models and this was a prime reason for going with an older model (other than it would be cheaper to buy older). I bought it used and the price I got it for jives with the lower end of what is advertised on Amazon.b) Considering it's Japanese, I can emphatically state it does not come close to what I expect from a camera made in Japan. In fact, the grip when pressed even lightly gives in a little and makes a sound. Not exactly a vote of confidence for something made in Japan. So the overall construction while reasonably good, is not something I would say is great by Japanese standards. It's a pity that Sony chooses to lower the typical Japanese standard.c) Onto the kit 18-70 lens. In terms of construction, it's just a piece of plastic junk. It is very light with a cheap feel. Just would not be able to compare it to the older Minolta lenses, since they're apples and oranges.d) In terms of picture quality, the kit lens gives you ho-hum results. The images are definitely sharper than my older Minolta lenses, but still nothing compared to similarly priced Canons or Nikons. Pics taken in RAW give you a better end result when tweaking yourself, as opposed to going with the camera based algorithms, which does too much noise reduction and makes the images soft. In fact, that is the biggest complaint I have with the camera, the pictures are just a little too soft. I like a certain amount of softness, but not to the extent this camera takes it.e) Features are good with enough to please most people and are relatively straightforward to use, even for someone who is been out of using a camera for almost 2 decades and is now getting back into the game.  Perhaps that's why I find it alright, since I don't have the baggage that comes from knowledge and experience with better layouts with other cameras.f) I'll briefly talk about using Minolta lenses with this camera and Minolta Maxxum flashes, since I know there are people out there who look specifically for this info. First, the old Maxxum lenses and subsequent Konica Minolta Maxxum lenses work on the alpha mount that Sony has continued to use after their purchase of the Konica Minolta camera business. In fact, it was a little difficult finding this info on the net, so I'll state it clearly here. The alpha mount and the flash hotshoe are exactly the same from the Konica Minolta days. The only difference is that the current lenses have 8 electronic points to connect to the camera to take advantage of the more advanced digital SLR based features. The older Minolta lenses have only 5 points and are therefore not optimal for use with current digital model SLRs.g) Similar to the Minolta lenses, the old Minolta flash I have, which is a basic Minolta 2000xi, works beautifully. Does not have advanced features and I don't believe the camera could take advantage of it even if it were a more advanced model flash. But that's just hearsay from what I've read, rather than actual experience. Suffice it to say that I believe all Minolta Maxxum flashes will work on Sony DSLRs that have the old Minolta hotshoe.h) The quality of the pictures taken with the Minolta lenses (I've used it so far with just 2 lenses, a fixed 50mm and the \"legendary\" 70-210 \"beercan\" macro. Pictures are noticeably softer than even the kit lens and you can imagine that it's not a good thing. The 70-210 lens still produces great pictures with wonderful bokeh, which was always one of the hallmarks of that lens. Still, the loss of sharpness is a bit of a disappointment.Overall, I would recommend this camera to those who are looking to do something like I am. I plan to buy a Nikon, on the guaranteed assumption I will keep up with photography. In order to see if I will, I decided to buy a cheaper camera to begin with for a while, practice using it with older lenses I have and take my time re-learning what I need to before I go and spend the money on a more expensive Nikon. Sure, I could have started out with a cheaper model Nikon, but why bother when the overall economics worked in favour of the Sony and works well enough for practice. Plus, the Sony coupled with the old Minolta lens will produce great pictures that have a certain look and feel to it. And at the end of the day, it's not just sharpness of the image that matters, as seems to be the items of contention for everyone these days. People forget that it is not really the camera that take a great picture, but the eye, mind and heart behind the camera. If you cannot compose and process a great picture based on instinct and experience, no camera in the world can help you.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fun is back!

I have had several digital cameras over the years. I had a Mavica FD-71 and then I stepped up to the F-828...I loved that camera as it was so easy to use and a lot of fun. Unfortunately I was duped into selling it to buy a Sony H7...boy what a mistake, the H7 was a real come down from the F-828. Well I got rid of the H7 and got an Alpha A-100...good picture quality but not a fun or easy camera to use.Now to the A-350... From the moment I picked this camera up and took my first picture with it I knew I was holding something special, thoughts of that old F-828 came rushing back. Finally a camera that was easy to use again! Lets face it photography should be fun right? Well I think it should and the A-350 is just that. Granted there are a couple of things I would like to have seen different such as the grip below the shutter isn't as deep as the A-100...so it doesn't feel quiet right with my big hand gripping it and the other is I do wish Sony had put a better processor in it...not to say that is a bad processor but it could be better.If the A-700 or A-900 had the live view and tilt screen well I may have just went hog wild and spent the extra for one of those models. But after hearing about the live view and tilt screen on the A-350..well...I knew it was as close to the F-828 as I was gonna get.I also found the battery life to be a little disappointing. Now granted I haven't had the A-350 very long so only time will tell if and how my feelings may change but for now its like having an F-828 with the feature I always wished it had as in the ability to have a long zoom lens cause to be honest if the F-828 had the ability to zoom further then just 200mm I would never have sold it on amazon to someone in NY.

This camera seemed to have things Nikon just didn't", "Author": "Richard Hughes \"Pickydick\"", "ReviewID": "R2OWFZ44BKZNSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was always a Nikon fan but when I saw the Alpha 350 and read about its reatures I was truly impressed. For a lot less than a grand it seemed to have features that Nikon only had in $2500 to $3000 models and sometimes not even in them. I really loved the live view and the tilting view screen. Nikon didn't have that at the time and I'm not sure they even had live view. I have a 10 year old Sony touch screen handy cam that to me still seems \"state of the art\" other than not taking DVDs. I'm not sure that's so bad considering how easily DVDs scratch. The hanycam is really nice because you can turn the screen so you can see yourself as you are recording. I loved this because I was hiking the AT at the time and could do commentaries of myself. You can't turn the viewfinder of the Alpha 350 so you can take pictures of yourself but you can turn it down so you can hold it above your head and take pictures above the crowd. You can move it so it is looking up so you can hold it near ground level and that give you a \"dogs eye\" view. That's one of the few things that sold me about the camera.  Steady shop is built into the camera body so the lenses are less expensive, you can use Minalta and some other lenses. The menus are very easy to use and all the bottons are nicely placed. I could go on and on but there are plenty of other reviews on this camera. I also got it at a great deal from Amazon.  I only wish I had waited 3 years because I am now in love with the Alpha 55. Only kidding, I couldn't have waited. But the Alpha 55 seems, for a non professional camera to be way ahead of what Nikon has in its price range.  I think when Nikon was actually made in Japan it was the best. But now this is not the case and they  make it were ever they can get the best price. Look at the amount of reviews they have for their cameras. A camera might have 3000 reviews. Can a company pump that many camera out and really maintain the quality they use to be famous for. Obviously there are still a lot of people who are brand oriented and aren't really looking at the quality and features. Kind of like republicans. The only good republican was the first one and that was Lincoln. But people are still brand loyal regarless of the product. I bought my first Nikon when I was in the Marines back in 1963 or so. Back then it was strictly the Nikon F and I truly believe it was the greatest work of art I ever owned. But I think times have changed.  I better stop boring you people. I truly love the Alpha 350. You probably can't find them unless you buy them used, but most people care for there cameras with kid gloves so if you bought a used one it would probably be like new. This camera is a work of art, it's sitting on my coffee table and I still admire its quality.

Camera stopped working properly too soon", "Author": "Jocelyn Staskus", "ReviewID": "R36NVNRB73Y92J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At this point I will never buy another Sony product ever again. After only 4 months my camera stopped focusing properly.I took the camera to the nearest Sony store to see if their proclaimed \"camera-guru\" would be able to ascertain if it was human or machine error. When I saw he was taking shots in the store at 1/800 @f8 with no flash, I was horrified. This guy had NO CLUE WHAT HE WAS DOING! I was further irritated when he asked why the image playback was flashing the blackouts and blowouts. Why should I have to explain to a Sony employee how their product works?When I called customer service, I was informed that I had to ship it to their repair center (at MY cost even though the camera is in warranty and the problem in question was \"something common\"). When I informed them that I professional photographer who needs the camera by a certain date, I was told they could not guarantee that I would have my camera back by said date (understandable). When I asked if there was a possibility I could get a loaner, he said \"I'll talk to my boss and do all that I can to see if that's possible.\" only to come back with, \"I'm sorry, there really is no loaner program for consumer-level product. Not unless you want to buy our pro-sumer equipment. Yeah you know you spend the bazillion dollars and then you get it...\" Then I was then kept on the phone for 2 HOURS while the CSO waited for the screen to come up that would get me a work-order number. Instead of offering to call me back, he just left me hanging there saying every few minutes \"I just don't know why it's so slow.\" After he did get me a work-order number, there was no added courtesy for the wait such as, \"I understand your urgency and need for the camera so I will do all that I can to see that this issue is expedited.\" or \"Let me check on that loaner again, perhaps there is something I can do.\"I shipped my camera out - which would not be arriving overnight thanks to the 2 hour service call.I ended up calling back the next morning still furious at how the initial call was handled. I spoke about how poor the support was in-store and during the previous service call. The gentleman told me that when the repair center receives my camera, they will look at it and determine what needs to be repaired, in which instance I may be able to have Sony provide a loaner.I called back the day after that and was informed that the camera had been received at the service facility, but not yet assigned to a technician. The camera would be assigned  around 3:30. I called back later wanting to know the status and was then told that it takes 24-48 business hours to assign the camera to a technician. The CSO then said she would expedite my issue to the best of her ability but that there is no guarantee I will have it back in time.I do not want to worry about having my camera back in time. If they check it and it needs repair fine. But, while it is being repaired I would really appreciate if Sony would get over themselves and provide me with a loaner. I doubt that a customer would call back everyday if they weren't passionate about their equipment or the function it serves. You would think Sony would have common sense to realize this.To top it off, their service number is not an 800 number. It is a 239 number. Meaning that not only were my minutes eaten up by the first CSO's incapability to perform customer service, but I don't just get to be upset about their poor customer service and incapacity to provide great customer support, but I also get to be angry about the minutes that are eaten up on my phone-plan and the very real possibility that I will have to pay for a phone-call that lasted much longer than it needed to.I have Never Ever experienced such poor service. It is clear that Sony does not trust its customers and has no interest in fostering lasting relationships with their customers.
