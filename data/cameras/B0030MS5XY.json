{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a keeper", "Author": "Angie Pie", "ReviewID": "R208ASC6SLD61J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got rid of my Fujifilm z10fd (7.2 MP) after being sick and tired of grainy pictures, even in brightly lit, outdoor conditions. Previous to that camera, I owned a Sony Cybershot DSC-S40, which was 4.1 MP camera that took fantastic pictures. I did a lot of research on dozens of point-and-shoots and I settled on this one for its affordable price, zoom range, and special features. Plus, I was really happy with my S40, so I was pretty confident with my decision to go with Sony.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera's performance. Initially I was a bit disappointed, but I attribute that to playing around with a lot of DSLRs recently, and obviously there is no way that this DSC-H55 can match those in picture quality. Nevertheless, this camera has a lot of strong points that make it a great buy. Its best feature is its 10x optical zoom. At full zoom, you can still see the minutest details. The sweep panorama feature is a ton of fun to use. Performance in well-lit conditions are excellent, and the flash is powerful enough to illuminate a room when lighting is not sufficient. I am also very happy with the manual controls that Sony gives me. Becoming familiar with this is going to be very rewarding when it comes time to shoot in low-light conditions.Sony's menu is intuitive and easy to use. Image stabilization works very well, the percentage of blurry pictures that come out is negligible. Also, red-eye isn't too bad on this camera. Every single picture I took with my fujifilm came out with a red-eye, which was extremely irritating. Boy am I happy those days are over. The smile shutter feature is fun to experiment with. Not really a necessity, but most of my friends who have snatched this camera out of my hands have been in awe.Lastly, the camera itself looks great. The silver color looks sleek, and its size is fairly small for the power and features it includes. Not as tiny as the Sony W series cameras or the compact Canon powershots out there, but it is certainly pocketable. It also very lightweight considering its size.A few minor gripes: Even though this camera uses the Sony G lens, I was really hoping that it was made with a Carl Zeiss lens instead. G lenses are used on Sony's alpha DSLR cameras, so this does not bother me too much. Also, it would be great to have an optical viewfinder. But what new digital camera has those nowadays...Those minor annoyances are not enough to make me return this camera. I am very pleased with its performance.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Eric Holand", "ReviewID": "RWN84KFAJ2C2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great. The panorama feature is really neat. I took this camera with me to Chicago a week after purchase. With the panorama shot I was able to sweep the camera in a fluid motion to capture a pic of the whole city and with the megapixel load able to blow it up to a very good size with no blocked finish. The zoom on this thing is great, even from the top of the Sears Tower I was able to zoom in and take shot clear across town with great clarity. The pics themselves as long as you let it do its thing and focus come out crystal clear. This camera lights up any situation when needed with ease, very brightn flash. This camera isnt to bulky, I had no problem carring it when my wife need to lighten up the load in her purse for a bit. The video is really sharp it shoots HD video and is clear. One thing I wish it had was a HDMI port for direct play on a television but once downloaded to a hard drive and replayed it comes out HD quality. The steady shot works well. It is a nice piece of equipent for the price and takes really great photos. If in auto focus it takes a few seconds to par up so you have to wait to let it do its thing once adjusted the photos are professional quality.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55", "Author": "Bradd Alan Dantuma", "ReviewID": "RNTYEEIW7H8IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased with the camera....bought it just in time for a trip to Yellowstone National Park & the pictures were incredible.

The first pictures I took were high school graduation pictures.  I wasn't even that close to the action but when I uploaded the pictures onto the computer and saw them on a bigger screen, I was amazed to see just how clear the pictures were. It was as if I was standing right there w/ the graduates.  I have also taken the camera on my trips to Disneyland and California Adventure and the photos were quite stunning.  I had the Disney photos printed at my local Costco and I am so happy with the results.This is my fourth digital camera (my previous cameras were 2 Sonys and 1 Canon) but it's the first with optical image stabilization and so far I don't know how I ever lived without it.  I think out of the hundreds of shots that I have taken I can count the total of blurred shots on one hand.I would have given it 5 stars except for one minor detail.  The battery/memory card compartment cover bugs the heck out of me.  I don't think I've ever seen a cheaper plastic used as a cover before.  Every time I want to take out the card or the battery to be charged, I have to be careful to not put too much pressure on the darn thing.  It looks like it could easily break off.  The last thing I want is to have to tape the cover down w/ duct tape.  Let's hope it will never have to come to that!Despite the cover issue,I am quite satisfied with camera.  My trip to Hawaii is in 3 weeks I am looking forward to many more wonderful shots taken with the Sony DSC-H55.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Packed with features", "Author": "travelmaxwk", "ReviewID": "R3CXU32EV6FJ30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far the h55 is great.

For some pictures taken outdoors, it fades the natural color of the scenaries. It also washes off photos taken indoors. One another thing is the picture in the View finder(LCD Screen) is grainy. This really irritates on a camera with 14 MP and 10x zoom. It does this even while shooting a object at a normal distance.I already have a Panasonic Lumix ZS7 and this camera Sony DCS-H55 comes no where close to the picture quality.Overall, I won't recommend this camera for this price($199)", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "gmklee", "ReviewID": "R32AZUOOW1W4FZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been waiting for a reasonably-priced small camera with lots of zoom capability to come along, and this is it!  Got it in anticipation of a trip to Europe and found it to be all I was looking for and more! It is heavier than most cameras out there today with similar resolution, but that's because of the great zoom capability and well worth it. The sweep panorama function is fun, but I found that the photos are not the highest quality as some features are disabled in sweep panorama mode. I found the Intelligent Auto setting to be just perfect for me in most situations. Great battery life between charges.

I've taken the camera on several trips and have taken a gazillion pictures of my cat.  Some of the photos are crystal clear; I've take pictures of my cat where I can literally count cat hairs. I've created a photobook and calendar using photos I took from the camera and was very pleased with the results.  I was able to enlarge some of the pictures using the software that came with the camera without noticing any degradation in quality. Some of the pictures in the photobook were in 8 x 11 format; they are maybe just a little fuzzy in some of the corners, but they look great for my amateur purposes.I have been playing around with the various shooting modes (manual, scenes, easy, etc.) and am pleased that, for the most part, the pictures come out best when the camera is in automatic mode.  As an amateur who wants to be able to take good pictures without having to know a lot about ISO settings, etc., this is a relief.The 10x optical zoom is great.  I love the smile shutter feature; I was skeptical but it really works. I also love the sweep panarama feature, although I haven't tried printing any of these shots.  The burst setting and the action scene setting are also fun.  The focus lock has also come in handy a lot.I can attest that the camera can withstand a drop of three feet onto pavement; the shell is a little nicked up but it hasn't impacted the pictures.  I'll be using the wrist strap from now on, however.A couple of minor issues that I've noticed:- You have to really hold the camera steady in low light without the flash. With the flash no problem, but if you are in indirect light, indoors, or twilight, you need the flash or a very steady hand.  It is possible to get a clear picture without the flash; I've done it, but I had to really concentrate on holding still.- Sometimes the camera has trouble figuring out what to focus on. This can sometimes be fixed by reactivating the focus lock, or if that doesn't work, changing the focus mode, but sometimes neither works. This has most often come up when I'm using the zoom feature or in low light.  It isn't enough of a problem to make me unhappy with the camera.- Video is really dark, you need a lot of light to get a good video (especially if you are shooting video of a black cat).I would not hestitate to recommend this camera.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Triumphs", "Author": "Ian S.

Time for a change though and the game has moved on.  I chose this camera over other similar models for a number of reasons.  First off Sony have at last embraced SD cards - no deal otherwise.  After that it was the high definition rating, the features and the price.  It is way cheaper than the Panasonic.  I chose the 10X zoom model over the lesser, cheaper Sony models because it has better controls, a better lens and a wider wide angle setting.I just got it today so this is an instant review but a walk around the block in the NY snow and it was easy to snap away and get excellent quality photos.  I deliberately shot into the sun and still got excellent contrast throughout.  I shot faces with a bright background and the balance between face and background was well handled.  I also shot in a similar situation and the auto flash compensated.  Finally I used the panorama mode.  So easy and an excellent, interesting photo resulted.  But it was grainy when blown up to full screen mode.One feature missing is an override on flash to turn it on always.  The auto mode may be enough to compensate.  I am shooting in centre metering mode.  Also available are averaging and spot.  Lots of other manual controls available and full manual mode.So far it is love.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Money!", "Author": "kj1129", "ReviewID": "R2SCMYEDP4ORYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I knew I had to have this camera the minute I saw it - the photos are crisp and clear.

We bought it for business purposes and the main charity our business sponsors. Being able to take clear pictures and videos for the blog and website is critical for our causes. One of the ways we raise money to support The Highground (a WI Veterans Memorial Park), is to take photos/videos of our Harley riding excursions. So imagine our surprise when it was stolen on one of our trips last year!  We had all sorts of goodies on it that are lost forever. So we bought a comparable camera, and took numerous photos that just didn't turn out well at all. That's why we came back to this one... it can hold a focus exquisitely and the zoom is just out of this world!!! (especially for new digital camera users)This camera captures images just as you see them at the precise moment you snap the image. The screen is crystal clear so you really know what you are capturing. The panoramic feature is great and fun to play with especially with nature shots. The colors are vibrant and it looks as if everything is alive. The video is a high enough quality for small business owners to do videos for websites and YouTube clips. This camera comes with re-chargable batteries (which is so needed these days). Additionally,the software is brilliant- saving and editing your content is much easier to use than others. We loved this camera so much that we searched and waited to make another purchase (after the dud of its replacement- a nonSony camera) until we could find it again.

I am still trying to learn about it.  The easy setting is indeed easy, but can produce some bizzar pictures.  One of the pictures I took with that setting resulted in a flash, on a bright day!

I shut off the flash and it took a much better picture.  The easy setting at night has a unbearably long wait between when you push the button and when the picture is actually taken.  The manual setting has only two f-stops: 3.5 and 8.  The shutter speed, however is great.  It ranges from 1/1600 to 30 seconds!

It does have some nifty features on it such as the panoramic sweep picture, great zoom and the face recognition is spot on.

Outside under bright sunny conditions, the pictures come out pretty good, however indoors the picture quality is really inconsistent. Sometimes the flash washes the picture and creates a white hue and sometimes the pictures come out very grainy with soft colors. I compared this to my girlfriend's Canon 1200 and the picture quality on the Canon came out clearer and sharper sometimes.The camera is also really bulky, which I wouldnt mind as much if the picture quality was spot on, but it doesn't so no reason for it to be this big.I returned mine after using it one day.
