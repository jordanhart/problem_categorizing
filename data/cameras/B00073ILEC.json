{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AWESOME Little Camera", "Author": "K. McCloskey", "ReviewID": "R18AQ8Y5UU2Q7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this little thing 2 months ago for my birthday, and am quite happy with it.  I took it with me on a vacation to Japan, and was able to take home tons of picture memories.I'll start with the cons:1) You have to hold it still for several seconds when taking pictures, or else they will turn out blurry.  This is only a real problem when taking spur-of-the-moment pictures, or if in a hurry, which does not happen too often.2) Flash is extremely bright, so close objects will wash out.(Just turn off the flash and this is not a problem)3) Digital zoom - not as good as optical, but not too bad.Now for the pros:1) This thing is small!  It came with a neckstrap, so I wore it as a necklace during my vacation, and it was so light I barely noticed it.2) Lots of memory- my 512mb card holds at least 530 pictures/videos, and there's still room.3) Really easy to operate, I was able to change the flash settings, delete pictures, use the self-timer, take video and review pictures without even having to read the instruction manuel.4) Quick and easy file transfer to my computer-just hook it up to the USB, and drag and drop.5) Extrememly bright flash, while listed as a con, is also nice when taking pictures in the dark, as they will show up as if it is the middle of the day, provided you are not too close.Overall, I gotta say I love this little camera.  Sure, the picture quality isn't the best, but if you are in decent lighting conditions, and you can hold still for a few seconds, you can get some good quality pictures.", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Budget camera delivers", "Author": "Nichole A. Padjen", "ReviewID": "R222AOCL8QPBCU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good camera for the money. Don't be expecting amazing 5mp pictures or anything. If you are in a dark area, it is hard to see on the screen what you are shooting. Of course, when you actually take the picture, the flash brightens the area. If you are not still, pictures can be a bit fuzzy...but a 20$ tripod can take care of that problem. Small, can fit in a purse or pocket. Great for kids, comes with a carrying strap so they don't drop it. All in all, I would recomend it for someone who is starting out and wants a VERY basic camera, or for a child. If you are looking for high quality photos this is not the camera for you. I bought it for my 14 year old sister who uses it to take pictures at the football game, and put them on her website (which does not require high quality photos). Her photos look pretty decent when printed in a 3x5 size.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "we returned it!", "Author": "Marie", "ReviewID": "RBJH2BFS874SA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this for my son for his birthday (thinking it would be a nice small (easy to use) camera and a good deal for the price).  We were wrong!  My son took about fifteen pictures (inside) and every picture was out of focus.  My husband and I tried it too (thinking that maybe my son just wasn't holding the camera still enough) and the pictures were the same.  Every picture, with the exception of one that my husband took outside, was blurry.We returned it and upgraded (slightly) to the Kodak CX7330.  The difference in quality is amazing.  With the Kodak the pictures are crystal clear.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera for the price", "Author": "M. Wolfe", "ReviewID": "RFH064T4KYDIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera with just a couple of shortcomings. I use it for when I go fishing to take pictures of my catches. It fits perfectly in my pocket and takes great pictures outdoors. Indoor is a little trickier. In dim lighting it is a little difficult to see the LCD screen to know what you are taking a picture of and if the flash is used on a closeup photo it will wash out the subject a bit. The wash out issue can be fixed by using the computer software that comes with the camera to edit the picture. You'll also want to get a memory card for this camera otherwise you'll only be able to take 8 pictures at the best quality and resolution before running out of space. I bought a 256Meg card which allows me to take over 200 photos which is more than enough. All in all this is a great camera for the price and I would definitely buy it again.", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Danny L.

I find it takes clear pics, very small, so easy to carry. I have no problems with it at all. I can carry it in the case on my belt or in a pocket. I recommend it highly.", "Date": "February 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not too bad, but not spectacular", "Author": "F. Gao \"Althena001\"", "ReviewID": "R9VAUTUUJEFL7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my first camera, and I got a cheap one cuz I was going off to college and would like to send pictures home. I like that the camera is compact, and it does take pretty good pictures, but the double flash confuses people and so the picture might come out a bit blurry. And if it's not held perfectly still, the picture could come out pretty blurry, too.When the light isn't perfect or very bright, the screen is pitch black and I usually have to eyeball and aim for where the subject of my picture was.It's a good camera on a budget, but 3.0MP isn't that great quality in general. The pictures usually turn out better/more normal when they're uploaded.Overall... it's got some pros and cons for sure, but... use your better judgment. =) I don't recommend NOT getting it, but I'm not raving about it.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Picture Takers Review", "Author": "MLT \"sandwhich\"", "ReviewID": "RJCA1L44ZS730", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture taking is my life!!  I would almost be board at family functions without a camra in my hands.  I got my Vivitar camra at a pawn shop for $10 and it is amazing.  I took it to my PaPa's house over the summer and i got some beutiful pictures.this is an easy camra to work an i love the way it takes vidio even if it is soundless.  for the 4th of july i took some videos of the fireworks and it was so much fun to look at even without sound.This was not my first camra what so ever.  I have had many other camras and have camras that cost well over 500 dollors, but this camra is just fine for me.  The only thing I don't like about it is the zoom.  When you zoom in to like 4x it makes the picture really blurry.  But if you are expirenced in photo taking it shouldn't be a problem.I recommend this camra and i thinkj it was a good find.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "J.

Hernandez", "ReviewID": "RQJ2G8TI63Q62", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. It is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (Or for a beginner in photography or a child.) You have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. Also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.The only thing I like about this camera is it's size. It's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag...Anyway, I'm buying a better one soon.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "TWright", "ReviewID": "R2RZ7AHODUAYJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my 5 year old grandson.  It's small enough to handle and large enough to hold steady during an exposer.  The general operation of this camera is very simple and easy to use.

This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory.

I was very happy with it for about a year.  For the price, the pictures are actually pretty good quality and the camera is easy to use/compact.  You do have to steady the camera for a few seconds after taking the picture or it will blur but I did not find this to be a problem.  I added extra memory and that was great.  However, after about a year, my battery door latch broke for no apparent reason.  I used tape to keep it shut but eventually that did not work.  I had bought a second camera about the same time as mine for a family member -- the latch on the battery compartment broke on hers as well. These latches just broke off spontaneously and neither camera was dropped or banged.  The camera will not operate normally without the latch secured and cost to repair is as much as the original cost of the camera.  So, for a temporary camera that you can afford to toss after a year or two it is pretty good ... if you plan to keep it longer, I would suggest investing in a better quality item as this one will not last.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice camera with a flash problem", "Author": "R.

I bought this camera on my way to the Houston Astrodome to welcome the evacuee's from Louisiana.  I most definitely wanted pictures of what I witnessed.  Guess what!!  NOT ONE PICTURE TURNED OUT!!I am irate, to say the least.  I trusted this product and was let down during one of our countries historic events.  Simply returning this camera and getting my money back DOES NOT begain to repay me.The program itself is complicated, from the driver download process to viewing the photos.  I saw my pictures only once, then could never find them again.  I took several pictures and some short video, but found that none of them had been saved in the camera.Vivitar, you owe me a HUGE appology.
