{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Point and Shoot I've Owned", "Author": "A. Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R2RLZ8XCZYM3OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this over the acclaimed S90 and glad I did.  Ultimately, I decided to wait on this camera in lieu of purchasing the S90 due to the video features and low light capabilities.  It the past, it's the low light abilities of a camera that really separates one camera from another (while retaining detail / minimizing noise)Naturally these are main features along with the fast lens across all optical zoom levels as well as a decent wide angle (28mm equivalent).I already own a Canon 7D and 20D so wasn't concerned about RAW capabilities.  I ultimately wanted a very compact, highly versatile camera that I could take everywhere.  This camera accomplishes all of that and then some.PROS:-Low light shooting exceeds expectations.  Slightly better than average noise for low lighting shooting.-HD video shooting in 720P exceeded expectations as well.  It is so good that I will probably use it more than my Canon 7D due to the ease of HD shooting.  Allows zooming (optical and digital) and macro while shooting.-240 fps / shooting is a lot of fun.  Definitely low resolution is very noticable and subject to amount of light in terms of quality, but can still shoot fun videos in somewhat lower light conditions.  I use it to capture our dogs playing and chasing after toys.  A very fun option to have in a camera and icing on the cake.-Fantastic macro.  I was wondering about the macro as there was little information available.  Be rest assured this macro is great.-Build quality is great.  The black matte is solid feeling in the hand and has a slight \"rough\" texture that makes it easy to hold and hopefully wear easier.-When zooming out in picture-preview mode, the camera previews 130 pictures on the screen at once!  Very cool.-Small / light enough to pocket it easily ... even in a shirt pocket.-Beautiful 3\" LCD viewing screen.  One of the best ones I've seen.-Very intuitive controls.  Takes a tad to get used to them (especially after using SLR cameras), but once you use them, they are a breeze to navigate and control.  Amazed by the versatility of the simple layout / controls.UPDATE:  Stereo microphones, I believe.CONS (I really don't mind any of these, so just a few minor issues):-Can hear lens zooming while recording video, minor compared to my 7D (granted the 7D has much larger motors).-During slow motion playback, there are no controls for \"fast forward / rewind\" to get to the parts of the video quickly for review.  This would have been very useful, but not included however.-Optical zoom lacking at only x3.8.  Could stand for a bit more.-UPDATE: The ports are annoying to get to (USB / HDMI).  They are behind a hard plastic cover vs. a soft rubberized that is in normal circumstances.  However, this is most likely due to the limited size of the camera and having to put the ports on the side where it is more desirable to have a better wearing hard cover.UPDATE 6/21/10:  I just got back from camping and bringing only this camera.  I am more and more impressed by the low light capabilities and versatility.  I wasn't aware of some interesting features / gimmicks that I actually like.  Examples include a faux fish-eye image modification, tilt-shift image miniaturization effect (blurs top and bottom of the frame), color accent feature (keeps a selected color in the image while the rest is B&W;), color swap (change a color in scene to another while shooting), and a panoramic stitch assist to help align pictures while shooting multiple frames ... to name a few.  It has other features, but these are the most notable in my opinion.What is also interesting (I haven't had a chance to test it out) is that it has a timer / shutter release function based on 1) a smile is detected 2) a wink is detected and 3) a new face entering the scene.  If this works, it sure is an interesting feature.I still intend on updating with new video samples.  Thanks for reading.UPDATE 7/22/10:  If you are considering this camera and budget isn't an issue, Panasonic just announced their new line of compact cameras and most notably the Lumix LX5 which appears to outshine this camera on most if not all capabilities.  It will be approximately $500, however.UPDATE 8/18/10:  Warning!  Canon just announced the SD4500IS as well as the S95.  You should most likely wait for those or another camera at this point.  The S95 adds an HDR mode (cool!) as well as shoots in 720P. The SD4500IS shoots in 1080P!  The S95 has hybrid image stabilization (for macro?) and the SD4500IS has dynamic image stabilization added.  Anyhow, just some tidbits to give you an idea.  Good luck.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Canon SD 4000 IS, or the Canon S90?", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "RN9VO318K8QZF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon SD 4000 IS has been on my \"watch list\" since its announcement a couple of months ago. I have purchased many Canon compacts over the years, and have often been supremely happy with them. My Canon PowerShot S80, for example, which I purchased back in 2005, was one of my favorites Canon ever made, and I used it far into the next cycles of camera production. With this latest Canon, touting a wide-open aperture of f/2.0 coupled with a back-lit CMOS sensor, and with the physically diminutive yet stylistically beautiful design, the promise for me was that the SD 4000 IS camera would meet my latest needs for a low light portable camera. Having already purchased the Canon S90 a few months ago, I was eager to see if the newest incarnation of Canon's low light portables really kept its promise, because the SD 4000 also tempted with HD video recording, which the outstanding S90 unfortunately omitted due to its implementation of the Sony sensor which does not support HD mode.The results? Well, we are seeing quite a number of early positives about the SD 4000 IS, and most of them I cannot knock. It's really a fun camera to use, and many people will find it to their liking. Here are some of the true highlights that I can confirm with my own testing:1. Startlingly beautiful design in a very small form factor with smooth curves and edges2. An outstanding \"rough\" finish on the camera which makes holding the tiny device much more secure3. True f/2.0 shooting (only at the widest end of the zoom) that allows use of the device in low lighting situations where other portables would be unusable4. Outstanding video recording in 720i HD format - videos look really great5. Good display, though not up to the standards of what we would hope for today6. True wide-angle lens7. Some control over shooting settings8. Excellent macro shooting capability (in part due to the large aperture, allowing for shallow depth of field shots at close range)Nevertheless, having used the camera for a while, I would have to say that this camera is not a \"no brainer\" for everyone. There are some notable shortcomings from my own testing:1. Noise levels are not what I had expected - the S90 has less noise than the SD 4000 IS at equivalent settings, and noise levels are apparent even at the lowest ISO settings. This was my biggest letdown.2. Image quality is good, but I had again expected IQ to be at levels quite similar to the S90. I cannot say that the image quality, however, is the same as the S90. There is also a general softness to the images which is not as strongly seen in the S90.3. Total programmatic control over all camera settings is not possible. The camera is rather designed to be used with its predefined scene settings. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but one should understand that the SD 4000 IS is not fully controllable, such as is the case with the S90.4. Video quality is great, but if you are looking for 1080i capability, this camera does not provide it.It seems then, that you will like this camera truly based on your own preferences and willingness to accept compromise. If you want a very small, portable and stylish camera that shoots good video, does macros exceptionally well, and can handle low light situations, this camera is worth looking into. Having said that, you have to accept that the SD 4000 IS will not produce noise free images, and you'll likely be dealing with some noise even at the lower ISO levels. If that's OK, you'll have a blast with this camera.If you are looking for a DSLR replacement for certain occasions when you don't want to lug around your gear, but also want noise free images in low light, I'm not sure this is your baby. I would rather consider the slightly larger Canon S 90IS, forgo the HD video, and have the manual controls (plus RAW shooting) that the S90 provides.A number of other camera manufacturers are rumored to be releasing more of these types of cameras as the year progresses. It will be interesting to see if any of these can push farther forwards the low light shooting technology, because it's really something we are all wishing for. The SD 4000 IS is a great camera, but it comes with limitations (particularly in the area of noise), and others will be trying to beat what Canon is attempting to do with these portables.Four stars for image quality (but with noise), three stars for price (too expensive, in my opinion), and five stars for quality.Compare:Canon PowerShot S90 10MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCDCanon Powershot S80 8MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle Optical ZoomPanasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black)", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything I've ever wanted in a point-and-shoot", "Author": "M. McCall", "ReviewID": "R34SE68KLI33PS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a point-and-shoot to take on vacation when a photographer I know recommended this new model to me. I was intrigued by the description, because I have a child who does gymnastics and it's virtually impossible to get clear shots in a dark gym where flashes are prohibited. I won't bother discussing the specs since they're all in the product description, but after a week of playing with this camera, I'm simply blown away by the technology. This is, without a doubt, the best point-and-shoot I've ever owned for low light and action shots. Macro shots rival what I can get with my Nikon DSLR-- you can get so close to your subjects that I actually bumped a strawberry with my lens. HD video is impressive as well.Controls are easy to use. The menus make sense, and it only took me an hour or so of tinkering to find everything. The battery is good for about 250 shots on one charge.If there's one negative (so far), it's that the SD4000 is very small and sleek, and I never feel like I'm holding it securely enough. My old A530 was a much more natural fit for the human hand. It's a minor complaint, really, but I have fairly small hands; I imagine it would feel even more undersized to someone with large hands.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Chose this over PowerShot S90 and Cybershot TX5", "Author": "J. Fang", "ReviewID": "R1TS1KA62225H3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I'm a Canon PowerShot fan, owned the SD700IS, SD800IS, SD870IS and now the SD4000IS.  In making this last purchase, I heavily considered the S90 (borrowed a friend's to test), and even the Sony CyberShot TX5.SD4000IS over TX5:Easy win.  Sony has a slimmer profile and waterproof durability, but ultimately those were all gimmicks compared to the picture quality and color.  Reinforced why I always come back to Canon, and reminded me that I wanted an extended warranty this time around.SD4000IS over S90:Tougher decision, but in the end, the S90 is really for the prosumer and those who love all the manual controls.  S90 really make a huge leap with the ring and controls, while the SD4000IS keeps the same repertoire of manuals as previous models (exposure, color, ISO, etc.) which was enough for me, even though I'd classify my use of the manual controls as \"above average\". Also don't tweak pictures more than just what Picasa gives me, so RAW on the S90 was not that important for me, though others have raved about it.Pros+ Video quality: this was the biggest selling point, big step above any previous Canon point-and-shoot video quality.+ Video zoom: Previous Canons only had digital zoom in video (worst ever--you'd zoom in to see something clearer, and it just made it more pixelated and unclear), but SD4000IS now has optical. Other reviews complained about lens noise captured on the audio, which I also experienced, but it was just a very low mechanical hiss, enough to hear if you're listening for it but not enough for a \"what the heck was that??\"+ Low light: a BIG upgrade from my previous Canon models, I was surprised how much better they really are with this new processor and lens+ Wide angle: Wider than S90, about the same as SD870. Great especially because my wife and I still do the whole taking pictures of ourselves by ourselves thing.Cons- No flash level setting, which was the coolest thing on the S90. Don't think any other PowerShots have that either.- In streamlining the camera buttons in the back, the interface is not as straight forward as previous models.  Feel like I'm often adding one more click for every option I'm trying to get to, but not a big deal.- LCD screen is widescreen, which means you have the black side margins when in camera mode (as opposed to the video mode which is full widescreen), and that makes the viewable space a bit smaller than a 3\" display. Not a big deal either for me.- No miniHDMI cord providedOther- Some complained about slow focus, which I did notice it slightly but it's not like I'm a photographer for the NFL.  For regular shots, even with toddlers, I've been fine with it.- Get an extended warranty. It wasn't out of choice that I've had 4 Canons in the last 4 years.  But in all fairness, I don't carry my camera in a case; I carry it around a lot and often in my pocket, but I never drop it either.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sd4000IS- Great camera, tested for blur, no issues.", "Author": "AA", "ReviewID": "R23TWUHB4WF7JX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as the best option (for me) among the ~300.00 P & S cameras.  The most important factors for me-1) Low light.  The reviews all over the internet that rated this camera unusually good for low light pics were correct.  You can take pics indoors without flash- they look great, much more natural than with flash.  It is a major plus and none of the other cameras in this range were capable.  The sacrifice for low light performance at this price point was zoom range- it's not a monster zoomer but it is decent and I'll take the low light capability any day.2) Wide angle.  I like wide angle viewing for architecture pics.3) Canon history.  Canon has been a rugged, reliable camera brand for my entire life as a serious casual photog.4) Portability.  I'll take this camera everywhere.  I have large hands but have no issue with any of the controls.Since there is a vocal minority of people that experienced blurry pics when at full optical zoom, I just benchmarked the performance in my yard.  Pics at full optical zoom appeared very sharp on my computer when viewed at full widescreen size on my computer.  Even zooming in to 100% of image (you get a small fraction of the pic on your screen- use irfran view or other photo viewer that measures percentage of image size when viewing) the images was not razor sharp but was still usable and did not fall off that drastically from the non-zoomed setting.  This is not a professional camera but I am very happy with the results.  In short, I could not duplicate the blurry zoom issues even when zooming in on the picture with my computer image viewer.The 4 star rating was vs. a comparison to a professional camera as a reference, in other words, 5 star image quality is achieved only with cameras costing much more.The controls are also very easy to use once you go through them a few times.  The rotating selection ring works well.  I prefer this over a touch screen.If you value portability, solid feel, sharp images and natural indoor pictures without flash that can only be obtained with a camera that has great low light capability, this one is for you.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon S90 or SD4000?", "Author": "SanjeevP \"Bottom Line\"", "ReviewID": "R34FQ5F3FKKG4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As of July 2010, Canon S90 and Canon SD4000 are two of the best pocketable point and shoot cameras. Tough choice. Having used both, here is my take on these two excellent cameras:ADVANTAGES OF S90 Over SD40001. Better picture quality.2. Lots of manual controls.3. Can capture images in RAW mode, allowing you lot more editing and image manipulation options.ADVANTAGES OF SD4000 Over S901. HD video recording.2. Slow motion video recording.3. Some extra image effects like miniaturization and fish eye.4. Slightly smaller size.5. Native Eye-Fi support. But Eye-Fi card also works in S90.6. I found a little better low light performance.If you are looking for an excellent still image point & shoot camera and do not care that much about HD video then go for S90, which is really a prosumer camera designed for advanced amateur. But if you want an all in one, simple to use camera with ability to shoot good still pictures and HD video, then SD4000 is your camera.UPDATE September 4, 2010: For eighty more bucks, you can have it all in Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch inch LCD which takes HD 720p video and has been just released.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very promising but poor image quality", "Author": "Peeeeter", "ReviewID": "RB06D7LP0V3C8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Two weeks before the S4000 came out, I had purchased the SD1200. I waited for the SD4000 and planned to return the SD1200. How did it compare? First the pros:- SD4000 is extremely sharp at wide-angle from center to edge (much better than SD1200 and SD850)- ISO400 and 800 are indeed very usable (great improvement over SD1200 and other compacts)- nice screenNow the cons:- when zooming in to 3.8x, the picture quality was extremely soft. Or in plain english: not sharp. To be clear, I did not have to crop to 100% to see it or do a side-by-side comparison. And I'm not talking about digital zoom either. Simply looking at the picture left me stunned: soft, blurry, not sharp, simply awful. I increased in-camera sharpness, but that was not nearly sufficient. It was REALLY BAD.- it's not as compact as you might like (pretty long and think, the SD1200 is much more compact)- as other reviews also mentioned, the buttons and menus make navigating cumbersome (many steps with a small super-sensitive dial).Since the pictures at 3.8x were completely unusable, it was a definite no-go. To my big surprise, I kept the SD1200 although I'll miss the wide-angle and high ISO quality of the SD4000. Maybe it was a bad copy?! Note there is another review here that complained about softness, so it does not seem to be unique.I'll try another copy later when the price has dropped and Canon has more experience with it.Bottom line: I give it one star because the camera was simply unusable. As indicated, other features were good to great, but having to return a camera is not worth more than one star in my opinion. It's the first time I returned a camera (and I own 6! 2SLRs, one 12x zoom, 3 compacts).UPDATE:Some people suggest I had a bad copy, others thought I used digital zoom. Quality is very subjective and I therefore quote the professional review from DPReview: \"For the most part, the SD4000 IS produces very nice images. They don't hold up to very close scrutiny at the pixel level - even at lowest ISO there are slightly unpleasant artefacts if you zoom too much. ... But viewed as standard sized prints or at screen resolution (which we believe will be the main use of this camera's output), they look good, with great color rendition and generally good exposure.\"I agree with their opinion (they are obviously more gentle with their choice of words). So, as long as you do not view pics at 100%, you might not notice the bad image quality at 3.8x zoom much. In real life however, everytime you do feel the desire to use the 3.8x zoom to bring a subject up closer, it's quite likely you are tempted to look at the picture up close, or zoom in a bit. Not a good idea! Therefore, if you expect to regularly use the 3.8x end of the zoom, I strongly recommend not to buy this camera. Otherwise, it's a fine camera.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "bottom side is not completely flat", "Author": "Tempuraki", "ReviewID": "R2F25N0YR3KBUU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice compact camera.

I'm happy to report that all three features deliver as promised.I've previously owned about 8 models of Canon cameras in the last 10 years, and my wife wanted to know what this camera could do that my Rebel T1i and Powershot SD870IS could not. She was skeptical, but it only took one movie of the kids jumping on the bed in slow motion to justify the purchase. My only gripe is that one of the things that has drawn me to Canon over the years, the consistent and intuitive menus, has been radically changed.Pros:* high speed movie recording - I know that Casio did it first, but without the Canon quality and Powershot form factor, I was not sold. Both the kids and I love this feature and they enjoy recording themselves to play back in slo-mo. I've been using it to slow down things like water drops and balloons popping.* miniature effect - if you're adept, you can achieve this with Photoshop, but the camera does it MUCH more easily. When it works (when the scene is appropriate) it looks fantastic.* fast lens - as others have commented, you can shoot without a flash in much lower light* 720p movies look fantasticCons:* Menus take a lot \"play time\" to figure out.* Documentation is clear, but lacking depth.

Finding a camera that was both compact, and had the aperture/shutter priority mode was extraordinarily difficult.

So in my mind that only left the Canon S95 and SD4000.  The S95 was more expensive (~$400) and bulky than I was looking for, so all that was left was the SD4000.On the SD4000, the aperture/shutter controls are there, but they are buried deep in a couple menus.  In fact, there are decidedly few physical controls on this camera, so certain camera settings make take a number of button pushes.  Anyone who's familiar with older models of Powershoot or SD Canon cameras may find themselves frustrated by the increased menu-surfing.  All the usual features are there, you just have to go digging for them a bit harder.One glaring problem with this model appears to be its ability to focus in low-light (read: party) conditions.  I estimate this camera misses roughly 1/3 of all shots when shooting at room-to-low lighting, with close subjects, with the flash on, and using the focusing beam.  This is unacceptable.  I have owned several Canon compacts in the past (including a similar-design SD800), and none of them had this sort of difficulty in those conditions.  I actually returned the first SD4000 I purchased, thinking it was defective.  But the second one is just about as bad.  If you plan to use this camera for low-light subjects, I would suggest testing it out first.Otherwise, the performance seems very good.  When the camera does focus, the quality is good for a compact.  Canon's high-ISO, low-light work continues to impress.  I love the wide end zoom (28mm) and wide aperture setting (f/2.0).  Be prepared, of course, for very high barrel distortion at the wide-end, which is common with compacts like this.Battery life seems decent.  Buy a spare.  Flash seems kinda weak but adequate.  There are some neat functions that are new to Canon compacts, such as a high-speed (low res) video mode, which would be neat for sports or maybe macro photography.So then, this is a somewhat-unique camera option, a cheaper-end compact that offers nearly full manual controls.

The price difference between this and the latest in the line is a big factor in choosing this particular model. The positive feedback received by 4000 was better than 4500 with many users wondering why they should even bother upgrading, so 4000 just felt right.The breakdowni) Look & Feel: Form factor of the 4000is and the feel of the camera in your hand is pretty tight. By that, I mean that it fits in the palm of my hand(and buddy its smaller than yours) and I feel pro even with how compact it is.  They sell these in Red, Silver and Black. I went with black because it camouflages against my atypically dark outfits.Iso: The major difference between this and other P&S; cameras is the very nice iso. I was attending a concert by \"Once the Sun\" in a dark room with some impressive lighting effects just a few days after receiving the camera. While standing next to a DSLR holding 'pro', my camera flushed through the darks and lights better than his. I was quite impressed and so were the few standing next to me. Enough that I got the few of them to clear out of the picture zone while my two day old battery charge finally wore down with each click.  The vivid pictures were just right in the dark.Zoom & Stability: This compact has paltry zoom. A 3.8 optical is all this little beast can manage but it manages with a superb stabilization that made me want a larger zoom.  It's great for the up-close venues and close up shots--provided your subject doesn't mind a camera IN their face.  For a 'observer' type of photographer who likes to capture her subjects in candid moments for the more natural shots, I really need more zoom. Even at 3.8 zoom coupled with a 10 megapixel quality, this Canon surprised me.Ease:  This Canon camera powers on instantly. There is no waiting for a splash screen(even though there is one, it's a fraction of a second without loading) or for the system to go through its power-on cycle before you can point and shoot. The power button is also levelled with the camera body, preventing any unnecessary powering in your purse or pocket while you're having your fun. Pressing the power again shuts down the beast almost as immediately as it sprung into action. From there on, it's a matter of pointing, pressing the button and taking a picture. How fast you take pictures depend on how fast the read/write capabilities of your SD card is. I use a class 6 card(I recommend a class 10 for the higher-end dslr models or digital video cameras) and the pictures were saved as fast as I could click.Features and functionality: This is where the pros and cons come into play. In terms of functionality, the Canon SD4000is has too many to list. There are multiple modes to start with from a recording mode, auto mode and a more custom mode. I shot my pictures in custom mode while taking control of the type of setting(which provided a nice iso balance), with features such as smile detection, face recognition all turned on.  The only difference is that I took all of my in house shots with the flash turned OFF! The only mode the flash will remain turned off is Av mode. All the others I have tested proved annoying.And the Flash is where my main gripe stands--I wish the camera would save my flash preference instead of automatically reverting to AUTO mode. This is the only thing I find tedious and to a degree, it affects my overall score of this camera.I do like the ability to quickly turn on my camera and take a shot without worrying about blinding someone unexpectedly. Instead, I have to work my thumb quickly to access flash functions and turn it off before taking my first shot. It's an act that takes a good 2-3 seconds depending on how acquainted you are with the button configuration. Still, I would have preferred it if the camera saved my last flash setting when I power it off. Shutter speed on this is 1 - 1/2500 sec. 15 - 1/2500 sec., with 3.7 shots per second in continuous shooting modes while the more expensive G12 and SX30IS can barely reach 2.0(1.3 in SX30's case.)The Canon SD4000is also has a 720p recording capability. However, you are unable to change the zoom during the recording process. The camera has a built in HDMI port to replay the recording on any HD capable television. The video capabilities are passable but this camera is not by any means advertised as a digital camcorder.The majority of the images I took were at a standard 4-10 megapixel in size. With a 16 GB class 6 card, the camera is capable of taking 7000+ high-quality, A2 print size 10 MP shots.  I have not measured the amount of record time as far as video is concerned.Battery:The battery life on the 4000is is amazing. On a full charge from its compact charger(no cords, just a wall-hugging adaptor with a slot to place the battery in), this camera lasted over 15 hours of usage time in the combination of two whole days. For the avid user who may be out and about without access to a wall-outlet, just two of these OEM batteries will get you through the course of a weekend, provided you partake in sleep.If you're looking for a \"Bridge\" camera between a high-end and costly DSLR and a typical point and shoot camera, this is the right price and this has the right features.  It does not give the zoom of a DSLR, but does have the iso to help you make all the right shots in both day and night. The 10 megapixel quality, the 3.8 zoom and the stabilization offered gives merit to its $220 price tag(average, Amazon.com).  The 720p video is good for quick, fun videos. The overwhelming amount of features attached to every shooting mode is worth a second look.  Play around with one at a local store and see how well you like it before you buy. Or, purchase from a retailer who is willing to refund the item if this isn't your cup of tea.In the end, I returned this purchase to Amazon.com after a week of use. I am a picky customer who NEED a higher zoom for stock images and will be settling for a model that's nearly $400(big price difference). I plan on repurchasing this model later-on for casual to semi-professional use on the go. I suggest this camera to anyone who want more out of their pictures and need a camera that can take brilliant low-light to no-light pictures both indoors and out.(You can view my Once the Sun night/low light shots at [...]", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Prader \"Praderwilli\"", "ReviewID": "R1ARPKBHTHD3TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaces a $400 Canon I bought four years ago.

For instance, my wife was standing on a balcony in the Turks with the sun light behind her.  The camera automatically found her face, focused on that and adjusted the flash to add just enough light to make her the same brightness as the background- the result was a near perfect exposure.

To erase photos takes multiple clicks and gets rather annoying. I'm not convinced the battery life is quite the best. (But then again, I was taking way too many photos and having too much fun with the features.)Pros: I have a Nikon DSLR which I love and take everywhere, but needed to replace my point and shoot. I needed something that had a high ISO, quick shooting, great with low lighting, bursts of flash and the ability to capture vibrant colors.. I take concert photography and it's hard to find a point and shoot with a high zoom, and can perfect all of the above.This camera has the ability to capture great action in low lighting and bright colors.  I've only had it for a few days but I am floored with the capabilities this tiny camera possesses. A great feature it has is the multiple shots that are so quick it almost seems like you are taking video- great for sports. It also has the ability to capture even the tiniest details such as fibers on a pillow.I'm sure upon spending more time with this Canon I will be able to explore more of the features.

If you had one camera to rely to take your backstage access experience at concerts, this is it. (Or any valuable events you want to capture.)I highly recommend this camera to anyone.

I've always had good luck with Canon's so I'm a little biased. That being said, I did a lot of research into other brands before settling on the sd4000. I have a dslr for serious work, but ultimately bought the sd4000 for convenience, something to throw in a pocket, easy enough to for family to quick take shots on auto, and quality to hopefully rival my old s400. I learned through a bit of research that a lot of the newer pocket cams, despite higher megapixels and newer sensors still have a tough time with noise in low light. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the sd4000. Using the low-light mode is hit or miss. It's still easy to get blurry shots when things are moving but most of the time photos in low-light mode are pretty good. After several thousand photos, color accuracy also seems pretty true to the real thing, but still best outdoors. This camera has a great feel to it while taking photos, especially for such a small size. The HD video and slimmer size are what kept me from going with the powershot s90. Suprisingly, I've found quite a few times when the video has come in handy too. Another surprise was how well close up shots turned out. Clear detail at close range. No trouble with speed issues either. Went with a Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory card.

Didn't expect this from Canon.", "Author": "Rahul.", "ReviewID": "R9NICTEV26WQL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "***Please read the UPDATES at the bottom******Initial Review JUNE 2010***After my old Canon started having issues, I had a task of selecting which camera to buy from 3 choices, Sony DSC TX5, Canon SD4000IS, and Canon T2i. My wife ruled out the T2i, as per her she could either handle the T2i or a 5 yr old, not both, and she did not want to carry 2 purses. So I had to rest on the TX5 and the SD4000IS, I picked the Canon.Let me tell you why I did not pick the TX5. I loved the camera, sleek, robust and fast. The features are very good, waterproof, shockproof, lot of shooting styles. Plus it shoots 10 pictures in a second in full resolution which is nice. But the reason I did not pick it is because of the Image Quality. I read a lot of reviews and saw test/comparison images and found out that the Sony takes a little softer pictures. I did not care for the video quality as it was secondary to me.Things that I've experienced with my Canon so far:1. Image quality is superb and outstanding. Although not upto the par to a DSLR, but right there.2. The low light and close up images are awesome.3. Speed. The canon is just as fast as the TX5, but takes less high resolution pictures in a second, about 4 pictures. Which was good enough for me as I didn't want to select the best of 10 images as I would have did in the sony. Canon takes 4 good pictures, which are good enough for me. My son is all over the place and its very difficult to get him in the camera. I could achieve that with the Canon. The shutter lag is very less, 0.4 seconds. Plus Canon takes less time in storing the images to the memory card (I'm using SanDisk Class 10 8GB Card), than which the sony takes. Until the Sony can save all the 10 images, canon could be ready to shoot more images. So if you see the number of pictures shot per second they can be almost the same as Sony. Canon also has a low resolution high speed shooting, about 8 pics per second. They are good if you shoot in good light.4. Videos are good and look very good on HDTV.5. I liked the black matte aluminum finish6. Liked the Program and Auto modes, both get very good pictures. Program mode is very customizable.The things I don't like about the canon:1. The wrist strap, should be at a different place. when I'm trying to download images to computer the strap gets tangled while opening the slot door. Poor design.2. Price, could be less.3. The features are less than the TX5. But thats ok with me.4. High speed and continuous shooting don't do good in low light, normal light pictures are very good.5. More Zoom please.Few suggestions that I've for anyone buying this camera, get a good memory card, not a cheap one. Sandisk Class 10 cards are fantastic. Also get a spare battery, you never know when your need one...Menus are not that bad, as this is a point and shoot, didn't have to do a lot of menu settings, unless you want to do something crazy with the images.Finally, if you want all the good features then go for the Sony TX5 or TX7, but if you want good image quality go for the Canon SD4000IS.***UPDATE 1 OCT 2010***I returned this camera to amazon after 6 months. The camera started having issues with focusing, especially during taking videos. The focus kept on going in and out, which resulted in blurry videos.Amazon took it back without any questions asked. But one thing I hated was they did not refund all my money back, which sucks.I'm still rating this camera 5 stars for the picture quality.Anyways I'm in hunt for another camera. I still keep on getting back to SD4000, as I loved the camera. If I don't find any other alternative before christmas then I will buy it again, till then...search.***UPDATE 2 DEC 2010***I bought the camera again. Didn't find any other camera up to par of this one. Got a good deal from Amazon. Hope this one works better.***UPDATE 3 DEC 2010***I returned this camera to amazon after 10 days, again. I feel so bad. The camera started having issues with focusing, taking normal pictures. The focus would lock and show that it has focused, but the picture on the screen was all blurry. I would have to shut off and restart the camera back again to get it working properly (Question came to my mind, is Canon using Microsoft OS by any chance? LOL) The focusing issues during videos also stayed. The focus kept on going in and out, which resulted in blurry videos.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!

Sure my old Nikon D5000 took far more detailed and super smooth looking pics, even in low light, but now I feel that the best camera is the one you have with you and this one's not bad at all.Features I like about the SD4000 IS are:- Low light performance- 240fps slow motion mode- 720p HD video w/stereo sound- 8.4fps Burst mode- HDMI output- Nice case with grippy texture- Mine was Made in Japan (woo!)- LOL'ing at giant DSLR people taking the same pics as me, while they  brag they spent $3000I realize the new SD4500IS model came out with 10X zoom, 1080p and a dedicated video button, minus the f/2.0 lens (thanks to that guy who updated his review!) but I just liked the way the SD4000 looked better and it was cheaper AND it has the f/2.0 aperture lens.  Well, that and I had already placed my order and am too lazy to exchange it.If there's anything I'd add, it would be a dedicated video button and HDR capability that's all the rage these days.  Overall, the SD4000 IS's picture quality is good, it's pocket-sized and it's very easy to use.UPDATE: (03-28-2011) Battery life is good, but the battery life indicator is kind of useless (especially with video) as it goes from 3/3 bars to flashing 1/3 bars \"low\" without warning.  It's like fuel gauge that goes from full to empty with no steps in between.  I wish it was a percentage thing instead.  On another note, videos recorded in low light play ok in the camera, but are almost completely dark when played on my mac or even my PC, but it could be some monitor setting.

I originally purchased it through Amazon at the end of October.  I liked the form factor, the way the finish was almost like a fine grain sand paper which kept it from slipping out of your hands, but I began to notice that there was a focusing issue.  Before I go further, let me say that while I am by no means a professional photographer, I took photography classes for two years and am pretty adept at it.  Most of the photos I take are of my friends when we go out at night, and being that I was getting it right before the holidays, I knew I'd be taking pictures at many holiday-related gatherings at night.The problem that arose was the the camera had trouble focusing in low light situations.  By this I mean anything from zero light to candlelight to indoor halogen lighting at night.  I'd say about one in every 10 pictures was blurry.  I imagined it was a malfunction/manufacturing error, so I exchanged it through Amazon for another one.  Unfortunately, this one had the same problem and it was actually much worse.  My office had a holiday party last weekend and my coworker used my camera the whole night.  At least 50% of the photos came out severely blurry.  They were not slightly out of focus there were only blobs of color.After looking at other user comments on Amazon and other websites, it became apparent that this is something happening to other people as well.My second one is now in a UPS box awaiting a refund.

(June 4, 2010) This silver camera is built beautifully and looks awesome. The shiny metallic hue of the body makes it look way much better than the pictures shown on both the Amazon and the Canon's websites. Regular photos just can't catch the beauty of this baby. The lines and curves of the body and the overall shape are just a piece of art. It weighs a little heavy. But it feels solid. I guess the body is built with stainless steel not plastic.  The unit is pretty small and real compact. For exterior appearance, it is obviously of high quality workmanship. I just fall for it.After charging the battery for two hours (fully charged), I played with it a little and still on the learning curve to make best use of it. I don't have any comments yet except that the camera feels very warm on the left side after taking a few photos and videos. The other side where flash light is appears OK. I took out the battery, it feels hot as well. I'm not sure if the heat will cause any problem in the future.The Amazon's weight information is way off. I measured with the battery and memory card in it, it weighs 6.2 oz. The physical size is 3.83\" long x 2.16\" tall x .83\" thick.The glass of LCD is measured at 2.81\"x1.54\" with a diagonal of 3.17\". However the viewing area is a little smaller and measured at 2.62\"x1.45\" with the maximum viewing diagonal of 2.96\" or so called 3\" LCD.As the LCD is in 9:5 wide format, most of the time the viewing area for shooting is only 1.96\" wide x 1.45\" tall in the 4:3 format. So in most cases, the viewing area is only 2.44\" in diagonal or equivalent of 2.5\" LCD.The options in shooting sizes are L, M1, M2, M3, S, and W;L is for the largest size at 10M of 3648x2736 pix for printing size up to sheet A2 or 16\"x20\".M1 at 6M of 2816x2112 pix for printing size up to sheet A3 or 13\"x19\".M2 at 4M of 2272x1704 pix for printing size up to sheet A4 or 8.5\"x11\".M3 at 2M of 1600x1200 pix for printing size up to postcard size.S at 0.3M of 640x480 pix for sending e-mails as attachments.W as for wide screen at 7.5M of 3648x2048 pix for printing wide format photos and for viewing on HDTV.In the above listed 6 available shooting sizes, only the W-size has the full viewing of the 3\" LCD. All others will only have 2.5\" LCD for live viewing during shooting.In reviewing photos that previously shot, you will have again 2.5\" viewing areas for all photos except the photo was shot in W-size. Of course, if you zoom in, the photo increases its size to fill the entire 3\" LCD with portion of the photo being cut off at top and bottom. But during shooting, the viewing is still of 2.5\" LCD regardless zoom in or not. The wide screen looks cool. But for practical use, it is smaller than regular 3\" LCD.***************************** Update(June 15/2010) ********************************The panoramic shots are made by stitching multiple shots by Canon's software (which comes with the camera) after photos are uploaded to a computer. Maximum 26 shots can be stitched together. It is more complex and more work than Sony's HX1, TX7, HX5V, or TX5. Sony uses sweeping and automatically stitches all the photos together while you are shooting (like shooting a video) by rotating the camera gently. Sony's are much more user-friendly and straight forward. The Canon's stitching doesn't offer better image qualities than the Sony's. Because the stitching involves different shots of pictures, the stitched image will always have unequal edges along the top and bottom. Therefore, Canon offered a cropping option before saving the merged picture, which cuts off significant portion of the photo at top and bottom in order to have a full panorama without uneven edges.  The Sony takes panorama shots by a constant movement of your hands and automatically stitches all the photos together by the camera during shooting. Thus, the top and bottom edges are smooth and the process is simple and intuitive. In conclusion, Sony won panorama technique over the Canon with hands down. The only better part of the Canon is that it can shot more than 360-degree panorama as long as 26 shots can take, while Sony takes upto 224-degree (HX1), 258-degree (TX7) view of field by one sweeping action.See the attached pictures. The first one is hand held in Auto mode. The camera's automatic set up for this picture are: Tv 1/100, Av 2.8, ISO 125. The picture is better than the one taken by Canon XSi in auto mode. Tiny pollens clearly shown when zoomed in. These pollens are invisible to naked eyes, and barely visible through a regular reading magnifying glass. Canon SD4000IS is amazing! The second picture is a blown up of the first one for three times and cropped in order to be uploaded onto the Amazon.After taking pictures last weekend, what I found is that this camera is excellent or the best in closeup and macro shots. It offers more details than other good cameras. So, if you are in business of selling small items on eBay or a flower lover, it is THE camera for you. However, all other type of shots are just average or above average by not much. The indoor shots are not as sharp as the advertisement stated.The wheel is fun to use. The busting shot combined with contiguous shot option can take pictures continuously as long as you hold down the shutter button. Though pictures are 2.5M each, the total shots can be 30, 50, 100, etc. When you review the shots by either quickly turning the wheel or pressing the forward or backward keys, it was real fun to watch. It's like old movie made by Charlie Chaplin - the cartoon type of motion. It's more fun to watch than regular video shots, especially if you turn the wheel fast to get the pictures in a strip format with the current one enlarged at center of the strip. You could be hooked watching these burst shots in motion!The Sony's can take 10 shots maximum at any single time in burst mode. The rate is a little faster (10 frames per second) than the Canon. Each frame or picture is at 10M maximum, which is better than the 2.5M of Canon. But the drawback of the Sony is that after each burst shot, you will have to wait quite bit for the camera to process the images and to save them. So, during the down time, you could be helpless if something exciting is happening right at the moment. The Canon can have no down time in catching the moment.The Canon's focus is slow. It is most noticeable when shooting videos. The LCD is slow to adjust light conditions to new scene when you move the camera around.  The video is limited to 10 minutes per episode at the finest 720p, while the Sony's are up to 30 minutes per episode at the finest 1080i clarity. Both can zoom in and out during video recording.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "In defense of this discontinued \"overachiever\": Poor man's Sony RX-300.", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R11JOFXOR957KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite highly favorable ratings from Consumer Reports, the SD4000 proved to be a more erratic camera than most Canon Elfs.  Having used a number of them, I can say that the SD4000 is a solid, even heavy, nicely designed machine that works well as a \"role player.\"  Of course, its wide-aperture lens of 2.0 has since been replaced by the Sony RX300's even wider lens.  Still, for low-light, or available light, shots, the SD4000 can hold its own with the best of them, though it would not be my first recommendation as the Elf for all-around, general use.I agree with previous reviewers who have discovered that the manual setting for the Canon SD4000 produces sharper, better-lit photos than the auto setting.  At first I tried the \"aperture priority\" setting to ensure that all of my indoor shots would take full advantage of the camera's ultra-fast f2.0 lens.  But for reasons that elude me, the picture quality I was seeking came only when I selected, from the numerous manual settings, the one called \"Low Light\" (selecting it produces a \"lit candle\" logo in the screen).  After selecting \"Low Light\" from the Manual Settings (the middle setting, between Video and Auto) and de-activating the flash, I was able to get one winning shot after another--all at night in a dimly lit funeral home.  Some of the images were of visitors from 6 to 40 feet away; others were of family photos, some in albums and others in glass-covered frames. In almost every instance, the camera delivered a brightly lit (2-3 times the actual illumination), crisp and sharp photo at the setting of aperture f2.0, shutter-speed 1/60. But once again, I'd advise against selecting those settings; instead, select \"Low Light,\" and the camera will make the appropriate adjustments from there (Canon has \"slyly\" slipped this \"dedicated\" auto setting into its manual line-up).  The rest is up to the photographer, not the camera.  If you can keep your fingers off of the zoom, closing the space between the camera and its subject \"manually\" rather than technologically (i.e. walk up to your subject until it fills the frame), you will be rewarded with images indistinguishable from those of the best Canon or Nikon SLR!  (In fact, the small camera's \"enhancement\" of the image is likely to make its pictures seem warmer and more appealing.)As far as Elves go, the SD4000 is slightly bigger and heavier than the Canons I'm used to (an Elph SD780 remains my point-and-shoot of choice).  On the other hand, the most recent iPod Touch 5, though capable of producing stunning images (it can automatically create a flawless composite based on 3 separate images), is simply too light to qualify as a serious alternative for someone who has gone through an arsenal of 35mm rangefinder and SLR cameras (in my case, from a Kodak Pony to an Argus C3 to an Agfa Ambi Silette and finally, to two Pentax Spotmatics, the 2nd coming with a built-in lightmeter!  In fact, the Agfa photos shot in Stockholm and Paris are so good I'm tempted to look for a used Ambi-Silette on eBay, though the first Spotmatic, with a matching Pentax meter mounted on top, proved better at documenting the activities of human beings working, performing, and just posing, inside or outside, well-lit or poorly-lit conditions.  And I found the 135mm zoom lens (a \"huge\" beast with less power than the 3.8X optical lens of the SD4000) too cumbersome to bother with.  By bonding with the camera, and limiting its field of vision to the space within hand's reach, I was able to make the camera responsive not merely to what I could see but \"feel.\"  As much of a come-down as a small point-and-shoot camera is compared to the old 35mm rangefinder and SLR workhorses (like going from a Colt 45 to a 95-cent plastic air gun UKARMS 1911 Spring Plastic Pistol Airsoft Gun 217AF w/ Laser, Light FPS-160, pretending that an iPod is a camera ranks with the worst of all self-deceptions. I feel like I'm waving a flimsy plastic card in front of the subject--one that should, at the very least, carry the explanatory caption: \"I am a camera.\"  There's absolutely no \"balance\" because there's no weight: consequently, there's no way NOT to shake the iPod while depressing the \"virtual\" trigger on its screen.

I just go to a lot of concerts and love getting pictures during the event and the 780IS was better for this due to its sensor, I assume.

Without the flash, the shots of still subjects are in focus and very natural coloring.  With natural lighting, the shots are crisp and very balanced.  Beautiful!(2) The burst picture mode is very good.  This has come in handy at places like Sea World and our kids' activities when you want to get a good shot but they're moving like crazy.

But the gold rating to Canon sd4000 at  changed my mind and after looking at some sample photographs of both these cameras, I have to say that SD4000 has better image quality than ixus300 even though it's a year old release. One limiting factor is that SD4000 doesn't have 1080p but only 720p compared to the latter but that hardly matters. If you want a Full HD movie, better get a camcorder. But the video quality is fantastic for 720p and also there's a very fun added feature of 240 fps movie mode in 240p resolution. Extremely fast and good for capturing super fast actions.But the best thing is the low light/high ISO image quality. There's no other camera in market at the moment that, for 215$, would have better or even equal image quality at high ISO. Do not expect miracles here, because there's definitely distortion, and noise even at 400ISO when you compare to mirrorless and DSLR alternatives but for a compact camera you can easily carry everywhere in your pocket, it's a remarkable result.The ease of use is remarkable. Maybe one limiting factor is the limited manual tweaks when compared to other canon powershot but there is still some control over basic use such as exposure, ISO setting, shutter speed, infinity/point focus, macro etc which is pretty much standard these days. Some user would definitely miss the dial mode that is also present in other digital cameras of Canon, panasonic, Nikon but all in all, the camera is extremely easy to use and also extremely fast in capturing photographs (I think I read burst mode runs at 3.7 fps but not sure). The time from taking the camera out of pocket, switching it on and taking a photograph would be something like 3 seconds only.You cannot control the intensity of flash (compared to other powershots) so occasional overexposure may result.

This camera just did not live up to expectations, or what was promised by Canon.  First and foremost, I got a lot of odd looking colors in my shots.  Some looked fine, but others looked \"cartoonish\".  I was using the complete auto mode, so it's not like I had the wrong settings picked.  I mean I would hand the camera to a friend, they'd look at the screen and say \"why does she look like a cartoon in this one?\"  Just not natural and not appealing.  I also experienced autofocus issues where more shots were blurry than with my previous Elph. The lack of sharpness was a big issue on most prints. Just too soft and fuzzy. I agree with taking 14 megapixels and going down to 10 to make the photos easier to handle and store, but not when it affects picture quality to this degree. Maybe 12 was a safer number.  Still, 10 megapixels and you can't get a nice sharp 4x6 print out of it?  That just shouldn't be happening.  As far as video goes, I also had a focus issue at times with a moving object. My son was running around the backyard catching lightning bugs and I lost the focus a number of times and had to move the camera around to jar it back into clarity.

Beyond this, I didn't find the bells and whistles to be much of an improvement over the five-year-old Canon digital camera it replaced.
