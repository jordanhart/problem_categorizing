Also, it's meant to hold upright like a phone which completely eliminates it's camera-like qualities. You also have to put in a memory card to store all of the information, and when you take it out then put it back in, the camera doesn't show any of the pictures you took. It's completely terrible in even the slightest dark, and it doesn't have much zoom, either.I wish I had gotten a decent $50 camera instead of this one.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cameras for the price", "Author": "Ila W King", "ReviewID": "R18R3V6JK7FJJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought three of these for our grand-kids to use while visiting us. They had a ball taking videos and still pictures. We took them to places kids ordinarily wouldn't care for, but were educational for them. They took hundreds of pictures to show their parents. One set of batteries lasted them all weekend, which surprised me because they were constantly snapping pictures and then viewing them.For the price you don't get the best resolution and all the fancy features, but they were great for out grandchildren.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "looks good but function is for children", "Author": "oliverfriendlydog", "ReviewID": "R3MGS5Y0RSCEGL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is a starter camera for kids. we bought it for business, but not useful as i thought it would be, too bad.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Bonnie G", "ReviewID": "R237UD7R853Y6A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera only lasted less then a week after giving it as a gift for my daughter.

The problem is the batteries will not support this function. Forget about using rechargeable batteries, they will not work at all. If you use non rechargeable batteries the video function works for almost two minutes then you get the F symbol, that F informs the user the batteries are low, to low to run the video mode. I used three types of new batteries and they just are not enough to run the video mode. My estimate is: four double AA would have been enough to run the video mode. Two AA batteries is a poor engineering design. My suggestion is: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Digital Camera", "Author": "Omo West", "ReviewID": "R2JB9P6CQVUEY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son in elementary school for Christmas.
