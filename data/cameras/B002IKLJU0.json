Holdahl \"GreenShoes\"", "ReviewID": "R3J1Q3V7259NBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a serious amateur, I've been fortunate enough to own a number of point and shoots including Panasonic, Fuji, several Nikon's, & a couple of Canon's.  All have had their strong points and I'm not a brand loyalist by any means, but after a couple of weeks, I must say I absolutely love this camera.My first impressions were ones of pleasant shock.  The camera seemed smaller than in the pictures and if it seemed smaller, it seemed doubly more so in terms of weight.  Compared to my SLR this thing is an absolute lightweight but very well built and certainly heavier than the smaller 'in your pocket' point and shoots. A great balance...although I wouldn't want to drop it.  Some strategically placed silicone on the housing would make this a bit more rugged without much if any impact on cost.  Powerup is about as fast as you can bring the camera up to your face - amongst the best of the point and shoots. Controls are easy to use and I like the mini joystick for making on the fly adjustments in manual and scene modes. The menus are fairly well laid out although some items I had to resort to the manual to find their location for the first time.The iA or Intelligent Auto function gave consistently above par picture quality, although I was always able to tweak it better myself (this could have been as much preference as anything).  The AVCHD and HD movies worked absolutely flawless with my Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]. (NOTE:Make sure you lowlevel format these SDHC cards a COUPLE of times BEFORE first use).  I do wish that you could use the normal shutter release instead of the dedicated movie button on the back face when in movie mode.  I kept forgetting and tried to stop the movies using the shutter button instead of the record button.  Minor nuisance, but will be overcome as I get my brain wrapped around the change in button locations.The battery worked well past 300 stills and about 35 clips, so I am very pleased with it with the LCD display being used for most of the shots.  I purchase another spare battery;Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A Battery, also available here at Amazon, and it appears to be working about as well as the original Panasonic (a great buy).  The EVF or Electronic View Finder was very handy, although most of the overlaid information is very hard to distinguish in the small EVF.  I CAN'T BELIEVE PANASONIC DIDN'T INCLUDE A RUBBER BOOT FOR THE EVF!  Please someone, anyone, make it as an accessory.The EZ or Extra Zoom function is quite handy.  Using this feature, you can shoot at lower resolutions and get more effective zooming power out of the camera...over 30x and it works very well. The LCD screen is clear and crisp, but its performance in high ambient light is about average.  Thank goodness for the electronic view finder mentioned above.Image stabilization is the absolute best amongst my camera collection and is especially noticeable in low light and full zoom. I was pleasantly surprised how well I could take indoor pictures at night with a simple tweak of the exposure.  Far better than any of my other point and shoots, although nowhere near my SLR.The standard 3picture burst mode was fairly standard and unimpressive, but the 10pics per second for speed priority and 6 pics per second in image priority burst mode worked well for catching difficult shots like geese landing on the water and children jumping out of swings, but I still wish the resolution and picture quality was better in these modes.  Still, for a point and shoot, it's ability to catch the fast action is at the top of it's class.The lens cap interferes with zoom, but the camera will kindly remind you that you have left it on with a 17,000 volt discharge...just kidding...it will tell you on the LCD screen.UPDATE: A new megazoom runoff was conducted by Digital Photography Review in June of '07 and can be seen here: [...]  or you can cut to the results here:  [...]To say the FZ35 stacked up well would be an understatement, but as they point out in the above review, you will likely not be disappointed with any of the other fine cameras in the pack. The review, however, will help you to pick one that works best for your needs and preferences. (I'm still super happy and winning contests with my amateur photos).LIKES: Ease of use, picture quality, zoom and extra zoom, HD movie, lightweight, stop action. BEST Point and Shoot I've ever owned ! ! !DISLIKES: (all minor) No eyepiece boot for EVF, lens cap interferes with zoom, tripod mount interferes with battery/memory door when in use. Only 10 sec. max on the built in timer.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Small but Mighty", "Author": "S. Hock \"slhimages\"", "ReviewID": "R2OG8QAGIDT347", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously purchased the Canon SX20is and used 2 weeks. I found the images just a bit too soft for my taste. Too bad because all other facets of the camera was great. But, to me image quality is everything. If it can't produce a crisp image, I don't want it. Perhaps I was spoiled by the excellent SX10is I was switching from.Desperate for an inexpensive Hi Def video camera for a client project, I decided to give the dual Panasonic FZ35 a try. I had used a Panasonic LX2 for several years and liked it, so I figured why not even though Panasonic is not a manufacturer one would normally think of first for a high quality still camera.So far, I have been pleasantly surprised!What I like about the FZ35:1. The super sharp Leica lens! Having 18x zoom in such a small package.(Sharper than SX20is)2. Metal tripod mount3. VERY Reasonable price for all the features included. Seems a bargain to me.4. The fact you also get very nice HD video in one package is a bonus.5. Excellent macro mode. If you like macrophotography you'll like this camera.6. Relatively simple controls/interface once familiar. (You do have to read the manual)7. Has 46mm filter threads for add ons.8. Full time battery indicator.9. Optional wide angle and telephoto lenses are available if desired.10 Better than most image stabilization system.11. Many focus & exposure options.What I'm not so crazy about:1. Buttons & switches are quite small and seem rather delicate.2. Manual as PDF (what a pain). I'll take mine paper, thank you.  You might as well print it out right away. You're gonna need it!3. Smallish Electronic ViewFinder (Not just this one either. They all leave me wanting.)4. Construction and light weight give a slight feeling of cheapness.5. Proprietary Panasonic battery.6. Location of media card in battery compartment.Is it perfect? Nope. Are any of them? Even the $5,000 ones?What do I miss most when switching from my NIKON? That bright, super clear viewfinder.Will it clip highlights? Sure, if you don't set it up right. They all do. High dynamic range is not usually a feature on most consumer cameras.Can it take a sharp picture? You Bet! In macro especially, you'll love the clarity of the image.Newbies purchasing this ... make no mistake, this is a complex little piece of gear. Sure, you can use it on intelligent AUTO if you want, but what a waste. You have to LEARN this camera to get the most out of it. And don't expect to learn it in a day or even a week. Used properly it will yield beautiful, sharp images. Buy it and shoot, shoot, shoot and you'll get the hang of it. Why not? The \"film\" is cheap!By the way, purchase a Class 6 SD card right away. That way if you want to play with the HD movie function you can. Some cheap SD cards can't write fast enough for HD video use. If you have a hi def TV you'll love it.Beware though, HD video files get HUGE fast! Uploads to YouTube (or anywhere else) can take quite awhile. A 1 minute, 36 sec. clip equals 491 MB and over 4 hrs to upload via DSL.If you get serious about HD video, or enjoy doing critical focus photography, PLEASE, buy a decent tripod and USE it. Camera movement is the main enemy of sharpness. At the low ISO settings required to get the most out of these small sensors, keeping the camera still is extremely important. Don't expect stabilization systems to entirely solve \"jitter\" problems at very low shutter speeds!High end users take note: In the Custom controls there is an separate adjustment for contrast, saturation, noise reduction and sharpness. YEA ! Somebody is listening.Nov. 5, 2009. I've made nearly 1000 shots with this camera and I'm impressed and still very happy with it.October 2010, I've made thousands of images and still am impressed by its sharpness. The price has dropped to under $300 now and I consider this an excellent buy. The sharpness of this camera is the standard to which my next one will be held. Image quality is hard to beat for the money.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "First impressions of the DMC-FZ35", "Author": "Michael A. Duvernois", "ReviewID": "R3ILKMF8CV1JYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first of the Panasonic Lumix superzooms that I've had an opportunity to use extensively. I regularly use both small point and shoot digital cameras (Canon SD550 and a waterproofed Canon S100) and digital SLRs (Canon 5D and Rebel XTi), but this is definitely a different sort of beast. It's nearly the size and weight of a DSLR with a lens that is noticeably long in use. It's sold as straddling the line between the two categories and it initially seems that way. But the more that I think about it, the more I think this camera really fills a different niche. If you're a serious photographer, a DSLR is really the way to go. You get full control over the images, a large sensor size, a selection of lenses, and filter options. If you're that person, this is hardly a replacement, and for the compact point and shooter this is a massive camera. Where this camera wins out is for a very simple kit covering wide angle (27mm equivalent for a 35mm camera) and the stunning 18x zoom. You'll be able to do most everything passably with this camera and with no additional lenses. Maybe this is the camera to put in the glovebox of your car? It'll always be there, and you can get most any shot with it. No preparation needed. Okay, enough thinking about who wants the camera, how does it work?Well, it works pretty darned well. The image stabilizer seems to work extremely well, especially at moderate zoom (say 50-150mm equivalent), the battery lasted about 300 shots with some flash use in there, and image quality (subjective, not measured scientifically) was quite good. The camera was a bit slow to react at times though and the face detection works only occasionally. Still, that leaves this a solid camera for what I think is a quite good price. If you're not going to take advantage of the DSLR capabilities, this is a good functional camera for you. Or an excellent second camera for simplicity.Pros: 18x zoom with a genuine wide angle, solid construction, good battery life, image stabilization that works, one size might well fit manyCons: big for a point and shoot, slow acting at times, gimmicky features are, well, gimmicks", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very promising", "Author": "Peter Biddlecombe \"peterbiddlecombe\"", "ReviewID": "R2AKTZAQVY5CAJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(Copy of a review posted on the UK site - this is the FZ38 over there)This is an initial review after one day of ownership, which I'll revise. My previous experience of digital cameras is limited to a Nikon Coolpix compact, now about 7 years old, and this camera is intended to replace the Nikon film SLR and three lenses which I've lugged around on holidays for 10-15 years. So some things that are amazing me will be just what you expect if you're used to similar cameras.From that standpoint, the first thing to amaze me is the weight. Complete with battery, SDHC card, lens cap, lens hood and shoulder strap, it's 1lb 1oz on the kitchen scales. And there's very little to add in the accessory line - a clear and polarising filter (unlike some 'bridge' cameras, this one has a filter screw thread), spare battery, blower brush and mini-tripod from old stock and a new bag, and we're done. This probably means the full kit weighing less than the SLR with mid-range zoom.One reason for persevering with the SLR was being able to use an 18-35 mm lens for wide-angle shots. As the wide end of this camera is only equivalent to 27mm, I was pleased to see the panorama assist facility, and will be testing out the \"stitching\" software supplied with it to see whether I can still get a picture of a cathedral from the square in front of it. (An initial experiment suggests that given a level tripod, some good results should be available). At the narrow end, you don't get the same power as the 24x or 26x alternatives, but with my previous range of 18-300mm, I used the 300 end less often than the 18, so probably not a big issue unless you're snapping birds or cricketers. (You can have 32x if you reduce image size to 3Gb, but a very quick comparison suggests that unless stuck for memory space you may as well use 18x/12Mb and crop the picture later.)The next big surprise was the quality of the results from \"Intelligent Auto\" mode. As soon as the battery was charged, I went outside and snapped away without worrying about where the sun was, or anything else I'd have pondered with the SLR. Results were very good, so you can do some very lazy photography, and if one or all users of the camera have never cared about shutter speeds and exposure compensation, it barely matters - Intelligent Auto and some other top-wheel choices like the scene mode will do most of the work.I haven't yet tried the movie-making side, though that's not of great interest to me.Various minor points:The supplied Photofun Studio 4 software says that it doesn't support 64-bit Windows Vista, but does install and seems to work OK.You do NOT get a printed copy of the full manual, just a short 'Getting started' guide. The full manual in PDF is supplied on CD and you can find it and read it on the Panasonic website before buying, but I would have liked to have to whole thing - spare time on holidays is an ideal time for reading it. As and when we have a netbook PC for keeping and editing pictures, this issue will disappear!The lens hood is easy enough to fit but its guide mark is unhelpfully placed on the bottom of the camera and common-sense fitting by eye without inverting the camera works just as well. The lens cap fits on the screw-in ring to which you attach the hood, though I've not yet checked whether you can stick this whole lot in front of a lens-protecting filter without vignetting or other trouble.The square \"+/-\" symbol on the display may cause mild panic if you're used to an old SLR's top-panel display, where the symbol itself indicates under/overexposure. On the FZ38, it doesn't unless there is a number next to it. The display options are worth exploring - the guidelines option is a boon for lining up, and when displaying pictures, you can optionally show a lot of information like shutter speed and aperture. Another user interface issue is that some selections are made without the equivalent of an \"OK\" button and some with, so at first you may find yourself pressing the \"Menu/Set\" button too often, despite the camera's efforts to guide you.One problem with the user interface is more significant - some lists of option choices use graphical symbols whose meaning may not be obvious. In some cases (like the ones shown when you select portrait with the mode wheel) these have explanatory captions (my favourite is \"Smooth skin - shoot potrait's skin more smoothly\" - misspelled and a bit repetitious, but they tried). In others, there's no help - try Setup - LCD mode, where your choices are \"Off\", \"A*\" and \"*\" with no help about what LCD mode is or what these settings mean. You have to go to the full manual in PDF to find out. Depending on your experience, other symbols may be obvious, and explanation might be irritating, so there's probably scope for some kind of \"expert/beginner\" setting which determines how much is explained. This is the one that stops me upping the rating to five stars.The electronic viewfinder works well as an alternative to the screen, once adjusted with the diopter wheel. The display is exactly the same - you can even look at your stored pics with the viewfinder.The battery is good for 470 shots based on the CIPA standard, but the manual warns you that this is based on a particular usage pattern - \"e.g. when recording once every 2 minutes, the number [...] decreases to about 117. So a spare battery is probably worth buying. The charger is good for voltages 110-240, so for foreign trips you only need the kind of adaptor that makes the plug fit.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good camera for the money; very convenient to use", "Author": "Cop3 \"Rock and Roll for the People\"", "ReviewID": "RPZAIX76QZKYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the FZ35 for about 3 weeks now.  I have found nothing of substance to gripe about yet.  The camera has a lot of features and since I have a day job it will take a while to really learn how to get the most from this camera, but the effort is worth it.  Getting started is easy with the simple booklet that comes in the box; yes, it would be nice to have the entire manual in print but I downloaded to my laptop and read a little more each week as I fiddle with the camera, so slowly but surely I'm getting the big picture, so to speak, of how to operate the fz35.I finally got around to using the supplied video cables tonight and learned I could hook the camera up to the hdtv.  This past Sunday morning was sunny and inviting so I went into the yard and took pictures of flowers and assorted closeups mostly, in the fish pond, butterflies, even a hummingbird, using the different settings and priorities, the flash, and so forth.  Tonight I watched a slide show of all the pictures on my hdtv, complete with music (it's programmed into the camera in several different styles).  The picture quality on the tv was incredibly good; several photos were extreme closeups of a butterfly on the ground and the particles of dirt below the butterfy's wings were clearly visible on my 37\" screen.Picture quality and features aside, this camera is easy to use for the beginner who can gradually improve their skills by using the shutter speed/aperture priorities or manual mode, or automatic, or choose one of the many scene modes depending upon the situation.  The camera boots up quickly and the delay between shots is acceptable, if not blazingly fast. (There is a setting for taking several shots in quick sequence, if needed.) The flash is strong and recycles fairly quickly.  the camera won't fit in your pocket unless you're Captain Kangaroo, but with its accessories it'll fit into a small camera bag.  I purchased the wide angle and exta zoom lenses because they came on sale, but really, you don't need them given the range of the supplied Leica lens.  The controls are fairly easy to use and intuitive; I really like the design of one convenient button to toggle directly back and forth between the lens finder and the lcd screen on the back of the camera; all digital cameras don't feature that.Sure, not much is perfect in life, but this camera is close enough for me..", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lumnix fz35", "Author": "M.

I find the fz35 to be a great point and shoot super zoom. I shoot one-handed often so a regular DLSR is not really useful to me. The fz35 is very easy to use one handed, all the controls are very convenient (if you are right handed that is). It has a remarkable lens and produces a great picture.  The only drawback I can find to this camera is its somewhat poor low light/high iso capabilities.  I personally find anything above 200 iso to be unacceptable, the grain is very noticeable. It is programmable to limit the iso to various ranges and when shooting between 80 and 180 iso, the images are exceptional.  The autofocus is quick and manual mode is very flexible.

All of the positive points of this camera have been covered in other reviews, it is an excellent choice. My husband and I chose this as our new family camera to have manual and automatic abilities for our family photos, and to be able to shoot HD music videos (former filmmakers who have sold all our official equipment).Please make sure, if shooting HD video, that your location is well lit. The graininess of indoor home movies is much more apparent on a big ol' HD tv! if you have good lighting, this won't be an issue.I have spent a lot of time with the digital manual, and i simply cannot replicate the indoor afternoon light/no flash automatic photos i used to take with my 7 year old canon point and shoot. Using the iA (intellegent auto, this camera's point and shoot mode), daytime indoor/no flash photos are desaturated, full of color noise, and hard to get in focus without a tripod. I would expect this from a night time room with lights on, but not from a well-lit living room during the day. I had read about low-light issues with this camera, but am disappointed it is not even comparable to my old basic P&S; Canon. If you read this and have advice, please comment. Luckily, the built in flash is a triumph above my old camera, it is the \"kindest\" and least harsh flash I've ever used.Those are the two points I wish I'd understood before buying this camera. I love it on the whole, and find navigating through the menu very easy. My outdoor photos are simply gorgeous for a p&h; sensor. I ordered the Tamrac 3535 Express 5 Camera Bag and it is just the right size to carry the camera and basic accessories on a daily basis. Tamrac 3535 Express 5 Camera Bag (Black)GET A CLASS 6 memory card, at least 8 Gigs, if you want to shoot video. Plus the speed of this card makes downloading from the camera to your computer super fast, a perk I wasn't expecting.*UPDATE* after a recommendation from an online photo group for this camera, I switched to using the \"indoor portrait\" mode, and the outcome has been much better than with iA mode. The group members have indicated that this camera was not designed to excel at indoor Automatic captures, but instead outdoor zoom photography (i expected it to do both), and so it needs more information from the camera person. No big deal, switch to portrait and click down to indoor, and the photos have very close to the color and dimension I am used to. You just can't use this for an all around Auto (iA) camera in every situation.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera & Excellent value", "Author": "Charles F Ferrara", "ReviewID": "R1PIAZK7I83TAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I still stand by everything written in this review - this is an excellent camera but, there are newer models out there. I have noticed a few DMC-FZ35's still for sale on Amazon at ridiculously high prices.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 is exceptionally versatile. I am a serious photographer and I was looking for a quality point & shoot that was more portable than an SLR. This camera has filled this need splendidly. Years ago, I would have needed a bag of lenses and a tripod to get some of the shots that it successfully took with little effort.During a recent trip, I put the image stabilization to the test with extremely low expectations. On a very overcast day, I took several fully zoomed telephoto shots of the landscape (at 12 MP resolution) from a moving car - on an interstate. Although a few were blurry, most of them came out exceptionally sharp. I was pleasantly surprised how well the camera held up under these circumstances, where shooting is normally impossible.Another important feature for me is the filter threads (46 mm) so I can use a polarizer on outdoor shots (which is a must for any serious photographer). This was the only camera in its class to offer threads. With most of the competition, only their SLR's offer this. Additionally, a UV filter is always a good idea to protect your lens.There are a few cons, but I consider them to be minor - especially considering the price I paid:1) Vignetting at full wide-angle when using a polarizer. NOTE: I recently solved this problem using the the manufacturer recommended polarizer that was made for this camera (Panasonic DMW-LPL46 46mm Polarizing Filter). I had been using a third party Tiffen polarizer, which was much too thick. The Panasonic polarizer is linear and not circular, but it works fine & does not affect the autofocus. It's also a bit pricey, but it's a safe option.2) Smallest aperture is f/8. A neutral density filter would be needed to slow-down most waterfall shots.3) No bulb setting for night photography4) No hot shoe for flash", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "FINALLY, a camera I can love!", "Author": "Diane K. Miller \"diinIN\"", "ReviewID": "R2XH61LB7WCP5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I finally decided on a megazoom, it came down to the Canon 20is (would have preferred the 10is, actually), and the FZ35.  I was able to have hands on time with the Canon first.  My top priority is picture quality, and it just didn't measure up.  Add to that its lack of filter threads (WHAT??!), no raw format, AA batteries (hate 'em), excessive size and weight, higher price, and past bad experience with a Canon, and I opted to buy the FZ35 sight unseen, risky as that was.  The reviews for this camera are really stellar, and well deserved.Some have said the FZ35 is lightweight, and because of that, feels cheap.  Personally, I don't need for my camera to be heavy/bulky to prove it is quality made--I need it to perform, and this one does. All the extra weight of those cameras that feel more \"quality\" starts to hurt when you've got your arms over your head waiting for your shot.Not many people have talked about the joystick.  I'm a big fan of joystick control, because it puts so many functions at the tip of your thumb, and accesses them quickly without having to move your hands around the camera.  Holding it in briefly gives you the Quick menu, where you can alter the stabilizer, metering mode, focus mode, white balance, ISO, intelligent exposure, file size, quality, and LCD options.  With the camera in Manual Mode, you can change the aperture and shutter speed in a split-second using the joystick.  (Those two parameters are displayed at the bottom of the screen, and I like that shutter speeds less than a second are displayed as a fraction, not as just the denominator of the fraction).  Half-press the shutter, and you get a meter showing over- or under-exposure.  This will slide as you alter your settings so you know where you stand.The manual focus is also done with the joystick, which is unique.  I like that you don't have to remove either hand from the camera in order to focus.  If you need to autofocus for the moment while in manual focus, you just press a little button on top and it's instantly done for you, while still keeping you in manual focus mode.  Nice way to cheat when you're in a hurry.  \u00dcI find the LCD nicely accurate.  On my old Piece-O-Junk Canon, I had to run in and load the pics on the computer to know what they really looked like, and often it was an unpleasant surprise.  It took way too many shots to get a few good ones.  I've had no such experiences with this camera.The battery pack is also a big PRO for me.  Regular AA batteries never quite pulled the weight of my Piece-O-Junk.  A lame camera became even lamer, and I hated dealing with all those AA's.  This nice little battery pack is wonderfully compact, easy to handle, and fits nicely into my camera case (Lowepro AW 160--holds my camcorder too), as does the included charger.Best of all, the picture quality is excellent.  I've taken over 800 pictures with the FZ35, mostly in Manual Mode, and have been nothing short of thrilled with the results.  I've finally got a camera that is a joy to use in so many ways.  The macro mode is incredible, BTW.  I've also gotten good results indoors without flash, but in my dark house that requires manual control and sometimes a tripod (or skip all that and just use the flash).  What this not-so-little gem has accomplished is nothing short of incredible.The FZ35 is so capable and gives you so much control, it's almost a bit of a waste to use it in Auto mode.  I would strongly encourage you to plug thru the manual, buy a book on digital photography if needed, and experiment.  This is a sophisticated camera with many options, some of which you just simply won't discover without reading the manual.I haven't used the movie function at all, so can't comment on that.Sample photos can be viewed at [...].  When viewing a shot, note the camera used in the right column, as my old junk cameras (Canon and Olympus) have shots up there too.  Also remember that I am totally an amateur attempting a little more serious photography.Summed up in seven words, I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy: Yes. Upgrade: Maybe. Limits: Some.  Memory: FYI", "Author": "Morgan Witthoft", "ReviewID": "R135F905I5YA94", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you don't have a good digital camera, this is a fine choice. Quick response, decent quality pictures, easy to point & shoot, the zoom and image stabilization really work. I like the lithium battery - - they last so much longer than AA's. You may prefer AA's for their wide availability.If you already have a good digital camera, you might not find it worth your while to upgrade. My main digicam is five years old now, but darn it, it takes fine pictures. It boots more slowly, it has fewer pixels (but still plenty of 'em), the battery life is not as good, but are those differences really worth $400 out of pocket? That's your personal call. The changes from old to new camera are incremental, not revolutionary. In particular the color and image quality are about the same (my old one is a Fuji Finepix S7000).  Your decision will also depend on whether enhanced movie modes are important to you (and, if so, whether you really wanted to buy a video recorder instead).A couple limitations on the Lumix1. Zoom.  The zoom is nice, and lets you compose some pretty good pictures. However, if it's real nature photography you want - - the bird on the other side of your yard, the mountain goat across the river - - this camera won't do it. You need more power.2. Pixels and focus.  I was hoping I could get the effect of \"yet more zoom\" by cropping down and enlarging just one part of the image. However, the results were disappointing. Partly, you just have to recognize that 12MP is just not a big step up in resolution/enlargeability compared to 3 or 4 (whatever it is) in my old camera. Partly, it seems that my old camera is more supportive of cropping/enlarging without the picture going grainy from loss of resolution. This could be an issue with quality of focus or with the size of the sensor (other users have raised issues about the sensor size - - I don't quite understand it). It was a subtle difference, though. If the Lumix is worse than my Finepix in this regard, it's only a bit worse. But it certainly is not better.3. Manual focus. This was frustrating, because auto focus has the annoying tendency to focus on the one tree branch in the foreground instead of the thing you want to see that's beyond the tree, and manual focus should solve that problem. The Lumix has a manual focus, but there are two big problems with it.a. It uses the joystick (AKA \"wobbly pencil eraser\"), so it's clumsy. (What good is a clumsy manual focus?)b. Manual focus is only available in about half of the large collection of \"modes\", and the documentation seems to be wrong about which \"modes\" support manual focus, or the manual focus intermittently fails to kick in - - it was frustrating and confusing.

All have had their strong points and I'm not a brand loyalist by any means, but after a couple of weeks, I must say I absolutely love this camera.My first impressions were ones of pleasant shock. The camera seemed smaller than in the pictures and if it seemed smaller, it seemed doubly more so in terms of weight. It feels very light but very solid. It has well balanced feel. It Powers up very fast.  It takes about as fast as you can bring the camera up to your face - amongst the best of the point and shoots. Controls are easy to use and I like the mini joystick for making on the fly adjustments in manual and scene modes. The menus are fairly well laid out although some items I had to resort to the manual to find their location for the first time.The iA or Intelligent Auto function gave consistently above par picture quality, although I was always able to tweak it better myself (this could have been as much preference as anything). The AVCHD and HD movies worked absolutely flawless with my Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]. (NOTE:Make sure you lowlevel format these SDHC cards a COUPLE of times BEFORE first use). I do wish that you could use the normal shutter release instead of the dedicated movie button on the back face when in movie mode. I kept forgetting and tried to stop the movies using the shutter button instead of the record button. Minor nuisance, but will be overcome as I get my brain wrapped around the change in button locations.The battery worked well past 300 stills and about 35 clips, so I am very pleased with it with the LCD display being used for most of the shots. I purchase another spare battery;Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A Battery, also available here at Amazon, and it appears to be working about as well as the original Panasonic (a great buy). The EVF or Electronic View Finder was very handy, although most of the overlaid information is very hard to distinguish in the small EVF. I CAN'T BELIEVE PANASONIC DIDN'T INCLUDE A RUBBER BOOT FOR THE EVF! Please someone, anyone, make it as an accessory.The EZ or Extra Zoom function is quite handy. Using this feature, you can shoot at lower resolutions and get more effective zooming power out of the camera...over 30x and it works very well. The LCD screen is clear and crisp, but its performance in high ambient light is about average. Thank goodness for the electronic view finder mentioned above.Image stabilization is the absolute best amongst my camera collection and is especially noticeable in low light and full zoom. I was pleasantly surprised how well I could take indoor pictures at night with a simple tweak of the exposure. Far better than any of my other point and shoots, although nowhere near my SLR.The standard 3picture burst mode was fairly standard and unimpressive, but the 10pics per second for speed priority and 6 pics per second in image priority burst mode worked well for catching difficult shots like geese landing on the water and children jumping out of swings, but I still wish the resolution and picture quality was better in these modes. Still, for a point and shoot, it's ability to catch the fast action is at the top of it's class.The lens cap interferes with zoom, but the camera will kindly remind you that you have left it on with a 17,000 volt discharge...just kidding...it will tell you on the LCD screen.LIKES: Ease of use, picture quality, zoom and extra zoom, HD movie, and stereo sound (the movies look and sound clear and crisp on my HD TV!  It's lightweight and perfect for sports, landscapes, events, close up and macro work, long lens telephoto shots, and portraits.DISLIKES: (all minor) No eyepiece boot for EVF, lens cap interferes with zoom, tripod mount interferes with battery/memory door when in use.

It is my sixth digital camera (not counting camera phones) and is clearly the most advanced, sophisticated, best-photo-taking camera I have used. Most of the time, I don't even take it out of automatic mode, as I like the results so much.I have owned a couple of cameras by Canon (very good, compact size); and a few from Olympus (from one of their first basic ones to the Ultra-Zoom 765); and also another Panasonic, the DMC-FZ8.You can read all the technical details elsewhere. I'll just tell you what a dream it is to use. The viewfinder, which I find essential, is great; the large LCD is even better (although I use it only for viewing shots, not composing them). Ease of use is exceptional, despite the myriad of options. Most are very intuitive and work as expected.Although it uses a dedicated battery pack, they are easy to find, not too expensive, and last for many shots and viewings.The Leica lens is wonderful, providing rich, clear color and balance. It's rated at 18X, which gets noticeably closer than my 10X Olympus, but also zooms out to a 27mm equivalent wide angle, which is handy.You can shoot at the full 12 MP resolution, or save some disk space and shoot at 5 MP. It also shoots HD movies at 720P and boasts stereo mics for sound.I really don't have any complaints about this camera at all. I will confess to not having used all its advanced features yet, and I don't have an HD TV to play back the video, but I'm pretty impressed with everything that this camera can do, especially for the price, which was under $330 through Amazon when I bought it in October 2009.If you want more that a simple point-and-shoot, but don't want to get into the expense and complexity of a Digital SLR, then this is a great choice. I highly recommend it!", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best-in-Class for Point-and-Shoot Cameras", "Author": "CodeWarrior", "ReviewID": "R33YFG97FLNPKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my DMC-FZ35K for about a week now.  I purchased it from Amazon.For the price this is the best camera you can buy.  In fact, if you go to Amazon right now, and view all their point-and-shoot cameras sorted by customer feedback, this one is 3rd on the list and is cheaper and with more features then 1st and 2nd.The picture quality is excellent, also the auto-focus and general shot-firing mechanism is very-fast.  There is a touch of graniness in the scaled-up expanded image when viewing the pictures on a computer (when doing 'view actual pixels' instead of 'fit on screen'), but this is natural and something that is present with all digital cameras (it is not the compression and is still visible if you take some uncompressed pics).  But at 12 megapixels most people viewing your pics will do so scaled down, so it is almost never noticeable.  The only digital cameras that don't have the pixel-level graniness are the DSLR digital cameras and are of an entirely different class and price range.The video quality is actually better than I expected.  The 'AVCHD (Lite)' format is actually x264, a variant of H264, and has excellent compression-to-quality properties (slightly better than MPEG-4 video).  The middle quality setting 'H' provides 11.5 mbit/s bitrate, which is standard fare for 1080p HDTV, making it more than suitable for 720p recording.  In fact, even the lowest quality setting for AVCHD video (8 mbit/s) was excellent.  I don't recommend using the 'MOTION JPEG' format (Quicktime MOV, MPEG-4 encoding), as the lower quality settings actually record at lower resolutions not just in HD at a lower bitrate, and although the highest quality setting records in HD it does so at a ridiculous bitrate of 25mbit/s and takes up twice as much space with no noticeable difference in quality compared to AVCHD highest setting.  In general the videos were of good quality even when in fairly low lighting conditions.  Note AVCHD videos are saved in a different folder than the pictures ... once you find them they play nicely on a computer after installing a free codec pack.My biggest gripe is size of the camera, although it is very light for its size.  The reality is probably that with 18x optical zoom there isn't a physical way to house this camera in a smaller frame, and I can't complain too much because the frame is much easier to grip compared to smaller cameras (and I am never accidentally covering the flash or lens with my fingers as I tend to do with several of the smaller digital cameras).Another thing to note which is true of all new digital cameras, the file sizes are huge.  Each pic compressed is 5 Megabytes and even at the lowest quality setting AVCHD videos still take up 1 Megabyte per second!  Get yourself a 16/32 Gigabyte SDHC card (Class 6 or better speed).The TV playback is great too.  I showed pics and videos at a friends - plug-n-play.  Though you need to buy your own HDMI cable to playback on HDTV, but it is a regular cable so get it at any electronics store.

Umbenhaur \"Video Gaming Ninja\"", "ReviewID": "RDL7Q4FMIFHPF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Panasonic DMC-FZ35, as well as the Canon SX20 IS, so that I could choose which camera I liked best (I have owned a Canon S2IS for nearly 5 years).  After 2 weeks of using both cameras, I chose to continue using the FZ35, mainly because of a preference for the AVCHD Lite (H.264) over Quicktime video format, for the superior image quality and RAW support, and because the camera weighed much less (both cameras were significantly larger than my previous S2 IS).  I have been mostly happy with my decision, but I do have some issues with some of the Panasonic features.Likes:- Terrific 720p HD video quality- Better image quality in all situations- Manual controls are better (in my opinion) possibly because of the \"rubber eraser/joystick\"- More custom modes (three), and good variety of \"scene\" modes- Relatively fast autofocus- 2.7\" LCD is larger and has a better viewing angle when viewed off-centerDislikes (in great detail):- No flip-out/articulating screen (I tried to remedy this by purchasing a Flipbac, which is not nearly as versatile and ends up getting in the way a lot of the time).  The LCD is better, but is still nowhere near the quality of IPS, and looks terrible when viewed at extreme angles (completely avoidable with an articulating LCD).  Panasonic's DMC-FZ50 has such a screen, but is dated and does not have 720p video.- Continuous/burst shooting is severely crippled to a maximum of 3 shots at 12.1MP at 2.3 fps, versus the SX20IS which shoots at only 1.0fps at 12.1MP, but allows an unlimited number of shots.  The FZ35 does have a high-speed unlimited continuous shooting mode if you are willing to navigate to \"Scene Mode->Hi-Speed Burst\" (as it is unavailable elsewhere) and downgrade the image size to 5MP or less, but this is not significantly better than the shooting speed of the SX20 at these low resolutions- The half-press autofocus/autoexposure lock only allows you to take a single shot with the automatically calculated settings, unlike the SX20IS (and every camera I ever touched) which allows you to release the shutter halfway (after taking your first picture) and take additional photos with the locked in settings.  This is an incredible waste of time because the camera must be refocused for each shot even if the exposure/aperture/ISO settings are already perfect.  This can be partially remedied by using the \"AF/AE Lock\" button to lock the settings prior to taking multiple pictures, but sadly this feature does not work in \"Intelligent Auto\" mode, which I use most of the time- Audio quality in movies is not nearly as clear due to microphone placement on top of the flash instead of in front of the camera- Playback mode does not show a preview of each picture when scrolling rapidly (by holding down left or right), however in \"Review mode\" (which is accessible by pressing the \"Fn\" button while in shooting mode only), scrolling rapidly shows EVERY preview picture (it does take longer to scroll).  There should have been an option to change this in the settings.- Panoramic mode is rather limited compared to the SX20 (supports only horizontal/vertical panoramas, and the previous picture is barely visible on the screen as it is too transparent)- No option to hold the captured image on the screen as long as the shutter is fully depressed, the closest option is to hold the image until any button is pressed (but this forces you to confirm every shot before you can take another)I believe nearly all of these issues could be fixed with a firmware update (other than the screen/microphone), which would honestly make this become a clear winner over other cameras in it's class.I look forward to the next generation of ultrazooms, and hope that Panasonic can fix these small issues, which are blemishes on an otherwise stellar camera. 4.5/5.0", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great travel camera", "Author": "D. DEGEORGE", "ReviewID": "R31CAA1T9WI7AV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I get into somewhat gory detail in this rather lengthy review, let me net it out in the beginning: this is an extraordinarily versatile camera of surprising quality for its price. It has enough serious features to merit a 219-page manual (in PDF format, not hardcopy), and yet with the camera in full automatic mode no technical experience is necessary to make outstanding pictures (all that's required is a good artistic eye)--after more than 50 years of photography as a hobby, I am beginning to worry that this camera may be smarter than I! On top of that, it doubles as a more-than-adequate HD camcorder. Photography and videography are two of my greatest motivations for, and preoccupations while, traveling the world; and this camera is the only camera, still or video, that I plan to take on my next trip.Based on numerous reviews by professional critics as well as consumers, I narrowed down my choice of advanced compact digital cameras to two: the Canon Powershot SX20 IS and the Panasonic Lumix FZ35, both superzooms, the former 20X, the latter 18X. As I was in the market for a travel camera, a DSLR or Micro Four Thirds with a set of interchangeable lenses was out of the question--too bulky and too much time switching from one lens to another. The 3X and 4X zooms that are common on point-and-shoot cameras, and often part of the bundle when buying DSLR or Four Thirds cameras, lack true telephoto capability, ranging from weak wide-angle to just barely beyond portrait focal length. Besides at least a 10X zoom, my other inflexible requirement was that the camera have an eyepiece viewfinder in addition to an LCD monitor; and that narrowed the field considerably.There are numerous small differences between the two cameras, and I refer you to the professional reviews to examine all the pros and cons of each camera. Consumer ratings place the two cameras neck-and-neck. My decision came down to choosing between the flip-out, tiltable LCD on the Canon and Panasonic's ability to make photos in RAW format--a very tough choice. I decided on the Panasonic as it seemed to lean a little more toward a photo-enthusiast camera; and there were also minor factors such as its lighter weight (again with travel in mind), its more compact lithium-ion battery versus the universality of AA batteries that the Canon uses, its threaded lens allowing for attachment of any standard 46mm polarizing filter, and Panasonic's use of the AVCHD Lite movie format, which makes it possible to remove the SDHC memory card and play it back directly in a Panasonic Blu-ray player.The plethora of features on the Lumix is mind-boggling, and some are more useful to me than others. One that I was especially happy to find, because it had not been mentioned in the reviews I had read, was its panorama mode. Not only does it provide a superimposed grid to assist one in keeping the successive frames lined up, it puts the relevant portion of each shot into the viewfinder as one is composing the next frame, insuring that one pans just the right amount to provide the correct overlap to allow successful stitching back at the PC, where the bundled software not only does a great job of stitching but also provides a 360-degree viewing mode that is especially cool.Bear with me for what may seem an irrelevant digression, but it pertains to the extraordinary picture quality I am getting from this camera. Once I received it (two weeks ago as of this review) and thus had behind me the choice between direct competitors, my interest turned to whether or not I might be making a mistake if I left my Nikon D50 DSLR and Canon HD30 camcorder at home and only took the Lumix FZ35 on an upcoming trip, putting aside the question of whether or not it would be wise to put all my photographic/video eggs into one basket. This led me to some fairly extensive comparisons between the Lumix and my five-year-old Nikon DSLR, the latter being equipped with a Nikon 18-200mm VR (vibration-reduction) zoom. I wondered if the 4-5-year technological advantage of the Lumix FZ35, including its 12-megapixel format versus 6 megapixels in the Nikon, would make it in any way comparable to the camera outfit that had cost me nearly five times as much. I was especially concerned that 12 megapixels might be nothing more than part of a specifications war and might be rendered completely irrelevant if the lens and focusing system were unable fully to take advantage of the high resolution, because, as much as I wanted to lighten my luggage, I did not want to sacrifice my ability to make large frame-able pictures.The answer is that with adequate light, the photos from the two are virtually indistinguishable. In terms of resolution, the math is straightforward: assuming a print resolution of 300 dpi, the Nikon makes 10x6.7-inch enlargements; the Lumix, 13.3x10 (the maximum pixel count is reached at 3:2 aspect ratio for the Nikon and 4:3 for the Lumix). In practice, one may not be able to enlarge Lumix photos any more than the Nikon because of the higher noise level of the Lumix; however, I am very happy to find that the Lumix can indeed match the enlarging capability of the Nikon with no compromises under normal outdoor lighting.In the last paragraph I qualified my findings by twice mentioning lighting levels. This brings me to the one major difference between the two classes of cameras (compact versus either a DSLR or Four Thirds): the size of the photo-pickup (CCD). The far smaller pickups in the compacts introduce significantly larger amounts of digital-camera noise at comparable ISO settings. I found that in the Lumix any ISO greater than 400 was pretty much unusable if one has a critical eye at all; or to put it another way, ISO 400 on the Lumix was roughly equivalent in noise to 1600 on the Nikon. At 200 ISO or below (well, actually the Nikon does not go below 200; but the Lumix has settings down to 80), the two cameras both exhibited negligible noise. Both my Nikon and the Lumix top out at ISO 1600; and while it is tempting to say that ISO 1600 is useless on the Lumix, it does at least allow one to get the picture, and to some extent one can reduce the noise to an acceptable level--at the expense of detail--using photo-processing software on a PC or Mac.The noise issue is significant, as it affects not only low-light photography but also action photography--any time one would like to use higher ISO settings. The fairly large apertures available on the Lumix (starting at f 2.8 at the wide-angle end of the zoom) help a little bit in that for any given situation they allow the use of a slightly lower ISO, but we're only talking about a difference of maybe ISO 200 versus ISO 300--pretty insignificant when what one really needs is ISO 1600. Incidentally, the Lumix's smallest aperture is f8, limiting its potential for great depth of field.Although the image stabilization on the Lumix has been reported in some reviews to be superior to that in the competing PowerShot, I do not find it to be as good as that in my Nikon VR zoom, although I hasten to add that my observation is not based on scientific tests. I'm just finding so far that I have made more motion-blurred photos with the Lumix than with the Nikon during my experimentation over the past two weeks. I also note a slight twitch in the image in movie mode when zoomed out beyond 10x.The best surprise in the Lumix was the high quality of the zoom lens. It exhibits lower geometric distortion than my Nikon zoom and focuses just as sharply.These findings are not to imply that a relatively inexpensive compact can match the quality of a pricey DSLR or Four Thirds system (by the time one outfits it with extra lenses). Technology has moved forward for these cameras, too, which now boast high megapixels without the noise that accompanies the small-pickup compacts, and many more ease-of-use features than the DSLRs used to. One does have to ask oneself, however, whether the higher quality in challenging light conditions is worth paying four or five times as much for.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "J.

The picture quality was always superior, and unlike digital point and shoots, they didn't break just by looking at them. Although I cannot vouch for how long this camera will last, it seems to be pretty well built. No unwanted vibrations and it is solid and pretty small. I had to find something that did more than the $100-$200 shirt pocket type cameras, but something that my wife might still be willing to take with her to take pictures at a party or one of my kids sporting events or concerts. This camera definitely fits the bill. Although the 18X zoom is not as powerful as some of the others on the market, you can stretch it to 35X if you use only three megapixels. You'll still get a good picture for online or a 4x6 print with that. The camera also takes excellent HD videos with decent stereo sound. Its excellent autofocus tracking also helps keeping on your subject when taking video or burst shooting. The lag is pretty small too, so you don't have to guess where somebody is going to be when the shutter finally releases.If there is an issue with the camera, it is that there is no printed manual, and the manual could certainly be more informative. For example, nowhere does it state that you won't be able to take HD video using the in-camera memory (you can actually get about a 1-minute low-resolution video in its 50mb. Also, there are so many different functions, that a good manual would be very helpful, even for us guys who don't like taking directions or reading a manual.Some of the outstanding features include: AF tracking and focus lock, which allows the camera to track a particular subject. Multiple scene modes have the program adjust for different conditions (back lighting, movement, candle light, bright sun etc). This is where a better manual would come in very handy. The camera can produce JPEG, raw or JPEG and raw files, so you can edit away if you like. Its red eye reduction is decent, but there is no in-camera red eye editing.Be aware that the HD movies can be created in two file types. JPEG is what most of the world uses, while the AVCHd allows longer movies, it is much harder to work with for editing and many programs cannot use it.Overall, this camera fits the bill.

I spent four days working with this camera in every possible scenario: tripod and no tripod, indoors and outdoors, day time and night time.Here is the overriding problem:The noise in the pictures is definitely higher and more noticeable than my Lumix FZ10 because it does not have an ISO 50 setting (the lowest is ISO 80), AND, the biggest difference, my old Lumix FZ10 maintains the 2.8 aperture all through the zoom range. Once you get past 12X in the FZ35, the aperture automatically goes up, and you can't even force it down in manual mode.Even when I forced the ISO to 80 and took pictures in full sun, the details were much more noisy than my old Lumix FZ10. I'm sure they would print fine for the most part, but if you want high-end posters, you will see it. I also noticed that the FZ10 stabilization (Lumix Mega OS) was better than the dual Power OS on the FZ35.Sadly, I returned the camera and will stick with my Lumix FZ10 that has a low ISO for now.

Since experiencing it's capabilities, it's usually the ONLY camera I bother with...especially if my subject(s) moves or 'make noise'...read on.The 720p videos are so good on my Samsung 40\" (1080p) TV my fiance, on seeing my videos of a drag race thought she was watching an HD Network sports broadcast. Also...the sound...it picked up the sound of the Nitro-fuelers (during which I tightly covered my ears) which was VERY realistically reproduced by a JBL 5.1 spkr system which includes a subwoofer.  Also of significance is the slower zoom when video taping.  It appears to 'drag' when shooting but is VERY preferable when viewed during playback.Now...regarding photos. I've been a professional photographer having a studio for over 35 years. I've used everything from my Minolta SRT-101 to Nikon F3's, Hasselblad 6x6 and (kicking and screaming) digital. I was literally forced (professionally) to digital when my pro-lab in Springfield, MO stopped processing film (about 2 years ago).  Digitally I have owned an early Panasonic RF, Minolta A1&2s, a Nikon D70, a D300 and lastly, my FZ35.  I'm not going to tell you the photos from the FZ35 are the image quality of those of the D300 (nor the Nikon F3s).  You know that can't be true! But...they are the closest of those of other 'under $1000 digital cameras' I've owned and/or tested!!!The most amazing feat is the camera's results when HAND HELD, I shoot at 18x + 4x digital zoom = 72x times 27mm = 1944mm (equivalent to 35mm 'normal'  of 50mm thats nearly 40x). Everyone to whom I have literally demonstrated the results (EVEN UNDER 'BRIGHT' INDOOR LIGHTING) have similar questions..how much and where do I get one?If one considers that Leica has been supplying that 18x lens (or the license to produce it) for years and in several panasonic models the quality shouldn't be a surprise. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" as the saying goes. Obviously that particular lens formula is 'dead on.'Before closing there are two (2) other very important features making the camera a VERY WORTHY companion...especially at action loaded events.  First, you can completely control your viewing/reviewing choice of the EVF (electronic view finder) or the LCD screen.  You can use either for composing AND viewing or (as I do) the EVF for composing/shooting and the LCD for viewing.  In on bright sunny day...which I faced for air shows this summer, I used the EVF for both.  Personnally I would NEVER buy a Point & Shoot not having an EVF.  The screen (including the viewing of my D300) is worthless in a sunlit environment demanding a hunt for 'shade' to even HOPE to see it.Sincerely, an \"AMAZON PRIME\" member", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "If you are considering a DSLR, look at this camera first", "Author": "William I. Griffith", "ReviewID": "R1QWOWS96N3GAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing, it is also amazingly complicated.  On the other hand it has many automatic settings that seem to work fine.  The main point of this review has to do with DSLR cameras.  I have used high quality film type SLR cameras for 40 years, however I have not had a DSLR, and was going to buy one.  After using this camera, I can't imagine ever owning a DSLR.  Why?  Because this camera for the average enthusiast, someone like me, does everything you could do with a DSLR and three separate lenses for about 1/5th the price and 1/10th the weight.  I am sure it does not have the rugged construction of a DSLR, but most people do not need that. An additional plus, if you are into video, you no longer need a special camera for that.  It is sort of like, in concept, a smart phone that replaces a number of different special use gadgets (PDA, voice recorder, camera, video, etc.).One other thought, technology changes at an amazing pace, unless you are a professional, why spend extra money for unneeded durability and extra long life if it is going to be out of date in three years?  I rarely wear out a camera, phone, computer, etc.  I normally replace such things because the new ones have attractive features that make the old ones obsolete.  Until something better comes along, I am stuck on \"super zoon\" cameras like this one.  I don't know much about the competition, but this is a great one at an attractive price.  Before buying I looked closely at the features and reviews of all major brands.  This camera seemed to have the most loyal following with the fewest complaints.  I imagine the others to be quite good, but this one is for sure.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Positive about Panasonic", "Author": "Oldanalyst", "ReviewID": "RZPYCI6C5GNP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For some time, I had been considering downgrading cameras to something which was lighter and easier to handle than my Nikon DSLR. However, I worried about buying a camera that had too much lag time between shots and also a much degraded lens system. So I jumped at the purchase of a Fuji HS-10 and was truly disappointed with lags in picture saving. Additionally, the time between battery charges was extremely short. So I returned the Fuji and bought the camera which was second on my list. What was wrong was my list. The Panasonic should have been first.As soon as I received the camera, I charged up the battery and started shooting. Unfortunately, our weather was dark and dreary so I thought I would not really get any good pictures. Wrong! The camera performed quite well in low light situations. I found that using ISO settings as high as 800 gave pictures with little noise. I would recommend using 400 or less for routine use but even 1600 gave acceptable results. I was able to use burst modes to get shots of birds flying and ducks moving around in our pond. The time needed to save pictures after a burst was acceptable. Even the time between saving RAW shots was acceptable and not much different from my Nikon DSLR.What really pleased me was the vibration reduction of this camera. It actually was better than that in the Nikon lens I had been using. I am able to hand hold the camera and get pictures at 18x. Realize that if you opt to decrease the resolution, you can get optical magnifications up to 35.2x although this requires a tripod or exceptionally steady hands. Using digital zoom will boost the zoom at 12M to 72x although this amounts to taking a picture at 3M. You can play with all of these to see what your zoom limit is for pictures acceptable to you.I have tried the macro mode and find it works as advertised. I will be using this a lot more as the weather gets better as I take a lot of pictures of flowers and bugs. In my brief use, I found it to be comparable the macro modes on other digital cameras I have owned.Likewise, the video mode is excellent. I mainly will be using the picture modes so the video modes are just icing on the camera cake for me. They too worked as advertised. In fact, I think I will have fun with them!Initially, I cussed out Panasonic for the lack of a manual. It didn't help that the abbreviated manual with the camera slid out of the box when I unpacked the camera and fell to the floor. I did not find it for a couple of days. But amazingly, I was able to do most everything the camera can do without a manual. I had downloaded the PDF manual but initially did not read it. After finding the printed manual, I realized that the camera menus are quite logical especially to someone who has owned 2 other ultra zooms, a DSLR and a Panasonic underwater camera. I had even figured out some cryptic icons by simply taking pictures and seeing what the various settings did. I guess I really did not need the printed manual. I applaud Panasonic for a very good menu system on the camera. The printed manual is correct but brief and the PDF manual is complete and generally well organized.One of my big gripes of the Fuji HS-10 was the extremely poor battery life of the batteries. This may have been a fluke but was real. The Panasonic has excellent battery life. I have taken over 400 pictures, interfaced with my computer and edited pictures off the card without downloading them to my computer and have still got a battery that has a lot of charge left. This matches my experience with the underwater Panasonic my wife uses. It too takes many pictures between charges.Is this a perfect camera? No such animal exists. There are some quirks but I have found nothing that will prevent me from using the camera as I expected to use it. Initially, I thought maybe the camera was too light. I now am convinced that the lightness will be great for trips. Initially, I thought AAA batteries would be excellent since they are so widely available and are inexpensive. But after my experience with the Fuji and with the outstanding lifetime of one charge on the Panasonic battery, I am convinced I was wrong.In summary, I feel the lens system is excellent, the vibration reduction is excellent, the quality of pictures is just short of excellent but as good as you are going to get from a non DSLR, the menu system is logically laid out and the battery life is excellent. On top of this, the camera arrived quickly after I purchased it and Amazon was quite prompt with refunding the money for my returned Fuji camera. I think I am a satisfied customer!", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited to own & happy to use the Panasonic DMC-FZ35", "Author": "r.a.b", "ReviewID": "RJW2C9SCO3HLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As several others have noted here, I deliberated for months between buying the Canon SX20IS or the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 before finally pulling the trigger on the FZ35. This was a particularly tough decision for me, as I had previously owned a Canon S3 that had served reasonably well. Although the S3IS provided thousands of suitable images, I was never as happy with its optical sharpness as I had been with that provided by a Sony (DSC-707 model) and its Carl Zeiss lens. Although featuring only 5X power, my memory of that wonderful Zeiss lens always stirred a slight discontent with respect to my opinion of the Canon S3IS.Because I didn't want to \"upgrade\" once again without at least matching the optical quality of the Sony, I paid special attention to how users and professional reviewers appeared to rank the Canon SX20IS and Panasonic DMC-FZ35 in that respect. From what I gleaned from hundreds of reviews, the FZ35 seemed superior to the 20IS with respect to image sharpness. Also, from a handling standpoint, I didn't care for the bulkier size and somewhat heavier Canon. Therefore, based mainly on published and online reviews (as I was never able to actually hold a FZ35 beforehand), I bought the Panasonic, sight unseen, through Amazon.After experiencing the results of roughly 500 shots now, the bottom line is that I am very happy to own the Panasonic. Although I am not positive that, under the best of lighting conditions, the FZ35's resolution is quite on par with that of my previously owned Sony DSC-707, it does appear reasonably close. Because of its 18X zoom and the fact that the dynamic range of the FZ35 is much more forgiving than that of either my much older Sony 707 or my relatively recent Canon S3, the Panasonic is (overall and unequivocally) the best camera I've used to date.So, I am extremely pleased with my Panasonic DMC-FZ35. I don't expect to miss not having the Canon's hot shoe, nor have I any difficulty accepting Panasonic's proprietary battery pack. My most serious gripe stems from the fact that most settings are menu controlled (duh!). But, the learning curve for how all the different menus overlap and sometimes affect associated configurations is STEEP--at least for me, it is. I didn't realize until I bought this FZ35 how digitally challenged I must be! Whereas the Sony was as easy as \"falling of a log\" to use and the Canon was perhaps a notch or two more difficult, this Panasonic has definitely stretched my perseverance! However, the more I iterate between studying the printed-out manual (218 pages!) and hands-on experimentation, the more adept I am becoming. Of course, the redeeming counterbalance to the FZ35's complexity is its automatic (IA) mode, which I've discovered is not all that bad!", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy it!", "Author": "Daniel Winter", "ReviewID": "R1W2K2329J4FKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reason I'm writing another review for this camera (there ane many, most of them written by people who are far better photographers than I am) is to help people who, like myself some weeks ago, cannot decide whether to buy it or not. I'll tell you how it worked for me, maybe you're going through the same: I have a point-and-shoot that craves for sunlight, and I wanted to be able to take better photos, assuming some loss of portability but also aware that buying a DSLR was too big a step for me. Well, I read a lot (I mean A LOT) and bought a FZ35. I've been using it for a few days already and I love it. It's very light and small, looks robust enough and takes great pictures. Anyway, reviews I read diverged in some points (and that's what makes you unsure), which I'll try to clarify:- Night/low light pictures: while some photographers (who sure are used to shoot with $2,000+ DSLRs) and users here say it's a weekness, it's certainly one of the things I liked best about this camera; it was a huuuge step forward when compared with my old little point-and-shoot. I've taken pictures from a lit church at night (yes, dark! Around 10 PM!) with 7x zoom WITHOUT a tripod and they look good, especially with the stabilization feature on; if you use a tripod they'll come out amazing;- LCD: looks good, including the resolution (which is not terrific, but really suffices); I have no use for tilting (maybe you do, I don't);- Viewfinder: good, bright, visible, exact, but... A little tiny; useful, though;- Manual: well, the one included is pretty basic (they're right about this one).Anyway, the main reason I bought this camera is for shooting better pictures, especially in low-light situations. I loved it. It's a wonderful camera, and it's worth every cent. I would buy it if I were you. Good luck!Update Jan 27th, 2010: I've posted some pics at flickr (name is d_winter) so you can see for yourself what happens in real life. There are three pics from the same church: two shot in low-light without a tripod (one very good, and the other only slightly blurred, but again, zoomed and no tripod used) and one that was shot with a tripod (beautiful).

My first Lumix was the original high zoom DMC-FZ1 from 2003. I fell in love with the Lumix high optical zoom cameras since then due to the Leica lens (Leica is considered to be the Rolls Royce of camera lens), image quality, durability and ease of use. A few years later I upgraded to the DMC-FZ7 which is also another great Lumix camera. I recently upgraded to the DMC-FZ35 for the continued image quality and also HD video recording ability. It became  tiring having to carry a separate camera and video recorder when on vacation. I sold my HD video camera (Canon HF100) and Lumix DMC-FZ7 for this camera so I can have both items in one instead. I have been impressed as before with the image quality. I did notice that the photo quality is more vibrant than previous Lumix cameras. This camera has a newer processor than my F7. The photos are sharp and vibrant. I do not think the photos can get any better than this. I did notice that this camera is slightly bigger than my previous Lumix cameras which surprised me however it is similar in weight. The camera is built solidly and appears durable. As for the video quality, I am not able to give it 5 stars. It does record in HD (1280x720) instead of 1920x1080 however the video quality could use some improvement. Video at full 1280x720 AVCHD is supposed to be the best possible image quality however it looks more like DVD quality instead of full HD. Video looks good outdoors in bright light however it does become grainy and dull indoors as is a common problem with most HD video cameras. My Canon HF100 HD video camera is a highly rated video camera however it also had the same image quality problem when used indoors. The camera does allow optical zoom while recording however the adjustment speed is around 1/2 of photo zoom. I do not know why the zoom feature moves slowly while video recording compared to photo zoom. Overall, this is a great camera for the price: Leica lens, full manual control, durability, excellent photo quality, SD card recording (cheaper media cost compared to Sony media cards), decent video quality.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "J. fox", "ReviewID": "RA3NFD96EVJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It takes a while to get used to all the modes, but wow this is a great camera.  Most cameras with this size zoom seem to suffer lower image quality, but not this beast.  It seems that whatever situation I am in there is a mode to aid my shot.  For example, I was at an aquarium and I saw these amazing jelly fish which I wanted to shoot.  May I remind you that is all glass and dark inside.  I made a few clicks in the menu and found \"airplane\" mode which is for taking shots out the window of a jet.  I was not expecting anything special, but when I got my camera home I immediately downloaded them onto my computer and HOLY SH..  Amazing.  I've also shot in snow, done action shots of my niece with bubbles, sunsets (which I am entering in a competition via request of my family), and macro shots of flowers.  The only time when I am a little disappointed is with indoor shots.  The flash is almost too powerful and it creates a very white skin tone and large shadows.  I will have to work on some other settings I guess.One other note, I am able to hook this camera up to my 40\" LED TV.  I invited some friends and family over to look at a slideshow I set up and they were blown away.  This is actually the time they told me to enter some of my pics in a competition.  They looked amazing even at that size, and the quality even surprised me.  Many of my shots were done in what is called \"intelligent\" mode which is basically if you want everything automatic or point and click mode.  This is by far the best auto mode I've experienced on any camera.  My shots from Boston were all done in that mode and my fiance commented that some looked like they should be postcard.  While in Boston there was this hawk sitting on a light post it was a beautiful photo-op.  I zoomed in all the way, and snapped a few.  Now you'd expect some loss of detail zoomed in at 18x, but there was none.  They were crisp, bright and beautiful.In conclusion I love this camera.

The thing that I liked most about it is that the movies are in Quick Time format, meaning that you can take far longer videos because Quick Time captures at 10 frames per second instead of 30 fps.I took it to a concert and was a football field away from the stage and yet the clarity and detail of those photos was amazing. It was as if I were standing right at the foot of the stage, with a lesser quality camera. The video taken from that distance was beautiful. I leave it on auto mode most of the time, so there is nothing left to do but point and shoot. The face recognition feature is spot on, and the auto focus works great. I let someone shoot some pictures with it an event and now she is asking for one for her birthday.You do need to run a high capacity card in it if you are using one over 2 gb.

I haven't been disappointed.  I've just returned from a demanding two-week photo shoot in Cambodia and Vietnam, where I was doing heavy duty photography under a variety of conditions.  The camera was great in its ease of use, flexibility and response to different lighting conditions, and the overall quality of the results.  As with any new camera, the user needs to become comfortable with the product and test its capacities.  The Lumix battery that comes with the camera is solid in support of heavy use -- I made the mistake of purchasing the less expensive \"same as\" battery as my back up, and found that it provided only half the battery life as the original.  I was getting around 300 photos on the original with a limited mix of flash shots.  I was quite pleased at the camera's capacity to take solid photography in a variety of lighting conditions without the need to pop-up the in-camera flash.  I would often double with flash shots in testing the camera's capacity, and found that the non-flash shots offered a good end-option. It takes about 2 hours to recharge the battery (not the 90 minutes the instructions suggest); the battery charger that comes with the camera was easy to use in a variety of international settings (110-220) without the need for a separate adapter other than a wall-plug conversion. I'm currently transitioning my photos into a variety of media uses, and finding that the high density and overall quality of my originals supports any follow-up editing at publication standard. The reviews I had read praised the camera's quality leica lense -- I totally agree.Several of the product reviewers were negative on their ability to handle the camera's small adjustment mechanics.  I did not find this to be the case, although I did find that I needed to get up-to-speed in the effective use of these.  The camera's auto field response is solid; you need to learn how to use the variety of focal options that the camera provides.  The camera's zoom is good -- I found that really long-distance close-ups were of less quality than what I can get with my SLR Nikon lenses, but overall I was pleased with the zoom once I became comfortable with its capacity. I was very satisfied with the camera's lense speed in negating potential \"shakes.\"In sum, I highly recommend this camera as an excellent product for the price,its overall ease of use, and the consistent quality of its end-product -- this is a great camera for those who are uncomfortable in making ongoing camera adjustments and would rather leave the camera in \"auto.\"  My wife attest that this is a great and easy step up from her smaller point and shoot digital.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a great camera", "Author": "Saeed52", "ReviewID": "RBVN2CFHLW0K3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Enough good things said about the Fz35 camera so I won't waste your time and just get to the point.

I got it less than 1 week before having to shoot photos at a wedding. I have always been a Canon lover and figured I would never stray from the fold. But after very much research, I actually was intrigued with the things I read about the Lumix FZ35. This is where I take a leap of faith. In under 2 days of pushing buttons, perusing menus and taking maybe 4 practice shots, I threw myself into the wedding photo arena and I was very pleased with my results. The pictures were clean and sharp, the color was very true, the auto focus was fast and sure. I even shot 23 minutes of AVCHD video during the rehearsal ( mind you I have Never shot video in my life ), and it turned out immaculate. For anyone who likes to shoot video, this AVCHD is a no brainer in my opinion. The only iffy pics in the whole lot were completely my own fault for not selecting a faster shutter speed to shoot moving targets. For the price of this camera and what you get it is an amazing deal. It has the sophistication to please anyone who doesn't require a SLR, and for those who need something a little more simple, I think this more than fits the bill as a superior point and shoot in iA mode and the video enthusiasts will love this thing. Battery life...a real pet peeve of mine, especially with some previous Canons I have owned. I shot between 400 and 500 pictures, in jpeg light compression mode, many of these were in raw mode for editing to ensure the wedding party got some that would be frame worthy, and then the 23 minutes of video.By the end of the day...battery life was down only 1 bar out of 3 !! I bought a second back up battery for this event and didn't even come close to needing it. My niece was shooting with a Nikon Coolpix L110 and easily went through 20 AA batteries at this event. Don't get me wrong, her Nikon takes wonderful pictures, but we are talking battery life here.  By the way, I never used the flash once with a single photo of the wedding and the camera compensated beautifully. I did shoot a few shots at a rehearsal dinner in a restaurant and opted for a flash and it worked extremely well. Over the entire weekend, I got not a single red-eye. To wind this up, I am not telling you to buy this camera, but I am telling you, you will be very pleased if you do. I used TopRam 32 gig SDHC class 6 storage media and backup battery ( not needed ) was from Battery Head. Zeikos 3 filter kit for protection.

I am a computer user only (no printing) so everything is based on my perspective on a 13 inch macbook pro screen. I have used the fz35 for 5 months by now. I shoot mostly raw and mjpg video which I edit with Silkypix (came with it) and Avidemux (free) respectively. Both softwares are great! I shoot with manual settings only, so I can't tell much about the lots of presets the camera menu has. I shoot mostly indoors.Things I state for the camera:1. Max acceptable ISO for pictures - 400 and videos 800. So go ahead and set the max ISO from the menu.Good quality comes accordingly with 80 and 400 (which are the lowest possible settings for both).2. I use MJPG for videos, AVCHD is bad in my opinion. I never liked it! MJPG is absolutely great (in 720p), but the max file size in this format is 2GB, so you can do only about 8:30 minutes at a time. Having to press record button again after this is annoying, I don't know, why the camera does not do it by itself.3. Image Stabilizer is great! Handheld shutter speeds can work even at 1/4 seconds, but not always.4. I had to learn the software that came with it.Tips for Silkypix - Noise and sharpness are together as one unit in the menu. Select - natural/fine when shot with flash or good lighting and use noise color from 45-60 and noise reduction - 10-15.  Works great for me.Avidemux noise \"mplayer HQDN3D\"- good conditions - noise luma 0, chroma 0 and temporal 3 and medium/bad conditions (2:3:6).5. 18x zoom is huge, I hardly ever use it. I did it in one concert, felt great. But 99% of the time I go up to 4x which is about 100mm in 35mm frame equivalent.6. Super battery life!Conclusion:The jack of all trades. Does everything well, but not very well either. I think it is nr. 1 only with zoom. DSLR can't have such zoom, unless you have a really huge and expensive lens, which is heavy too.

There is not really much to compare between the two.

I own this camera second day now and I took some sample shots, night shots, macro etc...and I was amazed.

Reading all of the reviews and doing precise sample picture comparison, I found (personal opinion) that FZ35 takes noticeably better pictures, especially in low light conditions (less noise). In fact, I compared the quality of the pictures produced by FZ35, to some of $600-$800 DSLR and decided that FZ35 is a better deal. Going back to FZ40, it's still a great camera...I believe, that is even faster at response, and comes with even more features, however, I was somehow disappointed when it came to noise.Putting all of this together, this is an excellent camera that will not disappoint you (unless you are a pro DSLR photographer).

I took this camera on a six week round the world trip and used it for both still shots and video.  I have had numerous compliments on my pictures since I returned and I do not consider myself more than a hobby photographer... definitely NOT professional.  This is my second Panasonic Lumix camera (first was the DMC-LS2 also purchased from Amazon).  It still works great, but I wanted something with sound and better zoom capabilities.  I bought them because of Panasonic's Leica lens.  I was well aware of Leica's painstaking quality.  I could not afford a Leica, but still wanted that quality.  I am thrilled with the video and still shots I captured on my trip and very pleased with this camera.  The one thing I love after the picture quality is how lightweight this camera is to carry and hold - especially for videos.  No more tired hands or arms or cramped fingers trying to hold it still.  This was carried from Guam, to England and all over Paris on a day trip.  I bought several SDHC cards for my trip to make sure I never ran out of space for my videos and still shots and I also got an extra capacity battery.  I found out I could run for weeks on one charge for the battery and never ran out of storage capacity on the SDHC card in the camera (8 GB most of the time).

I wanted to get my own camera for a long time and I was confused between a lot of mega-zoom cameras.I initially started out looking at the Canon SX200 IS. It is a nice camera with 12x Optical zoom, but the only and biggest drawback is that it doesn't let us use that super zoom while recording video! I mean what camera does that?I was suggested the Panasonic range of cameras by most of my friends and I started researching them. Now Panasonic is not usually perceived as a camera making company, but believe me, I was taken aback at their amazing range of cameras.I was then confused between the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3(TZ7) and the FZ35. While the FZ35 is a mega-zoom camera with a large body, the ZS3 is all the goodness of the FZ35 in a compact form factor (with a 12X optical zoom instead of 18x in the FZ35). I was torn between a small size, portability, and sleek looks versus extra features, bigger zoom, and larger body.In the end I wanted a camera which will help me learn about cameras and photography and let me grow with it. I wanted to be able to play around with the settings and decide for myself what suits me best. In that way, the ZS3 is very limited. True, it has great features and good hardware, but it relies heavily upon its iA (Intelligent Auto) mode for photography. While it was good for me to start with Auto mode, I wanted to experiment with the camera and that was possible only with the FZ35.I made a good decision in hindsight. I am very happy with this camera. It shoots superb scenery mode pictures, and its macro shots are worthy of praise every time.

I could go on and say all the positive things others have already mentioned, but I'll just list some very minor negatives.1) Sometimes the camera's auto white balance arbitrarily makes the pictures overly warm, which is fixable in many ways, but if you are just shooting along in iA mode, some of your pictures will come out orange-ish.  I had the same issue with my FZ28 as well.2) The flash must be deployed manually.  In other words, if the camera's sensors detect / determine that a shot could use the flash, it can't automatically pop the flash up for you, you have to press the mechanical release button yourself.  Some may not see this as an issue, but for me, if the shot will come out better with a flash, and I'm in \"intelligent auto\" mode, shouldn't it be smart enough and automatic enough to use the flash automatically?3) The battery life is good, but not amazing.  You'll probably have enough juice in one battery to photo / video one, 2 to 3 hour event (although not continuously).  However, if you are going on a day-long tour or something, you'll need a spare battery for sure.  (By the way, the Lenmar DLP006 battery sold here on Amazon works great, I have 3... no difference from the official battery as far as I can tell).4) It's not a pocket camera in the slightest, nor is it trying to be one... but I thought I'd mention this to people considering this as their ONLY camera.  If you think it's too bulky to lug-around with you and you leave it behind, you'll miss great photos.  My wife always has a small L19 Nikon pocket camera in her purse for less formal / everyday events / impromptu shooting.PRO-TIP: One of the biggest tips I can give people when they try to use digital cameras to take quick pictures (kids in motion, pets, sports, etc) is to pre-focus.  Holding down the shutter (\"take the picture\" button) half-way (half-press) a few seconds before the magic moment happens allows you to snap that picture off in a fraction of a second.  What it does is the camera gathers all the focus and other info it needs in order to be \"automatic\" when you half-press... then, when you fully click it down it just records the light coming in the lens.  It doesn't need to calculate / measure / determine, etc... so bottom line... Want to capture your kid in that split second they are laughing?  PRE-FOCUS WITH A HALF-PRESS a couple seconds before, then fully click it in that exact moment... that's the secret to getting fast, DSLR-like speed.FINAL WORD: Awesome camera.  The above are super minor points that shouldn't really sway you away.p.s.  In my opinion it would be nice if the next version of this camera (FZ42?) had a larger 3\" LCD that articulated (moved around on an arm), automatically deployed flash pop-up, automatic lens cap / cover, recorded 1080p video, uses standard AA-sized batteries (NiMH, Li-Ion 14500, Lithium primaries, and in a pinch, Alkalines) instead of a proprietary battery (although I'm glad they don't lock-out 3rd party batteries like they do with the ZS3), a bit quicker to respond zoom (it's a bit sluggish to get going on the FZ28 & 35 models, and I wouldn't mind if the camera was a bit less \"light-plasticy\" feeling (although there's something to be said about the benefits of it being light), it just doesn't psychologically feel solid / hefty / quality, if you can pick up what I'm lay'in down.

This camera is what you want to have when you plan to take good, composed shots.Slightly larger than most ulta zoom cameras, the extra width is put to good use, allowing the user to hold the camera firmly with 2 hands for those longer range shots. The left thumb and forefinger wrap perfectly around the camera body.Something else worth mentioning is the threaded lens barrel, allowing for the use of filters. Even if you do not plan on shooting with filters, a clear UV filter can be attached and left on without interfering with the lens cap.

It would have the form-factor of a camera, rather than being built around the media it formerly needed to accommodate.  And it would have fine optics in front.  So I was really annoyed when tapeless digital consumer-grade camcorders first emerged, but kept the cumbersome form-factor of their taped predecessors, and even worse, eliminated the viewfinder altogether, making them useless outdoors in sunshine.This is the camera of my dreams--literally.  But I never dreamed there would be features such as optical image stabilization, or that zoom would exceed 10x or so, or that it would cost under $300, with a Leica lens!  18X zoom is way more than I would ever need, since my philosophy is \"get as close as you can.\" And since it has the form-factor of a still camera, you can hold it at chest level as though you are \"between shots\" in order to get close and talk to people without them becoming self-conscious.The main reason I chose the Panasonic over the comparable models by other brands, is the Leica lens. Having \"Leica\" engraved on the front of your lens won't automatically make you a better artist, but it makes you feel like you can be. I know there are others who feel the same way about Nikon or Canon, and perhaps little distinguishes this camera from the other brands in this class (although it was around $150 cheaper at the time I bought it.)Things that I really like about this camera:1. Razor-sharp, high-contrast 27mm (equivalent) f 2.8 Leica lens, (486 mm f 4.4 at full zoom)2. HD video recording can be started in any mode using the movie button, taking advantage of each mode's special features (except those involving the flash, obviously).3. Creative movie mode turns it into a pure camcorder, with the shutter-release serving as a start-stop button, and allowing as much or as little manual control as you want over exposure, focus, and white-balance. It is surely as good or better a camcorder than any consumer-grade camcorder on the market, particularly since none of them even has a viewfinder any more.A few minor annoyances in this camera are:1. Inability to change battery or memory while mounted to a tripod2. Proprietary USB connector.3. Inability to switch between viewfinder and screen while recording video.4. Inability to activate the manual-focus-assist while recording video.5. Nose smudges the LCD while using the viewfinder.The viewfinder is barely adequate when compared to a SLR.  But compared to not having one, it is absolutely delightful. The image apparent size is about 25% of a SLR, with visible pixelization. The jitter from the slow refresh is more annoying than the low resolution, which is only a factor when trying to manually focus, but is still better than the LCD in most circumstances.  Manual-focus is possible thanks to manual-focus-assist, which magnifies the center of the frame to fill either a larger superimposed square, or the entire screen if you configure it so.  Neither display is adequate for evaluating depth of field.The proof that this camera is at the peak of its development, is in how little improvement was made in its successors, the DMC-FZ40 and the DMC-FZ100.  Their increased zoom from 18x to 24x is only a 33% increase.  Their rear dial sounds like a nice idea, except for the disclaimer in the manual saying it isn't adequate for fine adjustments in focus (so what's the point?). The zoom mike, increased pixel count, and slight rearrangement of controls seem to be the only other changes in common.  On the FZ100, there is also the hotshoe, mic input, articulating screen, faster type of sensor, and 1080i video recording. The articulating screen might be handy at times, but it does add mass and complexity.  And since you will tend to keep it turned in for protection, you may end up using it less in favor of the viewfinder. The slow-motion recording might be a feature of interest to some. But the 1080i resolution at the same bitrate of the 720p recording, is not going to give you better video quality.The primary improvement that interested me in the FZ35's successors (the FZ40 and FZ100) was their increased wide-angle to 25mm (35mm equivalent).  But I compared the specifications side by side and discovered that in the newer models, the lens zoom range is cropped to 31mm to 735mm in movie mode.  Now that I've received the FZ35, I see that its image width is also cropped somewhat in movie mode, which was not stated in the specs on the Panasonic site.  Measuring as best I can on the LCD, the photo image is 54mm wide, and the video frame is 51mm wide. So I am disappointed in the FZ35 in this respect, although I think it is still slightly wider than the FZ40 and FZ100 in movie mode.This camera easily replaces every consumer-grade camera and camcorder you have in your closet.  Of course there are compromises, but if you really need something that this camera doesn't offer, you probably need to move up to a higher class of camera, such as a DSLR or pro-grade camcorder. Moreover, a camera that costs under $300 is going to be taken to a lot of places where you wouldn't risk taking a $600-$1500+ camera.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great small but big featured camera", "Author": "BobShap \"seflbob\"", "ReviewID": "R3IPMMBTBAK3UO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd in this FZ series from Panasonic Lumix that I own. I have several other larger and heavier cameras (some also Lumix) and over the years (at least 67 taking photos) I have owned complete systems and more cameras than I care to count. I am an avid advanced amatuer photographer and always carry a camera of some sort. With age you want less to carry. I no longer enjoy having several cameras hanging on me, etc. or lugging a large camera around all the time. My need in what I call my daily camera is moderate price, small size, light weight, portabiity, great lens, good zoom range, dependability, full features and, absolutely, a viewfinder. The viewing screen on the back of the camera is worthless to me for focusing, framing, making sure I have what I am expecting, etc. Only value is in reviewing what I have already taken. I have tried the pocket cameras etc., but they fall into rapid disuse. Good for snapshots but nothing else. This camera is bigger than a pocket one but a lot smaller than a DSLR. Even smaller than my Panasonic G1 which itself is small by comparison to other cameras with interchangeable lenses. However The DMC-FZ35 gives you big camera features and has a fantastic Leica lens. The clarity of the camera lens and its ease of use make it a joy to use. I have only had this FZ35 a short time and am still discovering all the things it does. My latest discovery was HD Video. Many times I have been in the field photographing birds, my current obsession, and wished I had a small video camera. Now I can just move my thumb to the video button, press it and I am shooting HD Video with stereo sound and full access to all the settings including zoom and macro without taking my eye off the viewfinder thus losing my subject. I wish my larger, heavier cameras had this ability. The future ones will. If your needs match mine, then this is the camera for you.

I also have a full stable of Nikon equipment, having gone from Nikon film cameras to Nikon Digital...the last being the Nikon D5000. I ordered my first Lumix because I did not want to drag a bag full of lenses around on a trip to Europe. That camera performed outstandingly well, taking photos of the ColdStream Guards at the change of guards at Buckingham Palace in crisp detail and even honing in on the tiles of the face of Big Ben. Sorry, among my hundreds of photos, shown to all my photo enthusiast friends, no one...not one single person, could tell the difference between the photos I took with that Superzoom and those taken with a Digital SLR.Now, having said that, when I got this new Lumix, I was rather concerned. It was...almost toylike in the tiny size and feather weight. I honestly was concerned that Panasonic had simply made the next camera in the series a shadow of their former cameras to keep price down or something. I am here to scream out...\"I was wrong\".  This camera is everything the others ever were..and then some.I would have loved this camera to have a hot shoe and a tilt screen and I certainly hope Panasonic includes it in their next one, as they did the one prior to this....but while waiting for my \"slave flash\" and bracket holder to arrive, I had to photograph an event, on a dim lit (torches) at night. I was easily 25 feet away, with nothing but that diminutive flash to help me. I thought all was lost. Next to me was a guy with a MONSTER lens Cannon digital and his MONSTER size flash. Gear must have been two feet long and weighed ten pounds.  The poor fellow nearly lost his dentures when I was taking better shots...better LIT shots and MORE CLEAR action shots on that stage, then he was!  I will admit, I was SHOCKED myself, but there, clear for anyone to see, was the results. This camera was performing AMAZING things in dim light and with that tiny flash.Later, taking bright daylight photos, I was able to zoom in and get crystal clear shots of wildlife and architecture at long, long distances with the aid of that power stabilizer.I had tried out the SuperZoom cameras from Nikon and Fuji, but was not impressed with photo quality or how slow they were to lock into focus. This camera is FAST, in both departments.This is one potent little camera, and I am going to love taking it to Europe again this summer and again, not having to drag a bag full of lenses. I think my Nikon is going to be catching a lot of closet dust this year.Meanwhile, I did try the video mode too and while I did not do any long filming, the video I did take was crisp, colors were great and the sound was pretty good too, for outside.  I am still taking a new digital HD camcorder with me for the trip, so this camera will be for stills, but it is nice to know that I have a good backup video unit, which CAN zoom during filming..a super nice option.Overall, if you are taking a trip and want an all in one camera, with light weight, tons of manual options and capable of superb shots in any light...then this is the camera for you.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best point and shoot in the market", "Author": "Jean-Pierre Lara A", "ReviewID": "R2KMXIKRNH329J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After read many reviews about this camera and see the pictures taken with it I chose to buy it and now after more than 300 pictures I can say that I'm vey happy with the camera and accesories.The lens cap is very good and I use it all the time for protection of the lens. The only thing that you should have present is that you should remove it before to start the camera to avoid hit the lens, but it's not a really problem because the camera is programed to retract the lens if it find any obstacle.The belt is good though not excellent because is a little thin but it make very good its function.The weight of the camera is very good and is like if you were using a little camera not a DSLR, this could be a problem to some people but for me is a very good point.The picture quality is very good and the most important thing is that if you are not happy with the result you can set up parameters like saturation, sharp or contrast and get the quality picture in the way you wishIn my experience the camera tends to underexpose a little the pictures and the brightness of the LCD is a little high than the reality but these details it's possible to adjust them with a little more EV and decreasing the brightness of the LCD in the setup.It's neccesary some experimentation with the camera to adjust it to the right condition for you but it's not a difficult thing.The programed modes of the camera are very good and they have functioned very good when I have used. I have used specially the aperture priority and the portrait modes with very good results. In every single picture that I have taken I have used the help of the histogram and this has been a execellent way to guarantee very good pictures.The video has two formats, one is called AVCHD Lite and the other is in quick time format (.mov) both of it function very good, but to upload videos to youtube is more practical to use the .mov format. The quality is very good for my expectations and it has been very practical in the travels and events.The time of life of the battery is good and I think is indispensable a battery spare, I used Lenmar DLP006 Digital Camera Equivalent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A, CGR-S006A/1B, CGR-S006E Batteries and is a very good battery.For the memory card I use Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6 and it functions very good.The case that I use is Case Logic DCB-66 High Zoom Camera Case (BLUE) and though is not the most large case that you can find I can put in it: the camera, the spare battery, the original battery, the USB cable, the memory card and the lens hood.After to read so many reviews and use the camera for some months I can say that this is the best point and shoot in the market today and if one learn to use it in the right way the picture quality could be similar to a DSLR though not the same and this is important to remember.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 12.1MP", "Author": "Polonius Monk", "ReviewID": "R2J5ENFT6P5446", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews on digital cameras that I thought would provide quality to my standard in given price range, (Canon sx20, Canon sx30, Canon Rebel xs, Pentax k2000 and the Panasonic fz35 and fz40), I decided on the FZ35. Here's my review.The Canon sx20 and sx30 had too many bad reviews from owners and marginal reviews at [...], citing the cramming of mega pixels and adding more zoom length to the existing sensor of the sx10, which results in images that are less sharp than their predecessor. I was very impressed with the Canon Rebel xs, until I found that the optical image stabilizer was in the lens, not in the camera. That, and the kit lens of 29 to 88 (in 35mm equivalent) was what came for $459. I almost went for the Pentax k2000, which has OIS in the body, was also $459, had the 29 to 88 kit lens, and very good reviews.It occurred to me that some of the frustration I had during 30 years of film camera use, in formats that ranged from 35mm to medium format, was that either a bag of lenses was necessary in order to have enough range to get an image from very close to very far away, or that the lens I needed for the shot was not on the camera when I needed it, making some situations nearly impossible to capture. Not to mention the hassle of hot-shoe mounted flash units. So, I leaned closer to the super-zoom on the fz35, which is the equivalent of a 27 - 486mm. The Leica lens brought back memories of my old M3.Reviews of the Panasonic fz35 and fz40 at [...] were very impressive. Although, the fz40 suffers from the same problem the Canons had with the cramming of extra zoom and extra mps on the existing fz35 sensor, and the images from the 35 are sharper and have less noise at high ISO. These results were also compared on Amazon.com, where a user had posted images taken of the same scene with both the fz35 and the fz40, and the fz35 simply looked better. Another review on Amazon from a professional photographer from Missouri gave the fz35 very high praise. In the end, it was Amazon's holiday return policy and the unbelievably attractive $259 price that sold me. And, since Panasonic officially discontinued the fz35, Amazon was one of the few places that had a new one in this price range. Some camera stores had them priced $399.Upon holding it, the fz35 is about three-fourths the size of a regular 35mm, with only half the weight. It is very comfortable and thumb and fingers seem to fall naturally in place on buttons and switches. The battery comes without a charge, but was 100% after 2 hours. I also purchased a Transcend 8gb class 10 SDHC memory card for about $14.00, necessary because one is not supplied with the camera. Class 10 cards work better and faster, in recording images or video, as well as transferring the data to your computer. Via the USB cable, 100 highest quality jpg images transfer to my PC in about 20 seconds.Right out of the box, in full Program mode, the fz35 is capable of taking great pictures. However, if you take the time to read the manual (yes, it's in PDF, not in paper form), which takes about an hour, maybe two hours if you're not already familiar with photography concepts, the fz35 can produce outstanding high quality results.

I'm glad I did. Reviews of the new models by Fuji and Nikon have been mixed at best, and the sample pictures provided were not impressive. My experience so far with the FZ35 pretty much agrees with the mostly positive reviews here and on the popular camera sites. The FZ35 does everything I want, and does it well. While the zoom lens is not the longest out there, it performs better than most super zooms due to Panasonic's superior 'Power Optical Image Stabilization', and high quality Leica Lens. The lens is threaded so you can easily add filters if you like. The camera is loaded with features. Its 'Intelligent Auto' mode is the best automatic mode I've ever used in a point and shoot camera. If you like use your own setting, that is possible too, including a full manual mode. The most important feature of the camera is that it takes very good pictures under almost all circumstances. The video quality is above average too. If I had to knock anything on the picture quality is that the pictures do have some noise on the shadow areas, even on low ISO settings. This only becomes obvious if you 'pixel peep' though. Also,all around noise becomes more apparent at ISO above 200. This is not a big issue to me. The camera does have adjustable noise reduction though. All in all, I'm loving the FZ35. It takes above average pictures, has a great 18x zoom lens, and is priced right. As long as you don't expect DSLR quality pictures (NO super zoom point and shoot with a small sensor is going to produce these), the FZ35 is highly recommended.Pros:Very good results under most conditions.High quality Leica Lens.Best Image Stabilization in this category.Great 'Intelligent Automatic' Mode.Lightweight.Manual Controls.'RAW' Mode.Above average battery life.Above average video quality.Cons:Shadow Noise even at low ISO.'Noise' at ISO 400 and above is more than average.Proprietary USB cable.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great all-around camera", "Author": "Trevor Mack", "ReviewID": "R11JV9LBRITROT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When looking for a camera I had a set of requirements, namely, super zoom, HD movie capability, optical zoom while in movie mode, full manual controls, .raw images, and a reasonable price.

I would however, like to offer a suggestion to the many who've complained about having to print a large 220 page (or 110 sheets of 8 1/2\" x 10\") heavy, awkward, manual that is too voluminous to carry around in addition to the cost of ink, amount of paper used, etc. Why Panasonic and many other companies lately have pulled this fast one--seriously! while having it on CD is great for backup, it is TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL AND USELESS UNLESS \"WE\" take the time and print it ourselves soooo...This is what I did:*Select the printer's booklet setting (and it has to be booklet so the pages will be in the right order)that way it will print 2 pages on each side, for a total of 4 pages per sheet of paper (that way you only use 28 sheets of paper!).*Make sure you have your print quality at good or best since the print will be small (it should print out approx same font size as would be if the company HAD provided a little manual--DO A TEST RUN ON PAGES 1-4 to make sure you can read it ).*Take it to an office supply type store where the do bindings. I used a Staples Copy Center, very reasonably priced. For around $5.00 they cut the pages to 4\" x 5 1/2\", put a nice 1/2\" spiral binding (which I love because I can easily turn the pages without struggle and it opens flat effortlessly-you can choose a narrower spiral but I don't know if the pages will \"fight\" while turning them to the back-I chose the standard book, side-binding, not the flip over like a stenographer's notepad) I also I had them put on a clear plastic cover with a black water resistant sturdy backing. I slip it into a ziplock bag for further protection (when I'm carrying it around) and best of all, it slips into my camera bag just as sweet as can be.DO I THINK THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED A RIDICULOUSLY INEXPENSIVE MANUAL (probably cost them well under $1.00 each) YES YES YES....but the fact is THEY DIDN'T.So for those of you who took a star or two off your rating because you think your only option is or have printed a great big, impractical BOOK, there is a solution and you really need to have the manual on hand, especially if, like me, you don't use it every day and forget all the many options and settings to choose from.

It was pricier, but I felt the quality and features were worth the extra $80.To those who are new to photography, as I am, I would recommend that you read the 200+ page manual found on Panasonic's web site BEFORE using the unit so that you are able to use the camera to its full potential. This is definitely not your average \"point and shoot\" camera, although it can be used as one. It would be a shame to purchase a camera with features as great as this one and use it only in iA mode.Also, it would help greatly to know a thing or two about aperture, ISO, and shutter speed.

I had a canon S2 which is a similar super-zoom, its screen went black. I called canon and they fixed it for free after 3 or 4 years of ownership. But while my camera was down I started looking for another camera, my wife wanted to buy a new one for me. My 16 year old son was more then glad to get to use the canon full time. I did my research, CNET review was not so hot and consumers guide review of the FZ 28 did not get their recommendation. But Amazons users gave it 5 stars and CNET users gave it their highest marks. Also looked at other photo sites and it got very highly recommend. I do like camera labs.com. Before I put a lot of effort on learning how to use a camera I want it to be a keeper. Some of the things I have done so far are the following. First I video in HD 3 water polo games onto one 8 giga byte disk. I tried it with a tripod and without not much difference the stability was very good without a tripod. The HD was very good, I played it on my Panasonic blue ray player onto my Panasonic HDTV. I downloaded it to my Macbook which was easy. Getting used to I movie is also a work in progress. I tried the flash burst which also was very good. So far no blurry pictures. The zoom is very good, I noticed when I put it on manual I could use the digital zoom, there I would say you need a tripod lots of shaking when zooming out to 35x to 72x digital. The camera has lots of choices on the internal software which should keep most people happy. The sound Im picking up is very good in movie mode. The screen in back, is bright and has a way to enlarge the letters. Handling of the camera is nice because its light and of a mid size. The joy stick is easy to use. So far this camera is a keeper and a work in progress. I can not be to critical because Im not a professional. Also I did take some indoor pictures and so far very good. The price also seems fair. The lens has threads and comes with a hood. Really no complaints.

Good image quality if 100% magnification/crop is not required.BAD:Horrible noise in pictures at 100% magnification even at ISO-80.When zoomed, the noise increases. Pictures taken indoors with flash also has noise and same with pictures in shadows. My old Canon A560 has better picture quality indoors and in shadows. It seems that FZ35 uses higher ISO and slow shutter speed to get pictures all the time and results in bad quality.Conclusion:Good camera for average all around purpose and for outdoor daylight situations.

I wanted an affordable, high quality lightweight camera with a good optical zoom to bring along on my adventures, specifically so I could get nice bird shots within reasonable distances.  I bought the FZ35 a year ago, and it has not disappointed. I have absolutely no photography experience and still have been getting one great wildlife photo after another with the FZ35.  The 18x optical zoom is great, and since I'm too lazy to edit my photos before posting them online, I've been using the digital zoom as well (tripod needed) for close up of relatively far animals and have been happy with the results.  I've taken this lightweight camera (some reviewers complain that it feels TOO light.  Seriously?? If it's well constructed and highly durable, what's the problem?) on multi-day backpacking trips all over the west, have dropped it on dirt and in wet snow, while skiing- many times- each time thinking that it has breathed it's last photo, but so far it always stays alive and well!  Just a bit of cleaning and back to work.  Speaking of work, I surveyed birds for a whole summer in Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest and throughout the Gospel Hump Wilderness, and my FZ35 was the official work camera of my crew.  I/we used it extensively every single day, especially during hours of intensive vegetation sampling for the Forest Service.  For this research we needed many habitat/vegetation photos, often in terrible light conditions (e.g. complete canopy cover and dark, old-growth forest stands) and the pictures turned out great.  My coworkers were very impressed with this camera, although none of us have photography experience, so our opinions regarding the quality of the photos are probably very subjective.  I haven't used the HD video too much, but have been very impressed and satisfied the few dozen times I shot video.  This camera is fantastic and does everything I want and expect it to do.  I do not wish to learn more about photography at this point in my life, and it doesn't bother me in the least that I haven't read the manual and so am not using this camera to its full potential.  This camera does an amazing job compensating for all of my photography 'shortcomings', and that's one of the main reasons I love it.

The exposure is probably about 1 or 2 steps too high in lower light conditions but can be compensated really easy with controls.Color looks just right to me. Neutral to a tad saturated, which I prefer. This is where canon IMO, they are a neutral to a bit under saturated.Picture sharpness. Varies. For me, its fine, for the pixel counter, it may not be good enough. If so, suggest getting a higher level camera.Speedy shutter, no noticable lag that I could discern, which is way better than most pocket point and shoots.The focus did miss the mark on occasion.It has an electronic view finder(oh for the day of optical view finders) which I wanted. IMO, in bright light those LCD's are worthless. However, if you point the camera into bright light(eg sunsets) the viewfinder will show flares. But the actually picture will not have them.The ability to change settings on the fly is pretty good. Much easier than the other cameras I have tried.The individual video record button is nice but not a big deal IMO.The lightness made it is easy to carry around my neck all day.Some minor nits to keep in mind--The LCD screen is not 'top notch' but its adequate.The video is MPEG or AVCHD(in the menu somewhere). If you chose AVCHD, and want to send copys for others to play etc, probably need a converter.Did not find a method to play back the video on the camera.When I hooked up the camera to computer, does not auto turn on like some cameras.Need to use Panosonic software to transfer the video's or manually do it yourself.It is not a hefty camera, but there may be a couple very long term durability(many years) items of some concern. The battery cover did not seem 'tight' and over the years may become very loose. The lense cap is not tight and can be knocked off while hiking or something. Recommend getting a lense filter and lose the cap.Doesn't have a panoramic help feature which would be nice(although a comment suggest there is one).Doesn't have a hot shoe, but at this level, who would need it?

We wanted something that would take quality photos, but not a suitcase to take it with you.  I think this was a great choice.  Camera feels sturdy, not too big, and easy to use.  I like how switching modes will tell you basically what it does, and the menus change depending on what mode you're in.  Learning the different features has proved to be very valuable so far.  You can just snap on auto everything, but changing just a few things with 20 minutes of education has resulted in better pictures than I've been able to take before.  One of the modes enabled me to take crystal clear shots of a bird with branches all around (fuzzy on auto).  As other reviewers have noted, no detailed instruction manual is included.  A little inconvenient since we immediately left on a trip, but I suppose it does save a lot of paper and it's perfectly easy to read on the computer anyway.  Well worth a few minutes to figure it out.Startup is quicker than any camera we've ever had (we generally have had Canon), and between shots is very fast turnaround.  Dark pictures are distinctly more grainy, but I don't know a camera that isn't.  Light pictures are extremely clear, and we reduced the setting to 5 MP to save space.  The on switch tended to stay on a lot, and we burned though a battery charge in a week or so. The video mode isn't intuitive (not hard, just not intuitive).Overall, we are very pleased with the camera.  Feels good in your hands, takes quality photos with plenty of options if you want 'em, or just takes photos.  The zoom is fantastic.

I won't reiterate what everyone has already said.  I agree...I LOVE this camera.  Its auto intelligence mode is photographically smarter than I am, and truly seems to have an inner sense of what is needed to produce top quality photos.  I am certainly not a professional photographer.  I just want to be able to easily take artistic pictures.  This camera meets and exceeds my expectations.  The colors are vivid and true.  The photos are sharp and clear.  The performance in low light is outstanding.  In my opinion, it far surpasses my Canon point-and-shoot in all of these categories.

I have a MAC so working with the video clips is not an issue.Drawbacks?  Yes, it may have been nice to have the swivel viewfinder, but I can live without it.  It may have been nice if the camera used AA batteries, however, the lithium ion is quite light-weight and has so far provided me with more than adequate battery life.  I bought an extra battery.

I love that it has a view finder (great for the days you can't see the digital display in the bright sunlight) and that it has a pop up flash. The settings are very easy to use and self explanitory. My 9 year old son is constantly using it so it's incredibly durable. Takes great pictures, has a great zoom. I'm not a professional photographer and have very little knowledge of the technical side of this camera but I can say that it takes a quality picture (with super quick shutter speed) and has a very awesome auto feature if you dont want to fuss with the settings.

I decided against repairing it and bought the FZ-40 instead. I don't wish to bash the FZ-40 in any way because it was probably my own ineptness, but I had trouble getting good macros with it, and on regular shots the AutoFocus was often slow. I ended up returning it. I started bidding for FZ-18s on eBay, but then I found that Amazon was selling the FZ-35 at an amazing price. The FZ-35 has more similar optics to the FZ-18/FZ-28 than the FZ-40.

I bought an open box model from Warehouse deals and it arrived in excellent shape.  This camera is very light and very easy to pack.  I loved my T1i and believe me, I would have kept it however it takes up too much space in my carry on bag and everywhere I took it, I stuck out.

I'm sure that people who criticize some aspects of the Lumix's photo quality know what they are talking about, however, for someone who isn't a professional photographer or who doesn't need to blow up photos to 16x20, I really find nothing at all to complain about. I've used the camera for action photos of rugby matches and softball games (from far away and fairly close), close up photos of nature, scenic vistas, regular indoor/outdoor photos of the family (including the dogs), and as a video camera. In every case, the quality was everything I had hoped for. I was particularly happy with the quality of the macro setting - many times, I felt that the lens would be touching my subject and I wound up taking a crisp close-up!

The available accessories.8. THE PRICE!9. The AVCHD video recording.10. The microphone.Cons:1. Battery compartment is blocked by tripod.2. The PHOTOfunSTUDIO 4.0 software is pointless.3. There could have been a paper manual, but I'm not complaining!So explanation of the pros:I love love love the RAW files! If you are unaware of RAW files, they are basically digital negatives. If you don't care about RAW files, then just take the photos on the normal JPEG! Moving on, the weight of the camera is extremely light! I can hold it for a long time when recording something handheld! The lens is a Leica lens, and is manufactured in Germany. It is a fantastic lens! The zoom basically sold this camera for me. I will post some photos of before and after the zoom. The IA mode the camera has is outstanding. However, I choose to use my own settings to shoot. The IA is made for the beginner! The other modes are outstanding. I love the Scene choices (beach, sunset, fireworks, candle light, etc). The night portrait mode is also really cool! The accessories are really convenient. I bought a UV protection filter(Tiffen 46mm UV Protection Filter), and I'm glad I did.I also got a Joby GP3 Gorillapod SLR-Zoom Flexible Tripod with BH1 Ball Head with Bubble Level for Digital SLR Cameras and I love it! What also sold this to me was the price! Amazon had this camera for almost 1/2 the retail price. The video recording is fantastic! I make videos on YouTube and this camera is going to support me well![...] Lastly, the microphone (which is located on the flash) works wonders.

I can take probably 500 photos with each charge. That's with flash included!2. The scene modes are absolutely amazing! I love the panorama assist mode. I use photoshop to put the photos together and it works out splendidly!3. The shutter speed! I make a lot of \"light painting\" shots!4. The IA mode is still a winner for quick shots.5. The fact that I spent less than 250 bucks on it.......6. The zoom! I love how it can catch things that are far away, unlike my other point and shoot type cameras.What I don't enjoy about this camera:1. The awful pictures in low-light...... They are really grainy, and sometimes the tones are off.2. The battery compartment pops off when I attach my tripod....3. The auto-focus is pretty bad. When I'm taking nature shots, it focuses on the most random things!I still hope you buy this camera. I'm waiting for the money to buy a DSLR soon.

I read a lot of reviews of the newer 2009 and 2010 FZ models.  I wanted to have IQ at least as good as my FZ20, and enjoy video capability as well. FZ35 has very good to excellent user review scores, but unfortunately I cannot give it more than 3 stars. If I didn't have the FZ20 to compare with, and this was my first digital zoom camera, perhaps I would have loved it.  However, each successive one I get seems to exhibit a bit less IQ, though more megapixel count. In 2000, loved the 2 MP Olympus C2100-uz 35mm equiv 35-350 10x zoom. In 2004, the 5 MP Lumiz FZ20 35equiv 36-432 12x zoom won me over, and I still have it, as well as the Olympus.So now, the FZ35, a feature laden camera with 27-486 18x zoom came my way. Like a couple of reviewers have noted, the aperture is restrictedly higher as one zooms, so that the ISO is bumped up and noise and diffraction results in the photos. Side by side, the FZ20 was noticeably sharper at most focal lengths. I got a hunch it has to do to with the small size of the camera's lens, and too many MP stuffed into a similar sized sensor. The FZ20 can stay at f2.8 throughout zoom if desired.  I missed the hotshoe, but that wouldn't be a deal breaker for me.Realize the FZ35 IQ is good, just not as good as my 6 year old FZ20. So, sadly, I'm returning the camera because it just doesn't represent an improvement over what I have. Furthermore, from the reviews posted, the 2010 FZ models (FZ40, FZ100) lose a bit of sharpness alongside the FZ35 (and I'm sure next to the FZ20 as well). Realize my comparisons were in JPEG, not Raw.Technologically, some great features are added, such as a larger LCD, and especially the 720p video , and the software is good, but I would rather the camera be larger if that is what is needed to improve or even retain image quality in still photos that the earlier, larger, FZ's had.The FZ35 is a good camera for the money, just not better or even less than what I had.

Got some great pics on a trip to Montana.*** My biggest peeve: a friend & I suspect a slight design flaw.I bought this FZ35 to replace the FZ7 when the memory card got stuck inside the camera.  I ended up using a pliers to get it out - wrecking the card.A new card slid in ok, but when I tried to remove it, the card became locked.I haven't done anything further with it.Instead, I found the FZ35 last January (2010 for $325) and quickly purchased it (all those snow storms!).  Love all the updated features.  In June (5 months use) I was taking pictures at a church function over the course of a week.  I was in the habit of pulling the memory card to download pics.  Mid-week the memory card got stuck.  My friend was able to remove it (with a pliers) and get a little metal piece back into place inside the camera so I could put a new card in it.  Now I HAVE to use the USB cable (included) to download from the card.  It still works just fine.  I just know that one day I may have to replace it if the card goes bad.Yes, I must say the FZ35 responds quickly! Better than the FZ7.  I love the high speed burst mode for capturing the birds flying to the feeders.  By just holding shutter down pointed in a general direction, I also caught approximately 30-35 pics pretty cool lightening shots during a Thunderstorm this summer.  I'm getting ready to take my kid's senior pics today because I have that much confidence in the camera.Just thought this little problem I ran into should be noted.  When this one quits, yup - I'll be looking at another Lumix - but I won't be relying on pulling the memory card every time I have a dozen pictures on it.Oh - on the above mentioned trip, I went thru 2 - 2 1/2 batteries a day with nearly constant use - hiking in Glacier etc.  I was able to get 2 batteries charged up in the evening back at camp.

Almost every camera that was recommended to me was so expensive and a lot more camera for such a newbie like myself. I could justify spending $300 on a new toy but anything over that was just too much to be spending on a hobby I wasn't sure I was even going to stick with. Even if I did enjoy taking photos, I didn't know if I would have any skills that would to encourage me to stick with it! So after doing a ton of research and getting some feedback from an owner of this camera, I went for it and bought the Panasonic Lumix FZ35. Even though it has only been a few days, I don't regret it for a second.It's quite a bit bigger than what I'm used to but it fits in my hands perfectly and is not too heavy to port around for several hours. There are a ton of features that I still have to get comfortable with but just two days after getting it, I went out to a Mustang car show and took about 300 pictures without even putting a dent in the battery life. Even without knowing all the features, putting it on iA - intelligent auto mode - worked perfect for what I wanted it for and I walked away with some very pretty shots.Since I'm eons away from being even a \"serious amateur\" - this camera is a perfect \"learning\" camera for me. It allows me to experiment with settings like ISO, white balance, zoom and exposure without spending a fortune on a higher end camera with all the bells and whistles. And the great part is even though I don't know all those settings - I can still use it using the iA setting when I need to!!So if you want a camera that's more than a point and shoot but don't want to spend a whole lot of money - you should definitely consider this one. My only suggestions would be to invest in a camera bag, a second battery and a tripod to save yourself a separate trip or purchase to complete your new hobby kit.

I have considered going to SLR full size cameras but the problem is lugging around lenses. My primary use is for nature/animals and sports.  This requires a minimum of two lenses and maybe a special close up lens for flowers.With this camera the range of lenses is awesome.  I have gotten a few birds 50 yards away and some tremendous tight shots of flowers.  Have not tested it with sports yet but it does have a burst mode.The best part of it all is the image quality.  I have been stunned by the quality.  And the image stabilization has worked flawlessly.  Even when I am standing on a hillside and trying to balance while taking a shot at full zoom it has done very well.  Obviously if you move too much at full zoom even the best image stabilization won't lock in a clear shot but it does work well in general.If you don't need an SLR and don't want to be changing lenses this is a winner.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Adam J. Brown \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R1AU8G18MUNRMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently picked up photography, and I'm slowly making my way to the world of SLR's. Prior to the Lumix FZ35, I used the Lumix ZS3; the image quality was good, the macro function was phenomenal, and many of the other features were excellent for such a small camera. However, what the ZS3 lacked was manual controls, and that is why I picked up the FZ35. I am able to make the necessary adjustments with a small joy stick, instead of having to shuffle through a menu. Another feature that is convenient is the adjustable AF. Try taking a picture of a bird in a tree with your run of the mill fixed lens. You'll probably have trouble focusing on the bird, with all of the branches in the foreground. With the adjustable AF, you can use the joystick to move the AF area, focusing on the bird instead of the surrounding branches. Another plus of the FZ35 is the options for filters and conversion lenses; while the telephoto lens may be over kill for a camera that already has 18X optical zoom, the macro conversion lens would be advised. As I previously stated, the macro function on the ZS3 was excellent...I could focus upon objects less than an inch from the lens. Not so with the FZ35. I have trouble focusing upon objects that are 6 inches away, but the 18X optical zoom does help to compensate for that. If you enjoy macro photography, though, the macro conversion lens is recommended.Overall, I am pleased with this camera. You aren't going to get SLR image quality, but as far as fixed lenses go, the image quality is hard to beat. Although, if you value image quality above all else, and you want that in a compact, check out the Lumix LX3; the image quality is unparalleled by any compact.The camera allows for considerable creativity with various manual controls, and scene modes. It's built well enough, but I wouldn't want to drop it.

Sometimes I wish the flash didn't have to be popped open in order for it to be available, but it does make one think about whether it's needed. Wish that the LCD screen would swivel and rotate.

Picture quality is also better than my old camera, although I must admit I expected more. Very likely because I couldn't adjust the camera for best settings, but the night shots were not very good. I tried raw mode and two of the compressed modes. Wide lens and zoom is very useful for close and far shots. And the camera is very fast even with flash on. Another thing I liked is that there are dedicated buttons for one touch recording, flash adjustment, auto focus, etc. The battery lasts long, but you might want to have a spare.For the bad part, I find it difficult to play with the settings, because there are so many, and I am not a professional photographer so in most cases I don't know what I am doing. It wasn't easy looking at the raw pictures on my PC so I don't recommend shooting in the raw mode if you don't know what you're doing. For the AVCHD Lite mode videos, there are some free apps for playback on your PC if you can't use media player (requires and AVC codec pack).

Editing movies. Although no digital camera can compare to a dedicated digital camcorder, they do come out rather well. What my complaint is about is the editing. There are two modes to shoot in. AVCHD Lite and MOTION JPEG. The AVCHD can be played on your big screen TV, although I cannot on mine, maybe not compatible with Samsung TV's, I don't know, but my bigger complaint is it cannot be edited on the camera, as my wife's small Cannon camera can. It can be edited on the computer when uploaded, but then cannot be saved to your hard drive, but it can only be saved to a DVD disc. The JPEG version cannot be edited, but can be saved on to the computer, as easily as it does with my other small cameras. I don't have any movie editing software on my PC except Windows Movie Maker, which does well for me if I upload movies from my wife's Cannon, but not this camera, nor my other, the Nikon coolpix. If you shoot a movie in AVCHD mode, and edit it on your PC, you have to keep it on the camera memory chip and wait until you can upload it to a DVD disc. To me this is frustrating.

I'm a very enthusiastic photographer and usually shoot RAW on a dSLR -- but dang, dSLRs are heavy. That's a problem because I love to hike and don't want to miss any shots -- but carrying water is enough weight for me. Turns out the FZ35 is the answer. It's no small thing (for me) that it shoots RAW; FWIW, the RAW files on this camera are far superior to the JPGs (even the high-quality JPGs have significant artifacting).I set the focal area to the smallest possible and have had very little trouble with autofocus -- only when it's getting pretty dark and I'm aiming at something far away, like the horizon. One of the things that's really sold me on this camera is that I've gotten very decent shots of Sandia hairstreaks with it. They are New Mexico's state butterfly and are tiny -- about the size of my thumbnail. I'm blown away at how accurately the FZ35 autofocuses on them. (I have to use a manual focus on my dSLR to get as crisp a focus as on the FZ35.) You can see a shot I took on the FZ35, of two Sandia hairstreaks mating, at [...]Autoexposure is pretty accurate and very controllable -- one of the display options shows a histogram *before* you take the shot -- extremely helpful. Not to mention that you can actually see whether you're about to over- or underexpose a shot -- not possible on an SLR.Two drawbacks to this camera (but it's still sooooo well worth the money): the photos are fairly noisy. That's to be expected due to 12 megapixels being crammed onto a tiny sensor -- that's just part of the story with most bridge/crossover cameras. The other one is that there's no macro mode that allows you to get any closer to your subject than about three feet. However the \"AF Macro\" allows you to zoom to the full 18x and get a focus 3-6 feet away -- that kinda sorta makes up for the lack of the very closeup macro.This camera is super light and doesn't take up much space (especially considering the 18x zoom and all the features). I took it with me when I went out to get shots of the wildfire in my area last week. Didn't have to worry about dust/ash getting onto the sensor like I would've with a dSLR. Plus I shot video -- the video seems really, really good to me (although I know next to nothing about it).Bottom line: Give this camera some serious thought. If you're fairly new to photography and are wanting to move up to something from a point-and-shoot, but aren't sure about jumping to a dSLR, this is a great way to go. If you are less new to photography and don't want to lug your dSLR everywhere with you, but feel limited by a phone or pocket point-and-shoot camera, this is the answer.

If you're looking for a simplistic review that anyone can understand...my review may be right up your alley. First, I typically keep my electronics for as long as they're functioning. I really don't care if I have the latest and greatest piece of equipment, so when I had to buy a new camera because mine was on the fritz....I was overwhelmed by the variety I had to choose from. I had tried numerous \"pocket cameras\", but few impressed me enough to make me want to buy them. The couple that I did buy, went straight back to the store, due to poor quality pictures. The larger cameras (such as this one) were either far too pricey, or, again, the picture quality left much to be desired. So, when I stumbled across the reviews of this camera, I thought that I should give this one a try. I am incredibly glad I did! When this camera arrived, I wasted no time in opening it (so patience isn't one of my virtues). I immediately figured out how to start snapping pictures. Granted, I had to let the battery charge first, (UGH! More waiting..granted, it really didn't take that long...but once again, I'm impatient, and I think a little added drama adds to the excitement of this review.)

If you want the flash, you simply push in the button, and \"VOILA\"! The flash pops up. Another exciting feature I LOVE about this camera is the fact that it takes picture after picture VERY quickly! (This was my biggest complaint with my last camera, as it was slow to take the next shot.) The optical zoom is amazing! I have taken exquisite pictures of objects that were too far for me to see well, and the pictures are focused, clear, and almost like they're from a magazine.  Though it is a little bulky, ( I personally prefer my cameras this way), it is by far, the BEST camera for the price! Now, that's not to say that it's better than some of those SLR cameras that a person like myself, will never be able to afford, BUT, if you want excellent pictures, a sturdy product, a nice variety of functions, and an easy-to use camera that won't put you in the poor house...then this is the ideal camera for you! That's all I have for now....I'm sure I have left out some important key features, but I am off to play with this camera some more, so that I can \"wow\" my friends and family with my photographic skills.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "One great camera!!", "Author": "S. Trudeau \"sueszoo\"", "ReviewID": "RV6PM30TSB75O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely LOVE this camera! I researched similar bridge cameras for several months before this purchase. My prior digital camera, although small, didn't have a viewfinder and I just couldn't get used to taking photos with just the LCD. I also wanted more zoom, which obviously this one has. (I wanted to stop at about 18x zoom because above that, including digital zoom, the photo gets distorted.) For its class (mega-zoom), the Lumix was the smallest size, lightest weight, got the BEST reviews from the experts and was reasonably priced.Although I had concerns when I read about the \"toggle\", it's not as obtrusive as it sounds. It doesn't rise much above the back of the camera, and pushing it in quickly brings up all the kinds of features in a shooting mode that you can change (by moving the toggle back and forth). Ingenious! Another button allows switching between the LCD and viewfinder. The display button displays written info on the LCD/Viewfinder, like which mode you're in and what it's good for. This display can be changed, or even eliminated entirely.The best part -call me crazy- is that each shooting mode (and there are dozens) is not only indicated in writing but also has a colored picture icon. Further, they're animated!!  (Like the pet mode has a dog which sits, gets up and wags his tail. Too funny!)While you could just keep this camera in the Intelligent Auto mode, I found it was well worth it to learn all the pre-set modes. My photos are a million times better now! No more hours/days spent in Photoshop. (You could also set your own aperture or shutter speed in the modes for those.)  The LCD and photos are of great quality, as is the feel of this camera (not cheaply made).Good battery life, although I did get a back-up one (FYI: 7.2 volts, 650 mAh). I also purchased a protective filter for the lens. (Did I mention that lenses can be added?)Downsides? Only a basic manual is included; you really do need to print out the full manual from the included CD-ROM. I would have rathered a hot-shoe flash, but this camera's flash is the best in its class (27 feet!).", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very happy with my Lumix FZ35", "Author": "GameMaker", "ReviewID": "R35387K4VYPWFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a digital SLR (Sony Alpha) which I love and use all the time, but in cases where I need a lot of zoom, or a lot of portability, it was not cutting it.

Alguard", "ReviewID": "RVH6VE7DU904Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched and read a lot of reviews before buying this model.  It seemed that there is no ideal choice in compact mega-zooms. So much is crammed in that there have to be compromises.  That said, I am extremely happy with this camera.  So far my main complaint is that the full user manual comes on a CD.  I'd like to have a printed version.  About the only other 'complaint' I can think of is that there are so many features and modes that you can't possibly use them all and if you forget that you set it to 'starry night' you may not get such good action shots of the kids b-day party.  The solution is to just leave the camera in its intelligent auto mode, but then I like to fiddle.The pros say that the picture quality on compact zooms is not the best but to my eye I don't see a problem.  However I did experiment some with lowering the resolution from 12 to 8 megapixels.  Comparing the same scene shot at both resolutions and each magnified to show the same small part of the scene, if anything the 8-mpix picture is slightly crisper.  BTW, an advantage of setting the camera to a smaller resolution actually extends the zoom range.  At 8-mpix it goes to 24X, at 3-mpix to 35X!The camera takes very good photos in dim light.

Elrasoul \"Programmer Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2EUW8XPGJDP9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please note I didn't write this but I have the same feelings the author had.\"Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FZ35 is the latest version of the company's gradually evolving super-zoom camera. Like its predecessors, this year's updates may only be minor, but since they're building on what was already one of the best super-zooms around, it places the new model in an even stronger position.Buy the FZ35 and you'll get a compact, lightweight super-zoom camera with 12 Megapixel resolution, a flexible 18x zoom with excellent stabilisation and very quick autofocus, 720p HD video with the choice of encoding formats, support for RAW files, a medium-sized but good-looking 2.7in screen, manual controls, HDMI output and one of the best fully automatic modes on the market. It continues to be a highly compelling proposition.But while the screen is good quality, it's disappointing to find it's the same size and resolution as before, and still stuck firm in position. Panasonic's own Lumix TZ7 / ZS3 sports a larger and more detailed 3in / 460k display, while arch-rival the Canon SX20 IS has a fully-articulated (albeit slightly smaller) screen.It's very important to carefully consider the pros and cons of the Canon against the Panasonic, and think about how they'll relate to your photographic requirements. We've detailed the differences above, and the Canon certainly looks strong with its articulated screen and flash hotshoe, but you may find the RAW mode, manual exposures for movies, effective fringe-correction and slightly superior AF and stabilisation capabilities of the FZ35 more useful. It is however interesting to note now the Canon has 720p movies, the Panasonic fitted with stereo sound and both feature HDMI ports, these rival super-zooms are growing ever-closer. Ultimately one doesn't take a decisive overall lead over the other, and it boils down to comparing feature-sets and handling for yourself. Suffice it to say both are great super-zoom cameras.While the Panasonic has the edge on continuous shooting and AF speed though, it's far from an action camera if you're into capturing quick sequences. If that's your thing, then seriously consider Sony's Cyber-shot DSC-HX1 or Canon's PowerShot SX1 IS instead.Should you decide the Panasonic FZ35's feature-set suits you best though, you won't be disappointed. Like its predecessor it delivers a compelling array of features for the money and easily comes Highly Recommended.

It 1/2 the price of DSLR and a very good purchase for the price it offers...I have surveyed and compared all Mega-zoom P&S; camera and the only one that meets its features/quality (may be beats fz35 too) is SONY DSC-HX1 at almost $100 more price considering the separate memory card one needs to purchase thats way costly than usual ones (almost double for same memory & class).However, like I said best buy for the given price no other camera comes close (apart from Sony DSC-HX1) like Nikon P90/P100 (very poor anti shake stabilization, poor video quality for 1080p or even 720p, poor picture quality and color effects), Olympus SP-800UZ & SP-600UZ with 30x &  15x zoom lenses (poor picture quality inspite of highest zoom avaliable, 30x), Canon SX20 IS, SX1 IS (use of AA battery instead of rechargeable ones), FujiPix HX10/11 (mega-zoom with CMOS but very expensive, poor video quality).This camera has amazing video quality compareable to 1080p although it is 720p. Has good seamless zoom with AF/AE lock and auto-focus. Best anti-shake tabilization and inspite of max 3200 ISO it has takes great night pics with least noise.It has great manual etting including RAW pics,which none of the cameras in it class/range has one. Its iA (Intelligent Auto) is still a great option to use for novice/amateur users where the camera does amazing auto-zoom, backlight compensation, red-eye correction and face-detection. In all a complete camera with more to offer for all kinds of camera lovers with great image and photo quality including color capture.Obviously the picture quality is not as good as DSLR inspite of its high 12 MP but pretty great zoom than standard lens of a DSLR.

DSLR cameras are too pricey for me and I wouldn't feel comfortable taking it to a beach or throwing in my backpack when hiking. Point-and-shoots are nice and all, but I wanted something a little more versatile.Enter the FZ35.The overall image quality is great.The 18X optical zoom (no digital zoom nonsense here) is wonderful. Even if you don't have a tripod, the image stabilization allows you to take markedly good zoomed photos.And speaking of tripods...metal screw mount, not plastic!The 720p HD video recording is a nice feature to have and works very well. An 8GB SDHC card (purchased separately) will record 60 minutes of AVCHD Lite 720p video.The camera itself is solid with a good weight to it. I don't feel like I'm holding a cheap piece of plastic.I do have a couple of complaints, but nothing too horrible.When taking pictures under fluorescent lighting, anything brown seems to take on some green highlights (e.g. cardboard, wood, etc.) I'm not sure if this is common among digital cameras, the FZ35 in particular, or my unit alone, but it's annoying. That being said, it's usually an easy fix in whatever photo editing software you may have.The AVCHD Lite codec support seems a bit light right now. This isn't a fault of the camera, and the codec itself is amazing in what it can cram into a relatively small amount of space, but as far as Mac OS X is concerned, well, it's tedious. iMovie will import the video, but it has to convert it to AIC format first, which can take some time. The AIC files are HUGE compared to the AVCHD videos, so make sure you've got some extra hard drive space. These AIC files can then be further compressed with iMovie or Quicktime, but this too takes time, so like I said, it's tedious.My only other complaint is more or less an annoyance.The camera can be hooked up to a TV via HDMI (Yay!), but it does not come with the cable (Boo!). Luckily, you can pick up an HDMI to mini-HDMI cable on Amazon for less than $10. It's obvious these things are cheap (don't tell me Panasonic can't get a deal better than I did), so they might as well include it.Overall, this a great camera that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for more than a point-and-shoot, but for whatever reason, isn't wanting to go the DSLR route.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Abbe Rookswood \"Challenger\"", "ReviewID": "RKMYJSGHS9VJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very durable and light weight camera.

In fact, because it is a digital copy, it is very easy to jump to other sections that you want to read by just clicking the page number. You can also search any word you want.

Again, the small sensor in all these cameras makes this not work well compared to a dSLR, but still the photos turned out pretty good.Burst mode is reasonable, slow compared to a dSLR (I have a Canon 20D), but about average for this type of camera.

It is also plenty wide for all of my uses.I have taken probably 5000 shots in the ten months I have had the camera. It has proven reliable, and I prefer it by a wide margin to Nikon and Canon branded superzooms that relatives have bought in the past year. While I have always appreciated devices that take AA batteries, this camera far outperforms any AA camera I have dealt with. I have been at events with relatives who have AA-based superzooms, and I have been able to get plenty of shots they missed out on due to inferior cycle times of their cameras. It does not hurt that I have been able to get additional batteries for less than $10 on Amazon by shopping around for them.The dedicated video button on the camera is very well placed. It is a feature I have not previously had on any camera, but it is an appropriate addition to the controls.

My daughter enjoys it more then her camera and is often using it even though its off limits to her.  Because this camera is so easy to use I at first didn't take the time to read the instructions.  Later I learned of its capabilities when I read the instructions and now I often like to experiment.  Before I was shooting in Intelligent Auto mode, and now most of my photo's are taken with the Manual or Aperture priority settings.  My daughter has more experience using the motion picture setting then myself, but I did use it one day when target practicing and I was surprised how good the video and audio qualities were.  The display, menu, and joystick are all easy to use.  The camera has an optional EVF/LCD eye sight for those sunny days when its difficult to see the 2.7\" LCD display. The pro's for me were the portability, the Leica lens quality, the 18x zoom, the 1:2.8 - 4.4 lens speed, the optional eye sight, the ease of use, price, and the general over all quality of Panasonic.  The negative aspect of the camera is that it is sometimes slow to focus and shoot.  Often I give up on a shot because it will not focus at full zoom, or will be too slow and I will miss the shot.  Setting the ISO and white balance for different atmospheric conditions is something to learn if you want to stay on top of this camera's capabilities and get a good photo.  Most of my photo's are crystal clear with great detail, but some photo's will appear weak in color and clarity, and I am not exactly sure why?  Recently I shot one photo upward at a tree and the sky was deep blue.  The next same photo the sky had a weak turquoise color? I like to set my exposure at 2 notches negative zero on my exposure setting on sunny days since I can correct the lighting on the computer.  If the photo is over exposed then its ruined.

Altough I was targeting for its newer version FZ40 but due to the budget I had to go for FZ35. I find the features on this camera pretty cool, be it Manual mode or iA mode. The battery life of the camera is simply superb. I had been to a trip for 4 days and did recharge the battery only once when on the trip and could click as many as close to some 1000 pics with charge still left on the battery.The burst mode on the camera is very good except for the size of the photo in the burst mode, the max megapixel is 3M when camera is used in the burst mode. Another issue I found with the Manual, Panasonic does not provide you a hard copy of the manual, rather they give away manual on the CD and if you like reading on computer , it is good otherwise you might want to print it out for yourself. But if you want to make use of the manual controls on the camera you would need to go through the manual to get good shots. I have seen many reviewers saying that the pictures are not good with this camera, I do not agree. You will need to read through the manual in case you want to get good shots using the manulal controls.Video qauality of the camera is good. I could not make the software play my video that came with the Camera in the CD. I had to find something on the web as a converter softaware from MTS to AVI/MPEG. But the conversion causes a fall in the picture as well as sound quality. Hope Panasonic creates other common versions of the video on its newer models.I had used the camera for almost 2 months and did not know about the extended zoom (EZ) option which I came to know only after reading through the manual. What EZ does is gives you an extra optical zoom when reducing the size of the picture.

The anti-shake feature works especially well, better than on any other camera I've used. And the zoom range is more than enough for what I need. The camera is relatively lightweight and compact for a superzoom, and can be easily carried. I did not want to deal with a camera that had a larger body or longer lens. The camera takes close-ups especially well.Unlike many superzoom cameras, the FZ35 can take photos in RAW format. This format assures the highest quality. The camera can also take photos in the standard JPEG format.One really nice feature is that the end of the camera lens assembly is threaded and accepts attachments. I bought a UV filter to protect the lens. A lot of superzoom cameras have no provisions for attachments.I purchased a Duracell 32GB memory card with the camera.

I was hesitant at first to get this camera, I did a ton of research because I really wanted the perfect camera for me.  My main deciding factor was, an LCD screen.  I have to have the option to use an LCD screen.  I'm not a point and shot type picture taker, I have to have everything perfect inside my lens.  The LCD is a bit shaky at first and the colors are off, but at least it has one.  I got a really nice cover for the back screen which helps in the sunlight.  I also got a UV and polarizing filter which work great.  I hike regularly and this camera takes beautiful photos.  For inside photos:  Possibly there's a setting that you can change so the flash always comes up, but I always forget to turn it on because I rarely take photos inside.  My old camera used to automatically pop my flash, so I'm used to never turning it on.  The photos are grainy inside with no flash.

The only two things that stand out to me that I'm not too thrilled about is that this camera can be sometimed. By this I mean there are times when the camera just does not want to focus. Maybe it's just me moving too much or something. The other thing is that it does not come with the little color thingy where you can color certain parts of the pic.

I agree that the ease of use could be a little better, but only SLIGHTLY so. It's like anything new - there is a learning curve to get through.

As far as functions go, I'm still discovering new functions because the battery died and -OH, the battery charger was missing, so I had to buy it separate. The battery it came with lasted me about 3 or 4 hours, I think...? Can't remember but it lasted me the whole show which was like 3 hours recording and taking pictures. The zoom was impressive, I thought. I'm not a camera pro, I've owned an Olympus FE-140, a Kodak Easyshare, and that's about it. I was looking for a camera with good zoom and image stabilization for a concert, and I got just that. We got seats on the side, second to last row at the top section at the Honda Center in Anaheim -and yes that's RATHER FAR from the stage. With this I was able to get clear shots of the guitarist -and possibly even his face if he hadn't been jumping around so much- the drummer, and bassist on the other side of the stage -would have posted the clear shots, but it's a text-only section. The Image stabilizer is terrific and the HD video is incredibly clear and close, considering the place we were at and the amount of movement going on around us. Audio is really good too. It is lighter than I expected, but I guess it's no SLR, and you definitely wouldn't want to drop it, it feels a bit fragile, so I'll probably only use it on special occasions. It has a joy stick for zoom and the switch to change from shooting to playback I thought was kind of annoying being used to pressing the shutter button for it to switch back, so it would take some getting used to certain features.

I would classify myself as a casual camera user.  My experiences were limited to compact/ultra compact point and shoot (P&S;) cameras and used the auto mode most of the time.  I was looking for a responsive camera that could take good photo and HD video at various outdoor and indoor conditions for a reasonable price.  I also wanted the camera to be relatively portable, and it should be flexible enough to allow me to learn and experiment different photography techniques beyond the auto mode.  My research indicated that the FZ35 fits my requirements very well.  After couple weeks of heavy usage, I am happy to report that the camera met most of my expectations, and I am happy with the purchase.If you are considering this camera, keep in mind that it is a P&S; camera with a very small 1/2.3\" sensor.  The high ISO low light performance is still very limited and is not comparable to typical DSLR (this limitation is a common characteristic of this class of camera).  One image quality issue that is not mentioned much in other reviews is the present of yellow spots/blotches artifacts in photo taken at some low light conditions.  I have seen these artifacts in my photos even at ISO 100 and they are very visible at 100% zoom (but you would likely not notice them in normal print).  This seem to be a common issue with Panasonic  image processing engine and you may want to google this issue to determine if it is acceptable to you.  Considering the functionality, image quality, responsiveness, handling, and the current pricing, this is a very good camera for the money.The reason I am giving the FZ35 a four star rating is largely because of the image quality issue associates with the yellow spots/blotches artifacts.  I just could not look past this shortcoming to give it a five star.Like:Responsive operation.  Good intelligent auto mode.  Intuitive control layout and interface that encourage experimentation (as long as you are not trying to do manual focusing.......).  Handy high speed burst mode with up to 10 fps (with reduced resolution: 3Mp).  Very good HD video capture.  Light weight and well build construction.  A decent build-in flash.  Good battery life and availability of cheap after market battery.  Photo and video playback with HDMI connection (using my Panasonic TV to control the camera playback works well).Dislike:Yellow spots/botches artifacts in photo taken in some low light conditions.  Does not come with a full print manual.  Lens hood attachment/interface is clumsy to work with.  Some of the icons in the in-camera manual are not readily understandable.P.S.  Anyone who is looking for a small case to carry the FZ35 should consider Case Logic DCB304.

I am happy with my purchase except for one small but important area.  The viewfinder is horrible for those of us who wear glasses.  I have never liked using the LCD on any camera because it seems awkward in many situations, especially when photographing sports, action, etc. where you need to track people or things that are moving.Two problems:  First the focus control for the viewfinder (the little tiny wheel on the left side of the viewfinder window) is not easy to adjust.  Just a bad design that is not finger friendly.  In addition, once adjusted, it does not seem to stay put.  But I can almost live with that.The worst problem is that this camera does not have a little rubber boot on the viewfinder window.  Such a boot is essential for anyone using glasses.  It allows the user to maintain constant contact with the viewfinder, in both the vertical and horizontal planes and also distance between eyeglass lens and the viewfinder window.  It also keeps the user from scratching his/her glasses on the back of the camera.It is pretty obvious that whomever designed the viewfinder window has never worn eyeglasses and hadn't given a thought to those that do.  Or else Panasonic chose o save 25 cents by eliminating a boot.I tried a rubber boot from an older Olympus I had in a drawer.  The Olympus boot did not fit the Lumix very well and fell off easily but even with these drawbacks it made a world of difference despite with not fitting well.  The Olympus boot is obviously not a viable day-to-day solution but it proved the problem could be easily and inexpensively fixed by Panasonic.  Why doesn't Panasonic make some sort of retrofit boot?  I would be happy to buy a boot and I would be happy to attach it it with a spot or two of cement.  It would make a decent camera into an excellent camera for those with glasses.

I am not trying to compare this to my previous camera, but rather note similarities in picture quality and movie quality without much use of manual controls, for instance. Performance and extensive set of controls is why I am rating this camera five stars, not four as I had originally. Any cons given are minor features that would have been nice, but given its price, Panasonic was very generous with this model, and every other camera I compared it to just didn't cut it for me.I purchased the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 because my previous DMC-ZS3 stopped working after a bad fall two months ago. This new camera is not a compact, looks like DSLR but can't be mistaken for it (lightweight, most obviously doesn't take SLR lenses, and quality far from it), and very good but not great. Here are the pros and cons (all I say here is the photo and movie quality is the same as the ZS3, which is disappointing compared to the photos samples on a site such as Photography Blog, but I might not be using the correct settings). Honestly, in my experience, I would give this camera four stars, mainly because (with any given camera in its price range/specifications), flash is weak (not listed in cons), and photos often aren't consistent even after the same shot. On to the rest of the review...Ease of use: Five stars--user-friendly and many different settings, very fast performancePicture quality: Four stars--very good in decent lighting but poor in low-light/higher ISO, but RAW will help somewhatBattery life: Five stars--haven't measured it but given daily usage between movies and photos, about a week before recharge necessaryDurability: Five stars--very well-constructed, comfortable, and lightweight compared to some cameras its size (possibly thanks to plastic)Macro function: Four stars--sometimes might not focus well but it depends on lighting conditions and the settings used for the subjectPros:18 X zoom is excellent for close shots, but consider zooming slowly and in decent lighting conditions or it won't focus wellAverage photo quality for a camera in its price range (low-light performance is near-average, expected given its CCD sensor size)Excellent HD movie quality in ample light (see cons for the same drawback as the DMC-ZS3)Image stabilization is (at least) average and works better than some cameras in its price rangeZoom noise not evident (or barely audible) while shooting movies, unlike most cameras capable for this function, very good stereo soundRAW support (but two cons with this format)Very fast performance (as fast as some DSLR cameras in ample light--fraction of a second in ample light, about 2 seconds in low-light)Formats high-capacity card (8 GB) in two seconds (much faster than other cameras I have used)Accepts lens filters (not included), lens hood (included), and snug lens cap, similar to those found on a camcorderCamera is lightweight and some people might think you are carrying a DSLR look-alike (design may resemble DSLR, but you know it's not!)Perhaps as close to DSLR performance and appearance you can get (somewhat redundant to the above, but does it really matter to you?)Battery life is excellent (or average--much larger battery pack compared to the relatively small battery pack used in compact cameras)You can use generic or other brands of spare battery (TechFuel by Batteryheads an excellent choice, and inexpensive)Cons:Can't record voice memos (you can on Samsung HZ25W, Canon's PowerShot SX20 without record voice memos as was featured on SX10), which is quite oddCan't take pictures while shooting movies (some cameras and most camcorders can do this, but will interrupt the movie clip some seconds)Face detection seems a little below par (often achieved slightly better results with the DMC-ZS3, mainly a tad less noisy on faces)Doesn't feature blink and smile detection that some newer cameras offer (such as Samsung and Sony)Movies recorded in AVCHD Lite look severely compressed in low-light regardless of quality setting--use the MOV (motion JPEG) insteadAVCHD Lite works best in good lighting conditions, but I am guessing to reduce the level of noise in low-light, compression artifactsRAW format is R2W extension, most programs like Photoshop don't support it (unsure about CS4--I have CS3), and slightly better over JPEGLens filters seem to have green bubbles when a very bright subject is in the field (especially the sun), perhaps common reflection issueUse of inexpensive lens filters that aren't multi-coated, such as UV filter, appear in my eye to give only 5% reduction in bluish tintNo fluorescent light mode (can improve indoor lighting issue), slight vignetting, slight green/purple fringing, and poor high ISO qualityHowever, in some cases, higher ISO looks decent enough for small prints (a little better overall compared to the DMC-ZS3)Can't take multiple shots (fps mode) in high-resolution; same for some other Scene modes can only be taken in 3, 2.5, and 2 MP resolutionSome settings in other modes (such as Intelligent ISO, Picture Adjustments, etc.) resets to default when dial changed or camera turned offI think this camera is very good, but not excellent. For $350 or so, this was a great purchase with many different settings, modes, and overall average quality for movies and photos, depending on what you want to achieve. Not much different from the DMC-ZS3, and that camera I really liked because it was compact, but the advantage with the DMC-FZ35, and all camera that aren't compact, you don't have to worry as much about dropping it as long as you have it around your neck with the shoulder strap. It won't be pocketable, but you wouldn't want to anyway if you carry lens filters and other accessories. Between a lightweight fixed-lens camera and a heavy DSLR with point-and-shoot speediness, you have the best of both worlds. I haven't used the software and don't intend to try it--all I do is move the files off the card to the Mac.Highly recommended product! If anyone has any suggestions on how to achieve better results, please let me know. I haven't used the camera for very long, but just long enough to write my review as promised (read my review on the DMC-ZS3, if you haven't already done so). The lens filter I bought with this is the Tiffen (the basic $8 or so type) and TechFuel spare battery. They work great, given any limitations provided. Make sure you have the appropriate bag to tote this wonderful piece of equipment around. Tamrac is an excellent choice--my father uses that brand, and I have a little one that will fit this Panasonic just fine. Of course, this camera isn't waterproof, but the lens filter and lens hood might protect it better if you are using it on a day with light mist or light snowfall. If the UV lens filter doesn't cut down on the bluish tint, set the dial to SCN and the Snow Scene mode will probably work better. Generally, you want to purchase the appropriate filter for what you are doing. Maybe spend a little more for a (better-quality and better-coated) Hoya lens filter. The UV lens filter doesn't seem to cut it for me, but that was my mistake. Good luck! Any feedback is welcome!I am planning to keep my broken DMC-ZS3 if I ever want it fixed. In fact, if you have the DMC-ZS3, you will really like the DMC-FZ35. They complement (and compliment) each other! For example, use the DMC-ZS3 at an amusement park where safety and portability matter most; use the DMC-FZ35 on a hike or in the mountains where accessibility and accessories matter most. Of course, you can use either on a tripod, and the screw-hole where the tripod mounts made of metal, whereas plastic it could fracture easily.One last question--can you use MultiMedia cards in the DMC-FZ35 as you can in the DMC-ZS3? (I don't use MultiMedia, and so perhaps this question isn't practical for me, but what if someone else uses them and wants to know?)", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "FOUR STARS", "Author": "Scrappin' in the USA", "ReviewID": "R9XBQWWKPYADC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would have been 5 stars, but I have to subtract 1 star for the following ...The BAD ::* Pop-Up flash could be a little smoother and not so jerky, but apparently this is the norm (as I tried, locally, a Pentax K-X and it was just the same jerkiness),* the viewfinder is useless ... when in EVF mode, it's like a bad movie version of the LCD (my old Nikon CP 4300 was off in aspect ratio w/ the viewfinder, but at least you saw real life through the window),* AWFUL over saturation,* softness (lack of sharpness),* LOTS of noise,* AWFUL yellow spots over the noise (probably not the highest quality CCD),* low light is the worst (though others say it is great),* no hot shoe (be in good light or buy a cheap slave flash specifically for a digital camera),* I do not care if the manual is on CD, but others might if they have never used a digital camera before.The GOOD ::* Lots of features,* a good buy for the money,* fun to use,* light weight,* easy to use,* small learning curve if previously owned a digital camera,* inexpensive accessories (like fun lenses & filters) can be purchased, not just the Panasonic ones,* love the PET scene & MACRO,* great macro (but I think my old 4 MP Nikon Coolpix 4300 was better there),* feels good in my hand/s (I can get some great shots one handed w/ no tripod ~ except low light),* great video,* really nice smooth zoom operation,* controls are easy to operate (I do have small, but arthritic hands),* the LCD is crisp and clear,* fantastic zoom,* easy to change the battery (which has a long life),* easy to change SDHC memory card,* has a tripod mounting hole,* very fast to save images to card (I highly encourage the use of a SanDisk Extreme III, class 6 card),* using the USB from camera  to CPU is the FASTEST way to transfer images (I also recommend Album Starter to encourage this process ~ I believe it's now included in Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 and beyond)I've had the FZ35 since the beginning of December (600+ shots already) ...

I checked all makes of long zoom point and shoot on the web and read all reviews of users and decided to give the Panasonic a try since Amazon had it for $249. What a great camera. I have so many more good pictures now than with the Canon on the Macro. I can't believe the shots I get . They are so sharp and clear and need little or no Iphoto touchups. The long zoom macro is amazingly sharp and the colors dead on. I used all settings and scene modes and they work great. I never used the flash even in the shade. I had no problem focusing in shade along the lake board walk I go to. I used the electronic viewfinder most all the time. Yeah its not the best but it was fine for me and easier than the LCD to me. LCDs are mostly useless in bright sun anyway. I wear glasses and I still prefer the EV. I especially like all the doors for hiding  the hdmi and usb transfer they all have metal rods not some cheap piece of rubber that will soon fail. I thought the camera seemed well made for the price and I found it very easy to use. Just don't put it on auto, there are so many things you can do with this camera use them or at least experiment a little. I mounted mine to a manfrotto tripod I kept from my Canon days and it makes a great setup. I spent almost 3 hours on the boardwalks today and got some fantastic shots without even trying hard. I left it on macro most of the time and I could reach everything I wanted with the zoom. To me 18X is just right as you lose sharpness with those ridiculous 36 or 40X zooms.I couldn't upload the video on my Mac computer but there are ways around that for what little video I'll probably take. The couple I did shoot looked very good on the camera LCD. Battery life seems ok to me. I took 84 pictures in about 3 hours of use and hadn't even budged the bars on battery use. The first thing I would do when you get the camera is go though all of the possible settings and adjust them to your liking. Check them all out to see what they do you might use them at sometime or another.  Almost all cameras have an online manual now except for a short book on the very basics.

Then again my previous camera (Sony DSC-H1) had too much noise supression.-Maybe too many preset modes-I find the auto mode tends to consistently overexpose, at least outside in the sun-Probably too many megapixels crammed onto the sensor, creating noise - 10mp would probably have gotten better results overall-HD video could be smoother-AVCHD lite video format keeps file sizes small but is not very well supported, but at least the option for heavy mpeg recording is there-Normal (full-quality) burst mode only takes three shots, and not particularly fast.  High speed burst mode is low quality", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "K.

I LOVED this camera when I first got it.  I took over 200 pictures my first month owning the camera and everything was beautiful.  The photos where sharp, crisp, and the colors were great.  The files were overly large, but that didn't concern me.The battery being rechargable was something I was so excited for, and the battery life was superb!  I believe I got all 200 shots that first month on one charge.The only draw back at that point was low light quality was not great.  But anything outdoors was amazing.In July the camera just wouldn't turn on.  Not at all.  I even went out and purchased a new battery and tried that, hoping the batter had just died.  Nothing.  So I called Panasonic.  They told me to send it back to them via UPS (at my expense of course) and they'd \"review\" it.  So I paid 20 dollars to ship the camera back via UPS to them in Texas.Now came the difficult part.  Waiting, and trying to find out information on what was going on.  I had a very hard time reaching anyone who spoke English clearly, or anyone who seemed to understand what I was asking.  I spent 3 hours on the phone one day being transferred from one customer service rep to another.  Finally, I managed to be told I was getting a replacement unit.About 3 weeks after my initial contact I did get a camera in the mail.  It's a refurbished model of the same exact camera.  I've had it since the beginning of August and have noticed a few problems that I didn't have with my first camera.1) When I have the lense extended the picture quality is 50/50.  Half the time I get a decent shot, the other half it seems like the lense shakes and I get a blurry picture.2) The focus on the camera is much worse than the first one.  If I have a super small item I am trying to do close up-the focus just isn't there.  I have to take the pictures further out than I'd like, and further out than I had to with the first camera.Neither of these are \"returnable\" items, so I'm stuck with what I have.  I'm slightly feared that the camera will break right after my one year warranty is up.  The upside is if it breaks before March, it *should* be covered by Panasonic.  However, a lot of online reviews later, I just feel lucky that they covered me the first time, there are a lot of negative reviews about how Panasonic deals with camera issues.Overall- I think I'll be looking for a different brand the next time I need a camera.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camara", "Author": "michael", "ReviewID": "RFAUBILK2HQIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a Good camera, I have been taking some picture and they are very good, well I am amateur so i can't give a good test of it, but was delivered in few days and I have what I have bought.

The images were soft and noisy. I recently had an opportunity to take a beginners photography class, and boy what a difference actually learning how to shoot in manual mode makes. My pictures are now nice and sharp, very little noise(unless of course you crank up the ISO). I've started to shoot using RAW mode and the pictures look even better.This camera is filled with feature I didn't really know existed. From taking pictures in B&W; to using manual focus(no there is not a focus ring). My daughter plays Lacrosse and the burst mode comes in very handy.I recently purchased an ND filter Panasonic DMW-LND46 46mm ND Filter and a polarizing filter Panasonic DMW-LPL46 46mm Polarizing Filter. I bought the polarizer to help cut glare and I bought the ND filter because I've found that when shooting outdoors in daylight, in manual mode you can't close the aperture enough, so the ND filter actually give you 2 more stops. Contrary to what people have written in reviews regarding these two items, you don't need an adapter, these screw right on to the lens. Of course it's best if the camera is turned on and the lens is somewhat extended.One final thought. I had been thinking about replacing this camera with a higher end camera, but the cost is hard to justify and now that I've actually learned how to use the features that this camera has, I think I'm going to keep this. If you already have this camera or are thinking about buying it, I would recommend a beginners photography class that will teach you the basics and get the most out of the camera.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "D from NY", "ReviewID": "R2ZJPSBKGF2KKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i recently purchased this camera after reading tons of reviews for months. Among other things, I wanted a camera with a good range of wide angle and telephoto. It's extremely light weight; some will appreciate this, others not. It feels solid but plastic-y at the same time. It's fairly easy to use and has lots of settings, most of which I haven't tried yet. I really bought this camera to take indoor action sports shots of my son playing volleyball. This camera did not work well for that. The pictures were dark, blurry, grainy and just lousy. I find that since the camera is so lightweight, it's hard to hold steady. I used the highest stabilization setting, but it made no difference. I also was trying to use the telephoto to get the indoor shots, and that made the pictures just horrible. I know that the longer the lens, the more light is needed so I'm guessing you just can't use the telephoto indoors without a dedicated, strong, external flash. I think some of my problem is probably user error, so I will continue to explore and see if I can't get better shots. Outdoor shots have been good, but again, if anything is moving, the pictures aren't clear. I read one review where they said they used this camera to shoot a picture of a full moon, without a tripod. I tried that, and couldn't get a decent picture, so not sure what I'm doing wrong. I couldn't pick up any detail. On the plus side, I find that the video is pretty decent and easy to use. Battery life seems very good as well. I have downloaded the pictures to my computer, but I have yet to print a picture so I can't really comment on quality except for what I've seen on the computer screen.All in all, for the price and the good quality of outdoor pictures, I'm going to keep this camera, but I am disappointed that quality, action shots with the telephoto don't seem possible, inside or outside. And, even though I bought a fast flash memory card, there is quite a long lag time between when you take the picture and when the screen clears to take another. I'm finding this kind of annoying. I'm not sure why this is happening as I thought I read that there was very little lag time.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Scott Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1PBBAUB1B51P8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a newbie and this camera is very easy to use and get great results right from the box.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a Great Price", "Author": "Detroit4ever", "ReviewID": "RGXQVFRHWDY55", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had Canons and Nikons, so far this camera has given me the best satisfaction right out of the box.

Can't get away from a green cast under flourescent lighting even though I work with white balance.  Perhaps with a filter this can be alleviated.

All in all, a good camera which appears to be well built and is ergonomically friendly.  Good zoom and anti-shake mechanism.  I was really disappointed with the shutter lag though.  I took a couple pictures indoors of my grand daughter and by the time I saw the picture after the camera processed it, she had turned her head to the side.  Very aggravating.  Shutter lag no better than my five year old Olympus C-5050. The Olympus was only 5 megapixels but had a F1.8 lens and a 1/1.6 sensor and took beautiful pictures.

Well, it is a bit larger than my older camera, but it isn't very much larger and it does so much (smaller than it looks in the picture)!  I've been using it for almost a year now and have found it to be the best Lumix I've ever had.  The photos are clear and bright, and the \"distance\" photo options produce really clear pictures even when it is a bit hazy.  I do a lot of close-up photos of plants and have found that the close-up lens isn't as good as my old Lumix, but I've also found that standing back a little and using the fantastic zoom more than makes up for this shortcoming.  And, I don't have to get down close to the plant (a plus for us \"seniors\")!  I've never tried the video beyond seeing how it worked, but one of these days I'll do it.

I wouldn't have paid anywhere near that for a \"refurbished\" unit to begin with.  Naturally I said no and just ate the $11 it cost to ship it back to them.  My last Panasonic purchase was a DVD/VCR a few years ago which bit the dust after only a couple of weeks too.

I guess Panasonic isn't what it used to be and they just don't care.  No quality + no support = no more Panasonic.Edit 5/6:I was wrong about the replacement cost, since the invoice I eventually received included sales tax that I didn't have to pay on the new item.  That made the refurb unit actually cost MORE!.  I refused, and they sent back (maybe) my original camera.  I say maybe because #1- this one has something rattling around inside that mine didn't #2- it won't even power up to tell me there's a problem like mine did and #3- they sent the camera back loose without the original box nor all the accessories I included.  The box they returned it in was big enough to fit 2 of the original camera boxes so I can't imagine why they kept my box.  I'm also missing the shoulder strap and since the camera won't power on at all I can't verify that the battery they sent with it is any good either.

It came down to this camera and the Canon SX10 or SX20.  I chose this one based on reviews, features and price.  I thought everything was great with the camera.  I took many pictures and video..uploded them to my computer, deleted my memory card and continued taking more pictures and video.  Big mistake.  I have a 64-bit computer and did not realize that the software was not compatable with my computer so my videos did not transfer.  All of those memories are now gone.  Luckily, I realized this prior to deleting video from our most recent vacation.  I contacted Panasonic and they said I should have read the manual prior to buying.  There is no manual to review - it is only available on CD with purchase of the camera.  I was told I should have downloaded the manual from their website.  I can't imagine how many consumers would download the manual prior to purchasing???  While I was on the phone I asked them to show me where I could find this information in the manual and they finally admitted that it was not in the manual.  So, the issue with reviewing the manual prior to purchasing made no sense anyway!  Either both people I spoke with were uninformed or they never expected me to ask for the specifics.  I also asked if this was an issue Panasonic was aware of and they said there had been some concerns from other customers.  In total I was on the phone with customer service for one hour and was told someone in management would return my call within 24-48 hours.  It has been over a week and half and I have not heard back.  They told me to purchase third party software however, they did not know of any that they would recommend.  I tried calling them again and asked directly for the man I spoke with, I even gave a specific extension.  I was on hold for over 10 minutes and gave up.

That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time.

The first thing that strikes me is the light weight of the camera. For many people this is a good thing, and I may be wrong, but I like a camera body to have some heft, to feel stable in my hand as I take a picture. Now with the electronic image stabilization this point may be obsolete, but I maybe I am too stubbornly old-school.Holding the camera feels awkward; my fingers feel cramped as they hug a too-narrow camera body. Button placement is also cramped and uncomfortable. In the absence of a focusing ring the task of focusing the camera becomes an exercise in frustration in trying to manipulate two focusing buttons and a tiny \"joystick\" to the right of the LCD screen - which is large, clear and a definite plus for the camera. But I was unable to achieve satisfactory manual focus using the joystick.To summarize, I was seeking to upgrade from the Lumix FZ20, which I had for the last six years. My main problem with the FZ20 is that the LCD screen is too small.  Unfortunately the FZ35's larger, brighter screen was overshadowed by its many shortcomings I mentioned above.Also: I ordered a recommended spare battery (Lenmar DLP006, compatible with Panasonic cameras). Notice - the battery works with the camera, but the charger included with the camera refuses to charge it, although the old charger from the FZ20 accepted it with no problem.For reasons described above I am returning the camera and resuming my search for a suitable replacement for the reliable old FZ20.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible Pictures", "Author": "D. alexander \"DMA\"", "ReviewID": "R7U0ZIEJ4LYGP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a Sony HSC5 with 7.2MP sensor and 10X zoom. Great pictures but I wanted to update and get a few more megapixels because I often crop and make large prints. The Lumix FZ35 seemed perfect, until I took pictures with it. I carefully set it up, enabled image stabilization, etc. I set the ISO to 100, the same as I use on my Sony, in order to keep noise to a minimum. On a bright, sunny day, I took some sample pictures of roses and telephone poles and other ordinary objects at mid-range and telephoto settings.Almost all of the pictures were blurred! I double checked the settings and took some more. Only about one out of ten of the pictures were decent. I pulled out my Sony and stood in the same spot and took the same pictures. Both cameras were set to the same ISO, same light, same subjects, same everything. The Sony pictures were uniformly sharp, in focus, with beautiful color. The Panasonic's were fuzzy, blurry, off-color or focused on something in front of or behind where the green focus box said the focus was being set.Why?I checked further and found that in bright sunlight with the ISO set to 100, at 10X to 12X zoom on the Panasonic was taking pictures at 1/8th of a second! No wonder the pictures were fuzzy/blurry. Apparently, the Panasonic lens takes in very little light (is slow) and the camera makes up for that by an automatic ISO setting which automatically increases the ISO to allow the pictures to be taken at higher shutter speeds -- but, of course, they will have much more noise. In my tests I turned off auto-ISO option and locked the camera in at 100 ISO thus exposing the very, very slow lens. I guess to keep the lens small and light Panasonic drastically reduced its speed, unlike the Sony which was able to take the same pictures at about 125th of a second instead of 1/8th.So, unless you want high ISO noisy pictures or you don't want to use the telephoto lens much or at all, this is NOT the camera for you. I'm waiting for Sony to replace my HSC 5 with a 10 or 12 MP version that still has a fast lens. Sony has a 10MP version, the HSC 20, but it does not have a viewfinder so that kills it as a possible replacement. I would rather the camera weighed a little more, had a decently fast lens and cost more than kept the weight down at the cost of having to take pictures at ISO 800 in bright sunlight.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "a truly disappointing one", "Author": "Wonderer", "ReviewID": "R1IOHCUKO5G57U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Excited to receive the camera, love the extensive zoom and 16:9 format.

The camera fits nicely in small hands, but many of its controls are too small to operate easily.  My major purpose in purchasing such a camera was for the 18X telephoto.  This does work (slowly) but the pics taken at the far end lose much detail and the lighting in the viewfinder is lacking.  The focus is slow (but this is relative information--because I normally shoot a Nikon D700 and the newest Canon Rebel with L glass).  So I try not to compare the Panasonic to these cameras, but just give my impreossion for getting close-up of wildlife.  This is where the camera failed me too slow to focus and too soft a picture.  Around telephoto 10X, the story is much improved with regard to pic quality.However, everything I shot at over iso 80 showed too much nois and softness, 200 up was pretty useless for me.I would recommend that a potential check out several other superzooms in making their decision.  The panasonic looked great on paper, but turned out to be rather mediorce.  I would not buy it again, but only had 2 day to check it out form one of those typical NY shady camera stores, and two days was not adequate.

While the zoom is admirable, the image quality is lifeless in JPEG format, and with Panasonic's wonderful invented RW2 image format they've managed to rip the energy out of raw technology. Funny, I don't recall hearing photographers demanding yet another half-witted image format from a camera company. The photos are grainy, with unacceptably harsh contrast.The HD video format gives you way more harshly ugly pixels than this camera might generate if it was standard resolution. Yes, that's twice the ugly! The video zoom speed (one setting: very fast) adds an extra dash of spaz to any video that you're recording.The included SilkyPix image editing software is the single worst image editing program that I've ever worked with. It's worth mentioning here that graphic arts is my job, and I reckon that I've edited tens of thousands of photos over the past decade using just about every program available for Mac and PC. The software and codec for Panasonic's raw format are incompatible with Windows 7 64-bit. Okay, so Panasonic is a year behind on technology. Who can blame them, they're working on brilliant new image and video formats.The lens hood is silly, with a turn screw to attach it. If you shoot lots of close-ups, you're better off leaving the hood in your camera bag. Unlike manufacturers who've hired real engineers, Panasonic has apparently no idea how to make a simple slip-on or snap-on lens hood.The full manual comes on disk as a PDF file. It is not supplied as a booklet. Hey, what the heck, you spend $300-400 dollars on a camera and Panasonic decides to deprive you of a 75-cent booklet (that's roughly the unit price that the company I work for would have charged on an order of saddle-stitched or perfect bound booklets). Have fun printing out over 200 pages on your computer printer with today's ripoff ink prices. Then you can punch holes in it and shove it into a binder, or try stapling it together so you have a nice half-pound manual to tote around in your camera bag. At least they include a printed \"Basic\" manual, which tells you how to load batteries, insert a camera card, and set your date.This camera is simply awful.

I already had one so this seems to be an easy decision. The battery is not charged so you have to charge it. It takes two hours to charge the battery. It has a light that goes out after two hours. It was right on. I could not wait to take a picture. Well, I took my first pictures but none of the pictures at close range were as good as my 6x lz3. It was not even close. The lz3 was much better. Next was to try taking pictures with the longer zoom. Well, the pictures are bigger and you can blow them up but I hit a big problem. I did not like any of the pictures of me. My old camera was so much better. In the range up to 6x the camera was of no use to me. This camera is not as small or as easy to deal with as my old camera. It has a lot of cheap plastic but so do my old camera but I have been very careful and so far have not broken anything. Panasonic has also released the new fz100 and fz40. The reviews on the fz100 are not good but the pictures I have seen look better than this. This camera uses so fancy tricks to get the effect that it gets. Any SLR would be better than this though unless you need the movie mode. I was so dumb that I did not know avchd is just for HD video. I wanted to upload video to the internet. It still uses jpeg for this. Mac's can't handle avchd but my pc is not set up to handle it either. I would still try the fz100 even over the fz40 on the technology that is built into it. If someone does not have another camera it would probably work as they would not know the problems. It would even be great for people with poor cameras. It would be a waste though for someone with a nikon d300. The low review rating is because of my poor pictures of me and small objects, in fact everything at 6x and below. This camera may be very useful though as pictures can be enlarged a lot and they look good as long as you do not compare them to a better camera. For the money it is probably not too bad a deal and for some people it might be a good deal.
