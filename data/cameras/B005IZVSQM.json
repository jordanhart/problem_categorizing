{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what I needed", "Author": "Fire4Effect", "ReviewID": "R2PY4DFXGMRPUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed to add audio capability to a security camera that did not have a microphone built-in.  I did not have an extra barrel type power connector to spare on the system either.  This device just plugged inline with the existing power and video connection on my camera and added the mini microphone to this circuit with ease.  Also, I found that the sensitivity of the mic was fine, contrary to another reviewer's experience with it apparently.  It is picking up conversations 10 - 20 feet away from where I placed it.  Bottom line is that it did exactly as advertised so I wanted to balance the review here with a positive feedback.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R2XM8ZOXV7D60O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this microphone for my camera; it can't work even in 1 feet distance in the front of it. The sound quality is pretty bad, and the cord is very thin and fragile. Buyer beware, stay away from it.
