I could do a write up, but the reviews posted on the sites above go into far greater detail than I could ever do and show comparison photo's to boot.  What I can do is give you my reaction to this camera now that I have it in my hands...PROS:1 - Super easy to use, out of the box experience. Pop in some AA batteries and you'll be shooting photos in just a few seconds.2 - Speaking of batteries they are the AA batteries you already have in your house.  I have kids so I am already using rechargeable batteries.3 - Image quality is great!4 - Supplied software is fantastic for storing photos - I love it already.5 - Fits very nicely in your hands.6 - Very intuitive controls.  You can jump from full auto to full manual with ease.7 - Very quick shutter lag.8 - Nice burst mode.9 - Functional image stabilization10 - 12x optical zoom is superb; 24x digital zoom actually works with no image degradation.CONS:1 - Low light focusing is too soft.  You will need to manually adjust for this in very low light situations (like taking a photo of cereal boxes inside of a kitchen closet with no light on).2 - Higher ISO settings are too noisy (anything above 200).  The built in flash will correct for this in many situations, but not all of them.  They could have used better algorithms.3 - LCD could have been larger, but it is not worth paying extra for (for example the H5).OTHER:1 - There have been some reviews here that have lamented the \"special\" USB connection on the cable.  To be accurate the cable supplied by Sony has a standard USB interface for the PC end and a standard micro-USB for the camera end.  The micro-USB interface is the exact same one used by my Blackberry phone, my SanDisk MP3 player and my Cannon PowerShot camera.  There is nothing special about it.2 - Some have commented about this camera is not able to write to non-Sony memory sticks.  While this was true for the first batch of these cameras that were released, Sony has since provided free downloads to correct for this.  The newer cameras come with this new software already installed.  I have a non-Sony meory stick in my camera and it works just fine.[...]", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "First Impression", "Author": "Danlib \"Danlib\"", "ReviewID": "R1PLY4LB5M13KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only owned this camera for a few days, but my first impression is WOW. I've owned 8 digital cameras over the past 10 years. By far this is the finest.  I originally bought the Cannon S2, but in less than 2 weeks it died on me. Before it died, I was very happy with the picture quality, but the Sony H2 is even better.  The Sony H2 also includes several extras that Cannon charges for, like the lens adapter, rechargeable batteries, and the battery charger.  The 12x zoom and the stabilization is what makes this camera great, but it is loaded with other features.  So far I only have three complaints. I found the manual to less than adequate, the menus not as straight forward as other cameras I've owned, and I really wanted to stay with SD cards. Only because I already owned so many.  Note: I am using a SanDisk Pro Duo Memory stick, and it works fine.  Several people complained about the flash on the H1. I've taken half dozen portraits using the flash, and they all look great.  I'm primarily a point and shoot guy, that likes everything automatic, and in the automatic mode things work great, but I occasionally need more options, and this camera has everything.  I don't know why Sony went from a 2.5\" LCD on the H1 to a 2\" LCD on this model, but the 2\" is much better than the 1.8\" on the Cannon.  I may add more in a couple months.", "Date": "May 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "High quality camera", "Author": "FED", "ReviewID": "R2LHELG7AY4LF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has improved on the H1 with an excellent quality picture format and the lowest noise level in its class. Yes, it only takes Sony memory sticks but I bought mine at Best Buy cheaper than Sandisk. Disregard DMM from Washington's rating as this person has been on every review I have looked at before purchasing my H2, knocking Sony. If you know anything about photography, it's there is only so much any mfg. can do with a 12x optical zoom with an image stabilizer at this size. If your looking for the perfect package you need an SLR with multiple lens, which is twice the size and price. I would recommend the H2 highly.

This past May I purchased an Olympus EVOLT 500 DSLR for $799  . I was not impressed with the quality of the pictures  . So I bought the Sony H2 . I can't believe the image quality . Perfect outdoor pictures under  any conditions . The image stablization works very well. I am able to take pictures with full zoom (which is the equivilent of 430mm on a 35 mm camera ) without using a tripod . Even in the evening the pictures do not blur .  The shutter speeds are fast enough for sports photography . The 2.8 f/stop allows for fast shutter speeds . The lenses that came with my DSLR did not have that wide of a lens opening . I would have had to buy a much more expensive lens to get 2.8 f/stop.The macro setting works exremely well on the Sony H2 capable of taking pictures as close as 1 inch away . In order to get this close with my DSLR I would have to buy a macro lens costing $200-300 .I constantly print out 8x10 prints from this camera and they turn out crisp and sharp with highly accurate and rich colors .The only area were my DSLR preformed better was at high ISO settings . The H2 had more noise in the pictures at high ISO . This can easily be fixed by inexspensive noise reduction software .The auto setting works great but dont be afraid to experiment with the manual settings . The metering in the manual setting will let you know if your picture is under or over exposed , so you can correct the shutter speed or aperture as needed.Dont fall for the hype of entry level DSLRs like I did . I spent $799 on an entry level DSLR . The Sony H2 was only $350 and has more features and higher quality pictures .", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "One of the best point and shoot today", "Author": "Audi Quattro", "ReviewID": "R3I3INJ78H9NOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tested it for few days and the image is just amazing.  For those who want low end DSLR quality and don't want to carry extra lens, the SONY H2 is defintely worth consider.The Image Stablization is amazing.

Some say 13X19, but I would prefer higher resolution at 13 Meg Pix.The ISO noise is acceptable upto 400.  However, the IS is much more valuable than high ISO.  I do gain 4 F stops as suggested with much better result than shooting at ISO 1600 or 3200.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "DJ Erwin", "ReviewID": "R5R6GMKOIX5C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently bought a Sony H2 after using a Nikon Coolpix 2000 for several years. I'd been interested in photography for quite some time, but the Nikon has no manual controls at all. That was all solved when we bought this camera. My wife still uses the automatic mode on the H2 (and her pics come out fine) but I do everything in Manual mode. And this is what you can do (*slurp*) in Manual mode:(1) Adjust aperture from f/2.8 (at the wide end of the zoom) to f/8. Not a superlong range (most DSLRs go to f/16 and beyond) but it works.(2) Adjust shutter speed from 30 seconds to 1/1000 second, which is good enough to do just about anything. One thing that's missing from this camera is a Bulb mode (where the shutter remains open for as long as you hold down the button) but I haven't yet found a situation where I couldn't get by with one of the longer built-in shutter speeds.(3) Both aperture and shutter speed are set using a jog dial on the front of the camera --- no hunting through menus!(4) As you change the aperture and shutter speed, the camera provides an Exposure value (0EV is what it thinks is correctly exposed, +1EV is overexposed by one stop, etc).(5) The strength of the flash (which is stupendously powerful for a built-in flash unit) can be manually adjusted in a menu (just make sure the flash is switched on, or the option won't appear).(6) White balance can be set to one of several presets, including a Custom setting (you aim the camera at a white card or surface and push a button to tell it what white looks like).(7) ISO can be set from 80 to 1000 (in manual mode). The high ISOs are kind of noisy, but the medium speed (80--400) work pretty well.(8) Focus can be set in four different ways. There are three different autofocus modes and a manual mode. Usually, manual focus on a camera that uses LCDs is a waste of time. Sony solved this by providing `peaking' --- once you switch it on, the edges in the image that are in sharp focus are painted blue. I was skeptical at first, but now (having taken 2000+ shots with the camera) I'm happy to say that it works surprisingly well.(9) The LCDs (there are two --- one on the back and one in the electronic viewfinder) can display a realtime histogram. Once you learn how to read it (google it), this can be a real help in deciding whether or not you're exposing the image correctly.(10) The camera comes with builtin Image Stabilization, which corrects for handshake (especially when using the long end of the zoom).(11) The 12x zoom (36mm --- 432mm EFL) is amazing.(12) Though I don't use either much, the H2 also has exposure bracketing and burst (high speed) modes. The burst mode is not particularly fast, though (about 1fps if I remember correctly).(13) The supplied adapter that screws onto the end of the camera has a 58mm thread and so you can buy 58mm stuff to put on it. I currently have  a bunch of filters (all Cokin and Hoya): UV, circular polarizing, ND8 (which can be used to take amazing shots of waterfalls), 81B (a warming filter), and a graduated grey. I also tested a third-party wide-angle/macro lens (which reduced the 36mm EFL to 18mm) but decided not to buy it. So don't be fooled into thinking you can only buy accessories from Sony --- lots of manufacturers make 58mm stuff.So that's how I use this camera --- in full manual mode all the time, and the pictures it takes are unbelievable. We recently spent two weeks in Australia, and when we got back we showed off the best pictures to my inlaws. Suffice it to say that my sister-in-law is now using one of those shots as the screensaver on her PC. And my wife tells me that when she zooms in on pictures we've taken with this camera, her eyes widen and she mutters \"wow! wow! wow!\".So that's the good --- what's the bad? Ummmm, not much. There should be a bulb mode. A manual focusing ring would be nice as well, but the manual focusing on the camera still (thanks to the peaking) works nicely. And one odd thing --- when I was photographing a wedding a few weeks ago I switched all the sounds off (the shutter noise and the menu \"ploink\" sound) and the camera misbehaved (when turned on, it would say \"please turn the camera off and on again\"). But with all the sounds turned on, it works fine.If you're looking for a good camera that will enable you to fiddle with all the manual settings but don't want to spend ~$1000 on an SLR, look no further. This is a really good camera. If you google for reviews on the net, you'll find several where it trumps its main rival (the Canon S3 IS). The best pictures I've taken with the H2 are jaw-droppingly good. And, in the end, that's what really matters.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Mega-Zoom Camera", "Author": "B. Cain", "ReviewID": "R30FZY0WQIEABB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before deciding on a mega-zoom camera (at least 10X optical zoom).  All the reviews favored the Sony DSC-H2 (or H5), the Panasonic Lumix FZ7, or the Canon PowerShot S2 (or S3).  I read many photography forums and found that the Sony owners were on average the happiest with their purchase of the DSC-H2.  The Canon has better video/audio recording with many owners complaining of \"fog\" in their photos.  The Panasonic is slightly smaller and gives a better photo quality that is only discernable to real professionals, but takes a specialized battery pack.  You will find pluses and minuses for any camera, but in my opinion the Sony has them beat with its picture quality, ergonomics, easy menu and button layout, and dependability.After buying the DSC-H2, I am completely happy with my choice.  I can put it on automatic mode and get great pictures, or I can play around with the manual controls and have fun with it.  I am an amateur, but the pictures I'm taking are amazing.Keep in mind that this is a big bulky camera (larger than my camcorder).  The bulk is worth having that 12X zoom lens though - I get outstanding pictures that my Canon PowerShot A530 with a 4X lens cannot match.  That big lens lets in lots of light and my photos look great.The DSC-H5 gives you 7+ megapixels but in reality most people will never utilize the 6 megapixels that the H2 provides.  The H5 has a slightly bigger LCD, but I've read that battery life suffers slightly when powering that large screen.  In my opinion, it made sense to buy the H2, a big Memory Stick, a case, and a tripod for less money than the H5 alone.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Stop wasting your time looking and just go for the Sony.", "Author": "V.

I recommend you buy this camera most importantly over the Kodak because it has image stabilization.  In general, most of pictures come out awesome, and the 12x zoom makes it seem as if the subject (birds/animals) were right in front of you when you took the picture.  Plus, the pictures are stored on the memory card in a split second so there is no lag time when taking pictures. Yes, there are more expensive cameras, but the pictures are not going to be any clearer than what this camera is producing.  Of course, if you do buy a more expensive camera, then that's your choice to throw your money down the drain.

I don't take a lot of pictures but I have used digital cameras for about 9 years.  This is the most complicated camera I have owned to date.  I've had the camera about two weeks.  I'm leaving in a few days for Europe and wanted the camera before I left.  Here are some of my observations.The manual though not detailed was more than adequate to get me through most of my questions.  I was able to find what I needed and answer my questions.I love the 12x optical zoom.  I played with the camera testing subjects at all distances.  At about a mile away I got a pretty good picture of a landing passenger jet.  I took very sharp pictures of an apartment that was at least 3 hundred yards away.  The images that were not crisp and clear (I can't always hold the camera steady) were more due to the 20-30 mile an hour wind and my lack of experience.  I found the built in stabilization quite good and I tended to get a good picture most of the time.I am no expert, but I found the image quality well within my requirements.  I was shooting using the 6 megapixel resolution.Pictures of my cats were crisp and clear and motion seemed to be no problem.  The automatic feature was good enough for what I needed.  I did experiment with the manual features and found I could push the camera to limits I would generally not need, but were quite useful for anything I would ever do.  Action shots were captured well.  I haven't tried any night shots yet outside, but reasonably I'm not likely to use it often outside.I tried the feature that took multiple shots rapidly.  It worked very well.  I haven't tried taking movies but then if I wanted to do that I would have purchased a camcorder.I have had no problem with the size of the camera or the location of the buttons.  I'm a 6ft 1\" guy with big hands but I had no problems.  The viewfinder not only worked well the focus wheel meant I didn't have to wear my glasses to frame a shot.  The LCD was a bit small, I would have prefered 2.5 or 3 inch but for the money and features I was not disappointed.I opted to purchase the Sony 2 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo.  This memory stick has a slightly higher record speed and this gives me the ability to take pictures a little faster.  I don't find the setup time between pictures a problem.  If I wanted faster speeds I'd pay a lot more for an SLR.  I realize there are cheaper memory sticks available but I opted for the Sony one to avoid any possible compatability issues.  I had heard horror stories about being able to take pictures but having either poor quality or not being able to retrieve the pictures from the memory stick.Overall I love the camera.  The optical zoom is great.  For the features the price is good.  The manual though not as good as I might like it was more than adequate to help me through the tough moments of learning the features.  I would buy the camera again.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "CamGuy", "ReviewID": "R3N5HT0W1V0FTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for just a few weeks, and still have much to learn about the many features, but so far I am very pleased with the operation and picture quality of the DSC-H2. This is only the 2nd digital camera I have used. The previous being a Finepix 3.1 MP camera. I'm still trying to get used to all the manual settings, but the automatic settings have been very impressive. I think the accessories included with the camera make it a very good buy. I purchased a Sandisk 1GB Memory Stick Duo Pro to store the photos. It has worked well in the short time I have used it. The minor criticisms I have for this camera are, as with most didital cameras, the compact size of the camera body make handling the camera difficult with my larger hands & fingers. I have hit buttons accidentally once or twice. Something added to the camera body for the left hand would be nice. The viewfinder option to compose a photo is a little dark & I find it is difficult to see peoples' facial expressions until viewing the picture. My eyesight is partly to blame for this, I suppose. The owners manual, at times, can be downright trying. I wish filters could be attached to the lens front rather than the adaptor/hood, but I can see why it isn't with this design. Still, it all comes down to the features the camera does have, the picture quality and the price, and that's why I give it 5 stars. I still have alot to learn about this camera, but so far, everything I've tried has worked well. Even when I guessed at the settings before consulting with the manual. I look forward to experimenting more. A person who just wants to point and shoot shouldn't be deterred by all the features. Just set the date/time and make sure it has fresh batteries and shoot away. Also, I purchased the 4 yr service plan with this camera. I hope I never have the occasion to offer a review on that, but with previous experience with a camcorder, I felt like it was worth the money.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony's memory stick is the only thing that keeps this from being perfect", "Author": "Michael C. Gillespie", "ReviewID": "R28XWXD7CWMKZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my Cybershot camera. The image stability system works very well. The memory used by Sony is the only thing that keeps this from being a perfect camera. Like all Sony digital cameras this one uses the proprietary Memory Stick Duo. Only Sony products use this type of card. It is popular enough with just the Sony products that most readers support it. This camera uses the smaller Memory Stick Duo which is nicer on the camera side, but most of the card readers I looked at only read Memory Stick, not Memory Stick Duo, which means you need the extra Memory Stick Duo to Memory Stick adapter to get the pictures off of the camera card. This adapter is included with just about every Memory Stick Duo I found, but what a pain to have to keep that extra part around just to read the camera card! the transfer rates are slow also, I'm not sure if this is a problem with other memory, but copying pictures off of the Memory Stick Pro Duo (supposedly the faster version) takes forever. Recorded video clips can't be played from the memory directly, it's not fast enough, and you have to copy to the hard drive just to view them. I also didn't find out until recently that Memory Stick memory is about twice as expensive as other media. I bought a 2GB Memory Stick Pro Duo on Amazon for my camera, I got a good price at $80, and now if you look, you can get a 2GB SD camera card on here for $45.I am disappointed that the best camera in the performance and price range that I was looking for is a Sony. If any other company made the same camera, it would use SD memory and it would have been perfect.Check out the competition and think hard before you buy a Sony camera. I love this camera's features, but had I known all of this before I bought it, I would have been willing to pay more money for a competitor's camera, if it had the same features, just to get one that used SD memory instead of Memory Stick Duo.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera....", "Author": "D.

I was blown away by the picture quality. I decided right then that I wanted a camera that had a bigger zoom, better night shooting capability, and image stabilization. Kodak fit that bill, but after getting burned with other brands of digital cameras, I was weary of getting anything else but a Sony. I did some researching and found the H2. Now my co-worker envys MY camera.I've had this camera for a couple of months now. I've had several smaller Sony DSC cameras along with several other brand digital cameras which I'm embarrassed to say included Vivitar. I'm rough on them and I take a LOT of photos. They ride along in my saddle bags on motorcycle trips, go to work with me. Well come to think of it, wherever I'm at, so is my camera. So far Sony has been the only camera to take the abuse I give it. I have a DSC-P52 that was completely submerged in water for a week (long sad story) and it no longer worked so I gave it up for dead. Several months later I was fiddling with it while on the phone and turned it on. Amazingly it came to life and still took photos. It resets the date and everything every time you turn it on but it takes photos just like it always has. I bought a DSC-P32 and liked it even more. After thousands of photos, it got to where it had a hard time reading even the Sony memory sticks. What I'm getting at is that Sony makes one tough and durable product. I'm just a tad more careful with this camera, but it still takes more abuse than the typical camera.Here are my pros and cons for the average amature photo taker like me:Pros:It's a Sony - Once you realize that memory sticks aren't the end of the world, you'll wonder why everyone doesn't own a Sony.Image stabilization - My hands shake something awful. If I ever become a surgeon, take my advice, go to another hospital. It's that bad. When taking photos with this camera, I no longer have to worry about bracing my arms against something to keep my hands still. Although I still have to use a tripod to take night shots with long exposure times, I'm still able to get much better photos than my cameras without this feature. You can turn this feature off, although I don't see why you'd want to.Adjustable settings - Although the average Joe only needs to use the automatic point and shoot setting to take great photos, this camera gives enough adjustable settings that even photographers who are way more advanced will be pleased. I've taught myself quite a bit about shutter speeds and aperature settings just experimenting with this camera. I like the way you get a brief description of what each main setting does every time you turn the dial. The on-screen histogram feature comes in handy at times too.Photo Quality - I'm sure there's better out there somewhere, but so far I've not seen better photo quality on a digital camera that wasn't a SLR.12X Optical zoom - Most of the digital cameras I had before only had 3X optical zoom. I would always just zoom in by cropping during the editing phase. I never knew what I was missing. I will know from now on. I'll never go back to less than 12 again.Video mode - I've not used the video mode much on this camera because I use my Sony camcorder for that. I did, however, use the video mode a great deal on my other Sony digital cameras and I loved them. From what I can tell, this camera's video capabilities are even better.Battery life - I use AA rechargables and already have taken more than two hundred pics. So far I've changed the batteries one time.Focus - There are 4 focus modes: manual, multi point AF, center AF, and the surprisingly handy flexible spot focus.Cons (There is only one and the reason I give the camera 4 stars instead of 5)Buttons - Although I realize that with more features it's harder to fit so many buttons on a camera, Sony has made the buttons on this camera more streamlined and flush than on my older DSC cameras. It's like the buttons were designed for kid sized fingers. I'm having a hard time with hitting buttons that I don't want to and not being able to hit the ones I do.I can't imagine anyone not being satisfied with this camera unless you are just looking for a pocket sized camera.UPDATE: I recently took some video indoors with the H2. After putting it on Youtube, people thought I had used a camcorder. It looked great! I also shot some outdoor footage. It was much better video than my P-52 took but still not quite camcorder quality. With a 2GB memory card, I think I shot about 25 minutes worth of video, several full size photos and still had room to spare.Since I can't put the URL to the video here, if you want to see what a great job this camera does with video, my name on youtube is the same as it is here or just look up \"Ride to Big South Fork\". This camera did so well I just may use it on all of my videos!6-22-2013 UPDATE: Well I've owned two other cameras since I bought this Sony, one of those is a Nikon D-80 DSLR. I keep having trouble with the other two cameras (auto-focus lenses stop working) so you know what? I just quit using them and went back to this old Sony and it still takes awesome pictures.

HOWEVER, recently I noticed the shutter button had fallen off rendering my $400 camera essentially useless.  I went online and searched \"Sony DSC H2 shutter button problem\" and found hundreds of consumers who have reported similar problems with this model.  Some even had two or three warranty fixes for this same issue.  I then called Sony customer support and inquired if there had been a recall.  They advised me that they are not aware of any such problems with their product. Since the camera is beyond its 1 year limited warranty the cost of repairing this cheap plastic button was quoted at an outrageous $141.00.  I explained to the customer support representative that there are numerous online postings from people who have the same shutter button problem with their Sony DSC H2.  He assured me that there really was nothing Sony could do except have me spend nearly half the value of the camera for a non warranty repair job.  Knowing that this seems to be a recurrent problem with this model, I am going to hold out and hope that Sony will have a recall for this defective part.

My previous camera was a little Kodak CX7330 with only 3.1mp and I've taken some awesome photographs with that little gem.  So, when I got the chance to upgrade I was very excited to get my hands on Sony's H2.The photos I take tend to be either portraits of people and animals taken indoors, or of items found outside, with some scenery and zoo animals thrown in for good measure.  My Kodak had done a wonderful job on the inanimate objects and other outdoor shots, but the awful shutter lag, lack of resolution and difficulty with indoor lighting conditions limited what I could do with it indoors - especially since my cats see no need to hold still for the shutter lag.  I was hoping the Sony would provide more professional indoor shots as well as much improved resolution for the outdoor photos, but I was barking up the wrong tree.I'm aware that I'm no expert photographer, but I'm not a total novice either. Even so, the photos I've taken indoors have had the white balance completely off, even after customizing it.  Skin tones come out orangeish and something about the photos makes my photo editing program unable to compensate without giving everything a blue cast.  The program has no problem with adjusting the Kodak photos correctly, so I'm not sure what is going on with that, unless it's that my Kodak photos are in TIFF while my Sony's are in JPEG.  In addition to the tone issues, at lower light levels the pictures become noticeably grainy, even as smaller prints using an adjusted ISO setting - and I have had trouble with some very pronounced streaks and patterns showing up on the photos in addition. (Such as yellow lines down the center of my son's face - not exactly something that can be overlooked.)  Also, I like my photos to be very crisp and the autofocus on this camera, as was noted in a professional review I'd read, is not as sharp as could be.  Especially in lower light situations, the camera strains to find the correct focus and often misses the mark.Based on what I've read in other reviews, I suspect the problem is that the use I'd planned to put this camera to just isn't what it does best.  Apparently, this camera performs well outdoors in bright sunlight, but unfortunately that's not where I need my camera to function best.  I think I'll hold onto it a few more days, study what I'm doing and try to improve my technique more, but in all likelihood it will probably eventually be returned to the dealer.  In the meantime, I'm going to pick up a Kodak P880 and see how it does on those lower light shots.", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted!", "Author": "Philip Wohl \"44Writer\"", "ReviewID": "R34FTZZ2O53WFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is exactly what I wanted!

I love this camera.I've been able to use it in several different situations:-Indoor party,  took some great party pics; with the fabulous zoom i  was able to take pics of the whole room from my location  manning the guestbook.  also the pictures process incredibly  quickly, you don't have to make people stand still for  forever while the camera takes the picture.-cousin's baseball game in the evening,  used the 'sports mode'.  great shots enhanced by the mega  zoom.  the is the only bottleneck in the process is that you  have to wait for the picture to come up on the screen and  then go away before you can see to take the next picture.-driving down the road (not the driver :P)  incredibly impressed that, riding 65mph, I could snap shots  of oncoming cars out the front windshield and the cars  looked like they were standing still.  couldn't really take  pictures out the side windows, but still pretty impressed.-outdoors in mid afternoon  comes with a hood thing that you can put on when it's sunny  outside to protect the lens, pretty cool.  i even let my 9  yr old sister be photographer some and she took some pretty  fantastic shots.this is my first digital camera and maybe i'm easily impressed but if you are the equivalent of a soccer mom in your picture taking needs and want a mega zoom that will take some excellent pictures, look no further.haven't used the movie mode or any of the manual controls so can't comment on those.  the menus were easy to figure out.  my 14 yr old brother picked it up and was able to change the language on it in about 5 seconds.since the camera comes with a usb cord, you can just attach the camera straight to your computer.  if you have 2.0 usb port on your computer and a memory stick PRO duo card like i got, it doesn't even take that long to download your pictures.  you don't need an adapter.  as for the software i haven't used it yet;  i just copy the images onto my computer just as if it were a jump drive.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "H2 vs. H7/9", "Author": "Alexis Razon", "ReviewID": "R2K0MCSTP22CD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a month, I've had the Sony DSC-H9, which should've been the better updated model for this 1.5 year-old camera. However, I must say this one still kicks H7/9's behind big time in terms of image quality (IQ). What use is a camera anyway if it can't take good photos? Well, the H9 takes nice photos and has more \"nice-to-have\" features, but the H2 still takes better quality pictures. I returned the H9 after having unsatisfactory results and got this instead. I sure am glad I did.There has been much controversy around the H9's IQ and excessive noise reduction. (See forums like those in dpreview.com.) The H2, on the other hand, has already built its reputation. One key note I noticed (based on reviews and experience) is that both cameras have the same sensor size (1/2.5\"). And since H9 has more megapixels than the H2, the ratio of sensor/pixel is lower in the H9 than in the H2. Bottom line: lower IQ. It seems to be that 6MP is the optimal value for that class of sensor.But the H2 does not go without having cons. It's slower in focusing subjects at the tele end and in taking burst shots (1.5/sec vs ~2.2/sec in the H9). It often takes a long time focusing on low contrast/dark areas especially at 432mm.The 3\" tilting LCD is also one of the things I miss from the H9. But the 2\" LCD of the H2 is good enough for my practical purposes. I use the EVF most of the time anyway. For me, the features of the H2 are sufficient: ISO 1000 is good enough (since I mostly use below ISO 200 and rarely 400 for such a camera as this), 1/1000 is fast enough to capture quick movements, and 12x zoom reaches far enough. If I demanded anything more than those features, I should've gotten an SLR.I am no professional, but like most of us, I can appreciate good quality photos when I see one. Maybe I'm the typical gadget freak wanting to take the most of my gadgets. I needed a camera that takes good pictures and has lots of settings to tinker with; but not so much that I would have missed the moment. Sony H9 would've filled that spot, but failed.Setting photographer skill aside, I can definitely notice the difference between the H9 and H2 outputs.

The function dial is easy to understand, and there is a handy \"playback\" button that instantly shows you your shots.The rechargeable batteries that come with the camera seem to hold their charge fairly well. The only downsides that I've seen with this camera are that it is relatively large, and the software that accompanies the camera isn't the greatest. The software has very few functions, and does little more than allow you to view/organize your photos. The software has very few editing options. These are small complaints, however.

My research indicated that one of the less obvious signs of a problem is that the auto focus does not work when the button is pushed 1/2 way. That is the issue I have now. When I push the button fully it will focus and take a shoot, but I can't set the shot up the way you are supposed to. Sony will fix it for about $180.00. I said no thanks. Of course consider this: many have had the shutter button simply disintegrate.

I bought it for my trip to Ireland in May and have waited to use it some before posting a review. The camera takes absolutely amazing shots (up to 20X30 if you want to get them that large). The stabilizer is excellent and has provided the ability to snap those moving moments without the blur (great for those tour bus shots).I had two problems while overseas. 1) I had not paid attention to the strength of the rechargeable batteries I'd bought (14 of them!) and they were dying on me faster than I could blink it seemed (okay, so they would last about an hour, maybe two if I stretched it). It was not until I returned to the States that I realized I had bought 2000mAh batteries instead of the 2500mAh that are CRUCIAL to this camera working for a long time. The Sony 2500mAh batteries last FOREVER so make sure you get that strength at least. 2) The flash for the dark areas that you set to automatic. In some cases the flash wouldn't fire even though it pops up like it is going to causing you to retake the shot (if you can anyway). I'm not sure if that is because of odd lighting or what, but it is the only problem I've had with the actual functions of the camera.Another thing to keep in mind: This camera is fairly large compared to many others (about the size of your palm on all sides) but it is because of the 12x OPTICAL zoom which I desire in my shots (best quality). I took several shots that are perfect poster pics and maintain their sharp detail at that larger size. If you are not as concerned with the clarity of your shot (larger sizes, zooming in, etc) then I would get a more compact size just for greater ease of traveling with it, however, this camera did not cause me one problem with carrying it around for over a week on my trip and it fit fine into my mini-backpack.

Because I'm a tough grader and I'm not the ideal customer for this camera. A dSLR would have suited me better but that was out of my price range at the time.  The Sony DSC-H2 did everything I wanted when I first got it but it is not designed to be upgraded and diversified with good quality lenses as your skills and creativity grow.There are so many good things about this camera that I'm going to start off with the bad.Cons- fairly poor scaleability, this camera is great for someone who wants a point and shoot with a HUGE zoom range but it is poorly suited for someone who plans on moving to an SLR.  It doesn't have a hot shoe so you can't add a flash.  The lens adapter is a standard size so you can add screw on type lenses but they all reduce image quality.- size, it's a big camera for a point and shoot, a camera bag is a must.  But it's too small for my hands (but the dSLR Rebel series are small in my hands)- ergonomics, the buttons are small and I have to use my finger nail to push them.  Some functions are poorly thought out (manual zoom is almost impossible to use)- what's this about a shutter button problem? I havne't had it but I've read about it... thought I should at least mention it.- poor low light performance, ISO noise at 800 and slow max aperture of F/3.5- slow flash cycle time- lens adapter and lens hood create flash shadow (both must be removed for close up flash shooting)Now for the pros- price, awesome camera for the money (paid $350)- image quality, outstanding with sufficient light- adjustability, it has all the settings found on a dSLR (ISO, aperture value, time value, full manual, presets. +/- exposure- video (poor quality but you can record hours and hours on a big memory card- ease of use, this was my first camera and I was shooting from the moment I got it- accepts regular AA in a pinch- 12x optical zoom with image stabilization, you'd could spend well over $600 to get a stabilized zoom lens (excluding camera) and you still wouldn't have the range of this little unit!!- plug and play, USB connectivity, JPG right off the camera, can print striaght from camera with the right printerConclusion - this camera is awesome for the right person.

A grandparent who wants a capable camera that anyone can use for close up portraits or wide open vistas.  A student who wants a capable camera to record their life but doesn't intend to develop artistic photographic skills.Who this camera isn't for:If you're a creative type who finds yourself holding the camera at your feet or above your head then I recommend finding a model with an articulating LCD.  If you're getting into photography and you want a camera that will grow with you then get a dSLR.  If you want a camera to stick in your pocket go buy a compact point and shoot.

I use this camera during the course of my outdoor job, taking photos of everything from closeup macros of plants, to zoom shots of wildlife.  I use the lens hood with a UV and polarizing filter combo, set my color on vivid.  I end up with detailed macros and intensely colored landscapes and skies (see my images for this product).The menus are easy to navigate and offer some manual controls including shutter and aperture settings.  The optical viewfinder mirrors the view through the lens and is clear and sharp enough to compose a photo, or to make sure you got the optimum shot.  Many cameras are doing away with their optical viewfinders, much to the detriment of outdoor photographers.  It is nearly impossible to compose a decent photo in bright sunlight using an LCD alone.The image stabilization on the 12X zoom works very well, especially in outdoor lighting conditions.  The camera is somewhat bulky with the lens hood and filters, which I always use for the effect on the skies, (as well as to keep dust out of the zoom), but it is quite lightweight.  I do wish it had a push-on lens cap for use over the 58mm filters.  The one it comes with doesn't work with filters.My only complaint is I wish Sony would offer this series with RAW capability.  At 6 megapixels, the image degradation caused by jpeg compression starts to become evident with images over 11x14 or so, making it unsuited for stock photography.Even with a digital SLR, I will continue to use this camera at work for it's ease of producing beautiful outdoor shots.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Bradley R.

One thing I must say is if you buy this camera, buy Energizer E2 batteries for it.  Before I used these batteries, the flash recovery time was very slow and it ate batteries like mad.  The E2 batteries are a little more expensive, but they literally last 5 times as long as regular batteries and are well worth it for the flash recovery time.  This camera takes awesome pictures and surprisingly, the video is very good too.  Yes it takes proprietary memory cards, but like many of you said before you can find it as cheap as SD cards if you watch for sales.  To be honest, I like this camera so much I really don't see myself buying anything other than Sony when this one dies.  It is a little big and bulky, but if you want a camera that takes great pictures, buy this one.  If you want a little toy, but a small one and you'll get \"toy like\" pictures.  If you can handle the bulk, this one's great.  That being said, it is not huge, and it does help keep you steady.  My wife and I take a ton of pictures in many different settings - low light, moving, sports, etc.  It will take great shots no matter what.  Again, did I mention the E2 batteries.  If use crappy batteries and they die or are going dead, the pictures will not come out good - duh.  Well worth the money.  Don't think twice, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  I bought it over a year ago and the price is still the same as what I paid for it over a year ago.  Sony must still be selling for $299.00 even a year later.

Takes great pics outside, decent ones inside, not too great of ones in low light situations (bars, etc - but I do probably have a higher standard than most people).  Have shot some great portraits of my son, and family members as well as skylines and nature scenes.  I like the fact it uses AA batteries so you can replace em at ease when needed.  The flash is about average for recharging between pics.  The onscreen navigation did take a while to figure out when I first got it (every model will) but was pretty reasonable and now I can get to whatever screen I need to in seconds.This camera also takes pretty decent movies as well.  In fact, I've gotten more and more used to the movie feature for many different things - including taking movies of my band.  This eats up a lot of space at the highest quality setting.  I wish I could post an example movie here, but you can get an idea of video & audio quality by checking out the movies on this band site (I set up the camera and let it play, keep in mind I had to compress so this isn't original quality but will give a basic idea) [...]So while there are many so so things and good things about this camera, a major disappointment has been the limitation on memory stick size.  I was going to give it 4 stars, but I'm taking one off because THE 8 GB STICK WILL NOT READ PROPERLY ON THIS CAMERA.  As such if you own this camera then all the good stuff is irrelevant if you want to shoot longer movies because Sony is not choosing to issue the firmware upgrade neccesary to enable the 8gb card to work in the H2.I guess they want you to upgrade to the H9.  That's too bad.  Apparently once you buy their product they don't care about retaining you anymore and would rather put the money into developing newer lines (that many people have said aren't as good due to too many megapixels).

We also got the Sony DuoPro 2gig card.The only notable downside so far: It eats batteries pretty fast, so have spares and be prepared to quick change. It comes with a charger so it's pretty easy to do (This could be my wife going crazy playing with the flash...and the fact that it is averaging 20 degrees outside...)It takes pretty good photos out of the box on automatic settings- we have not played too much with manual settings yet and have not yet seriously applied ourselves to producing that cover shot. Having said that, the macro is nice and close-ups are really sharp! Still working on snow shots since the exposure setting is kind of tricky and the automatic does not quite do the trick.. we'll keep trying this one.It's light, but not pocket sized- for us low shutter lag and good quality images were more important. We have had far too many rear bicycle wheel shots with our older cameras. So far it is proving quite satisfactory, even with the flash- we'll try some fast action shots and add on too this review.As others have noted, the buttons on the right of the camera tend to get pushed inadvertantly unless care is taken- however it is possible!Focus speed is quick and reviewing photos and deleting the bad ones is nice and easy. Controls and menu access are a piece of cake.LCD screen is working great with plenty of info that will more than meet your informational desires.I'll post more details as we play more, but so far it works great and has been easy to use. Thanks for reading.Ok a year later and how are we doing:The camera is still working fine without any problems. Battery life is not really an issue either. It has stood up to the 'beach bag' life well and taken a few bumps on the way.The focus system is the major difficulty we have had and this may well be our own fault- sometimes it seems like it focuses on the background instead of the main item in the viewfinder. This is a bummer as you may not know this happened until you see the image on a big screen. We'll keep playing, I have a feeling it is something we are missing in the settings, however it does not happen with our Canon SD1000, which was pretty awesome right out of the box!

I also purchased a SanDisk Ultra II 2GB memory stick pro duo. Sony listed it as compatible with the camera.  Here is the problem: My new camera does not recognize the memory device.  My old Sony camera recognizes the memory device so I know that the device is valid.  I emailed Sony and they posted a upgrade link at their website. I tried the upgrade and it didn't work. All DSC-H2 with the a serial number between 3500001-3534250 have this potential problem. I've been on the phone with Sony for over 2.5 hours and they have not helped me. Now they say I need a Sony memory stick pro duo.  This sounds like a monopoly and false advertising.  Besides the above, the camera is difficult to hold, the lens adapter is very cumbersome, the viewfinder is oddly shaped and gets in the way, the buttons are difficult to use. I recommend holding out for the Canon IS3 and not buying DSC-H2 or DSC-H3.  Sony obviously has not spent the time to fully review their product and work out all the glitches.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Buena calidad. Bajo precio", "Author": "Jaime M.

The camera was used four weeks before returning back to Sony.I was looking to upgrade from my Canon G5 to something with a little more flexibility and features for a vacation I was going to take. Although tempted, I decided not to leap to a DSLR. Based upon research and initial reviews,  prior to its release from Sony I ordered Sony Cyber Shot DSC-H2 and its full range of accessories (Telephoto, wide-angle, micro-lenses, etc). Initially I had few problems, but on the first full day of my European vacation the DSC-H2's Shutter Button disintegrated making the camera completely useless for the rest of vacation.  I regret buying it and if you buy this camera so will you.ProNone: The Sony Cyber Shot DSC-H2 fell apart before I could find any.Con:So what were the problems I encountered when trying to use DSC-H2?1). Batteries Problems: Two Sony Stamina NiMH batteries that came with the DSC-H2 were defective and would not take a charge. I had to buy my own batteries before I could even begin to use the camera. DSC-H2 seemed to drain batteries at a higher rate than what specifications stated it would. Length of battery charging cycle seem excessive.2).  Extremely flimsy  construction. Several weeks after receiving the camera, on the first full day of my vacation after only three pictures, the DSC-H2's Shutter Button completely disintegrated. No Shutter Button and no pictures. When Sony refused to deal with this problem at all, I was forced to buy another digital camera in Europe to take my pictures. Being completely useless for taking pictures, the DSC-H2 and all of its accessories just took up space and remained in my luggage. See my comments about Sony Customer Support on trying to resolve this and other problems associated with this camera. 3). SanDisk 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo \"Reinsert memory card\" error . When looking at the camera I believed Sony statement that DSC-H2 was compatible with SanDisk 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo. I bought three of them for a vacation to Europe. They were completely worthless.  It must be assumed Sony had tested the DSC-H2 and was aware of this defect before market and sold the camera to general public.  See my comments about Sony Customer Support on trying to resolve this and other problems associated with this camera.4). Super SteadyShot\u00ae stabilization did not work 20% of time. Some images so blurred you could not tell what they were.5). Image Noise. Some at ISO 200. Noticeable at ISO 400.  Noise levels at ISO 800 made most images unusable.6). Zoom Pixalization. Use of zoom caused a significant degree of pixalization which was especially noticeable at 10x and up. I don't care how big your telephoto capability- if it is distorted or you can not use the image- what good is it.7). Wide Angle Lense Chromatic aberration and distortion. When using Sony wide angle lense experienced purple fringe and peripheral distortion of images. Some is to be expected, but this was excessive.8).  Autofocus:  In short time I had and used camera, some minor problems developed with autofocus (it would intermittently stopped working and I had to do it manually). With this starting to occur with the DSC-H2 brand new, there is no telling how extensive it would have become over time.9) . DSC-H2  Ergonomics: Camera fatigue quickly becomes a problem. I found the camera awkward and difficult to hold. With the bulk and weight close to that of a DSLR, but with none of the advantages. The lens adapter is very cumbersome. The various control and function buttons are oddly placed and most are difficult to access and use.10). Flash takes longer than normal to recharge. The result was missing a number of what would have been some great pictures.11). Small LCD monitor 2.5 inches. It was very difficult to see in direct sunlight. Made image composition rather difficult.12). Overall Image Quality: I can sum it up in two words- Extremely Disappointing! Based upon initial reviews I had a certain level of expectation. But when I compared several images of Swiss mountains that was taken at the same time and under same light conditions, my daughter's 4 megapixel camera produces equivalent and in some cases better images than 6 megapixel DSC-H2. When compared with my old 5 megapixel Canon G5, there can be no real comparison. DSC-H2 is not even in the same league.13). Sony Customer Support- Based upon over 20 hours (5 of which were spent calling long distance from Switzerland) of dealing with these individuals during the process of trying to resolve this problem I found that when it comes to Sony and product support you are on your own. If you have a problem with their products- its your problem and not theirs. I found Sony Customer Support to be incompetent, lazy, purposely provide you with misinformation, out-right-lie to you, high degree of ignorance, empty promises and refusal of  mid-level supervisors to do their job, supervisors who seemed to be on a power trip, frustration. Etc. etc. Instead of trying to help solve problem- they became a major part of the problem. They tried to wear you down and make you give up.ConclusionI had great hopes for the DSC-H2 when I bought it. But because of all of the above, The day when Hell freezes over will be the day I buy another Sony camera.
