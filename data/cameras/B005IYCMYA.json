{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome camera, kit is so so", "Author": "Michigander \"Yoda\"", "ReviewID": "R3DV6AGEBOLBV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will not be writing the merits / demerits of the product itself. I guess there are multiple sites already offering that info. What I will write about is my experience with the seller (Sunset Electronics) and some general info on the kit.The item arrived well packaged. A few things were left out (manuals for the camera, lenses, wrong tripod, cleaning kit missing) which the seller promptly shipped out the next day. One thing to note though is that the camera seems to be from the gray market (serial number ends with a \"C\", maybe for sale in 'China'). A little surprised that Amazon would allow their marketplace vendors to sell items meant for sale in other countries (& hence the lower price, I guess). In any case, when I spoke with the CS dept, they acknowledged the fact that the camera was retail and that any warranty issues would need to go thru their store, and that I would not be able to resolve directly with Nikon. Registering the cam and lenses online wasn't a problem. Good experience overall.I would recommend that other folks first check with the retailer on the product details and then make up your mind. Camera is awesome and the kit lenses, etc are ok (managed my expectations upfront) but will satisfy any novice users (like me!).I will update the review in a few months with my experience. Meanwhile, happy clicking!!*****************************************************************Update June 20, 2013 - Camera continues to perform without any hiccups. Looks like Sunset electronics is back with their d7000 kit option on Amazon ;-) ...I've never used any of the misc items (telephoto lens, tripod, lens strap....) that came with the kit. Did get a good quality tripod, a better, longer, & inconspicuous shoulder strap and have been quite happy thus far!!", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good bundle", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R2LJMT0DZ7GITA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this bundle and am extremely satisfied with the service provided by Sunset Electronics. The 200mm lense was back ordered but arrived without incident. If you are like me and just getting into a camera that is beyond point and shoot, this is a great way to go but you will probably want to invest in a DVD to get you up to speed.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Left Out Information", "Author": "Ben R", "ReviewID": "R1XGIHBW418I8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon D7000 16.2MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)This is the first time I ever write a review . I'am very Happy with the delivery & everything was package great, the only thing that got me upset was when I went to the Nikon website to registered the products that I received. When I typed in the Serial Number of the camera and entered it, a popup stated\" The serial number you entered does not appear to be valid \" and Your camera may be a \"Gray Market\" camera. What is \"Gray Market\" ? Generally, a manufacturer works with a single importer who can sell and support their products in a given region. The importer usually has local dealers and distributors who resell the imported products; this is called a \"distribution channel\". Gray Market refers to merchandise that is imported and sold by methods other than these normal channels. Because the reseller cost is less they can sell Gray Market items for less. Unfortunately this price savings is only on the initial purchase; because service and support is more difficult to obtain it may end up costing the consumer more in the long run. What does owning a \"Gray Market\" Nikon product mean to you? Nikon Inc. USA cannot provide any technical support or warranty service on Gray Market items. Additionally Nikon Inc. USA cannot perform any fee-based repair work on Gray Market items. If you own a Gray Market product it will need to be returned to the reseller or importer for service, GOOD LUCK on that!It would have been GREAT TO KNOW that the D7000 was a Gray Market product that way it's would have been my decision to take the risk to buy it or not.
