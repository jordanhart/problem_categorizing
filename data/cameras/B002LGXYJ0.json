{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great Camera with a ton of features! Also SUPER COOL!!", "Author": "Ryan S. Martin", "ReviewID": "R2865ZTDGYCSFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would guess that ninety percent of you reading these reviews are prospective digital camera buyers. You are reading these honest reviews by average people in an effort to learn more about buying this camera, you're asking that question \"Is the dual-view TL225 right for me?\" I don't know if it is, but keep in mind as you're reading my review that I'm writing this review for you because I was you the perspective buyer with numerous questions and concerns just one week ago.Comparatively this Camera does not take the best picture of all the camera's in its price range. (The sub $300 digital camera category.) There are other camera's in the TL225's price range the give a better representation of color, perform better in low lighting, take better action photographs, take higher resolution HD movies or are smaller and possibly more convenient in some ways. The TL225 is not the pinnacle of digital photography in any category that I could find. It is however, on par with or above average for its class in just about every category; from iso, to HD-Movie capabilities, picture resolution, delay time between taking pictures, and etc. Make no mistake, this camera is no chump! It's just not a champion in any particular category. Overall I think it's the best fit for the average person that needs a digital camera for taking pictures of nights out, sight seeing, family events, etc. It's also quite sleek, I might suggest, nay, I implore you go to bestbuy and see just how sleek this device is before buying it.Some of the other reviewers have been a bit harsh. I wonder however, how many digital cameras they have owned in their life. If the answer is 1 or 2, then they really aren't in a position to make accurate criticisms of this device. Or, perhaps they are, but only after they actually read the owner's manual. By reading this owner's manual, which, btw, is very detailed and can be downloaded from Samsung's website (in pdf form so you easily browse to whatever section you'd like to read about); you'll find the answer's to many of the little questions/problems/concerns you've had about this device! You can even read the owner's manual before you buy the TL225! Egads man!As opposed to the aforementioned negative reviewers, I however, love this camera! This is an excellent replacement for the Kodak EasyShare P.0.S. that I had before. The TL225 comes with a ton of features on board. There's a slide show you can setup with a push of button, there's red-eye removal (which you can activate both before and after you take pics), blemish removal, and a ton other effects you can put on the pictures without having to even transfer the photos to your PC. The touch screen is very responsive and the dual view front screen works as advertised.With its 12.2 megapixel sensor this camera takes some beautiful pictures. It also takes excellent HD movies recording them at 720p and you have the ability to zoom while recording the movies (a lot digital cameras can't do that or if they do you'll get this buzzing noise while zooming (This camera makes no such noises!)).There's a bunch of on board features for the movies too after you've recorded them so you can edit them, just like the photos (brighten, trim movies, etc) on the camera without transferring them to your PC. I can't talk enough about how many little convenient features are included on board this camera, and they are just all so easy to find with the little pop-up menus. These features are why this camera is a \"must own\" 5 out 5 star device! Well, haha, that and it takes some pretty darn good pictures too!Previous reviewers have complained about blurry photographs, well the first thing is to check the ISO level. If you know you are shooting in a dark room and are not using flash, turn the iso up manually. Yes, the auto features are good but not perfect, conventional wisdom says \"the great carpenter never blames his tools\". There's really something to be said for that, basically, ya know have a brain people! And two, play with your camera, enjoy it before you take it out and use it for your real world events. This camera has a lot of features but you have to use the right one for the job and know all the tools it has to offer and how to use them.***NOTE*** Digital Camera's and HD Camera's as a whole don't tend to perform as well in low lighting as your regular film camera's they have come a long way and the technology is developing but this isn't a $500-600 professional camera, this a sub-compact point and shoot camera, keep that in mind when grading.The other thing is this camera has pre-set features that come turned on that you can turn off which will help/hurt picture quality. One of them is facial recognition if this is on and if you are not taking a picture of someone or not trying focus on a face it will cause the picture to come out blurry. That's just the way the software on the camera is written. So you need to make sure you have the camera set in the correct modes. Furthermore, this all goes back to reading the manual and playing with your camera for awhile when you first get it.To address some of the other concerns:-- The battery life sucks, SUPRISE! Welcome to the world of portable electronics. I suggest only turning on the dual-view then you need it (this is the major batter drainer) and I also suggest buying another battery and the external battery charger.-- Yes, it also sucks that this camera comes bare bones without a Micro-SD card, additional battery, or some the other nifty accessories you might need. What are you gonna do? I bought all the additional items (extra battery, charger, case, and micro-SD) and it only cost me $30.00.-- The fact that it uses a micro-SD at all is also kind of annoying. While I think they could have tried to fit a standard SD in this camera, I'm glad they didn't. It's very sleek and stylish, slim and sexy. I guess having to use micro-SD is the price of beauty.-- You need to buy a $50 dock to connect this camera to your TV using HDMI. Yes this is certainly frustrating, especially since one of the touted features of the TL225 is it's HDMI out, but really who cares? You can buy a USB adapter for your micro-SD and just plug it into your HDTV or PS3 directly.**SIDENOTES** If you are debating between TL225 and the TL220, I'd say it's worth it to pony up the extra $20-25 for the TL225. The rear LCD screen is a bit bigger on this camera and the resolution on that LCD is much higher so you'll a have more accurate representation of your pictures after you take them. Also just having a larger, higher resolution screen will just add to the wow factor when you show this camera off to your friends. Another note, the orange color that the TL225 comes in is really more of a Red than an Orange; you'll see what I mean when you behold this camera in person. Sorry cuse' fans!BOTTOM LINE:This camera is great, if you are looking for a sleek point and shoot digital camera with a ton of features. The TL225 takes reasonably good pictures when compared to others in the same price range but where this digital camera really excels is by ease of use and innovative design with its responsive touch screen, pop-up menus, plethora of on-board features and cool dual view LCD. 5 stars!", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fun, Fast Camera, Poor Image Quality", "Author": "Brian Mantel \"Kevlar\"", "ReviewID": "R346AR2ANULUSV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My previous camera was a 4MegaPixel Canon S410 which I purchased about 7 years ago.  I figured it was time for an upgrade and first I purchased a 12.2 MegaPixel Canon SD980 which is about this same price as the Samsung TL225 and also has a large touch screen.  The features and touch UI weren't nearly as good as the TL225.  The picture quality of the SD980 was poor and after looking more closely at reviews, I realized I wasn't the only one having issues with it.  So, I returned the Canon and purchased this Samsung (mostly because I still wanted the nice touch screen but thought it would have better, not excellent, but good, picture quality).  I have been relatively disappointed in the picture quality on this camera.  Even in great light conditions, the picture quality isn't all that great.  I took my new Samsung TL225 and my old Canon S410 out to the Zoo today to do some comparison shots.  It's really sad that my 7 year old, 4 MegaPixel camera is taking far better quality pictures than this brand new, 12.2 MegaPixel camera.  Somewhere along the line, the CCD manufacturers must have given up quality in the race to say they had the highest MegaPixel count in their device.  There is no excuse for the 4MP to look better than 12.2.  Before someone comes along and tells me that I just need to tweak this or that setting, I will say, both cameras were set to auto mode in the comparisons so that things were fair.  Also, I don't want to mess with settings, I want to point and shoot and get a decent (not professional) picture.  Most of these pictures look OK when zoomed all the way out, but don't think you are going to be able to zoom in and crop a little just because you have 12MP to work with.  Any zooming in on the picture on your computer reveals how washed out the image is.Pros:Very nice user interface.  Small/Slim.  Feels sturdy.  Cool front LCD feature.  Very responsive / powers on and takes pictures very quicklyCons: Picture quality is not very good at all for a 12.2MP point and shoot in this price range. (compared to the Canon S410)  Even with the flash on, this camera is terrible in low light conditions (also compared to the Canon S410)  Front LCD is difficult to turn on. (no big deal)  Bad battery life as expected (but they could have given us an 1100 mAh battery instead of the 750mAh to make up for this)  Computer (Win7) recognizes this camera as a storage device, not as a camera.  This is generally not a problem because windows  will import pictures using its own software, but I prefer Windows Live Photo Gallery and it will not import from the  \"AutoPlay\" menu because it doesn't know it's a camera.Overall, I'm not too upset about the picture quality because of the other good features, but when I would still suggest looking for something with better picture quality if you don't already own this camera.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "its a touch screen world out there now", "Author": "R. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1731J9BLN7787", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 1st touch camera. I have owned many small point and shot cameras and this one is the easiest one to work for me and takes great pictures.I bought this camera 1 month ago and went on vacation to wine country Napa/SonomaI downloaded the disc manual that comes with the camera and read it complete on the plane. I am glade I did. Being a touch screen you have no controls to turn like basic cameras.for anyone looking to buy this samsung, read the manual the funtions are mostly symbols and once you know all the touch funtions you will be taking great pictures.If you have a touch phone your halfway there. Amazining pictures and it gives you so many was to take your shots. The quality is great and the 3.5 in screen is outstanding just slide your finger on the screen and veiw or delete. As for the  the front view screen in works good but on sunny days you may have to angle it a bit could be brighter.rear screen is fine.some reviewers complain about fingerprints on the screen.. no problem with me, you just wipe them off, you do want to keep it clean.The camera is thin to store anywhere. I went to a my verizon phone store and bought a phone case  leather and has a clip for your belt. It work great when I was wine touring.Bottom line go and play with one but remember read the manual this camera has funtions that are not listed on the box..enjoy", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Puzzled doesn't quite describe how I feel about Samsung....", "Author": "Red", "ReviewID": "R1O74FD33VL7AM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a Canon person and just about all of my compact cameras have been Canon or Nikon. (I must have owned a dozen in the past decade). I got tired of my newest Canon and wanted to try something different. I've been very satisfied with Canon and it's consistent quality, but the fact remains that other than cosmetic changes and the continued increase in resolution (megapixels), very little is left to be desired by gadget lovers out there.I've been waiting for the price to drop on the Samsung dual views for a while. I purchased the TL-210 at Costco for about $200. When I brought it home, I realized that it wasn't quite the way I remembered it when I saw it for the first time a while back. It was a little bit bulky as well. I researched it and realized there are actually around 4 different models of the dual views. The TL-205? and TL-210 are the lower end models and neither are touch screen. The TL-220 and TL-225 are the higher end touch screen models. I went ahead and purchased the TL-225 ($260)through Amazon so that I can compare the TL-210 vs. the TL-225.The reason why I love Samsung is because they have a lot of imagination and are probably the most innovative. If only they could follow through with ingenuity and intuition!! My \"upgrade\" to the TL-225 touch screen actually downgraded some of my features. The TL-210 was 12.4mp and had a 5X optical zoom. The TL-225 is 12.2 mp and a 4.6X optical zoom. The 210 was not a touch screen so it had buttons all over. These buttons were all located in logical places and if you are familiar with the layout of Canon camera buttons, you wouldn't even need to read the Samsung manual to operate the camera. There was also a dedicated button on the top next to the on/off button to turn on the front lcd screen on the 210. You tap it once to go into self portrait mode, twice for couples, and three times for children (and a cartoon/animation automatically plays on the front screen to keep your child's attention). Simple right?I can't say the same for the TL-225. The touch screen means you have to deal with icons and none of the pictures on the icons give you a good idea of what the icon represents. There is no dedicated buttons other than the on/off button, zoom, and review. Since you are relying so much on touch screen menus, one would hope to at least see an easy to use, -organized-, logical menu. Wrong. It is so complicated that I will do my best to describe it here - (or you should go into a store and see for yourself!) - Imagine a 3\" screen with a bunch of icons lined down the left side. Along the bottom of the screen is an arrow with a \"pull up\" menu which pulls up more icons. Once you \"pull up\" these icons, you scroll through these icons left and right to find yet more settings that probably should have been included in the icons already on the left hand side of the screen. But wait! There's another arrow on the right side of the screen that pulls up MORE icons. These icons are redundant and are supposedly a quick way to select between the movie, smart, and picture modes...all of which can also be selected from the LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN!To make matters worse, these menus change with every mode you are in. So if you change from Auto to \"Smart Auto\" (I still can't figure out the difference btwn the two!) the icons will change as well. There is definitely a learning curve with the user interface regardless of how tech savvy you are. In addition to the \"downgrades\" you will also be losing some cool special effects such as vignetting and miniature that the lower model TL-210 has. The TL-225 comes with absolutely nothing! No case and no micro-SD which the Costco TL-210 had. What was Samsung thinking with the micro-SD anyway? In addition, the 210 actually has an HDMI output where as the more expensive 225 does not..(or maybe I just haven't found it yet!).But wait! There's more nonsense to gripe about! Both the 210 and 225 come with AC adaptors that are about a foot and a half long. These cords plug -directly- into the camera unlike others where you physically remove the battery to charge. So while the battery is charging in the camera, your camera is out of commission! In addition, with a foot long cord your camera winds up on the floor because it's not long enough to reach a table. One last gripe about the 225 (and 210), both are pretty big and bulky althought the 225 is a few millimeters skinnier than the 210 and neither have speakers that are very loud. Neither come with actual instruction manuals, it's on the CD-Rom, or you can view it on their website. Either way you need a pc.If you can deal with all of the above as I have begrudgingly tried to do...then I would really suggest you consider which model you would like to own. The 2 lower models look almost the same and other than a few small differences in features is basically the same camera. The 2 higher models (the TL220 and 225) are both touch screen and again, are basically the same camera. (Again Samsung redundancy and logic). Currently there is about a $30 difference btwn the 220 and 225. You get a huge gorgeous screen on the 225 and the 220 has sort of a pathetic looking one. For a $30 difference, one must question why Samsung produced two separate models that  didn't offer much of a benefit both price and feature wise.Pros: The TL225, once you learn to use it, is a decent camera. I do not think the picture quality (color saturation, contrast, etc.) is bad at all as long as you are holding the camera extremely still. Even with the so called stability sensors on, pictures do blur quite often especially in low light. I love the screen on the front and find it very handy. The large screen really is gorgeous and the camera seems well made with a metal back (although the screen does scratch easily and I had to put a protective sheet over it). The ability to \"flick\" the screen to scroll through your pictures is pretty neat, and you can also tilt the camera to advance the pictures as well. The special effects work really well such as \"cool, retro, classic, etc.\" but really could have benefitted more if it had features like Canon's color swap and color accent.I really wanted to give it 4+ stars but there's just too much to gripe about. This is not a replacement for a Canon and is more of a novelty. The front lcd screen doesn't make up for everything else that this is lacking and will likely satisfy neither amateur nor advanced users alike. Is that extra screen worth the $300 price tag? Not with all the sacrifices made.UPDATE: After playing with the camera a few more days, I have found that low light/no flash pictures continue to blur really bad even with the slightest movement. Unfortunately will have to return the camera since the picture quality is not consistent and trying to get a good picture (especially of my pets indoors!) requires too many tries. Can't imagine the frustration I might experience if I were on vacation.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does Everything Great but Take Pictures . . .", "Author": "Nicholas P. Mcgrew", "ReviewID": "R3F6OJHTVC7JN3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm just short of being flat out disappointed in the Samsung TL-225.I bought this before a trip we took.  Read and read and read about it.  I'll admit, I bought it for the cool features (touch screen, front LCD, etc.) but was really let down by picture quality.  All of my pictures from our trip are overexposed or out of focus.  Oddly enough, the best pictures are indoor pictures in medium - low lighting.The good . . . the touchscreen is the best touch screen I've ever used.  This may change when I pick up my HTC Incredible, but I digress . . . It is big, beautiful and very little lag.  The screen is responsive and the UI is very well thought out and easily navigated.  The front LCD was the selling point for me and it's really as good as advertised.  I don't use the cartoon clown, but enjoy it for self-portraits of us, and especially for the count down digits on timed shoots.  There are a lot of neat effects for pictures and a good portion of manual settings.  These manual settings may make this thing somewhat usable.  The video feature is actually pretty good.  It suffers a little from the poor lens but I was pleasantly surprised by the video!  I personally appreciated the MicroSD slot in the camera.  Why anyone would resist this is beyond me.  All devices these days use MicroSD.  You can but a card reader with the Micro slot for less than 10 bucks online.  Step into the 21st century, my friends!I took of my pictures on the Auto setting, as that had the best results when I was testing it.  But like I said, on the computer after our trip, they were washed out if there was any amount of sunlight in the background.  (they all looked good on the camera LCD)  I experimented later with Smart Auto with marginally better results.  This does increase the time required to process but makes the pictures slightly better.  The battery life is abysmal.  I was prepared for this and bought an aftermarket battery w/ external charger.  HIGHLY recommended.  It had a little higher ampacity and seems to last 50% longer.  The OEM battery is also a little wonky with the battery indicator.  Sometimes it'll show 1 bar right after a fresh charge.  But it'll be fine later.  I know batteries can be a little temperamental on occasion but this was too consistent for that . . .I came from a 5 year old, 5MP Canon and it wins the PQ argument.  I knew better than to leave Canon, but I wanted a small, sleek camera, and this seemed better (at the time) than what Canon had to offer.  I'm not expecting DSLR quality, but was hoping for significantly better.  But I missed the 30 day return window and hopefully can tinker around enough to make it usable.Given the chance again I would skip this camera.  :(", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "lemon", "Author": "pj", "ReviewID": "R10L0QV1G9X8PP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I selected the TL225 as I take a lot of self portraits with my young daughter.

Taking pictures is fun if you're using the camera in appropriate situations (it is a compact camera).  Prints look spectacular even when printed out in larger formats such as 11x17 and 13x19.  It's easy to delete and alter pictures and show off pictures to others.  The camera is very small and lightweight.Negative Aspects:Controls for front screen are not easily accessed.  Use of icons makes camera somewhat confusing and frustrating.  Do not expect to pick up the camera and understand where things are at in the menu structure or what icons mean. This does not mean that the camera is unintuitive, it is a problem inherent in using so many icons in so many menus.  It will take some time to adjust and to learn how to use the camera.  Camera can be a little slow in certain modes.PRO or CON?Requires MicroSD/SDHC card.  (They are relatively cheap but some people might be annoyed)Charging cable is proprietary but Samsung also cleverly made the cable act as both a usb connector and AC adaptor.  You can additionally charge the camera while attached to the computer via USB.Unit is so small/compact that some may find it difficult to grip.  Recommend that you use the included lanyard.Overall I am quite pleased with this camera.  It's very easy to take with you and get great shots. It's easy to pocket or you can get a small case (which I did) to protect it. The 3.5\" screen is absolutely gorgeous and can make a great display to show off shots you've taken.  I believe the more that I use the camera the more I enjoy it, initially it was frustrating even after printing out part of the manual.

I miss the ability to see a preview of what selecting a particular icon will bring, but I'm quickly learning to use all of the camera's extensive functions without such previews. A word on the lens. It is sharp and sports a serious wide angle capability that I very much appreciate in tight spaces where it's impossible to move back to include an entire group or surrounding environment. You've got to be careful not to get too close or subjects take on an almost humorous barrel-like appearance, but all-in-all, I love the wide lens. As for printing photos, I am able to print excellent images using Windows Vista's JPG viewer and Photoshop CS4. For quick prints, I use a network connected Epson Artisan 810 with Epson's best glossy photo paper, \"Ultra Premium Photo Paper - Glossy\". I use my Epson 3880 printer and a range of papers for more professional output. to fully manual controls. I also have two advanced, almost pro-level point-and-shoot cameras: a Sigma DP2 and a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3. All of the above cameras have a place in my work. The TL225 is a higher end point-and-shoot camera intended for amateur photographers. It shouldn't be compared to anything but other similarly featured and similarly priced point-and-shoots. I use it to capture images in fast moving environments - kids, family, parties, busy streets. It works wonderfully for those kinds of shots. The Smart Auto function is my favorite setting and that's a lot for someone who uses DSLRs mostly in manual and aperture priority mode to say. It took me a while to become comfortable turning over exposure and focus decisions to a camera, but, with the TL225, I get wonderful images almost all the time when I do.I just finished an assignment taking pictures of a very active one year old. I used my Nikon D300 and the TL225. Sure I got some great stuff with the D300, but, frankly, I got grab shots of the child with the TL225 that would have been impossible given the D300s size and bulk. And the shots were in sharp focus, with great colors and composition was consistently very good.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I so wanted to like it.", "Author": "Tammy in Atlanta", "ReviewID": "R3CQOWP1ID36VL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved the idea of the LCD on the front since my husband and I travel frequently-- but after a month of using it I realized there were several things that really bugged me about this camera.1) on one hand the touch screen is so awesome...until we tried to actually use the front LCD screen and take our photo together-- then it always seems no matter where you touch it... you touch something by accident that in turn makes it so that you can't take it and have to try again and again to carefully turn the camera around without touching ANYTHING!2) the photos are not the quality I was used to with my Lumix and they are smaller in size...I didn't think this would matter but when you do a lot of photo books online, it does because you can't get the same digital quality in the books.3) it began clicking with some strange noise -- don't know what it was and it didn't seem to affect whether or not it worked...but I returned it anyway.So, with these things in mind, I cannot recommend this camera...", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely Fun & Easy to Use", "Author": "S.

This camera is very compact - small and skinny but still comfortable to hold in the hand.  The camera takes beautiful pictures, but is probably not top of the line (it is a point-and-shoot, after all).  I would be hard pressed to pay the MSRP of $349 for this camera - it's not worth it.  I did grab this camera for $225 and it was a steal.PROS--The touch screen is remarkably responsive.  I like touch screens but have had rather poor experiences with them until now.  Touch, gestures, and tilt are easy to use without a lot of technical headache.--This camera is ultra-portable.  It weighs very little and fits snuggly into an extra-small case.--The front screen is great for taking self-portraits.  I never got the hang of positioning myself behind a backwards camera like the rest of my generation; this feature changes everything.  The screen is also invisible when not turned on.--The main screen is huge.  Pictures and menus have plenty of room for show, and the screen is of beautiful quality.--The camera takes pictures that are certainly high enough quality for the average photo album or scrapbook, but this is no professional camera.CONS--Almost nothing comes in the box.  The camera, AC adapter, USB cord, wrist strap, and battery are the contents.  I strongly recommend getting a camera case and extra battery, plus a memory card is a must.--This camera uses MICRO SD cards.  There's nothing inherently wrong with this, except that they are more expensive and very easy to lose.  I bought microSD cards with regular card-sized adapters.

Bank \"vbank\"", "ReviewID": "RV7H3EXJ5F44F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update to my Update.....****>>>People posting reviews and commenting on my review seem to be freaking obsessed with this camera and complete morons. I have to think they either work for Samsung or just plain have nothing better to do with their lives. I tend to think the later. I posted this review just to help anyone thinking about buying the camera. Its pretty expensive and I thought it might be gimmiky and IT IS. Its pretty much for the teen crowd that loves to take self portraits and post to facetube or whatever. If you dont agree with my review, then buy the camera and try it for yourself, and kick yourself later.Now since my last update I have printed a few pics and tried to adjust image quality using my own software. Samsung does NOT provide any software for this camera. I stand by my review. Some pics looked washed and a bit grainy. Even at the higest resolution, they are still a tad washed out. I am not comparing this to a DSLR, BTW. Also the Micro SD card is just matter of preference. Every other devise I have is SD, so I had to purchase another card. Just something to note and is a bit of a negative when the industry using standard SD cards. The last I checked, the price is coming down and will continue too. In fact if any of you obsessed freaks want to buy this camera, contact me. LOL....UPDATE........So I thought I would edit my comments as the other reviewer is either a \"plant\" for Samsung or just a complete freak. It sounds like she is really obsessed with this camera and might need a real life.So anyways, I just returned from a 10 day vaca from Europe. My girlfriend used this camera and I used my Nikon D90. I have to standby my review and rating. The picture quality, which BTW should be the number one selling point is just not up to cameras at this price range. Pics look a bit washed and grainy. Low Light pics are not good. When trying to use a no flash option in the Louvre, pics appeared muddy. We took a few videos and they look okbut nothing up to video camera or even DSLR quality.Battery life is average at best. But with that touch screen and playback, is can not be helped.I also stand my the micro SD card comments. Even with an adapter, its a pain in the but. Maybe its just me, but all of my devices, Nikon, PMP, PS3, my TV, all have SD inputs and uses. I am kinda old school, but I like just having one card that does it all. On our trip I had to have regular SD cards for me and 2 little micro SD cards for the Samsung. Again is just about convience here so its something to note.No EXTERNAL BATTERY!!! That was a killer. Every day, my girlfriend had to conserve juice by the end of day as it was drained. Granted we were using the camera a lot, but this would have so much easier to just pop in a new battery. Again my Nikon did not have this problem.The feature set on this camera is excellent however. In camera picture editing is very fun and there is a ton of options. The front facing LCD makes for great self portraits.So again at this price range, its not a good buy. I see that in the past few weeks the price is already down to 285, so my guess it will be down to the 200 mark in a few months. I would recommend waiting as the only reason I acutally bought this was that I had a gift card. If I could return this, I would....I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago for use for an upcoming trip to use along side my Nikon D90. The feature set and touch screen interface drew me to this camera, although upon using this camera, its not quite worth the cash.First I will start with the good.1) Touch Screen is excellent. Responsive and the screen is clear and resolution is excellent. The screen size is almost identical to an iphone. All camera makers should strive for this type of screen. Its crystal clear, and has haptic feedback when pressed. Battery life, see below.2) Front Facing Touch Screen. For Self Portraits and has a little clown for kids to stare at. This is acutally a great feature, although I think its not a feature most users will use.3) HD Movie Recording at 720p. Quality, see below...4) HMDI uplink to TV..Next the OK...1) Picture Quality. You really need to adjust the settings. Some pictures taken with no flash with manual settings look good. The Auto setting is a hit or miss along with the preset scenery settings. Some pictures look grainy or washed out. I really need to play with the settings to comment more about this, but so far not that impressed.2) Battery life is ok so far, but dont expect much with the touch screen.3) HD Movie recording appears a bit grainy as well. Again this is NOT a video camera, so my expectations are a bit low here.4) Decent Zoom and wide angle lensNow the Bad....1) Micro SD. Maybe they thought they could shave off some millimeters here off the size, but this is bad. Max support is at 8 gigs, so expect to purchase a few. I also imagine them getting lost pretty easy. Why not standard SD????2) Front Facing screen is not that responsive. Had to hit this a few times. I think a firmware update could fix this, but its works at random.3) No Case. At $349.99, a case should be included.4) No external battery charger. In camera charging limits you in carry and charging extra batteries.5) Software sucks or lack there of.And last but not least, the price. At this price point this should be taking near quality SLR images. The pictures just dont live up to price. I would guess the quality is more inline with a $100-$150 camera. The bells and whistles of the touch screen and happy clown face impress my girlfriend (who is using the camera) but I cant recommend this at this price point. Drop this to 199 and you have a winner....", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Small and Quick", "Author": "S.

The main problem is that each camera has displayed \"stuck\" pixels in every picture taken. The location and color of these pixels varies, but I've owned four models and they've all displayed this problem. The pixels are usually red or green, and typically appear around the center of the picture. This is not a problem with the camera display, but the actual CCD itself. Almost every picture we took of our daughter, born in February, has a green dot in the middle. Once you see it, it's very distracting. And every replacement Samsung has sent us (they replaced the CCD three times and replaced the entire camera twice) has had a stuck pixel somewhere in the picture. I can only assume this is a manufacturing tolerance that Samsung assumed no one would notice.Those problems and other minor issues aside (the camera infrequently locked up and/or stopped responding to input commands), I'd rate the camera at two stars based on MSRP and three starts if you bought it for under $150. It's a pretty standard point-and-shoot model and has a lot of fluffy but not terribly useful features. There's a setting to acutomatically take a picture when the camera detects a smiling face (if you're caucasian, anyway). The front-side LCD is mostly a novelty, although it did work to catch my daughter's attention a few times. There are a slew of image stabilization features, but I found that if I took a picture without blur, it usually contained red-eye effects and ridiculously unrealistic colors. The flash has several settings and none of them seem adequate.Overall, I'd call this a \"party\" camera. It's good for taking pictures in conditions where you're not going to get a very good picture anyway, it's easy to fit in your pocket, and if you drop it in a pitcher of beer, you probably won't be too distraught.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera.", "Author": "Lewis Eric Weil, Jr. \"Persop\"", "ReviewID": "R6Z0V78NUC062", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sent it to China and the end user has found it to be easy to use, fun and excellent pictures by a novice.

Also love that you can directly edit the images & videos on the camera. The MP4 format of the videos took some getting used to b/c I'm used to working on Windows Movie Maker and the MP4 format is not compatible w/WMM. There is however an editing & publishing program that this camera comes with -- just takes some getting used to is all. I bought this camera in a bundle package that is sadly no longer available on Amazon. The memory card included in the package was a class 2 so it is rather slow in processing sometimes. Not such a big deal if you're just taking pictures & videos but if you do any editing directly on the camera, it may take some processing time.Minor complaints:Videos taken indoors during night time really require an abundance of lighting, otherwise video quality comes out a bit grainy.

Here are some thoughts on it:The screen is superb.  Extremely clear, and the touch response is very nice.  Navigating through buttons and menus on the screen is lightning fast.  There are a few auto modes, as well as a scene mode with many scenes to choose from.  In program mode, you are given more options, but not really any manual controls except custom white balance.  Using finger gestures is wonderful, again, the screen is responsive and the effect is quick.  The body is very thin and can easily be carried in a pocket.The HD video is great, but quality is not really excellent, which is what you should expect from a compact camera.  You can take HD video and then downsize it to DVD size, and the quality looks quite good.  Picture quality is pretty decent, again, you want to be careful when looking at 100% zoom.  For a real test, rescale the photo to a reasonable size, or make a print.The 'tip' control feature is pretty handy - touch a button and tip the camera forward, backward, or to the left to quickly go to a certain mode, or in playback mode, to perform an action on the current picture.  The downside to this is you cannot customize what action is performed - it is preset.  Tipping can also be used to quickly scroll through photos in playback mode.So, overall, I highly recommend this camera primarily because it is fun to use!  It takes generally good pictures, and nice video, but the biggest plus is usability.

So, I'm used to fast cameras with semi- to fully manual controls. I also have two advanced, almost pro-level point-and-shoot cameras: a Sigma DP2 and a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3. All of the above cameras have a place in my work.The TL225 is a higher end point-and-shoot camera intended for amateur photographers. It shouldn't be compared to anything but other similarly featured and similarly priced point-and-shoots. I use it to capture images in fast moving environments - kids, family, parties, busy streets. It works wonderfully for those kinds of shots. The Smart Auto function is my favorite setting and that's a lot for someone who uses DSLRs mostly in manual and aperture priority mode to say. It took me a while to become comfortable turning over exposure and focus decisions to a camera, but, with the TL225, I get wonderful images almost all the time when I do.I just finished an assignment taking pictures of a very active one year old. I used my Nikon D300 and the TL225. Sure I got some great stuff with the D300, but, frankly, I got grab shots of the child with the TL225 that would have been impossible given the D300s size and bulk. And the shots were in sharp focus, with great colors and composition was consistently very good.I have had no problem adapting to the touch screen. I use an iPhone and HP TouchSmart notebook computer, so I'm pretty comfortable with touch. I miss the ability to see a preview of what selecting a particular icon will bring, but I'm quickly learning to use all of the camera's extensive functions without such previews.A word on the lens. It is sharp and sports a serious wide angle capability that I very much appreciate in tight spaces where it's impossible to move back to include an entire group or surrounding environment. You've got to be careful not to get too close or subjects take on an almost humorous barrel-like appearance, but all-in-all, I love the wide lens.As for printing photos, I am able to print excellent images using Windows Vista's JPG viewer and Photoshop CS4. For quick prints, I use a network connected Epson Artisan 810 with Epson's best glossy photo paper, \"Ultra Premium Photo Paper - Glossy\". I use my Epson 3880 printer and a range of papers for more professional output.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!!!!

Included with this review is everything you will ever need to know about this camera, explained in extreme detail, very well written! Simply copy and paste, Enjoy....[...]BTW, the reviewer below (V.Bank) should have done his worked with this camera a tad bit more, I find his review shabby at best, and does this camera little to no justice with the little time he has spent with it. The review I posted above debunks half the things V.Bank stated in his review! You are not going to find a camera with all the features this one offers for [...] bucks, it's just not gonna happen!  Also, saying that it will be easy to loose the Micro-SD card is ridiculous considering most all Micr-SD cards are now sold with the adapter included. The adapter is actually an actual size SD card that the Micro SD card slides into.  When taking my Micro-SD card out I immediately place it in the adapter, place it in its case and into my camera bag. I don't see it being any harder to loose then a regular SD card, considering that's exactly what the adapter is, an SD card! As long as you are responsible you should have no problems.I am still working with this Cam daily and am finding new modes and features on it everytime I use it, it's a blast, I am in LOVE! :)....................................................  I have still yet to figure out why people like Daniel (Below my review) post reviews before even handling the camera?!!! How can someone have the nerve to post a \"Star\" review on something they have yet to operate, let alone turn on? What he did was like me giving a taste-test review on a food product without ever tasting it!N-E-Ways  I (Finally) received the Camera this morning (Sat) and it has more then exceeded my expectations!  I am having even more fun with the TL225 then I was with the TL220! The screen is larger, the higher resolution shows big-time, and the video's I have shot just look awesome on my 46\" HDTV!  Samsung with the new Micro card is looking ahead IMO. This translates to more flexibility in using your new microSD card for not just only the camera, but also your other mobile devices. I LOVE this Idea as now I can swap the Micro SD from my camera to phone and have one memory card that does it all without the need of buying separate storage devices. I am very very pleased with this!  I second this quote I've seen in a review on a UK site...\"Nonetheless, the other oddity (albeit a good one) is the use of microSD cards instead of the usual SD card format. Think of the use you can get out of the microSD card across all your other mobile devices, and you'll get our point.\"  The pictures are crystal clear when posted on my HDTV, detailed with little to no noticeable noise at low ISO. Pictures anywhere above ISO 400 (400 is fine) begin to show noticeable noise, but that is to be expected with any and every P&S; on the market with a 1/2.33 sensor size (with exception of Sony's new Exmor R sensor they are incorporating in there new line of cameras, this new sensor uses a back-light within camera to reduce noise at high ISO by feeding light to the sensor for great night shots without the use of stabilizing support).  Night shots are WONDERFUL with the TL225 considering the camera is well stabilized on a platform or mini tripod, absolutely breathtaking images!  With this said I will be updating this review within the week to give a full blow-out review! Until then, you can read a quick review I posted about 4 days ago on a couple other sites regarding my time spent with the TL220 at Best Buy (BTW, the TL225 does have the 14 modes of screen select the TL220 has, not the 16 as Samsung led me to believe from there UK site, don't understand why the did this. I am a tad disappointed the TL225 does not have \"Action\" shooting mode, but no biggy, there are ways around it)...\"I went to Best Buy yesterday and played around with the TL220 (st500 and st550 in Europe and Asia, and is the same cam as the TL225, just less features) for over an hour (no kidding, an employee told me to \"Just buy the thing already\"lol), and I can not express how much I LOVE this thing!I have never had so much fun playing around with a camera before! It is sooo user friendly, I picked it up and knew everything within a couple of minutes!The Pictures it took where pretty good, it didn't do so well with close moving subjects, much blurr, but still pics where clear and the colors where vibrant. I found a Korean site to where a gentleman who bought this Cam posted a TON of Pic's, they all looked wonderful as-well. He also stated that this was a \"Very Very good Cam\".My favorite feature that sent me over the top was the \"Beauty Shot\" mode and front LCD feature! I have scars on my face due to acne (pretty bad scaring), and I went into Best Buy looking greasy and very sweaty (just got off of work). The pictures I took of myself in Beauty Shot mode made me look like a Model!!! I am not kidding, my face went from greasy and nasty in regular pics I was taking of myself, to looking like I belonged on a runway for a photo-shoot once in Beauty Mode!!! I was SHOCKED at how perfectly complected my face looked, you could not see one acne scar or blemish, it was amazing! I did not expect this feature to work so well!!!I took probably 80 or so pic's of myself, I absolutely love the front screen! Yes, I took pics of myself before, but only for web-sites a forum purposes. With this, it was a BLAST!!! I had so much fun with this camera, I did not expect myself to care to much for the front screen, but I will be using it all the time once I pick-up this cam!!All I was looking for was a decent point and shoot that had great HD video and good quality Pic's for vacationing, and playing with this cam for as long as I did sent me over the edge with all the features it has, I REALLY LOVE IT! I would like to note that my fiance owns the Nikon D90 and I use it often, so I have some decent knowledge on how pictures should look. I also own my share of P&S; cams.The girl at Best Buy told me they Sold Out right away and have the cam on back-order, and that she hears nothing but good things about it (she is actually going to school for photography and said she thinks the cam is a really good buy, and she was not saying this because she works there, I have known her for atleast a year already (from Best Buy) so we are more friends then me being just a customer to her.I also tested the HD video and it was WONDERFUL! Someone posted 3 test vids on YouTube using the tl220, the new compression format makes it look like HD even when choosing not to watch in HD! Never seen such great quality Vid before in a camera!!! It is also REALLY REALLY cool how you can Pause when recording, and then resume play when you decide to, this way all recordings are on the same file. You can also edit the vid in camera by trimming the vid, meaning takeout parts you don't want and keep what you do want.I will be getting the TL225 instead of the TL220. It has a bigger screen, metal back instead of the Tl220's plastic back, HDMI inputs (for viewing your Pics and Vid on an HD TV) that the TL220 does not have. The TL225 also wieghs a half-ounce more then the TL220 due to the choice of displays. One more thing to note is that the TL220 3.0-inch LCD screen resolution has 230,000 dots, while the TL225 has much much higher resolution at 1,152,000 dots on it's 3.5-inch LCD, the highest ever resolution on a Point and Shoot Camera (for you newbies the higher the resolution the clearer the screen will be and you will be able to see more detail on whatever it is you are taking a picture of). To me, the extra $50 for the TL225 is well worth it if you can afford it.Note that both Cams (TL220 and TL225) look identical other then the back screen being bigger on the TL225, and the colors they come in. I do wish the TL225 came in Red and Blue, but the orange will have to do for me. I will also be posting this same review for the TL220 for people looking to get that since that's the actual Cam that I toyed with.I have done sooo much research on these cams in the past 2 weeks it is ridiculous!!lol I will give a more extensive review once I have this puppy to play with for longer then just a couple of hours.All I have to say is I LOVE THIS CAM and can't wait to get it, it def exceeded my expectations thus far! :)\"", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera didn't work", "Author": "D.

We went to a demo camera area to get an external power. Then I saw the demo camera in the OFF mode. Sure enough, I could not power it on neither.The sale tech told me to get the Tl220 version instead. He mentioned that this TL225 with bigger screen has lot of failures.My wife loves the large screen of the tl225, but has no choice but to get the tl220 due to quality issues. It work like a charm, first time power on.So if you buy this camera, then it may be good to also buy the exchange warranty with it as well.PS: The smaller screen 3\" on the TL220 does not look as beatiful as the larger 3.5\" screen on the TL225.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Every picture blurred!", "Author": "MadisonVeggie \"Lynette in Wisconsin\"", "ReviewID": "R32ME9IL3J899U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, this purchase has been a huge disappointment. I purchased this September 30th, but then could not use it because it does not use standard memory cards and I had to go out of town on business. So, I get back and go to several stores - CVS, Walgreen's, etc and they do not carry the memory cards. Finally, I went to Radio Shack and they had them, but insisted that they were not used in any cameras and tried to talk me out of buying one. I bought the card anyway and finally had a chance to use it to take halloween pictures of my kids. Well,  guess what? EVERY picture is blurry, at EVERY setting and even on a tripod. So, now it has been (just) over 30 days and I can't return it. Called Samsung, and what they told me basically amounts to \"if it doesn't work we're going to try to trick you out of even more money.\" Bottom line, for all extents and purposes there is no warranty. So, if you are considering buying this: (1) be ready to get the special memory card ASAP and test it out thoroughly from day one, because, (2) if you miss your 30-day return window you just paid for a paperweight.

Last week I purchased a panasonic ZS3 and I am waiting to have it on my hands.This is not exactly a review, so I apologize about that, but after reading a bit about this camera, it seems that it's just \"ok\" and has normal functions for it's price. the new tech it has, the dual screen is great, I can think of a couple situations where it might had come in handy compared to my sony cameras.I do suggest for anyone to try get information on this camera before buying it. I've been let down by newer sony's models as they don't take amazing pictures as I'd would like to (and as I was used with an old P200 from sony)I also suggest reading V.Bank's review. his review seems to be honest and makes me believe all he is saying is the truth. There is another review that doesn't seem to be a user review, but a fan, or almost as someone who works for samsung. Mary Shelton seems to know too much about the camera, even though \"she\" says she doesn't know much about them. the link she gives for the review, is called \"seagadget\". I did some review and this site belongs to samsung electronics America inc (SEA). So it's not a review, it's a product in-depth description. if you go to the site, take note that they only review samsung \"gadgets\"When I mentioned Mary as a \"she\", I said that because \"she\" seems to have other identities. She just copies and pastes her review, did it on the samsung TL220, but with another nickname (Giles Shelton \"EtherMagic\" (Chicago)) --- Why use another nickname and do the exact same review?. Then I wanted to search about the camera at dpreview, and found his exact same review, but signed as \"Paul\". there are a few days apart from each \"review\" but he or she always say \"I went to best buy yesterday\". someone defending so much a product that you don't actually have is not a good reviewer. I wouldn't dare to review my ZS3 even though I have also toyed and research a lot about it. I would even wait for a couple of weeks to make a good review.Anyway, I can compare a bit the samsung with the panasonic Zs3 which have the same msrp:megapixels: samsung has 12 vs pannys 10. If you are going to print out posters then samsung is a winneroptical zoom: panasonic wins all the way with 12X vs. 4.6X . That's more than doublewide angle: both are wide enough, BUT panasonic has 25mm vs samsung's 27mm. (smaller is better, gets more of the scene into your picture)The other specifications are similar, so I won't go into details. mini SD? who cares? I've owned sony with memory sticks and never had a problem to transfer them to a PC or to my laptop. Paul, Mary or Giles (whatever his name is) is right, it comes with an adapter so you will have a regular sized SD. Afraid to get it lost? Be extra carefulGo to best buy and try the samsung, try the panasonic, try whatever brand you like. At the end, the most important thing about a point and shoot is that you get excellent results from your shots, daylight, low light conditions, etc. All of the rest fails and is worthless if your pictures don't come clean.you can find REAL reviews of REAL people here at amazon and everywhere else, make sure to read them and discard what looks fake.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Initial thoughts", "Author": "Daniel R.
