{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Camera for the Investment", "Author": "BTideRoll", "ReviewID": "RXE67GZN3A19H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Folks, this purchase came after 3 solid days of research using everything from Amazon, CNet, Infosyncworld, to YouTube. You are here, reading reviews, as I was at the beginning of my search for a great quality digital camera that was neither high-end nor cheap. Let me begin by saying that I just purchased this camera and have not gone over extensive testing myself, but rest assured that you should NOT take Amazon.com reviews for digital cameras (and a lot of other things for that matter) as the gospel. Why? Because too many people come on here, bashing good equipment when the vast majority of the time it is user error. Please, do yourself a favor and do research using professional analysis by people that test these things out and that take pictures and video that you can see for YOURSELF.I ignored all of the reviews that didn't specifically point towards any sort of systematic malfunction and that solely complained about image quality or other things that are easily altered and messed up using settings. And also reviews that complained about their camera breaking -- yeah I don't care HOW far you think you dropped it from...dropping electronics and it breaking then giving it a negative review is absurd. After narrowing my search down to the Canon S95, the Canon SX230, the Nikon s8100 and the Nikon s9100, I chose the Nikon S9100.WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR:1. a compact camera...not too small, not too big2. advanced enough to get my feet wet in the world of digital photography3. offers 1080 HD video4. optical zoom of at LEAST 10X5. Under $450 - as I'm not ready to purchase a dSLR6. utmost picture quality offered by a point & shoot (to include low-light performance)WHAT MY RESEARCH TOLD ME:1. professional review websites, not amazon reviewers, know what they are talking about when it comes to digital camera picture/video quality and they back it up with samples2. not to rely on a handful of negative reviews to sway my decision3. Nikon and Canon were the 2 most reliable brands offering products that met my requirements4. cameras are going to offer stuff I don't need, won't use5. pretty much all of the cameras are battery hogs6. the memory card can influence camera performance/speed (wonder how many negative reviewers trashed the Nikon for their lack of putting a quality card in it eh)MY FINAL 2 CHOICES:1. Nikon s9100Why over the s8100?-well, the image quality is virtually identical DESPITE what some of the Amazon reviewers are saying because they pretty much use the same imaging system.-s9100 has slight upgrades to scene modes, video, etc...-s9100 is the newer model and has just dropped to a reasonable price as compared to the s81002. Canon sx230Why over the S95?-the s95 didn't shoot 1080 video (it is a 2010 model)-the s95 had a lot of manual controls I am not ready for at this point and that I'd probably not use (this is a PRO for a lot of people)-the s95 would likely be upgraded in the near future with a 2011 model-the s95 cost roughly $50 more and didn't really give me anything the sx230 wouldn't at my usage levelSo, How'd I decide on the Nikon S9100 over the Canon SX230:Menu System: Canon - I really liked the canon menu system and it was really fast to navigate. However, the Nikon menu was just as fast, just not as fancy or \"pretty\" as the Canon.Image Quality: Tie; I found pictures taken at the store to be the same, and reviews online touted both cameras as being excellent in both low-light and bright light.Video Quality: TiePicture/Video Stabilization: Picture: Tie; Video: CanonZoom: NikonEffects: Tie - however the Nikon approaches some of the effects a little bit different. Canon does offer a few effects the Nikon didn't like a miniature video effect.Audio: Tie - however you will hear the zoom in your videos if you use it while recording.Form Factor: Canon - the Canon was more sleek and curvyComfortability: Nikon - the Nikon just fit my hand betterPrice: Nikon - the Nikon was roughly $40 less.In the end I REALLY liked both cameras. I'm no pro photographer, but I didn't want a battery operated purse toy either. So I don't think I would have gone wrong either way, however I just couldn't justify spending $40 more for the Canon when it really didn't offer me anything more features (that I'd use) over the Nikon. I wouldn't use the GPS function on the Canon...it is a battery hog anyway, EVEN when the camera is off unless you turn the feature off. I wouldn't really use a few of the extra effects the Canon had, and the Nikon had the better zoom. Despite Nikon's menus not being as pretty, nor the back of the camera being as pretty. I liked it's LCD screen better and was able to understand the menus just fine. In the end it was the price point and the fact the Canon had features I didn't want that led me to purchasing the Nikon.So there it is folks (if you made it this far). Please do research and compare yourself before making a purchase based on consumer reviews. I would take a lot of these reviews with a grain of salt unless you see systematic issues EVERYONE is having with mechanical failures or hardware issues. Check out the resources I listed at the top of this article and you can't go wrong. But if you do, just be aware of the return policy and take comfort in knowing you can return.***********************************UPDATE 5/26/11***********************************Now that I've owned the camera for a little bit longer I thought I'd post another update to answer a few more questions folks might have or like to know about. I initially gave this 5 starts without owning it very long based on my initial experience with the camera and the feature set it had based on what I needed/wanted and the price point. My review is still excellent, but now I'd give it 4.5 stars due to the way it chargers and the necessity to purchase additional equip for the type of functionality I'm used to. I've been an exclusive Canon owner in the past, but this Nikon is a gem.1. Picture Quality: Crystal clear. I have no issues with blur. Make sure you take good care of the camera and keep the lens clean.2. Zoom: Incredible. Such a high zoom for the price point. Probably the best zoom you will find on a point & shoot.3. Battery: Battery life is as expected. You will need to purchase at least 1 more EN12 battery as backup.4. Charging: This camera charges with the battery inside. You charge the camera via USB into your computer or into a wall outlet. If you want to charge the battery separately you will need to purchase a separate wall mount battery charger (~$25-35 bucks). This is one reason I am lowering my review to 4.5 stars is because I feel the battery charger should have come with the camera. Charging is a big deal and we all like to be able to charge a battery AND still use the camera. You can't do that with this camera unless you buy a separate battery and the wall mount charger. That being said, it IS nice to be able to charge this camera via USB into your computer.5. Compatibility: I have a MAC and I have zero issues. You can use iPhoto, or Picasa (from Google) or whatever else and it works fine. Also, it uses the same batteries as the S8100 and a few other models so if you are upgrading you can use your same batteries.6. Flash: The flash works great. It has plenty of power and turns any photos in a completely dark area into a crisp colorful bright photo.7. Size: The size is just about right. For a point & shoot, this is just about as big as you get before entering the DSLR realm. It is not pocket friendly, but is purse/bag friendly. The reason this camera is a bit bigger is to accommodate the awesome zoom as well as the larger LCD screen and flash.8. LCD Screen: Perfect size LCD screen to view. Consider investing ~7-8 bucks into a plastic screen protector so it won't get scratched.9. Controls: As I previously reviewed, the back of the Nikon is not as sleek or ergonomic as the Canon model(s), but nevertheless the design works fine for my hands (medium sized male hands). I am able to cleanly press all buttons and functions with no problem and I don't feel them to be cheap or to be faulty in any way.10. Video: Great video, but stabilization will be an issue, especially at high zooms. But I knew this going in. Consider getting a tripod for serious video shooting, or prepare to film at a low zoom.11. Effects/Modes: I love the effects and modes in this camera. You can create a lot of artistic effects without needing to use Photoshop or other expensive programs. IE. black and white photos that specifically highlight/target a single color palette illuminating a single color in your shot resulting in dramatic and beautiful shots. (by far my fav effect).All-in-all, I'm very happy with my purchase. I just noticed the price dropped again making this camera even more of a great value. If you are looking for a small ultra portable purse camera for dinner and whatnot, look elsewhere. This one is inbetween the small point & shoots and the DSLRs. If you are looking for a high quality, yet compact enough to carry around and produce amazing shots, this is your camera. I'd say for the best review check out Infosyncworld's video review on their website or on YouTube for a closer look at it's size and capabilities.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "RW21A64ZZFZ1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I'm no professional photographer, but I am picky about how my pictures look. I have a good eye, and can be very anal about details in my photos. I've seen this camera get some bad reviews lately, and I am really perplexed by this. I looked at lots of other cameras. some costing more and some less. This was by far the best point and shoot pocket-able mega zoom out there, I thought. I read some negative reviews about sluggish focus and blurred images from here and from Best Buy's web site. I don't know if a bad batch of cameras went out? I did have some focus issues right out of the box when I started using the camera; but after inspecting the camera I noticed a nice big greasy finger print right on the lens. I'm pretty sure it wasn't from me, but I wouldn't bet my life on it though. After cleaning the lens, I have had no focus issues. The only thing I can say about the focus is that when indoors, sometimes you need to take a step back and use more zoom to get focus lock, and sometimes you might need to take a step forward and use less zoom to achieve focus lock. This happens rarely though. Most of the time my S9100 focuses fast and true. Low light shots are great indoors and out. Auto mode works pretty good for about 90% of my shots, and the rest I use the various setting or scene modes to capture the shot I want. Now I'm not saying every shot I take is perfect and clear. As with any camera digital or film. You have to expect a few bad shots. That's why I always try to take more that one shot when possible. the lcd is gorgeous. I find that if the pictures look good on the camera, they will look good on my computer. Of course different computers will yield different results. On my laptop the pictures look a bit drab or dull, but on my desk top with a high res monitor the pictures are real vivid and pleasing to the eye. I've had the camera now for almost two weeks and I love it. The long zoom is great, but even with image stabilizing enabled you will need a steady hand for clear shots at higher zoom levels. The video from the camera plays nice and smooth on my computer when I use windows media player; but when I tried quick time the video was choppy. In video mode you can take pics while recording, which is nice. There is no shutter sound when you take the picture, therefore no shutter sound in the video. You will however hear the zoom lens in your videos under quiet situations. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. The camera starts up quick with little delay from shot to shot. I do recommend a class 6 or higher memory card. It made a big difference for me in burst mode. The camera can fire off 5 shots at a rate of 9.5 fps, but write times with a class 4 were painfully slow. I had to wait a good 9 to 10 seconds before my next shot. I am now using a class 10 and that time has been cut down to about 3 to 4 seconds. A bit of advice on memory cards. Make sure you look at the minimum and maximum write times. Not all class tens or sixes are equal. I saw a lot of class 10 cards with the same write speeds as higher end class 6 cards. I did upload a bunch of pictures so everyone can judge for themselves on quality. I guess the best advice I can give is try some test shots using various scene modes for other than there intended purpose. That's what I try to do when possible. I'll take a few pictures of the same shot using different settings. Then I view them on the computer later to see what looks best.  Some other things I would like to touch on. A complaint I heard a lot about on the S8100 is the battery level wasn't displayed until the camera needed charging. It is now displayed always on the S9100. Another complaint was about flash placement on the S8100. It's in the same place for this one, but for me there is still enough room behind the flash for my finger. The flash no longer pops up automatically. It now pops up by activating a little switch on the side of the camera. This I actually like. I never cared for auto pop up flashes. Some people have complained about placement of the shutter button. That of course is an individual preference and shouldn't effect a rating. I like where it is on this camera, no problems at all. The other buttons and dials all seem to be good places and easy to activate or use. The camera itself is pretty easy to use. The interface is simple and clean. Settings are easy to get to and not buried under five or six sub menus. All in all, this is a great little camera.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Consider S8100 instead", "Author": "avgjoe", "ReviewID": "R476AV209BBM1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The specs for the S9100 looked promising but it produced fuzzy and often out of focus still pictures making it unacceptable.  In the end, I found the Nikon S8100 to have superior picture quality.I started by taking 50 or so pictures in a variety of setting using the S9100's default settings. The results looked ok on the camera's 3\" screen but once loaded to my PC, poor focusing & fuzzy/soft edges were evident in almost every photo. I wasn't ready to give up on the S9100 so I spent the next couple of days reading the manual and even buying my second choice (Nikon's S8100) for a direct comparison. I am upgrading from a Sony DSC-P200 (3x zoom, 7.2 MP) which produces good pictures but has a small field of view, only a 3X zoom and only does so so in low light. So my final comparison was between all 3 cameras.After reading the S9100's manual I adjusted some of the default settings in the hope it would improve the photo quality:* Auto Focus (AF) mode: I selected Center mode instead of the default. This tells the camera to focus on the center of the screen instead of the default. The default attempts to guess at what you want to focus on which in my experience was the closest object.* ISO Setting: I changed the default to limit the ISO range to 400 max (Suggested in some other/similar Nikon camera reviews).* Auto vs. Scene modes: For indoor photos I selected the indoor scene mode.Of the 3 changes to the default setting above, only the AF Center change seemed to impact my test photos. I was able to tell the camera what object I wanted to focus on but even then focus was hit or miss.With the S9100 settings tweaked I again took the same 50 or so photos I took earlier using the factory default setting and compared them to the same shots taken with the Nikon S8100 and Sony DSC-P200.  The results:Even when the S9100 appeared to focus on the proper object the photos were still fuzzy/soft when views on my pc. The more I zoomed in on the photos on my PC the more I could see the flaws. When I viewed the same photos taken on the Nikon S8100 and Sony DSC-P200 for the most part they were superior/crisper than the S9100 though the Sony could not zoom in nearly as close as the S9100 or S8100. The test photos were not particularly challenging... Indoors with lights on and Outdoors in midday daylight - With/without flash, wide/ zoomed, Auto/ indoor scene modes and focusing on various objects only some of which should challenge the AF. If the S9100 can't handle these basic shots there's no point testing more challenging tasks like low light, fast action or HD video.Conclusion: The S8100 has superior (But by no means prefect) picture quality in these basic everyday situations and has the zoom upgrade I was looking for, it's a keeper. The S9100's poor picture quality is a show stopper, it's going back.Considering the specs how could this be? I'm no expert but one possible cause is the image stabilization process... The S8100 uses Lens shift and S9100 uses Senor shift.  Of course perhaps I happened to get a defective camera.For those of you who are wonder what I mean by Fuzzy/Soft. A picture of a couch with patterns in the pillows... the edge of the pillow with a wall in behind it looked fuzzy and the pattern on the pillow looking as if the lines in the patterns were blended/feathered with the S9100 but sharper/crisper with the S8100. Pictures that involved text, whether it be a birthday card on a hutch or the lighting instructions on my grill, were clear and easily read in the s8100 photos but blurred/fuzzy to the point where I could only guess what the words were with the S9100.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "tiny marvel!", "Author": "Peter Alfeld \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R27AOP6NYGEDFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually use a cumbersome system consisting of a Nikon D300 andnumerous accessories. Naturally I don't carry this gear with me allthe time, and I wanted a small camera as a constant companion and as abackup.  I ordered the Nikon S9100 before it was reviewed. While I waswaiting to receive it the first reviews came out, and I admit Iwas worried by the negative comments describing the S9100's purportedpoor focusing ability.  Perhaps, as one reviewer remarked, there is abad batch out there, but I am pleased to say that my copy of the 9100has no trouble focusing.  In fact it does everything I wanted it to,and I'm very pleased with it.  You don't have the control you have with afull blown DSLR but this marvel of technology fits amazing abilities into avery small package.  In fact it has some abilities that my D300doesn't have, specifically the easy panorama facility, and the option totake videos (of up to half an hour in length).  The one feature thatsold me on this particular point and shoot is its incredible zoomrange.

I couldn't decide between the Nikon D3100, or the Canon Rebel. After getting a new job as a food photographer, I wanted to upgrade from my current camera, the Kodak Z981, to something with a few more options. I've ALWAYS used only Kodak cameras because of their user friendly operation and editing software. Unfortunately, after only 10 minutes with the SLR's, I realized it was WAAAAAY more camera than I was ever going to use...and I couldn't operate it if my life depended on it. I was getting ready to leave when I figured I'd check out what was new in the world of regular digital cameras. That's when I ran into this little guy.I talked with a very knowledgeable Best Buy associate who, after explaining exactly what I want and need in a camera, pointed me to this camera, and the Nikon Coolpix P500. After playing with both of them and finding them very similar (the only major difference being the P500 has a 35X zoom, which I don't need), I really liked the size of this camera. I never thought in a million years I would go this small when purchasing a new camera, but I absolutely love it.I've taken numerous photos with this camera (mainly of food, since that's what I do), and they are stunning (I've shared some above)! There's actually a 'Food' setting under scene mode, but I prefer the 'Close-up' setting...makes the colors seem a bit more vivid IMO. I've taken pictures of my son playing outside using both Auto Mode and Sports Mode, and they came out crisp and clear...no blurry hands and legs!This camera is super easy to use and you can jump right into taking pictures with ease. I only needed to consult the user manual about a couple things, like how to delete multiple photos at once. If you're a Nikon veteran though, you probably already know how to do this on one of their cameras. I didn't download the software that came with this, the ViewNX 2 program. When I plugged the camera into my computer I was able to send my photos to my Kodak EasyShare Program. I'm just not ready to part with my photo editing software yet, so I'll keep Kodak around for that purpose.Overall, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this camera. If I could change anything about it, it would two things. I would love to switch the Mode Dial and the Shutter Release Button around. I think the shutter button is just a bit too far in towards the middle of the camera. The ideal place for it would be on the far right edge of the top of the camera, where the mode dial currently is. Also, the little door on the bottom of the camera that opens to reveal the USB port is a little flimsy and annoying. It's a rubbery flap you have to pop open then spin around out of the way so you can plug the cord in. It's a cumbersome design since this port gets so much use...it's not only how you get pics onto your computer (unless you take your memory card out and do it that way), but it's also how you charge the battery. OH...and THAT is awesome! To charge your battery, just plug the camera into the wall or your computer...no buying new batteries or having to remove them from the camera to put them in a charger (my Kodak was like that...4 AA batteries that have to be removed and placed in a wall charger...VERY aggravating to have to remember to bring the charger with us on vacations. Even more aggravating when I forget).Well, I think that about covers it. This is a great little camera, but don't be fooled by it's small size. It has TONS of features, settings, editing options right on the camera itself (my favorite is Miniature Mode), and an 18X zoom! I'm a little sad to be ending my lifelong relationship with Kodak cameras but, judging by how great this Nikon has been in the few short weeks I've had it, I think I'll get over it.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Regretting purchase", "Author": "Dave S.", "ReviewID": "R2FA1K31VDN4E8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at my local Best Buy due to the outstanding feature set and optical zoom.  On paper, it's a great camera with great features.  Unfortunately, after only 80 pictures, I began experiencing the lock-up issues that others are seeing.  When I would turn it on, the lens extends most of the way but then you can hear it clicking inside as it apparently isn't getting fully extended but is still trying.  I took it back to Best Buy assuming I would get an exchange but they forced me to send it in for service through the geek squad, which took over 4 weeks.  After getting it back, the problem started happening again.  I took it back in and the customer service girl messed with it by twisting the base of the lens stack, which apparently got it back in the groove and now it works again....for now.  That had me leaving the store with it \"working\" again.  Had the service girl not messed with it, they were going to force me to send it in for another few weeks of service.  Now I have a fairly expensive camera that I have to treat like some old piece of junk that you have to fiddle with to get it to operate normally.Don't buy this camera.

I guess since everyone uses these today, it must be good for sony to have all these licenses for the multi-shot technology.The S9100 is about the same size as most mid-sized compacts with superzooms (10-18X) like the ZS3-7-10, HX5V, SX230IS, etc. Pocketable to be sure, but noticably larger than the smaller TX7, WX9, S95 variants out there.PROS: the Night Landscape is the multi-shot low light implementation of the Handheld Twilight of Sony. Works great and is impressive for non-moving subjects. HDR is multi-shot. The Burst modes are very flexible, either 5 full-res 4000x3000 shots max at 10fps, or up to 24 full-res shots at about 2 shots per second (nearly perfect for longer sports sequences).Manual flash switch - I like this - no flash until needed - bravo!Big instant video button - yea!Beautiful screen  - woohoo - stunning, slide shows awesome (although no music like the Sony's).Boots like in one second - wow.Fast menu changes - way faster than my Sony TX9 - I hate touch screens on a camera.Focuses quickly - I use the \"Center\" setting and so far, not too many OOF shots.BSS - this is my BFF - the Best Shot Selection rocks! Takes 5 shots and then chooses and saves the sharpest one.Panoramas extend to 360 degrees wide - cool!CONS: Amazing - NO AUTO PHOTO ROTATION - you must rotate each and every shot in your photo app (and the Nikon post-processing and download is a joke - just get Picasa instead). LAME LAME LAME - SHAME SHAME SHAME on Nikon for not being able to do what $100 cams have been able to do for a few years now. Yeah, I know - no big deal but the next time you have to sift thru hundreds of shots rotating what should have been automatic, you'll realize.No good spot focus! Every other camera I've owned has a better spot focus than this. I use the \"Center\" expose and focus. LAME but works.No sharpness control - vivid and hue - yes, but sharpness - NO.No external battery charger - you are hosed, period. Yeah, you won't forget the external charger, but guess what? You still have to remember to bring the internal charger - d'oh. Third party chargers are $5 but grrrrrr for having to buy one!No easy access to the panorama mode - have to dig into scene mode, which is lame.No multi-shot anti-motion mode.

After trying them all in stores, reading the spec sheets and reading reviews I settled on the S9100.  My wife and I currently own a Canon SD750 and have been extremely happy with it, we also own a Nikon D40x with it's own kit, so we're not exactly newbies to the photography world.After unpacking, the first surprise (and bit of a disappointment) was the tethered charger.  The next surprise was that the charging socket on the camera is on the bottom.  Meaning you have no choice but to rest it on the screen or the lens in order to charge it, neither of which I'm particularly comfortable doing with my brand new camera.  I compromised by resting it screen down on the wrist strap on top of my desk.  For the money, I think Nikon should include the wall charger.  Now to the Pros and Cons.PROS: I was immediately impressed by the zoom and it's stabilization feature, some griped about the fuzziness of pictures at high zoom, but anyone who's used a good camcorder will tell you that it's near impossible to get a steady shot at high zoom, and I feel this camera's stabilization helps, you will still need something steady to rest on or a Gorilla Pod.  The camera also has a very large aperture which lends itself to better light sensitivity, a zoom shot out of my office confirmed that, while I could barely see it in the dark, at night my living room lamp from about 30 feet away was picked up with no lights on in that room.  The photo was fuzzy from a hand held shot, but the fact that it could even remotely pick it up struck me.  The camera takes great photos outdoors and in good light, as most of the samples in the gallery will show you.  It also has excellent color reproduction both indoors and out in the AUTO mode, something my Canon lacks....However....CONS: One large downside to this camera is it's low light processing. While taking the first shots, I immediately took note of the \"soft\" pictures.  I read the complaints online, and CNET's take on the low light and high ISO degradation, but thought them small gripes...until I used it.  I submitted a picture to the gallery, picking the best indoor low light shots of a thank you card for reference.  I used my old SD750 and my new S9100 in multiple settings in low light (ceiling light), no flash and low light w/ flash. I was shocked.  The SD750 while definitely lower res in the darker shots, reproduces better details, and with the flash on, is almost comparable to the S9100 which has a 5MP larger sensor.  The S9100 is definitely not meant to shoot indoors or in low light.  Of lesser note, are the minimal manual controls and ISO settings, and the noisy zoom and stabilization features, all of which along with the charger awkwardness would be completely excusable, if it weren't for the terrible low light quality.Overall I think this camera has some good features, and being cheaper than Canon's complement with similar zooms, may be attractive to some buyers.  Personally I will be returning this camera for the SX230 or the S95, depending on whether or not I want the zoom.  For the zoom, while the SX230 is a bit awkward to hold, the image quality is more important to me and worth a small sacrifice in shooting comfort and price.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Broke in 45 DAYS", "Author": "Rosaleen", "ReviewID": "R3FZ1SX0ZMP16P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera stopped working yesterday 45 days after I bought it.

I logged onto their online forum and posted my problems with the camera to see if another customer had a similar issue and the POST WAS DELETED within 4 hours.  To me, this shows NIKON knows of the issue and is not taking responsible action to correct the problem.

I've enjoyed my P80 but it is too large to fit easily into my carry-on airline bag and also heavy for carting along on hikes.  The S9100 has the same 18X optical zoom for excellent photos that the P80 has. I have taken wildlife photos with fully extended lens and was able to crop it into a clear photo.  Other photos, including close-up flower photos are exceptionally clear. The fact that I can stick the P9100 in my pocket and go is probably the major difference, and a large one difference, between going for the newer version of the P80 or selecting the S9100.I only have a couple of negative comments.  I do not like the fact that the S9100 has no viewfinder.  It has an improved monitor but still is difficult to focus in outdoor lighting for photos.  I will be keeping my Nikon P80 for some of those chores.  I also dislike not having a complete manual in the box with the S9100.  There was a CD manual in the box, but I am not in the habit of carrying my computer on hikes where I take many of my photos!

My guess was that the same excellent lens that gives us 18x optical zoom is also finicky and hard to focus.  Wrong.  Now I'm consistently getting good clear shots, much faster than before.The key to getting sharp photos is to understand your auto-focus options.  First, we'll assume you already know that pushing the shutter button down half-way triggers the camera to focus.  What happens next depends on the settings for your auto-focus mode.First, put the camera in AUTO mode, then hit the menu button.  Scroll down to Auto-Focus Mode, then tap the right side of the wheel to call up your choices.  The two choices are Autofocus Single, and Autofocus Full Time.  Here are the differences:Autofocus single:  If you push halfway on the shutter button in this mode, focusing and exposure are locked in right away.  If you or the subject move, the focus will not change unless you take your finger off the button and start over.  For me, I was sometimes starting with my finger on the shutter button before the camera was on target, causing the camera to lock focus on the wrong subject.  I learned to just lift my finger and let the camera reset.  This is a good mode if you understand it, because you can lock-in your focus and distance to the target, then snap a pic instantly when you get the exact composure or subject action you want.  For example, your kid is getting ready to blow out his candles.  Get the focus locked in, then when he starts to blow, snap it.If the camera does not acquire a good focus at the start, then the camera might not take a picture!  This may be why some of you are breaking your shutter buttons by mashing them really hard when the camera is not ready to go.Autofocus single is a good mode when you are using the zoom at full extension.  Getting good focus at full zoom takes more time, and this mode lets you lock it in once and hold it.Autofocus full-time:  This is the mode I now use most of the time.  The autofocus continues to track and evaluate the subject(s), even if they or you are moving.  This is especially good if you are asking others to take a picture of you with your own camera.  Friends were putting their fingers on the shutter button too early, then snapping really blurry photos of me and my wife.  That was in Autofocus-Single.  On AF Full Time, it's a lot better.So, if you are having troubles, experiment with these settings, and make sure you understand the effects of touching or resetting the shutter button.This is a terrific zoom and camera for this price point.  A lens capable of 18x optical zoom is not going to focus as quickly as a 4x party camera.  Also, this is the first time I've ever had a camera where the panorama function was so easy to use.  Once you go into panorama mode, you just push the button once, then slowly move the camera in the direction of your pano.  The camera takes the photos and assembles them for you!  Super easy.  I was amazed.I'm only giving this camera four stars because there is not enough manual control over the exposure.  You can only manipulate exposure two full stops either way.  That means I cannot get a clear picture of the moon, for example, even with this 18x zoom because the photo is still overexposed.  If someone knows a shortcut around that problem, let me know in the comments. (Next time I will try center-weighted metering.  It was set on Matrix.)Also, I discovered just last night that if you change the exposure settings, the camera keeps the change locked in, even if you turn it off.  My first photos last night were really dark because I forgot I had reduced the exposure by 2 stops the day before.Hey, Nikon:  The exposure limitation is only a software issue.  How about a firmware upgrade that gives us 7 or 9 full stops of exposure control?  It's just a change to the code, not the hardware.  My father-in-law's cheap Kodak has that feature, and I get good shots of the moon with his, but they're not zoomed in 18x.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "K.

It's getting on the large size to just slip in your pocket, but I use a case that clips onto my belt. That gives it better protection anyways. It fits much better to my man-hands than my last Nikon point and shoot and I don't feel like this one will slip out of my hands. It has good grip and a rubberized texture that helps me to hold onto it. I opted for the black which I think looks the sleekest. The S9100 feels solid in the hands, just the right weight.Powering on is fast, it's ready to shoot within a couple of seconds. It is also the quickest focusing camera I've had and in a normal lit room I don't suffer with shutter lag like I did with my old cameras. I've read reviews before I purchase that some were complaining about how fast the zoom is. I actually like that and depending on how much to move the zoom lever controls how fast it zooms. I hate waiting for a camera to decide it's going to zoom after you've held the lever down. I've missed too many shots because of that. It's not a problem with this camera.This is the first camera I've had that has a dedicated video record button. Just hit the button and you'll be recording HD video. There were several modes of video that you could shoot, 1080p, 720p, high speed, VGA, see the specs for complete listing. The high speed was fun to mess with on moving subjects. Just make sure you have reset the video mode once you are done so you'll be ready next time.There are not many manual controls, but that's not what this camera is geared towards. It's a competent point and shoot with some cool extras. You can change the exposure, flash mode and there a macro mode on/off. There are some creative modes the most fun to play with is the selective color. You can choose a color then you will see and take pictures that are black and white except for anything that registers that chosen color. When you rotate the selector dial into the back lighted subject mode there is a HDR mode. The little I've used HDR on this camera, I would recommend using a tripod to steady the camera. I'm still discovering this feature but will probably still use my DSLR for creating HDR photos.The S9100 is a great all around point and shoot camera. It's quick, takes great crisp pictures, packs a 18x zoom lens, shoot HD video, and has some creative modes to play with.  I think most users that only want a point and shoot or user that have a DSLR and just want an everyday camera will be happy with the S9100. I've been able to get more clear crisp pictures that I do with my DSLR and if force to only have one camera I would keep the S9100.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE This Camera!!...", "Author": "Mercedes J.", "ReviewID": "R2K9E9XWS0RK0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I went to Best Buy, it was only to play with the SLR camera's. I couldn't decide between the Nikon D3100, or the Canon Rebel. After getting a new job as a food photographer, I wanted to upgrade from my current camera, the Kodak Z981, to something with a few more options. I've ALWAYS used only Kodak cameras because of their user friendly operation and editing software. Unfortunately, after only 10 minutes with the SLR's, I realized it was WAAAAAY more camera than I was ever going to use...and I couldn't operate it if my life depended on it. I was getting ready to leave when I figured I'd check out what was new in the world of regular digital cameras. That's when I ran into this little guy.I talked with a very knowledgeable Best Buy associate who, after explaining exactly what I want and need in a camera, pointed me to this camera, and the Nikon Coolpix P500. After playing with both of them and finding them very similar (the only major difference being the P500 has a 35X zoom, which I don't need), I really liked the size of this camera. I never thought in a million years I would go this small when purchasing a new camera, but I absolutely love it.I've taken numerous photos with this camera (mainly of food, since that's what I do), and they are stunning (I've shared some on the black version of this camera)! There's actually a 'Food' setting under scene mode, but I prefer the 'Close-up' setting...makes the colors seem a bit more vivid IMO. I've taken pictures of my son playing outside using both Auto Mode and Sports Mode, and they came out crisp and clear...no blurry hands and legs! I've also taken pics with the zoom extended all the way and even with a slightly shaky hand, the photos came out crystal clear.This camera is super easy to use and you can jump right into taking pictures with ease. I only needed to consult the user manual about a couple things, like how to delete multiple photos at once. If you're a Nikon veteran though, you probably already know how to do this on one of their cameras. I didn't download the software that came with this, the ViewNX 2 program. When I plugged the camera into my computer I was able to send my photos to my Kodak EasyShare Program. I'm just not ready to part with my photo editing software yet, so I'll keep Kodak around for that purpose.Overall, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this camera. If I could change anything about it, it would two things. I would love to switch the Mode Dial and the Shutter Release Button around. I think the shutter button is just a bit too far in towards the middle of the camera. The ideal place for it would be on the far right edge of the top of the camera, where the mode dial currently is. Also, the little door on the bottom of the camera that opens to reveal the USB port is a little flimsy and annoying. It's a rubbery flap you have to pop open then spin around out of the way so you can plug the cord in. It's a cumbersome design since this port gets so much use...it's not only how you get pics onto your computer (unless you take your memory card out and do it that way), but it's also how you charge the battery. OH...and THAT is awesome! To charge your battery, just plug the camera into the wall or your computer...no buying new batteries or having to remove them from the camera to put them in a charger (my Kodak was like that...4 AA batteries that have to be removed and placed in a wall charger...VERY aggravating to have to remember to bring the charger with us on vacations. Even more aggravating when I forget).Well, I think that about covers it. This is a great little camera, but don't be fooled by it's small size. It has TONS of features, settings, editing options right on the camera itself (my favorite is Miniature Mode), and an 18X zoom! I'm a little sad to be ending my lifelong relationship with Kodak cameras but, judging by how great this Nikon has been in the few short weeks I've had it, I think I'll get over it.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for video", "Author": "Jeff in Austin", "ReviewID": "R275QQZY1S8V3L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lucked out and got this as a present from my wife.  I have nver before shot video, and have only used point-and-shoot cameras. I had done some research, and based on that, selected a completely different camera.  She knows cameras, she did her own research, and compared her results to what I came up with, and determined that this Nikon S9100 was way better than what I had picked.  I am happy she did.I have not yet used it much for its primary purpose, still photos.  But I have used the video function, and love it.  The zoom is unbelievable.  I shot a video of a rock band, and I could zoom up while I was shooting video to get a close-up of the guitarist's fingers, the guitar logo, everything.  I play in a band, and I have some specialized recording gear that I use to record our audio.  The audio that the Nikon s9100 recorded almost matched my specialized gear for sound quality.  I've never seen any video camera that could do that, including very high end ones.The video file format is .MOV, which is not recognized by some of the main common video players/editors (e.g., Windows Movie Maker), so that is a bit of a pain. Adobe Premier Elements (the \"lite\" version of the video equivalent to PhotoShop) handles it. The S9100 has an easy choice of video quality (HD in 1080p, etc.).  On the highest level HD, it uses about 100 MB per minute (e.g., a 5-min video of 1080p HD would take up about a half a gigabyte).  So with a 16 GB card, you can shoot about a half hour of top quality HD video, with high quality audio.I uploaded my very first video to YouTube, and I am a total first-timer at shooting video.  You can see for yourself how it came out.  This was shot indoors, in the early evening, and the lighting was not the best.  It would have been brighter had I shot it an hour earlier in the day. I also did not have a tripod, so it is a bit shaky in spots. Also, even though I shot this in HD, somehow by the time it got edited to add the titles, and then uploaded to YouTube, it was no longer in HD.  The original file in the camera is much sharper. So part of my next learning steps is figuring out how to maintain the HD clarity as it gets processed in the video editor and the YouTube upload process.  Anyway, this was shot from about 50 feet back from stage, maybe more. This includes the sound actually picked up by the camera.  Check it out:  youtube.com/watch?v=MQ23cw_114IOne thing I can say about the still photo side of the camera, is it may take a bit of adjusting to keep from over-exposoing shots.  My first attempts at still photos seem to have way too much light in them (sort of washed out).As for the size of the camera, when it is turned off (ie, the lens isn't extended), it is about the size of two iPhones stacked, with one sitting on top of the other.

If you leave the flash down it is off and cannot be turned on by the camera settings, the screen tells you to \"pop the flash\".  It you pop the flash up you can set it to auto, red eye etc. but as soon as you put the flash down again or put the camera in your pocket it turns the flash off and you have to turn it on again and reset the preference again.Now the bad part!  This camera is full of bugs and as I have been reading the reviews on Nikon's own website I find that I don't just have a bad camera, the camera is bad.It turns itself off with warning, not as in auto turn off, right in the middle of taking a picture.

I use the Panasonic whenever I know I'm going some place that the size of the camera will not be a hindrance.  It's the size and shape of a typical SLR camera.  It also takes incredible pictures - even in my hands.  Love it.  I use the S200 for everything else.  It's a nice albeit limited camera.  The zoom is only 3x and the flash leaves something to be desired.I purchased the S9100 to replace the S200 and will keep the S200 around in the glove box for times I didn't bring one of the others and to use as a sort of \"I don't care what happens to it\" camera like when skiing or sailing.For testing purposes I put the S9100 head to head with the Panasonic.  I took pictures at various zoom lengths, in different lighting conditions both with and without flash and snapped some moving pictures of kids riding bikes, cars going down the street and people playing with their dogs in the nearby park.  I would snap a picture with the Panasonic and then with the S9100.  While the moving pictures were impossible to truly replicate I kept things as consistent as I could with zoom length, using or not using flash, etc..  Then, I took them back home, removed the SD cards and looked at the photos on my PC using Picasa.The S9100 consistently took absolutely fabulous pictures.  It equaled the Panasonic in clarity and overall true-to-life representation.  Plus, it bested the Panasonic in low light situations and the extra zoom length (the Panasonic maxes out at 12x) allowed me to get in a little closer.The S9100 has a personality.  You could almost call it an attitude.  Sometimes, it couldn't focus perfectly creating a blurry picture.  This was solved by either changing the zoom or stepping forwards or back a step.  It wasn't often and the Panasonic displayed some of the same behavior.  The S9100 seemed to perform flawlessly if what I was photographing was maybe 4 feet away or further.  Up closer, it would sometimes have focus difficulty.  What you see on the screen is absolutely what you get.

The best way I can best describe the S9100 picture quality is like this: my pictures often looked like something shot with my child's digital toy camera.After studying the user's manual, I attempted all types of adjustments to settings, scene modes, ISO, metering, megapixels, flash mode, etc.  Also, I made sure my lens was clean and my hands were not shaking.  Unfortunately, the majority of shots were blurry, and especially worse for indoor pictures.  I'd estimate that the S9100 gave me a good looking picture only 10% -20% of the time.I considered that my particular camera was defective, but I see others complaining of similar problems with the S9100.  I'll be returning mine.

I am not a professional photographer, but not a novice either. The camera is just not able to really produce consistent quality images. There is either something wrong with the software or the lens itself (i believe it is the lens).The 18x feature and the speed is excellent - if they were to actually produce good shots. But they do not. More often than not, you'll find that the pictures are less than stellar. Actually, they'll be pretty horrible. Additionally, the lock up on the lens WILL happen to you after the first 100+ images you take. It will just freeze. After you reset it, you'll also experience periodic noises whenever you zoom in and out - like it's ready to break.I really wanted to like this camera - it had such great potential - but unfortunately, it just has too many problems that just can't be ignored.Doing a good amount of research, and even looking at the reviews here, you'll find that this is a common problem with s9100 and no support is currently being offered by Nikon.

Suresh Kumar \"Suresh\"", "ReviewID": "R981MXVD2SU8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before buying this camera I went through most of the customer reviews on cameras in Amazon. Every camera had positives and negatives and totally confused me to Zero down on a good camera. The S9100 had lot of features which I was looking for. Also there were only 3 customer reviews. I took a risk and brought it. I have used it for nearly 10 times in 2 months, I think it is a good time to review this camera.Here are the pros and cons I would like to discuss. Overall I am happy with the camera.Pros:1. There is no manual with this camera. It's inside the DVD given. Good to know Nikon is taking environmental friendly path. If you go through the manual couple of times you will understand how to use the camera effectively. The menus are user friendly, there is no need to drill down much, just two levels you can find your option.2. Wide Angle lens, this is one of the superb feature I personally experienced, I took the photo of my friends in the van from the front seat of a van and it covered all of them which is not possible with normal lens.3. 18x Zoom, this is ultimate. You can get good pictures without using Tripod, out of 10 pics taken with full zoom, 9 comes out good. Zoom is not effective during night times, you will find lot of grains in the image.4. The auto scene select mode is good, it senses correctly. I was quite surprised with its accuracy.5. The picture may not be sharp and looks flattened but never goes bad. This is hard to compare until you look at a photo taken at the same spot with a SLR or any other good camera. The option to save as RAW format could have helped a lot.6. Vertical Sweep panaroma is an interesting feature which helps to take tall tombs or buildings.Cons:1. There is no RAW format in this camera, so the photos we take are flattened. I compared the picture taken in my friend's Canon camera (don't remember the model number), it was quite sharp and could see the depth in images which was missing here. The pics compared were taken in Scene Auto select mode.2. When we zoom in and out, you can feel the camera slightly shaking in your hands, its not smooth, I thought it is mechanical problem only in my camera, when I checked similar models in Best Buy same problem existed. But this is not affecting anything in the performance of the camera.3. There is no view finder or a switch to Off the LCD, so the LCD is always ON draining the battery. Incase you are waiting for something to click you need to keep it On for long time.4. You can't review the photos you have taken while charging the battery. Quite unhappy here, need to wait till the battery gets charged.5. Memory Card also plays a major role, go for above Class 6 and a good brand. By mistake took Class 4 and it takes long time to save the pictures in burst mode. The camera hangs till the picture gets saved. It's not camera's mistake.6. Sweep panaroma worked good while testing at home, but failed near a beautiful falls. I tried several times there and failed. Probably this would have failed as the water keeps flowing where it can't merge images.7. While taking pictures of close by objects with Flash, you can't reduce the intensity of the flash and the picture looks whitish. There is an option to reduce whiteness but it is not helping me to get the natural output.8. Force flash mode is not working. I am still finding out how to enable it.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed.", "Author": "Beadseller \"Beadseller\"", "ReviewID": "R21W6HNFVJ72Y3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have returned this camera.

I am the average user, who doesn't know what all the acronyms for cameras even mean, but I am writing this review for the average user who wants to know how good this camera is from that standpoint.Before purchasing this camera, I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and finally bought the S9100. Here are my impressions:Picture Quality: I am the type of user who wants to have great quality photos and not have to edit them afterward too much. From this standpoint, this camera excels in most regards. Outdoor pictures with a steady hand produced for me some of the most amazing photos I have ever seen on a Point-and-Shoot camera of this price range. Indoor photos with the flash seem to be standard quality, but the low light ability for this camera is actually pretty impressive. I took a few photos of a darker hallway in my house but the camera picked up everything and made it all visible. For this price range, indoor quality is standard. Outdoor quality with outdoor lighting is amazing.Effects: The effects on this thing are just great. U can set it so it takes black and white photos, or you can choose a color that shows and everything else is black and white. It adds a whole depth to the camera taking experience and is really fun to toy around with instead of having to edit the picture black and white in photoshop. Wife loves it.Video Quality: This is where I get a little more nit-picky with my hardware. I love taking videos, and have used multiple types of video devices from Flip Video HDs to a $600 Sony Handycam I used to own. This Nikon S9100 has superb quality for video being its secondary function. If anyone reading this has used a Flip Video HD, the quality of this camera I would say doubles the quality of the Flip. I am putting my Flip up for sale now, because for a $300 price tag, I have a great Point and shoot camera with excellent video quality, killing two birds with one stone.Battery Life: I used the camera for photos and random videos throughout the day at my sons birthday party, and the camera lasted all day, needing a recharge later that night. To me, as an average user, that is what I want in a camera, last all day and recharge at night. Not sure if techno-gurus out there will say that is not long enough, but I feel it is.Zoom: The zoom really shines on this thing, but you must have a steady hand the closer you get, im used to that on point and shoot cameras now a-days.Photo/Video Access and file type: So this is a big area for me that not a lot of people write about. When I had my Sony Handycam, I didnt realize when buying it that it had a Sony video format that I would end up having to convert to a different format just to view on most home theater devices. You also had to use the Sony software to get your videos off the device. This Nikon S9100 uses a .MOV file type, which so far has been able to play with any media player and on any device I plug it into. I just browse to the device through My Computer and I can get the files there, very simple and not much tech knowledge involved.Conclusion: All in all, this camera for the price kills two birds with one stone. You get a very high quality, excellent outdoor photo camera with great zoom, plus you get a very high quality (1080p) video camera. The camera is very user friendly and I believe any average person looking for excellent photo/video quality will not be disappointed.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is an awesome camera!!!", "Author": "T.

Nikon has improved their P&S;'s considerably, but it still isn't up to canon's & even though it was close enough that w/ the 18x on this camera I might have considered it, the image stabilzation wasn't good enough (at least for me) to allow me to hand hold at that amount of zoom even though I would love to have that range.  It also jumps from optical to digital zoom without notice, just by continuing to hold the zoom lever, so you can end up at 24x very rapidly w/o realizing it & REALLY have a hard time hand holding.  For me that made the high end zoom almost non-functional.

I couldn't decide between the Nikon D3100, or the Canon Rebel. After getting a new job as a food photographer, I wanted to upgrade from my current camera, the Kodak Z981, to something with a few more options. I've ALWAYS used only Kodak cameras because of their user friendly operation and editing software. Unfortunately, after only 10 minutes with the SLR's, I realized it was WAAAAAY more camera than I was ever going to use...and I couldn't operate it if my life depended on it. I was getting ready to leave when I figured I'd check out what was new in the world of regular digital cameras. That's when I ran into this little guy.I talked with a very knowledgeable Best Buy associate who, after explaining exactly what I want and need in a camera, pointed me to this camera, and the Nikon Coolpix P500. After playing with both of them and finding them very similar (the only major difference being the P500 has a 35X zoom, which I don't need), I really liked the size of this camera. I never thought in a million years I would go this small when purchasing a new camera, but I absolutely love it.I've taken numerous photos with this camera (mainly of food, since that's what I do), and they are stunning (I've shared some on the black S9100 page)! There's actually a 'Food' setting under scene mode, but I prefer the 'Close-up' setting...makes the colors seem a bit more vivid IMO. I've taken pictures of my son playing outside using both Auto Mode and Sports Mode, and they came out crisp and clear...no blurry hands and legs!  I've also taken pics with the zoom extended all the way and even with a slightly shaky hand, the photos came out crystal clear.This camera is super easy to use and you can jump right into taking pictures with ease. I only needed to consult the user manual about a couple things, like how to delete multiple photos at once. If you're a Nikon veteran though, you probably already know how to do this on one of their cameras. I didn't download the software that came with this, the ViewNX 2 program. When I plugged the camera into my computer I was able to send my photos to my Kodak EasyShare Program. I'm just not ready to part with my photo editing software yet, so I'll keep Kodak around for that purpose.Overall, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this camera. If I could change anything about it, it would two things. I would love to switch the Mode Dial and the Shutter Release Button around. I think the shutter button is just a bit too far in towards the middle of the camera. The ideal place for it would be on the far right edge of the top of the camera, where the mode dial currently is. Also, the little door on the bottom of the camera that opens to reveal the USB port is a little flimsy and annoying. It's a rubbery flap you have to pop open then spin around out of the way so you can plug the cord in. It's a cumbersome design since this port gets so much use...it's not only how you get pics onto your computer (unless you take your memory card out and do it that way), but it's also how you charge the battery. OH...and THAT is awesome! To charge your battery, just plug the camera into the wall or your computer...no buying new batteries or having to remove them from the camera to put them in a charger (my Kodak was like that...4 AA batteries that have to be removed and placed in a wall charger...VERY aggravating to have to remember to bring the charger with us on vacations. Even more aggravating when I forget).Well, I think that about covers it. This is a great little camera, but don't be fooled by it's small size. It has TONS of features, settings, editing options right on the camera itself (my favorite is Miniature Mode), and an 18X zoom!

It's a good size and beautiful design, easy to handle and use.  The wide angle to extreme zoom is fantastic in theory.  I absolutely loved the quick and intuitive menu set-up and feature access.  I also loved the push button access for video, and both shooting video and playing it back are faster and easier than any of my Canons.  Indoor flash tests showed the flash to be exceptionally strong compared to what you tend to see on these small type cameras.  Flash could light up a moderate very dark room quite evenly and well.  Shooting outside in good, even light produced generally good, sharp photos, although the color didn't \"pop\" as much as with other cameras, and in some cases tended to look a bit washed out.  Photos shot indoors without flash and in fairly modest light came out surprisingly well exposed.  I liked the flash setup in which you flick a little switch on the side to pop up the flash before shooting, and I preferred this to Canon's pop-up light on the S95, something most users seem to complain about.What I didn't like was the overall photo quality, and the problems arose when zooming in even a bit.  I was initially intrigued with this camera precisely because of the zoom range (and wider wide angle of 24mm), two things I've missed having on my previous small digital cameras (which tend to be limited to a range of about 28 to 100 or so).  However,  when zooming in it was almost impossible to get a good, sharp photo unless using a tripod or bracing the camera on something, and even braced or tripod shots weren't all that good.  Most of the zoomed photos I shot were completely unacceptable.  Why have such a great zoom range if you can't even get good photos with it?This also seems to be a camera one would probably shoot mostly in Auto, and overall, there weren't a lot of creative choices in the menus.  I guess I'd characterize this camera as an automatic with an extended zoom.  Photos shot at the widest angle (a nice 24mm) were always the best in terms of sharpness.  Zoom in even a little and the blur problems start.  It became clear that if out and about shooting things quickly, one would end up with mostly bad, out of focus photos.I was deciding between the Nikon S9100 to the Canon S95.  Yes, I know they are very different animals.  I've been interested in the S90/S95 for a couple of years mainly because I wanted the degree of manual control it offered and because of the high image quality it supposedly had.  I decided to compare the two cameras in terms of which tradeoffs I wanted to go with, so I brought both the S9100 and the S95 home to try out.  My choice was between the functional ease of use and wider wide angle (24mm)  plus extreme telephoto capabilities of the Nikon S9100, or give that up to get the manual controls and low light capabilities of the Canon, with its more typical 28-105 zoom. I also wasn't sure if the Canon's capabilities would turn out to be mostly hype or not, and I wasn't sure if the Nikon's photo quality would be good by comparison.I took identical photos with both cameras, and the differences became starkly obvious:  the Nikon simply couldn't compare to the Canon in terms of photo quality, color rendition and sharpness.  In every pair of photos I took, the Canon was superior in every way.  I quickly lost interest in the Nikon as a result, despite the many operating features on it which I actually liked a lot more than on the Canon.  However,  it had to come down to photo quality, and having done a side by side comparison with both cameras shooting the same scenes in the same light, the Canon's photos were without exception beautiful and sharp with rich vibrant color while the Nikon's shots were mostly just so-so at best to downright bad, and far too often they were noticeably out of focus and with fairly bland color, a tendency towards looking washed out, and occasionally with an obvious off-color cast.Interestingly, I got sharp, crisp photos from the Canon taken without tripod at the highest digital zoom of 15x (that was a huge surprise to me, I would have expected some fuzziness) while the Nikon couldn't seem to shoot very sharply even at a modest optical level zoom.  Full zoom was impossibly out of focus.  Very very disappointing and a definite deal breaker.  I have the feeling that the image stabilization capabilities of the Canon S95 must be far superior to Nikon's system, which didn't seem to work all that well from what I could see. In all my test photos, the Canon focus was perfect on virtually all of them, but the Nikon produced more bad photos than good ones.  The Nikon photos were considerably inferior to even what I get from my older Canon 800IS and 960IS, both of which take very good photos most of the time.So I returned the Nikon and kept the Canon S95.  I'll add that I've used and been very dedicated to Nikons since the F4's I bought in 1980 ( both still working perfectly), plus I have two other Nikon DSLR's that are wonderful.  However, it does seem that in the realm of the pocket sized digital cameras, Canon is still superior, I'm sad to say.  I'd love to find a Nikon pocket digital that measures up to the quality of its larger cameras, but Nikon just isn't there yet with the pocket digitals, and I'm actually surprised they would release a camera such as the S9100 as it seems like the obvious failures of this camera would  diminish Nikon's legendary reputation.  There also appear to be a lot of reliability issues judging from what I've read in reviews, although in the short time I had the Nikon, I didn't see any of that, everything performed without a hitch.  Rather for me, it was entirely an issue of poor photo quality and very weak focusing capabilities.  I didn't test the video very much on the 9100 because that isn't a feature I'm especially interested in.  The video quality seemed fine, and as I noted earlier, it was very easy to use the video functions quickly.  But overall, I was extremely disappointed in this camera's performance and found its photo quality unacceptable on any level.

If you are focusing on something, and there is a red box, the camera CANNOT focus at that distance and you need to change it (this usually meant backing off the zoom).  I was really disappointed at first, because why HAVE an 18x optical zoom if you can't USE it, but it focuses exceptionally at highest zoom on objects that are far enough away!  Also when doing extreme closeups, you have to remember to turn on the macro mode.  I really can't go into the whole manual here, but suffice it to say that although this is a point and shoot camera, it is VERY feature rich, and it isn't necessarily an out of the box positive experience.  Now, I actually dislike reading, but I found a Nikon app for my IPhone4 that had tutorials on the Coolpix Cameras.

I was trying to get up close photos of me with my dogs by the Christmas tree, holding it in crazy ways so most came out blurry, but it could be me... not handling the camera properly. I could be too quick to judge.  More than several shots were blurry..not one here and there....so that is why I say there could be a foucs issue...still too early to tell just yet. I tried macro mode, auto mode pet portrait and portrait...?  There were some clear shots...I will post a few samples to the review page.  Look for denbink.However, there was no lens lock up or camera lock up like I read from other reviews.. but it is still too early to tell.I do have up to Jan ....? to return the camera...Christmas time allowance. I own other point and shoot Nikon Coolpix's, but I have to say...Nikon's point and shoot cameras are not thier strong ( product ) points.  The DSLR family from Nikon is the most awesome line of DSLR's out there.. I own 3 Nikon DSLR's.  But..can't carry them everywhere, you know.I also own a Nikon coolpix S8000...it's ok.  I keep trying to find the best Nikon point and shoot...not having a lot of luck.  I am constantly reading all sorts of comments, good and bad, so all I can say is...it's all based on opinions.  You really need to try them yourself.  Check all return policies before you buy your new...or REFURBS, but I am sure all of you know to do this..right?  BUY NIKON MANUFACTURED REFURBISHED!  MAINLY BECAUSE.. Most bugs are already out of the refurbs..THEY WORK GREAT!July 26th 2012 Update: I Find I am having some lens issues.  One time It had a lens error but that was just it .... one time.  Then...If I change my zoom or settings, it blurrs.  I turn off the camera and turn it on at the setting I changed it to and its ok then.  It still takes good pictures but I don't like the focusing issue I have with it now.  I feel like sending it in to Nikon for a fix.  But..it's not that bad of an issue to do that, just yet.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great support", "Author": "J.

Also did some work as a sports photographer.I was looking for a good small camera with a long zoom  range so I can take along with my SLR's.I bought the camera in April and have used it on 2 trips. The pictures that is camera takes are very good. The zoom lens is great. I was choosing between this camera and the Canon SX230HS and I chose the Nikon because I didn't like the pop-up flash situation on the Canon. This is my 2nd Nikon camera in my 30 plus years of shooting pictures (I've always used Canon; pocket and SLR's).The only problem so far has been the locking up (freezing) situation that most have experienced. I talked to Nikon support on the phone and they were great. I sent the camera in for repair and they fixed the freezing situation at no charge to me. Great service and support. I understand that electronics are not perfect and when problems do arise you want a company that stands behind their product and fixes it quickly at no charge to you.To summarize: great little camera. It's not a camera you would buy if you want MANUAL controls because it is all automatic. Had 1 problem  but Nikon repaired the problem quickly and at no charge.Didn't elaborate too much on features because it's all shown on this website and at the Nikon website.Hope this helps!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous camera - I've no idea why people run so warm and cold on it", "Author": "ZTT Fan", "ReviewID": "RVVKYKDO14LDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In short, this is a wonderful camera that has allowed me to take photos I never could have otherwise.I've read lots of reports of \"blurry photos\" with this camera, but I suspect at least some of those people don't realize that at maximum zoom you need to be nearly rock stable with this camera, even with VR turned on; I suspect at least some of the others have had defective units.The zoom lens is the best part of this camera, allowing for amazing concert photos in a variety of lighting conditions, great landscapes and just all-around awesome photos at times I don't feel like lugging or can't use my DSLR.I take a fair amount of concert photos, and this camera unobtrusively fits into a pocket and is great for photos at venues that allow \"point and shoot\" or \"personal use\" cameras but not \"professional cameras.\" When comparing photos taken with the S9100 and those taken with my DSLR, many people can't tell the difference, and in fact I've printed numerous enlargements from images taken with the S9100 and absolutely love the quality.My two biggest gripes with the camera are the lack of full manual controls - you have to more or less pick a camera mode that \"comes close\" and adjust the photo as possible using the exposure controls - and the fact that it doesn't shoot in RAW mode. Also note that the auto mode does tend to overexpose slightly; I almost always set exposure to -0.3 stop and then don't need to overcorrect the results in Photoshop.If you want to investigate other cameras, that's fine, but few other cameras of this size have such a powerful zoom lens, and that's why I purchased and LOVE my S9100.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Freezing on Vacation", "Author": "P.

I have a Panasonic ZS3 and it has served me well, but I wanted a longer zoom.  While there were a fair number of reviews of the Panasonic and Canon, there weren't as many of the other cameras, including the Nikon.  The Canon had pretty good reviews, but the image quality seems to be worse in the recent Panasonic cameras, and the ZS10 was panned by several sites for this reason.  One review highly recommended the Nikon:[...]So I bought the camera and took it to South Africa.  It was my backup camera and the one I used when I didn't want to carry around my DSLR camera.  I got some very good photos and learned some things in the process.  First, 18x is a heckuva zoom in a compact camera.  When you go to full zoom, it is hard to keep from shaking the camera when you press the shutter.  So for low light shots at full zoom, use the 2 sec timer to separate the pressing of the shutter button from the actual exposure.  This really reduces blurring in this situation.  Second, I found the auto scene select feature frustrating, and did better using the auto mode or selecting the scene mode myself.  Third, yeah, at high iso values there is some noise in low light photos, but no worse than the competition and better in some cases.  And I got decent shots even up to 1600 iso as long as I didn't try and blow them up too big (5x7 would be ok).  Fourth, there may be a little softness in some shots, but many shots are very sharp, especially when you consider the 18x lens in this compact camera.Of course, several reviews came out after I bought the camera and returned from my trip.

The review I found at PCWorld.com of the top 10 pocket megazooms was glowing by virtue of the features packed into it for the price.  I took the time to read the reviews and opinions here as well as other sites, including the Nikon forums, which led to the reason for the low price:  a significant pattern of malfunction, appearing to be design or firmware related that the manufacturer has chosen to address through repair service.  Despite this, I decided to take stock in Nikon's supposed history of quality and the one year manufacturer warranty.Out of the box everything worked very well.  Two months later the notorious \"lens error\" rendered the camera inoperable.  I shipped it to the Nikon service center in El Segundo, California (at my own expense since the warranty only covers return shipping).  They replaced the lens unit and \"upgraded the bios\" and shipped it back (Note:  Nikon's service center work is guaranteed for 180 days after repair).  It has performed flawlessly since (nearly two months as of this posting), and I've been stress testing it with long sessions of shooting and filming until the battery is exhausted.FEATURES AND FUNCTION:  I must disclose that this is my first digital camera purchase.  I spent many hours pouring over online reviews and walking through stores examining the different models.The features of the camera are quite good in my opinion.  The stills produced are of good quality for something beneath a SLR with a good array of color modifying modes and after effects, whether in-camera or included PC software.  Autofocus can be temperamental at times but not much trouble.  The video function does very well for what is ostensibly a camera primarily designed for taking stills and the audio is of decent quality, though the lens noise from autofocus and especially zooming are quite noticeable.  Portrait mode works nicely since it will auto-detect faces and track them in motion (also in Pet mode).  I enjoy the \"close up\" setting very much, as it allows for adjusting the focal point to places other than dead center of the field of view (e.g., far lower left).  The Panorama feature (180\u00b0 & 360\u00b0) produces pleasing results, whether using the \"easy\" mode or the \"assisted\" tripod mode.SUM UP:  The features and options are solidly good for the money.

The reviews have been mixed and here is what I make of them.Poor reviews are caused by three factors out of synch with each other, each user caused. 1. shutter speed. You cannot expect a 1/30 sec picture no matter how steady your hand is not to have some sharpness loss due to jitter. Stablilization helps but it is not a panacea. 2. Jitter becomes more exaggerated the more you zoom long. The zoom goes out to approx 450mm in 35mm terms. It is virtually  impossible to hand hold for sharpness at shutter speeds under 1/1000 sec and 3. premature shutter release...you need to wait for the green square to show and then gently press the shutter release past the halfway point. one more point....autofocus performance decreases with lower light, lack of contrast in the subject and very long focal lengths. That causes failure to lock on. Setting the AF to center priority does help somewhat.I shot about 75 test shots yesterday, controlling for these factors and all but 10 were more than acceptable.Hope this helps.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Julie A.

Don't get me wrong, I had a decent Contax 159 35mm in my day, along with several nice Zeiss lenses but I no longer want to lug such a device around. Just give me something easy to carry and the ability to manually control basic camera functions, oh and a wide and long range zoom and I'm happy!I really like the extended zoom of this camera. Note the top mm isn't actually a lot more than my 10x Panasonic because the Nikon is a fair amount wider at the low end but even with the added low end(which I really like and would trade off for a little less top end) it still gave more top end zoom than my TZ1 Panny.The image stabilization works quite well when in the higher X's but only after you push the shutter 1/2 way and you hear some motor type of noise, maybe it uses some kind of mechanical type of stabilization?The picture quality is just fine IMO, I don't know that I'd call it night and day better than my Panny but then I never had a issue with the Panny either.I haven't really played around with the movie option of this camera but on paper it sounds nice. I just got a class 10 micro SD card(which I must use with a adapter to bring it up to a regular SD to use in this camera) so I'll probably be playing with that in the future.Likes:Very compact, especially if you consider the very wide range zoom.Wide range zoom.Ability to use lower priced non OEM batteries. Panasonic is #*&% and installs a chip in their OEM batteries disallowing one to purchase aftermarket batteries! The gall that you have to pay more for their batteries because they install a chip not letting you use lower priced batteries.Dislikes:No supplied manual, took me several hours to print out and assemble a pocket sized manual(8 pages per sheet of paper 4 back to back). I know some people use a smart phone but NOT me, I like to look at a paper manual.Popup flash is a + and -. The plus is it's easy to turn OFF the flash, simply don't raise it. The negative is it's right where my finger tends to hold the camera. I can work around it but I'd call it somewhat a negative.NO way to turn off battery icon either on the LCD screen or WORSE yet when displaying on your TV via HDMI or composite output! I can almost see being on all the time for LCD but cannot fathom why someone would ALWAYS want to look at a battery icon when viewing movies on a large LCD, just stupid IMO! Yes I read the whole manual and called Nikon, they confirmed no way to ever turn off the battery icon(note HDMI is NOT active when the camera is charging, tried that too).I'll try and add more +'s and -'s as I run across them.A couple accessories I purchased at Amazon for use with this camera:HDMI to mini HDMI conversion cable to allow camera to hook to my HDTV:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104XCVO/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_detailsSD micro card along with adapter, class 10 for shooting HD:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00698ZUHK/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details2 replacement batteries and AC/DC charger which allow you to charge batteries outside of camera:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D8M4DM/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_detailsDecent horizontal neoprene case holds camera quite well although being soft it doesn't provide a ton of protection:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NXUMGI/ref=oh_o01_s01_i00_detailsVery protective case(I had before I purchased camera)and the 9100 just fits in perfect. Note my case does NOT have a clear lid which is good. My Pelican 1010 Micro Case Series has a black lid with black rubber not only on the bottom but also TOP for total all sides protection. While the clear might be nice to see whats inside it doesn't allow the top to have rubber to protect whats inside. I also glued a belt loop to the back of mine(PL400) so I can hook it to my belt as a very protective horizontal case. Note the belt loop should be attached so when on your belt the hinge is on the bottom which lets it gently swing down and your camera doesn't fall out. Anyway this is a similar case to what I'm using with great success:http://www.amazon.com/Pelican-Watertight-Micro-Rubber-Liner/dp/B000KNNPGI/ref=sr_1_40?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327193777&sr;=8-406 month update, mostly adding to the - column:When playing back anything from the camera to my TV(via HDMI or composite video) the battery condition icon(upper right corner of screen) stays ON!!! No way to turn it OFF. I'd love to shot the idiot engineer who that that was a good idea. Why would I want a battery icon on my screen when watching movies(or pictures) is beyond me, it's totally STUPID. I scoured the manual and finally called Canon and after 30 minutes was told it was not possible to disable this icon. Apparently older Canon cameras had the option to disable the icon but not this camera???Another major - is everything out of the composite video output is letterboxed!! Event though my video is shot wide screen when it comes out from the composite it has black bars top, bottom, left and right, simply STUPID! HDMI is full screen but I have a older wide screen HDTV with only component(HD) and composite inputs, no HDMI inputs. Hooking this camera up to that TV via composite I only get a postage stamp picture which I can then ZOOM to fill my screen but the picture quality really lacks. Unlike some devices(DVD players for example) this Canon has no settings for full screen composite, MAJOR flaw IMO.Another - is you cannot keep the AC power hooked to the camera when playing back (pictures or videos) to your TV. Hooking up the charging cable disables all A/V output!! Another STUPID feature. Besides having the icon on the screen all the time my battery dies after ~20 minutes of playback and I have to turn the camera OFF to charge it!Basically Canon doesn't want you to use the camera as a playback device, they probably want you to put your card in your PC and watch things that way.

About 2 weeks after purchase, the camera started freezing up and could only be turned off by removing the battery. I contacted Nikon and the problem was covered under warranty. I sent the camera in (at my expense) and they fixed the freezing problem, but I was without a camera for over one month while it was in the shop.It is now Thanksgiving weekend, the shutter is not opening all (or closing) all the way, and the camera is not usable.I just remailed Nikon product support about the shutter problem as well as the focusing issue and the autoresponse said they will get back to me in one business day.I really regret buying this camera. At first I thought it was just a lemon but have since read about many other people having the same problems. I think the whole series has problems.

The original review for the S9100 follows:This camera was purchased to photograph print; which actually requires excellent resolution and low light capability.  We've been using a far less expensive Nikon Koolpix that has preformed remarkably well in all areas except low-light, so we had great hopes for this camera.  The only general use it has had was to photograph a dog, which came out beautifully.I've had reservations about the camera from the moment it was turned on, the barrel operation was not smooth.  A co-worker felt that wasn't a big deal, I'm less certain.  Getting consistent results in low light is tricky, I'd advise using the flash.  Also, the focus, as reported by others, is problematic in low-light.  No wonder even local stores are offering this camera at $130 off the original price.However, the technical specs. are remarkable for a camera that cost around $200: 18 X optical zoon, reportedly special features for low light use etc.  It may also take some time to learn the workarounds for some of the many problems listed by other reviewers, but there probably are workarounds.  Our limited use of QuickTime \"movie making\" has yielded impressive results, especially considering how long a shot one can record.I'm keeping the camera but went back to the store and purchased a 2 year warranty (for $17), I'm hoping to learn more workarounds and that the lower-than-normal use will make this $200 purchase last.

Reisman \"midnitdr\"", "ReviewID": "RSZB738Y1ESEF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera but I think that in trying to add some very high end features Nikon has sacrificed durability and ease of use.  The addition of the 18X lens in this little package may just be the stick that has broken the camels back.  I bought this camera in April 2011 after trying out the S8100.  I really liked the feature that the flash has a separate pop up lens.  I also figured the 18x zoom would be nice - although I was aware that there would be a lot of blur at full zoom hand-held, it was still nice to have that feature.  With only one month of shooting the camera froze up and wouldn't work.  I got it replaced from Costco where I bought it even though I was worried this was a very bad sign - I still like the features better then the 8100 model.  I did have trouble with mixed results on the pictures - some were excellent and some were blurry but I was willing to work with that and assumed over time I would be able to find what settings would work best.  Then my main trip of the year - I am out in the desert and even though this was the most dust free year for this area - the small amount of dust in the air was enough to put my camera out of commission after shooting only 5 or so photos.  The zoom stopped extending and retracting and the camera would not close unless I disconnected and reconnected the battery.  It wouldn't even take a simply picture unless I smacked it on the side.  There was a grinding whirring noise coming from it's little engine that I had never heard before.  I had not dropped it or done anything harsh with the camera.  In fact I am not even sure if the dust is the issue - but that is an educated guess since that might explain the problems with the extension and retraction of the lens.  Bottom line - this camera needed a strong engine to drive the lens and a better cover design that would allow it to open and retract even with some dust on the side of the lens and not allow the dust to get into the working mechanisms.  My old 3100 took a beating on a trip across Italy and worked beautifully without a hitch.  I have since had the 4100 and the 6100 series - the 6100 did require a good cleaning after a dusty shoot but actually continued to work and only stopped when I was trying to clean the lens and accidentally jammed it while it was retracting.  (I later learned that just a gentle twist would have freed it and never had that problem again.)  So the final verdict - if you don't need a camera right away, wait and see what the next generation cool-pix is like or maybe consider another brand, although I hate to say that after years of loving my cool pix cameras.  The 8100 might also be an option if you can't wait - but I really prefer the pop up flash so it isn't going off all the time when I don't want it to flash.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "The camera I've always wanted---then I hated it.", "Author": "Tom Cuillier", "ReviewID": "RXISJ2S06L0M3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This S9100 is the camera I have always wanted---megazoom, great pictures, easy to use, but sophisticated enough to do creative projects.

(And I did a LOT of research!!!)  After being convinced that the cameras were practically the same (there were equal pros and cons to each), I went with this Nikon because of the greater zoom (18x vs. 14x) and the unique ability to take pictures WHILE filming video.After owning the camera for awhile, I find the picture quality to be \"excellent.\"  The low-light technology seems to be excellent also; it helps because I take a lot of pictures at concerts.  This camera is a GREAT value for an intermediate photographer, who wants professional-quality photographs.The only negative thing I would say at this point is that it takes awhile to \"get to know\" all of the settings that make this camera so versatile.  It takes great photos without knowing how to use all of its features; however, to make the most out of the camera, it'll take some time.  Also, learning how to focus the camera takes a little practice, when doing artistic shots, but its easy to shoot \"everyday\" kinds of pictures (landscapes and portraits).Overall, this is a wonderful camera that I would recommend to anyone who wants one of the most technologically advanced (with low-light technology), most affordable cameras (try to get it on sale) on the market!Again, I did a lot of comparison research when deciding on which camera to purchase, so comment if you have any questions about this product!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Depends on what your looking for.", "Author": "babyx", "ReviewID": "R2NEWOKKXL542C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought one a little over one month ago with the full understanding that some people had found the camera to freeze up from time to time.A neat audio video recorder, however, with this camera, everything must be viewed under the light of the extreme zoom feature.

This is a camera in which everything is OK and you get a great zoom.As for the freeze issue.  I had thought before the purchase that the freeze issue was a result of this zoom feature.  For me at least this seems to be true.  Yes it freezes all the time which could be really annoying, but, all one has to do is give the slightest assist to the largest lens ring as you turn it on, just the slightest tug to get it to full extension, and you will see the little green light around the power button go off, and the camera will be ready to use.Some may have a different set of circumstances, but for me, this is the only ill behavior this camera produces that I have found.

All digital cameras that auto focus need a second or two to catch the image and focus the camera to produce the best results. Once the camera has the image focused, most cameras will continue the same shot over and over. This camera is no different. Don't buy a high quality Nikon digital camera if you do not know how to use one. Buy a Kodak or a lower end model from Nikon as they are usually designed for the novice photographer. All of the web sites that reviewed this camera, rate it very high and I agree with those ratings thus far.Yes it will produce some blurr in some photos depending on light. Other then that it will produce great photos. You will get a red square if the photo does not focus correctly and this seeme to be related soley on light conditions and/or the settings. You can compensate for light conditions.

Well, maybe I got lucky, but mine has been an excellent camera.  I've had it for over a year now and it is a significant upgrade over my old Samsung 7mp camera and better than any other point and shoot that I've used (though I consider this a bit more than a point and shoot).  I liked it so much that I recommended my little sister to order one, which she did, in the red color.  Her's has had a few issues, but I blame that on her not taking care of it (sounds like there's sand in the lens unit, and it's scratched and banged to heck) and not reading the manual (so she doesn't get the best photos she could).  As for mine, it has given me thousands of crisp, clear, wide angle and high-zoom photos.  There have been times when it would freeze and I would need to take the battery out to get it to reset...this has happened maybe 2 or 3 times.  When the battery gets low, the screen turns off as the flash recharges, but I rarely use the flash so that's not much of an issue, and it's fixed by putting in a new battery.  And, when I zoom in more than about 10x, and if the subject I'm focusing on is against a light background (imagine focusing on the moon while it's in the daytime sky) then there is a circular artifact thing just off-center...it seems like the lenses may create some sort of halo thing as they zoom in on things.  If the background isn't a solid light color then you can't notice this, but at times it's a minor annoyance.  Other than that, I couldn't be happier with this camera; I use it a lot, I have a young daughter who is a common subject for me, and any time I go for a hike or visit someplace or anything like that, I use my camera, and it has yet to let me down.  And the images are really nice, and I use mostly the auto setting!  Though I do tweak the settings to my liking (exposure and color tint and all that...really though, the camera does everything).  The high zoom creates very crisp pictures, the autofocus works very well (except when you try to get too close to subjects while in \"Macro\" mode...), low light shooting is perfectly acceptable, the flash is powerful, the scene settings are good, the video is decent, the viewing screen is really nice, the controls are simple and useful, the camera itself looks nice, and I mean 18x optical zoom...that's hard to beat.

I bought it based on excellent reviews in Amazon and Nikon's reputation as camera manufacturer. I also owned a Nikon D5000 - bought it new from Amazon last year. It is an excellent camera to say the least. I bought S9100 because I need something small to take during my many business trips - if the destination is interesting of course.Several comments in Amazon were really negative about this camera. And I agree 100% with the other reviewers that the fault is usually with people who are not familiar operating the camera.In my first few tries under poor lighting and maximum zoom, I did get blurry (out of focus) pictures. I noticed the blurriness is due to movement, not out of focus. At first I thought the vibration-reduction was not activated, but it was. BTW I am not a pro in photography.After tinkering with the ISO setting, I was able to take very sharp pictures under poor lighting and maximum zoom. Voila, this is a really nice camera.For those who cannot get good focus, try to set the ISO to around 1600. This will take care of your problem with \"blurry\" pictures.Overall I am very happy with my purchase. It is slightly bigger than my old Canon (the battery cover just gave up only after 2 years), but the S9100 packs more features such as 18X zoom, 14mm wide angle, and 1080p HD video.

The reviews were mixed, but I really like the vivid colors in pictures made by Nikon cameras.  The problem with the camera failing to focus properly on auto setting (as discussed by other reviewers) was there for me as well.  The focusing is especially poor in close ups, so you have to resign yourself to only a fraction of the shots being in proper focus.  Still, the shots that were in focus were great -- full of color and detail.  The stabilization system that is supposed to work in low light is a lot less efficient than its equivalent in cheaper and earlier models of Canons.  Almost all the shots that I made without a tripod were blurry, so the system can't really be relied on.Seven months into ownership dark spots appeared on photos and LCD screen.  Disappointed, I sent the camera to be repaired.  After two weeks, finally received an estimate for $100 and Nikon's refusal to cover it under warranty.  Two more weeks trying to get an explanation from someone in the repair department.  The customer service was outrageous.  Seriously, even the \"supervisor\" failed to honor the promises to respond in \"24-48 hours.\"  Finally was informed that the problem -- never clearly identified -- was caused by an \"impact.\"  The camera had light use, never suffered an impact, and was never exposed to strenuous environments.  The third time I had a problem with a Nikon product over the past five years; the second time I had an outrageous experience with their repair department.  None of the positive features of the camera are outweighed by the unreliability and the repair record and procedures.  Would rather put the repair costs toward a Canon product.  Had to carry a cheap, six-year-old Canon point-and-shoot as backup for the Nikon S9100 and was glad that I had it.  Sad demise of a company that used to have great products.

I bought the Nikon S9100 with high hopes; the reviews were good, and I really wanted this one to be \"the one\". I had tried several cameras before this one; they all suffered from soft corners and other issues that made them impossible to live with. Initially it seemed to be working out - White balance and exposure looked very accurate, and the camera was easy to use. The photos on the 3\" screen looked OK; sharpness in the corners was not ideal but at least it wasn't nearly as bad as the awful Fuji F505/550 EXR.HOWEVER..... once I got the photos into my computer, and started looking at them on a 24\" monitor - they were all cr@p. No other word for it - I WASTED several days of shots, about 400 photos - almost nothing was useable. Focus was behind or in front of the subject; I had to check whether IS was on because everything was blurred even in good outdoor light. The dumb camera had chosen ISO 1600 for pretty much everything, and was choosing shutter speeds like 1/10, which it clearly could not handle. Noise reduction was so strong that I couldn't see a strand of hair; everyone looked like they were wearing plastic helmets like Lego characters. Panorama mode was poorly implemented, there were significant artifacts (ie, errors) in most. Videos were poor, IS was ineffective at all focal lengths.Overall, a very disappointing camera. I had high hopes, based on the reviews at DPReview and Snapsort - but I just can't reconcile the very poor photos I saw with their good reviews.

It's been back to NIKON for repair twice already, and I am about to send it for a third time. The outdoor pictures are OK although not as sharp as I would expect. The problem is mainly with indoor shots. Very often the pictures come out blurry. Even the slightest movement of the object can cause blurriness. Also, very often the pictures come out washed out when a flash is used. What I noticed is that the camera uses very slow speed shooting inside 1/30 which in my mind is the main reason for the blurry pictures. The problem with washing out I think is caused when all of a sudden the camera decides a high ISO needs to be used. The worst is you never know when it is going to misbehave. You can take several pictures one after another of the same subject in the same position and sometimes they may come out OK and then all of a sudden become blurry or washed out. Every time I send it back for repair, NIKON says they changed parts and the camera is fixed. It's been 3 weeks since the last repair and I already have a bunch of ruined pictures on different occasions. I am about to send it back to NIKON for a third time. The last time I asked them to just send me a new camera but they refused and said they were going to fix this one. At this point I am doubtful they are capable of repairing it.

Badon", "ReviewID": "R30LB5JEJVHPQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I rated this camera a \"3\". It is harder to review than that. First I will state this camera was built very well. The quality and design was dead on. It was one of the easiest cameras to use and had functions that made a Point-and-Shoot camera one would love to own. I have never owned a Nikon but will say I really can respect the Tech and quality in design. I gave this camera a \"5\" in that regards. So here is why the rating was lower. This camera only took pictures that looked like an amateur using a manual camera would take. This is an automatic. I ran this camera through the paces several times. I also read the manual and reviewed as much info and feedback as possible about it. This camera gives pictures that most are calling Blurry. They are not blurred !!  They are FLAT!!!  They lack crisp edges and are not vibrant. They are also reddish!!!  For an automatic camera, it was not so easy to use.This is why I think this Camera should get a \"1\" in picture quality. The camera had reviews that bounced around telling you the flaws with the camera but the incredible speed, quality of design, and the Nikon name kept them from bashing it. I also had the same issues. I returned this camera after about 2000 pictures and bought a Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FH25. The quality and vibrance of the pictures was incredible. This is what one should expect in a point-and-shoot. It did not have the super zoom or 10 optical but sure gave me pictures of what I saw and that matters. The Nikon just failed. It isn't user error. People rating this Nikon camera poorly have good reason to. My mom bought the Nikon Coolpix with 8 optical and she complained about the reddish pictures!!  I just told her to return it. She had issues right out of the box. Same as me. The pictures look faded and flat like the color pictures in an old 1970's magazine. Nice effect if you are trying to get that. It might sound crazy but I almost kept this camera!!!  If money wasn't an issue I would of kept it to get effects and pictures it would produce. I returned it to the local store I got it from and hunted down the LUMIX. Which took great pictures. I needed a pocket camera for Disney World and wanted to leave my larger camera behind. I am not brand loyal. I am more interested in the output of the picture and how consistent the camera can achieve it. This Nikon failed to give the same picture twice in a row!!!  The duplicate shots had people asking if I changed settings or augmented the photos. I am advising you to not buy the camera unless you are a professional who is looking for a camera to get cool effects and different results. This is coming from someone who gets told their photos look like post cards. I am no professional but do try to get crisp vibrant shots. Rich color matters. This Nikon will not do that. Look at the sample photos online. You will see that none will look like incredible shots. They will look common and plain.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWFUL!

After buying it, I looked at many user reviews and too many were negative, but I decided to give the camera a try anyway.  It looked good and I wanted it to be my next camera.  Sure enough, after one month's use, the lens locked in an extended position, much like others warned.  Removing the battery corrected the problem, but I then worried about when it would happen again.  I guess I could have lived with that, but even after studying the user manual, which I had to print from the supplied CD, I never could get consistently focused pictures.  I read the user blogs and tried the techniques they suggested to get consistently proper focused photos and nothing worked.  If this is supposed to be a point and shoot camera, I expect it to get me shots without a lot of muss and fuss, and this camera won't do that. The last straw was this past weekend in a church at my grandson's christening.  I decided to shoot on the Scene setting, where supposedly the camera will decide which scene mode it should use based on its analysis of the setting.  Well, I shot several photos, most of which can never be duplicated again, and I got a smattering of results.  Sometimes the flash went off, other times it did not, even with identical lighting conditions.  Some shots were good, but others were simply out of focus and others had a very orange-red tinge.  All I did was point and shoot and I got all kinds of results, too many of which were totally unacceptable.  Thank goodness I had the foresight of asking my wife to use my old Canon PowerShot SD700 also, and between us we got enough good pictures of this event.  The seven year old Canon had no trouble with the lighting conditions, but the S9100 could never figure them out.  That convinced me that I would try to return this camera. Thank goodness for Costco.  90 day return policy with no quibbles.  They simply described the reason for the return being the purchaser's displeasure with the photo quality.  You can say that again.  I've never owned a camera that was so incapable of point and shoot photography.  Like others have said, you need to stay away from this camera.

Vane \"engineerdude\"", "ReviewID": "R1KLS6Z0E5SHR2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This travel zoom camera is most comparable to the Panasonic ZS8/10, Canon SX230 HS, and Sony HX9.  I did not consider the other similar cameras from Fuji, Pentax or Samsung when looking at what to purchase.  After reading reviews on dpreview.com, imagingresource.com and other sites and looking at comparison shots, I settled on the Nikon S9100.  Pricewise, it was in the middle of the pack with the Panasonic cheaper, the Canon comparable and the Sony more expensive.  I have used Panasonic cameras in the past (FZ18 and FH-20) and thought I'd try a different manufacturer.The 3 main problems discussed in the reviews of the S9100 from various web sites were 1) the zoom sticks open after some period of time and will not retract 2) there is a problem focusing at higher zooms and 3) the little cover does not close all the way when powering down the camera.  I have not had any problems with #1 as this does not seem to affect all cameras based on reviews but just a few isolated ones.  I have had some challenge focusing at higher zooms (#2).  I've solved this by powering down and back on the camera.  I think the \"intelligence\" of the camera tries to remember past focus points and adjust.  This has only happened a few times and restarting the camera did the trick both times.  Of the 20+ times I powered down the camera, the small lens cover stuck once or twice. A simple tap of my finger and it closed.This camera has a lot of features and scene modes.  Plus, while there is no manual focus, there are other manual settings like white balance, saturation, tinting, etc.  I find the manual focus of using buttons kind of strange in other similar cameras.  These features are great for the somewhat serious amateur photographer.  There is a lot packed into this camera.  I also truly enjoy the 18x zoom lens which exceeds the others, the sturdy build of the body, the quick startup, burst mode, and other features including an intelligent scene mode for those of us who don't want to think when shooting.  The size is a bit heavier and bulkier than my smaller cheaper 8x zoom camera but the feel is sturdy and higher quality.  I haven't tried the video yet.  I hope this camera lasts me a long time.  There is still room for improvement so I'm giving it 4 stars.1/4/12 Update:  I took it out for some planespotting and picture taking in the blue skies.  The photos show that there is vignetting issues at the edges.  Not sure if this is localized to my camera or a problem with all S9100's.  This showed up mostly at extreme zoom.  I'll have to take comparison shots.  Its not all that bad but perhaps shooting in the direct sunlight made the vignetting worse.  The camera still takes great pictures.  I shot mostly in manual mode with saturation up a notch (called clarity), white balance on sunlight, and exposure toned down a bit.  Battery life seems fine although I've purchased a cheap backup battery and charger port (the camera doesn't come with an external charger).*******UPDATE**********July 10, 2012Updating my review after 6 months usage.There seems to be some fringing on the edges that most reviews didn't notice, especially at zoomed in resolution.I had the camera on my wrist and it banged into something while I was carrying it.  No problems until 2 months later when the flash stopped working.  Sent it in for work and Nikon said there was impact damage, even though the flash worked for several months.  I'm disappointed that any visible marks on the camera have voided the warranty, especially after I purchased an extended warranty.  I suspect that if anything else stops working on it they'll blame it on the impact damage.  The service people were cold and wanted to charge me 1/2 the cost fo the camera to fix it.  I likely won't buy from Nikon again and this was my first purchase.  I have figured out how to use it but the manufacturer does not make these things to last very long, perhaps only long enough until the next version comes out.  Oh well.I won't buy from Nikon again unfortunately.*******UPDATE**********November 2013OK, so I've had the camera about 2 years now.  Image quality was maintained but dust appeared inside the lens between the lenses.  A quick shake managed to get it to drop but it does appear from time to time.  But, now the LCD powers on but there is no picture.  As I mentioned above, expect to get about 2 years out of this camera. With the S9300 and S9500 coming out I guess Nikon expects you to only need this for a year before upgrading.  Still disappointed and now I have a camera that's only good for parts.Mfr warranty was useless since they claim I dropped the camera (even though I didn't).  Still won't buy a Nikon again unfortunately and I've told all my friends this too. Successfully convinced a good friend to buy another brand so he wouldn't waste his money on a different Nikon.

Or maybe you think that I'm ignorant in mathematics? Not necessarily. It's simply that the Nikon Coolpix S8000 that I've been using for the past two years, yields great images in terms of resolution, contrast, color saturation etc. I put the two cameras to the test side-by-side and the 9100's images were noticeably soft compared to the S8000, while the colors looked dull even after I enhanced the \"vividness\" menue. I plan to sell it at a loss rather than keep a white elephant in my closet. With such products, Nikon is shooting itself in the leg. And you are hearing this from a Nikon man. From what I gleaned from other tech-savvy reviewers of various other makes and manufactueres, I gather that when you increase a camera's zoom reach as is the case with the 9100, you need to upgrade the sensor; if not, the pictures will come out grainy. In order to remedy this, the camera's program will \"soften\" the images. Result: the pictures will look out-of-focus.  Perhaps Nikon needed to upgrade the sensor for such a powerful zoom to solve the problem. But no camera programmer am I. Suffice it to say that Nikon users expect more, much more from this manufacturer who used to be known in the past for reliability and quality products. At any rate, glad that I've kept my S8000.

When I was deciding this purchase I was expecting our first baby so I needed some very responsive camera. As I and my wife use this camera, we noticed several annoying features as other reviewer mentioned. When you just take a picture the edges are all warped. If people are standing on the edge the head or body become strange. If the building is the object then it gets distorted. It doesn't focus when you zoom in. Sometimes the pictures get blurry. I did not want to give up on this camera and I tried to use different features for different situations. My conclusion and compromise are zoom in a little bit before you take and use scene mode and chose Portrait then you don't have the issues I mentioned above. This camera has interesting functions similar to Sony cyber shots or canon's powershot. I still like this camera and using Portrait mode I have been taking better pictures constantly now. As a product this Portrait mode should be the default setting though.Another good side of this camera is that it takes really nice Full HD 1080p video.And the battery lasts really long.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't focus in low light", "Author": "nocalalan", "ReviewID": "R1IRVOAS21RBIX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered this camera specifically because of improved low light abilities over Panasonic ZS7.

It lets you reach way out there for a shot and nearly locks the scene in place when you depress the shutter button to shoot. I am sure if I had a tripod available it would have been close to perfect.  I got this camera too close to vacation time to really play with it much but hope to rectify that in the coming months.

I have put it through the gammit of uses, outdoors with lots of light, outdoors with no light.  Indoors with and without flash.  I will say the pictures have only got better as I have learned how to use the camera as it is a bit quirky out of the box.  At first I found it to have some blurriness to it, when I would zoom in, say on my daughter.  But I did not have the flash on at all, and I was trying to take pictures rapidly.  I now use it with the flash more often in these situations, and the pictures are gorgeous.  I try not to Zoom it in to much, digital zoom is off on the camera, as I set it.The flash is in an awkward place, but it is slim enough that is does not bother or interfere with my shots.  I do find that the pictures are of a much crisper quality when the flash is on.The manual functions on the camera are deep!  I have not dived into them to much, because I have not had to, and I own a SLR for those shots.  but when you want to play with it, it is quite good.If I was to give any negatives, and I need to think here, I guess it would be its inability to zoom in to far.  Now this is mainly because of my hand shaking, BUT when I actually put the picture on my computer and printed it, the picture was gorgeous.  I thought it was a ruined shot, but it was of a large lakes island, about 1/2 a mile away I would say, and the photo was so darn detailed and pretty, I was blown away.Lightweight, Small, 18x optical zoom(which blew my mind).  The cameras a great deal. at $299-$330 it is nice.I suggest this to anyone who like to take pictures, even if they are just messing around, the camera, toy, is just amazing!!Thanks!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK so I will keep it simple, and if you want to go in depth with me just respond.  This camera is fairly new to market, and I found it and had to have it after all my research.  It beat out the Panasonic's, Sony's and Canons.  Reason is the CMOS sensor.  It makes it smooth and process pics and movies nice. As for the camera, lightweight, takes amazing photos in auto, so far not many opportunities for manual.Cool special effects, like removing color and having a black and white picture with say just the green showing.  Cook for outdoor photos ya know.One knock but not to bad is flash location. I have very large hands, and the flash has to go somewhere, and its placement does not both my hand position.  I can see it being annoying, to some, but I do not have an issue.All in all, great for the dollar!  How can you go wrong with a 18X optical zoom.  I turn off digital zoom on all my cameras, because it never works (but in this camera you have the option to crop a digital zoom pic.)Enjoy, and if you have any questions, ask me, I will try to figure it out for you, but I think it is an amazing camera, and for the price, home run!Cases, I bought a TBC-304 and it is way to big.

There is a small bubble near the center of every photo in every zoom range.  Cleaning the lens did not fix this, so it could either be a defect in the lens glass or the sensor itself.2.  Auto-focus is very poor in Auto mode, as has been mentioned in many other reviews.  In order to get good focus, one of the Scene modes must be used.Update 2/29/2012:I was able to exchange instead of returning.  The replacement camera had the same issues - a small lens bubble, albeit in a different spot, and poor focus.  I even went to a local store and looked at their display model - same problems.  The bubble was in yet a different spot, but it was there.  None of the other Nikon models in the store had these problems.I even contacted Nikon's tech support.  Worthless!

Before I purchased I read many reviews and yes, there were a few bad reviews, but I thot really nothing of it. Most were good. So I bought the camera and put it through its paces; extensively, for a couple of months. Well I can tell you now, after I returned the S9100 (twice), that all the bad reviews are pretty much dead-on, especially about focusing and lens lock-up. The biggest and main complaint I have is that: all the features and great specs on the camera will not do you any good at all if the camera can not even consistently auto-focus. Very, very disappointing to download the pictures on your computer and find out that over half of them are out-of-focus ! Not one time, not two, but over and over again. VERY inconsistent and disappointing. I even tried to focus to forefront solid objects but to no avail. Still out of focus. Even when the focus set ( depressing the shutter release half-way down ) showed the objects in focus, they still downloaded out of focus. I even returned the first S9100 I got a second one, in hopes that it was a fluke thing. But no, the second camera did the very same thing. No consistent auto-focusing. I had always expected better of Nikon, since I own four Nikon SLR's. HOWEVER, Nikon apparently still has some very big things to work-out on their P&S; cameras, especially the S9100. They need to perfect auto-focusing !The other issue, which you can work-around (but should not have to ) is that the lens will lock-up. I mean just plain will not move from close-up to telephoto or vice versa. The work-around is simply that you have to turn the camera off. Then the lens will retract. A very big nuisance to say the least but at least solve-able. However, the lack of  consistent auto-focusing is a much bigger issue and is totally unacceptable for any camera at any price. Period.If you buy this Nikon S9100 camera anyway after reading this review, make sure you get the extended, and I mean extended warranty. You are going to need it.I will say this about Amazon. They took the cameras back, both times, Nikon COOLPIX S9100 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 18x NIKKOR ED Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black)without any problem and really no issues whatsoever.

Using a 4 gig sd card is enough for a day, only. Guess what, when the card is full it then corrupts! All photos gone! Card unusable until you reformat it. Card reader in computer doesn't recognize it either. The battery has a meter and the only way you can check the cards memory is with the computer. My canon tells me card full, but, doesn't corrupt the card like this Nikon. If you are sold on all the bells and whistles of this camera get large cards and download often.The other point about this Nikon was the noise made when the camera was turned on. You also hear it when the zoom is operated. It lacks the smooth operation my last Nikon had and I waited for it to lock up any time.

I will be brief and to the point.  The image quality of this camera is atrocious.  I've read the manual, other's reviews and attempted all varieties of settings and indoor images are always (and I mean always) blurred.  It's really infuriating.  What is perplexing, however, is that the video quality couldn't be better.  Indoor/outdoor, it doesn't matter, videos are crisp, sound is clear, and always exceed my expectations.  My recommendation.....look elsewhere for a camera/video camera combo.  1 star for image quality, 4 star for video quality....I give an overall 2 star for ruining family photos/memories.Update to 1 star:  The POS froze up while we were on vacation.

The 18 power zoom is great if you want to take sports pictures. Unfortunately my camera has trouble focusing.

My old Canon Powershot SD700IS took every picture crystal clear, no matter how fast I took the picture.  Also the flash in this camera is too powerful. You must back up about 20 feet or the flash overpowers everything in the picture - especially faces.

Small cameras are a compromise, and you have to consider where you want the quality and features versus the weight and size compromise to fall.  Me, I wanted more features and build-quality than the smallest and lightest available . . . although that's a drag sometimes.  Many cameras are the same \"under the skin\" these days (I have a Samsung that almost certainly is built on the same chassis), so the differentiators become mostly the lens and firmware.

Which I cannot say, due to the incredibly bad service help from Nikon. Denial in fact by them that there is a problem with this camera. In short, I bought the camera and took it on a 90 day trip abroad. I bought it on Amazon through Cameta Camera. It had stabilization and focus problems which I at first thought was my problem. It took some amazing still photos, but then a series would be out of focus. Night shots were nearly impossible to capture. I have essentially given up trying to take pictures with it as is completely unreliable.No matter the settings, many pictures(simple shots) are simply out of focus. I am a semi-professional photographer. After my return, I contacted Nikon spent 5 hours -- talking with their help on the phone, going through their incredibly bad web help site an then also through the test processes they asked me to try and downloading problem photos. In the end I got no help just denial -- they said reset the camera. And mysteriously, put up the flash!\" Neither of which had any effect. The lack of stabilization and or other problems robbed me of a vacation of photos!!! Nikon has been beyond unresponsive. I would not buy another Nikon product based on their service response alone. (They did send me a nifty Customer Survey very promptly, asking me to rate their service.) I have owned a Coolpix before (the first) and used a Nikon SLR as a journalist. These problems extend even to the download software process with their accompanying software. There seems to be some relationship between the 'bad' photos and the software installed on my Mac. All these problems occur with maddening random basis, depending on the various settings -- INCLUDING AUTO!I wanted to return the camera for a full refund, but Amazon replied that since 90 days had passed (while I was out of the country) their buyer guarantee did not apply. I even purchased an extended warranty, which now seems worthless. I have tried to solve this problem with Nikon. Now I am now trying to send the camera back to Nikon for a refund - not likely -- and seeking redress from the vender. Read the other negative reviews here and the problems become clear.

Note that for the most part, I carry a small camera in my bag every day and it goes everywhere I go for that unexpected nature or street shot. This camera was meant to be an upgrade for my Canon Elph SD1000 because of the Nikon's much higher zoom and wider angle. Unfortunately, in many but not all ways, the S9100 was a disappointment. I am by no means a professional or even an advanced amateur photographer. I do, however, feel that I have the ability to get the most out of these small cameras, hence my very non-technical review.Both the pros and cons of the S9100 come with caveats. Below are some thoughts on the Nikon S9100:First, I cannot comment on the video function since I never use it.Lots of cool artistic features including selective color and panorama (though poorly executed compared to SONY). Selective color works very well.Easy to use with fairly intuitive menus but no real manual controls.Powerful zoom but you'll need a tripod to get that extreme close-up.Nikon claims this is a low light gem. It is not. I took the S9100 to a small concert venue that had definite lighting issues and every shot was blurry. Even an ISO adjustment didn't do the trick. I brought out my iPhone 4 and every shot was sharp and perfectly exposed.Though technically not a \"pocket camera,\" the S9100 is small enough to slip into a travel bag or cargo pants pocket.Wide angle is one of the best in this class of camera.I compared the same shot in Photoshop Elements taken with my Canon SD100, the Nikon S9100 and the Lumix DMZ-ZS8 that I purchased to replace the Nikon. In clarity, the Lumix with its great glass came in first followed by the Canon. The Nikon was noticeably softer. However, color rendition was clearly better in the Nikon.I really wanted to like this camera. Nikon has created a camera series that has great potential. After extensively researching the S9100 and reading reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew there would be compromises. As it turned out, with a good amount of hands on time, there were too many mediocre results that made continuing to depend on it unacceptable and out of the question for getting the great shots that had made me so satisfied with my Canon (and now with the Lumix).", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unreliable", "Author": "Jim C", "ReviewID": "R1LXQFXO1P88MM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having read the reviews here I was reluctant to buy this camera.

Based on what I have read here and elsewhere I don't see how the focusing issue will be resolved and suspect that it will only be a matter of time before it fails mechanically again.

I already own a Canon PowerShot SD4000IS 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Zoom and f/2.0 Lens (Red), which takes fine photos, but my wife wanted a camera with longer zoom. This camera was intended to replace the Canon. I used the Nikon for about a week and wound up returning it. Here is a little more detail about my experience with this camera:- The camera is bigger than most point-and-shoots I've tried, probably due to the larger screen. I needed to step up to a larger case than the one I currently use for the Canon.- Despite the size, there's no grip for your left hand to make it easy to hold. I notice many cameras in this class lack it, so no points deducted. However my left index finger naturally went to the top left corner, but since the flash resides there, I needed to find a different location.- The just-mentioned flash is manually operated, meaning the camera will tell you when it's needed but then you need to press the open button. If you happen to frame the perfect shot but it requires the flash, you need to pop it, refocus, and hope that the shot is still available.- There is no external charger -- you simply connect the power supply to the camera and the battery charges. That means you cannot charge one battery while using another.Now to the big reason why I returned it: all pictures looked pretty soft, even outdoors with sufficient light. In low-light interiors, which is where I take the majority of my photos, the quality was downright poor.

We looked at CNet reviews, and the S9100 seemed great, and after checking out other large optical zoom cameras, we thought we'd try a Nikon since I have many friends who rave about Nikon.  Well, I think we should have paid more attention to the Amazon user reviews.  People here kept stating that it was difficult to get a clean picture.  We figured we had plenty of experience and were good enough photographers to get past that.  Evidently we're not.  While we're not pros, we are pretty good.  We certainly know how to focus, center, and snap a good looking picture.  This camera just doesn't let you do that.  We fiddled with ISO settings, white balance, scene settings, pretty much everything until I was at the point where the camera was going to get thrown through a window and be unreturnable.  It's simply a frustrating camera.  You'll line up on your subject, half-click the shutter to focus, and it will grind until the moment is gone and not be able to focus.  This happens if you're 3\", 3', or 30' away.  Then you can tilt the angle just a smidge and it will focus.  It's maddening.  It performed horribly in low light, and if your hand wobbles the slightest bit, or if the cat or kid moves at all (when does a cat or kid NOT move when you are trying to take a picture?) the picture is totally ruined.  I'm not talking about huge movements...a kid moving an inch, or you hand wobbling just a little will wreak havoc on your shot.  Now, when it takes a good picture, it looks great.  In bright sunlight with the subject perfectly still, it looks great.  Unfortunately to get that one shot you'll shoot at least 5 others because something went wrong.

I LOVED this camera for the week that I had it except there were two issues I was unable to live with, 1-I think there was an issue with the dial, a few time I turned it to auto mode, but the camera would be in scene mode, it would take a few more back and forth rotation before it actually would get to the auto mode, a few time, the mode would be stuck in a mode for a few seconds, then the delay reaction of my rotations would show up on the LCD. 2-there may have been a speck of dust on the sensor because when I zoom in, you would see a blurred area that would not move when you move the camera.The s9100 has a backside illuminated CMOS sensor which was AWESOME in low light, there was never shutter lag, not even in a dim room, you press the shutter and it takes a picture right away, with no flash, I can seek each hair on a head when zoomed in. Sadly reading the reviews showed that it had many issues and I didn't want to risk getting another dud through Nikon warranty or even a exchange at target.

I've read many of the reviews for this camera and it seems a number of people have had problems with it, so I was somewhat hesitant about getting it. I ultimately decided to go with the majority opinion and purchased it and I must say I'm glad I did. I needed a good, simple (no manual settings) P&S; for those occasions where I did not want to take my bulky (and heavy) Nikon DSLR such as the playground, family get-togethers, impromptu trips, etc. The S9100 takes remarkably sharp, vibrant, color-rich photos greatly aided by a large, bright display panel with accurate color rendition. To top it all off, it has a very powerful zoom lens - very uncommon for a camera of this size and price range. I conducted a side-by-side comparison of the S9100 and the Sony P200 and the differences were like night and day. The S9100's colors were extremely vibrant and true whereas the P200's were somewhat muted and a little off. The big differences between the two were when I used the flash or shot a subject under fluorescent lighting.  When I used the flash, I noticed the Sony had a tendency to either wash out the subject - most of the images were super bright, or if the subject was somewhat distant, provided a very dark image as the flash range is not very good. The S9100 in some cases did not even require the use of flash - when it did, its images were simply stunning - very sharp, vibrant, well detailed with excellent saturation levels and good range. When I shot the subjects under fluorescent lighting, the S9100 beat the pants off the P200. Whereas the P200's colors leaned towards a bluish/greenish tint, the S9100's colors were dead center spot-on. It's simply amazing at how well the S9100 records its images. The same can be said for the video mode; the colors are excellent - extremely sharp, vibrant and bright. It also records well in low-light situations. It has a full-size HDMI connector and for some reason, the A/V output connector is located on the bottom which will require the camera to be laid down in order to make the connection. FYI, the A/V connector is proprietary: it doesn't use the standard 3-ringed mini stereo connector widely used by many other cameras, so if you lose/break it, you're out of luck as you won't be able to swap out the connector with one you may have from another camera.

Purchased at Fred Meyer for $250, the model on display didn't have power, so we were unable to test it (which should have been a hint), but the salesman was convincing.  We'd bought electronics from him before and had always been happy.  I was severely disappointed.  What I wanted (and I explained this to him clearly) was a camera that could not only zoom in on images in the distance, but also was able to zoom in (I learned this is called macro-zoom) close enough to get details cleanly.  Nikon has a recognizable name, and with his persuasion regarding the camera's abilities, I bought it untested.  I wish I had posted sample pictures of the zooming/macro-zooming before I returned it.  It was disappointing.  The traditional zoom wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't worth writing home about, and the macro-zoom was a joke.  I couldn't get any closer/clearer with the macro than I could with just the standard point and shoot/automatic feature.  In fact, every time I attempted to get a close-up, things became blurry, even after attempting to refocus.  Oh!  That's another thing!  It has an annoying delay when attempting to take pictures.  With other digital cameras, when you depress the \"take picture\" button, there's a hesitancy as this is also the focus button, however with this one, there is that delay and an additional delay, so taking pictures of objects that are moving, you know, like people or pets, produces a blurred vision.  It was all very frustrating, even after reading the manual and attempting to play with it some more.  I returned it and was told by a different rep. that she had the exact same problems with the one she had purchased (which she also returned).  She thought it might have just been a glitch with her camera, but after comparing notes, we both came to the conclusion Nikon attempted to put too many features in too small a camera.

With a LOT of effort I managed to get 50% in focus, this is dreadful on such a high end point and shoot.- Nikon CMOS not good in low lightI was under the impression the CMOS sensor would be a significant step up from my 3+ year old Panasonic TZ5.  All low light photos are awful, 100% failure, no matter the mode.  I was taking 4-6 of every indoor shot attempting in vein to get something decent.  Large amounts of grain, even on 12MP highest quality they look like JPGs set at 70% compression, really really bad.- The unit comes with no charger as well!  I had to pay $15 extra to get a charger.- Thumb video button isn't practicalI take tons of videos on my other digital cameras (I carry my Canon SD780 everywhere), so I thought a dedicated button for the video was a great idea.  It isn't.  Think about it for a second & try it on an existing camera if you have one.  I hold the camera with my right thumb and fingers, so to move my thumb I have to let go of my grip.  This meant in reality two things happened- I had to grab the camera with my other hand, allowing my thumb to move to stop or start a video- The last 5 seconds of the video was swaying all over the place as I attempted to move my thumbThe good ?  At high zoom, in very bright sunshine it's better than my 10x zoom TZ5.Avoid this product and think very carefully about the Nikon 9300 as it has a near identical thumb video button setup.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Faulty camera?", "Author": "CMK", "ReviewID": "R2ISDN8P3KEKMA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my camera yesterday with great anticipation.

Since then I had to send the first one back to you (Amazon) because I couldn't take the pictures off and you sent me a new one. When I got that one I could take the pictures off once, then again, couldn't take the pictures off and also the camera wouldn't take a charge. My husband called you (Amazon) and you told him this time he would have to send it to the Nikon company to be repaired.The Nikon company has had my camera since 4/19/12 and every time my husband or I call to find out the status on it they keep telling us they are waiting for an answer about the part that has nothing to do with the problem I sent it out for. They told my husband that they are waiting for a new lens. I called on 6/5/12 between 5:00 and 5:30PM, I asked him again what was going on with my camera and he told me he was waiting on an answer about the part and that it was from Japan. I then asked him to talk to a manager or supervisor. He transferd me to Edgar, a supervisor. I told him they had my camera for over 1 1/2 months, but in ten days it will be 2 months. He told me he is still waiting for them to call about the part. Then I asked why it was taking so long and he told me he didn't know. I told him I missed out on a lot of My granchildren's school functions, concerts, parades, science fairs, field days, just to name a few. I have my grandson's graduation this month, two granddaughters recitals and gymnastic classes. All I keep getting is, I am sorry but there isn't anything they can do but wait. I asked if I can get my warranty extended and he said that was a good question. I thought by buying Nikon that I was getting a good camera, but apparantly not. Edgar told me to give him 24 more hours and he would call them again and try to get me an answer. I called him in 24 hrs and he told me he said 24 to 48 hrs. I told him ok I will wait for his call, he never called me back yesterday so I called at about 10:50 Am this morning and asked to talk to Edgar and the woman told me he was doing something and he would call me back in 30 to 45 minutes and I told her he wouldn't call because he never called me the day before but I would wait.

On this 2nd occasion, Nikon sent me pics of damage they found on my lens barrel, which I wrongly thought didn't exist when I sent the camera to them.  I'd indicated my suspicions to their phone rep., and have apologized to them in writing as I now honestly recall causing this damage.  However, my camera did not fail when the visible damage occurred, and customer service is sorely lacking!  The failure occurred later and was associated with the lens meeting light resistance against a window while I operated the zoom.  I believe, given two experiences of my own and the many other internet findable \"lens error\" complaints which cause this camera to be unusable until serviced, that this camera is far too sensitive to total failure due to even the slightest resistance against lens extension when operating the zoom. As for the poor service I mentioned, I have to report that Nikon failed to notify me of their change of service status from covered under warranty to not covered (definitely caused a delay in getting my camera returned to me as they won't work on it until charges are approved, but they indicated there would be no charges, then left me unaware they had changed their mind while sitting on my camera doing nothing).  I've written to them of all my concerns on Sunday the 22nd of Jan., and they actually responded Sunday, with an obviously personalized \"thank-you\" note indicating that they will be considering all I've said, and re-evaluating my case.  More later....Jan 24th, 2012:  My case has been re-evaluated!  In lieu of re-writing all the detail that once was here, I offer the following note I sent to Nikon concerning my repair.  Mind you, I do love this camera when it works.  Keeping my fingers CROSSED however:\"Thank-you for the re-evaluation and 25% discount, resulting I can only GUESS from the failure to notify me of the change in my repair status from free to a charge, which caused an unnecessary delay in the repair process.  I have approved the repair.I do think I'm right to feel the discount is inadequate, and that Nikon is wrong to fail to adequately address the issue of what I'm necessarily left to believe is the extreme sensitivity of your lens systems to even light resistance against extension, often causing immediate total camera failure.  Nikon is aware that the nick seen on my lens did not cause the lens error failure, and you have not confirmed nor denied the suspicion I offered that the nick COULD have made the lens more sensitive to a light tap on glass much later.  I believe this is because Nikon knows that the light tap on glass likely would/could easily cause this lens error failure in any event, all by itself.  I believe Nikon probably understands that a moderate glancing sideways blow against a table (no fall) such as caused the nick on my lens barrel, easily could leave the camera functioning properly, as I've informed you was indeed the case.  I suspect Nikon is between a developmental rock (egg shell?) and a sales hard place with this issue, is denying too many warranty repairs as a result, and is being harmed by its choice to sell some of these coolpix models at all.  My warranty extends another 2.5 years, I've had too much downtime as a result of two repairs already, and hopefully should I get another lens error failure, you'll be unable to find anything to blame it on, as was the case in the first instance this camera failed and you fixed it free.  I suppose I should take photos of my camera to document its condition and functionality on a regular basis.I'm left feeling confident Nikon is well aware of and unwilling to suffer the consequences of the fact that it is an unacceptably weak design rather than unreasonable user abuse which is causing the vast bulk of these lens error failures.  After all, again, I KNOW the impact nick seen on my camera did not cause a failure, but rather, in both instances my S-9100 has failed (only one covered by you under warranty), minor resistance against lens extension - which itself caused no visible damage at all either time - was surely the culprit!  It really is unacceptable to be selling such fragile cameras, in my opinion (and certainly not without a stern and specific warning concerning this weakness).Thanks again for the 25% discount just the same, I'm sure I'm not writing to anyone who really has the power to correct Nikons real problem here, so really, thanks for what you could do.\"So, there you go, warranty denied, discount offered and accepted!UPDATE 01/31/2012:  More DELAY of note (a week), all on Nikon!  Here is the gist of a note I sent to Nikon today (follow-up on their response to a note I sent yesterday wondering why the repair page itself didn't show any sign that my approved repair was proceeding), which should speak for itself:\"via Web 01/31/2012 02:43 PMATTN: Dear (NIKON), Per your note, I've accepted the re-estimate with the discount a 2ND TIME, this time via phone. So, per your special request I'm letting you know separately here of this fact, so that you can \"expedite\" my repair. Again, I've provided payment information via the phone this time, which you have today informed me for the FIRST TIME, is the ONLY way to do so, and THE INTERNET SYSTEM FAILED TO INFORM ME OF THIS APPARENT FACT EARLIER TOO!! INSTEAD, YOUR WEBSITE BOTH REFLECTED THE DISCOUNT YOU OFFERED AND ACCEPTED MY PAYMENT INFORMATION, A WEEK AGO!!!!!! UPON CHECKING IN THE MEANTIME TO SEE IF MY PAYMENT DIDN'T GO THROUGH FOR SOME REASON, YOUR INTERNET SYSTEM INFORMED ME THAT MY ESTIMATE/PAYMENT INFO WAS ALREADY ACCEPTED, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS!!!! Yes, of course I'm very angry to have LOST ANOTHER WEEK with my camera DUE TO the INCOMPETENCE of Nikon.May I suggest that in the future you do NOT write to customers in my position saying \"You MAY approve via our 800-number\" but instead say \"You MUST approve via our 800 number, as we will not get your information through the website acceptance form DESPITE the fact that your offered discount will be reflected on the estimate and acceptance pages, and our systems will both take your payment information and claim to have accepted it and your estimate approval\"I think THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE gross incompetence!, I must say! Especially after the delay I've already been through for the failure to inform me of the re-estimate to a charge in the first place! PLEASE pass all of this on to someone who just MIGHT have the authority and inclination to spend the money to fix the absolutely horrible procedures and software Nikon has in place for service functions. For what it's worth, If I were in your shoes, I'd be BEGGING for improvements to the systems at this point.\"There is no sign that I'll get any further discount on my repair for this week-long unnecessary delay of Nikon's doing.

The original Nikon F is still my favorite-- heavy and a loud click. But the Nikon Coolpix s9100 does not come with a printed.  Digital cameras are increasingly more complicated and its a lot of work to memorize everything and having the manual in a pocket has been very important to me.Instead its a pdf manual on a cd and guess what, mine was secured, could not print it out although even if I did I cannot carry around a bunch of letter size pages in my backpocket.I guess if I am somewhere and I want to take a photograph but it requires some special knowledge about the camera I will have to go back home, crank up the Mac, read the manual and  then go back to take the photograph.This might seem like a small thing, but over the past twenty years many MBAs have figured out the easiest way to create more profit is not by making a better product or better service but by taking  something away from the customer in product or service.  It  looks like Nikon is going that path and this will be the last Nikon I ever buy.I am adding this on April 16,  2012..The shutter button broke off. As I explained before I have been using NIkon cameras since the F which is still my favorite.I take REAL good care of my cameras, always in a container of some sort when not being used, not out in the rain, I always have a strap around my neck or my wrist, depending on what kind of camera. I own a D70 and a D80 as well as some other models  of the film F and other point and other Nikon point and shot. Nikon refuses to  fix it under warranty. They are saying its my fault. I am always careful of my cameras. What ever happened is the fault of Nikon.At this point my reply  to them is to \"Throw it in the garbage.  I will never buy another NIkon again. \"", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera at a great price", "Author": "Michael R.

Nothing went right with this camera.  First thing I noticed was it charges up the battery in the camera.  This means you need to tie up your camera just to charge up the battery.  The cable was fitted so that you can either charge it up on a USB port or connect it to a plug adapter.  Unwittingly I guess the plug was not all the way in so after 4 hours of charging I turned it on and noticed the batter was still low.  This makes the cable suspect in getting it to work.  Anyway I wanted to test it out a bit to see how it performs.  The first thing it ask you to do is to set the language.  Not reading the instructions I pressed the wrong button and it switched to a non English language and I did not know how to switch it back.  Luckily turning it off and on did not save that setting,  whew!!  Anyway I took the camera outside and took some pictures.  I noticed it took a long time after you take a flash picture.  I don't know if this is because the battery was low.  Anyway without warning the camera blanked out without even retracting the lens.  I could not turn it on anymore to retract the lens.  Luckily I was at home where I can charge it up but what if I was on the go, how can I put it in a case again with the lens open and zoomed out?  So I plugged it in to charge.  After a half hour it turned on automatically and retracted the lens.  So I let it charge up over night.  The next morning I turned it on and the when in the mode to take a picture, the display was entire black.  I could not see anything through the lens.  I could see menu options but not what the camera is aiming at.  For those who think I left the lens cap on it was not on.  In fact there is no lens cap.  I could plainly see the glass lens.  After turning it on and off, taking some pictures and noticing the pictures were black I decided to return it to Costco where I bought it.  This is the worse camera I ever owned.
