{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Faster/Cheaper/Better...", "Author": "\"yochin\"", "ReviewID": "R3HOWJ6X8H25HC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is faster than most digital cameras out there; from opening it to it turning on and being ready to shoot it takes about three seconds; from pressing the shutter button down to it taking a picture it takes almost one second (even faster if you've already pressed the shutter down half-way to focus and meter);  from it taking a full-size, best-quality 2 mega pixel shot to it being ready to take another it takes about three seconds (even faster with less quality or smaller sized pictures).  The camera controls on the back allow you to easily change to close-up mode or change white balance or add exposure compensation or turn off the flash or use the stitch-assist mode or the self-timer with from one button push for close-up mode to around four to six button pushes for the more complicated added features.  The lens is the equivalent of a 39mm f2.8 lens on a film-slr camera and it focuses very fast with an auto-focus mechanism that chooses the most likely subject among three focus squares in the middle of the viewfinder/lcd screen to focus on and it has an auto-focus assist beam that aids in focusing; speeding it up especially in scenes with slightly lower light levels.This camera is cheaper than many cameras out there.  It costs around [$$$]right now which is cheaper than most 2 megapixel cameras right now.  The material it's made out of is a  sticky plastic which feels grimy if you hold it too long while you're out in the sun because the sweat on your hands tends to smear all over it and generally yucks it up (just wipe it off with your shirt; it's no big deal).  This camera takes compact flash type 1 cards which are very easy to find and fairly reasonably priced for a good-sized card (if you already have a more expensive Digital camera that uses compact flash cards then obviously; you're in luck!).  The batteries that it uses are two double A's; rechargeable or alkalines (very-very easy to find; just go down to your local [store]to find the nickel metal hydride rechargeable kinds).  If you don't have a compact flash card reader but you do have a usb port then you can transfer the images right off of the camera and straight into your computer (Mac or PC).  If you don't have a computer then you can still use the camera; just buy one of Canon's two available dye-sublimation printers and you can print pictures from 6X4inches to smaller than a postage stamp and almost every size in between to your heart's content.Is this camera better than most cameras out there?  One argument against it is it doesn't have an optical zoom; but truthfully having a zoom lens doesn't necessarily mean your pictures are automatically going to be better; for example instead of zooming in and taking a \"stalker\" picture of that cutey down the hall why don't you just walk up to that cutey and say smile! and take that cutey's picture from up close and then engage that cutey in an actual conversation; believe me your picture quality will improve dramatically!  Another argument against this camera is that it only has two megapixels; but truthfully for snap-shot sized pictures or smaller including pictures that you're going to be using on the web you don't need that extra one or two megapixels over the first two megapixels; it's just pixel overkill for a picture of your uncle holding up that trout he just wrestled into his net or extreme close-ups of your baby doing everything from sleeping peacefully in the crib to crying red-faced while you're giving her another bath or changing her diaper for like the hundreth time.  A third argument against it is that compared to a comparable camera such as the[$$$]it is made of cheaper materials and it's much bulkier; but truthfully many people find those smaller elf-like cameras clunkier; they're slower to turn on they're slower to extend their lens; they're heavier; they're more expensive; they're less responsive to the user when their shutter buttons are pushed; they use more expensive proprietary batteries; they give people with bigger hands or arthritis carpal tunnel syndrome and the list goes on...Is this camera better than any other camera out there I ask again?  Well obviously the simple truth answer is no; you can always buy a more expensive camera and get more pixels or longer lenses or interchangeble lenses and flash-shoes and doodads to your heart's content so a more appropriate question to ask would be is this camera better than any other camera out there for the intended task that I seek it to do as a prospective camera buyer on the market?

Here's why:* The A40 has a more solid feel in your hand.  Instead of \"perching\" in your hand, it \"fits\" your hand.  (Look at the nice curve that fits into your right hand as you hold the camera.)* The A40 has an optical zoom, as well as the digital zoom that most digital cameras have.  The A200 only has a digital zoom; you lose some quality.* The controls on the A40 are easier to understand and better layed out.  The A40 has what you call a thumb wheel.  To switch between picture taking modes, or into photo review mode, you just spin the wheel.  No pressing the same button over-and-over.* Finally, it's easier to change the batteries on the A40!!  Why did Canon make the battery compartment so hard to open on a piece of equipment that needs its batteries changed daily or weekly??If you just need a bare-bones camera that takes great pictures, buy the A200.

The price is incredible for what you are getting, plus its cheap enough for a starter to get into digital photography without making a dent in the pocket book.Let me just summarize my pros and cons for this camera:Pros:- awesome price (I think this is a HUGE factor)- takes compact flash (these are typically cheaper than other types of memory)- takes 2 AA batteries (don't need special batteries)- 2 megapixels offers good quality photos- USB connection (you don't need a CF reader/writer)- lightweight- awesome effects such as b/w, moasic, vivid, movie modeOverall, its a great **starter** camera.  However, once you get comfortable you will probably want a better camera due to the limitations I will discuss now.Cons:- only digital zoom (the quality of the zoom is so terrible that its not worth using, specially indoors since the flash isn't strong enough to get you a picture)- battery door is flimsy (the battery door is very flimsy and it broke when I dropped the camera once)- exteremely vulnerable to impact (dropped the camera a total of about 2 ft and it stopped focusing properly... be very careful NOT to drop the camera)- automatic settings not good enough (I had to use the manual settings to get better quality pictures when indoors)- takes a while to encode image (specially when you have the file size set smaller.. it takes between 5 - 10 seconds to encode the image.  I'm thinking it compresses the image on the fly and that slows it down)Well, thats about it honestly.  One addition... invest in rechargable batteries and a charger, a pair of batteries lasts only a few hours specially when used indoors with the flash.Like I said, its a great starter camera but you will grow past it within 6 months.Hope this helps... please vote YES if it did I appreciate it.Khosrof", "Date": "February 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "good overall for the price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RBK9AUJE65JHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thicker than I expected, the specs said 1.3 in but I measured it and came to be close to 1.45 so feel bulky in hand and pocket.

In fact, this is the main reason I went with digital when I bought the S10 when it first came out. I remember everyone being surprised when the pictures just taken were displayed on the 32\" screen in living color. They asked me what it was and I said its DIGITAL. To this day, I am still amazed by the fact that the picture can be displayed instantly on your TV screen. That said, I bought the A200 for a relative. When I received the camera I found the camera is built solid and very slick with nice features.  We took some pictures and wanted to see how it turned out.  I looked for a video cable and none was to be found.  Then it had dawned on me that this camera does not have video-out. I thought to myself the price was too good to be true. Never did I imagine Canon would cut corners and leave out the most important feature.  Needless to say we were very disappointed. Without a video out you are limited to downloading the pictures to the computer and have everyone gather around the computer monitor to see the pictures. Even if you have a tv-out on the pc you have to hook up the cable, mess with settings, run the slideshow prog, etc.etc.. Just a big hassle either way. We ended up also buying the Sony DSC-P31 which is a very comparable camera for about few bucks more. I was really torn between the two but had initially gone for the A200 only because I've had good experiences with Canon. The Sony includes the video-out as well as the NIMH batteries plus the charger. By the time you get the charger and batteries for the Canon, it ends up being the same price. Video-out is not a lot to ask on a digital camera especially in this price range. I say this because the price on digicams have dropped dramatically since the days of the S10 and there is no excuse for a manufacturer to omit this very basic feature. I would not be surprised if Canon realizes their mistake and includes this feature on a later model in the same price range.  That said, if you never intend to display your picturs on TV, this is a great little camera.

I can't say enough how much I hated this camera! First of all, it has a digital zoom that might as well not be there. If you use it, the pictures come out all blurry. If you try to take photos without the zoom, the quality is okay... however, the camera takes forever to \"charge\" it's flash, or whatever it is doing, and it takes forever to take the photo. You have to hold the button down for almost 5 seconds before it will take - and by then whatever you wanted a photo of is gone! If you have pets or children that you want photos of, forget it. They move too fast for this camera. I highly recommend you get the Powershot A40 instead. I returned this camera and got the A40 and absolutely LOVE it! It has the optical zoom which does a great job (Key word here is OPTICAL zoom. Do not buy a camera without it!). It's fast and easy to use and even has great modes like black and white. Cannon really did a great job on this camera and all the problems that plagued the A200 are gone. And the photo quality is amazine.

Many cameras in this price range don't do nearly as well in terms of low light performance, color fidelity in incandescent lighting, or macro ability, plus having all those buttons on the back of the case is actually a lot easier than having to go through a bunch of on-screen menus.My two main misgivings about the camera are that I've gotten some aliasing of diagonal lines a few times (though they don't seem to be all that noticeable in the prints) and the focus assist beam never seems to help.  I guess I can live with the latter for the most part as I've figured out what focusing range the camera defaults to when it can't lock focus, about 8ft to infinity in normal mode and 4.25* inches in macro mode(*which is about the width of the camera, 4.3\").  The infinity mode also doesn't appear to have any effect from what I can tell.  How have other people's experiences run with the focus assist beam, infinity mode and aliasing?Lastly Canon's tech support hasn't been very good,  I don't need someone to read out of the user guide to me, but that's as much as they seem to do.  If I could get past that first level of tech support, things would probably be different. But really, I like the camera!  Oh yeah, the small size and light weight mean I can comfortably carry it in a shirt pocket.  Battery life with 1700mah Nimh is fine, though I rarely use the flash or the LCD.

It's a great camera that has provided 1000s of good looking 4X6 prints over the years. But, it's time to upgrade.Let me start by saying that I am not an ace photographer or anything. I'm just your basic point and shoot family picture taker kind of guy. So, please interpret my comments about the A200 in light of that fact.I decided to purchase the A200 based on two factors -- price and reviews. Both were excellent. Out of the box it is eye catching. Much smaller than my old Kodak with an automatic lens cover (nice to have!). Opening the lens cover fires up the camera and it's ready for the first shot within a matter of seconds. OK, here's where the annoyance factor kicks in. This is, by far, the slowest freakin' digital camera I have ever played with. A three hour visit to the camera sections of a few electronics stores this afternoon confirmed my first impression. It really is slow! You absolutely must depress the shutter release button 1/2 way and wait for it to autofocus before taking the shot. One cannot get a shot off quickly with this camera. I have a two year old. He is in another room by the time this camera is ready to take a picture of him. OK, so you've taken a picture, now the waiting continues. It takes roughly 12-17 seconds (depending on the charge in the battery) to recharge the flash and prepare for another shot!!! Yep, 12-17 seconds! My old Kodak is faster. In all fairness, when the flash is not used, the A200 is lightening quick at refreshing for the next shot. However, because of what I use it for, most of my shots are indoors and require the flash. What about picture quality? Not bad. Not great. Three out of the four professional reviews that I read about this camera state that the picture quality is excellent. The fourth review seems to concur with my opinion. The quality is OK. Red eye is an enormous problem, even with red eye reduction on. Again, hate to sound like a broken record, but my old Kodak...Professional reviewers seem to like this camera because of the manual controls. These are not important to me, as I just want to turn the thing on and take pictures. If you're just looking for a simple point and shoot camera, I wouldn't worry too much about manual options.One last complaint before I tell you what I exchanged the thing for... The controls on the back of the camera are completely unintuitive. No little jog-dial like you find on several other cameras, including the Canon A40 (an excellent, though clunkier, alternative complete with 3X optical zoom). So, after some serious thinking, reading, and playing, I decided to go with the Sony DSC-P31, also an autofocus, no optical zoom, 2.0 megapixel camera. About 20 beans more but it comes with two high capacity rechargeablee NiMH batteries. It has essentially every feature that the Canon A200 has and more. It even has an option to take pictures in 3:2 format, which is the perfect format for 4X6 prints I guess. No cropping needed. The big plus for me is that the thing is very very fast. Fast enough to take pictures of spazzy kids. Not only does it take pictures quickly but it is ready for the next shot in about 3 seconds even when the flash is used. It also has video out so that pictures can be viewed on your TV set or even recorded to VHS if you so desire. A nice feature. About Amazon, absolutely, hands down, the best place to buy things online in my opinion. They frequently offer free shipping deals and, of course, no tax. Customer service is incredible and it is very very easy to return products. They even pay return shipping. Also, you can keep track of the location of your package from the moment you place the order to the moment it arrives on your porch. Items always come sooner than they estimate. You can even cancel your order up to the moment that the product is prepared for shipping. Nice option in case your spouse doesn't agree with your decision to buy that $5000 plasma HD television set!Happy shopping!Update 12/29/02....  I've had my new Sony DSC-P31 for about a week now and took gobs of pictures with it during the Holidays.  I highly recommend this camera over the Canon A200.  Much easier to use, much faster, and more conistent picture quality with the Auto Focus on.  One cool thing about the camera that I didn't mention before is that, in addition to Auto Focus, you can set the focus to a range of different distances, like 3 meters, 9 meters, 30 meters... infinity.  I decided to disable autofocus and set the focus distance to 9 meters (I think, as I don't have the camera with me).  This makes the camera even faster than before and seems to provide better pictures than with the autofocus on!  I've had minor problems with red eye, as I gather is common with most cameras especially when shooting pictures of kids.  Luckily, this is easily fixable with the software that comes with the camera.

Every time I turned it on it said change the batteries. I changed the batteries and nothing happened. So I returned it and got the same one(I though mine was defective.) It had the same problem! So I returned it again and got the same one. The same problem!!!! But this time I got it to work for a minute. I took 2 or 3 pictures. The Digital zoom on it is terrible. I would advise you not to buy this camera. Dont waste your money. Buy the A40 instead.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "What monkey designed the menus?

Used AA's every half hour. I love to use technology, but this was the most unuser friendly manual and menu flow I have ever seen!  This reminded me of Apple's first attempt at a handheld organizer- the Newton.  If you never heard of it, its because was taken off the market almost immediately.  Absolutely horrible, as is this camera.  Can't take (or I wasn't willing to take the hours neccessary to figure out) action shots b/c two to three second delay when press shoot button. Impossible to time that much delay if moving photo, even family group photos hard (lots of closed eyes and broken poses) Further, after about 10 shots, with screen OFF, had to change batteries.  With screen on, could only take about two pictures, before batteries exhausted.  Sure, you could buy charger and nicads- but for additional price, suddenly I am getting close to a 3 MP camera that may actually be usable in everyday situations.

I finally learned how to step the camera up. I had to read the whole manual to do so. So far this camera has been horrible. It takes forever to focus, and the batteries run out after one day. If you have pets or small children this camera is not for you, because it takes to long to take pictures. ALso this camera comes with 2 MP.
