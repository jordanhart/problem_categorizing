Well I bought these because I wanted her to think I was serious about gathering \" evidence\" for a restraining order.I'm happy to report she hasn't said 1 word to me since the day of instillation, literally I went from being verbally attacked EVERY time I opened my front door to silence!This camera is sturdy and very realistic looking.I don't have the lights on because ive never seen a real camera flashing constantly so in my opinion it makes the camera look fake but the lights work fine on my 2 cameras.Shortly after getting them a friend who's got 22 years with the local police dept came by and while talking about my neighbor he asked to see the footage believing the cameras were real, that to me wad worth every penny.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not very impressed.", "Author": "J.

However, the micro-Phillips head screws which you need to remove in order to replace batteries are from hell.  Royally.  I have a small screw driver set, and even so, most of the 4 screws were extremely difficult to remove.  Once removed, I observed that the heads were becoming very stripped.  I don't know if next year I would be able to remove them again to replace batteries.I tried drilling out for larger screws, but all this did was basically destroy i and now I have to purchase another unit.  I have 3 units so I can't wait to see what the others have in store..  Those tiny tiny Phillips head screws are a piece of junk, even if you have the proper screw driver set.  Best to try a #2 phillips.  This is definitely the achilles heel of this product,I'm glad I waited to replace the batteries before reviewing.
