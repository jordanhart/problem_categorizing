{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sell your camcorder... BTW, nice picture quality too!", "Author": "V. D. Alfred", "ReviewID": "R1D1RQQJ0P1BTH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Casio digital camera. I've mostly used canon compacts and and the pentax tiny optios in the last years. What I have always looked for in a digicam is, in order of importance:A. Must be small enough to fit in my jeans pocket without adding too much bulk.B. Must be cheap (around US$200, better if it is at US$150 like this one, though I would pay up to US$250 for something with mega-great reviews).B. Must offer decent image quality. I don't care if it is not the best, and I don't care about megapixels (for me, 4 MP is enough), but it must be better than a cell phone, and reliable (90% of the shots should come out crisp, not blurry/crappy)C. Must have decent video, at least 640x480 at 30 fps. I don't care about the format (avi, mov, etc.), though I appreciate it more if it offers a compression format like divx or h264, for optimizing storage card space (so I don't have to buy more expensive memory cards).D. Must be fast. Okay, obviously I'm not expecting SLR-quick-operation, because no P&S; can offer that, but I DO expect a quick turn-on. I totally hate those slow-shutter-lag cameras that take a lot to turn on. What's the point if you want to capture spontaneous fun moments?---Okay, this camera filled all my requisites and I'm very satisfied. I've had it for a few weeks and I'm falling in love with Casio. I bought this small and sleek camera (about the same size as a credit card, even thinner than the canon SD1000) because of the great reputation of Casio with video mode, and I use a mac (supported by this camera), so I can edit the clips with my iMac at home.This camera has many many features, like all that popular stuff typical of these days (auto-shutter, face detection, shake reduction, etc.), and many \"Best Shot\" modes (they make it easier for you to take a pic, so you don't really need manual adjustments), but in my opinion, the absolute BEST thing this camera offers is an EXCELLENT VIDEO MODE. In a 2GB card you can fit 45 mins of super high quality movies (even better quality than some digital camcorders), and the camera has a \"movie button\" that you just press and it just starts recording, so you don't have to go through the menu and lose time looking for the REC icon.You can use the shake reduction mode with the video, and there's an option for youtube uploading that I don't really care about. Youtube mode lowers the resolution, limits the recording to youtube requirements (10 mins max for file, smaller file size) and uploads the clip directly to your youtube account without needing to use the web browser, as a software (that only works with windows) detects the clips when you connect the camera to the PC.Picture quality... well I can't complain. I've seen better quality in other digigams, but don't worry, the colors are very natural, the quality is very sharp, and the best thing: pics don't come blurred like with more expensive cameras from other brands. A bonus: if you use the \"dim light mode\" Best Shot scene, pictures taken with very low light come very very nice! even if you move your hand a bit, thanks to the nice shake reduction. And you won't see many \"grains\", really. This is something worthy to appreciate.Overall operation is fast, the camera is very 'intelligent' and selects the ISO according to the light with great exactitude, so it rarely uses flash like other small cams (very good to me, because I'm not a flash guy when indoors). However, if you want to use flash for snapshots it does it too, and with a very powerful light, so dont worry.Now, let me add that something I liked about this little machine is it's sturdiness. WOW. I have already dropped it 2 times, one from 4 feets into concrete inside a pouch, and the other time into the sink in a bathroom, with the lens out. I though this camera would not survive these kinds of hits, but I was wrong! It still works like a charm! ZERO damage, just a small scratch when it wasn't protected by it's case.As always in my reviews, I will tell you why I removed one star from this product:- Seems like lens just loves dust! Don't laugh, I'm serious, I've had other cameras for much longer time and they didn't really have dust problems, but this thing attracts many white small spots that are very hard to remove. They still have no effect on the images, and I hope it doesn't happen soon. Anyway, when it happens I will replace it, as I tend to use these cheap digicams as semi-disposable gadgets (I guess the cost of the lens-cleaning will be too much).- Sucks at macro. Really. I don't care about this feature because I just use my cameras to capture great moments in my life instantly, but if you are one of those persons who love to take very detailed close-ups of small insects and that kind of stuff, it may disappoint you. There are more advanced casio cameras out there (costing a few $$$s more), more suited for the \"professional\" that will satisfy those kinds of needs. This z-80 casio is geared towards the \"casual-shooter\".- Battery life dissapointed me. I had the idea that casio cameras were the best at battery life, but this one is not. The canon SD1000 I gave to my girlfriend lasted longer with one single battery. And it's not the video that drains the energy, the pictures are the ones to blame. I will try lowering the flash intensity to see if it reduces the consumption. Anyway, I'm buying another battery because it is always recommended to do it with any ultra-compact camera.Bottom line: If you use the video function A LOT in your digital cameras, and you want the best video mode in a very affordable (cheap) digicam right now, combined with a  solid-as-a-rock ultra-compact body that shouts elegance and decent image quality, this is the one to get.Casio has proved me that they can make GREAT digital cameras. Possibly my next buy will be one of their exilim \"S\" (card) series, because of their very slim build (more than this one!). I hope this reviews helps you decide.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "...the best digital point-and-shoot I ever had", "Author": "dorel_c", "ReviewID": "R36DGW6BIUF6NX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned several cameras, film and digital, and this is by far the best digital point-and-shoot I ever had. I have to admit that it took me a long time to decide on buying a Casio as opposed to Cannon, Nikon, or Pentax, as I had very good experience with those.However my wife was supposed to be the main user of this new camera, so when she saw it in a store, she was sold on it, as the camera is very small and very good looking. She loved the green one (which is actually a greenish yellow) so we paid $10 more than the black one and got it.To me it took a lot more to be convinced, so here is my point of view on it:Pros:- Very good quality of the pictures (the auto focus works great and the multi point metering system takes care nicely of most situations, including some more difficult shots (like high contrast, back lit subjects, moving subjects, etc)- I love that you can easily switch between standard format (1.33 ratio), film format (3:2 ratio), or wide screen (16:9 format).- Metal body, makes the camera fill solid and you can have a good grip and stability.- Easy to switch between different menus like changing formats, flash modes, ISO sensitivity, different self timer settings, shooting modes (like single, continuous, etc), auto shutter, and face recognition modes.- Although I consider face recognition a gimmick and I never use it in real life, I did try it and surprisingly works very well! Not only the camera will find and focus on the face, but you can set also the Auto-Shutter to take the picture only when the subject smiles. There is even more: you can record several faces in the camera's internal memory, and when those people are in a larger group, the camera will find their faces and focus on them, so they come out the best! I tried the freakish feature and it works!!!Also, it has other many Auto-Shooting features, that some people might want, I tried them, they work but, I don't normally need most of them.- The movie recording quality is very good. I set it to wide screen and the highest quality and it is exceptionally good, I say at least like a DVD (also it does record sound very well, with no significant camera's own noise).- It has its own movie recording button, so you do not need to go though any settings in order to start filming. You push the trigger on top, you take pictures, or if you push the trigger on the back side, you are filming (push again to stop). It can not get any simpler or faster.- If you don't like to mingle with settings, you may find the \"Best Shot\" setting very simple and useful. You click the \"BS\" button (funny name... ;-), and you get a bunch of sample photos. Use the left-right-up-down buttons to navigate to the picture that is similar to what you are shooting, push OK, and the camera sets itself up for that type of picture (like flowers, portrait, self portrait, sports, night scenes etc, etc).- I love the burst shooting mode (aka CS - Continuous Shooting), which has several settings:CS - shoots pictures at the quality you set as fast as possible;CS-FAST shoots lower resolution pictures and saves them to the internal memory. I got about 4 to 5 pictures per second in this mode, and the quality is good enough to print 5x7\" pictures. This is a life saver when your kid shakes hands with the principal of the school, when they make a karate jump, or when they throw that ball. Normally you push the trigger and hope the camera takes the picture at the right time. With this, you push the trigger a little earlier, hold it until the kid is through, and before you know it you have a series of pictures taken at short intervals of each other, so your chances are a lot better to find one that shows what you want to see.- Used with a 4GB SDHC memory card, my wife took literary hundreds of pictures and filmed many minutes of movie during a recent trip before she had to transfer them to the computer. She did that only several times during the 3 weeks trip.- Also, one charge of the battery lasted for several days. In fact she did not charge it until, into the four or fifth day of the trip, the low battery message came on.Negatives:None so important to give anything lower than a five star rating.- I would have liked a \"shorter\" focal length on the close end, so that you can have a wider view as sometimes there is not enough room to get away from larger groups of people. However most of the cameras have this focal lengths, so this is just a wish with small point and shoot cameras.All being said, I love this little camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Impressive", "Author": "Charles B. Clarke \"cbcmusic\"", "ReviewID": "R20OPX6GHLL1NJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice little camera, it takes great photos and great videos.  It would be better if the battery had a longer life, it will go for 1.5 hours taking straight video on a fresh battery, so it's not miserable.However, you will need to buy at least a 2 GB memory card. There is a small built in memory, but that is for the face recognition feature, it will only allow you to take 4 or 5 high quality photos, so you actually need to buy a memory card.It's easy to use and if you spend a few minutes reading the instructions that are included on the disc as a .pdf file, you will learn that this camera has lots of features to enhance your experience and all the features are relatively easy to use and incorporate. Of course, this camera performs great without going through the instructions.The one thing to make note of, there is software included but it is NOT compatible with MAC, fortunately I have iMovie that came with my iMac and it's all I need to edit video.  Don't worry though Mac users, the video this camera creates can be viewed without the help of any editing software, it will open using QuickTime.I hope this helps.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Kyle K.D.", "ReviewID": "RPXQORIFKVTV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For my first digital camera I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It's very compact, can be easily hidden away in a pants pocket etc.Take really great photos and the best thing is it's really easy to use. I don't have to spend 2 hours reading a stupid manual to find out what are the options.Everything about this camera is simple, I was shocked at how easy I can flip through options to change as I see fit.I am still to check out exactly how many pics the battery can handle before needing a recharge but I took a week fiddling around with the camera, took videos and pics, changing options, playing back the video on the television etc before the battery needed a recharge.This camera doesn't have a stupid time limit on videos, the length of the video depends on the space you have on the SD card, the 2gb card I have in give me about 1hr 10mins of video time which is great.Get a case for it though, the display screen on the back is HUGE(love it) so you don't want it getting scratched up.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lack of Cradle/Battery Removal is a Major Issue", "Author": "Gaelen M. Gates", "ReviewID": "R1TU57PQEKTG50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I echo the thoughts of many people here, this is my 3rd or 4th Casio Exilim (previous models broke due to my own abuse -- I carry a camera in all sorts of wet/hot/etc. conditions and drop it all the time) and it's a compact, user-friendly, all-around good camera for the price. BUT all my prior Exilim models have come with a charging/docking cradle. This model does not. What this means is that you have to remove the battery and insert it into a separate charger, and each time you re-insert the battery into the camera, you have to reset the date and time -- that's more of a hassle than you might think. For someone who likes to carry my camera around in my purse and charge it every night, it's a major drawback and something to consider.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Video from Casio Exilim

The video is even nicer when I play on my computer and also burned to DVD.  I also posted some pictures above so you could see.  If you play around with the camera, you will find it gives amazingnly clear, vivid photos.  I was so impressed with Chase's camera, I went and bought the Casio Exilim ex-z85.  (Same camera but with the 9.1 megapixels.  I posted a revied for that camera (with photos) as well.  This camera really does take nice photos and video and I highly recommend!Note I found the best quality by playing with the picture quality as far as megapixel count, contrast, sharpness and staturatin (increasing those). Once you find the settings that work for you and overall take the nicesest photos, go in to the Best Shot feature (BS) button at bottom right of camera, choose Register User Scene, and then it will ask you which photo to use (choose one of the photos that you took at the settings you like and then it will save it under Best Shot).  That way when you want to those settings again, turn camera on, press best shot button, choose that photo, and it will change the settings to what you used to take that photo you liked.

Hit that little button in the top right corner and you're videoing -you have to hit the button again to stop video otherwise it'll take a quick picture then go right back to videoing which is really cool.  I miss having the camera cradle where you sit the camera in to charge, do slideshow, usb, and connect to view on tv. But at least this charger actually stops charging when the battery is full. I'd always forget to unplug my camera when it was done, and that really killed my battery life. This one I don't have to worry. It also doesn't have that little red spot light that shows you the center of the picture you're about to take nor are you able to adjust the brightness of the screen, but it makes up for that by having all these other features that are very useful. (There's alot more features than my last one actually. There's a setting where the shutter will not click until it detects that the person is smiling!)  It's easy to figure out the menu; more user friendly than the other cameras I've seen. That's why I always stick to this brand. My last Casio took a year and a half to break from my always taking it off-roading and everywhere else.

It was shipped very quickly!  I couldn't be happier.  I love that it has its own rechargable battery.  It is quite slim and small which is what I was looking for.  One of the cons about the camera is the LCD screen does not display pictures to well.  It is poor quality, IMO.  Also, there was one pixel out on the screen.  With that said, this camera takes GREAT photos.  It is just hard to tell on the camera's LCD screen which is a little disappointing.  However, for around $100 I expected it not to be perfect.  Therefore, most of my qulaifications were met!  I bought the camera, a 4GB mem card, and a carrying case for around $150 ($144 to be exact) which also included shipping.  Great little camera for the $100 range!!", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "a great movie machine, an acceptable still camera", "Author": "C. Brown", "ReviewID": "R2OT9XOA79RZ0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only demerit I can give this camera is for the quality of the lens. If you like landscapes, this is not the camera for you as there is noticeable distortion and lack of focus at the perimeter of the images. If you take a landscape picture and try to use it as wallpaper on your PC - you won't be happy with the result. You cannot expect a great lens for $100! But this is no problem with movies (see below).If snapshots and pictures of people are your thing, this camera will work fine. The focusing ability is quick and accurate, color is very good and the flash is fine for providing even illumination. The macro mode is particularly nice for extreme closeups of flowers (macro is selected automatically if you pick the best-shot \"flower\" setting)The ability to assign functions for the left and right arrow buttons is much appreciated - I use them for quickly changing the exposure between area and spot modes, often needed when I have high contrast in the subject matter.Most settings can be assigned to remain in effect even after you have turned off the camera, so whatever your favorite kind of photography, you can avoid having to set things up every time you turn it on. A wide selection of \"best shot\" modes are easily chosen and you can even create your own. One of the best shot settings is for audio only - so you can use the camera as a sound recorder.Where this camera is really a steal is in making movies. The resolution is quite a bit lower than with still photos (as it is with all still cams that can also make movies) but that masks the lens flaws mentioned above. I bought this camera specifically for the movie-making capability and couldn't be happier with the result: smooth 30 frame-per-second takes, great color, low noise and decent audio unless it is a windy day.The special \"video\" button allows you to take a movie at any time without having to fuss with a menu selection. You can even capture a still shot while shooting a movie, though it will cause a momentary pause in the movie.If you plan on extensive movie shoots, say over 15 minutes, an extra charged battery wouldn't be a bad idea, but the secret of good movies is being very very sparing in the amount of time you shoot, especially since uploading to YouTube takes 10 to 15X the actual time of the movieThe EX-Z80 is a good buy.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera", "Author": "Noel Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R1BO11IFEZUMHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased three cameras now, this last purchase was for a gift.

I bought it at somewhat of an inflated price at an airport electronics kiosk. My present camera is a Kodak Z-710 but its just so big I find myself not having room to pack it. This Casio is a very small camera, almost the size of my cell phone. Because it did not come with a case I used my cell phone case. The box includes full instructions, a CD for loading the software on your computer, and 3 cables: charge cable with battery holder, usb cable, and a cable to display the pictures as a slide show by the Z80 on your TV. I have only had this camera for a few days, but I took around 80 pictures with it on vacation. I love the big 2.6 screen in back. This camera does not have a viewfinder. The camera is so small I have to make sure and use the wrist band. I know I will drop it if not.I am hoping for several years of picture taking with this new little gem.

I have figured it out but others will take more/less time depending on your background.Picture quality is good in normal/sun light.  Low light more difficult (it is no SLR).  Flash is OK but has \"burn\"/overexposed some pretty normal shots I thought could have been better.Best shot feature is handy and works on the dozen or so times I have used it.I like the focus feature in combination the green/red indicated exposure good/bad.At times it is hard to tell if the picture taken is in focus on the small viewing screen.  You can enlarge it if necessary.Battery has a separate charger: advantage - can charge one battery while other is in use.  Disadvantage - you need to additionally haul the charger along on trips and purchase a second battery if you really want to take advantage of this feature.Battery life is acceptable but I have found myself short on battery life a couple of times when not making a concerted effort to recharge it.I would recommend this for the person who wants an \"on the go\"/easy to carry/standard pictures type camera.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works just fine", "Author": "A.
