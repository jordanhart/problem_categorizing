{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A remarkably competent long-zoom camera that costs very little", "Author": "conradb212", "ReviewID": "R35LUPBMDXXT1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's absolutely remarkable how far digital cameras have come. And how much camera you can get for the money these days. And that's precisely the problem camera makers face today: it's hard to make a profit as prices drop ever lower. And, adding insult to injury, almost all of today's smartphones already have increasingly competent high res still/video cameras built in.That's why we're seeing the traditional camera makers get into specialties and niches that the smartphone cameras can't touch (yet). Things like tough cameras that can go underwater, or, as is the case with the SZ-12 from Olympus, a very long optical zoom. Most inexpensive cameras have 3X to 5X optical zooms. The SZ-12 has 24X. That means you can get really close to far-away objects, and unlike digital zoom that multiplies the reach of most digital cameras, optical zoom results in much better and sharper pictures. And the SZ-12's rather sophisticated image stabilization works remarkably well.The SZ-12 has other nice features, like a bright and sharp 3-inch LCD display and it can take not only those high-res 14-megapixel pictures, but also very respectable 720p HD video. That's not quite the 1080p that takes full advantage of today's large HDTVs, but you usually can hardly tell the difference between 720p and 1080p.In terms of features, the SZ-12 has pretty much everything that some of the much more expensive Olympus cameras have (like the $350 Tough TG-810 or so). The controls are simple and easy to figure out. While the camera is described as \"stunningly sleek and stylish,\" the SZ-12 is really an inch and a half thick, and a full 3.5 inches with the lens fully motored out. It's still very handy, though, and the film camera-like bulge on the right side makes for a good grip.While the SZ-12 looks like it's solid metal, it's really plastic and actually feels a bit, dare I say it, on the cheapish side. And a couple of other blemishes: the battery doesn't last as long as I'd like, and the camera tends to oversaturate color.Overall, the Olympus SZ-12 offers an awful lot for not much money, and the good greatly outweighs the few issues. I'd buy this one again.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb Digital Camera Can Do it All", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3Q50XNW82AG65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My perspectives on the Olympus SZ-12 camera derive from my extensive photographic experience--mostly and formerly with 35-mm technologies (last century)--in photographing biological and scientific subjects; wild plants, vegetation communities, etc. I am an accomplished photographer of such subjects.In summary, the Olympus SZ-12 digital camera is unsurpassed in almost every regard. It is relatively inexpensive, it is feature-packed (and the features actually function well), it is small, and the camera is easy to use. It is superbly designed. For those who wish to utilize advanced telephoto lenses (this camera has a 35-mm equivalent 600mm lens--which is a gigantic telephoto), along with wide-angle shots (this camera has a 35-mm equivalent 25mm lens, which is a wonderfully broad wide-angle, seldom found on cameras of this size and price), the lens capabilities, alone, set this camera apart.But more important than the long telephoto lens is the camera's dual image stabilization system, which works extremely well. I am able to take clear, unblurred telephoto closeups in rather low light, and often hand-held. Of course, it's always best to use a tripod, or at least prop the arm and camera against a tree or solid object before snapping a long telephoto shot, to minimize image motion at high magnifications. But this camera allows you to grab close-in telephotos at long lens lengths with remarkable clarity. In bright overcast and sunny clear skies, hand-held full length telephotos turn out exceptionally well. Now perhaps I'm better at keeping the camera fixed and still when snapping long telephoto shots, as I'm a very good rifle marksman. Still, the image stabilization system of this camera is superb.And it also allows the taking of normal, non-telephoto shots in lower light conditions, hand-held. The combination of wide angle to long telephoto, coupled with its superb image stabilization systems allow the taking of photos in reduced light or distant placements that few other cameras can--and no other camera matches these capabilities at the modest price of the Olympus SZ-12. The wide angle and telephoto capabilities are unmatched.I like the camera controls layout. They are about as intuitive as possible. A real problem I've encountered on other cameras is a confusion between still photography and movie photography controls. On some other digital cameras I've used, I've inadvertently begun to shoot a video sequence, when I thought I was taking my preferred still shot. Very frustrating. Not so with this Olympus, where the video start button is clearly marked (different, bright color) and located separately from the still shot controls. Well designed. Thank you, Olympus. When I want to shoot some video, I can easily press the right key. Otherwise, I never inadvertently touch it.All the other features and controls are similar to other digital cameras in the $200 price range. No, the camera does not shoot RAW images, only JPEG. But at 14MB, images are finely detailed. Color renditions are superb. I have not used the flash feature, so I have no comment on its functionality--but I do like the ease with which automatic flash can be turned and left off.Frankly, this little wonder has all the capabilities of the three 35-mm single lens reflex cameras I used to use to shoot wildlife and nature photos in my business (as a biologist). Now, with a single small camera kept in a cheap little nylon case, I can shoot macro closeups without any supplemental lens, and turn in an instant and shoot a flying bald eagle two hundred yards away, bringing her right into the image. With the super-macro feature, I can quickly and easily fill a frame with a full-sized bee or wasp, several feet away. The images are quickly recorded on the card, which is instantly and easily retrieved and plugged into the photo-card shot on my computer for instant download.For those who wish only to point and shoot, or for those more experienced with variable zoom lens and atypical photographic subjects, this camera can't be beat.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "better than I was expecting", "Author": "mwolfe83", "ReviewID": "R1AVIR1P1PC78G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Folks really push Nikon and Canon so I was a little worried about getting Olympus. (My wife liked it) I have had an Olympus dslr in the past and I can't say anything bad about it.  Anyway, it is a good little camera.24X zoom: great to have that ability but if you don't know how to use a camera pushed to 24x zoom, then don't bash the camera for it.  You are not going to get great results if there isn't a bunch of light at 24x.iauto:  when you first turn the camera on, it defaults to P (program) mode which gives you full control over the settings.  switch over to iauto and let the software do that for you.  If you are buying this camera, you probably are looking for a point and shoot. I read a review where someone complained about bad shots and I think that might be why. The camera will stay there until you change it again.Flash: the flash has to be flipped out manually but this isn't a bad thing.  I kind of like it that way. beats trying to find it on a menu when you really want to turn off/on the flash.  Just get in the habit of flipping that little switch as it is powering on and you are set.Magic filters: kind of dumb but you have them if you want them.  would be great if they were apple iPad filter quality.Video: there is a button for that.... great idea!  no fumbling through menus. The quality is good.Display:  the pictures seem a little bleached out on the little back screen but when you get them imported into picasa or some other photo management system, they look great.14MP: I played around with the other MP settings on the camera and I really couldn't see any difference between 8 or 14 MP.  Granted, all I was doing was zooming in.  I wasn't printing any picture.quick:  The camera seems quick unless there is low light.  in low light, the pictures take longer to shoot because the shutter has to stay open longer to gather enough light.  this makes for smeary pics if you have a moving target.. This isn't specific to Olympus, just a note I wanted to throw out there.OverallWe have had the camera for about a week now and I don't have any complaints.  A great deal of the technology in Olympus's DSLR's I have found to be available on this camera.  you have to get used to their interface but that is to be expected.  I will update this review if we have any problems with the camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "molly j", "ReviewID": "R300FZ3JKSBE1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera a few days ago.

I have taken about 40 pic's with it indoors and outdoors. The pic's are very,very good and being a passenger in my roomates truck taking pic's going down the road,it stops the movement very well. I've seen a few other reviews on here that say their pic's don't turn out good and their blurry and I'm pretty sure it's just a case of not having it set on the right settings. I have taken pic's for over 30 years and the first good camera I had was the old time 35mm Film SLR Cannon AE1 Camera with interchangable lenses back in 1980 and it's all about learning the right settings for the conditions. This is an awesome little camera ! The zoom is great !------------------------------------------------------------------UpDate : Well finally got outside and the one thing I have noticed about the zoom is that anywhere past 20x when taking pictures of birds,rabbits ect it come's out blurry. When you look at the picture it looks ok,but when you zoom in you can see the blur. This was a major disapointment to me as I love to take animal pictures. :( ..... I tried all different setting and no matter what the blur is still there. However, if you just like regular shots and don't go past 20x then it's not bad...................................................So needless to say I'm going to be getting a different camera. Have seen good reviews on the Nikon Coolpix L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom. It's a fairly small camera which is what I'm looking for, so going to be getting one to see.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Baptism in fire for this little camera.", "Author": "Rusted Nut Garage", "ReviewID": "RS1FLF110HQIV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Impressions of the Olympus SZ 12 Digital Camera.I have been looking to update my Digital Camera for some time and after quite a bit of research I opted for the Olympus SZ 12.  Probably the factors that drew me to it were the small form factor, relatively low cost, and large zoom.After a few weeks of trial and error I threw the camera in a suitcase and flew off to Maui to document a ceremony and do a little whale watching.  Yep, fly or die, I will soon know if the purchase was prudent.The short answer is that this is a good little camera, with just a few things standing between good and great. One of my first compromises was the lack of a range finder, contrary to what they would like you to believe, those LCD's are hard to see when you get out into the bright sunlight.  Not impossable but difficult was my conclusion.I also compromised on my AA battery requirement.  The Li 50B battery that came with the camera does not have particularly good life (50 or 60 pictures maybe).  If you purchase one of these cameras then you should also pickup the external charger and batteries for $14.95.Do not get taken in by the impressive zoom (24X).  There is no way you are going to be able to hand hold this camera and get a good clear shot when shooting at 24X!  You will however get a shot, just do not expect a lot.  The Auto Focus is also very marginal when you get out at long distances.Like the great majority of digital cameras It struggles a lot when you attempt to take pictures in low light conditions without the flash.  However the flash pictures are very good.In the automatic mode this little camera does a pretty good job of getting the correct exposure for most situations.  There are an impressive number of filtered settings that are easy to use and work pretty well.  Outdoors it does a pretty good job of rendering colors and produces very good results.Ergonomically this small camera has probably one of the best designs I have ever seen.  I spent some time trying to open the small rubber cover on the back of the camera until I realized it was meant to be a grip rest for my thumb.  The shape of the case facilitates one hand operation.I would recommend downloading the user manual that comes on the CD and give it a good through read.  There is a lot of features in this little camera and a cruse through the manual would be helpful.So if you are not Ansel Adams and you are looking for a good little grab shot camera you might give this camera a good long look.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent Camera", "Author": "Benja", "ReviewID": "R19KP3JWRIG34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excelent camera for the price.

The zoom has a soft grinding sound when zooming in or out, but not irritating unless you're recording a symphony orchestra.  Has 29 minutes limit for recording any video at the max HD, unless you go for lower resolution for longer recording.  Audio recording is quite loud enough for conversation in a 20x20 room.The panorama feature is easy.  It provides a small star icon on the sides of each shot and you pan camera to link new shot to the previous star.  But the final output of a panorama shot is smaller than a normal shot; so enlargement is quite limited.  E.g. when taking 3 panorama shots, you are compressing 3 pictures into one.The latch on door to battery/SD card compartment underneath is tiny, using finger nail to open/shut.  Be careful not to inadvertently open it.Photos are sharp when my hands don't shake too much.  Colors are true to life.  Conclusion, unless using a tripod, when using zoom, the steadier your hands, the sharper the photos.

The features that are packed into this compact camera are impressive to say the least. It's a very well thought out design. The controls are very friendly, I especially like the flash release. It has enough manual settings in program mode to satisfy me for when IAuto isn't doing the job.  The performance indoors, even without the flash is outstanding. I will update this review when I have used the camera more, but I have a question I hope someone can answer.When I press the shutter release halfway down, the camera makes a buzzing/static like noise while auto focusing. It might be normal for this camera, but I'm not sure, and I am trying to decide if I should return it. I've owned many digital cameras, and I've never had one make this kind of noise when focusing.EDIT to ADD: The dual image stabilization is what is making all the noise. It has 3 settings in the menu, on...off.... and ...while exposing. Mine came with it set on from the factory, but for photo shooting, it should be set to \"while exposing.\" I can't hear the noise at all now except for when I intentionally set it for a very long exposure in night scene mode. I will turn it \"on\" when shooting video, but oddly enough the camera is completely silent when shooting video.I would highly recommend this camera. It's a good size, a little larger than a standard compact, but much smaller than the larger P&S; models. It can be slow to focus at times, but that is to be expected for a camera in this price range, I paid 149 new, w/free shipping. The images are better than I'd expected, again, considering the price. The flash is adequate for what it is intended, and well designed. The battery performs well, but an additional battery and external charger are a good investment, and can be found very inexpensive on Amazon.I've upped my review to 5 stars. I don't see how anyone could ask for more than 14MP, and 24X zoom in a compact design at this price point, that consistently produces accurate exposures in most situations. This camera is not my best camera, but will get much more use than my Pen E-PL1 because of it's convenient size and versatility.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quite a disappointment", "Author": "cnyadan", "ReviewID": "RE0P1VMXV9XON", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a daily camera user, and I got this on special to replace a Canon camera with similar specs because the Canon's flash no longer works.  Unfortunately, 3 months later, I'm back to using the Canon more often than this camera.Now, the SZ-12 does do decently outside, both in daytime and at night.  However, I was looking for a camera that would take nice pictures indoors as well, particularly of kids (who don't stay still to pose).In any case, for a long time, I just thought I was missing something, and over the last couple of months, I have been through all sorts of settings, and nothing seems to help much.  I am already now looking for something to replace this one.Right away, I noticed that the camera almost sounded like it was grinding inside to adjust the zoom.  I looked this up, and supposedly this is \"normal\".  The other thing that I noticed right off is that although the file sizes are 80% larger than my Canon (also 14mp) it is a lot less sharp, and if one needs to shrink the file size, say for email, the picture starts looking pixellated right away.  Even with my 5.1mp camera, I never had that happen so badly.The flash on this camera is too bright - if you take pictures inside, it makes it look like the whole room - except for what the flash hits - is a dungeon.  The flash then is too bright on the subject.  It's so uneven, that if one uses the camera vertically, it's noticeable as to what side of the subject the flash was on.  Also, any picture on a subject that is less than half a room away will look washed out.  I think I've gotten severe red-eye on every single picture I've taken with this camera of people indoors, even with the \"red eye\" function, which itself is a joke.  The red-eye function, instead of being a red light that flashes along with the flash, ends up being some sort of \"pre-flash\" - if you can imagine, kind of a \"fluttering\" light, then a pause of about a second, then the \"real\" flash.  So, forget trying to get pictures of kids with this (even if it would work), because they don't sit around just to have pictures taken.  (Hence, blurry & unfocused pictures.)The focus on this thing is horrible.  I take pictures, look on the screen, many look lovely, then later, I get them on the computer, and they are really grainy and often nothing is focused very well.  I've taken pictures at three occasions so far involving birthday cake, and every single one of those pictures looked horrible - so much so that I could tell on the screen - and no setting seems to be able to rectify this.  Many times, this camera makes solid color walls look kind of like those old 1970's shag rugs, which were made up of fibers of many different shades of a color.I contacted Olympus about the camera, and after explaining the problem, and sending them examples, they said I could send the camera in for \"evaluation\".  Well, it turns out that I probably no longer have the receipt, and so it seems that I have absolutely no recourse here.  I can guarantee you, though, I will never be buying an Olympus product again.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for concerts or night lighting", "Author": "Susan J.

Several major issues - there is no stabilizer on video - so,if handheld when zoomed, it will look like you were shooting during an earthquake and make people seasick.  Truly unable to watch for long or post on Youtube (private setting). A tripod is absolutely necessary for zoomed video.  Second - the vertical column distortion was amazingly awful.  Bruce Springsteen concert - the video of the stage looks like a modern art painting - quite impressive, except I wanted concert video and not modern art. I showed it to my brother, who is an optical engineer, and he was really impressed at how bad the column distortion was (sometimes a cm wide).  Apparently, Olympus is using older-model sensors that bleed easily into other columns.  Never saw it with my $150 Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ10. Ever.  And, to top it off the sound was mediocre and the low light pics were usually blurry.Amazon had a lightening deal on the Canon Powershot SX230HS three weeks later.  Took both cameras to a concert.  Sat back row of Radio City Music Hall, 2nd Mezzanine.  Nice and dark, and far away from the stage.  Took pics and video.  Zoomed tight, medium and wide - and returned the Olympus the next day.  Powershot had outstanding zoom - and stabilization on video, great sound, nice low-light pictures - and is incredibly compact for that much camera.  Outshone the Olympus in every way.

Both were at the same venue - the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, NJ.  Each time I was about the same distance from the stage.The Parliament/Funkadelic Concert with Morris Day in Fall of 2012 announced and enforced no video restrictions.  I have several video clips where I shot wide to zoom.  The quality of the footage was better than I expected.  I say this, because this camera was the most affordable successor, with the features that I had missed  from Lumix ZS-5 that decided to shut down on me in 2011 after three years of (sometimes very rough and rugged) service.  I paid about $180 for it.  At any rate, the focus was excellent, and the sound was between good and excellent.  Take note that I am doubly cursed.  I was a hard-core film photographer (35mm SLR, 6x6/6x7 cm rangefinder, SLR, TLR)  until my son gave me a Kodak digital camera for Christmas in 2004 which changed my life as a photographic artist.  I am also a performer and composer with a Rutgers degree in music.  Quality of both images and sound are anal issues for me, so when I say the sound and video were good, others would probably say excellent.I attended a concert by Earth, Wind and Fire in May, 2013, also at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  This concert had flash and video prohibitions.  The images (all with no flash) were breathtaking whether zoom or wide - even when there was a lot of conflict of light, shadow and contrast.  These shots were more of a challenge, and made me use my hard-learned photographer skills, but the shots were the envy of the group of folks who attended with my wife and me.This camera is made for the snapshooter and the sharpshooter alike.  There is something for everyone in this little box.  Picture quality, recovery time, features, modes - I love this camera, and writing this review has helped me to decide to go ahead and buy one for my son for his 29th birthday.  I originally wrote this as a response to a somewhat negative review by consumer Susan Brillhart regarding concert and nighttime video and still images.One thing I will add as a tip to anyone buying ANY camera.  You have to go ahead and experiment with every feature and mode.  The camera (least of all this one) will not blow up or turn to dust in your hand or a worthless piece of plastic.  You have to try the various shooting modes, the \"smart\" image modes, the panorama, \"trick\" or \"magic\" or whatever modes, with & without flash, full program mode,  video, light-balance, digital zoom, etc.  ISO is a most important feature to understand. The higher you set it, the lower the light requirement for a decent image.  However, the tradeoff is the higher the ISO you use, the less resolution (or more graininess)you will have. It costs you nothing now.Some of you are, as I, converted film photographers with at least two different format film rigs in a closet somewhere.  You remember when it co$t film and proce$$ing co$t$ to test the limits and abilities of their rigs.  That could be real money.  With digital, you can play with the various settings to see what they do, upload them to your PC (or MAC) look at them, learn from them, and either keep your goofs as interesting backgrounds (as have I) or delete them.  The more you know of what the camera can (or cannot) do, the more you will appreciate its value (or lack thereof) - and all it cost you was time.And this is all I will say.  I could, as you can probably see, go on and on, but I  will stop here.  Suffice it to say that the Olympus SZ-12 14MP Digital Camera with 24x Wide-Angle Zoom (Black) is a great camera at great price.  You get more than what you pay for with this camera.  I mean, even with its Leica glass, the Lumix is like an old fiancee.  Great, wonderful, indispensible  - in its time.Feel free to ask questions.

The screen is SUPER bright and easy to see anywhere. If you are trying to take a picture that should have a flash it will alert you & you can decide to use it (for a picture less than 20' away) or just hold still and be surprised.IF you want features, muscle and options this thing will make you cry tears of joy.With 24x OPTICAL zoom my kids faces are crystal clear at the school program. Zooms all the way in our kid from the seats half way back in a 300 person auditorium. It rocks for football and is 100% functional in 720p HD video mode. The wide angle has a 70 degree field of view. In other words from the corner of a room you can capture 77% of the room. Any wider and you get the \"fish eye\" distortion. Then there is macro for stuff less than like 3 feet and super macro for stuff less than an inch (yes, really).There are many modes that remember how you set them. True panoramic (I zoomed in on my daughter's class choir to get faces top to bottom and made a true panoramic view right to left at like 10x zoom including every student in hi res)Other modes include 3d, magic / special effects, Scene (fireworks, beach, snow etc) IA - intelligent auto as mentioned above, and my favorite as a nerd P for programmable.This baby has a setting called in the Programmable mode. H, H1, and H2. These take consecutive pictures as long as you hold the shutter (H= click, click, H1 = 2x as fast (multiple pics per second at 3mpx) and H2 = as near high speed as this can go (speed depends on megapixels the lower the faster). I just tested H2 and got over 10 pics per second for 4 seconds. You may have heard those pro cameras that have an SLR lens that can sound like a deck of cards being shuffled at media and sports events. Similar deal. Here is the kicker. It can only hold so much info in Ram so at H1 7 seconds is max shoot time on high speed consecutive shots. But it takes 6 shots a second. I just tested it on the clock's second hand. Then your camera is basically disabled while it is writing to SD card for 80 seconds if you filled the the entire ram. Much less if not. I've never before needed 7 seconds of high speed but it's there if you do. I photograph lots of birds at our feeder and this mode is SUPERB for getting good shots of those fast moving birds, even in flight. There is NO WAIT if you don't fill the RAM completely. You can grab 2 seconds, and then grab 2 more a second later with no delay (on H1). Looking forward to High Speed my son in football.So there it is. No kitchen sink but talk about bang for your buck. OH YEAH!!Cons: The dual stabilizing lenses can be heard on video when recording in silence. That feature can be shut off but I'd rather have a steady picture than worry about a sound you only hear in a silent room.Flash must be opened or it will just take good pics without unless you are real in real low light. The flash pops up when you hit a button. Forget to push the button and no flash.When shooting high speed stills at 4 or 10 pics per second (at 3 mpx) if you fill the ram (shoot for over 7 seconds non stop) the camera's memory or ram needs to unload to your sd card. This takes 80 seconds and you just have to wait (or take high speed in 4 second bursts with a few seconds in between and there is NO delay at all).It wasn't free.no kitchen sink or toaster720p hi def instead of 1080. I guess I'm old. I don't see the dif.Will not operate on USB power with a dead battery.Not sure if there is any alternative to that exact rechargeable battery (even though it works well) it would be nice to be able to pop in a couple AAs as some camera rechargeables allow. Not sure if that type would hold as much power. This has a bright screen and constant motion inside while shooting as the 2 stabilizing lenses never stop while your finger is on the shutter or recording video. I imagine it would eat AAs like tic tacs.Other Thoughts: PS.

My favorite is having the ability to manually set the functions in order to improve on the attributes of a photo. I also use a Nikon 5200 which I have had for a couple of years and use for more serious shooting. However, because of the compactness and versatility of the Olympus, I am tending to pack it with me all of the time and take the Nikon for those intense photographic encounters. The Olympus also seems to be more durable than the Nikon Coolpix cameras which I have had as they did not hold up to being packed around in a pocket or purse. Even though the Olympus weighs a bit more thank the Coolpix, for my use, the difference is worth it if it is not so fragile.

Since they were living with me at the time, I took their camera.It was so easy to use, set the mode - panaorama, auto, short videos, scenery (zoomed out and in), people, indoor shots of the churches and museums, etc.  A few shots were blurry - particularly where we were walking and I was just holding the camera up over my head and clicking away, and some of the indoor low light indoor ZOOMED shots as well (the Pieta :-{ ).  The battery held the charge for over two weeks and 1500 shots!!!  I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance.Not sure if this one comes with the Olympus software, but since my E-620 did, I just plugged in and uploaded using the Olympus Master software, which has editing capabilities as well, so if you don't like the color, balance,filters etc. used during shoot, you can change them once uploaded.The kids moved out a few months ago, so I need a good pocket type camera to keep in my purse.

Plus, for grab shots, it isn't practical to carry my dSLR around with me. As we like to paddle kayaks, I'd much rather get this wet than my more expensive camera.So, on to the merits of the camera. It has an extremely quick focus with no problems with shutter lag. The viewfinder is about typical in daylight shots. The video does a pretty good job. Obviously, these pics are not quite as good as my more expensive dSLR and video cameras, but I wouldn't expect them to be.I am impressed with the optical zoom. I keep the ISO set on 400, and it zooms quickly and focuses quickly on subjects, with a fast enough shutter speed to prevent blurring in most situations. I won't rehash what others have already written.My cons? I was using it on the second day, and noticed that where I had put it in and taken it out of a zippered case had put several scratches on the glass viewfinder. My thumb had rubbed several dull spots on the right side. Not cool. It's pretty obvious that the glass could have been better. I have since sacrificed one of my mil-spec tablet screen covers and solved the problem.I haven't printed any pics yet, so I can't advise as to the print quality. Some macro shots of a crab apple tree in blossom had good focus and color saturation.The video on a Facebook video was grainy at first, but if you click HD, it cleans up nicely to a sharp image. I guess it went down to low res for posting. A nice feature is that you can turn the mic off. For voice overs and music in editing, this is a good feature.I did get a Joby bending mini tripod for timer shots and videos. It wraps around stuff, and has seriously strong magnets, plus a panning handle.Anyway, for the money, I think it is a good camera that is small enough to take places as a backup, pocket camera, or for hiking and paddling. For paddling, I have a clear case from Wally World that has a gasket with snaps. It keeps it nice and dry, and has a hook to lash it to the cockpit.

I photograph birds and enjoy the Program mode set to \"HI1\" that shoots four 5 mp shots per second till the built in memory is full (around 60 shots or so) then it reveals it's one somewhat frustrating flaw in that while it is writing info to the SD card you cannot take pictures. Another flaw is the vertical line that appears on video when you get the sun in frame on a snowy bright day. It overloads the CCD or something and you get a vertical white line. So....don't do that. It has only happened to me when taking video of sledding on a sunny winter day. Otherwise you can select \"scene\" and beach or snow and it clamps down on the brightness to produce first class photos. It has many built in \"scenes\" it does good 3D and great panoramic which is super user friendly. It shoot s 720p mono audio video. One annoyance is that the mic pics up the image stabilizing as it moves both an inner lens and the ccd itself (hence dual stabilization) so you hear a flutter on video when you are shooting video in a quiet place. However, you can always turn the sound off and in any venue like a game or choir concert you'll never hear it on the video (which is very smooth and steady even in semi shaky hands). This is my second SZ-12. The first was damaged when sent out with family to document an outing and they run the battery dead and tried to push the lens shut. DON'T DO THAT.  derrr.  In regard to the battery it is robust and lasts a LONG time on a single charge. I'm guessing you can shoot an hour of video on a single charge. Extra batteries are not hard to find nor expensive. I got a second thinking I'd need it with a charger for a reasonable price on line. I've never run the thing dry on my own. I think those I lent my last one too left it on between taking pics and the auto focus and very bright large screen may have run it down. Now that I think back it wasn't fully charged when they took it.  This camera is the only one in the price range that has over 20x optical zoom. The digital zoom has come a long way since the blocky days of 500x digital zoom on 8mm video cameras. I took some of the moon and people on fb were asking me what kind of camera I took it with. I set it to \"night scene\" and went full digital zoom, leaned against a tree and slowly squeezed off a couple and it came out really well including craters and the works all with maxed out optical and digital zoom. I don't use digital generally. 24x is plenty anyhow.  I've owned a pretty nice SLR 35mm with 305mm lens and lots of add ons. This outperforms that in both speed and quality.  I recommend it highly.

And pesky birds have a way of flitting from one flower/branch to anotherThis is not a case of sour grapesI have the Canon 50x 'compact', Olympus m43 100-300 (which works out to 200-600mm) and various other stuffBut if you're not a professional, it's not easy to lug a camera with such zooming power every day, wherever you goColleagues and neighbours find it strange that I have to carry a pouch for the Lumix fz200 (24-600 f2.8)But the SZ14 can slip into a trouser back pocket - just make sure not to accidentally power up and wreck the zoom lensMost people class this as a travel cameraBut for me, when I travel, this won't be the only camera I bring(although it will be on my belt most of the time)Holidays for me are about pictures and I would take the Micro 43 cameras with 7.5mm fisheye, 9-18 (18-36), 14 (28) 2.5, 20 (40) 1.7 and 45 (90) 1.8The 75 (150) would be great but I can't afford itSo obviously I realize the limitations of the sz14But I would rather have a camera that can get a tight shot of a hummingbirdThan carry a camera that can get pin sharp shots - but all shot with a 40mm perspectiveYeah, it can be a pain scrolling through buttons to change ISO, EV etc etcThen again, for now, the most powerful zoom lenses are probably eitherCanon's 28-300 (full frame)or Nikon's 200-400 (full frame)Both costly and hugeOf course, if anyone could make a compact of this size with a 24-600mm f2.8 lens, Programmed, Aperture, Shutter and Manual and cost less than $1k, sure I would buy it26 Jan - the spot-metering is not as good as it should bea. there's no circle indicating the spot-meter area (unlike the Nikon p310)b. the spot meter doesn't seem very accurate, so pictures are not as dramatic as they could be", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Flawed camera, BAD in action and low light shots", "Author": "Brian G", "ReviewID": "R3T0HFXSQELEPC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my wife in April of 2013.

Our last camera was a Kodak Easy-Share, and it was a reconditioned model. We wore it out. The photos were grainy, it had no zoom, and even outdoor pics in broad daylight left a lot to be desired.The Olympus SZ-12 is a huge improvement. The lens is large enough and wide enough to let in plenty of light, even for indoor shots with no flash. If daylight is coming in from windows, you will have great natural lighting. Be advised that the flash doesn't automatically come on in low light -- you have to flip it up manually. The focus is crystal clear. If the object of the shot is in motion, there will be some blur, but not much (like a dog wagging its tail), if the CAMERA moves during the shot, however, you will need to retake the shot.The zoom feature works beautifully. Pictures that used to show mountains barely there, far away on the horizon, now show up-close details of shrubbery, trees, and even grasses. We haven't tried the pan shot or video features yet, but we sure are pleased with what we've done so far.The time between pressing the button and the picture being taken is a fraction of a second, but the delay between taking the picture and being ready for the next shot is about 3 seconds. For us, that's not a huge deal, but for a devoted hobbyist photographer -- or a pro -- this would be a bad thing.The battery charged in less than 2 hours, and we got an 8 GB Sandisk memory card for it at Walmart. The more megapixels you use, the fewer shots you can take. The camera comes with a default setting at 14 MP, and we used up the onboard memory within 12 photos. When I reduced it to 3 MP, we suddenly had lots more room! With the camera set at 3 MP and the memory card in place, we can take over 9,000 pictures!!So, if you aren't a pro or devoted hobbyist and just want a really good camera for taking pics of the things you love, this is a great little work-horse. The vendor was terrific, though since we live in a remote location, delivery was delayed over a weekend. Our camera is new, not reconditioned, and we love it. We found it to be very intuitive to figure out how things work, and a quick reading of the manual (print or CD) will fill in the details.The features and capabilities of this little camera out-strip anything put out by any other digital camera maker, IMHO. After reading about Nikon, Canon, Kodak, Sony, and Panasonic, this one had the best of what we wanted for the price we could afford.

My researches brought me to Olympus SZ-12 which I've purchased. I am totally satisfied with it. The camera is fairly compact for the lens it packs. It's made of plastic while front plate is metal. Grip is very decent, so is controllability. There are two awkward things about this little camera, first of which is mode dial. It has usual 4-way control coped with ability to rotate. It's a little confusing, perhaps needs some getting used to. Second thing is battery charging. You have to charge it via USB cable + charger, inside the camera. It's not what I like, but it is bearable.Of course SZ-12 suffers from all the drawbacks of small sensor (lower image quality than larger format cameras, bad high ISO performance) and superzoom lens (image distortion, chromatic aberrations), but these are flaws that all cameras of this kind have so I give Olympus SZ-12 5-star rating and recommend it highly to anybody who wishes to have decent superzoom for low price.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great walk around camera", "Author": "Jeanne Laux", "ReviewID": "RJNRNJGQ6G53V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light, easy to handle, powerful zoom,  easy to use functions.Fun 'Photoshop' features if wanted.Only complaint:  no black and white.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Rex Allen", "ReviewID": "R2NCDUG5V7U92S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "nice little camera...takes great pictures.....the zoom really doesn't bring things that close...it says it is a 24 but i would guess it to be more like a 10.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Mary-O", "ReviewID": "R2DDOC7KQC5UU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good little camera.

Thank goodness for amazon prime and their two day shipping. It got here just in time and the battery was already charged for me, so that was a nice plus too. I was really hesitant to NOT take my \"real\" camera since I knew we were going to aquarium, but I also knew I'd regret it if anything happened to damage it, so this was a compromise. I thought it did great for taking pictures of the scenery and the city- even as we were driving by. It also did pretty well in nicely lit areas. The only time I was kicking myself for leaving the dslr at home was in the aquarium. No matter what settings I used or tweaked, or even while steadying myself against a wall- I just didn't get many, if any, decent or usable shots. It has a special setting for low light situations- but even that didn't really work very well, not even with the flash employed- it washed everything out. However, I knew that was a possibility, so overall I'm fairly pleased with this camera. It's definitely great for walking around and situations where you don't want your more expensive gear to get possibly damaged or stolen, and I got it for $109 and free shipping- so it was fairly budget friendly to me as well.

I have been fiddling around with it to get used to it.  Thank heavens for digital photography and rechargeable batteries - I don't have to worry about wasting money on film and batteries.  I have been taking some pictures around the area to get used to it and find it really easy to use.  The camera has great capabilities but it is also very easy to use for basic shooting.  The camera seems to go from off to fully on (booted up) in about a second.  Focusing seems to be very fast also although I think it will be slower in low light.  A full set of instructions come with the camera on a DVD.  Directions are complicated but I think new users just need to take their time and gradually familiarize themselves with its different options.  Some people mention that the flash has to be popped up to work while many cameras have the flash pop up automatically when needed.  I don't find this a problem.  If I want to use flash, I pop it up and the camera will only use it if necessary.  If I don't want flash at all I leave it down and the camera will not use it.  The viewing screen is very bright and clear outdoors in bright sunlight, which can be a problem for many similar cameras.  This camera has about five different brightness settings for the display and I set mine to the brightest.  Even with the sun shining over my shoulder directly on to the screen I could clearly see the picture.  For years I have been using bigger and more complicated digital cameras.  Before that, for many years, I have used everything in film photography from 1/2 frame 35mm to 8X10 view cameras.  I am really happy with this little camera and think it is the perfect choice for me.  It has many different options if I want to use them but it is also an excellent point-and-shoot camera with a very long zoom lens.  Because of its small size, this little gem is really easy to carry around without the need for large, heavy camera bags.  I bought this camera in bright red to satisfy the Walter Mitty side of me.  I really think anyone looking for a great, little all-around digital camera for almost all photography will be very happy with this camera.  Just be sure to give yourself and the camera a break and don't expect to be familiar with every aspect of the camera in a few minutes.  This is true with any digital camera.

Worked well on my Olympus VR-340 that I replaced this camera with.  However, on the SZ-12, those features I loved on the VR are a real bummer.  They don't work.  Pet scene - camera focuses on whatever it sees first and snaps the pictures before you even have a chance to aim it at your pet.  Does reduce the \"green eye\" you get from pets but be ready to point and aim fast to get the picture you want.  Sunset doesn't work that swell either.  I've had the most luck using auto or landscape.  I liked that this camera had a better zoom that was reached farther than the VR-340 even though I was not gaining higher mega-pixels.  I was actually going down in pixel size vs the newer VR camera model has to offer.  THe zoom does work well and does make for nice clear shots.  At the same time, be a super steady hand because it does waver badly until it steadies itself.  In all, its a great camera for better zoom but the pile of scene features stink because they do not work no where near as well as promoted.
