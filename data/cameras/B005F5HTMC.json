First the product is extremely flimsy, and I highly doubt that I would last even a week. Second, we cant get the thing to turn on. We've tried two different sets of batteries, but can't get it to even flicker. I tried installing the software in my computer, to see if it has to be registered or something prior to use, but not the case.Don't bother with the product and instead invest in something else, so as to not have a sad and expectant child.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "2.1MP digital camera\n1.5-inch TFT preview screen\nThe rubberized design makes it easier to grip than an average camera and makes the edges feel less jagged\nSocial networking software lets you share your memories easily and fast\nThe sports rubberized design lets you play hard and still capture all the big moments", "Name": "Nerf 2.1MP Digital Camera With 1.5\" TFT Preview Screen, 25056", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41d0legzAhL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005F5HTMC"}}
