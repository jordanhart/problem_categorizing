{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Try a \"next to new\" model", "Author": "Fiddlesticks!", "ReviewID": "R2798RII0VDOE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband has the black Sony 30V and loves it.  When I've tried to use it, it's hard for me to read the dials as the contrast on the black camera exterior is lost.  This Sony 50V silver model restores the contrast with the buttons and dials.  I won't go into a review of the camera itself as you can find that on the black models.  Before I ordered this silver model, I called Sony directly.  The spokesperson confirmed that there was originally a silver model made/sold but it is sold out at the Sony site.  With some trepidation, I decided to take a risk on a camera that was slightly \"used\" but listed in excellent condition. It was sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals.  There was supposed to be a 1/4\" x 1/4\" scratch on the front of the camera.  When it arrived, my husband and I both looked and can't find it.  The tags were still on the camera, the box contained all the listed items.  The camera looks new.  The box itself has a few indentations. I imagine someone ordered the camera, checked it out and decided on a different camera for their needs then sent this one back to Amazon. The return policy is extended to the end of January so I have ample time to find the supposed damages...if they are there. The 125 dollars that I saved is so worth it! If any problems arise, I'll update this review.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Charles Mathews", "ReviewID": "R36U3MSG24YD28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great for manual and automatic shootingVery good for all types of lightingNice wide-angle and zoomFlash is very good", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.99", "Features": "20.4MP BSI Exmor R CMOS Sensor\nBIONZ Image Processor\n30x Optical Zoom Lens; 24-720mm Equiv.\n3.0\" 921k-dot Xtra Fine LCD\nFull HD 1080/60p AVCHD Video Capture\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi and GPS\nOptical SteadyShot Image Stabilization\n10 fps Shooting at Full Resolution\nFull Manual & Dedicated EV Control Dial\nMulti-Interface Shoe and Pop-Up Flash", "Name": "Sony DSC-HX50V 20.4MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Screen (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vcQk4gQ9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CHLW7N8"}}
