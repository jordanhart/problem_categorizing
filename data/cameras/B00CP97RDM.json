I opted for this camera instead. It was perfect for a small point and shoot and I loved all the auto modes. I don't want to spend a long time messing around with settings. I have rides to ride and characters to greet. At the end of the day you are paying for a decent point and shoot camera, and that is exactly what you will get.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A mediocre camera fitted with decent glass", "Author": "Bob Clark \"Frustrated gadgeteer\"", "ReviewID": "R1FOINDXXSI33H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I chose this camera as an impulse buy. The box said all the cool stuff: 1080p video, 18x optical zoom, 18.1 megapixel sensor, etc. I thought the price was a little higher than it was worth but I bought it anyway.This camera does not have a PASM control. Instead it tries to automate as much as possible. In other words, this is marketed as a foolproof camera. The problem is the camera is a bit slow in making up it's mind. It eventually sorts out the lighting and kind of gets the scene setting correct. Unfortunately the images tend to be overexposed. The green of vegetation is too light and the sky is blown out. Tree branches tend to be splotches in the background. On the 3\" screen the image looks OK, but put them on a large screen and all the errors appear in their glory.The camera has an HDMI interface, but I think it needs an HDMI cable that has a \"D\" end. And that's not supplied in the box. Sigh. The cable that is supplied uses the old white, red, yellow video and audio connectors.The camera lacks GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi. For some people that will be a plus because those energy draining radios aren't there to, uh, drain energy.Documentation for the camera is not much better than \"here, push some buttons and figure this out.\" So yeah, it's controls are simple enough to figure out. Give yourself a few hours to play with the camera and you'll figure it out.Recharging this camera should only be done with the supplied power adapter. I would not use another charger that had a USB interface. For example, don't use an iPad charger.I don't know if the supplied software is any good. My computer already has a good image management and editing solution so the software supplied by Nikon was redundant for my use case.The camera has an HDR mode that kind of works for short range images. Basically, if the scene is outside the flash's range HDR may or may not work. Of course, after the shutter finished the camera takes about 10 seconds to compose the image and write to the SD card.Ultimately, the S9400 is a set of compromises that creates a predictably \"could have been better\" experience.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "takes great pictures", "Author": "Ducky", "ReviewID": "R326HEMCKGQK79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gave this as a gift to my daughter - she is doing a study abroad in London.
