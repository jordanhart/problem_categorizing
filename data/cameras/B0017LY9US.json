I have purchased 2 and am going to buy another just to have 1 at work , 1 at home, and 1 for trips where I don't want to risk the 300 dollar camera.if you can't figure out how to download pix from your cell phone to the web(like me) this is the camera for you.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "terrible!  basically useless", "Author": "Fred", "ReviewID": "R34K4GJG6VRYDE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son for Xmas and it turned out to be basically useless since I could not download connect the camera to my computer using the USB cable provided and therefore could not download any pictures.  Although I made several attempts, the camera caused the port to power surge and I would need to reset my port to avoid damage to my computer.As if that it is not bad enough, the menu is hard to navigate and the documentation is poor.  Frustrating waste of money.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Young kids love these.", "Author": "Frank Kowalski", "ReviewID": "RXFDRUDLTP9QY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kids love these, and I have seen them actually make movies using clips from the camera and Windows Moviemaker.  It also works as a webcam if you can load the drivers, pretty well.  Adults love them too.  Easy to use.  Note there is a small lens to aim and shoot picture, not a screen in back.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "Mary K Garrett", "ReviewID": "R158BSTLLM1QSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They work very well for the price that you pay for them and kids love thema good little starter camera", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Similar to a pencil", "Author": "Led", "ReviewID": "R4IFJUPBVFC69", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This to me is like the pencil of the photography world.  Extremely simple to use,  no extra features, and good enough to let your imagination run wild if you truly let it.  I have had two of these and they work very well for the price that you pay for them.  The quality of photos that they take are similar to disposable cameras, so it all depends on how good you are at actually doing photography.  They are also good for quickly capturing a moment because the time between turning the camera on and taking the photo is very short.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to the ultimate point and shoot enthusiast.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Novelty Mini Camera", "Author": "Richard La Barca", "ReviewID": "RJEPDHO8ZFQL9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is about what you would expect from a limited cmos processing lens camera. It takes reasonable daylight photos although still limited clarity and small size. The resolution is about 1/3 of 1MP (~300000). Don't expect any indoor shots to be worthwhile without lots (and even more) light on the subject. As for a web camera, NOT! Overall, this is a fun novelty camera with some interesting photo software to play around with the pictures you would normally delete and throw away. Have Fun!", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "The pictures are terrible.", "Author": "daleen", "ReviewID": "R1ZFGRUTQNTFY4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes it is easy to use but the pictures are very blurry and poor picture quality even in high res.

I always wanted a keychain camera (why not?) and this was as cheap as it gets.If you have ANY expectations of good quality, you're just kidding yourself if you get this.  It takes short soundless video, has a continuous shot function, and includes a 10 second self-timer.  That's more than I expected with this little guy.  Of course, the photos are grainy as heck.It's fun to have on you at all times if you do not mind low-res photos.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Terrible!", "Author": "Cammi/Horse Lover", "ReviewID": "R29WB87VE9MEWF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these from CVS for $10 and decided it was only $10 why not. In the package there wasn't a cd or any thing to put in my computer for software. When I put a battery in all that showed up on the screen was numbers. The only screen on the camera was on the front. Also you pop up a see through slide that was plastic. None of the vivitar cameras have worked well. Don't even think about it.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Micro camera", "Author": "Dale Ray Gardner", "ReviewID": "R1ILY2JRP61MVH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is simply not worth the hassle needed to get a photo out of it.

Unfortunately, there wasn't a battery in it, so I went out and bought one, thought I had the correct type of USB for it (but didn't).
