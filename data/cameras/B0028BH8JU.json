The image quality on the screen and on the computer was very poor and quite distorted.  I called Sakar and they agreed to send us a replacement camera.  It took 3 phone calls and close to 6 months to finally get a replacement camera. The replacement had much better image quality, but then the button to take photos got stuck.  We weren't able to open the camera up to try and unjam it so now it is quite useless.  A complete waste of money.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Open package and Broken", "Author": "Julianne", "ReviewID": "R2IATWMOYQRAJ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was saving this for a christmas gift, but when I went to set the camera up, it was broken.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "2.1 MP Digital Camera\nPhoto editing CD\nUSB CAble\nWrist Strap", "Name": "Crayola 2.1 MP Digital Camera Scrapbooking Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BL9uxdW1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0028BH8JU"}}
