I got mine on black Friday for $79.99.  It takes great pictures, it's 10.3mp but shoots at 10.1mp.  Pictures are crystal clear, it is extremely easy to use, very very slim compact design with a massive screen, video capture is great and records in 480p high definition.  The zoom feature is amazing!  The pictures are great quality even when zooming all the way in.  I was on one side of my yard and my friend was about 20feet away and I used the zoom feature to capture a perfect face shot even from 20 feet away!  I am highly impressed with this camera, if you're debating I highly recommend it!", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Bad construction quality and low light photo", "Author": "Oceanlight \"bizowner\"", "ReviewID": "RH64NFSXP133H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It worked well for about three months but failed later. When we pressed the power on button, nothing happened anymore except the light blinked for a few seconds. We recharged it but didn't work. We had the same problem again with the replacement. I had a Fuji digital camera for years and it still worked. I won't ever buy camera from Kodak any more.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "kodak won't help", "Author": "Geoffrey R.

Takes inconsistent pictures at best.  Indoor shots are very dark and have to photoshopped to see faces.  Spend the extra money on another camera, this one was obviously a poor, over made design that Kodak trounced out on the cheap to get rid of.  I will never by another Kodak product in my life again!  They should be embarrassed by how bad the camera is.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Won't Focus Anymore", "Author": "Very Upset", "ReviewID": "R1FHQ22FW26573", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved this camera when I first got it back in 2008. I was 14 and took very good care of it. I always had it in its case when not in use. Despite my efforts, there are literally hundreds of little white specks of lint stuck to the back of the very first plastic screen. And I recently discovered that it won't focus anymore!!! It doesn't even try! When I zoom in, the camera shuts off even at full battery. The date keeps resetting, the dial at the top is always sticking. It's never been dropped either. The battery doesn't last long at all, 30 minutes tops. I don't recommend this camera today. Just save the money to buy a better and newer camera!", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stopped working after four months - not sure why", "Author": "Judi \"All hearts open, all people connected\"", "ReviewID": "R1QNPMW1987QH2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was nice and easy - worked well. Suddenly it won't open the lens, putting in batteries does not help. Any ideas anyone? I suppose I could take it back to Target but such a pain.

It is an ideal point and shoot camera for those with a lower budget who still want great photographs", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera", "Author": "sbssis1", "ReviewID": "RNT0KRKD04RE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera for taking pictures and videos because with a memory card it does hold a lot. Also, battery life is nice plus it's rechargeable. Photo quality is good if you have a steady hand but I am a little shaky so get a lot of blurry photos. Also, if in dim light the photos come out dark which is frustrating. However, overall it is a really nice, compact camera with several great features.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Good In Low Light Conditions", "Author": "J. Wagner", "ReviewID": "R3TR1OKQMQOYYN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like another reviewer, I purchased this from Target during Black Friday in 2008.  The camera takes great pictures -- as long as there is lighting.  I cannot get the camera to take good photos in low light conditions.  I have missed getting photographs of many occasions now due to them being in low light.  You take a picture and basically you get a solid black picture.  Very upsetting.  Researching to get another one this year.  Other then in low-light situations, I have been very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended", "Author": "J.
