{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Fuji s5 Pro isn't merely the D200's artistic bohemian brother", "Author": "Joe Pennant", "ReviewID": "R16P13C2DW1NR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive owned the D200, and controls and build aside, these are two different cameras. Surprisingly, this camera's nearest competitor isnt the Nikon D200 - it is the Canon 5D. Of course, the Canon clearly bests the s5 on resolution as it should. But that's it. The Fuji gives up little else to the Canon 5D but speed.However, since the obvious comparison is between the s5 and D200, the s5 is clearly superior to the D200 on image quality, particularly right out of the camera. In speed of operation however, the D200 leaves the s5 in the proverbial dust. The Nikon D200 is sure and fast, very fast. Like all the latest digital Nikon's, they will keep shooting for extended periods. However, the images demand you tweak the camera and do copious amounts of post-processing. The Fuji is more deliberate. It is fast enough to get out of its own way and get the shot and as well as the next, but not fast enough to keep shooting under demanding conditions, at which the Nikon excels. It isnt that the s5 is sluggish, it is that the Nikon is just so fast.However, once you understand the reason for this relative slowness, you can deal with it. Again, it's all about the images.The Fuji will produce stunning images from RAW files. It will do beautiful images straight from the camera. If you are a JPEG shooter and hate processing images on the computer, this is the camera for you.Although the metering is very, very accurate under all but the most backlit conditions, it has a tendency to underexpose the images in anything less than sunlight, so exposure compensation is a must. The good news there, is that unlike most other cameras Ive used, where exposure compensation can be hit or miss - or thoroughly ineffective, compensation is even and responsive. This keeps me from having to fiddle with metering options trying to get the proper exposure. A seriously underrated feature of the camera.Before the v1.06 firmware update, I was not impressed with the Automatic White Balance, having to constantly change the custom white balance, particularly with street lighting or ANY kind of flourescent lighting. Charged-gas lighting would give a nasty yellow or green cast to the images. After the update, the AWB is stunning, able to handle almost any lighting thrown at it. Since the update, I rarely touch the white balance settings. I simply dont have to. Amazing.Also, before the update - the images would go \"Blue\" under strong light and deep shadows, with a deep magenta-ish cast at night. After the update, that tendency has been minimized and the images are far better balanced - giving that true Fuji color without overdoing it either way.If you get a unit without the latest firmware, upgrade it at once. Period. This update gives me the camera I expected out of the box.So, the good news: The images are worth every penny you pay.The only way I can put it - standard, out of camera images often look like HDR images with unreal detail in both shadows and highlight. When you get that characteristic glossy look from a shot, you will involuntarily gasp.More good news: For low light images, this camera is nothing short of amazing. I shoot primarily at night and in low light, and I rarely, almost never - shoot above ISO 1250. I have shot (using a f/2.8 17-55mm Nikkor) at ISO 2000 in near darkness, and the images came out as if I had studio lights with VERY little noise. And thats another thing, noise is near nonexistent on the vast majority of my images, and what there is has a nice even film-like grain, not blotchy or nasty as you would see on a D200 shooting above ISO 400.However, all this goodness comes at a price. The high quality images are HUGE. A JPEG file set at the highest quality (FINE) takes up 5 - 7 megs. A RAW file averages 25 megs. This is why the camera doesnt feel as fast as the Nikon, as it is transferring massive amounts of data through the buffer to the card. You will start looking for large and very fast CF cards as well as upgrading your storage in short order.The camera is expensive compared to the D200, but it is definitely worth the premium if you demand the highest quality images. To bring out the best in this camera, you need the highest quality lenses. It is also murder on sloppy camera technique, so be sure to avoid shake.In all good conscience, I cannot rate the camera as 5 stars, but it is definitely a 4.5 - 4.75, even at the price.If I had to choose between the D200 and S5, the S5 wins hands down. In fact, I would get a D2Xs as a speedy backup to this camera, not the D200. My wish would be if Fuji decided to put this sensor and technology into the body of a D2Xs. Then Id probably give it 5 stars.-----------(Edit)So, after 5 months and 35,000 images later...For image settings I dont fark around with the film simulation modes anymore - too unpredictable. And confusing, frankly.I leave the DR on Auto, as the camera is pretty intelligent about when to apply it..I leave the Color on High. Bring the tone up.I also up the in camera sharpening, which is something I normally avoid. It helps overcome the noise reduction detail loss, and whatever sharpening algorithm they use, it definitely helps the apparent clarity of the images while keeping artifacts to a decided minimum..White balance - except for yellow walls under energy saving bulbs and outdoor charged gas lighting, I pretty much leave it on Auto. On the latest firmware - it totally handles everything else. Amazing.As far as camera operation, like the D200 - I find it is critical to learn how to use the AF modes - otherwise you'll sometimes want to blame the camera for focusing issues. Dont just leave it in one mode and forget it.While shooting under intense situations, keep an eye on the \"R\" (remainder) number. On the D200 its easy to ignore this. On the s5, you want to keep an eye on it as it tells you the state of your buffer. The camera is fast and responsive until you fill the buffer, then it locks up until the buffer clears.Ease up on the machine gunning when you see the \"R\" figure hits the \"r02\" level, for at \"r00\" it will lock.Oh yeah! Tape down the pin caps on the body. Otherwise, you WILL lose them.Also carried over from the D200 is the dreaded and unpredictable DBS - Dead Battery Syndrome. Sometimes in the middle of shooting, the camera will lock up and the battery indicator will flash as if its dead.This usually happens with the SB-800 flash and some Nikon AF-S lenses.Turning the camera on and off when this happen may alleviate, but the trick is to turn off the camera, hit the lens release button and twist the lens in the mount back and forth. That helps with the electrical contacts and keeps this behavior to an annoyance.What else? Oh yeah - learn to navigate through the menu and know where everything is. The logic is weaker than the Nikon menus, but there is a certain logic to it. That is the main learning curve issue with this camera.And if you buy an external flash, get into the flash menu and configure it to work properly with the flash, or you will get unpredictable flash performance.That's all I can think of right now. Im still learning this camera myself. :)----------After 15 months and 130,000 shutter actuationsThe v1.09 firmware update has pretty much elminated my complaints on sharpness.I rarely shoot RAW, as the SOOC images are pretty much spot on.There is a tendency to back focus shooting blindly, the focusing system needs a deft touch.That said, this is still a stunningly capable camera, highly recommended for those who value image quality to a high degree.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera for people and portraits", "Author": "James Hatsis \"AHR\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q9AFD2MYVOA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Nikon D200 already but after reading about this camera I decided to buy it.

I've been playing with SLR's and a few DSLR's since the mid 1980's. I've taken night classes in digital imaging and all the other related stuff so I'm somewhat familiar with photography. I've wanted to see what all the \"5 stars,\" super reviews, etc. was going down with the Fuji S5 Pro. A neighbor of mine opted to for-go his purchase of a D300 and buy an S5 Pro....I told him \"are you nuts!!\" From 3 months of his S5 Pro he showed me a number of people, nature, and landscape shots. I asked how much PP he did to them and he assured me....\"nothing, not a thing.\"The portraits looked better than professional, the landscapes looked postcard ready, and the nature shots were stunning. Granted, every photographer does not use the same settings and techniques, and of course there are variables to everything you compare, but I couldn't figure how he shot such unrealistic, beautiful images right out of the camera. After much debate, I took the plunge and got one. I damned near became obsessed with learning as much as I could and practiced on almost everything I could. After about 2 months.....NOW...IMO REAL WORLD REVIEW:1. The dynamic range, color, low noise/high ISO and detail is really remarkable.2. I like the familiar, solid D200 \"feel\" about the camera.3. \"Fast\" (fps) is something one must determine based on applications;  Weddings, portraits, walkaround, etc.....yes, following child down a soccer field with finger held down on shutter release....no.4. Big RAW files yes, but tolerable with a 4-8MB CF card. Transferring files to your PC needs a bit of patience even with a big PC.5. Reputable company (Fujifilm), contender in the DSLR market, good product support...no brainer.6. Good glass...a must.. cheap-out and the S5 Pro outputs garbage (I've tried this with a borrowed lens).7. \"Good photos come from good photography\"...true to an extent, having and learning with the right gear to obtain \"good photos\"...more realistic.My Summary: My goal is to achieve the best image quality from the camera  that I've spent my hard earned money as possible. Looking  exclusively on buying the S5 Pro for \"application\" purposes can be very subjective (IMO). The Fuji S5 Pro works for me as my \"all around\" camera. Will I sell my D200? Do I now need 2 cameras?...Soon time will tell. Do I like what I see from the S5 Pro....absolutely!!!", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Was a very good low light camera", "Author": "Christopher K. Seid", "ReviewID": "RIFXUPLXFNAPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the Nikon D70, D200 and currently still have the D80, D300 and Fuji S5. If low light photography is your cup of tea...then this is a very good camera. It beats the D70, D80 and D200 (anything over ISO 800 on these cameras are pretty much useless). However, since the D300 has arrived, (not to mention the D3), it is no longer my favorite low light camera. The D300 performs better in this area. It is also faster in fps and has a much bigger and clearer LCD screen. However, the S5 images at ISO 800 and above do give a grainy film like quality, which make the photos look quite good.Dynamic range wise...i think the S5 is still better when set to 400%. If i had rated this camera back in Oct 2007, I would give it 5 stars. Since it is 2008 July, only 4 stars.The good: High Dynamic Range, Very good low light capabilities, well built, incorporates Nikon excellent wireless flash system, auto-iso, film like grain/noise at higher isoThe bad: slow, very very bad menu (absolutely horrible!), LCD images of photo all look blurry...low resolution LCD screen?, can only use Fujifilm batteries...so your nikon ones won't be compatible!", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fuji S5 Pro color", "Author": "Another Reader \"Another Reader\"", "ReviewID": "RZXFD506ORVKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the S5 pro for a little over a year.

I don't like the less sharp standard settings.  But what makes the Fuji chip special is the color.  It's dead on; rich, finely textured, true.  The design which mimicks the rods and cones of the eye works.  Period.  All the SLR's that have come out in the last 1 or 2 years are amazing.

I have since bought and sold a Nixon D200 that really disappointed me. When I have to take only one camera I leave the Canon D40 at home and take the Fuji S-5.The saddest time in digital photography came when Fuji decided to not continue in the Pro Digital market.

Sarma \"rssarma\"", "ReviewID": "R3PSGW4W9FGHAN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using DSLRs for 4 years now, but have primarily been an Olympus (four-thirds) user. I love the system for its lenses and feature packed bodies at lower price points. However, the one area where 4/3s always had an issue was high ISO and DR; when I read about the S5 Pro, it seemed like the \"magic bullet\", resolving both these issues at once.For starters, I used the camera for a month and compared it to my Olympus E30 to see if I was really gaining anything substantial. After much assessment I decided to keep my E-30 and sell off the S5 Pro. Without belabouring the point, let me get down to the pros and cons,PROS:1. Excellent build quality2. Great ergonomics3. Phenomenal DR in JPEGs and highlight headroom in RAW files.4. Very nice and pleasing colours.5. WB is generally very accurate.CONS:1. High ISO noise is no better than the Olympus E-30.2. Noise reduction in JPEGs is very aggressive.3. Resolution is not equivalent to 12MP, the E-30 easily bests it.4. Colours and skin tones, although pleasing are more suited to Caucasian skin.5. Menu system is very complicated.6. Playback and image zoom require too many button presses.7. Battery life is low.8. If DR is left on 'Auto', the camera slows down.9. RAW files too large and best used with native software only.10. Native software doesn't support DNG.Olympus fixed a lot of issues with the E-30 and it really shows when comparing it to the S5 Pro; yes, the S5 has phenomenal amounts of highlight headroom that the E-30 can never come close to, but this is useful only when you constantly shoot in very high DR scenes or get the exposure wrong (overexpose).In terms of colour, I think both the E-30 and S5 are neck and neck, although when using higher ISOs, the E-30 seems to retain colour better. This seems to happen because of the fact that as you ramp up the ISO, after a certain point the R pixels are turned off and only the S pixels are used. Also, this variance in colour is more visible when using a RAW converter other than Hyper-Utility or Finepix viewer, clearly the S5 is best used only with it's native software. This is a big minus for me as I use LR for all my cataloguing and RAW processing.The S5 files are uncompressed and huge, so they are best managed when converted to DNG, however this means neither Hyper-Utility nor Finepix viewer can process these files for you. Also, when processing files in LR, the colours vary a lot from ISO to ISO, which means, if you plan on using LR/ACR, you are better of building your own colour profiles for different ISOs under different lighting conditions, this is a tedious affair.To summarize, the S5 Pro is a camera that offers superior highlight headroom, DR and colours straight out of the box and is an excellent tool for photographers that don't like spending too much time processing and colour correcting RAW files. However, in my opinion, the unmatched highlight headroom in the RAW files is the only thing which differentiates the S5 from today's cameras. Cameras like the Olympus E-30 produce excellent colours, good DR and are getting better at high ISO as well. Also, when you consider the bloated selling price of these cameras, it only makes sense to consider more current options in the market which may serve you just as well or maybe even better.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks like it is now officially discontinued.", "Author": "Anton Karidian", "ReviewID": "R1BSG90N12VKRJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Much improved over the previous version S3 Pro in terms of ease of use.The larger display screen is nice and the menu is much improved.Although the AA batteries of the previous version had its advantages, I prefer the lithion ion battery system of this version.The actual results is not that much of an improvement -- pixel count and ccd sizes remain the same.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "My S5 Pro", "Author": "Jeffery B.

Let me just put it in one phrase, the skin tones are AMAZING, and the colors, dynamic range and highlight recovery power is just UN-BE-LI-VABLE!  I don't care if you put a D800 beside it, yes, the camera is not for indoor low light or for high resolution, but the Fuji wins in the skin tone department, hands down!

This camera when shot in RAW and put together with LightRoom4 is unbeatable, and the colors are just wonderful and contrasty.

I searched ALL OVER the place for an S5, i have gone to camera shows where they sell tons of used equipment, and NOBODY had a single S5 camera. This camera is very difficult to get.Yes, when shooting outdoor you HAVE to be careful not to over expose the photo too much.  You would do the EXACT same thing if you were using ANY camera.  Is best if you shoot in RAW, but even in jpegs software will definitely help.  I completely disagree with some reviews bellow, it is preferable to over expose instead of under exposing(this way you avoid noise also) then in PP you get way better photos when you lower brightness, and BOOM!!

Cook", "ReviewID": "R3S3Z6LMYHR0GS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have tested this camera for three weeks now. I can only compare this to Canon 40D. The primary reason I bought S5PRO was the dynamic range. The secondary reason was the vivid color.The dynamic range and the film simulation mode are only available when you shoot in JPEG. When you set to RAW, the picture quality is the same as Canon 40D shot in RAW.  I found out this very important point only after wasting a lot time and comparing the shots with Canon 40D (reviewers don't make this clear). In other words, I am inclined to say if you normally shoot in RAW like I do, you don't need to pay extra for this camera.Excellent dynamic range and vivid color WHEN YOU SHOOT IN JPEG only (a lot better JPEG image than that of Canon 40D in comparable pixels). When you shoot in RAW, the picture quality seems comparable to other RAW shots taken by Canon 40D except S5PRO takes a lot more pixels (20 MB) vs Canon (9 MB).**********UPDATE (EXPOSURE) **********************After testing this camera over a month, I have concluded (to my distress) that this camera is very difficult to get the right exposure when shooting outdoors. You are likely to end up with OVEREXPOSURE.  When the metering is set to DYNAMIC (the middle one), which is supposed to intelligently figure out overall light, the end result when viewing on the computer monitor is about ONE STOP OVEREXPOSURE.  Don't rely on the look on the camera screen.  When it looks just right on the camera screen, DECREASE the exposure by ONE STOP.  So it is best to set EV value to -0.7 EV under all circumstances if you don't want to adjust the exposure every time.You must also keep in mind that when this camera is overexposed, you don't get the benefit of the deep/rich legendary FUJI COLOR. When overexposed (say one stop) the picture simply looks BAD beyond repair.********UPDATE (OUTDOOR DYNAMIC RANGE)**************When shooting outdoors where the lighting contrast is strong, you lose the details of the dark (the highlight looks excellent though).  Where is the acclaimed dynamic range of this camera?  Obviously, it does not work all the time.*******UPDATE (EASE OF CONTROLS)**********************Folks, the design of camera is clumsy, PERIOD. Believe me it is like using a FILM CAMERA>CONCLUSIONAfter a month-long test of this camera, I am inclined to believe this camera is ideal for indoor studio portrait or carefully orchestrated outdoor shooting.
