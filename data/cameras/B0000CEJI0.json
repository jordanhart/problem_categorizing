Robinson \"bobshell5\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z4I5PCGK9A9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This would be the perfect camera for most, if only it had a focus assist light.  Noise if very high for indoor shots, epecially if you leave it on auto.  This is a camera that requires you know alot about iso, focusing methods (such as spot focusing) and setting the contrast (this camera uses a contrast focusing system).  The less light you have, the longer it takes to focus.  Shutter lag is excellent for daytime, outdoor shots, and much slower with low to moderate light. Due to Olympus using a contract TTL system, adjusting the contrast to -1 really helps, as well as setting the metering to spot.  Also setting the sharpness to -1 helps with noise.  A flash is a must for indoor shots, provided you can get the camera to focus lock.  A bigger xD card is a must...The 5060 is a much better camera, but costs $...more.", "Date": "November 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Terrific little camera", "Author": "thevicarofdibley", "ReviewID": "R3M0VY0G4ASD0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality of this camera is something to behold. I read of people saying the camera gives noisy pictures and all but they're probably using their camera with the settings at default. Set the sharpness to -2 and the aliasing and sharpening artifacts just disappear! You end up with rich and highly detailed pictures worthy of the 5MP tag. The colour that this camera gives is simply beautiful. I have found the FL-20 flash to be a very good match as well. This small unit balances nicely with this camera and lends a lot more oomph to strobe lighting needs. Yes, it's not a perfect camera: no low light focus beam (though the camera still focuses quite well in lowish light situations - you can also just switch to manual focus if you need and just guesstimate distance to subject); no histogram (I don't use it much anyway) and no sound with movies. But the goodies especially the picture quality outweighs the bads: Li-ion battery (very good battery life), good usable ISO range from 50, 80 ,160 (320 is as expectedly noisy), lightweight and small size, good manual exposure range (A/S), etc.If you're after very high picture quality, pictures that have great detail (without that almost over smooth \"Canon look\") and colour, this is a terrific option for the money.", "Date": "May 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1J85IY4M64O8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with a lot of features at a very reasonable price.  The camera is very easy to use, has great battery life (I took 75 pictures over a week w/ flash on one charge), and produces excellent pictures.  I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about with the colors.  Maybe they should learn how to operate the camera or get their vision checked?  The color looks perfect...better than a high quality film camera.  The software that comes with the camera is adequate.  My only concern before buying the c-5000 was with the xD memory format, which I had never used before.  It has worked better than I had hoped. The camera writes to the card very quickly and the camera is able to hold over 200 images at the highest resolution on the extra 256mb card I purchased.

I was going to Europe and I wanted Digital, but I'm a broke student.  I wanted something that would be good for awhile, but wouldn't put me completely in debt.  Technically, I am still paying this off, but it was totally worth it.Great quality.  I can take a picture, zoom in on it, and still blow it up to 8 x 10 photo quality.  Plus, it's really easy to use.  I mean, it has all the little special features if you want them (and I wanted them), but if you don't, it's just point and shoot.  Then, plug in the attached cord to your computer, click the copy photos button, and you're ready to print or email or whatever.  And it doesn't have that \"waiting\" problem that you'll get with a lot of digital cameras.  It has all the positives of a 35mm and all the positives of a digital.  I am completely satisfied with my choice.If you're willing to spend a bit more, I'd still recommend staying with this Olympus series.

Paredes \"alzn\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZ61HL6R7AR4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is my second digital camera. my first is a refurbished 3 megapixel from Canon that was great at taking the instant snapshot. i had no exposure problems for that one for some reason. this Olympus on the other hand is great after some practice.In my case, I got this to shoot my school portfolio shots. i'm a graphic design student with okay photography skills but not a pro. So I required a bit of patience for composition and lighting. Its good enough to print big tabloid sizes on an epson at 200dpi (heavyweight matte) at the maximum tiff file size. The colors are great especially after you fight to get the right exposure at non-optimal conditions. But it took me like 1000 shots to get over the muddy exposures. (crash course in photography - lighting is king)On a sunny day its great. I like the manual controls though you can't save the settings completely and have to reprogram the thing. With the timer and tripod, the slow shutter speeds help for dark to night shots. I tried the nighttime mode and it was remarkable compared to say playing around with a manual film camera for the first time. the flash is adjustable and having a hot shoe helps for the glamour shots.Scrolling through all the menus and submenus are okay. I use a Canon G5 at work and its numerous buttons at first is intimidating but seems quicker access than this Olympus. Yet the scrolling on the C5000 is okay to use unless you are freaking out and rushing. Its better than the Canon in that it seems more logical as I didn't really study the manual in detail.Back to the controls, it has some good adjustable controls to hot rod your shots. I just wish it could stop down (or is it up?) to smaller aperature than F/8. The zoom is average range. But for some reason the super macro has great shots - probably because all the light is up close - compared to regular shots.Sometimes when you shoot dark shots there is some noise and speckles in the image dark areas even when you use noise reduction. And there is a somewhat vignette phenomena as well.Other good things about the camera: the various white balance controls helps alot; the camera starts fast. the controls are fast.Not so good things: transferring files is not so fast as the Canon G5 and its software. the included 16mb Xd card is a joke. waiting for the camera to reload after the 15 mb tiff file is saved is tedious.  you have to have a spare proprietary Olympus battery if you get carried away and run out of juice. no included hand strap.", "Date": "October 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a great price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3AUYISYHWHGNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera that is easy to use yet has advanced features if you want them.

After researching and test driving most major brands and models of 5 MP Digital Cameras recently, I kept coming back to the Olympus C-5000Z and simply could not pass up all the features of this camera when all was said and done. Especially at the price that I did not see even remotely matched by any of the other big brand manufacturer's. However, if size is an issue and a compact, lightweight camera is a priority, you will probably opt for something else. Auto feature allowed me to literally put the battery and memory into the camera, shoot pictures indoors and out, and download to my laptop, even email the photos to anyone in my address book - without one hassle or hitch. It does seem to do better in brighter or well lit areas versus darker, primarily indoor environments. I also learned when I went to purchase the camera there was a $50 manufacturer rebate available, effective through 3/30/04 (I believe)? The rebate and most every other basic feature necessary for the beginner-to-intermediate digital photographer, made the Olympus C-5000 Zoom extremely hard to pass up.

This model has loads of advanced shooting modes and features you will want to explore..including a panorama mode and a side-by-side picture mode.The ONLY shortcomings this model has are shutter lag (kind of sluggish by today's standards), less powerful optical zoom (I'd gladly trade the digital zoom for more optical power), and the movie feature really comes up lacking by contemporary standards (jittery, and no sound).But overall, the prices I see here on Amazon are a bargain.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "not so happy", "Author": "Crazyshopper", "ReviewID": "RSTECN17TYNZ7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The IR remote doesnt work.
