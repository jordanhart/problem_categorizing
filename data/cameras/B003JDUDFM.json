{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst piece of electronic junk", "Author": "J. Rayburn", "ReviewID": "R20VSIQDSTN0HX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this DVR for use in my vehicle. The user guide is quite poor in content and translation. The unit does not write data to the CF card that can be read by the card reader on my PC.  Able to view video on DVR but unable to view via the software provided from my PC. If one is unable to save the video then why have a DVR??? Poor customer support on the unit too.With issue on first DVR, that I could not save video, I returned the initial unit.  They still charged me a 20% restocking fee for a unit that did not work.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003JDUDFM"}}
