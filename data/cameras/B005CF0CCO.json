Night vision is OK, but has a bit of a dark ring around the outside where there isn't enough light from the LED's.  The mount is crap, there is no way to mount it from the top, only from the bottom or the back, and it doesn't hold well.  And what's with this awful color? Why would you make a security camera purple?", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent quality", "Author": "Denis Ayers", "ReviewID": "R3R9J1CVZTG308", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Only had it a few weeks but it's performing perfectly.

This Sony camera has performed by far the best of 8 cameras that I have tested for color, IR night vision, viewing distance, inside lighting, and price. Just ordered 6 more and sent the others back. I will update this review once I have them all in place and running for a few weeks.Update: March 26, 2013I finished evaluating 8 indoor/ outdoor security cameras and by far this Sony is the best overall all purpose camera when comparing the price, color with indoor/ outdoor lighting, IR night vision within 25 feet, and daytime viewing distance within 60 feet. I must mention a couple of things too. I now have 8 of these cameras, but I had to send 2 cameras back because of viewing defects. Since I was able to see how well they performed I knew immediately that I had two \"lemmons\" when I hooked them up. No problem with returning them to Amazon for a refund. The other thing is that the camera cases (purple), wires (black/ tan, and mounting brackets (black/ silver)are not all the same shade (camera housing), color (wires), or style (brackets) if that matters. Since I had 8 cameras I was able to pair them up so that the differences are not really noticeable.The higher priced cameras I evaluated ($60 - 90) had better long distance daytime viewing and sharper colors, but this Sony camera out performed them for IR quality within the 25 - 30 feet range I was looking for.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "shellbell", "ReviewID": "R3K6B2AKK729QP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is providing excellent coverage of my business-both day and night.It is a good choice for the price I paid.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R3BQYS1QPR3K2L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product exhibits a very cheap lenses system, as demonstrated by the distorted fish bowl image it displays. What drew me to this particular item was it's low light levels, which is of great importance to my application for security monitoring. Don't waste your money on this one, I've got to waste mine sending this piece of junk back for the ARM item and I suppose a restocking fee.
