If one downloads the complete manualthey will not have any problems using it.  The pictures that it takes are razor sharp and I had no blurred pictures.  Most of the complaintsof blurred pictures are mostly due to not pushing the shutter button halfway in order to set the focus first before finally taking thepicture.  The camera itself is quite small (shirt pocket size) and the finish of the body is very glossy.I love this camera!The included case, memory card and battery, and other accessories are so worth the purchase of this bundle compared to the camera only!", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great quality!", "Author": "Mandy C. from Tennessee", "ReviewID": "R2LG8T2KOJGUKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this on my wishlist for some time now and finally it came into the price range I could afford! I was very pleased when it arrived the very next day! (purchased thursday morning arrived friday afternoon at 4:00pm) It came with all listed parts and was very easy to set up and use. Other then the fact it takes a micro sd card which it did come with an adapter for. I love the fact that it has a wall charger so when I travel theres never the fear of running out of batterys. It also takes superb pictures and is very easy to use and customize. I'm glad that I finally made the purchase and also the fact that it came with 25 free prints helped also! :)", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Redeemed", "ReviewID": "R1JQEVW2483RHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera was shipped much quicker than I expected.

My previous camera is a kodak too but takes double AA batteries and it really eats those batteries up. This one has a lithium battery that last a whole lot longer and the camera is slimer too.

I should have bought this first instead of straying to a different brand.This is the second Kodak point and shoot. I took my first point and shoot everywhere from skiing the back country to riding on wave runners. After 4 seasons of snow skiing and carrying it in my leg pocket I think the moisture finally had it's way. I cracked the display screen two years ago but it still took great pictures until it would not turn on anymore.I thought I would go with the name of camera that has for years stood for quality and status. That was a mistake. I had charging problems with the camera within 30 days and when I returned it the company would not honor the warranty siting \"Customer Misuse\". Thankfully the extended warranty I purchased through Square Trade made the return without any problems and refunded my money.My previous Kodak was a trooper so why not take a chance.

They lost film cameras, cameras I thought highly competitive where they were selling. They did a good job on themselves with the advent of electronic digital cameras, they stuck with the chrome films and went bamkrupt, instead of being leaders in the field. And yet I liked their cameras, from look and shoot, up a little higher to computer control with point. pick controls, then click and shoot. They made good cameras im the lower end, I preferred them to Nikon,Canon, Fuji, Olympus, and other cameras at the beginning and on into the intermediate level, they had many good features. They had high optical values, high pixel count, several different modes for shooting with high values realized, and all at competitive pries. These features were all competitive or even better, as well. I do not have many Kodak cameras, only two, the Kodak Easy Share C913 and Easy Share M583. I got the C913 to lrarn how to use the digital camera, the other two cameras, Canon S3IS and Nikon D40X, were too complicated for me, I was a film user for 60 years and had to start from scratch, as bad as the Kodak company for thinking electronics could not catch up to optics. fool that I was. Well, the C913 should have taught me. What has happened since shows where electronics can go, and there is still room to grow.The M583 shows the C913 the way, just look at pixel count! I think there are only about two years between them but Kodak, for some reason, has backed out. It is still possible to find some Kodaks as surplus, try, the price is right for such high quality.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Kodak M583 Digital Camera, Value Bundle kit w/ Case, 4GB Card, Rechargeable Battery, Charger (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Rmh1CpI%2BL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0075814SC"}}
