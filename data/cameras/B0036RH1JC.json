The first one I received had a broken USB port and would not download pictures.  I was able to return it and get a replacement.  After using this camera for a while, I would say it can be very frustrating to use.  The picture quality is very good but it can take a very long time between pictures in some situations.  At seemingly random times after a picture is taken, the green light will blink for up to 30 seconds at a time.  When the camera is processing, you cannot take another picture or view previously taken pictures.  This can be extremely frustrating when trying to take a family or group photo.  30 seconds is way too long.  Most other cameras I have used (including my 5 year old Fuji) take less than 1 second to process a picture.  It doesn't happen every time but at least 50% of the time it will take 10 or more seconds between shots.The camera is very configurable and I have tried many different settings without much luck.  I have also tried using a different brand of memory card with limited success.  About the only thing I can determine is that it may be related to the facial recognition feature.  My latest attempt to speed things up was to disable facial recognition in the camera settings.  This seems to have worked but I have thought that before only to have the problem come back.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "the best compact PaS camera ever!!!", "Author": "Kennan Chiang", "ReviewID": "R2MSWQHEB347L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take to Shanghai for the World Expo 2010, I needed something that has a wide angle, good night shots, and HD video mode.  After I going back and forth b/w this one and Canon's, I decided to give it a try.  This camera absolutely shoots some of the best pics I have seen.  Even better than my father's Nikon P100 during the night!  HD video is good too.  Zoom is responsive and start up is fast!  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but these 2 minor things really bugged me.  Battery life sucked!!!  I was pretty much on 14mp all the time, and the battery only lasted for about 150 shots.  Another thing is very weird is that sometimes after first a few shots, it will take this camera literately 1+ minute to get the next shot ready.  I have missed a few shots because of that.One more thing needs to be mentioned.  I dropped the camera from a 6 feet tall bookshelf, landed on the solid wood floor.  It didn't even dent the case.  Everything still worked except when zoomed in, LCD started to have black spots on the LCD and photos.  So I didn't use zoom for last 2 days of the trip.  After I got back to the US, I called Samsung.  They sent me the return label, I returned the camera, got it fixed and shipped back to me within 1 week!!!  It's perfect now, this is what I call customer service!  I really love this camera, but I need to buy another battery for my next trip for sure.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely satisfied!", "Author": "jetstream", "ReviewID": "R3D28YR7WFQ4BG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung continues to deliver top notch products in the TL 110.  Excellent sharp lens delivers superb stills and the best video from a small digital camera I have yet seen (have about 15 digital cameras).  The micro SDHC card required was a suprise however but the software to upload pics and the HD video to my laptop worked fine.  Playback of both stills and video was excellent- the software converted the MP4 video to WAV and played back on Windows Media player also.  Great buy!!

Point and shoot cameras like these are meant to operate quickly.  You snap a photo, it saves, and then you go and snap another.  Forget about that with this camera.  The norm has become about 30 seconds of the light blinking before it will show you the photo you just took.  This is the most frustrating thing when you are trying to take pictures of people and they have to stand there and wait.  It's also frustrating when you are taking photos of a live event.  As for night shots, don't even bother trying.  Every night shot, even with the night shot option enabled, comes out blurrrrrry and grainy and very, very dark.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, but a little slow", "Author": "L. Pierson", "ReviewID": "R2XD7OW90LENH3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really wanted a compact camera that could fit in my pocket so I could take it everywhere.  This has a great small size.  I was pleased that it also takes pictures at 14.2 mp and has 5x optical zoom.  I really like the quality of the photos it takes, and it also has a great \"smart auto\" feature.  It's really good at recognizing close-ups, night photos, etc.  If the auto feature still doesn't give you what you want, you can go in and manually change the mode to suit your needs.  This worked well when we took a picture in front of our Christmas tree, but the snow outside the window was a little bright.  I just set the scene to \"backlight\" so that our faces wouldn't look so dark against such a bright background.  The photos turned out great!I only have two complaints.  It is a little slow at processing, so sometimes I have to wait awhile before I can take the next picture or even look at it.  It got to the point that my subjects were getting bored and wondering why I couldn't operate a camera.  My only other problem is that there's almost always red-eye.  However, it's hard to stop red-eye on compact cameras, so I guess I can't complain too much.  Red-eye is super easy and quick to edit on a computer, so it's worth it to me to have a compact camera where I have to edit the photos than to have a bulky camera that I won't carry around or take any photos.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice quality pics but too slow", "Author": "Judy L.", "ReviewID": "R2AV1RRC0CME9N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I like this camera.  I was looking for something inexpensive, compact and light to carry around in my diaper bag just in case.  The quality of the pictures is very nice- the 14 megapixels is definitely an improvement over the 10 MP I had prior on a much more expensive camera (at the time).  Outdoors, the automatic settings work beautifully.  Indoors, like most digital cameras, the flash overexposes the subject so that the background is too dark.  Turning the flash off is easy on this thing but then the pics come out mostly blurry.  My biggest gripe on this camera and why I took away 2 stars is the shutter speed (I think that's the right term).  Sometimes it takes 5 seconds for the camera to actually take the picture once you depress the button and it makes it impossible to take good pictures of my toddler.  It'd be ok if the subjects were adults and could hold still but you only have a second or two to capture something with children.  Also, the time it takes to process the pictures is much too long.  I haven't actually counted the seconds but it seems like 10+ seconds at times.If you don't plan to take pictures of kids and need something compact to carry around, then this camera will do the trick.  Otherwise, look for something faster.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera", "Author": "Crissie", "ReviewID": "RA60GB0SGXDIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung previously, and when it died, I knew I needed another camera.
