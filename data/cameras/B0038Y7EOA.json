I had to wait for the post man and then spend hours figuring it would not work as advertised. What did I do to you besides buy your seemly nice products? I was wrong.Why won't you'r files play on any of the current standard media players?Why don't you tell us what operating systems this works with?Why did you imply that a standard player should work, WRONG?I do like the remote control; very nice, but a wasted option cosidering the lack of an on board power supply to run the camera.Why don't you offer a CD with the icm.xvid codec, it's not standard with media players? I can't find a safe place to download it. At lesat offer on your web site that's so dam hard to find.Why don't you tell people the recorder must be on for the computer to see the device or contents of the SD card?Why not install a wide angle lense?Why is it so hard to find your web site? You can't even google it.Why don't you say anything about how long it takes to charge the DVR battery or how long that charge will last? Because they aint one, dummys. So why make us use a AA battery when it has to be pluged in any how DUMMYs?What is so hidden about info@securitymaninc.com ;a wall clock camera that has a cord comming from it? Any idiot can tell you modern quarts clocks use batteries, not a smart idea with the DC adapter. Geesh, spend some time and install a nice optional lithium rechargeble like the blue tooth headsets for true wireless function.Why do I get an invalid date error when I click save afterupdating time/ date and other settings? Why when set to low res, I still get an *mb file for only 44 secs of record time. Your hoping we just give in a set it to erase as needed or assuem it recorded nothing. Sorry!Why won't the camera record with USB conected?These are not complaints, it's feedback. I think you have a good start on your products; I like many of them. Regardless, if you can't get this simple clock right, I would be afraid to spend more money on some of your better stuff. It's clear your tech writers don't speak native English from the looks of your manuals; perhaps you have a job for me???I spent $200 and I think I should get my money back. As nice as it is, it's not what I was told it would be and that's why its sucks along with all the reasons I stated above.  Simply put, cheap! Don't forget to pay me when you upgrade my ideas into your products. I'm ok with 1099 but I would rather a check made out to cash please. Oh, one last thing, I did not get the wifi or transmitter clocks because that's not hidden either Dummys. It can be detected for just a few bucks, pennies compared to what you charge for the clock.webadmin@securitymaninc.co info@securitymaninc.co techsupport@securitymaninc.co sales@securitymaninc.co", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0038Y7EOA"}}
