{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor Performance", "Author": "Rotimi", "ReviewID": "R1XJGRBSGUVMVS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have this camera and was disappointed at its performance. It works well in direct line and less than 50 feet from the receiver, after which its quality deteriorates fast. Though its rated @ 300 ft, I could not get a picture @ more than 50 ft and even poorer picture with a lot of flickering @ more than 12 ft. For instance, I cannot use the camera from my attached garage, and no unusual obstacle in between. The accompanying power cable is too short to allow flexibity in location but you can buy an extention cable. Also, I still can't get the auto vcr recording to work. Night vision is poor, color is not so great.However, If you will be using it close to the receiver, its an excellent security camera for its price under $100.00. I like the trigger feature that beeps whenever a movement is detected.By and large if you know its limitations and are imaginative its  not a bad device to have. I am planning to get more around my house as the receiver can handle 4 cameras but I can't get to buy an isolated camera without another receiver. I don't know if its compatible with other 2.4ghz cameras.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "fuzzy at first then not even that!", "Author": "defective camera", "ReviewID": "R1U98RN1XO08Z3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had two other cameras like this one that vandals had destroyed but this one didnt work right out of the box. can I send it back and get a new one. now the other two worked just fine but not this one.
