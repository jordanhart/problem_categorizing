{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pay a premium for nothing", "Author": "Elsie Ann Lordem \"EAL\"", "ReviewID": "R1SIBH9UC337NC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing the Y-cam Knight SD camera -- what sold me on it was the claims (by the company, not users) of ease of set up for a mac.  I have a few wireless security cameras with my alarm.com account and it took a little rolling up the sleeves to get them to function including running XP on Fusion.  Furthermore, I was not to use this camera for home security, rather as a baby cam (so I wanted audio and video capabilities and I thought it would be nice to capture cute moments on an SD card).  There are a number of cameras that are markedly cheaper available and look exactly the same; Y-Cam claims their product and customer service are superior and that is what swayed me.  The camera arrived over a week ago but I have not had time to try to set it up due to the imminent arrival of twins.  Good thing this will be simple...think again.  First, Y-cam sent a nice CD with the camera.  Instructions promise that it will make set up straightforward and simple.  It is a blank cd.  I've tried it on three computers, nothing, nada, zilch.  Fair enough, this could happen to the best of companies-- let's go to the website and download it.  After following instructions and plugging the device into my wireless router again nothing.  So, mac owners you will need to get a crossover ethernet cable, change your computer's IP address, get off of your wireless connection, hardwire the camera to your computer.  Now unplug the camera and set up port forwarding on your wireless router using the data that you will take from having hardwired the device into your computer.  Unplug and restart everything and viola! You find you will have a discolored image with a three second lag time on your computer (to be fair, I understand that color can improve over time and the delay is to be expected for wireless cameras).  Now bring your camera from the living room into the babies' room (about 25 feet away) and...  no more wireless signal.  The camera has a range of about 15 feet with a line of sight to the router (for those interested the router is a Cisco Linksys E3000-- very good range for phones, sonos, other IP cameras-- just not Y-cam).In sum, this appears to be a very good baby monitor camera if you intend on having your children sleep on your wireless router.  The iPhone feature is nice (I got that running very quickly) and audio + video is good.  The Y-cam site allows you to call customer service in the UK for a mere .25 euro per minute (on top of whatever your long distance charge is).  God I hope I haven't waited to long and missed the opportunity to return this steaming piece of English crap.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overpriced for what it is", "Author": "Pete Webb", "ReviewID": "R3QDO9J1AG0D21", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Unfortunately the quality of this camera just doesn't match its price.It's cheaply made; feels flimsy, ball joint barely hold position. Worst yet the OS and web UI is complete crap. In its default config of 3 simultaneous steams the Camera is so busy transcoding that doing anything taxing in the web ui causes the camera to crash and reboot. On top of that the color in the video stream is just garbage day or night.I bought a Panasonic BL-C230A at the same time as this unit. The Panasonic is light-years ahead in quality of build, UI, and video + it is cheaper than the Y-Cam. The only thing the Panasonic doesn't do is night time IR recording.Anyway, beware of this Camera, it isn't worth $300+.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Security Cam But !", "Author": "Shirin M.

The support guy keeps asking the same questions even though its clearly included in my submission and can be reviewed by support.

Barton", "ReviewID": "R16N1MQHZ9Y71L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The good things are is does do what it says: IR, motion detection, email alerts, WiFi / ethernet connectivity, SD card recording, ftp of stills, remote access to settings.Camera: It's an IR / daylight camera with a IR lens so the colors are way off in daylight - they must have had complaints as they warn you about that on the box.WiFi: The signal strength on the WiFi was poor - other devices in the same location showed 100% yet the Y-Cam could only manage 50%.SD Card: Recordings usually had jerky motion with ling freezes and missing data.  This, in my opinion, is a critical failure as this is where data is should be stored when all else fails. When using the SD card you can no longer manange the internal buffer as it doesn't have enough memory to do both.Live viewing: The output often freezes. Maybe it's due to lack of bandwidth from the WiFi but it often stopped for several seconds usually when the action was happening i.e. just when you wanted it. Works well with IE. Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc will only give you MJEG support which demands more bandwidth.The mail alerts, motion detection ftp and remote settings worked very well - I was completely happy with those features.Basic set up was very easy. The web server setup was hard as the UPnP didn't seem to want to work with my AT&T; 2Wire router. I had to turn it off and use a manual port forward rule on the router. Support were no help with this nor did they get back to be on the SD card recording issue. If you're not willing to put in support ticket and wait several days, if they reply at all, then they do offer telephone support but I could not get it to work from here in the US and it would have cost about $0.40 a minute if I had.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent For Home Security", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R24RH0MIEW5LIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. Pretty good night vision, built in recording (no DVR needed) and accessible over the web. Although it's not quite the \"1-2-3 easy\" setup that the advertisement claims it's still pretty easy. The instruction manual is lacking quite a bit, but at least it's in plain language (not a bunch of technical jargon) and there is plenty of online content to aid with setup. Image quality is good and the camera is full of great features. The thing I like best about it is that you can choose between continuous video recording, motion recording, snapshots at regular intervals, snapshots on motion alarms or all of the above. It is also capable of sending alerts and recorded data to your email address if you don't have an SD card to use and web access is very easy if you already have a router. Oh, and there's also an inexpensive external \"shell\" that you can purchase which converts this camera to an outdoor unit... which I have purchased on a separate order.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Getting worse", "Author": "A Waheed", "ReviewID": "R3U44I0ULVP4X9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Further to my previous review, it took 10 days for Y-Cam to confirm that the Camera was faulty and they stated they will arrange for the collection of the faulty camera, and delivery of a new one on the same day or the day after.  3 days on, they now state that it was the fault of UPS, the couriers, who failed to do the exchange in the depot or something ridiculous like that.
