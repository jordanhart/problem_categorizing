{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The perfect camera kit for children", "Author": "Ernest Miller \"KingPin2012\"", "ReviewID": "R2KAY297L4PJSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Technology and I have a relationship built upon mutual respect. I take care of it and in turn, it takes care of me. However, this level of understanding is lost on our youth (or rather, hasn't fully developed). I often dread when my little cousins and nephews beg me to let them hold my iPhone or Asus Prime tablet knowing full well that something will go awry and I would be left to pick up the pieces. But I know how important technology is to children and they do need to learn how to use and respect it so that they can both grow together. That's when I saw this little treasure and knew I had to purchase it for my little nephew's 7th birthday.Without a doubt, this was his favorite gift of the day. He ripped it open with such ferocity as if the box itself was made with the very wrapping paper that contained it seconds earlier. The party seemed to stand still at that moment as he perused throughout all of the parts that came bundled with. This really is a complete set that comes with absolutely everything your child would need to get started in photography. The camera itself is extremely durable and has a decent weight to it. I could literally feel the strength of the material in the palm of my hands and was sure no matter how hard he tried, my nephew wouldn't be able to break it. It also includes a scrapbook and some markers to decorate it with inside and out. Even the most basic of scrapbooking materials are included: safety scissors, colored paper, and a glue stick. This really is the total package!While my nephew was taking snapshots of everything within sight, I installed and set up the bundled creativity software. It was very quick, simple, and intuitive. I'm sure my little nephew could have easily done it himself but he was a bit predisposed undergoing a creativity overload with his new camera.When the party ended, I stayed to help my nephew upload the photos he had taken. We put the camera in the provided plastic case and he immediately proceeded to drop it on the tile floor. I was a bit worried but the case was strong and the camera walked away without a single scratch. He turned it on just to be safe and took a shot of me marveling at the strength of the protective case. Then he plugged in the camera into the computer using the provided USB cable and the creativity software led us by the hand and worked its magic. It does so much more than upload the photos. There are games, puzzles, and even an editing suite that is simple enough for children to have fun but also has some really neat features parents would love to tinker with. For a 2.1 megapixel camera, it takes some rather sharp images. The quality was so good, I almost had a hard time believing my nephew took these himself.All in all, this was a great purchase. This camera is perfectly designed for children. The bright colors are more attractive to the standard silver/black and the handles on the sides are easy for kids to grip and hold the camera steady while taking pictures. It gives your kids a creative outlet while also teaching them how to use computers at a young age. It's been about a week already and my nephew can't stop taking pictures and playing with the software.If you're looking for a gift to give to the young loved ones in your family, this kit by Crayola has everything you need to get them started.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wish I had splurged for a REAL camera", "Author": "Marin Mommy", "ReviewID": "RBPEMP8UF5DJS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this as a b-day gift from my daughter when she turned 5.
