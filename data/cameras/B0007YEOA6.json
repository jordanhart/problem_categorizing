Brown \"fromshadowlands\"", "ReviewID": "R3NC9I4MC2YC2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my Canon D30 in favor of this more modern and lighter 300D. It's got 6.3MP compared to the 3.3MP I had with my Canon D30. I picked up my Digital Rebel for roughly $327 lightly used. NOT A SCRATCH!!! I'm in love with this camera. It does what I need it to do. Photos are coming out in vivid kindness, even with my econo lenses. It's very light compared to my Canon D30. Yes, it's \"plastic\", but the build quality is sold and you wont even complain about it.The only reason I mentioned that it's almost perfect is due to the 1.8\" LCD. I wish it had the 2.5\" LCD like the Rebel XTi. But I'll say this.. the 1.8\" LCD is way more bright when compared to the early Canon 1.8\" screens. So pound for pound, this camera is a jewel to sparkle. If you land a great deal like I did. You won't regret it.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "The old god of enthusiast photography", "Author": "I. Ginev", "ReviewID": "R1E4VELGC7NUMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After almost 5 years with this camera, I'm finally inclined to upgrade... But nothing below 40D is a real option. Here's why I like it so much:1. It has upgradeable firmware. Doing this will allow you to use the hidden features of the camera and basically turn your 300D into 10D.2. It has 2 separate screens - one LCD for viewing images and one LED for system information which is really useful . This feature is missing in 350, 400, etc. models.3. It's big and feels very solid in your hands, not like its successors. Equipped with a battery grip, you'll have a wonderful tool at your disposal.4. It has 6 megapixel matrix, which means silky smooth images up to 400 ISO and very nice noise at 800 ISO. 6 MP lets you capture lots of detail but it doesn't mean you'll have unnecessarily big files even when shooting in RAW.Some concerns:1. It's USB 1.1 but that's normal considering it was made in 2003.2. The flash is ugly.3. The DIGIC processor is slow. Previewing images and startup times are slow.4. It has a small screen by todays standards.All in all, if you can find it for a good price, take it :)", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 300D Digital Rebel", "Author": "M.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1DYUNUPMW1IHZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't buy this camera. If your budget is limited, buy a point-and-shoot. The modern ones have nearly the same high-ISO performance. Or save for a 20D or better.Reasons to buy this camera:* It's cheap. $100 used.* It has fine image quality from ISO 100 to ISO 400, capable of prints up to 16\"x24\"* It has a good grip* It's an EOS DSLR, so you can use Canon's lenses and accessoriesReasons not to buy this camera:* Vastly superior cameras (e.g., 20D) are available for not much more* Automatic AF point selection is slow and doesn't work in low light* Automatic flash exposure is terrible* The screen is small, low-resolution, and not color accurate* The interface is antiquated and difficult to navigate* It's missing a lot of useful features like mirror lockup* It's a godawful slow body for continuous shooting or for raw* It has a lot of shutter lag* It's not capable of motion tracking with any consistency* It's slow in general for picture review, card formatting, and so on* It's not water resistant in any way; repair costs for water damage are over $200* The kit lens is garbage below f/8The only reason I'd buy this body would be to digitize slides, or for some other project that didn't require actually using it as a camera.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Cheap dSLR for Beginners!", "Author": "S. Li", "ReviewID": "RYI94IEHGKGCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Probably the best beginner's camera out there that produces quality photos at almost laughable costs! I bought mine used for $60 (body only) with a kit lens ($40) and the f/1.8 50mm ($80). Combine all of that, I have a $180 dSLR to learn from until I have the money to purchase a better body. The previous reviews have hit the jackpot on why you shouldn't get this camera, but I'm here to tell you why you definitely SHOULD.1. Ability to upgrade to the hacked firmware[...] (guide to updating your 300D: [...]- Enables Custom functions menu- Enables Flash Exposure Compensation using SET button- Enables SET button function when shooting (to change image quality or shooting parameters)- Enables Shutter release w/o CF card- Flash sync speed in Av mode- Enables RAW+JPEG rec. Enables setting the quality of embedded JPEG- Enables Mirror Lock up- Enables the ability to select the autofocus mode: AI servo, Oneshot etc.- Enables setting ISO 3200With the updated firmware, the camera is completely customizable, and you'll be able to learn all about how to create the best shots2. Using manual external flashes. I bought a used speedlight for $30 and have been creating unbelievable images using bounce flashes. Who needs e-TTL2 or whatever anyway? Go with manual and learn the right way!3. It's more about the lens, less about the camera body. With a tremendous lens, any SLR will produce amazing photographs. Sure the ISO quality is terrible with 800 ISO or higher, but programs such as Adobe Lightroom and filter programs will get rid of some of the noise. The sensor is not as larger as the newer models, but with the external flash, a tripod, anything you can do with your $700 dSLR, I can do with my 300D.4. Best of all, this camera is faster and, simply, better, than any of digital point and shoots. I have a modern, 18MP megazoom camera that I use for mobile reasons, but it has nowhere the quality as the 300D.5. Buy a $5 external CF card reader and you won't have to deal with the USB1.1 speeds.6. Who cares about the small screen and the slow preview times? You can take thousands of photos on RAW at a time with a 4GB card - just review and delete later on your computer.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Zachary Norris", "ReviewID": "R16D24UIJPPVD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I just want to say I ordered my camera and received in a week!!
