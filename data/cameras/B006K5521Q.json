{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very competent do-all camera", "Author": "Analog", "ReviewID": "R3MI9HSRN88XQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HX10V is a solidly built and solidly performing camera. Is it perfect? No. As one reviewer remarks, the color accuracy is not entirely accurate. To my eye, over saturated and having difficulty with gradations of blue and red.  Reminds me a bit of Fuji Velvia. Color can be adjusted, though it is a minor hassle. I find the camera also has a bit of trouble with a yellow/green shift in indoor lighting-less than ideal white balance in tungsten and fluorescent light. Using flash or fill flash eliminates the issue. Flash exposure is decent in low light. Fill flash is very good in bright light. The camera's flash has quite a bit of punch for a P&S.; The camera has a bit more noise reduction than I prefer. In fact, the noise reduction reduces the effective sharpness of the lens. The lens on the 10V is quite impressive, especially when considering it is 16x. It is resistant to straight on flare, but tangential flare is an issue.  If only the lens had a provision for a lens hood... The distortion in the lens is well controlled. It isn't up to full on architectural work, but who would use a P&S; for architecture? All in all, an impressive and ambitious optic. The i modes of the 10V are the real deal. They slow down some of the responsiveness of the camera, but they deliver superior results in specialized situations. Personally, I love the background blur mode. Excellent pseudo-bokeh. The AF system is very speedy and tracks very well for a P&S.; Facial recognition is excellent. The camera's video modes are quite competent. I am not a video expert, but the image stabilization, sound, and resolution are excellent considering it is a P&S.; When looked at as a complete package, the 10V is well worth the price of admission.Addition 8/2012: After using the camera for a few months, I have found more quibbles: difficult getting a good sunset exposure, wishing there was more manual over rides, AVCHD eats up hard drive space on a Mac. On the plus side, I really have to praise the optics on the camera again. Great optic for the zoom range. The camera is quite fun to use and competent with a very high percentage of shooting conditions.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Read Manual! Great Motions Shots!", "Author": "10ant", "ReviewID": "R28M9SVR6863X4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Watched the C-net reviews and read the Amazon reviews and there was quite a few mentions of simplicity.  Simple for so many features?  Yes.  But for the average guy like me who never takes the time to read a manual and does things through trial and error.  I'd recommend spending a little time understanding the different functions.  It will make for a better experience with less errors.  Camera is great, took some difficult shot while moving.  I was amazed that the camera got the pics.  Took pictures from a moving seaplane and bobbing boat with hardly any blurred shots.  The camera works great. Panoramic function is awesome.  Haven't seen any of the issues with colors not being true as some people mention.I gave four stars mostly for the design.  The flash on the top pops up when you are holding the camera. Of course my finger is always over it.  The big screen on the back is nice, but if you drop the camera on the corner just right there is nothing that is going to protect it from cracking.  And lastly, although all Cyber-shots have the same dial, my finger struggles to hit the middle button just right.Other than that.  Great camera!UPDATE-12-5-12 Camera display stopped working.  The very concern I mentioned above regarding the screen cracking and being to close to corner has proven to be a worthy concern. Camera was in protective Caselogic case and never dropped. Screen just went blank.  Had to send it back to Sony for repair.  Waiting for repairs.  I'll keep you posted on costs.Conclusion 1-15-12  Camera back and fixed.  Sony didn't charge me for repair.  Took two weeks.  I had to pay for shipping to Sony.  Camera works great.  Only problem with repairs is a hair on the screen in the casing.  Drives me nuts but doesn't seem to effect camera.  Plus I don't want to be without it for another 2 weeks.  Just live with it.  Sony was very responsive.

Hopefully, just a fluke with the camera I had. Update: Received my replacement today, I decided to order a different color instead of the white like I had before. Apparently, it depends on which color you choose where the camera is made. The white camera I returned was made in China, the black and red cameras are made in Japan, not sure where the silver cameras are made.*****************************This is my second Sony camera, the first Sony I tried 2 years ago got LOUSY pet shots on the Pet scene setting, but was a good camera otherwise. I returned it since shooting pictures of my cats is the reason I purchased it Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-WX9 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Black).Let me tell you - this HX10V runs rings around the WX9 (all these model numbers get confusing after awhile!). The camera feels solidly built. Several camera blog/review sites say it's metal, but it feels like plastic to me, although sometimes aluminum feels plastic-like so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. The tripod mount is metal, and the battery/SD card door feels a little flimsy like most do, just be careful with it and you should be OK.This is a KEEPER! On the Pet setting, it takes excellent photos and the default setting keeps the flash and also the focus assist button turned off - these usually will bother your pet's eyes if left on so this is an excellent decision on Sony's part...for instance: I'm a Panasonic camera lover usually and Panasonic's Pet setting leaves the default flash on auto and the red-lamp (focus assist) is also turned on and it's hard to get a photo where my cats' eyes aren't shut. Sony put some thought into the set-up here.And me being a Panasonic lover (in the not too distant past) I was never satisifed with the softness of a Panasonic camera photo.  I always had to tweek them in Picasa to sharpen them up a bit, as well as make the colors a little brighter.  Not with this Sony.  I have done no post-processing other than cropping.PROS:> Photos almost always turn out PERFECT!  Just the right amount of color and sharpness!> BEST VIDEO of any point & shoot camera, even expensive $600.00+ cameras I have tried! In fact, if you set the HD to the highest setting on this camera, it gives you a warning that if you are burning to a DVD, you need to make it Blu-Ray it's so good.> Solid build, although mine was made in China.  I think some are made in Japan, some China.> LCD screen is amazing, 921,000 dots, the reviews of the pictures looking at it on the camera almost look better than on your PC monitor.> Sony G Lens...an excellent lens used on their more expensive cameras.> Easy user-interface on the menus. I have only had to look at the manual once (looking for the macro setting).> Background Defocus...No need for a full manual camera to achieve the blurred backgrounds; this does a great job but you have to be around 30cm (approx. 12 inches) from subject for it to turn out well.> Battery life is excellent.> For those of you who don't want to fuss with a bunch of different settings, you can set this camera to EASY SHOOTING mode, it gives you all the \"basics\" to get great photos, but the wording on the LCD screen is in larger print, making it easier to read, and since you don't have many shooting options, very easy to take a photo and still have it turn out exceptional. The EASY SHOOTING mode is PERFECT for anyone new to digital cameras (there may still be a few!)CONS:> I don't like having to charge the battery inside the camera, but that is remedied by buying a separate battery charger.> LCD screen glare is a little iffy outdoors, I may pick up a matte screen protector to help.> 18 MegaPixels!  Really, this is a con - with a sensor this size, you don't need over 12 MP in a camera, more is not better in this case; but I will have to say, it doesn't seem to affect quality much on this camera.THE ZOOM: This camera has 16X optical, it will show on the screen when it starts becoming digital (digital is known for being horrible quality)...with either optical or digital, to look good you will need a tripod. The digital goes to 32X but photo quality will be poor with digital. (You can disable the digital zoom in the Tools Menu).GPS: Once you take your camera outdoors or near a door/window, that will trigger the GPS to initialize. Personally I don't care if I have GPS, whenever I upload a photo online, I don't want people to gather even MORE information about me, like my latitude/longitude coordinates. So I disabled this feature in the Tools Menu.RE: SUPERIOR AUTO VS. INTELLIGENT AUTO (on the Mode Dial). You have more settings to choose from on Superior, but I have noticed the camera processes more slowly between shots. On Intelligent Auto I get better results and the camera processes between shots seconds faster, almost instantly.SOFTWARE: There is no CD in the box; the software is stored inside the camera. Once you plug the camera into your PC for the first time, it will download and also get the latest updates off the web. PlayMemories is the name of the software and I like it almost as much as Photoshop Elements.For good quality video and fast camera processing I recommend a Class 10 SDHC card:Sony SF16NX/TQM 16GB SDHC Class 10 Memory CardIf you're looking for a well-made case and don't want to pay the high price for a Sony OEM case:Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case with Storage (Black)Keep checking back, I'm in the process of uploading photos, but it takes awhile for Amazon to approve them.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ermm..", "Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "R2WMVFQUMMDSKC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a day and a half now.Day one:-I find out that it does not have manual focus like the hx9v-I play around with the effects which aren't as impressive as my old canon.-I try out the zoom which is fantastic.

I'm not a pro photographer I just want a good point and shoot and this is it. My last three cameras, a Panasonic, a Cannon, and an Olympus, were all terrible at indoor photos, but this Sony is fantastic. I have been researching cameras for the past 6 months this time around. I considered Cannon, Olympus, Sony, and Panasonic. I wanted good low light capability, hi speed shots, and at least a 10x zoom. The DSC-HX10V has everything I need. The time to on is quick, and the high speed shots are excellent. I eliminated the Cannons, due to several sources stating slow focusing. A Panasonic in this same price range would be my 2nd choice but some pro websites say the photo quality is not as good as Sony. I did not see anything by Olympus that suited me. I can't speak to battery life since I've only owned the camera a week, but I purchased extra batteries and an external charger so I'm not very concerned. I took pictures at a friends baptism inside a church, (poor lighting conditions) but this camera took them in stride. For poor lighting conditions this camera will quickly take 2 photos at different exposures and combine them together, this takes a moment to process, but the results are excellent.

The main problem I have with it is the specialty battery pack. I used to have a camera using AAs, so there was never an issue getting more juice for it, no matter where I was. Now initially I wasn't all that worried about the battery being a specialized one because it was supposed to charge with a micro USB connection, and these days you can find almost always someone somewhere with a micro USB cable. What Sony does not tell you is, the battery only charges with the original Sony micro USB. No idea how they manage to do that, but my camera would not charge with any of my other 8 micro USB cables I have except for the original Sony one. A real bummer to me. You can download the pictures with any other cable, but not charge it. Whoever  thought this one up failed in my opinion. The pictures it takes are nice, but again, as some already mentioned, the flash is in a bad spot, my fingers are always covering it up and it is also overexposing the pics if you are fairly close to your target.

Keller", "ReviewID": "R32UP0M2R7NPJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (DSC-HX10V) and the Sony DSC-WX150.  I ran various home grown tests on both cameras under various conditions: action, with flash, without flash, zoom, natural light, etc.  Both cameras were set to the \"automatic smart green setting\".  The DSC-HX10V (this camera) photos were much more true to color in all photo testing.  Consistently the WX150 had a blueish hint to the photos - as in a vivid purple iris looked blue not purple like real life.  We have oak bookcases.  Comparing photos side by side with both cameras, the bookcases with the WX150 didn't have the golden undertones.  We called Sony about the blue issue and they said it must be a defective unit.  That may be the case.  I can only report on my experience.On the zoom test, I put both cameras to 10X optical and turned digital zoom off (note the HX10V has optical zoom to 16X).  I took pictures of the spines of my kids books from across the room.  The edges of the letters with the WX150 were \"noisy\" whereas the HX10V (this camera) at 10x optical were very clear (no, I did not pixel peep).  If you don't plan to do a lot of detailed zooming because you can be closer to your subject, this should be no big deal.  I take pictures of my kids swimming from the stands - I need a decent zoom without lugging a DSLR or hybrid.Both cameras performed about the same on action shots.  I had my kids jump on the bed for several minutes while my husband and I took photos with both cameras at the same time.  The HX10V does have a true sports mode which helped to reduce the blur some.  I still had to take a bunch to get the lucky action shots on both cameras.Note: all pictures were taken from the same distance, compared side by side, at the same size on the same monitor.  In other words this was as scientific as an average camera owner (not photographer) would do.  Ultimately we opted for the HX10V for the extra $60-$70.The only thing I liked better about the WX150 is the flash is built in whereas the HX10V's flash is a pop up and it is right where I want to hold the camera with the left hand (very annoying).  Though the HX10V flash is brighter and goes a farther distance.To compensate for the pop up flash, we get a nice \"rubberized\" and 3D hand/finger grip with a thumb grip on the back.  This definitely helps balance the camera better.  Though I recommend using the wrist strap to be safe - just as we do with the Wii remotes.The HX10V also has the 16X Optical zoom I mentioned, some fun features like toy, pop, etc, ability to adjust hue easily, a few extra smart modes and a little more control over settings like a M and P mode (not that I would use them but they are there).  Both have a full HD movie mode and can take 3D photos (though I couldn't test this as I don't have a 3D monitor).  I am sure there are other wonderful features but these are the ones I noticed.I hope this helps the average camera buyer.

I own the silver color HX10V. with this model Sony switches to a universal charge port a micro-usb. This is great camera it is well balanced spec wise. The #1 thing you should stay away from is a small sensor with lots of mega pixels, which just causes NOISE. To put it simply I put this 2011 camera against Sony\u2019s own 2012 HX20V/HX30V & 2013 HX50V. and even took it against Panasonics 2013 Flagship Lumix ZS30. In most cases the hx10v performed better than all the cameras listed above. The white balance on this camera is great and low light video and photos are great too.

I most cases when you decide to go for the latest and greatest you may not be getting the most for your dollar since you could be paying for features you wouldn\u2019t even use. Nowadays camera makers even SONY are cramming more mega pixels in to small sensor point and shoot cameras. Everyone always has something to say about the RX100 and I have done my research and believe me it\u2019s a HEAVENLY sent camera but the number one reason I didn\u2019t and wont buy it is its LIMITED 3.6X zoom. I am a father of  5 girls ages 2, 5, 11, 13, 14 and all you want is a camera you can drop in your shirt pocket and go.

You must remember to turn the log on at the beginning of your trip and turn it off when you are done. If you don't turn it off, the log doesn't get recorded to your SD card.I compared the Sony's track log with a track log from a \"real\" GPS. In short, the Sony was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. The accuracy was horribly off. You can tell because when you walk up a trail and back down with a real GPS, both tracks are within a few feet of each other. But the Sony GPS return track was off by several hundred feet. Also, your position is logged only once every 15 seconds or so, not every second like a real GPS. Not that it would matter with this abysmal accuracy. Bear in mind that both GPS units were taken on the same hike at the same time so they should have been identically affected by any environment issues such as poor signal reception.The in-camera pano produces nice shots if you use a tripod. You must turn the camera slowly and steadily to the right. It takes a 180 degree pano -- you have no other choice. Also, you cannot use zoom during a pano. Nevertheless the result can look pretty good once you get the hang of shooting panos, which only takes a few tries.Battery life exceeded Sony's claims. I got almost 500 snapshots including a lot of zooming in and out, plus over 10 minutes of video, before the battery finally ran down. I didn't use much flash though.As others mention, the charging plug is weird. First, it won't take a standard USB mini cable. You have to use the included Sony cable, so don't lose it! Next, the cable plugs in to the BOTTOM of the camera which is awkward, and of course can't be used when you're on a tripod. Also, the camera will PLAY BACK pictures and video while connected to external power, but won't take photos. Why, Sony, why??I'd like to have hopes for this camera in the future. The locking up problem is most likely a firmware version 1.0 issue. If Sony doesn't release an update, though, this camera may be no better than a brick.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needed more zoom for soccer action pictures", "Author": "Richard A.

Just past 700 photos and videos on the new HX10 and its picture quality is much sharper than on the HX5, however, the video quality isn't as good.Sony moved the HDR photo mode from the selection knob to the scene mode - since the scene mode defaults to your last selection, it hasn't been a nuisance.  I use this setting a lot on early morning, shadowy, mountain hikes.  Results are a little hit or miss, but if you want more than just a silhouette, it does bring out some detail.The HX10 has a new super special auto mode where the camera automatically selects the perfect scene mode for your shot.  At first I thought it was just another useless gadget, but I found it is surprisingly effective.  One caveat is that the camera takes extra time to process the image after the shutter is released, so don't use this setting if you are trying to quickly capture multiple shots.I do use the panoramic mode often and it is excellent.  The HX10 now has a high res option which results is a very large file size.  I prefer to shoot panoramics holding the camera in portrait orientation sweeping from left to right.  The HX10 does a great job holding the exposure through the continuous shot.I will say that the HX5 has been the most durable camera that I've owned in a long time and the HX10 appears to have great build quality as well.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony HX10V - not thrilled", "Author": "JP", "ReviewID": "R4K5CAVGJZCIU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the HX10V but am having issues with the use of the flash.

The quality of the imagesare outstanding, and it goes from wide angle to 16X optical zoom.  It can be usedfull automatically, either using Superior Auto or Intelligent Auto.  You can also selectfrom a multitude of scene modes.  Also note that it has a panoramic as well as a3D mode.  Check out any online review, but note that this camera is the same as aLeica that costs about 3X as much.  Incidentally, the ISO goes up to12,800, buttypically defaults to about 800 ISO in low light with the flash off.  Of course this willvary greatly depending upon lighting conditions.  The internal rechargeable battery is notcharged by removing the battery and placing it into a charger, but by inserting acable into the bottom of the camera.  Some people may find that inconvenient, butI have gotten used to that system.

I already own a Sony DSLR and half-a-dozen lenses, a Panasonic ZS8, and a Canon SX40HS, so I am not hurting for a camera to shoot with, and they all have their individual purposes. The HX10V has the Sony \"G\" lens, which is very sharp at all focal lengths, and is fairly quick to focus, even on moving subjects, although panning certainly helps. The zoom range (16X) is a very respectable 25-410 mm (in 35mm terms). Your video is 1080p, and 60FPS is selectable. The videos are very smooth at 60FPS, and the G lens is extremely sharp. The pictures are great, the video is outstanding. The panorama feature is nice, in that you can choose to sweep from left to right, or right to left, or down to up, or up to down. You can do 3D  pictures, and so much more to keep you busy. I am still discovering things I didn't know, but I like the camera very much. A great camera to take motorcycling, where room is limited.

Basically I bought this camera as a little camera to take not so spectacular pictures with. So far, it has proved me wrong.  The Good:  The camera is small and easy to carry. I cannot fit it in my coat pocket, but have been wearing it around my neck without pain or bother. It starts up very quickly (a very important feature for me). You hit the power and it is ready to take pictures.  It seems to have a good frame per second rate (FPS). It is not as good as my DSLR, but I would not expect that. You can \"set\" the FPS rate, but I have seen no difference between the slow and fast.  The special effects mode is really fun. One of my other cameras has this mode, but this Sony seems to be better. The options are: Painting, Rich Black and White, Mini,  Toy, Pop, Part (only one color shows up), Soft High key, Watercolor, and Illustration. You can take a normal picture and then apply different special effects. The best part is that it keeps your original picture so you don't ruin it.  The camera seems to have very accurate color. I have been impressed with the hues. I have not been out with it on a really sunny day, but on snowy days it is spot on.  The zoom is good. With a lot of cameras it feels like you can never get close enough. With this one you can.  If you have kids who don't like to have their picture taken, you can set the camera to smile mode and ask your kids which is faster, them or the camera. All you do is hold the camera aimed at the kid, and it takes a shot every time that they smile (great game and great pictures too).  The video seems to be great quality.The not so good:  This camera does not take micro shots. It does not have a Micro setting on Scene setting, and I cannot get it to focus close up.  If you accidently have it on Pet and try to take a picture of a kid, it always seems to be blurry, even though you cannot tell that from looking at the view finder.  The view finder really is hard to see in some outdoor light. You point shoot, and hope that when you get home you actually got something.  The buttons are too small to use with gloves. I cannot even get the thing turned on while wearing gloves, and I can fat finger it and push a lot of wrong buttons with them on.  Like everyone else has said, the flash is in a terrible place.  The manual is basically non existent. You must either go online for instructions or push the help button on the camera. The manual basically tell you how to turn it on, that is it.  All in all, I really like this camera more than I thought that I would. The Pixel size means that you can crop your shots and/or blow them up without problems. I bought mine at the local warehouse for two with an 8gb memory card and a small case included.

Even in a well-lit interior room, it slows the shutter speed so much that any amount of hand shake blurs the image (even with image stabilization on).  Another annoying issue that I hear is common of the brand is that the images displayed on the LCD screen have a yellow/green hue.  The actual pictures are fine, but it's just about impossible to tell how good of a shot you get color-wise from the LCD until you transfer it to a computer to see the image's actual color.

I say loved because I (so sadly) do not have it anymore because it was stolen. But the shots I took were great. Never got to see them on my computer because I only brought my tablet on vacation, not my laptop. If I had brought my laptop, I might still have my pics because I would have uploaded them to it. Anyway, I bought my camera at Costco before my trip to Costa Rica. Figured I'd upgrade my camera because the one I had was about 6 years old and pics are so much sharper, video better, etc. This camera even has a feature that you can take a video and take pics too. It is really a wonderful camera for a very reasonable price. I went on a tour of Lake Arenal and there was a family of White Faced Monkeys in a tree that you could barely see from the boat. I zoomed in and took picture, and they came out excellent. I also took pics and video of an iguana that was right outside a restaurant that we went to for lunch. So cool.....I had so many pics. But like I said, it was stolen from me. This was a couple of days before we left Costa Rica. I had my Nexus Tablet with me and on the way from Quepos to San Jose, we saw a group of Spider Monkeys that were in a tree. There was about 20 or so monkeys. They were swinging on the tree and then they crossed this rope that was stretched across from that tree to another on the other side of the road. Here are all these people in the shuttle we took taking pics and videos and I couldn't take any cause my camera was gone. So I opened up my tablet and kept trying to find the camera to take a picture. At least I'd have something, right????? No because even though the tablet advertises that it has a camera, there's no app on it. I found out later that you have to download the app from the app store. How stupid it that???? Anyway, needless to say, this camera takes great pics, of which I have none. I went back to Costco to see if I could get another one, but they don't carry it anymore. It looks like Sony came out with an upgraded one, so I'll have to look into that.
