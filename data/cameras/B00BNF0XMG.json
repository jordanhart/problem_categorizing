So far we have purchased six of these to use in a law enforcement environment to photograph crime scenes.  The camera is durable and the backpack helps to prevent our officers from damaging or breaking it.  It captures high quality clear crisp images with the standard lens as well as the zoon lens.  Manual adjustments make it possible to take perfect shots in almose any lighting condition. The 32gig card and battery allows for storage of hundreds of images without having to recharge or use an additional card.This was an excellent purchase.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$734.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Battery Grip for D3100 & D3200 +\n<4> PD Laptop/Tablet DSLR Backpack + <5> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <6> Spare EN-EL14 Battery + <7> Battery Charger +\n<8> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <9> Additional Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <10> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <11> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> HB-45 Lens Hood + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 55-200mm VR Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Grip + HDMI Cable + Filters Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61Cei86WCtL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BNF0XMG"}}
