{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's the better Leica", "Author": "ChrisC", "ReviewID": "R2ROIOPWBZLEHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you've shot Leica before then the short summary of this review is: The Leica M typ 240 is the better camera.The Leica M9 had lots of character, that special quality that's hard to describe but oh so easy to see in your photos - but the M9 also had a lot of limitations and sometimes frustrating shortcomings, the look was second to none, but trying to shoot a few frames in quick succession and the camera could freeze and require you to take out and re-insert the battery. The LCD screen was good for reading menu text, but really viewing photos on it was more of a theoretical thing since the color cast and detail was horrible and zooming in to see if you nailed the focus would take seconds to render - I could go on and on, but as far as the system around the amazing imaging went, it was a barely working camera.The typ 240 changes all of that and more - the rangefinder focusing is more accurate and it'll nail more shots then ever before, the sensor is higher quality, the colors are more accurate, no more green cast and blown out reds. The LCD screen is beautiful and zooming in to photos is instant, files are now usable upto 3200 ISO - and it even has live view which can be quite useful when it's too dark to RF focus or when you're shooting at f0.95. Just everything about it is a huge step forward and makes for a much better camera.If you haven't shot Leica before, then this short review won't be enough to tell you everything you need to know - but there's countless resources available online to help you out there. But I will say this, the quality of the photos from the M typ 240 are far better than any Canon or Nikon DSLR can produce, the contrast, saturation, colors and sharpness the M combined with Leica lenses can deliver is out of this world - and when you do nail that shot, the Leica will make it look better.The rangefinder system is much harder to use, manual focus, a very poor exposure system, very  few bells and whistles compared to most modern camera's - but that's not what the Leica system is about - the Leica is all about slowing down, taking photos full of intent and art. So it'll help you take beautiful photos if you're willing to take on the challenge, but if you're looking for features and something that can shoot 11fps, auto-focus, do subject tracking in sports of birding, or even has real lenses beyond 135mm or zoom lenses for that matter - get a D800 or a 5D Mark III instead - they'll give you 90% of the image quality for 30% of the price and give you a much wider choice of lenses. If however you want that special range finger experience with that look that nothing else can product, than this system is for you - and the 240 is the best Leica made to date, by far.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product - the basics still yield amazing pictures", "Author": "Tampa Pat", "ReviewID": "R3H1TOOGB0ZAO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a semi-pro photographer for 4 years. I'm the type of photographer that will travel the ends of the earth for the right picture.  I have been shooting with Nikon for about 15 years and went through the transition of film to digital.  Today I have a Nikon D800E and a D4... And then some time ago, I decided to explore the world of black and white. So I dove in and purchased a Leica M Monochrom.  My world has never been the same since.Composition and perception are just not the same. You can't look for color when you shoot monochrome but I find myself looking at textures and subject substantially more. I've always preferred prime lenses (except for weddings and sporting events) and Leica can do primes better than anyone else.  The optics are just the most amazing you will ever see.This camera represents the best of both worlds. By leveraging the best optics end incredible 24MP resolution the results are phenomenal.You will not be disappointed in this purchase should you be able to put your hands on one of them.They are simply amazing.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A little buyer's remorse", "Author": "Sam \"Sammy\"", "ReviewID": "RN6EKWIBG7QPW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I often try to talk myself into liking something that I got ripped off on buying in order to justify getting ripped off.  I feel a little bit that way with this camera.  Before you say, \"Oh you are a poor person; you aren't the right consumer for a Leica; go buy a Panasonic,\" let me interject that the M240 is my third Leica and I'm absolutely not afraid to spend money.  I'm not going to return this camera or unload it onto craigslist or the like but I don't feel good about how much it cost; it feels like a bad value.  I would have been happy to pay $2-3k for this but for $7k+ I could have bought a Sony full frame and a bunch of new glass for it.  The only reason I'm keeping this is because the images are breathtaking and I can use the $30k worth of Leica glass I already own and know how to use/like and not have to buy more lenses.The good:* Great colors* Full frame resolution - picture quality is breathtaking* Rapid Frames Per Second Capability - (More frames per second than my Monochrom)* Live View on the screen - I can do Macro photos with a stack of spacers; can't do that on any other Leicas except with a single spacer and goggles* Focus Peaking - (very helpful with a Noctilux or other hard-to-focus lens or doing macro)* Screen - screen tells me what my shutter speed setting is (helpful in the dark when I'm changing from 1/60 to 1s to B or whatever)* Tripod mount is more solid than the Monochrom - instead of connecting to the baseplate the mount connects to the camera body itself.  This is really helpful and noticeable.* Accessories - I can use the Leica extended grip with finger loop on the M240.  The extended grip on the MM does *not* have a fingerloop option and is noticeably flexible and less solid that the M24.  I usually switch base plates on the MM back to the \"stock\" base plate instead of the \"large grip\" base plate because the large grip base plate is so flexible.  The large grip baseplate on the M240 is solid as a rock.The bad:* Bulb setting maxes out at 60 seconds (or worse, at only 30 seconds at ISO >200).  For some reason this really bothers me.  I take lots of pictures with long exposures and now I will have to \"stack\" them if I want 3-4 minutes and I don't know how to do \"stacking\" in photoshop and I don't want to learn; I just want to take pictures. The monochrom maxes out at 240 seconds and that sort of bothers me but I have yet to need longer than 240 seconds for any shots and so I still love the monochrom.* Dirty sensor from the factory - I don't know if I just got unlucky on QC but the sensor had dust spots all over it and I had to clean the sensor 5 times in the first week I owned it because dust somehow kept getting on the sensor even though I didn't remove the lens from the camera between cleanings.  It is almost like something was dirty inside the camera body and migrating out into the sensor area and causing problems.  I've never had such a problem with any other camera, whether from Leica, Fuji, Canon, Sony, Panasonic or anyone else* System lockup - In the week I've owned it the camera has locked up on me where it wouldn't respond to inputs from any button and I had to remove the battery to reset it.  I've heard complaints about this on other Leicas; it has never happened to me on my Monochrom.* Shutter button feel - unlike the shutter on my Monochrom, which feels like a camera shutter, the shutter on the M240 feels like the button on my iphone.  I hate it.* Menu System - the menu system is complicated and gives me a headache.  The reason I use a Leica instead of a Sony, Nikon or Cannon is that I don't need to read a 300 page manual to know how to use it; shutter speed, aperture and focus is all I need to know.  Other than White Balance, nothing in the menu structure is helpful for me and it is just screen after screen of headache.  If I wanted to tolerate menu systems and little buttons I could have saved $5k and bought the Sony.All in, it takes great pictures and when I combine that with my level of laziness I will end up keeping it.  But I wish I'd bought the Sony instead.  Or just stayed with my crappy, cheap Fuji cameras for color because they work fine for 1/10th of the price.  The M240 isn't 10x better than my Fujis, it is just 10x as expensive.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great opens new possibilities", "Author": "Norman Rogers \"Global warming skeptic\"", "ReviewID": "R1X574Y8GC1SJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I managed to score an M a few months ago. It was not easy. I purchased the Olympus VF-2 electronic viewfinder - its the same as the Leica w/o the Leica name and costs half as much. Works perfectly. I also got the novoflex Nikon F to Leica M lens adapter. This allows the use of Nikon lenses including those w/o built in aperture adjustment. This is all possible due to through the lens focusing (live view) enabled by electronic viewfinder/ back screen and x10 magnification button. I also got a T adapter so I can use the camera through a telescope.The software could use some changes. For example there is no way to set the lens focal length longer than 135mm and auto exposure gives a shutter time option of 1/focal length only. There should be more options somewhere, like 1/2*focal length, etc.This camera is not a substitute for a Nikon for fast moving action. Live view focusing is slow compared to rangefinder much less autofocus on a Nikon SLR. If you use the classic exposure mode (using light reflected from the shutter curtain) rather than advanced (the factory default, using the sensor)  there is less messing with the shutter by the camera and it is quieter.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "4 1/2 stars really, if that's an option", "Author": "S. Yang \"Gadget Tester\"", "ReviewID": "R2P8XCDGBUHGXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the other 3-star review and thought he raised some good points.  My sensor glass is also dirty with scattered dust even though it came straight from the factory, through an authorized dealer.  My camera also froze a couple times during the first month of use that required me to remove the battery to reset.However, the camera should only be judged by the quality of the images it produces, not the inconveniences it may create.  On this front, the Leica M is a winner!  It is just not fair to compare the Leica M to any Sony or Fuji camera (or Canon or Nikon for that matter, which I have owned over the years because Leica was slow on moving into the digital realm).  Those machines don't even come close!  The other brands produce fine photos, but Leica is in a league of its own. Coupled with a high-end Leica lens, you will see the difference, you can't miss it!I wish I could have given this camera 4-1/2 stars for it is definitely NOT perfect!  But it is a major improvement over the M9, which I hated.  The quality of the photos coming out of Leica M is simply impeccable.
