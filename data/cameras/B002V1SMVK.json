{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect Choice!", "Author": "Roy Meier", "ReviewID": "R3O3IGAWP6ASMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an aspiring photographer for most of my adult life and always striving to get that better shot.I'll never be a pro, but always striving for a better photo. I used to have a nice 35mm outfit with multiple lenses, but then the digital age came into play. I've had a few digital cameras, but nothing with the capabilities of a true SLR. Finally, with much thanks to my Wife, I have a new Canon Eos Rebel t1i and couldn't be happier and am very impressed with the image quality of this camera. If you want simple, just run in full auto mode. After that, the capabilities with the various modes are as flexible as your imagination. I'm just getting started (had it for 3 weeks now), but each time I use it, I'm more impressed. Definitely a great camera for the money. I purchased with the standard 18-55 mm Kit lens and also the 75-250mm zoom. I would recommend doing the same, or at least plan on adding lenses down the road. These two lenses give me a very good range and I'm finding the zoom is great for candid photos and wildlife shots. Time will tell, but so far, I think I made the right choice.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best camera on the planet!!!", "Author": "R. Owens \"Riverdancing barbeque chef\"", "ReviewID": "R3R1BJ596WGN1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I've been using point and shoots and becoming frustrated with the results. This is my first foray into DSLR land, and I have to say, I'm hooked! This has got to be the MOST versatile piece of equipment that I've ever owned. Of course there's a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have problems putting this camera down. Eventually, I hope to upgrade, but for right now, this is the camera to have. If you're thinking about buying one, stop thinking about it and do it. You WON'T be disappointed, and the time you're spending thinking about it could be better spent taking pictures.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "AG", "ReviewID": "R2ZFUMRC3LQOSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm impressed with the pictures clarity and details! The autofocus works amazingly fast. Manual focus is very easy. I'm still learning to use the camera (my oldest brother had an SLR camera 25 years ago, when I was a kid, so it has been a while I don't use one of these). Changing the lense is not confusing. The 18-55mm lens works great for shooting wide ange photos. The 55-275mm lens works very for zooming.I was able to shoot over 500 pictures before recharging the battery.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for the Novice", "Author": "Dawn R.

The pictures are super sharp, even in low light.  The only negative comment that I have is the movie mode.  It does not work as well as a camcorder.  Every other mode works really well and it is super easy to use.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Starter camera", "Author": "M.

The star rating i gave this Item is because the Item, Amazon and even the Seller whom i bought the item from have done what i feel is a good job as far as the purchase is concerned.however, The choice of shipper is the problem,The item will be delivered in the range of dates that amazon gave me but thats not the issue.  The issue is that the Fedex driver had my item at my front door with me in the house with another person and a dog who barks at any noise she hears and left a \"Door Tag\" that read \"Sorry We Missed You\".  In plain sight of the door he was standing at is my 56\" flat panel that was on at a normal volume and me sitting right in front of it.  If you can tell someone is home why not make sure you get their attention?  I dont mean kick the door in, But make enough of an effort to do your job you get paid to do!  The item will return tomorrow i'm sure maybe even with the same delivery driver, but here's the problem i wont be there to sign for it and niether will anyone else for the rest of the week. I took a day off work to be sure to be there and i get struck with a Fedex guy who cant KNOCK ON A DOOR.So in regaurds to the sellers choice of services they use to deliver you valued goods, Please be sure ask for a reliable service like UPS or at the very least USPS.I understand that this was an isolated case of laziness, however the shipping services used by sellers on Amazon.Com will shift due to issues like this. Shipping serivices that dont take pride in meeting or beating the dateline set by the Huge on-line market will fade away to a service who isn't to lazy to do their absolute best instead of being to affraid to Knock alil harder..", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002V1SMVK"}}
