{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Geoffrey Wilford", "ReviewID": "R1PAX840C0YBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to fill the gap between my iPhone 4S and my Canon D50 SLR.  This is a great camera for toting around and getting great shots.  I was particularly unhappy with the short range of the flash on an iPhone and how it darkened up images in its attempt to counteract.  This camera works perfectly and can rival some, certainly not all, but some of the shots of my D50 -- and it is certainly easier than carrying around all the lenses and bulky bag, etc. The WiFi works well as does the software, which I am very familiar with. Overall it s a great camera with good features.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "12.1 MP DIGIC 5 CMOS Sensor\n10x Optical Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle lens\nSmart AUTO, Intelligent IS, and 1080p Full HD video recording\nHigh Speed AF and High-Speed Burst up to 6.2 frames\nNew ECO Mode to reduce power consumption", "Name": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS 12.1 MP Wi-Fi Enabled CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full HD Video (Black) + 16GB Memory Card + Universal Memory Card Reader + Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51if0QjCXaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EPIWWEA"}}
