Takes great pictures in full auto mode, which is where I'll likely leave mine most of the time.  Internal memory is nearly nonexistant, but with an inexpensive 4 gb card installed you can take almost 1,000 14 m pics.  That's enough for me between downloads.  Also come with a nice software suite.Also has a visual and digital zoom.  Buy it.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "I wanted to like it. :-(", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R2IFSKR6YFNHNP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the fourth digital camera I have owned.  I wanted a smaller lighter camera with a little more zoom and better video capability.  I use it mostly for the grandchildren, around the house and yard, and on vacation.  I tested this camera over a wide range of conditions, inside and out.  MANY of the images were blurry.  And yes, there is an audible click in the video when you operate the zoom.  I would have put up with that if the images had been consistently clear. I own two SONY cameras and a Nikon CoolPix 8700.  The SONY's had their little bugs,BUT they were consistent and I knew what to expect. We are camera crazy and also have a Canon digital SLR, and my husband has a Canon Powershot SD880 that he is very happy with.  So I think it's fair to say I know when problem images are related to 'operator error\", which was not the case here. It's small and light, and the features are acceptable for my needs, but I could not get past the image problems.  My search continues.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could be much better....", "Author": "steelblue", "ReviewID": "R2SRNB03D8H25E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera takes nice pictures but the auto-focus can be very noisy.Overall, I would not recommend this camera.

A few minor things are better on the Cannon: dislike that a corded charger is needed (I'm tired of cords), latch for battery/sd card is difficult for fat fingers, wish for an auto-rotate of vertical pictures (unless it's there and I haven't figured it out yet). Need different and better computer based editing software. On camera editing is excellent.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera!", "Author": "E. Cox", "ReviewID": "R2CEVB58IQMZLK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have loved this camera. It's very compact so you can take it anywhere with you. It has a great zoom, and good picture quality. I love the spinning wheel on the back. Great feature. Overall, a very good camera. The only complaint I have for it is I wish it had a higher zoom in movie mode. It does zoom in and out while talking a video, but not much. I would recommend this camera to others.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14.2 megapixels for stunning prints as large as 20 x 30 inches\n7x wide-angle Optical Zoom-NIKKOR ED glass lens; 2.7-inch Clear Color Display\n720p HD movie recording at 30fps; HDMI output\n4-way VR Image Stabilization System; Smart Portrait System\nAdvanced Flash Control; EXPEED Image Processing\nKit includes leather carrying case and 2 GB SD memory card", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix S6000 14.2 MP Digital Camera with 7x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver) with Leather Case and 2GB SD Card", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RU1--EeXL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003JFH0JM"}}
