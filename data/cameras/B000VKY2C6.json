Photos are very good overall, with the exceptions noted below, and much better than my previous camera, a Nikon 4300.  The camera is small, nice looking, and has a huge LCD.  I also appreciated the integrated (and internal) lens cover and non-protruding optical zoom.  The image stabilization was another selling point for me.Then I got the camera home...  The slick look is slick (as in slippery) to hold, too.  The tiny buttons are not well differentiated, and like other reviewers I found myself accidentally hitting the power switch frequently.  The big LCD always looks grainy, making me think my photos weren't very good until I viewed them on my PC monitor.  I also found the interface confusing (and I'm no electronics newbie).But the real killer is the camera's speed.  Although it snaps open and lights up extremely quickly, it refuses to take a photo for about two seconds.  Press the shutter button again, and you're waiting 1 or 2 more seconds while it focuses and processes - by then the kids have turned away and are on to something else.  In short, it's just unbearably slow in everyday use.Back in the box, then.UPDATE: I returned this camera and purchased a Canon SD850 IS as a replacement.  I am much happier - the Canon is SUPER quick so I no longer get photos of the backs of the kids heads, their ears and hair, or the background when I was setting up the shot...  Other quirks with the Nikon that I noticed in a week of use: The battery/card door is VERY hard to open and feels flimsy; the charger requires a big bulky power cord; the slim design fit very nicely in a pocket.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very good, but I have a problem (Muy buena, pero tengo un problema).", "Author": "Federico Abreu", "ReviewID": "R1HFY5IR43GKVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is very comfortable and easy to use.  The 3 inches screen is fabulous.  The revolving wheel is a different way to show the multiple customized options and allows the reproduction of photos in multiple ways, one of them as a carrousel that turns when it rotates.The stabilizer of real images works efficiently! As if it was firmly supported.The problem I have is that the on/off button, located on top, reacts to very slight pressures unexpectedly turning on. It usually happens when sliding it into the protective case and into the trousers pocket. Although it turns automatically off in five minutes, the frequency of this occurrence contributes to unload the battery.I have found that 150 photos by battery load is very little.  It forces to buy an extra battery.  The battery icon appears too late when very little load on battery is left.  It should be present when the camera is turned on as it does for the amount of available photos and the actual setting.  This was one of the few things that made me angry about my old Nikon model which I still keep in working.-=+=-Muy c\u00f3moda y f\u00e1cil de usar.  La pantalla de 3\" es fabulosa.

I just would like to note some observations on my experience with the S51.a) Outside shots are perfectly exposed and very sharp at all zoom levels.  This is where this camera excels, you will be impressed.b) Inside shots are harsh with the built-in flash; but no worse than any other point and shoot camera.c) The autofocus system takes more time than I would like both inside and out.d) The camera is extremely compact and light, but feels sturdy.e) I've gotten about 150 shots per charge on the battery with a mix of flash and non-flash shots.f) The power button is mind boggingly frustrating; I absolutely wish Nikon made this button have to pressed for a couple of seconds before turning the camera on or off.  You have to pretty much assume the camera will be turned on and off, on and off if you carry it in your pocket.g) High-ISO performance is pretty poor, but no worse than other point and shoot cameras.h) The camera produces better images than the LCD screen displays in playback mode; the LCD for lack of a better word is 'coarse'.Overall I'm happy with the S51.

Nikon seems less popular than Canon in the P&S; market and it's easy to find this camera with a healthy discount.The camera features a huge LCD, a fast start-up time, very intuitive controls and menus, optical vibration reduction (VR), and high light sensitivity (ISO).  The last two features in particular set it apart from earlier Nikon models like the S1, which could not take a clean picture without the flash anywhere short of a professionally-lit studio.  Of course, the picture gets grainy fast if you use the higher ISO settings.The camera does have several faults mentioned by other reviewers: the response time is terrible, especially if you do not partially press the shutter button to pre-meter and focus.  The power button is too easy to hit accidentally.  It is easy to cover the lens with a finger because of the lens's location.All in all, I would recommend this a good, inexpensive pocket camera for anyone EXCEPT for those who mainly take candid action snapshots of their kids or friends.

The screen on the back is HUGE for such a small camera, which is great but I tend to get fingerprints all over it. It has tons of nifty features that lead to hours of fun.My only complaints are about the same as everyone else's: The On/Off button is right on top, and when you press it, the reaction is instant. I guess that's a good thing if you want your camera to turn on quickly, but it's easy to accidentally hit when taking a picture and if you keep it in your pocket or purse, it'll turn on and off all day and run the battery down. Also, there's a pretty big delay when you try to snap a picture. If you like spontaneous portraits of your kids, pets, or anything that won't sit still for long, this may not be the best camera for you. However, it's still a great camera and those things really haven't been a big problem for me.If you buy this camera and intend to use it often, I'd suggest buying an extra battery (make sure it's a genuine Nikon, or you'll void the warranty). To charge the battery, you must take it out of the camera and place it in the battery charger. A fully exhausted battery takes about 2 hours to charge completely.

The price was right and I'm sure it will be fine for what she will use it for.  I personally would not want to have this camera for the following reasons.  LCD monitor has horrible color recreation indoors.  If you have any florescent bulbs in your house (more and more people do), the green tinting of the objects on the monitor screen is terrible, especially lighter colors (white objects are green), it is better when only incandescent lighting is used but still noticeable.  The good news is that the auto white balance setting of the camera does do a good job in rendering the colors in the images themselves quite well.  Interesting enough, using the florescent or incandescent white balance settings of the camera for either condition produced very poor images (flash mode didn't help either). The colors are fine in the monitor when viewing the images in playback mode, it's just when taking them is there is a problem.  In addition, I'm not sure if it's the 3\" LCD screen or not, but as mentioned by others, the battery life seemed bit short to me. While certainly you can buy an extra battery, that's just something else you have to carry around with your pocket camera.  A viewfinder with an option to turn the LCD off might be a nice addition to this camera. Also, as mentioned, the images themselves are somewhat grainy even at the lowest ISO setting and the highest image quality settings.  This is very noticeable as full image size, but not as bad when viewing fit to screen on your monitor.  There are also sometimes some shadowing around the edges.  Truthfully though, I find the image quality to be fairly decent for a camera at this price and not something the point and shoot user should probably be concerned about.  I have not printed any of the pictures and I would say at a 5 x 7 size the graininess would be even less of an issue.  Also, as mentioned on other posts, the on/off switch is very sensitive and several times I have accidentally turned the camera on while in it's case just by picking it up carefully.  Also, the AF assist which flashes short burst of light to assist in focusing in low light situations will blind your subjects and is quite annoying.  It can be turned off, but you then may have issues focusing.  Also, the camera is very slow indoors.  Not as bad outdoors when AF assist and flash aren't needed. I can't imagine how someone could catch somebody blowing out candles. On the plus side, the camera is very slim and light and can be carried around quite easily. Again, the images are probably fine for the casual user.  I found the controls easy to manipulate, even for my fat thumbs (that was a concern of mine given the small size of the controls).  The menu system is fine, although backing out of mode screens is not as intuitive as I would hope, I'm sure that won't be an issue with a little practice. I have a digital slr but would like to buy a point and shoot for myself.  It won't be this camera for the reasons I've just given.  I bought my other daughter a Sony Cybershot DSW55 for Christmas and plan on reviewing that once I have a chance to play with it, probably within the next week or two.  I'm also looking at the Canon SD1000.  A co worker just got one and is supposed to bring in some pictures.  He knows a little something about cameras and said he was very happy with the SD1000.  As an update 4 months later, my daughter says she is no longer having the green lcd screen issue I mentioned above which is good.  I have not yet written the review on the Sony DSW55 because I'm just now getting it out of my daughters hand's to play with.  I will say that I'm very happy with what I've seen so far with it.  Great pictures, great color, auto settings work wonderful, and the it's also very easy to use the menus and such. I would definitely recommend the DSW55, and it's without a doubt a much better camera then this Coolpix in every respect.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!!!", "Author": "Leslie", "ReviewID": "R1ETLTXNGLHV6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first have to say...

I specifically wanted a non-retracting lens camera - simply because I wanted the most compact camera I could get (and didn't want to risk having someone knock over the camera if the lens was partly open). Oh - and I wanted something on the cheap. This fits the bill. If you are willing to spend more money, I think you can probably get a better camera -- but for what I wanted, I couldn't find another ultra-compact in the sub $250 range that I liked as much. For $225, I was able to get a camera, a 2 GB SD card (free thanks to some promo Amazon was running a few weeks ago) and an extra battery. Can't beat that.The LCD screen is gorgeous, works great in a variety of lighting conditions (including bright sunlight) and is HUGE. Although I'm a big fan of looking through the lens on DSLRs, I'm of the opinion that most of the viewfinders on compact P&S; cameras are less reliable than a LCD, so I would rather have a high resolution, bright LCD that works outdoors. The one downside of having a 3\" LCD is that the battery life is less than some other cameras. I picked up an extra battery when I purchased my camera and would recommend potential buyers to do the same thing. The battery does not charge in the camera - something I personally prefer - but know that you will need to buy a separate AC adaptor if you want to do that.The build quality of the camera is fine. It's mostly plastic, with some pieces of metal - and it's lightweight, but  if you are used to a heavier metal camera (like Sony features on their higher-end ultra compacts), I'm not going to lie, this feels kind of cheap in comparison. But at $200, I really don't expect it to feel like a camera that costs $160 more.This is not the fasted digital camera that I have ever used, nor is it the slowest. I had fewer issues with the speed than some of the reviews that I have read, mostly because it's the result of the auto-focus system doing its thing. You press and hold the shot button, wait for the AF sensor to turn green and then press again. The auto-focus is VERY good (even if you aren't using the facial recognition mode), so I'm fine with waiting another tenth of a second to take a shot. It's really not a huge thing.The image quality on the camera is quite good, once you become familiar with the controls. The macro mode is amazing -- for such an inexpensive camera, I was blown away. Fantastic. The flash is pretty bright, be weary of that when taking indoor shots, as it can often wash out the entire shot. The autofocus is great and the scene modes/white balance work as they should. Red eye is a problem - as it is for almost all compact digital camera. Fix that on your computer after the fact - but yes, it's definitely there.Straight out of the camera, the pictures and colors look very good. After some tweaking in Aperture or Lightroom (or iPhoto or the included Nikon photo software if you want to get less fancy), they look amazing. I put up some pictures from Thanksgiving on my Flickr page and someone was able to make out the photographs in the background of the original, even though it was partially obstructed by plant leaves, to know that it was an older picture of me.I can't speak for Windows (haven't used it with a Windows PC yet), but the camera works flawlessly with a Mac (I'm running OS X 10.5.1). I didn't install the Nikon software, preferring to use my other photo apps instead. Connecting the camera via USB is a breeze and the transfer from the SD card to the computer is very fast. I got a 2 GB SD card, but it supports up to a 4 GB card, and supports high-speed cards (well, it's been tested with certain brands, see the owner's manual).All in all, for the price - the camera can't be beat if you want something ultra-compact and with a large LCD. I only give it 4 stars because of the battery life and the fact that the build quality is on the plasticy side.
