{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unbelievable S2-P!", "Author": "Dr. Evan B. Siegel \"CA Leica Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RDJ73FZTHOQHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting with the Leica S2=P system for about 3 months. The lenses are the 180 mm, 70mm and 35 mm. They are all of superb quality and the image dynamic range, sharpness, color and complete lack of distortion are unreal, compared to any other system (including the Hasselblad 3D 39II) that I have used to date. While the repetition rate of the shutter cannot compare to a high-end DSLR, I find that 5fps or more is rarely needed and the capabilities, complete water-resistance, form-factor, battery life and made-for-your-hand aspects are synergistic with the image quality mentioned above. Although the pricing is sky-high, a serious photographer will find him/her self in a league above other shooting experiences. I have used this system all over Australia in all kinds of weather; whale watching in a zodiac, and in every climate and humidity situation likely to be encountered, without a hitch, in about 15 countries.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just a tad over priced.", "Author": "Jacob G", "ReviewID": "R2JAPCR975OHAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I'm sure this camera is absolutely fantastic, for the low price of 30,000$ dollars, I felt like I wasn't *quite* getting my money's worth out of it. I'm holding onto the hope that for this price tag, the camera will also:1. Tell me where the best locations worldwide are to capture Bigfoot on film.2. Teach me on proper viewing and lighting angles.3. Massage my eyeball while I work.4. Recharge itself from the powers of the sun.5. Teleport me to the moon.6. End the Middle East conflict by taking the perfect picture of a small Israeli girl holding a Palestinian flower.7. Transform into an AK-47 for wartime photographers stuck in sticky situations.Until these things happen, I just don't think a fifth star is warranted.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "a really excellent camera", "Author": "David Watson", "ReviewID": "R2WP7DISYTWNMC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a really awesome camera.My Mom bought me one for my birthday.All the buttons and stuff are confusing but im going to take a photography class to learn how to take gooder pictures.I hope it will do as good pictures as my iPhone in Instagram:-)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "It does everything", "Author": "LeicaFTW", "ReviewID": "R34HMDX1GPM15R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 2 weeks ago, and I was really impressed.  It is well worth the money, after I got it I just charged the battery and put the card in it and the camera flew itself to budapest and took an entire 64gb of excellent shots.  This is by far the best way to improve your career, because this camera will fy all over the world shoot interesting shots, handling composition, exposure and imagery all by it self.  I used to go to the photo shoots like a plebeian but now I hang out on the couch while my camera is out working.  I have a Nikon D800 that has about the same resolution, higher ISO, more autofocus and I could buy 10 of them for the same price, so I was dubious  about the price of this one, but when i realized it literally does the photography for me, i'd say it's the best piece of equipment I own.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Duke_Rufus", "ReviewID": "R1Q7B3YPCH17NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I seen this camera I couldn't belive the price! What a bargin. You have heard of the goose that lays the golden egg? Well this is it, but instead of a goose its a Leica S2-P 37.5MP Camera and instead of a golden egg its a hot steamy turd made of gold. When I opened the box and held it high above my head to show my neighbors what I sold my second modular home for it took the biggest sweetest golden dump right on my chest. If I was any more German I'd have died of joy. Simply an amazing camera. As soon as I can move the rest of my meth I'll be buying another one just for the rich Cleveland Steamers.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a camera of all times, even in a million years !!!", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R27VT1JPTS6DUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am speechless, I just got my new Leica & for the first time in my life, I feel stunned !!! a must to buy for every professional out there looking to improve his career.

I bought my children two each and they love using them in the summer. I have tons of pictures of my kids running through the sprinklers and playing with my dog. I am kind of upset they aren't water proof though. But every camera has its faults, right? Still, great quality and I feel like I can see every pore on my childs body (albeit kinda creepy). Great camera for the money! I'm looking to buy my 3rd one once I sell my trailer home.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "this camera blows", "Author": "R.
