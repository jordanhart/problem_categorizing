Shahi", "ReviewID": "R3KEB3G6WD63II", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after returning a Canon A95 that I purchased after a lot of research. I had returned A95 becasue the pictures were dull when viewing on the PC, so I was a little hesitant when I bought this Camera.Needless to sya, Olympus camera pictures were very good and very vibrant on the screen.  Pros and Cons I found on this camera were:Pros:- Very good quality pictures on the camera and on PC- AA Baterries use- No Software Required when importing to the PC- Quick Time Movie recordingCons:- No Optical Zoom, Only Digital Zoom. I found that when I used any zoom atall, the pictures were a little grainy.- Flash is a little weak. The camera took very good pictures when using from 4-5 feet. But beyond that the background was dark and the subject was semi dark..Overall, I gave this camera a rating of 4 stars. If you are on the budget this is a perfect camera for you. If you can spend a little you cann move up a few models on Olympus and get a model that will eliminate the Cons.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good. . .", "Author": "K.

Just make sure you get the memory card if you are planning to take a lot of high quality photographs, as this model does not come with one.  Otherwise, this camera is an excellent value.  And it's easy to handle, considering I have small hands, it works for me.", "Date": "March 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good starter digicam, but you need a tripod and lithium batteries", "Author": "Joseph A. Admire", "ReviewID": "R34ZETECWUNMXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the D425 last month and had my first chance to put it through a real workout last weekend when I took it to a research library and used it to make digital copies.  Two things are apparent:1) This camera really shines when you use it with lithium batteries - I took literally hundreds of pictures last Saturday and the machine was still going strong.2) If you are going to take pictures in an environment where you have to turn off the flash because it's unneccessary or prohibited, you really should use a tripod (there are several inexpensive models available that will fit just about any digital camera) in order to get sharp, steady pictures.  I found out by experience that using the camera purely as a handheld device just doesn't yield the very very fine level of quality that you need for delicate detail work such as making digital copies from books; next time I go, I'm taking a tripod with me.With those caveats, though, this camera is well worth getting for people new to digital photography or who just want something to snap shots with.  There are a LOT of features, though the controls take a bit of experimenting with to get used to, and as another commenter said, you really need to get at least one xD picture card to really get the most out of this unit.(UPDATE 7/9/06) - After over a year of using this camera and putting it through some pretty intensive use at research libraries and at major public events (including several big anime fan conventions where I took hundreds of photos), I find my opinion reinforced that this is a very good, very easy-to-use camera for people who want to get into digital photography but don't want to deal with the intimidating array of features that many more expensive cameras have.  I have to disagree with the other reviewer who asserted that the camera was bad for indoor use; it happens that I've taken most of my photos with this camera indoors, and I've rarely had a problem with focusing as long as I use the flash and remember to watch for the green light that indicates the camera has focused.  (If you're not using the flash - as I mentioned before - and you need to get a sharp picture, however, you really should use a tripod.)", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not a camera for a serious photographer", "Author": "chuckbobuck", "ReviewID": "RH74LZHVW5IH5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was on vacation about a year ago and slammed my digital camera in the car door. I was in the middle of Utah and my options were limited, so I bought the D425 as a quick replacement. I have to say that the photos I took with it were spectacular, mostly of landscapes and geological formations in bright sunlight. Since then I have been very disappointed with the performance of the camera. The shutter delay is horrible and I usually end up with pictures of my friends with distorted faces because they ask \"whats taking so long\" when the camera finally records the image. There are no bells and whistles on this camera and the overall performance is okay for a rookie but could sometimes be frustrating. My wife was so frustrated I had to buy another camera for her to use.", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Big Fan", "Author": "Dallas Moss", "ReviewID": "R3BKTSADBVW2JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for small size, simplicity, and high megapixel then this is the camera for you.I didn't buy my camera on amazon.com-- and i really should have. you really cant beat the price here! but i really love the camera; it's so easy to use, and that was key for me. i am not a beginner or anything, but rather just a fan of simplicity. and it definitely embodies that quality. it is perfect for people on the go-- its small and lightweight. i have a tiny purse and the Olympus D-425 fits in nicely.

It was a lot more then!  I absolutely love it still.  It takes AMAZING pictures.  I have several prints from pictures that I've taken on my walls as posters. What I like about it:  This camera takes great night shots.  All you have to do is hold it steady.  I have some amazing pictures of the beach under the full moon.  Since I first saw this sight I wished that I had a camera that would capture it.  I have dropped this camera down a mountain (Literally.  Broken Top Mountain in Oregon.) and it survived!  It also survived an ice storm, some glissading, and white water rafting that trip alone.  Other than that I've taken this camera spelunking, hiking, coast to coast, weddings, work, sporting events, and photos for non-profit organizations.  This camera is perfect for all occasions.I'm a college student (still) and this camera has made it through my drunken friends taking pictures, dropping it in beer, being in my HUGE purse and my backpack.  I've wrecked my bike and landed on it... it's been through a lot.  It looks like it wouldn't work, but it works like the day I bought it!The only downside to this camera is I take pictures on the largest resolution there is.  This makes the shutter a little slower so I don't always catch the perfect moment, but I'm still 99% satisfied!", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful!", "Author": "Jess", "ReviewID": "R29YUK02YVCOPN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera a few weeks ago, and I was wanting one that could do more things, just because I am a photo geek... but I love this one! It does everything I wanted it to do, except I haven't figured out how to set it up so it'll take a picture on a timer... I need to look though.Only thing I don't like so far is that the batteries the camera came with, lasted me about 2 hours, give or take, of continuous use... if I had taken this on a camping trip, I don't think it would've lasted an entire weekend on the original batteries. And there isn't a charger, but there is a place for one... so maybe there is one sold seperately.
