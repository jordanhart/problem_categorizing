The box and documentation has no company name or model number, bad sign. I was able to find the model # (RC531A-CM801CWAS1-4) on geeks.com, who is the provider of this product.After spending about an hour searching the Internet I was able to find no one who has been able to get it to work with Vista, Windows 7 x86 or x64. In addition, many people had issues getting it to work on multiple Windows XP systems. So the provided drivers are very poorly written and don't work with any operating system developed in the last eight years.Don't waste your time and money on this product. The idea behind it is good, but without drivers it's useless unless you want to hook up a composite/RCA monitor to it and watch the live feeds only. The only way to record video is on a computer.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$155.99", "Features": "Wireless Network DVR 4-Channel Real-Time Receiving 4-Channel Quad Picture\nImage color adjustable for each channel\nIncludes a 4-Channel Standalone DVR, 4 Infrared Cameras and Video Cables\nGreat for home, offices, parking lots, supermarkets, etc..", "Name": "2.4GHz Wireless 4-Channel Standalone Network DVR Home Digital Surveillance Kit w/4 Infrared Cameras & Video Cables", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41b6KWuOdSL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003S9NF66"}}
