Upon connecting it to our network I found that your browser has to have ActiveX to use it (not available for Linux).  This was not noted on the box.  What kind of idiot product designer uses proprietary protocols on a network device these days, anyway.Their response to my email about this pretty much amounted to 'so use windows'.I decided to leave it in place figuring that it was recording at least.Well we got robbed again, so I connected it directly to our monitor and plugged in the mouse and it doesn't respond to mouse input or any of the buttons on the front panel, so I don't even know if we have video.  We may have to take it apart to retrieve what video there may be from the hard drive.Don't buy one.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "H.264 DVR On This Product\nAll-Weather, High-resolution 480TVL Cameras\nUp To 65 Feet Night Vision\nRecords Continuously for 15 Days Or More\n500 GB Hard Drive", "Name": "Swann SWDVK-826004 8-Channel DVR with Smartphone Viewing and 4 CCD Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419Ii8aar2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004X13JE6"}}
