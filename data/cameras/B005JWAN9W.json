The insulation and wire appear to be well-made and I see no video quality or power loss over 50-100 foot runs compared to plugging the cameras directly into the dvr.  I fished them through the eaves and walls without any damage to the outer jacket.I paired them up with the male and female 2.1 adapters for power (link below).  The twist on BNC coax adapters (linked below) fit the jacket fine.  I finished off the connections with heat shrink tubing, but quality electrical tape would do the trick.Many people are going with ethernet cat 5 for the video cameras, but I didn't have any experience with it.  The traditional Siamese rg59 method worked great.10 Pcs 2.1x5.5mm Male Jack DC Power Adapter for CCTV Camera10 Pack 2.1mm x 5.5mm Female CCTV Power Jack AdapterTwist-On BNC Male Coax Connectors CCTV RG59 Pack of 10", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "CIB RG59-500FT RG59 Siamese Solid Coaxial Cable + 18/2 (18AWG 2C) Power, White, 500 ft, Spool", "Author": "Stuart C.

I filed a complaint with Amazon and tried to get the seller's contact info, but Amazon said the seller would just re-route me back to Amazon anyway, so I thought I was stuck. I wrote feedback to the seller, and they IMMEDIATELY contacted me to resolve the issue.  I am very impressed with the way they handled this situation and how important it was to them to resolve the issue.  I'm glad to see there are companies out there like this.  As for the cable itself, I'm sure it will be fine...  It's a simple RG59 with 18/2 power wire... And the seller did say they've been selling this product for several years with no complaints (about the 500' length or the quality of the wire) - and I trust them.
