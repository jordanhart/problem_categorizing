{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A dSLR that both a pro and a consumer can enjoy alike", "Author": "S. Sen", "ReviewID": "R1K9W39WCG94TG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a month and after using this, I felt compelled to write this review, especially after seeing some comments from first time SLR owners.My advice to them, please think carefully before buying a dSLR. If all you are going to do is set this camera in Auto mode and shoot, you are making a mistake, an expensive mistake. E-510 or any other dSLR is not designed to excel in this department, definitely not as good as an advanced P&S.;If you want better image quality (color, dynamic range, low noise at high ISO, interchangeable lens etc) and convenience (IS, more buttons, speed), DSLR is the way to go. With power, comes the responsibility. You should also be ready to take the challenge of trying out different settings and spend some time in post processing the RAW images. You can get dynamic range that no P&S; can match, if and only if, you are ready to spend the time on it. JPEGs straight from camera will not be significantly better, unless you tweak the settings for each situation perfectly.Most complaints about this camera are about focusing, under or over exposure. You have to learn how an SLR camera works. There are different metering and focusing modes and you have to choose carefully. Also you have to decide whether to shoot aperture priority or shutter priority based on situations. You can also choose whether to shoot for high key or shadow areas.No SLR in auto mode can give you a perfect shot of a person when the sun is behind him/her. Either use the proper P mode, or you use spot metering (or at least fill flash).When something is moving, shooting with slow shutter will also result in blurry image and an SLR expects that the person behind the view finder knows these basics. So my advice is, read the manual and try out all the options and find the modes that suit your needs.Also, the default ESP metering on this camera is a bit off. It's actually set to ESP + AF in factory. In my experience, if you change Menu2 > Metering to ESP, it works better. You might also consider turning the Noise Filter off for ISO 100 shots. It makes the images sharper (even with sharpness -2) and you can get details that you can't get in any other entry level camera at this moment. But, you might get some visible grains.What I like -1. IS, all my lenses are stabilized and I can get sharp shots sometimes at 1/30 when using focal length of 300mm in 35mm equivalent.2. Clean high ISO, up to 800 is completely usable with little noise reduction. ISO 1600 gives you better or same results compared to other brands, only Canon is half stop ahead.3. Image quality. The details with noise filter off, the color and the sharpness are wonderful. The dynamic range is not best in it's class, but with RAW files and a little time with Lightroom, it's not really an issue.4. SSWF. The dust buster in this camera works, unlike other brands (read Canon/Sony/Pentax). Never got a single dust peck on the sensor and I change lenses frequently.5. Live view. This is the only one in this class at the moment to have this feature. Another Olympus model, E-330 has it, but it was too expensive. This feature really helps when you have time and your eyes are tired. Also when you are shooting macro in an awkward position or using a manual focus lens and want to do precise focusing with the live view magnifier. This is a life saver for me that I can still use old manual focus lenses.6. The size, weight and ergonomics. With the kit lenses you get 28-300mm range covered and NO OTHER brand can get you this quality in this size and weight. D40x is as good in handling, but lack of IS (and the price/weight of their VR lenses) was a deal breaker.7. Speed. It's always ready for next shot. In drive mode, you can get 3 frames a second unlimited in HQ JPEG. With RAW, it's limited to 10 shots at the same speed and after that speed reduces to around 1.6 fps. Better than most in it's class if you have a fast card. I don't miss a shot these days due to camera.What I don't like -1. Though viewfinder is brighter than some previous Olympus models, it could be bigger. LV helps, but it's not usable always. A small issue considering my eyes aren't too bad.2. Focus confirmation using manual focus lenses. Though I didn't buy this camera for this purpose, it would have helped a lot. Especially when Panasonic L1 and Pentax models have it, it's just a software fix they have to do so I am hoping they'll release a firmware with this fix.These are just minor gripes and the second one is easily fixable. All in all, I would say this camera is a winner in the hands of a little experienced person, but a new owner will just need some time to get to know this little gem. IMO, it's the best camera in it's class today if you can live with the \"Made in China\" sticker on it.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Oympus E-510 D-SLR", "Author": "K. J. Larson \"Mentor/Facilitator\"", "ReviewID": "R3PLKPIAFMWM8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a professional photographer I have used Cannon and Nikon cameras.  I purchased an Olympus E-500 two years ago and was impressed with the sharpness, color capture, and other features.  Needing a second camera I tested several Cannon and Nikon pro-level cameras.  I found the Olympus E-510 equal or superior to each in edge-to-edge sharpness and color capture using color charts and sharpness charts.  Additionally, the ease of use of the E-510 was a contributing factor.  I am also impressed with the four-thirds system lenses produced by Olympus; they weigh less then their equivalent lenses in the Cannon or Nikor lines and I feel give better edge-to-edge sharpness. The only negative is the narrow line of pro-level lens in the Olympus line.I recommended the E-500 to my photography students and now I'll recommend the E-510 as the cost factor is important to students.  If you are looking for a solid D-SLR I highly recommend the E-510. I suggest that consideration be given to purchasing the Olympus \"high-grade\" lenses rather then the kit lens for the advanced photographer.  The kit lenses are fine for the consumer.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Low light focusing - Olympus, do you hear?", "Author": "Vlad G", "ReviewID": "R2J0NX8RLWOEB3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would give this camera five and a half stars, really, if not for one issue.And a pretty serious one.But first the good news: the camera is great.It works blazing fast, controls are excellent and so is the level of control.All important SLR options, all those many competitors usually \"reserve\" for \"professional\" models - like all metering modes, auto ISO limit, custom WB, mirror anti shock, remote control capability, manual focusing after AF and even shutter release priorities - are there.Anti-dust system and set of two lens gives you worry free 28-300 (10.7x) range, image stabilization works surprisingly good, widely rumored problem of dynamic range that is half EV below the competition is not visible in 99.95% of the pictures. The rest 0.05% requires microscope and 100% zoom  to point out the blown out highlight.All things considered - an excellent camera and value for money.Of course, there are many things one may complain about, like slow kit lens (and fast lens are available, but expensive) or aggressive noise filter at high ISO (and it could be turned off) or one second delay at start up (never bothered me much) etc. But all these issues are pretty minor and every camera has list of them.***Now the bad news - low light focusing. I just do not understand that.Here it is: below certain light level camera just struggles to get focus. That level is somewhat below standard living room illumination - so it does not bother many people in standard situations, but try to shoot at the dark bar or at the street in the evening - and change in camera behavior is dramatic. Suddenly it may take several seconds before focus is locked - way too long. Using flash to illuminate target does not help much - flash keeps strobing and strobing and strobing again and finally, when focus is locked it takes additional second to charge it for the shot. I rarely meet people who would stand still for that long... They think I made three pictures of them already, when I accomplished, well, none!I perfectly understand the technical issue of focusing in low light, but... I am old Olympus E10 owner - and it have never bothered me much with this issue. Cheap Canon A70 have never bothered me with this issue either - well at least nobody expects performance from $200 compact camera.May be these old cameras are not trying to get perfect focus when they cannot, may be they limiting time to some reasonable interval - I do not know, but Olympus should fix the problem. It is a show stoppers.For now I turn off AF illumination and switch to shutter release priority in low light situations - but I need to recognize it first. I prefer to have slightly out-of-focus pictures, than no pictures at all.

I ordered the kit Sunday evening, paid $8 for 3-5 business day shipping, and it arrived Wednesday afternoon, 2 days in my book.  I am a noob at digital SLR photography, though I have used older film SLRs, and was able to get some amazing fireworks shots last night using the 40-150mm lens on a tripod (M-mode, 8s, F16, ISO 100, SHQ JPeg).I am totally amazed at how easy it is to change settings. The buttons are well placed, at least for me, and the menus are very intuitive.  I \"glanced\" through the manual before the camera arrived and began shooting as soon as the battery was charged.  I've had nothing but fun, none of the usual frustrations with something new.It's a lot of money, but I can't believe it won't last me many, many years and the kit lenses are very good, though I'm already drooling for the EC14 (and an EC20 would be even better to double the range).If there is one negative I can think of it's getting used to shooting with 4x6 prints in mind. Oly uses a 4x3 format and that doesn't translate directly to a 4x6 sheet of paper.  Mind you, I don't print often, but it's something to consider, especially if some of your family/friends are computer shy.  :)The other negative might be the Master 2 software.  It is painfully slow, but does a good job for free software.  I personally use Picasa for most things and Paint Shop Pro when needed.EDIT: I just found out Amazon has a 30-day price guarantee.  This means I will be getting a nice $88 refund on my credit card.  Have yet to be disappointed with Amazon.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "R1RN5K1G309LVW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera after reviewing & trying out several different brands at local stores. Compared with the others, the only one I liked better in the hand was the N80, which is considerably more expensive & lacks anti-dust & body-based image stabilization. The viewfinder on this camera is smaller than you're used to if you've shot 35mm SLRs for years, but it's not bad.Now that I've been using this for a couple of weeks, I like it even more. The body-based image stabilization works well, I can hand-hold the long lens of the set (150mm) for a 1/20 second shot, and it comes out very clear, no visible shake. I can't really comment on the usefulness of the anti-dust capabilities, but have switched out lenses several times, & no dust spots are apparent on my shots. Image quality is great, but the Oly software is worthless. Terrible UI, and the included software that can do decent post-processing of the raw files is trial only. Photoshop Elements w/ Adobe's raw processing & batch conversion from the camera's ORF files to DNG's works great for me. The kit lenses are good, very comparable to old Zuiko lenses from the manual focus 35mm days. Fewer lenses are available for this system than for e.g. Canon or Nikon, but most of the needed lenses are out there. Only thing I really miss is a good fast prime (25mm f/1.4 or f/1.8 would be very appreciated, Oly!)

This camera will definitely keep the DSLR competition honest and only benefit us consumers!  I am thrilled to-date.

Boutilier \"Jim Boutilier\"", "ReviewID": "R6GMSTYLSY1J7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a long time photographer that places high value on construction quality and ergonomics,  My original search lead me to a Panasonic DMC-L1 and nothing I looked at in the $1000-$2000 range had the quality feel and traditional ergonomics of the L1.  For studio work I love the L1 but its size and weight make it a less ideal travel companion.One of the original premises of the 4/3 system was being able to offer high quality pictures from a system that was less expensive, smaller, and lighter.  Olympus seems to be offering several products that fit that premise.  The latest being the E-510The E-510 body is relatively light, very rigid and sturdy, with a quality feel.  The two kit lenses (14-42 and 45-150) have the same cheap, horrid feel of other \"kit\" lenses, but these are considerably smaller and lighter and of higher optical quality than most.  This two lens kit is capable of very high quality pictures over a large zoom range, while not taking up much space or weighing much.  Its ideal for travel where you want a DSLR instead of a SuperZoom.  Olympus offers plenty of high quality lenses and accessories if you want to make this kit the basis for a much larger system.  I've added an 18-180 lans and Fl36 flash to mine so far.The E-510 is as capable as anything else in its price range.  Why would you or wouldn't you want to purchase it over its competition?Pro's- System small size, light weight, and high quality- Effective Sensor self cleaning (don't underestimate this one)- Sensor based Image Stabilization  (a bit less effective than lens based but much cheaper)- Awesome battery life- Live viewCon's- 4/3 sensor smaller and intrinsically less sensitive than larger APS sensors- 4/3 viewfinder a bit dimmer and smaller making manual focus more difficult- Creative program modes not as well done as some of the competitionWhat's missing?- An auto ISO that permits 800 and 1600- A sports mode that senses movement and adjusts aperture and ISO to ensure a frozen image- Permit base changes of creative mode settings (currently lost when you leave and reselect a creative mode)All of these missing things could be addressed in a firmware upgrade.

Lennon", "ReviewID": "R78E1VB7RE9YH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera (with the 2 lens kit) for about a week now and have spent this time getting to know it. It's exactly what I expected - which is a good thing. The IS works well - don't expect too much though, a tripod is still required in many situations - and the good performance at high ISOs (something previous Olympus dSLRs were often criticized for) combined with this gives you more options in more situations. People who have owned the e-500 have consistently said that the high-ISO prformance on the e-510 is much improved. I cannot comment on this or make a comparison, but I do think that the high-ISO performance (and many people underestimate how important this is) is excellent and the equal of its competitors.Liveview works as advertised, it takes some getting used to due to the special properties involved but can be very useful in some situations (i.e. macros (which I don't take) or low-light situations w/ tripod using MF on the liveview zoom). It is also very nice being able to see a live histogram. The LCD screen doesn't tilt out but again, truth in advertising, you can see it well in direct sunlight (if a little dark) and indoors you can see it at ridiculous angles. It is important to remember, however, that this does not work in the same way as it does on a P&S.; The mirror must flip up in order for the camera to focus, resulting in lag times that are often longer than the typical compact camera. One of the main advantages of a dSLR is the speed that can be achieved both for focusing and framing shots. In other words, for those of you taking a step up to dSLRs, this camera is not meant to be used using Liveview as the main way to set up your photos. What it is, is another option providing you with more flexibility and the possibility of getting certain shots that would be difficult/impossible without it.Image quality in my opinion is quite good. In many reviews you are advised to turn off the Noise Reduction, and decrease sharpness (-2) to compensate and after fiddling around with these settings I agree. Remember to decrease sharpness across the board (Vivid, Muted etc). I would recommend only using noise reduction for very long shutter speeds.The 3-point AF can seem limiting at first but if you take the time to frame your shots properly it is no hindrance. If anything it's making me consider this all important aspect more than I used to. And in other situations, when you don't have much time, the simplicity of it can be an advantage. Less is sometimes more. Focusing in dark lighting conditions can sometimes be difficult. In these circumstances, when stability is available, I like to use the LV enhancement + MF.It is a comfortable camera to hold, and I especially like the ability to not only use the wheel but the 4-point controller to set things up while looking through the viewfinder. Once you get the hang of the menu layout it is actually much faster. 4/3 system makes sure both the body and the lenses don't break your back. Whether or not you like what this system offers, is a matter of personal choice. I use my camera almost exclusively for street and travel photography and so for me the decision makes itself.The user interface is very intuitive, and I must say is a huge improvement over the last Olympus I owned (the C-8080wz - an absolutely fantastic P&S; btw). It must be said that the excellent impression the previous Olympus I owned left on me was a factor in deciding to go for Olympus again this time.RAW+SHQ are huge. I can fit 81 on a blank 2GB card. So make sure you have sufficient space. Write times are very good and the buffer space is excellent. I personally do not have a need for continuous shooting but those of you who do will be happy with this camera's capabilities. Battery life is also another plus, it takes a while to charge, but lasts very long.Canon and Nikon will always dominate the market but thankfully there are other companies pushing the envelope in other directions, which ultimately benefits us, the consumers. And Olympus is foremost among them.With excellent image quality and good high ISO performance, a quality build (though it uses plastic it feels much less \"plasticky\" than much of the competition), the best kit lenses available, good ergonomics and low weight and a (in my opinion) very user friendly menu system, the e-510 is a fantastic camera and I do not hesitate to recommend it. Personally, it is ideal, for the type of photographer I am and the types of pictures I take. But combined with its trifecta of features not offered (together) on any other dSLR in this price range (liveview, IS in body, effective dust reduction), Olympus have really hit a home run.I wonder what the reaction (and sales) would be like if Canon or Nikon produced a camera like this.

After reading the full hands-on of the E410 from dpreview I pulled the trigger (since I'm on vacation this week). Just got back from Yosemite, shooting in automatic mode at SHQ (3648x2736) operation was easy even though I'm a DSLR newbie and I was mostly hiking not photogging.Performance is quite phenomenal compared to my Camedia from 1998. . .  I tried doing quick panos by shooting in full auto (~3fps) and just spinning in place (taking around 25 frames in 8 seconds). Two panos this way came out great, the third one I started on a shadowed area so the rest came out overexposed.I've got the 8GB Extreme IV CF card in it, so the camera has a capacity of ~1000 SHQ shots.Battery life so far is decent; one charge lasted all day yesterday, at least.Zoom range on the shorter kit lens was acceptable.

I finally decided to reenter the SLR market and after much online research, settled on the Olympus E510.I have taken several hundred photos with this camera since I purchased it and have been quite pleased with the results.The reviews I read panned the camera's ability to focus in low light and I have found that to be a shortcoming, but unfortunately I can't compare that with other digital SLR cameras so I don't know if it is Olympus-specific or how Olympus compares to other cameras.  It still tends to get the job done for me.Just a couple nights ago I had to use the camera with no flash at an indoor dance recital at a local high school.  Expecting low light, I manually set the ISO (film speed) to 1600 and managed to get some nice shots using no flash, a 300mm (equivalent) zoom, the anti-shake setting and hand-holding during dance routines.  The photos weren't perfect, but I got some keepers of my grandaughter, something I couldn't do with my point and shoot.Beyond that, I added a circular polarizer which has really enhanced my outside photos.By experimenting in flourescent and various outside lighting conditions, I also determined that white balance may be the most critical setting in the camera to arrive at proper exposure.  Generally, I have found that in outdoor photography, using the shade white balance setting yields better looking photos than using the automatic white balance setting.There are many adjustments and settings available with this camera (infinitely more than in my old film SLR cameras) and it takes time to try them out to arrive at the best balance of settings, but the time is well-spent in my judgment.  The extensive control the camera gives the operator means that I will have many years of fun tinkering with settings.The kit lenses which come with the camera are very nice and photo quality is excellent.I have even tried (for the first time) using RAW format just to see what that is all about.  Frankly, I have found that if I get the white balance set correctly and use high resolution, my photos are so good that RAW format adjustments make no significant improvement over the original.  You can check that out for yourself by using the mode that saves both JPEG and RAW photos of each shot.  That is too space consuming for regular use as you will fill up your compactflash card (RAW files are 10 MB and highest quality JPEG files are about 6 MB).One note -- the kit does not come with memory cards to store your photos.  So I was fortunate to have an old Olympus memory card until I was able to buy some high capacity compactflash cards.  Had I paid more attention, I might have bought a compactflash card at the outset as well.  You might also consider ordering a second battery as you can't just slide a couple AA's into it, you have to have an Olympus or compatible battery.  And it takes 5 hours to charge a battery using the kit charger, so you don't want to run out of power.  Compatible batteries cost about $20 at Amazon.This is a very good value for a digital SLR overall.SUPPLEMENT:Since I reviewed this item, a very new extensive review at dpreview.  That is a great source to get an exhaustive explanation of the camera's capabilities and see how it compares to other cameras.Also, setting white balance for particular conditions is a snap.  It involves a couple button presses and pointing the camera at a white sheet of paper or white cloth -- the white balance is based on the white object and so there is automatic and accurate correction for whatever the ambient light is, whether sun, shade, tungsten, or one of the many different temperatures of fluorescent.Live View was a great asset in composing photos of my grandkids for Christmas cards. I put the camera on a tripod and used Live View to put the girls where I wanted them and fired away.

It took me about 4 months to get that far.  So I'm writing this to help ease the tortoured minds that are like my own, and research to death what camera to buy.A few things to note about the Olympus E-510.  Right out of the box, the camera is going to take better pictures than that 5 megapixil point and shoot you are thinking of advancing from.  I like RAZOR sharp pictures.  The pictures you get with this camera are modestly sharp, but I usually run my pics through PICASA or ACDSee and hit the sharpen button once or twice.  I have compared pictures from all the available cameras in this price range.  Nikon D40, D40X, Canon Xti, Pentax K10D and K100Super.  After all the research I went to buy the Pentax K10D and came home with the Olympus E-510.When you hold the camera, use the controls, and explore all the setting options, you can't help but love the camera.  The built in Image Stabilization and live view pushed me over the edge to buy.Strong Points:1) I use the live view more for tripod work with wildlife in by back yard; and frequently for setting the white balance, then shooting normally.  I really like that option.2) When I considered the Xti and the lens I wanted, it was almost twice the price of the E-510.  I considered the Pentax K100Super, but didn't want to go back to AA battery thing again.  An option if you are on a really tight budget.  The K10D?  I found the controls, and speed it took to change them on the K10D its downfall, though a rugged camera and still a good choice if you are leaning in that direction, again I went to the store to buy this camera.3) ISO 1600;  the camera takes good natural light pictures with ISO 800 and 1600.  A couple sample pictures were taken that way.  I'm impressed.4) Most complaints about this camera are about focusing.  I have not experienced any \"hunting\" with focusing, but rather some dark conditions with little contrast will make the built in flash strobe for up to 5 seconds prior to locking and shooting.  I don't consider it a problem, but rather how my camera works.  I accept it, its rare.  I would not buy a different camera based on this.5) Under or over exposure. This is probably my only complaint about the camera. I find myself using the exposure compensation when shooting indoor flash photos when the subject is more than 10 feet away.  I don't understand why they cant program the camera to increase the exposure compensation when the subject focused at a distance, or the lens is zoomed.  The data is collected by the camera, why don't they use it so I don't have to compensate for it?  If I forget to compensate, the pictures are never lost to quality, I just have to tweak them in Picasa or some other photo program.6) Image Stabilization.  In the bleachers of the gym at my local school, I can turn to ISO 1600, turn on the IS, full out zoom and still get a nice shot at 1/30th.  It's the real deal.  No complaints.7) Image quality. The details with noise filter off, the color and the sharpness are wonderful. The dynamic range is the same as the Pentax K10.  White whites and black blacks is the issue here.  I like BRIGHT and slightly over saturated pictures, which means I tend to over expose them in the photo programs.  You will notice you clip the whites out when you do this, but no worse than any other manufacturer when comparing photos all over PBASE.8). SSWF. The dust buster in this camera works.  Didn't buy it for this, but it's a bonus.9) I never use the scene modes.  If you are inexperienced, you may want to use these options.  I bought the camera because I loved film in the 1980's and wanted to get back to a SLR.  I like shooting with spot metering and spot focusing, by sticking it right on the center of some ones nose, then dropping down to frame my shot.  I like taking a picture across a gym filled with kids, not knowing which one is my kid, but getting a clean shot that can be cropped into what I wanted.  If this is the fun you expect to have, you will be happy.Sometimes a full kit package with two lenses for under 700 bucks really is a deal, and a great camera.  I would buy again.  Have fun.Update Dec 2008: Still happy with my purchase, about a year or more out.  No problems with the camera.  Firmware upgrades are offered from time to time.  My only complaint (inherant to most digital SLR's) is the dynamic range compared to film of years past.  Whites are bleached out in outdoor pictures in sunlight or black dogs are two dark, then whites are bleached out when compensated.  The 520 has shadow compensation in camera, I suspect this helps compensate.  With newer models out, the 510 package has become an even better value.Update March 2010: over 5000 pictures taken; still like this camera; considering the 50-200 lens for inside shooting without flash at sporting events.

HOWEVER, in the entry level DSLR category, this Olympus E510 blows the D40 away and here's why:- For roughly the same price, you get two compact, high quality lenses from Olympus- The basic Nikon D40 does NOT have image stabilization and the E510 does. This means that at the end of shooting anything, you'll have way more in-focus, clear, and usable shots with the Olympus- The Live-View mode helps you get the white balance closer to natural on the Olympus E510 (Nikon D40 does not have this)So, if you're on the fence about the Nikon D40 versus Olympus E510, GET the Olympus E510.

But I had one big advantage: I had previously purchased a Canon Rebel XT about a year ago and found that I was not at all happy with the camera. The image quality was very soft, and I ended up selling the thing on ebay. In general, I found that Canon is waaay over-rated and in order to get good pics you have to shell out at least as much coin for non kit lenses as you do for the bloody body. Canon and Nikon SLRs are, in my mind, a racket for lenses.That's where Olympus came into the picture. I had previously owned a Olympus C-765 10x zoom non-SLR camera and was generally pleased with the results. Particularly, I was pleased with the optics of the lenses at the long end of the zoom spectrum. It's all about the lenses, stupid!! So, in my mind, when it came to the next SLR purchase, it came down to Sony and Olympus. I picked the E-510 because it came with two lenses, had all the current features, and pretty much was getting rave reviews.I am very glad I purchased the E-510. The lenses have not disappointed. The image quality is clear and concise and detailed - something that my Canon XT kit with kit lens was definitely not. For anybody just getting into digital photography, like myself, I would recommend the E-510 because of the lenses and quality pics you'll get without having to spend a ransom on lens upgrades. Other things I like about the E-510 are: the user-friendly menu system, the feel of the camera - it feels like a substantial, professional tool, the anti-dust mechanism and built-in anti-shake, the long battery life. It's just an excellent camera that gets SLR results. Again, can't say the same for the Canon XT.Don't believe all the hype about Canon, for sure, and probably Nikon. I don't know why Olympus doesn't more aggressively market its products, because I find it to be a superior camera? The company is, after all, in the business of making high-powered microscopes and optical equipment. I have found that the lenses are high quality and will give you great image quality. I am very happy with my E-510 and now getting so excited about my new hobby that I am considering buying the 70-300 Zuiko lens to get really close-up shots. Bottom line: buy the 2-lens kit E-510 and you'll get great pics, have a feature-ladden camera, and won't have to throw away your kit lens and pay big bucks for a new lens right away.

When Olympus announced the E-510 with its Image Stabilizer (IS) built into the body, I knew I had to upgrade.  Any lens I had or purchased would have IS!  I cautiously read all the early reviews...all positive.  So I took the plunge and bought the body (a friend bought my E-500 and is as happy as I was with it).  The IS allows for the capture of shots that my unsteady hands would have mucked up.I have not been disappointed.  I am currently putting the camera thru its paces, but it has performed remarkably well.  I will be taking it to a night football game and other activities.  I also took several indoor pictures at a seminar I attended...and the lighting in those rooms are not conducive to obtaining good images.

Hopefully it will save you time and trouble.When researching online stores to purchase this camera kit the lowest price I found was $527 at Broadway Photo. I carefully read the details, mainly which items were included in the box. Everything in the description matched the list of items \"included in the box\" on the Olympus website, so I felt reasonably certain that it was an identical kit. Broadway Photo even threw in a \"bonus\" that included a tripod, cleaning kit and protective film for the LCD screen. I went ahead and placed the order with my Discover card. I opted for Overnight Shipping because the site stated that the camera would ship in 1 - 2 business days and I was trying to get it before the weekend.The \"receipt\" that was emailed to me lacked any detail regarding my order, including the price paid for the camera package and shipping ($42.00 for overnight shipping). My order total should have been $569, a considerable savings over any other site offering the camera. The receipt also stated that I needed to make sure that my credit card company had any alternate shipping addresses on file. I called Discover to verify that my work address was on file - it was. I was trying to avoid any last minute calls from Broadway Photo that might delay my order.The next day I got a phone call from Broadway Photo \"verifying\" my order. The salesman on the phone also wanted to make sure I didn't need any accessories and was aware of a few things with this particular camera package - namely that the battery was a lower-life battery, the charger was a 12 hour charger and the warranty was only 90 days. He offered a better deal, a long-life battery, a 15 minute charger and a 1 year extended warranty from Olympus for an additional $100. I usually don't go for any bait and switch tactics, but I knew an extended Olympus battery and a quick charger were around $140, and I thought it would be convenient having a charger at work and at home. Against all better judgement, I agreed.When my package arrived I got the standard camera kit and a TINY box with a TINY tabletop tripod (made up of flexible bendy legs), lens cleaning kit and LCD protective film. The extra battery and charger were missing. The receipt said that the battery and charger were an \"UPGRADE\" and there was no mention of an extended warranty. I opened the camera box thinking they may have stuffed the charger and battery inside, only to find the standard Olympus battery, charger and standard ONE YEAR WARRANTY. I also noticed that Broadway Photo added an additional $40.50 to my order as a \"HANDLING\" charge, for a total of $709.50 - a $140.50 jump from the original $569 order. I gave Broadway Photo a call.I figured that Broadway Photo dealt with gray-market goods (units that may have different features and accessories which are packaged to be sold outside of the U.S. that are being sold within the U.S. market at a discount) - but I was told that the extra $100 was for a SECOND battery, SECOND charger and extended warranty - not the standard issue items that came with the U.S. camera kit. I felt like I was still getting a good deal. The customer service rep explained that the Broadway Photo website plainly stated that they sold \"overseas units\" and when I asked \"gray-market goods?\" he said \"Oh no, NOT gray-market goods - units packaged for sale overseas\". I told him that was the textbook definition of a gray-market good. I told him I felt like Broadway Photo was using bait and switch tactics which he also denied. He told me that the package that was advertised included a shorter life battery and 12-hour charger that Olympus packaged for overseas sales and the UPGRADE was legitimate - even though the web page made no mention that the E-510 kit was packaged for sale overseas. I asked about the 90-Day Warranty vs. the standard 1-Year Warranty and he said the 90-Day warranty was not from Olympus but from an outside vendor. Ahhhhh, so the camera kit wouldn't even be warranted by Olympus because it wasn't made to be sold in the U.S.I told him I wanted to return the entire order because I didn't trust Broadway Photo and he said that I would have to pay all return shipping charges and I would not get my shipping and handling charges refunded, BUT, he was willing to send me a true 3-year Olympus extended warranty because he wanted to keep my business. I said the only way he would keep my business would be to send me the 3-year warranty, the extra OLYMPUS battery and the 15-minute charger as I was promised. I also pointed out that Discover would charge-back Broadway Photo for the $82.50 shipping and handling charges so I had nothing to worry about. He said that I had the Olympus battery and charger because they were shipped as an \"UPGRADE\" to my order, and that the units which originally should have shipped with the kit I ordered off the website were made by after-market manufacturers. I told him to go ahead and send me those instead and I would keep the package. The customer service rep said he couldn't ship the extra battery and charger unless I was willing to pay $24 PLUS shipping and handling - yet another upsell - so I had him issue an RMA number.I sent the unit back and Broadway Photo did promptly credit my Discover card with everything but the shipping and handling fees -just as I was told. I called Discover and explained the situation and they credited my account with the rest of the charges. Ultimately my fiasco with Broadway Photo cost me $18 to ship the camera back.

Quality kit lenses. Great feature set including a decent 'auto' mode all the way to full manual operation. Super battery life - my first charge lasted over 5 shooting sessions of around 100 photos each. I didn't run the battery until it completely died either - I just didn't want to push my luck. :)I'm transitioning from a fairly good point-and-shoot camera to a digital SLR. I wanted a camera that would give me more control but I was a bit concerned at the potential complexity of digital SLRs. The Olympus e510 provides a good tool for learning better photography at my own pace. I've moved from relying on the 'auto' mode to using the manual settings much more often and have taken some really good shots that were simply not possible with my other cameras. Like many others I looked at Canon and Nikon before making my purchase and have no disappointment at choosing the Olympus.What it isn't: Despite the \"live view\" feature, the Olympus e510 is not a point-and-shoot camera. If you're transitioning from the point-and-shoot world and expect to be able to use the view screen on the camera for composing all your shots you will likely be disappointed. Reviews of the camera do point this out so I was aware of this before making the purchase.Other reviews point out that the 510 does experience some difficulty focusing in low light situations. I have found this to be true when shooting in full auto mode, especially with the 40-150mm lens. You can overcome this \"issue\" by learning to use some of the more advanced features of the camera.Bottom line: If you are looking to make a transition from the point-and-shoot world to digital SLR photography, the Olympus e510 shouldn't disappoint. The 510 pairs excellent kit lenses with a quality camera body with a wide array of features.

Menzel", "ReviewID": "R236YAXXX731KD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait a few weeks before giving what I feel is a very unbiased review of this camera. I have followed in the footsteps of many of the reviewers on here in my search for THE dslr. I've scoured review sites and viewed hundreds of pictures comparing the various companies. It came down to a few cameras (Olympus E510, Canon xti and 30d , Nikon d80 and d200 )My final decision:Olympus e510... Why?? Why when all of these other cameras have reputation upon reputation.Canon: No IS without the purchase of $500+ lenses, The good ol error 99 message that a lot of users seem to get(sometimes requiring a major repair), Dust removal system has been proven very inadequate. Picture results can have various issues with banding etc. NO Pixel mapping without sending it in.The positive is obviously the amount of glass and accessories available. It has been argued but the \"competitive\" priced glass that Canon produces while functional is not of very good quality (the ol get what you pay for issue) .Nikon : NO AF without the newer lenses, An inferior dust system, No IS, Banding issue that they can't seem to fix, No pixel mapping without sending it in and poor ISO at higher speeds (except the pricier models)Again there is plenty of glass and accessories but you must use the newer pricier stuff to get any AF whatsoever.So now the Olympus.The picture quality is nothing short of amazing. Yes the consensus is that it does require tweaking out of the box to get excellent results. This can be said for any manufacturer across the board.-The included lenses in this kit far exceed those of any other included kit. Have in mind this isn't the fastest glass on the market. Please don't expect studio type results at 4.0 in lowlight. (I've learned this myself) They also include the lens hoods ($30 or more saved)- The amount of pictures on a fully charged battery 650. Most competitors are in the 350-400 range. The drawback is a whopping 5 hr wait for it to recharge (a spare may be necessary)-Settings upon settings upon setting. While this camera has a slew (28) of auto program style modes for those making the switch from point and shoot it also has a ton of tweakable manual settings for those looking for a little more. You can even program your own WB for specific shots.-A proven superior dust removal system-A proven superior IS system (providing 4 stops)-A function that I have really enjoyed is being able to take a shot and then view the same shot with a little overexposure and one with a little underexposure to pick the best one.-The body is very stout and slightly bulky by my standards. It def. feels like a real camera. I will say the turn knobs are a bit plastic and cheesy.-Manual focus is a little slow as it is motorized. This has taken some time to get used to.-There is some noise in the higher ISO range.This is common and on par or superior to most unit in the price range. While it doesn't affect anything on a smaller 5x7 or less I could see it being an issue on larger prints. I feel this could be fixed getting faster lenses.-I have experienced the AF lowlight complaint that others have mentioned. Sometimes the flash will strobe constantly and never take a shot, sometimes it will focus in and out and never take a shot. I have found  this is primarily in full auto mode. This may be very frustrating for those switching from a point and shoot expecting the camera to take pictures with the same results. I have found switching to a different option provides desired results (tweaking is necessary) The AF has also had issues with my black dog in moderate to low light. Again this was in AUTO mode. Once I made the switch to another option all was fine.I really feel that this is a superior camera, far superior than those in its class . The complaints I read and can forsee would def. be of those inexperienced looking for immediate results. Take the time to really learn about light and exposure and really unleash the potential of this unit. Again for those looking for a quick turn on and shoot camera this probably isn't for you.I also agree that the current line of lenses is very expensive. I also realize that this same quality of glass in any line is expensive. Olympus clearly doesn't want to put a budget line out there of inferior quality.There are available adapters which allow you to use lenses from other manufactures(not canon) on this body (only in manual mode) .One final thing that I found very important. After about 60 or so shots I started to notice a nice red pixel on a few of my pictures. Fearing the worst I started to do a little research and found this to be described as a hot pixel. ALL manufactures have this issue and while there are some claims of specific times is occurs there isn't a  clear answer. Again this happens to ALL digital cameras .I soon found out that Olympus has really stepped up to combat this and has installed pixel mapping in this camera. Check with canon ..nope you have to send it off at your expense. Nikon ..same and sometimes it doesn't get fixed..This alone is worth $100+ in a shipping and repair bill.Hope this helps ...", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Improved Camera,", "Author": "J.

In good light, there is virtually no shutter lag and the camera can shoot several frames per second to follow action.* Battery Life - Even shooting flash photos the camera's fully-charged battery is good for hundreds of shots.* Dual Memory Cards - With a high-capacity CF and xD card, it's possible to have 130GB of removable solid state memory inside the camera.* LCD Display - You can view the actual sensor image on the LCD display.  While displaying photos on the LCD that you have already taken, you can rotate the camera and the images automatically remain upright.  I have not seen those two features on any other brand of digital SLR.* The July 2008 issue of Consumer Reports gave this camera its \"Quick Pick\" and a top overall score among basic SLRs, yet this model was priced less than most other cameras they tested.There may also be three reasons for not buying this camera:* Lens Mounts - A pro who constantly changes lenses may feel that metal lens mounts are more durable than the polycarbonate mounts that this camera uses, though the Olympus mounts should be durable enough for most amateurs.* Existing Lenses - A serious photographer who owns a collection of 35mm lenses that fit another brand might want to consider a camera of the same brand with a full-size sensor.  However, such a camera would be much larger, heavier and a great deal more expensive.* Two newer model of this camera, the E-520 and the E-620, have been introduced and are available at a higher cost.

Bailey \"SomeAssemblyRequired\"", "ReviewID": "R1PQIEY8HJGSZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, it is a great camera.  Rated number one by Wired magazine, and getting good marks from consumer reports should give you confidence that you won't be disappointed. It has taken me a couple of days to figure out the settings, but now I've got it mostly down.  I have owned two other Olympus cameras, so the menus are not difficult for me to navigate. Here are some simple differences between this SLR and others I have used or seen used.Positives:  1: The image stabilization is fantastic.  This is built into the CCD shift system, which includes the dust removal. Everything I read says that  the E-510's system is better than the similarly priced competition.  And I agree.  2: The four-thirds camera lenses are easier to make sense off. All Zuiko lenses are designed for this camera with auto focus. If you are pricing other cameras online it is a painful amount of research to find out exactly which lenses are bundled with what and whether they are auto focus or not. Skip the hassle, Zuiko's are reasonably priced and are all designed for the E series in mind. In addition, the lenses do not need image stabilization because it is already built into the camera.  3: The live view screen is a great feature in a camera this price.  4: The two memory card slots.  Having a CF and xD slot is a feature that really stands out. Though it does have some negatives (3).  5: The battery life, pretty much kicks it.  650 shots per charge!Negatives:  1: The manual focus. I saw this discussed in several other reviews, and it is difficult to use. Generally I vary my focus points in still life, and it is difficult with this camera. From what I understand, the focus ring activates a motor to change focus.  After 5 weeks I am still at a loss as to how it works.  2: Low light auto-focus.  The camera really 'hunts' for focus in low light situations. Other SLR's have separate focus lights, which are vastly better.  Frankly, it is a bit tiresome to have the flash strobe during the AF mode for over 5 seconds before a shot. It really drives me nuts. When I can take a quicker shot with a point and shoot than with my SLR I get frustrated.  3: Some modes do not work with the CF card. The xD card has some special formatting for panoramas that the CF does not. I was fully aware of this prior from owning a C-5060 wide zoom, so it wasn't really a negative for me.  But, it should be considered during purchase.  If you do panoramas and would like to use the Olympus Master software, you need a xD card.  4: Button clutter. My C-5060 was the same deal, so not like I wasn't expecting it. The problem is Winter shooting. When I have gloves on I cannot tell if I hit a button by mistake. This caused mass frustration a couple of days ago when I carefully set the camera up inside, went outside and had to redo it all in the cold.  Overall I feel like the negatives are more whining than real negatives. But I think if you are going to invest in a camera, knowing what is annoying is probably more useful than knowing what is good.  I probably would have been overjoyed to have any SLR, but the three positives really pushed me over the top. When I was shopping doing price comparisons of Nikon and Canon SLRs I could not make heads or tails of all the abbreviations for lenses and which legacy lenses worked with which camera. Every kit was different, and without tea leaves or a real camera nut on your side figuring it out takes time, time, time.  If you buy from a retail store and pay a $100 premium or get a more expensive model, this won't be a problem. But, if your a deal hunter like I am, be careful about what lenses are bundled. Also, because I already owned multiple CF and xD cards, it made sense for me to stick with a camera that actually used them.  You really won't find yourself using the live preview like you would on a point and shoot, but for landscapes and night-shots with a tripod I couldn't see not having it.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "If you're deciding whether to upgrade to a DSLR...", "Author": "Ken Yeh", "ReviewID": "R2G4B98MFS7PCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never saw the need for a DSLR camera. I was perfectly happy with a good quality compact camera, like the Canon SD800IS that I've been shooting with. My thought was, an SLR is so big and bulky that I wouldn't want to bring it with me to take pictures, defeating the purpose of getting one in the first place. All that changed with the birth of our son, when Grandpa offered us an Olympus E-510 DSLR as an \"encouragement\" to take good pictures of his grandchild.  Many other photography review sites offer very detailed and favorable reviews of this camera, and if you want the nitty-gritty of how this camera works and an explanation of all the features, you should just search for those reviews. I just want to give three reasons why I--previously an ardent anti-SLR user--have now been favorably swayed by the Olympus E-510.1. The E-510 is one of the smallest and lightest DSLRs currently on the market. Both the 14-42mm and the 40-150mm Zuiko digital lenses that come in the kit are incredibly small and lightweight. Note that with the Four-Thirds standard, you need to double the focal length of the lens when comparing to the typical 35mm lens; thus the 40-150 mm kits lens delivers a field of view comparable to a 80-300mm lens.  Yet even with such a high zoom range, the lens is compact and balanced on the camera, and it doesn't feel like a lead weight when hanging around your neck. You still can't beat the simplicity and portability of a digicam, but the E-510 trumps any digicam in the next area...2. The picture quality really is a marked improvement over my Canon SD800IS, which is already one of the higher quality digicams out there.  The sharpness of details and color rendition, even when I lowered the resolution of the E-510 to match that of the digicam, was extremely impressive. The kit lenses that come with the E-510 also do an excellent job of avoiding the distortion around the edge of an image that plague my digicam at wide-angles. Whereas I had to spend some time with photo software tweaking pics from a digicam to make them look good, pictures taken with the E-510 looked great direct from the camera, and they looked even better with slight processing. The ability to shoot RAW and do some intensive post-processing is something that you cannot do with any digicam.3.  When taking pictures of babies and kids, speed is key.  I've missed plenty of shots on my digicam due to the shutter lag, even when I prefocus by holding the shutter button halfway. The E-510 is fast in autofocusing (in good lighting), shutter lag, and it also has an excellent 3fps continuous burst mode. This can make the difference when trying to catch the quick smile or facial expressions of my child. Note that, as other reviewers have mentioned, the E-510 struggles with autofocusing in low light conditions, but you can always resort to manual focus. The camera offers a focus confirmation light in the viewfinder that illuminates even in manual focus mode when you achieve proper focus.There is much more for me to learn about this camera. But if you're torn between jumping up to a DSLR from a digicam, hopefully these reasons can help you with your decision.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worthy successor to the brilliant OM series", "Author": "NWS", "ReviewID": "RYMF5HDXKWLAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had several 35mm Olympus OM cameras I know Olympus quality and \"thinking\" well. This is not a \"me too\" company. I'd been holding off on a digital SLR because the others I'd tried were big, awkward and a bit too gadgety. The four thirds concept is brilliant. It's a clean sheet-designed for digital-format, not adapted from 35mm format.Why everyone is trying to emulate the 35mm format beats me. It was an odd format in film (it's based on movie film stock) and old thinking. It makes for big digital SLR's and lenses.This may sound like a trivial point but this is a camera meant to be held. The grip and balance are near perfect. It feels like a thick OM. Bravo, Olympus.The JPEG quality is excellent by default and better with fiddling with the settings. The images don't have that digital processed look. There's no problems at all with RAW and Adobe. It converts well.The popup flash is as good or as bad as the others, depending on your perspective. None pop up high enough to not cast a shadow of the lens up close and all are a bit harsh. Cobble up a diffuser to spread the light and all is well.The menus system is simple and direct. No need to dive into the manual to figure out what obscure lingo and icons mean.Live view works and works best for tripod work. It's rough going holding any SLR away from your face due to the weight. Manual focus with the enlarged view is a great idea.Overall, a fine camera with excellent kit lenses. If I had to nitpick I'd say the battery charger is absurdly slow and clunky. Come on Olympus, you can do better. Chargers should charge in less than 5 hours and plug directly into the wall. The Master 2 software is also pretty primitive. Then again, if you have a dSLR you probably have better software already. (If not, get Photoshop Elements, at the very least.)

This Olympus camera is a real improvement over my old Canon A70. I bought this model because of the in-body image stabilization and the good price for the two lens kit. The camera is very easy to handle and lightweight with either of the two short and lightweight lenses. It can fit in a small camera bag with the two lenses. The wide lens is wonderful for landscape and indoor shots. With some tweaking of the settings, the images are color-rich and sharp. I use P mode, vivid, sharpness -2, contrast -1 and noise reduction to off. The image stabilization system works great, and it is now possible to use it with legacy lenses. Indoor pictures without flash can easily be taken with the wide lens and IS on, but the subject needs to stand still in order to reduce movement blur. I have purchased a used 50mm F1.8 OM lens with an adapter, and now very dim light pictures are possible without flash using IS, just the TV on as the light source makes good pictures. The IS is also useful for telephoto pictures, there is no need to use a tripod. I also got a long telephoto of 500mm and I can get beautiful shots hand held.Now, the downsides. The Olympus digital lenses are quite expensive although of very good quality, but old lenses can be purchased with an adapter, as long as you can focus manually. High ISO pictures have more noise than competition, but I find the noise grain quite pleasing, so I don't mind. The viewfinder is dark and small compared to my old reflex camera, but the live view is excellent to make accurate focus. The last thing that annoys me is the fact that I can't quickly delete the picture right after the shot was made, I have to go to review mode then delete it.Overall, I am very satisfied with my camera.

Those, plus a lengthy and informative review by Andrzej Wrotniak (Google it) motivated me to purchase the E-510 with two lens kit from Amazon. Info from the reviews, a Quick Start DVD for this camera (that I think should be included in the retail box) and familiarity with my Olympus C-5060 have provided a quick learning experience. I have been getting excellent pictures from the first day.I decided to shoot in RAW only with my new DSLR. The results have been stunning. Olympus' RAW format seems to give a latitude of 3 (three) f stops or more and enables so many tweaks that even a grossly careless setting can often be fixed in post production. Of course it is always better to get everything correct in the camera. One way is to use automatic bracketing. Olympus requires that you activate this via the menu system. I would like to see it available on the Control Panel, but it's a small inconvenience.I use the camera for both pleasure and business. For business, I need to take pictures under conditions as they are presented, sometimes very contrasty, sometimes too little light, etc. By shooting RAW I am not just pleased, but astonished at the amount of information Olympus' sensor gathers and which can be brought out by manipulating the RAW file. The image stabilization works great and lets me generously fudge recommended shutter settings for a given focal length.These observations about the RAW files would apply to any current DSLR I suppose. But I have this one; so there. As a general note, If you have a camera that shoots RAW and you are not using it, then you are probably giving up on lots of shots that could be \"keepers\" had they been shot in RAW. Pros who used to shoot negative film knew that those negatives held a lot of image information that could be used if needed. Of course, extracting it required expert processing and cash. Today, pictures are all but free, memory is dirt cheap and if you can't use Photoshop, there are a number of freeware or shareware RAW converters, not to mention Olympus' own Master 2 software that does a decent job itself. Play around with RAW and you'll be amazed.I agree with others who are less than delighted with the Live View feature. It is not that it is poorly designed, just that the DSLR format and technology is not quite ready to allow a feature like this to really work as I would wish. If not in a hurry for a shot, then Live View is useable but a bit noisy. An articulated LCD display such as I have on my older C-5060 or which is available on the E-3 for almost triple the price would help a lot.In closing, the E-510 is a feature rich camera for the price, and the build quality, the feel of the camera and the results make it an excellent choice for an enthusiast.

One factor was that I have a few 'legacy lenses' from my traditional 35mm film camera that I wanted to be able to use. I have an old Konica lens that I can mod to fit, and can't wait to try it. They do also make several adapters so you can use the older lenses, in either manual or aperture priority (which I'd guess the former would be why many would turn to a DSLR instead of a higher end P&S; in the first place).I like the way the controls are set up (I had an older Olympus digital camera, and my last one was a Fuji Finepix s3100 which both were good at what they did - but I wanted more control over exposure). It did not take long to get used to the controls, maybe because I've had other cameras that were similar in set up, but it feels 'natural' to me now, and it didn't take long. There are many things you can adjust to your liking, and you really should read the manual to get the most out of the camera. I tried to dive in head first without reading it first, but there is so much that you can do with this camera, that you really should read it before you go testing it out, as it will make more sense and what you can do with it.I tweaked some of the settings (for noise and IS and such - you can even customize some minor things - wheel direction and some other things) and could not be happier with the results. After taking a couple of days to 'play around' with the settings, and to get a feel for it, I am perfectly content with this camera.I also think the feel in-hand is also very nice. It is neither too small (I've heard complaints of other Olympus models being too small for comfort) nor is it too heavy. The body size is maybe half an inch smaller than my 35mm, which is really not that much of a difference to me. The hand grip is also a good size, and the buttons you might need most often are within easy reach. I have medium-smallish hands, and it does not feel too big or awkward for me. I think with medium to large hands you could reach all of them (the AEL/AFL, IS and the live view) without looking/holding it differently.  The ones I need more often are all within easy reach. I think the hand grip is a size that would fit a larger range of hand size, as this one is a bit longer than the E-400 series that I've seen, so I think the change in size/grip may have been a result of feedback from earlier models that were reported to be too cramped.It is a great camera, and you can't even find 'live view' on comparable cameras, which I admit I haven't really used, but it comes in handy for low light focusing, and making sure you have your focus where you want it for critical images.It's got great options and the quality you get for the price can't be beat.", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Value in a DSLR Available Today", "Author": "Roadhunter \"Roadhunter\"", "ReviewID": "R14RFJNTVVLB82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera does all the description says and more.

By working with only one variable at a time, learning to shoot with manual settings is fun and easy.If you are uncertain about the 4/3rds format, be aware that this format is actually closer to standard print sizes, such as 8x10, than the standard format most digital cameras use.  You do not have to worry about having shots with odd looking aspect ratios.The kit lenses are more than adequate, with the 150mm being great for wildlife photography.  Using the image stabilization feature, telephoto shots of the moon in which craters are clearly visible can be taken without a tripod.Astrophotographers will like the option to leave the shutter open for 60 seconds, or up to 8 minutes with the optional remote control.I have no negatives to report for this camera.  I suggest purchasing a starter filter kit such as this Hoya 58mm Introductory Filter Kit, UV, Circular Polarizer, 81A and Filter Wallet, or at least a U/V filter for each lens if for no other purpose than to protect it.

The Olympus Evolt E-510 is actually my very first SLR of any kind. BUT! Like others have said, before I bought the E-510, I must of researched all the cameras in the price range for maybe 6-8 full months. So at this point, I feel like I'm an expert.Well...I fell into the dSLR market, perhaps like others, while I was one day watching a New York Giants football game on TV...when a Canon Rebel xti commercial came on. It was a beautiful commercial that started out saying, \"Why do we like football...?\" By the end of that commercial I was hooked. I wanted the Canon Rebel xti more than anything in the world, and I made that quite clear to my loved ones as well; as my birthday was steadily approaching.Anyway...I immediately went to 6th Avenue electronics to try to get one in my hands, but when I got there, the battery for the xti was out of juice, and they had no way of juicing it at all. (Which was a huge bummer...) Anyway, I talked to the sales guy and he showed me a number of dSLR's (the usual suspects) in that same price range. (The Nikon D40x, the Sony Alpha a100 or whatever it is, the Pentax K10 and K100, and the beautiful Olympus Evolt E-510, and maybe a couple others...)In any case... In the next couple of weeks, I went from store to store playing with every one for hours, and hearing the pros and cons of each from the sales people. After that, I stayed home and researched all day and all night on all the different cameras, at which time I was becoming more and more intrigued with the E-510.The sales people kept telling me that the in-camera image stabilization was so important because if I got another camera, I'd only be able to get it in some \u00fcber-expensive lenses. While on the other hand, my father, who was a high school photography teacher for years and years, told me in-camera IS wasn't that important unless I was to going to be shooting with a super-long telephoto lenses.IN ANY CASE.... After months and months of research and playing and trying out the different cameras, I decided I was finally just gonna close my eyes, bite my lip, and go for the Olympus E-510.And let me just say... It was absolutely the best decision I've made in a LOONG time...The E-510, in my opinion, is the most beautiful, remarkable camera in the under $1000 price range. Possibly even better than a few more expensive cameras... The E-510's pictures come out beautiful and crisp and can be adjusted in a myriad of ways. It has just soo many wonderful features, and each one is completely useful! It's not stuffed with a bunch of silly settings. It just simply comes with useful ones that are going to help you get the best picture possible.I really don't understand the people who have such huge problems with the camera. I honestly think they must have defective ones. It is just a simply remarkable camera. And don't be afraid of the settings! Some reviewers are saying, although this camera has the most, and most useful settings and features, the camera is not all that easy to use. I just simply do not find that true. When I first started learning about this camera, I didn't know what bracketing was, or what the different metering settings or white balance settings meant. But to be honest, the manual that came with the camera is quite good...It not only explains how to use each setting, but it also explains what each setting means. AND it has a bunch of photography tips in it too... It's pretty useful, especially for a beginner.The whole camera is great...The settings are in abundance, the picture quality is great (especially with a little tweaking), the feel of the camera is awesome (by the way..it's super light!), and the 2 kit lenses it comes with are SWEEEET!!! Also, the in-camera stabilization works awesome, apparently the dust removal system is proven to be the best on the market! PROVEN PEOPLE!!! That's awesome...Oh! And I have a great time shooting in low light. Once you get the hang of using this camera, you'll find you can do most anything with it. And do it well... Oh and, I had some trouble finding reviews and what-not of a few things I was interested in finding out like...how fast the camera is. And actually in this price-range of cameras, the continuous shooting mode is a tad faster than all the rest at like 3.09 per second, or something like that. But although I don't exactly know the exact numbers to all this...the continous shooting and shot-to-shot times of this camera is really, really great.Actually, I have a little niece and nephew, and it's quite difficult to get a 1 year old boy to sit there and smile into the camera... You have to follow the little guy around and shoot, and although almost ALL the pictures are in the focus because the built-in IS, it's still hard to get a GREAT shot of a 1 year old going crazy on a sugar high. So I just follow him around and snap, snap, snap the shutter button over-and-over-and-over again. Like I said, the shot-to-shot time is really great. And the buffer size must be pretty huge too because I was able to take a shot after shot after shot, whether shooting normally, or putting the camera in burst mode; the camera never slowed down for a second. You won't be dissapointed with that. In case you are knew to all this... The buffer is basically the place in which all your photos are kept before they are written to the memory card...So all-in-all, I really love this camera. Most everything about it. And just a personal tip...Read the real good reviews of the E-510 and read those reviewers pros and cons. I find they tend to be pretty accurate with the little cons there actually are with this camera.  And don't read the real bad reviews AT ALL... They are just plain and simply wrong... I don't know if those people all got defective cameras or what, but they are just wrong. I guess there are different tastes out there, but to just completely bash the E-510...it just is wrong...And just one more thing... I know there are A LOT of reviews out there by all kinds of reviewers. But I honestly believe you should trust me. Especially newcomers to d-SLR's who really don't know much of anything about these types of cameras... The other people have already formed different opinions about what they like and don't like, and they can just figure out which camera is right for them on there own. But for the others... I had wished when I was researching someone would just plain make the decision for me. 'cAuse I was just so overwhelmed with all the choices and different features... So here I go, just saying trust me. Let me decide for you... Choose this camera. Unless you get a defective one somehow..I truly believe you won't be dissapointed. And with all the settings, and what I think is easy to use, you will have a long while to have fun learning it all. And if you just plain get frusterated and just want to take a darn picture, well there are PLENTY of automatic settings for you. So again...Just trust me. You'll love this decision in the end. This is a superb dSLR in my opinion, abd I haven't even once since I've purchased it, thought to myself, maybe I should have gotten that other camera...Anyway...I'm actually Rob. For some reason Amazon wouldnt take my name and password. They kept giving me my mothers account even though they had a button that said, \" If this isn't Barbara, click here.\" It just wouldnt work. So just for your 411...I'm Rob, not Barbara.Good luck and good choosing everyone!!!  - RobHmmm...I can't think of anything to say", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absolutely awesome!", "Author": "R.

The price for this outfit shrunk from $1,000 to $620 in less than a year and a half.  With Olympus introducing the tweaked E-520, the 510 became old hat.  An example of excellent (but no longer state of the art) technology deeply discounted.As for the camera itself, these are its noteworthy attributes that might not be apparent at first study of the specs:A) On body (as opposed to on lens) image stabilization.  Take a look at lens prices for Nikon or Canon and compare to Olympus' Zuiko equivalents.  Nikon and Canon boast on lens stabilization - at a premium price.B) High reviews for the optical quality of these kit lenses - at virtually every aperture setting.  They're remarkably lightweight too.C) Four-Thirds sensor functionally doubles the 35mm equivalent zoom factor of the lenses.  Thus the 150mm kit lens magnifies to 300mm equivalent - about 8x zoom.D) Relatively lightweight but ergonomically friendly.E) Overall picture quality at various settings - really really good!Work Arounds:A) Noise reduction and sharpness default settings not so good.  I prefer the results with the noise filter on \"low\" and sharpness on \"minus one\".B) Speed: If freezing sport or fast action is important to you, look elsewhere.  ISO is best at 100 - 200.  Just fine through 400.  Beyond 400 to 800 is just OK - too much granularity for my liking.  Above 800 - forget it - noise is obvious.C) Only downside of the kit lenses are their maximum apertures of f3.5 and f4.0.  (Would really like a f2.8.)  However, pretty typical in this class.D) Built in flash is what you'd expect for this level camera - adequate at best.

Good image quality and metering. I lugged 35mm SLR's for decades and switched to point-&-shoots 15 years ago but finally succumbed to the removable lens/TTL viewing desire.  My chief complaint about this camera is that it is heavy -- not a heavy as most of its competitors, but still heavy.  Also the 14~42mm seems overly large, it is almost as big as the 40~150mm telephoto  Like all DSLR's, the e510 has huge number of control options you can fiddle with, and there is a learning curve to climb (and forget if you don't use the camera constantly).  However, the \"AUTO\" defaults work well in most situations, and it isn't too difficult to learn to set the defaults to your taste for apeture and shutter priority modes.The e-510's image stabilization does a fair job of compensating for your shaky hand, but even it couldn't stop the blur when trying to handhold the telephoto at it's maximum 150mm (300mm 35mm equivalent) range.  Plan on finding something solid to rest the camera against.  One note on Olympus' 4:3 aspect ratio sensor.  What it means is that for any given pixel count the Olympus gives you a few more vertical pixels but fewer horizontal ones than a 3:2 ratio sensor like most other DSLRs use.  Whether this is important depends on your composing preferences.  Since I end up cropping almost everything I print it makes little difference to me.

While they're all great cameras and I don't think that you'd make a wrong choice if you you got any of them, the Olympus seemed to offer a couple of things that I loved:- great image color & detail (although you as a photographer have to be a bit more precise than with the other cameras)- pretty straightforward button layout to access features and functions quickly- great dust reduction system- in-body image stablization- a comfortable size/weight in my hands- some truly great lensesThe only negative that I've got for the camera is that there aren't a bunch of low priced fast primes available at this time. While the lenses that are out there are really good, they're on average a bit more expensive than those of the competition.For the price, the two lens system blows away the competition.

Having owned a Nikon 35mm SLR and shooting with it for the past 2 years I naturally wanted to get the Nikon D80 but the price of the E-510 with 2 lenses was simply irresistable. And boy am I glad I decided to go with it!Autofocus is fast and accurate. For zoomed-in macros however it might miss dead center every now and then depending on the lighting. This might be normal though and since, as mentioned, this is my first DSLR I have nothing to compare autofocus accuracy against. It features an automatic + manual fine tune focus setting so even this is not really a problem. Battery life is decent. The longest I've used it so far is a little over half a day with about 150 shots and I still had power to spare even with the flashing firing for fill every now and then. I read a lot of reviews before I bought mine and figured with this kind of picture quality I best buy extras. I'm all the better for it, carrying 2 extra batteries when I take it out.Ergonomics were well thought of when Oly designed this camera. The shortcut buttons for the major functions are an excellent touch, the rubbery material used on the grip feels just right and navigation couldn't be easier. Oly's menu system allows you to get to whatever setting you need very easily and the LCD screen is bright. Kudos to Oly right there!Image stabilization? It works! Tried taking zoom macro shots with and without it and the difference is clearly visible.Live view? I'm sure it's an excellent feature for others but it's not really for me. Adds quite a bit of delay when taking a photo and runs your batteries down quicker. If you choose to go its way, again I suggest an extra battery or two. My first impression with it is it's better performed with a tripod. It does work quite well and of course, it's there when you absolutely need it.And the lenses? They're kit lenses and on the bottom of Oly's range so most people might make the mistake of shrugging them off. Beginners, amateurs and advanced amatures like the most us could of course forgive the pros for frowning on them. Starter lenses they are, true, but for amateur and advanced amateur shooting the image quality is excellent. I've been taking pictures with the lenses zoomed in on everything from flowers to dragonflies and they've come up pristine. The resized image of the dragonfly I'm uploading don't do the original justice but you can still see the fine details on the wings. Now if the starter lenses can come up with pictures this gorgeous imagine what the 50-200mm Zuiko ED Lens can do!? A word of caution on the starter lenses though - they're not weather sealed.Without a doubt this camera is a great buy. Get more advanced lenses and you'll be even happier (something I'll be doing very soon). On a side note, mine came with a free Lowepro Transporter Camera Strap (thanks Amazon!) which made an already excellent purchase an even better value. It's comfy and well built with quality from end to end, an accessory that you might wanna look into. If you plan to shoot RAW I suggest you get storage with no less than a 4GB of space. With a camera this fine you'll be shooting a lot (so don't forget your extra batteries). Got me a Kingston CF/4GB-S 4 GB ElitePro CompactFlash Card and it works well with the camera. Nothing to complain about read/write speed there. The Transporter strap has a removable pouch with space for 2 more memory cards in case you need to carry extras.Thanks for reading my humble review and Happy Shooting!", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!", "Author": "C.

I bought the camera to upgrade my ability to capture indoor architectural details in historic buildings. My background includes the use of 35mm film SLRs and digital point & shoot cameras. I have been slow on getting a DSLR because I don't like big, heavy cameras in outsized bags. The E-510 is amazingly light but easy to get a good grip on. I've added a Lowepro 160 AW bag for the camera, two lenses, a spare Olympus Li-ion battery and a spare 4GB compactFlash card. There's still room for more and it is almost feather light over your shoulder.I have taken several hundred practice images in my own home using the built-in flash and an external Olympus FL-36 electronic flash with tripod. As expected, the built-in flash is fine for quick photos of the family but more serious work demands an external flash unit. I've added a diffuser to my FL-36 and found it helpful. I've used automatic settings and tried the full range of manual settings. So far I've only used the lower resolution SQ JPEG settings. For minute detail I plan to use higher resolution HQ, SHQ and RAW settings in the future. These settings are all easy to find and quick to set using the camera's easy to read paper instruction manual and intuitive Menu viewable through the LCD window on the back of the camera.Outdoors I've made very good use of both lenses and the image stabilization feature. When you can walk backwards in a busy zoo and can capture a two year old without blurring, you've got a great stabilization system on the camera! I've taken several hundred images of waterfalls in a dark forrest with brilliant, high-noon sun streaming through the trees and close range to distant landscape shots around a large manmade lake from a fast moving boat. All the results have been excellent. I have taken a number of these images, opened them up in Adobe Photoshop CS2 and been very pleased with the results.I have tried the \"live view\" capability and it works fine but I find myself using the viewfinder 95% of the time. So, this feature is pretty cool but up to you on how you prefer to use it. Battery life is outstanding. In other words battery life has been a complete non-issue to me, inside, outside, with or without the flash.Concerning low-light focus problems mentioned in some other reviews. I have experienced the problem, but with all the settings this camera has, you can easily work around the issue. But it is important to know this limitation and experiment with it before you encounter it in a photo shoot situation.If you'd like some outstanding recommendations on how to customize and save your E-510 camera settings check out this website. [...]One thing I have not tried yet is the panoramic shooting mode. To use this mode you must have a Panoramic xD card (I bought two CompactFlash cards, 2GB & 4GB when I bought the camera). The xD card will be my next purchase. Unless you want to spend the money, you might buy the 4GB CompactFlash card and a 1GB or 2GB xD card for starters. No, the camera does not come with a memory card upon initial purchase unless you buy a complete kit.So, read the reviews, to include the 4 and 3 star reviews. If you make your decision to buy a E-510 and save a few bucks or buy the newest E-520 you won't be disappointed.

It really is a joy to use I feel that I will be encouraged to take more pics because of the ease of use and quality feel.

Unless I am not doing something right! when using live view the camera does not pre-focus before taking the picture - Instead when I aim the camera at my subject and press the shutter half way (which would be the way to focus normally) the camera does nothing, instead you have to press the shutter all the way down - then it focuses and also takes the picture in one feld swoop! Now this has been my experience so far at least with close subjects, say 12 feet or less, and when in the macro mode for example you have no idea if your image will be focused or not until AFTER the trigger has been pulled. If I am doing something wrong please let me know - but the way I read the manual this is the way it works. I personally like to know if my image is in focus first, before taking a picture. Of course if you do not use the live view function and use the viewfinder instead all is swell. so I am not very confident when using the live view mode, which is the only reason I did not rate this camera 5 stars.

But I have also crossed referenced pricing on some of the other lenses - and find minimal differences in pricing - for example I am very interested in the Olympus 11-22mm zoom and you can buy this for right at $600.00 - Nikon, Cannon, and Sigma all have almost the same price for appx. the same lens - and I find that to be the case on most of the other lenses when comparing apples to apples, with one exception and that would be the 1.4x converter - the olympus is definitly higher than any of the other brands. someone had mentioned prime lenses in an earlier comment and olympus does make the 35mm and Sigma makes a 24mm for olympus which should be perfect for a good prime considering that would double to 48mm on this camera.

They even credited my account when the price dropped $11 a week after I ordered the camera.  As far as the camera goes...nothing but WOW!  I am new to the DSLR world, but am quickly learning how much more capability is available at my finger tips with this camera.  I spent an average amount of time researching DSLRs before buying this one.  At first, I was going with the Canon Digital Rebel XTI without question.  Then I started looking at the Nikons and finally got to the Olympus.  As far as picture quality and standard features go, all three brands were comparable, it's not until you get to the details of what each can provide/offer where the differences start showing up.  The factors that won me over were the image stabilization, LCD Live-vew capture preview, and the camera/lens kit quality/value.  I was impressed with the reviews for the quality of the kit lens' vs the other competitors.  Now after shooting a few hundred photos and playing with different settings, this camera can deliver great shots that I could never get before.  With some adjustments, I took some very good low light stills of Christmas lights/scenes.  I can't wait to use this camera on my upcoming trip to Yosemite.

It's just what I needed to take my photography skills to the next level. The kit lenses are surprisingly good and light which are traits that don't often go together in lenses. It's quick compared to even the nicest P&S; cameras (I had a Canon S3 IS before this). IS in the body is a nice feature so I don't have to buy more expensive lenses to get that feature. The jpeg white balance seems a little off (too much white by default) so I just shoot in RAW which gets around that problem. You can also adjust the white balance but I just decided I'd rather do it in post. Picasa does a good job with the RAW files so I don't have to use the Olympus software which seems kind of klunky to me. I may get Lightroom at some point when my finances have recovered to get a little more in-depth with post processing.The live view feature sounded good on paper but really isn't that useful in practice. I might as well just take a photo and see how that looks instead of previewing with live view. If it's no good I can just delete it.The only really annoying thing about this camera is Olympus' proprietary USB connector. Why do they have to do that?!?! It takes what might have been a five star product down to four. There is no good reason to take a standard like a mini USB connection and change it to make your customers have to buy your special cables. But even with this gripe it was worth it.Auto focus in low light is not that great (slow) and it uses the flash to get a focus lock which can be distracting to your subjects and kind of kills the mood you often create in a low light situation. In sunlight the focus is quick and accurate.I also got an Olympus Macro Extension Tube which is nice if you like to take some macro shots but don't want to spend the money on a whole separate lens. The tube with the 40-150 lens takes some nice macro shots (manual focus only) without breaking the bank.Other recommended accessories would be a Zing neoprene pouch (Standard SLR size will fit with either lens) and some UV Protective filters to keep the optics clean and safe.Overall it's highly recommended if you're looking to break into the world of DSLR photography without having to take out a second mortgage.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best choice for the price", "Author": "I.

If you have never had an SLR camera, you might want to start with a simpler point and shoot type. If you're on your way to being a pro, this is a good camera to help you get there.

No issues with the camera although I did go for the 3-year Olympus warranty and had the kit serviced 3 times for general cleaning/check-up.

So far this E510 has survived three different countries - Micronesia, Kuwait and Afghanistan.  I like this camera but it is not perfect.

The predialed modes are not very good outside in direct sunlight.The dust reduction system I don't really understand.  Only after a few months there was dust inside the lens and the body it's self.  I don't see how it cleans its self.  The camera feels good in the hand and is smaller than a lot of DSLRs - I like that.  The flash system is a bit slow, though.  I don't like that.Over all this camera is a good beginner camera to learn from with the intent of jumping into semi-pro, pro DSLR models.  I jumpled from my Canon S3 IS to this...I didn't like this DSLR over the Canon S3 IS - I will never buy Olympus again, though, simply because of the overexposure problems of light areas within every photo unless you play with settings here and there to compensate.

In fact, I resisted making the digital switch until just 18 months ago.  The E-330 was my first Digital SLR and it gave me pixel-fever... more megapixels please!The E-510 does it all.  It provides a fully automatic that anyone can use or, extreme manual control for the pro.  Coupled with OLY digital lenses, I gave an exhaustive test using the kit lenses for macro photography to scenics that just blows me away.Making the switch from the OM to the E-series was surprisingly painless.  Even though there is much more capability and options, they make sense and are convenient.  Many times I don't have to look at the body, fingers just know where to go for a feature/option.Once I started buying better lenses, it continued to provide amazing results.  Above all others I highly recommend the Zuiko Digital ED 50-200mm F2.8 SWD.  The other I use extensively is the Zuiko Digital ED 14-54mm F2.8  Come on Nikon and Canon users, I welcome a shootout any day.Next was the coupled flashes... even though there is an incredible amount of flexibility and control with the \"built-in\" flash I still went with the FL-50 unit and I depend on it for weddings.  Great range, consistently good exposures, even more flexibility and control.A brief departure to the E-520.  Bought it.  Returned it.  Sorry Olympus, you blew it big time.  The E-510 consistently shoots better and you can depend on the image being there.  Not so for the next generation.I'll never give up my E-510 until it dies... maybe I'd better buy one and keep it stored.  The E-620 is my next purchase.

I did not set out intending to remain brand-loyal, and researched all the Nikon, Canon, and Pentax models of the same class before concluding that the e-510 was the best choice for me.So far I have no major complaints, and can echo all of the many positives already covered in other reviews.  I take mainly close nature shots, landscapes, and some people.  After spending a couple days of spare time reading the manual cover-to-cover, and fiddling with the settings and options, was able to quickly hone my skills with a series of test shoots, and now feel like I can get the camera to do whatever I need it to do with ease, and with every-day quality exceeding my best 35mm results.  Previously mentioned complaints about over/under exposure, diminished dynamic range, and highlight clipping are easily avoided with proper attention to settings.  I will shoot mainly in aperture-priority or shutter-priority mode, using manual focus through the viewfinder, and would echo other reviewers in saying that you have to be willing to control the camera's features yourself to get the results desired, and not just rely on the automated settings.  So far the ability to preview  exposure results in the viewfinder, and to lock exposure settings at any point during composition before final framing, have been especially helpful during the learning phase (as no doubt they would be with any of the competition).My one disappointment so far may have resulted from poor research and unwarranted assumptions on my part.  My favorite feature of the OM-4T was its spot-metering system, with the ability to store and average up to 7 spots of my choice for each exposure.  I metered virtually all my shots this way, with consistently pleasing results.  So I just assumed that the \"spot metering\" capability of the e-510 would be equivalent.Maybe I am still missing something, but so far it appears that the e-510 can spot-meter based only on a single \"spot\" per exposure.  And one has to find and set the AEL/AFL Memo setting to Yes to be able to \"lock in\" this spot without continually holding down a separate button while releasing the shutter.  So the upshot is that I have to choose my one spot more carefully than before to get the desired exposure - not too huge an an adjustment.UPDATE July 2013: Still going strong after 7000+ shots.  Kit lens getting slightly loose and sometimes \"slips\" during manual focus, but still usable enough.  Having to re-map pixels about every 3 months of use to keep them \"clean.\"  All other features still working great, in-body image stabilization is all the tripod I need.

Well designed, both technically and ergonomically. Surprizingly long lasting baterry life due to effective power management, exceptional lenses.  Very light but well done construction.

The exposure info (in view finder) is also located on the periferal right side (instead of the better accesible bottom side like on a Canon).  One has to squint and look for it.  According to Olympus, there are no means of increasing the green LED light intensity in the view finder display? This would have been so easy to design in? Flash is not powerful enough for more than a few feet close ups.  External general purpose flash (non Olympus) sync is only up to 1/160 of a second.  A higher number would be desirable to shoot with fill in flash, humming birds in flight (at >1/1000 sec), for instance.  Found four burned out pixels on the first shots.  I called Olympus, and problem was resolved by performing \"pixel mapping\" a built in firmware process that borrows information from nearby live pixels and blends it into the non functional pixels. The pixels remain non functional, however.

Well, I got what I wanted! I bought it used and it seemed in perfect condition.I do everything on manual because I love control, and I haven't used any of its automatic settings, so my review is based on the manual performance of the camera. The picture quality is fine, and seems to take sharp pictures if you have it focused just right. The live view LCD screen is a god-sent, I have no idea why everyone hates it; I'm always using it! You can see how bright or dark your picture will turn out (but it won't show it exactly if it's too dark or too bright etc), where your focus is (you can zoom in 10 times to see if you focused correctly, which is awesome), and you don't have to look through that tiny viewfinder. Screw viewfinders, LCD screen all the way. I have almost nothing to complain about liveview, except it has a lot of trouble trying to display the focus when it's dark. In fact, I find it impossible to manually focus during the night, and I have to rely on auto focus ... which isn't that great in low light situations.Anyways, the camera works and I got what I wanted. There is one thing that bugs the hell out of me though; hot pixels, or 'stuck pixels'. If you leave the camera on for too long, or you are taking long exposure shots, you WILL get random pixels on your pictures that stand out like a sore thumb. The longer the exposure, the more pixels you get. I mainly use my camera for studio shots, which means I have the camera on for like at least 2 hours. Eventually random pixels that are pure white or yellow will show up in the final picture. I figured it wasn't that bad, it just means I can't leave my camera on for too long. Unfortunately, they have also shown up at random when the camera was JUST turned on after being off for a week. Seeing as I see no one else with this problem, I'm assuming it's because I've used the camera a lot and it's aging, or I just happened to have gotten a bad camera. Even so, it's an issue future E-510 owners should know; hot pixels are a problem with this camera.The camera is actually really bad in low light settings. It can't focus worth a damn when it's dark, so don't even try. Which means you have to do it manually, which isn't that great either on the live-view, so try the viewfinder instead. Flash sucks, as with all DSLR on-board flash, but I find that the ISO really isn't that bad. Just turn on the noise-reduction in-camera and put the ISO up to 800. You can see some noise at 800, but at least you can take in-door shots for your family without using flash. At night 800 is fine too. At 400 ISO you can't really tell if there is any noise, but you might sometimes see it in the shadows. 1600 should be done for snapshots, as it will get grainy and noisy. Either way, I'd rather use ISO than the flash.While it seems I think this is a bad camera, I am only mentioning its shortcomings and faults. It's a good camera for me to use, however I could have done without the hot pixels problem. The camera is good for me, because it's compact, small, light to carry around, has live view, two lenses, a sensor dust cleaner and the picture quality is just fine. There's also image stabilization in camera, but I haven't seen it make a difference ... at all.If you think you'll do a lot of night shots, don't buy this camera. If you're going to use auto focus all the time, don't buy this camera. If you're really afraid of those random pixels appearing on your images, don't buy this camera (although they're not that hard to edit out). However, if you are looking for something that works great manually, has a live-view screen and the picture quality is good, go ahead and buy this one!I give this camera a 3.5/5 stars.

It was a determining factor in the purchase for me.I am not a professional photographer but I do insist on professional looking photos.  The main reason for this camera as oposed to others was it is one of the only possibly THE only DSLR that allows you to use the screen to take photos instead of looking through the eyepiece.  I generally use the eyepiece because I do prefer using the eyepiece however there is sometimes when it is convenient to use.For the most part, I use this camera on AUTO.  Like I said, I'm not pro.  However I have two issues that crop up on this setting and the reason the product only got a 4-star was the White Balance on AUTO setting in bright outside situations is terrible!  The photos always way to bright almost to the point of being washed out.  It can be compensated in a Post editor but it is a pain and an extra step.  The WB can be easily adjusted with the simple touch of a button even in AUTO mode but it is very hard for my untrained eye to know when and how much to adjust it.  I have been toying with \"bright outside days\" WB=-1.0 usually works well however and destroy the photo if you leave it there and go inside and take some photos.The second issue is sometimes the focus time is extremely long.  Sometimes it will just not focus.  It tries and then gives up.  Usually a slight shift to whatever you are focusing on will allow it to refocus.  Also sometimes it focus' on the left or the right side of the frame which is really annoying.  When I point the camera at something, I generally put whatever I am focusing on in the middle of the frame.  This also can be set C-AF in the AF menu but if you shut the camera off, it will switch back to S-AF when you turn it back on.Generally speaking, I love this camera.  I would buy it again, it takes excellent photos.

I just saw newer E-520 for less than the price I see listed on this item (subject to change over time, of course). I'll continue with a comment or two on this model in case you have a chance to get a steal of a price on a used one.I've had my E-510 for almost three years now and have loved using it and learning about photography with it. I've gotten some spectacular shots with it. Blah blah, I'm sure you can find detailed specs and glowing praise in other reviews. I just want to comment on the two things that irritate me about this camera.First, the higher ISO settings are pretty much unusable due to the ridiculous amount of noise and banding you'll see in areas that aren't extremely well lit. Olympus DSLRs are notorious for this problem. I'd love to see them make a breakthrough in their sensors before I upgrade cameras because I've invested in this system. But if they don't do something drastic to increase the usability of the higher ISO settings, I'm going to abandon them for Nikon.Second, the exposure bracketing makes HDR photography painful to attempt. You can only take three bracketed exposures in a row and then only 1 EV apart from each other. I found out about HDR technique a only few months after buying this camera and then began regretting having chosen this one. Live and learn.Otherwise, if you aren't bothered by those two shortcomings, and you aren't planning to be a pro shooter, you will probably LOVE this little DSLR.

WB Never Gets Right... Dark Pictures... Dull Colors", "Author": "wildcatgoal", "ReviewID": "RHF4X047DOLCM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A lot of people seem to like this camera.  Why?  I bought this from Amazon.com (great service), took somewhere around 250-300 pictures at all qualities, settings, scenes, lighting, color pallets, etc., using the kit lenses trying to get things to look like I see them with my eyes or better and it just never happened no matter what I did with the settings.  Listen, I'm not a pro but, get this, I took it to a product photographer at work and my neighbor who's a big Canon buff and using their advice, I still couldn't get it to brighten up!  Still, the camera's AUTO mode should take, say, B+/A- grade pictures in the \"average\" situation but this sucker does not.  Why?!  In fact, no Olympus camera I've had has!  Weird.The menu makes sense, but it's just so \"filled\" with options that already have their own button on the camera itself, mixed in with unique settings, that it get's tiresome to flip through.  Speaking of flipping through, the buttons on the menu control worry me.  I've used cameras where the buttons feel like they're right out of the interior of a BMW - tight, quiet, heavy feeling - but these buttons feel like they're right out of a Ford Fiesta (okay, maybe Daewoo).  They are light, overly \"clicky,\" and I feel like they'll pop off someday.Same goes for the rest of the camera, including the kit lenses.  Now, this thing is light and that is nice.  But camera feels, again, like a Ford Fiesta in terms of build quality vs. other cameras.  It feels hollow to me, as if there's a lot of room in there for \"improvement.\"  No, there are no echos.  We all know what cheap feels like vs. well-built!  The kit lenses don't scope out and in as smoothly as I feel like they should.  Sometimes they snag just a teeny, tiny bit and coupled with the fact that they are just not smooth operating makes me wonder how long they'll last.The white balance (WB) adjustments on this camera work just like any other SLR I'm sure but, my gosh, all it does is make dull, dark photos go straight to washed-out and super-mega bright!  This isn't a defect model.  I went to Ritz thinking it was and played with their display; same thing.  I could NOT get this camera to take a picture with the right WB so that the image was crisp, clear, properly lit, and all that.  No matter the ISO, contrast setting, sharpness setting, noise filter setting, etc.  At Ritz, we put on a fancier lense for the heck of it, and though things improved (not enough at all though), because the screen is not high-res enough, you couldn't tell if the detail got better other than noticing - due to the expanded ability of a higher apeture lense - that the brightness got more accurate.Plus sides of this camera are:> Image stabilization built in in two modes (horizontal + vertical for most shots and just horizontal for panning)> 10MP> Screen size> Grip and size of unit is perfect (Rebel XT/XTi is horrible)> Light (but in a bad way to me)> Takes pictures fast> Auto focus is accurate and fast (only 3-focus points though)> And other stuff, but this is a negative review....You can obviously tell I was just not impressed with this camera!  For $600+ it's just doesn't cut it relative to what it SHOULD be.  I took 10 shots with the Nikon D80 and almost bought it right then and there!  I would have IF it had image stabilization built in and - though I don't believe this does much more than setting the camera down hard - dust removal technology.  I still might but I'm going to explore the Nikon D80, Canon EOS 20D/30D/40D, and the Pentax K10D.  The Rebel XT/XTi is out of the question because the grip isn't bulky enough for my taste.I bought this camera because I was attracted to the dual lenses and the big feature list.  But, once again, I realized that if you ask for everything, everything presents itself, and you know you aren't paying enough for it, then what you are buying is 2/3rds of what everything could be had you paid what you should have paid for it.

I've taken over a thousand pics with this thing and the battery lasted a ridiculous long time. I bought the camera with the two lens kit. As bad as the live view seems to some people I loved it when I was taking pictures for a friend's wedding. Yes, it wasn't moving action, but when you are taking a still photo and you want that awkward angle then it is perfect. The lag is about 1 second or so, about what you would expect from a point and shoot. I am inexperienced with SLRs but I have been around a few between my coworkers having a Rebel XTi and a D50. I must say I've handled the XTi a few times and it feels good and shoots great but I'm in love with my purchase. The ability for my mother to use the live view to get pictures of me and my wife with our two year old's first xmas with her family together (I was in iraq for her first) was amazing. The pictures turned out great and she didn't have to bother with the viewfinder. I do have one SMALL problem with it. My point and shoot doesn't have a problem whatsoever with low light pics, if it can't see it, it focuses as best it can and takes the pic anyways. With the E-510 it will not stop trying to focus for 3 sets of strobing flashes unless it does focus and will not take a picture until it does. I guess its ok when you don't want blur, but sometimes just getting the quick photo is a lot better than missing the opportunity altogether. Also, this camera is perfect in size for those transitioning to D-SLRs. I find myself picking up the XTi thinking, \"Wow, this thing is huge!\" Even though it's a small SLR, lol...All in all I think I made a very wise purchase. It had every feature I wanted and yes, live view was one of them. I paid 650 for it at the first of december, and didn't regret waiting for another price change one bit even though it dropped around the holidays to 600.If you are thinking about it and can't decide between cameras, you can't beat this one.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "it is the cheapist DSLR, but you have to know why", "Author": "david wu \"dchen1968\"", "ReviewID": "R2AFHVQCEYNCZ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is good camera,especially in this low price ($549 with two lens in fry's). I don't want to mention good points because a lot of people already did. I just want to point out big problem for this camera because it looks like nobody mentioned yet. The big problem is auto focus in very low light( I mean very low light),the camera has no response or lens zoom in and out, just refuse to fire. I tried many times. Probablly the reason is that camera couldn't see any subject although alluminating assist light kept flashing. I tried it in day time, too. I just point camera to sky(blue sky without clouds), the camera had same problem ( could not focus and refuse to fire). In above satuations I had to change to MF or turn on release prority, but picture came out with out of focus. This is very annoying and never happend to other camera,even very cheap point and shot camera. I could not figure out why, probably this camera only has 3 point auto focus compare with canon has 9 points. olympus e500 has the same problem. I heard olympus e3 has 11 points auto focus. I don't know if it has the same problem. If you want to buy this camera, you have to know this problem. If you can tolerate this, you can buy it. it is the cheapist DSLR with high qulity in the market.", "Date": "December 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disapointed", "Author": "BrianS", "ReviewID": "RCZV0Z53L15YM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had great expectations for Olympus E-510.  After learning on a Canon A620, I wanted something that would give me consistently better pictures.  Unfortunately, the E-510 is not that camera.  I am plagued with out of focus, under and over exposed junk shots.  Out of 500 shots, four were keepers.  I have tried shooting in all modes, indoors and out,  with bad results.  For a time, I might have had trouble getting consistent lens contact, which would explain some of the poor focus problem.  Eventually, auto focus could be obtained in still controlled indoor shots, but not outside (for me, the viewfinder is inadequate for manual focus).  Also, Image Stability seems to offer little help in cutting down blur.  The camera feels great to hold, and has all the bells and whistles, but what's the use if you can't get clear pictures.  Final thought: It has been discussed at length, the need to turn off noise reduction on the E-510, in order to get clear pictures ( usually have it off).  For some shots this is helpful, but for most it will introduce an abundance of noise into your pictures.  In many cases, I can get better results from my point-n-shoot (in manual mode) than I can in any selection with the E-510.  I don't have any other cameras to compare with, so similar models of other brands may not be better.  I do know that $900 is a lot to pay for a failed photographic experiment.Follow up after 1 month, about 2000 shots:  Hopefully, this is my final word on the e510.  After being accused of naivet\u00e9 by more learned photographers, I was frustrated about how to warn against the limitations of this camera.  After rereading many of the e510 online reviews, at various photo sites, I noticed some of them warn against the limitations of the sensor.  They state that it operates at the far limits of what a sensor its size can handle.  This is the only thing that makes sense to me, when trying to make a rational evaluation.  Perhaps my frustration is that my old P&S; (Canon A620) had a very high quality sensor, for that kind of camera, and that I expected the E510 to surpass it, which it hasn't, except in a few limited cases. I like to visit my local park and shoot geese and ducks, mostly.  My old A620 would give me dazzlingly sharp pictures of wing tip feather details.  However, I needed a tripod, perfect light, a range within 50ft.  The E510, according to the reviews, promised to overcome those limits.  The samples provided by some reviews looked very good.  So I expected the E510 would easily meet my expectations. My first disappointment with the E510 was that the IS in Auto mode would not give good pool-party style pictures - even a P&S; without IS can do this.  My next disappointment was that it would not take controlled indoor still photos well, even on a tripod, even in Manual mode - they were blurry.  I suspect that the lens was making poor electrical contact with the body, since Oly warns about this in their FAQ, and because the pictures improved later. My real disappoint was at the park shooting ducks and geese.  I had high hopes that IS would let me take hand held shots, but no.  I took 150 hand held shots alternating between kit lenses without a keeper.  The next day, I tried again with both noise liters turned off, but the results were about the same (noise being a minor issue in these kinds of shots).  So I brought my tripod to the park, but still, in daylight, with sitting ducks, using every settable range available on the camera, only 2 of 170 shots were keepers.  This was no better than my A620 P&S;! I don't hate the E510, I'm just disappointed.  I paid $700 more than I did for my P&S; for pictures of comparable quality.  I love the way the E510 feels - it makes you want to go shooting.  I love the lenses, especially the 40-150mm.  I will definitely keep working to find the sweet spot in this camera.  However, the LiveView is useless if you are trying to capture a moment, since it has a one second shutter delay.  The viewfinder is too small and dim to accurately use manual focus in most cases.  Also, the viewfinder display isn't bright enough in daylight to see easily, unless you give your eye time to adjust.  The passive AF (common to DSLRs) on the E510 is easily confused, especially in dim light.  When AF uses the flash to set range, it delays the shot by seconds, and ruins a candid shot.  Comparing shots with my friend's xti, I end up with large dark patches, that the xti doesn't get.  There are adjustments that can correct some of this, but you loose in other areas to do it - the xti does not.  This, according to the reviews, may be due to a sharp luminance drop off, compared to the xti, and the D40x. I bow to those photo masters who, not so graciously, commented on my review.  I still have a lot to learn.  However, there are limitations to this camera that are being ignored.  If this were a $500 or $600 camera, I would say hurray; the picture quality isn't any better than my $200 P&S;, but it has lots of bells and whistles, and it feels great to work with.  You can't move into DSLR much cheaper, so suffer the disappointment with me (all entry level DSLRs have their draw backs), or put out the really big bucks, I guess.  I see the Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II is selling for about $7000 (body only).", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "It is upto my expectations, but settings is not that easy", "Author": "Joseph A.
