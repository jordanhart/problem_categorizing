{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A high-quality product that is genuinely easy to use!", "Author": "Amber Karlin", "ReviewID": "R1J7NSTEPLW6TM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having taught all my 40-year-old-plus family members how to use their own digital cameras, I was hoping someday to get a camera that required no explanation or tech support right out of the box.  I had dealt with poorly-laid-out button interfaces and illogical menu structures, so I was prepared for the worst but hoping for the best.  When I got this camera for Christmas, I was pleasantly surprised by how logical and simple everything was.  To review your pictures, you hit the button labeled \"review\".  To change the flash settings, you hit the lightning bolt button and it cycles through the options.  The icons are easy to understand, instead of a confusing set of hand shapes and stick figures.Besides the camera itself, I was very pleased with the Kodak EasyShare software that came with.  I usually avoid installing any software bundled with a product, especially if it's meant to be \"idiot proof\", since that's usually the software that weasels its way into every folder and registry section on your computer.  But in the case of the EasyShare software, it's definitely a worthwhile installation.  It easily transfers pictures from your camera to your computer, facilitates point-and-click captioning, and instantly uploads your pictures to your online gallery (after you've created a free account, of course).  The gallery is a great bonus; it's like flicker or any other online album site, but the Kodak gallery links with your software so you can constantly update it with one click of a button.  As a bonus, you also get 20 free 4x6 prints when you create a gallery account (at least, as of the date of this review).Alright, back to the camera.  The quality of the pictures seems very high, though I don't know if 8.2 megapixels really performs that much better than 4-5 megapixels.  I don't have any side-by-side shots of these pictures versus lower-quality ones, but the price is right on this camera anyway, so you may as well go for all the megapixels you can stomach.  The internal memory doesn't have much room for pictures taken at 8.2mp, but thankfully you can change the camera's settings and lower the quality of your pictures (not too noticeably, either) to have enough room for 40+ pictures.  Ideally, of course, you'll have a memory card (like this one: Kingston 2GB Secure Digital Memory Card (SD/2GB, Retail Package); my 2gb card can fit over 1700 pictures at the highest quality on the camera.  I haven't taken any video with the camera yet, but the process seems easy enough.All in all, this is the perfect camera for someone who may not be technologically savvy but also wants a nice product.  Also, I see no problem for those of us who actually know what they're doing, but don't want a hassle.  The camera is great, the software is great, and I'm quite pleased with the whole package.  I highly recommend it!", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "kodak  8.2 mp digital camera", "Author": "William Blake Sr. \"william blake\"", "ReviewID": "R37NV3B7NJSYU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought kodak easyshare 8.2 mp digital camera i found it to be a great camera the photos are amazing the camera picks up on every detail would highly recomend to anyone looking for a good camera and the price cannot beat it as always kodak lives up to there name for quality  with kodak you cannot go wrong hope this review is helpful", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Don't embarras yourself buying this camera", "Author": "Gary A. sCHULTZ", "ReviewID": "R91RRVOGB5OS4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera for my in-laws.

Over the years I have purchased numerous Kodak cameras and have been very pleased with them all. Until this holiday season. I decided to splurge a bit and get myself two new cameras, one to fit into my pocket and another with a large zoom for my photography hobby. I purchased the m853 and the ZD710. Both were on sale on black friday. I was horribly dissapointed in both. The m853 produced \"ok\" pictures, and the ZD710 was worse than my older z740. I took them both back and chose the v803 and z712. Both set me back even more $$, but it was completely worth it. The quality is fabulous! My advice: steer clear of cameras that are \"special\" buys. If you want a camera that will leave you satisfied, be prepared to shell out a little bit extra dough. In the end it will be worth every dollar.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wish I could return my Camera!", "Author": "Tammy Tatro", "ReviewID": "R1LTCUZAVMQVVZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Had a Kodak for years that I loved so I decided to upgrade to the M853 for more mega pixels and because it looked cool. What a mistake! The lens is SLOW! Half of my pictures are blurry which is really annoying because I was taking pictures of a wedding and others of my young niece and most looked terrible when I got them to my computer. The blur feature is only somewhat reliable as many pictures that are blurry still have a green hand which is supposed to mean they are clear.I read mixed reviews about this camera before I bought it but decided that since my old Kodak was great that this one was sure to be great too. It is not. I really wish that I had returned this camera and now it is to late.I am going on a trip soon and have decided that I will be using my old camera instead of this new one.

It is a nice looking camera. The controls are great and very easy to use. It even has a great feature that stiches 3 photos together to create panoramic shots but the camera takes grainy pictures. I think I has a cheap lens or light capturing cell. It's specially bad in low light scenes such as night or inhouse scenes. I am truly disapointed. My 1.5 megapixel camera I bought 7 years ago takes way better pictures at 1020 X 960 than this camera at over 3000 X 2000 resolutions. Perhaps this was designed as an entry level device for kids. However I would expect to pay more along the lines of 60.00 to 70.00 bucks. I thought a 8.2 megapixel camera would be a step up to my 1.5 megapixel serial port slow camera but I was wrong. I am going to return this one. I bought this one at staples for 149.00 with a free 1 meg memory card.

The only issue I can add is I thought it would have more internal memory.  Being a novice I did not know how little the internal memory really would hold.

I originally bought this camera thinking the higher the megapixel the better, but i was wrong this camera shoots very grainy pictures. you notice that when you start to zoom in and it doesn't capture details very well as most if not all the picture details in the background are blurry when you zoom in  and look closely . I have to say i was disappointed with this camera cause my old minolta digcam had only 4megapixels and even that came out better photos than this one.But on the bright side this camera is very easy to use and feature are basic and if you don't care about really good detailed quality in a photo and just want something semi decent then this is a good buy , but otherwise if you want a good camera that shoots good quality pics then i recommend avoiding this digicam.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Features. Horrible Quality", "Author": "D. Langston", "ReviewID": "RSAYOEGGF7SYJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera from Target on Black Friday for a great price: $89. It also came with a nifty little carrying case (soft but still, it's a case), USB charging cable, and because it's an exclusive Target item (well, I guess in brick & mortar stores anyway) it came with coupons for free prints.The camera has a laundry list of features. Chances are you'll spend at least 30 minutes or more looking at all the different settings you can get with this camera. You can take 16:9 shots (perfect if you're viewing these on a widescreen HDTV) even panoramic settings. But the moment I viewed the photos on my computer I saw the camera's one major flaw: noise all over the photos.And by noise I'm referring to the \"colored snow\" that appears on a photo, which from my research is basically the pixels coming together to form the picture. This is normal in most cameras unless you're using the top of the line camera (like an SLR).I tried playing with multiple settings trying to get better pictures from it and while some tests were okay it wasn't fool proof. In the end it required way too much to get a proper setting from the camera to reduce the noise. And even when I did reduce it the results were normally a photo that was either too blurry or blown out highlights.Bottomline, great features but it fails in the most important category: taking high quality photos. In my book I'd rather have a camera with one button and takes great photos than a feature rich piece of electronics that takes crappy pictures.Don't buy this camera. For an alternative I've read great things about the Kodak V1253.
