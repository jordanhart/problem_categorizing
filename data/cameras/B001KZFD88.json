{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Nikon Coolpix S52 - Still A Great Point And Shoot Camera Option, Though Others Are Also Compelling", "Author": "Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"", "ReviewID": "RQ5LDIV76KSAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix S52 Digital Camera (Eco-Green) is a very good all-around point and shoot camera. I have begun using one of my other cameras more for my point and shoot needs.  But the pricing of this guy and some of its features are good enough I have continued to recommend this model and give them as gifts.The Canon's have some advantages and wider popularity. The Canon PowerShot SD790IS has won me over including many of the best features of both brands in one unit.  However, it is a more expensive unit than this one.  Thus I still think this makes a great camera for a gift though.FEATURESThe screen on this camera is still one of the best, clocking in at an AWESOME 3 inches of clear and durable optical glass.  This has the nicest screen out of any point and shoot camera out there, though the opaque controls on the Canon's screen are slicker.  You may want to get a screen protector.  But careful handling of mine has proven to me that the glass is very durable and not easily scratched.The control wheel lets you scroll through your photos when displaying them on the screen for review.  It only takes one button to delete a picture.  It's also easy to access all the menu functions.  Switching between camera mode and video recorder mode is just as easy, and reviewing your pictures via play mode is accomplished with one button as well.There are some interesting functions, included red-eye correction and image cropping.  Once again, most people will be loading their pictures on their computers and then dealing with those edits.  Still, it's nice to be able to edit on the camera in a pinch.The zoom on this camera is internal as with all S50 and S51 models.  That means no waiting for the lens to zoom in and out, and no worries about the mechanical issues with those external lens extension cameras. That makes it easier to accept the 3x optical zoom. This is one feature that the Canon 790IS does not have.This is a huge plus for this camera, and helps to maintain the slim profile. Some of those super-slim cameras aren't nearly as thin when they are turned on and the lenses are sticking out. There are thinner cameras, but none of them are as affordable and as packed with features as this one.Digital zoom should be ignored when making your purchasing decision.  Always compare cameras to each other with the optical zoom in mind.This is an update to the S50 and S51 versions and adds more megapixels (9MP) so that you can capture larger format prints up to 16X20.  Those who prefer a lower megapixel setting can adjust this downward via the setup menu, but at least this allows you the larger format option.The a lag in picture taking has become more of a nuisance for me over time.  Using the \"hold-then-click\" technique worked best for me.  The Auto settings are good enough for basic uses, but many situations require for more adjustments than most point and shoot cameras.I tested the S52's low light performance by setting the ISO manually.  The results were somewhat surprising and produced better quality pictures in low light than auto settings.  The low light performance of the Nikon is still one of the best.The body of the camera is nice and thin.  When you consider that the lens is internal and does not protrude, this guy is thinner than almost everything out there, including the Casio Exilim.The video recording features are pretty basic and have fallen behind newer alternatives.  The video quality is great, but sound quality could be improved.  Video quality depends on your memory card quality and speed even more than pictures.  The internal memory card slot is SDHC compatible so choose a nice class 6 card till a faster class hits the consumer market.  Keep in mind that most computers aren't SDHC compliant so get a set with an SDHC reader included or transfer pictures with your camera cable.  It's annoying that they used a non-standard cable, but it's not a deal breaker for me.One con you should be aware of is that your battery will need to be recharged after a few full days of use.  That is pretty normal, but it is annoying not to have a spare battery.  So get yourself a spare battery and keep it charged.  Because this uses one of those proprietary batteries, it doesn't offer the ease of use that comes with models that use AAs like the P60.  The other con is that you have to buy a little case for this camera, which seems like something that should be included.THE COMPETITIONThe Nikon Coolpix S52c 9MP Digital Camera Zoom with Wi-Fi has all the good stuff that's included with the S52 plus the added wireless antenna and related feature for only $30 to more.  Unfortunately, the wireless feature is not as effectively implemented in this model as in previous versions.  But all it would take is a firmware update to fix it.  Considering the small price difference, it may be worth having.  Still, those who save money by not getting the wireless version are not missing too much.There are too many new cameras in the point and shoot space to keep track of.  I like the internal lens and nice durable screen of the S52.  The new Nikon Coolpix S60 attempts to integrate a full touch screen and removes the controls to match up with the Sony Sony Cybershot DSC T300.  I actually like the controls on this one, and both of those are a bit expensive for my tastes.Other things to consider with Sony is that you must use their proprietary Memory Pro / Duo cards, which are more expensive. The T300 has a thin body, but the sliding lens cover adds considerable thickness.Canon has several top models, most popular among them being the Canon PowerShot SD1100ISand my personal favorite the SD790 IS.  The 1100 is comparable in price but the 790 is a little bit more.  The newer Canon PowerShot SD880IS also should be considered depending on your preferences if you have a bigger budget.There are good reasons for choosing any of those, but none of them have the internal lens.  If you want that feature, the Nikon stands alone.  For regular shooting conditions, Canon's image processing system is faster and more reliable.  So if you hate lag, it's a little bit better on the Canon.CONCLUSIONThis camera is an option for gifts and everyday general use.  The main cons are the lag and the battery, and the Canon models each offer improvements in those areas.  Now that the Canons have come down in price, this unit has less of a cost advantage.  This camera is better than those in durability and form factor with a nicer screen and slimmer body.  And for those who are concerned about the environment, the specially priced green model adds some peace of mind.Happy hunting.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "All time favorite camera", "Author": "Ella Dodge", "ReviewID": "R11KCO2VEITEPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A top notch \"point and shoot\" camera!  Have taken some stunning photographs, even in limited lighting.  I wore out the first camera..the plastic clip that holds the battery door closed snapped off.  However, with a little Yankee ingenuity, managed to drill a small hole and insert a piece of bent wire to replace the clip and still use the camera as a spare.  Even though the technology has further advance since purchasing this model, it's still a favorite.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rubbish", "Author": "Grace G", "ReviewID": "R3FR8D4C3DXL8A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this camera for 3 years and it sucks. Terrible camera with horrible building quality. There's literally dust inside the screen. I don't even know how it even got inside.The quality of the pictures are ok. I mean if you are shooting scenery in the daytime. Avoid shooting at night since the flash is horrible.It also takes time for you to take a simple picture. It auto focuses and then takes the picture.Avoid this camera at all cost. It is not worth spending money for this dinky camera.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good...if You're a Patient Person", "Author": "K.

I'm pleased, I'll keep it, but I'm learning to have patience with it. The process of actually taking a picture lasts for several seconds. This is a no go for action shots. Soccer moms, look elsewhere. My only other negative with this camera was that when I took a video and attempted to load it to my computer the video didn't transfer. The pictures around the video did, and I was using the same Nikon computer software I used for my S6 but no go on the video. Despite that I've gotten some great shots, great color capture, and am satisfied. Love the green casing, the color in the picture is true to life.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "My Coolpix", "Author": "Gina G.", "ReviewID": "R2075GM2D169OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my camera.
