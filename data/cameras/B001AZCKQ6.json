So that's a relief. I am not sure if it is reasonable to expect the internal memory to be better for this product. The user guide is very disappointing. It has very little information, and so I am trying to experiment with different settings to determine how to optimize the use of this camera. The photos appear grainy, but perhaps that's acceptable for a camera of this quality. I am a novice and would feel more comfortable if the manual were more informative. I'm still not giving up, and I can give it 3 stars for now.May 7, 2010 update:I found a comprehensive user's manual on [...]. It's 93 pages. My friend said that Polaroid probably didn't include it because it would mean they'd have to charge more for the camera. So now, I believe it's fair to give it 4 stars, however, I'm still experimenting, and may post another update later. By the way, [...] lists the retail price at $79.99.

Well once we received it and compared it to the expensive camera I purchased (KODAK)for myself I was blown away. The pictures were brighter, sharper, colorful, the screen was GIGANTIC compared to mine. The function buttons were not sitting on top of one another and the share features were very easy to do. The video and sound was amazing, I swear you would have thought I had a camcorder.

Amazon's free super saver shipping was nothing at 5-7 business days. My new camera arrived safely packaged within 3 days of my purchase online at night. I opened the box, and unwrapped my several orders. The Camera was certainly orange, but not at all as neon orange as the picture Amazon is using. Everything was included in the box, and in great shape. I plugged the battery and charger into the wall immediately, and the charger has a very noticeable red light that comes on when the battery is not fully charged. It changes to green once the battery is ready. I waited 2 hours and the battery indicator was green (probably had some juice in it already, but fairly quick full charge). I plugged in the battery, and the kingston mini SD card (in an attachment to fit the polaroid), and the camera was ready to run. Very first impression is the bright, and clear resolution on the 3\" screen. The features are all VERY straight-forward (this coming from a huge novice in cameras, but have have done a LOT of research on them). The camera is well worth the cheap price on it right now. I think if it goes up more in the 100's range again, you could get something a little more your taste, but it's a VERY good affordable camera. I recommend getting an SDHC card for memory expansion, and Amazon ALWAYS has a good deal on random memory cards. I picked up 2X 2GB mini SDHC cards that had SDHC adapters for less that $5. The camera is GREAT, and I will certainly update this comment if I feel the need to change the rating.

But it took horrible pictures and quickly stopped working. I've been waiting for the right camera to replace the one that broke.This camera is the perfect price for a quality camera. The beautiful orange color is unique. It is compact in size and appears durable.Since the dimensions are not listed anywhere, and you may need them for a case, they are: 3\u00be\" x 2\u00bc\" x \u00be\".The camera can be used strictly as a point and shoot (which is what my 6 year old does) but also allows you to control many features like the flash, wide angle, telephoto, and scene.It does take video but we haven't gone there yet. I'm afraid my computer will be overloaded with long videos of our dog walking around. As it is, 80% of the photos she takes are of the dog.The photos are clear and have good color. It focuses easily and saves the picture quickly.The battery is a rechargeable and the camera comes with the recharge unit for plugging in. The camera can connect to your computer through a USB cable but the Sandisk can also be taken out and read directly.UPDATE:I purchased another one of these cameras for a client who needed a small but clear camera to take shots at summer camp. We bought it in conjunction with the Polaroid CZA-10011B PoGo Instant Mobile Printer (Black) so that they could take camper pictures and instantly print them for a camp \"Passport\".

I think they might have had it for 24 hours and returned it to me with a letter stating they could not duplicate the problem. I turned it on about three times and it worked perfectly, but on the fourth try it turned on and froze. I took out the battery to turn it off. then put the battery back in and turned it on and as soon as the screen lit it turned itself off.

I was hesitant, due to the price. Anything under $100 seemed too low for a decent camera.  I thought that the low price probably meant low quality. This camera got so many positive reviews, though, that I went ahead and purchased 2. I was not disappointed! These cameras are terrific. And for this price, you can't go wrong. My kids had no trouble figuring out how to use them. The battery is easy to charge and install. The picture quality is good. It was easy to download the photos onto our Mac (iPhoto) and edit them. Shipping was fast - and free if you're an Amazon Prime member. The battery lasted a long time between charges, until my sons discovered the video capabilities during a particularly long stretch of driving. They made silly videos in the back seat for several hours. I was happy that they were entertained, but it drained the battery. We recharged them that night at the hotel. The video quality is not particularly high. I have no problem with this, as we have a separate video camera. I only wish this camera was available in more color choices so each child could have had a different color.  And, you do need to buy a memory card.Update:  A year later these cameras are still going strong!  My son's have taken them on vacations and to camp.  No problems.  The strap on one broke, but I was able to find a polaroid replacement strap for this exact camera model right here on Amazon.  [....].

Now it's even less (although I did get free shipping). Gol-lee, I love the combination of a great product and a steal of a deal.And what a great feature list: image stabilization (a must-have, in my experience); small LiIon battery and charger (I was able to pick up some Kodak batteries that are compatible with it for about $1.50 each); face and smile recognition; big, clear 3-inch LCD; and more. Most of all, the t1031 features simple operation, meaning even my wife (or anyone else) can use it. And I don't have to worry about remembering how to access an obscure, infrequently-used function that my aging mind hasn't seen for over a year.The t1031 has a flaw, though. For some reason, Polaroid put an \"anti-shake\" button next to the on/off button, making it easy to flip inadvertently. For this reason, it's a good idea to check the screen for the \"anti-shake\" icon before depressing the shutter. But what's the purpose of such a switch in the first place? Why would anyone ever turn image stabilization off? If there is a reason for it--for performance purposes, for instance--this feature would be better implemented in a menu selection.Something to get used to: non-standard placement of the T/W button. Instead of left-right orientation, this one is up/down, with T(ele) on top. No big deal.A month before I got the Polaroid I bought my spouse a Sony camera for about 3 times what I paid for the Polaroid, partly because of how much Sony users tend to rave about them. The photos taken by the Polaroid are superior, with noticeably less noise; the Sony menu system is confusing and has resulted in lost shots; and I don't want to hear the words \"Memory Stick\" ever again.About the only thing more I would want out of this camera is a larger zoom range, but you cannot realistically expect it for the price (yet). Today, if you're in the market for a camera of this type, and/or this is your price range, I'd get one of these without hesitation.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "suprised", "Author": "MF26", "ReviewID": "RCP9D0WF7GDMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I BOUGH THIS ON A WHIM WONDERING WHY IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE AS THE COMPETITION.

I came back from vacation this week,and was decided to return it, but now the return limit expired, so basically I've got the monkey on my shoulder! Besides, the camera has some annoying specs that can bother you even when it works fine. It takes too long to take the shot once you hit the shutter button.

Well come to find out this suposed new item I was sold from AMAZON's 3rd party seller had tampered with the camera and made the warranty invalid. Although they claimed it was new. I contacted Amazon they said there was nothing they could do that I should contact THEIR 3rd party seller. They were aware of the first issue but didnt care. I contacted the seller who is New Harbor they didnt respond. So if you buy this camera go directly through Polaroid they will atleast fix the problem because if they sell you a defective camera they will take responibility.

In addition to this, you have the option of changing the screen size, something I was not able to do with the other 2 cameras I owned, and it can be fun. I also purchased a 4 GB SD card as a bundle package with this camera, so I have well over 3,000 pictures left even though I've already taken 100 (I've had the camera for about 2 months).  The only complaint I have? I've noticed this stated by other reviewers, too. The battery life is HORRIBLE! When I'm taking pics quite a bit, it only lasts a couple of hours, and that's on a full charge. I then have to charge it with the battery charger that's included, but to get the battery completely charged takes a few hours. SUCKS!!

I have to manually set the ISO to 800 or 1600 to get a reasonable shutter speed in even moderately low light.- Resets to default still picture settings when you switch back and forth to video mode- No dedicated button for video mode, you have to go through the menu to switch between video and still shots- Non-standard battery and no on-board battery charger, which means you almost have to buy another battery and haul around the custom charger that comes with the camera- Insufficient low-end shutter speed for long-exposure night shots- Not impressed with Polaroid customer serviceI bought this case for the camera, and have been very happy with it: Case Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black)I am using this SDHC memory card, and I am happy with it too:  Transcend 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6EI also bought this spare battery, which has been adequate but not great:  iTEKIRO 800mAh Replacement Battery for Polaroid t1031 t1035 t1234 t1235 Digital Cameras", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had it for Less than a year, BROKEN", "Author": "Aimee Freudeman", "ReviewID": "RJQH1QRJ9UOI3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this cute camera for christmas of 2010.

My previous digital camera still works a Nikon Coolpix 4300 4MP. so going from a 4MP to a 10MP is a huge leap.As with my old Nikon, the one thing I dislike about this Polaroid is the proprietary battery.
