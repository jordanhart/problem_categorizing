{"Reviews": [{"Title": "best digital camera ever", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R24CTUXUI860Y1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first encounter I had with this camera was in Jamaica 2010, in a swimming pool around several young adults.  The camera was kicked around and underwater many times throughout the trip.  The pictures taken were so focused both in and out of the water and throughout the abuse.  However, it wasn't my camera, but one of those I had to have.  Sadly, when I looked for it they did not have the same model, there was an upgraded model (3000) so I purchased it hoping for the same performance.  I am soooo incredibly happy with this camera.  Still taking the best shots, in and out of water, the additional features are easy to use.  Pictures can be edited and cropped on the SD card and saved on the camera. You can easily print the pictures on the printer without using a computer.  And! it was available in pink.  The price at the time was great,I expected to pay $230, and it went down to $175 which included shipping/handling and tax.  (even less now I see!!) Fast shipping too.  I have never written a review before but I couldn't let this one go by since I am so happy with this camera.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Reset and Startup", "Author": "James Dewberry", "ReviewID": "R2CAHHNRMO500G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In general this camera takes nice pictures and served our original intended purpose well. We bought it as a nice camera for our 6 year old daughter since she could not harm it.  It would also allow us to take pictures at the beach or pool without worry.  The downside which is why I am giving it a 1 is that when the camera resets (like many electronic items do) it requires being connected to a computer to startup.  In our case the camera died while on a snorkeling excursion in the Bahamas.  We could not use the camera for the rest of the excursion or the rest of our trip because it needed to connect to a computer to work again.If they would fix the software in the camera so you could start using it by just setting the date and time like every other camera I have ever owned it would not be a big deal.  But to make the camera useless because it decided to reset is a waste of our money.  I have contacted Olympus and they think something is wrong with the camera and I can pay to have it repaired but that is not the issue. Bad design of software is the issue. Electronics will have to be reset or will reset as is its nature. Making a device which can not be used after it does reset without connecting to a computer is worthless.I don't have many pictures from our trip the Bahamas thanks to Olympus.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Shell", "ReviewID": "R3QWMN58IMH6ER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my daughter who goes snokeling alot.

This camera takes great pictures in the water and awesome pictures during the day. The clarity on the daytime pictures is really good. I kept my old digital camera for night-time and indoor pictures, so I bought this camera primarily for outdoor use. I am very happy with my purchase, especially for the price!", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gift !", "Author": "frenchie", "ReviewID": "R3RDW9DDTLFE16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift but I know from the person receiving same, that it was as described, in great packaging, etc.  Thank you for great  service !!", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid camera", "Author": "William Radtke", "ReviewID": "R3E61ZA152DFQN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for our teenage daughter who is rough on things.  1 minute after taking the camera out of the box she dropped it - but that's what this camera is built for.

I have taken pictures under water, at the beach, and everywhere else I have gone this summer. Not sand, water, or falls have done damage. It is pink (which was a neccesity for me) and fits into my purse. Because it is so tough I dont worry about putting a case on it, although I probably should.I also love that you can edit the pictures right on the camera, but unfortunatly the in camera editor hasnt been able to remove red eye. It is useful for cropping.The only downside is the battery life, which I find shorter than I would like and the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tw0LittLeToughGuys", "Author": "Lauren R. Christiansen \"iLoveMyBoys\"", "ReviewID": "R3S4XOOJQQATB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a mom of two young boys that like to get into everything, and throw everything! In the last year I have had two digital cameras broken from being dropped causing the lens to get stuck, \"lens error\" pops up and camera is junk. So I figured that when searching for yet another camera, this one sounded perfect! I was so excited when buying it I even got the one day shipping! It has been dropped a few times and finally, no errors! The lens doesn't come out or retract in so there will be no issues with that thank god. I haven't tried it in the water yet just because I am too scared, but I'm sure the day will come when one of my monsters throws it in the pool, and I am pretty confident that it will still work =)  The only thing I don't like about this camera is that the buttons are hard rubber, so you have to push them kind of hard. Its not difficult, its just one of my pet peeves. I like the metal buttons I think they are easier and smoother, I don't know. But other than that the camera is PERFECT!!!", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Love It!", "Author": "Samantha", "ReviewID": "R2CKTE72N95RGM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[...] I am an avid lover of my Olympus Stylus 3000. This compact, and powerful little stylish bubble camera has been the answer to everything that I could possibly ask for.When Digital Camera's first came out onto the market my very first camera I received was a little digital Olympus from my dad as a gift..I bet it was something like 5mega pixels or something - but and I loved it too. I carried the little thing everywhere telling my story in self portraying photographs...Then somewhere along the lines I decided to take a photography course and upgraded to a Minolta DIMAGE A.2. The BEST on the market at that time (this was in 2004). It was 10 mega pixel SLR and I spent $1100 on that camera.... I hated it. I still dont really know how to use it. Not to mention that Minolta has now become extinct - so I couldnt even buy parts if I wanted to. For YEARS I had this Minolta this BiG honkin' piece of machinery.... That I simply hated carrying around...Now its 2010, and it was time for an upgrade. Really I was looking for a new still camera that I could compact with me everywhere I went, but there was a catch. I wanted video capacity and HD preferably... Something Cute, and not to expensive...Then TaDa! This little stylus perked up its little face on Amazon.com. Now the first thing that attracted me to this little Olympus was his price...he was comparably priced at approximately $200, and of course because I once had a Olympus before that I very much loved, we instantly had a connection. Then he continued to tell me about himself...\"I'm waterproof\" he said seductively. \"You can carry me around with you, anywhere, and we will have an amazing time...you'll never have to worry about me because not only am I susceptible to water, up to 3 meters... but I'm also Shockproof\" he said cockily to me. \"I'm a Stylus Tough, and I'm one of a kind.\"How could I not fall in love with such a wonderful little camera?But before I could commit to him; I need to feel him, hold him in my hands and KNOW for sure that he was the one for me. So I looked around looking for my prince charming camera. I met many other camera's in the process... but none of them were stacking up to the stylus that I read about on Amazon.comThen Finally I found him! He came in 4 different colors to choose from, but I knew that I wanted him in Red. The clerk as he was showing him to me, was as charismatic as the camera, and I knew that we were a perfect fit. Today was the day that I getting my new little Olympus Stylus 3000!He was perfect to hold in my hand, and I liked that his lens was not retractable. To me, that was a feature that was less likely to cause me to send him away to the warranty hospital. His buttons on the back are rubberized and soft. Everything about this camera is fun and noninvasive. He has many \"magic\" features, and a wide arrange of capture settings such as `cuisine' and `pets'. My favorite setting is the pinhole, and popart in the magicbox. But you can also stencil and create coloring pages!The only downfall that I have about this little camera is uploading the video. The video feed is only compatible in Quicktime (MP4) and I have to convert all my videos in order to alter them in moviemaking which compromises the quality - quite a bit. And when you are recording video you cannot zoom. you can zoom before you start recording and it will work, but once the red little button has been pushed that's it! no changes missy! and unfortunately the features don't work in video either... so no popart videos :(Besides that, I highly recommend this Powerful little 12mp, Stylus Camera![...] Samantha is a part of what is arguably to be the World's Largest Internet Marketing School available.
