The auto-focus works great in various lighting conditions, and I have never had a photo come out blurry.  The batteries seem to die fast, so I always carry an extra set.I am purchasing another one of these for my 7 year old, because it is inexpensive for the quality of the photos.  The shutter speed is quick enough for his always-moving hands, and the buttons are simple enough for him to easily operate.  This is exactly what I have been looking for.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great while it lasted", "Author": "Mictown78", "ReviewID": "R1EVQPPB0Q2075", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera worked great, for the first 7 weeks I owned it. I purchased this camera for the Lomo feature. The camera took decent pictures. The reason I give the item 2 stars is that on the 53rd day I owned the product, it would not turn on. I thought it might have been a dead battery, so I plugged it into the charger, but the USB/Power LED did not light up. Despite reseating the battery and trying different USB cables, I could not get the camera to operate again.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "this is amazing!", "Author": "Gunner45", "ReviewID": "R3E9GUNDQYQ35D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is everything i would want in a camera!!!!!!!! i love it i bought it last night got an sd card so easy to use you can edit your pics you can make REAL movies you can stop in the middle and start again! i would recommend this to ANYONE !", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "... while on vacation so I knew it was a good", "Author": "sharon k. peterson", "ReviewID": "R1LYQO3TT9JHIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera before and it was lost while on vacation so I knew it was a good camera", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've ever owned", "Author": "Carlene", "ReviewID": "R1VEBM2Q7F190", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is so easy to use and takes wonderful pictures.
