{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best camcorder if you're on a budget and need external mic input", "Author": "Derrick A. Jeror", "ReviewID": "R3TR6TJ9OH2IB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Check out my sample footage video on Youtube. On Youtube search \"djeror zi8 low light\"In my previous review of the Kodak Zi8 I was pretty frustrated at the fact that whenever I used the built in microphone the recorded videos had an annoying high pitch whine that made the audio from my videos almost unusable. Kodak recognized that this was an issue and created a firmware update that fixed the problem. It also fixed a few other things like the previous issue of the image getting darker as you zoomed in. They seem to have fixed all of the major problems with this firmware fix.I do tech product reviews so I need the following things:- External mic input - most of my videos are shot wearing a lapel mic- Macro mode - I have to get close to little tiny screens- SDHC memory - I go to all day trade shows, I need 10+ hours of video- Power options - I need to be able to shoot while AC power is plugged in or use a large external battery.- Under $200 - I'm poor.Because of these requirements no other camcorder can fit my needs. One cool thing about this camera is that it is much more upgradable than the other pocket cameras on the market.Con:-The built in microphone is OK now that they fixed the whining noise, but it's still not amazing.Work-around:- Don't use the internal mic... I use an Audio Technica lapel mic for 1 person interviews.Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone For events I ordered a Sony stereo mic to use instead of the built in mic. Sony ECM-DS70P Electret Condenser Stereo Microphone . Although I wish that Kodak made the internal mic better, for the most part I am kind of excited that the Sony stereo mic will give me  much better sound than any of the standard internal mics that any of the pocket cams have.Con:-Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) sucks a lot of juice. Also the Zi8 uses a proprietary battery rather than cheap swappable AA's. Battery life when shooting non-stop is 1hr 16min in 720p 60fps with EIS on. If you turn off EIS you get about 1hr 41min at 720p 60fps.Work-around:- Use the USB to power cable that comes with the camera in conjunction with an external battery source. This is a must if you are going to be recording for more than an hour with EIS, cause that's about what the internal battery will give you. Tekkeon TekCharge Rechargeable Li-Poly Battery You can just stick this battery pack in your pocket and connect the charging cable to the Zi8. This will allow you to record for a super long amount of time. I haven't tested to see what my total record time with the battery pack will be but it should be around 5X the standard recording time. (about 6 hours with EIS on, almost  9 with it off) This gives you the best battery life of almost any camcorder. Sure it's an extra cost, but when you're at an all day trade show you don't have to worry about running out of juice.Con:- Image stabilization can't rescue video you shoot while moving around. Any camera motion makes video awful.Work-round:- Accept the fact you should probably be using a mini tripod with this camera or at least stand still. Also, although it takes a bunch of time to process if you have the new iMovie the image stabilization processing you can do is light years beyond what the EIS in the Kodak Zi8 can do.One more important note. Make sure you buy high speed SDHC memory cards for this thing. If your SD card is not fast enough the camera will record for like 2 seconds and then stop with an error. It took me a while to figure out why the camera kept stopping recording when in HD mode but worked fine in SD mode. It was because of my old SD card. You need to make sure your SD card has a write speed of at least 9MB/s if you want to record in 1080p. These high speed cards cost more, but you need them for any camcorder that is going to record HD video to them, it's not just the Zi8. I think most Class 6 high speed SDHC cards should work.If you want to get the most out of this camera plan on spending an extra $100 - $150 in order to buy upgrade items. Personally I've come to the conclusion that the extra expenses were worth it. It all depends on what you plan on using the camera for. For a typical mom purse cam this would not be my recommendation, I would say go with a Flip Ultra HD. But for someone with particular needs like mine this camera may be the only one that fits the bill.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Value, awesome! But don't expect it to compete with $3000 camera", "Author": "R. Vernon \"R. Vernon\"", "ReviewID": "R24NLQQ739CN43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rarely will type/review products but I've been a little frustrated reading the reviews of this product on Amazon and by users at other sites.  Many users seem to think that this camera was designed to compete with expensive, professional cameras that cost thousands of dollars and produce full HD quality video.  That's not what this is. Also, while my camera hasn't had the 'noise' issue from the Mic, i have seen a camera that had the issue and its BARELY noticeable.  Its almost like a very quiet background noise from a Florescent light or something.Kodak has designed, marketed, and built a camera to compete with FLiP and has clearly produced a FAR better product.I'll keep it short and sweet and first explain who I am and what I am using this camera for.  I use it for:-Home Videos/Fun stuff with old buddies and friends-For work when I need some quick video that's easy to upload online, or put in iMovie and edit-For work when I need more complex videos that may require editing, or somewhat lengthy video but I want the ease of use/portability.I have seen some of the problems stated with the internal Mic and I have had none of them (I do have the upgraded Firmware that is now standard 1.03, and Kodak says this completely eliminates the issue...again have never had the issue on my camera).  A relative of mine was lucky enough to purchase this product when Kodak did an 'early' release a few months ago and occasionally his videos will have a bit of a higher pitched background noise, but it doesn't interfere with the sound from the video -- its just a light background noise that, honestly, i've heard on dozens of cameras.  Don't forget, without an external Mic the camera only records mono so -- the sounds quality isn't going to be great anyway!The video is great, image stability isn't as advanced as those available on more expensive cameras but it is better than anything i've seen in a FLiP or other Kodak model.  It does work and you can see a difference, even if its not huge.  Its SO easy to flip between video modes.  The 1080p is awesome, but sometimes its nice to move back down to 720 and the 60fps to capture 'action' footage.One negative -- which most people may see as a positive -- i do wish there were more settings, or at least the ability to play around with more features/edit modes.  Its GREAT easy to use, its a point and shoot video camera -- but with the great lens and abilities, it seems like Kodak could have -- pretty easily -- had this camera competing with much higher end cameras. If all the hardware was put to great use this could compete with $500+ cameras.  But I understand wanting to keep it simple.I like having the SD card.  Some people would prefer the internal memory, and yes by the time you buy a decent sized SD card the camera is more expensive than the FLiP, but, the FLiP has a very limited memory.  This camera is limited only by the size of the card...Definitely a positive!Finally, I know people that are both in the TV business and do a lot of Video blogging and they are drooling over this camera because of the external mic capabilities. One reason lots of 'pros' didn't like FLiP was because of the audio issues.  Kodak has solved those, not to mention providing better quality video.Again this isn't something to shoot with if your a young film-maker or a die-hard amateur cinematographer.  But if you need something cheap to get some great quality video, or need something super easy to use that is really portable....Take the plunge. And if your considering FLiP -- don't bother...", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Actual footage in different lighting conditions", "Author": "Richard C.

I erased the audio portion - it was just wind and ambient noise.  The original video is great quality - hopefully Amazon does not compress it too much!Christmas lights in front of the house, the tree inside the house, and some footage at the local gym (dark, medium and bright conditions!)I also shot some close-up footage with the close-up setting on and off so you can see how it works.All videos are recorded by the camera in .mov format.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great experience.", "Author": "Winston Wolfe \"I solve problems.\"", "ReviewID": "RF1FXOZM2RVU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I read all the same reviews you did on Amazon.  Some people love it some people have had problems.  I have not seen a product with such a wide range of reviews and was very leery.  I bought it locally at a store with a good return record as Amazon was out of stock with no ETA on new stock.I will start by saying, I have not had any of the problems that seem common here.  No lines, no funny squeals/hums, etc.  This unit came with the latest firmware installed (1.06).Reading the 4 and 5 star comments on Amazon, I would say they are in line with my own experiences.  For my needs this camera hits the mark on so many levels.My needs:- Small camera- Ability to record fast action movement of sports/dance activities- Extremely easy to play back on a computer AND television- Zoom. Optical would be great, but not needed for what I do.- A standard video format that could be edited by lots of different software.Major pluses that tipped the scale to this camera over others:- Removable memory.  I don't want to download everything to a computer when I am on vacation.  Swapping out the memory card is like loading film...I'll process it when I get home.- Removable Battery.  With all of my rechargeable tools/toys, I will use them more if I can swap out a run down battery and keep going.  This lesson was first learned with cordless drills, always buy a second battery so you can keep working.- Decent quality video for the size.  Look at another reviewer on Amazon. He did a decent job of recording in different lighting conditions to show you what to expect.  Similar videos were found on Youtube.Software:This seems to be a problem for a lot of people.  I really didn't expect much and knew from other reviews that the .mov format was compatible with Quicktime.  I would have preferred something I could use on Windows Movie Maker, but if the software did not work it was only $30 to upgrade to Quicktime Pro to edit.As an aside: I found it interesting that folks complained that only PC software was included.  What they didn't seem to understand is this .mov format works natively with the standard iMovie software on the Mac.All that said, the Arcsoft software loaded fine on an old laptop running XP.  Now, like any other video editing software, I had to close all other programs to keep the video from being jumpy when I edited or played it.The one interesting detour I did not expect was the 8GB SDHC card I bought for the camera was not something the old XP could read with it's built in SD card reader (SDHC did not exist when this computer was built).  It worked fine with a newer Vista based computer.  That said, flipping out the USB connection from the camera and plugging it into the XP laptop worked great.  The laptop treated the camera like a USB memory stick and the movies run in Quicktime.As to converting the .mov to something I can use (say .avi) with Windows Movie Maker, I did find some free tools listed by other reviewers that worked fine (RAD Video Tools - [...]) .What would I like to see different?  An adjustable focal length so I could get everyone in the shot across the table and still take the long shots.  I expect that will be years before this feature is affordable enough to put in a $200 camera.  I do look forward to that day as I bet we see optical zoom and detachable lenses to do fun things when that day comes.I think I got lucky in some areas and had different expectations in other areas.It appears that the early adopters had problems and Kodak was quick to fix them.  I received a newer model with the latest fixes (firmware) and possibly newer ArcSoft software.I never expected a $200 camera without optical zoom to take pictures of cameras costing twice as much and more.I never expect included software to be stellar as that has never been my experience with ANY product.  It should do the basics, and for me it did, although I probably won't use it given other free options.I have had video cameras in the past and recognize the need for good lighting, both on the subject and behind the subject.  That said, I am pleased with the video even in low-light situations as it is better than what I expected.If you need a small video camera that is very easy to use and share your videos, I would not hesitate to recommend this to you.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Using the Zi8 for Concert Recordings", "Author": "BC", "ReviewID": "R1KTWO3V6YB03U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm friends with a lot of Boston area musicians, and I have been very supportive of them. Near the beginning of the year, I started using a Kodak Zi6 in preparation for a video project involving the Boston area music community, mostly as proof of concept for the use of modern low-cost video technology in capturing music shows in a very naturalistic, unobtrusive manner. There was a long learning curve, mostly to do with processing the raw video and audio -- video cameras in general are not designed for the lighting and sound levels typical of club shows, and despite the limitations of the Zi6 -- not so good low light sensitivity, a mono-only mic, and the included software was useless for my purposes -- I ended up getting pretty good results.When the Zi8 was announced and that not only it was suppose to have better low light sensitivity and a higher resolution, but also image stabilization and a jack for an external stereo microphone, it was a no-brainer to get one. What was tricker was deciding on the microphone -- there were some video reviews on YouTube and such, but nobody was really recommending anything in particular. I did find one video using a Sony ECM-DS70P Electret Condenser Stereo Microphone and that seemed like it would work well: it was very compact, seemed to sound pretty good, and was relatively inexpensive. For the memory card, which you need, I just reused the 8 Gb SDHC cards I had bought for the Zi6. I had gotten spoiled with the battery life of the Zi6 -- a couple of cheap, rechargeable 2400mah NiMH AA batteries would be good for all night and nearly 4 Gb of recording. The Zi8 uses a compact lithium-ion battery that lasts maybe only a third as long. Amazon had exceptional deals, though, on both compatible batteries and a charger, so I ended up getting both 2 BATTERY+CHARGER FOR KODAK KLIC-7004 V1073 V1273 M1033 and Kodak KLIC-7004 / Fuji Np-50 / Pentax DL-I68 Compatible Li-Ion Battery. Even though the specs on these batteries give them a higher capacity than the Kodak battery that comes with the Zi8, they've so far been lasting about 80-90% as long. For the price, though, they were/are exceptional deals.I starting using the Zi8/Sony mic combo back at the beginning of October and the overall improvement over the Zi6 was immediately obvious: even at the same 720p resolution, the Zi8 produced much sharper, cleaner video in a club environment, and the Sony mic just rocked in terms of sound quality. The Zi6 for a long while was reputed to have the best internal mic of all the pocket digital camcorders, but the Zi8 with the Sony just blew it away. The best thing about the Zi6's mic, though, was that it was nearly impossible to make it clip -- it was able to handle insane volume levels. The only times it had trouble was with very, VERY high bass volume levels. The only drawback to the Zi8/Sony combo is that it can't quite handle the same volume levels, especially if there is excessive midrange on the vocals. The Zi8 has an microphone input level control, but even at its lowest setting, I've had a couple of instances where vocals cracked due to excessive  midrange volume at around 640khz. But bear in mind that is while standing near the stage and by the speakers at a rock show mixed with too much midrange. But so far, for easily most of the rock shows, the audio has turned out superb with the same processing tricks I learned using the Zi6.There is one proviso with the audio: I now always extract the audio and use a separate audio editor (something like the free Audacity editor) to clean it up before adding it back to the video (which is actually easier than it sounds). I did notice that there was very narrow \"dip\" (more like a reverse spike) at about 7900khz that wasn't correctable, but it was narrow enough and at a high enough frequency not to be noticeable. I thought that this was a Sony mic characteristic, but I recently upgraded the Zi8's firmware to 1.06, and the \"dip\" shifted downwards to about 5500khz, and was a little bit wider, but not nearly as steep. You would think that this would be more noticeable, but that it's now much more correctable than when it was at 7900khz, and the audio overall sounds cleaner than before the upgrade.The biggest weakness with both the Zi6 and Zi8, and in general with all video cameras, as well as cameras that do video, is the software. Pretty much all concert videos need some adjustments for brightness, contrast, saturation and maybe hue, and the audio usually needs to be corrected with something like a graphic equalizer at the least. This is basic stuff, but nobody seems to include good software for this. The Zi8 comes with ArcSoft's MediaImpression, but while it does allow some good basic adjustments to picture quality, there is nothing for audio adjustment. Both the Zi6 and Zi8 save videos in Apple's Quicktime \"Mov\" format, and there isn't a whole lot on the Windows PC side that deals with this cheaply and easily. I tried Apple's Quicktime Pro, which is relatively cheap at $30, but I found it too slow, too limited, and too poorly designed to bother with for regular use. I also tried different conversion programs, but you always loose detail with every conversion. I ended up using VirtualDub, which is free, and some free plugins for it. But VirtualDub is not able to directly open up MOV without some geeky trickery, the details of which are beyond what I can put here. Probably for most users, another free program, Avidemux, will likely do. It's not really meant for beginners, but you can find beginner guides easily enough online. There are some $99 programs that *might* do, but my experience with a trial version of one of them wasn't the best, and you need a lot of horsepower to deal with a 720p video resolution. Even when using compact, no nonsense VirtualDub for processing, it typically takes my stripped-down 3 Ghz Pentium D system about an hour on average to process a typical 4 minute concert video for uploading to YouTube.Anyone interested in my personal results can just do a YouTube search for \"MelodyMatters\" and all the videos there from the beginning of October to the present (except for one), were done with a Zi8.

Overall, I feel that zi8 is a significant improvement over the previous model. The video quality is definitely better than zi6 in all conditions, whether outside in bright sunlight or indoors in low light. The firmware is superior giving a more user friendly interface and buttons layout is much nicer. Unlike zi6 where setting menus was hidden, this time you get direct access to settings including controlling the screen brightness, altering mic sensitivity, turning image stabilization on/off and enabling/disabling face recognition.I think this is a great video camcorder at a great price. Go for it!-------------  update: Sep 24 2009 --------------Upgraded to the latest firmware 1.03, and this eliminated the background noise in my recordings completely! Wow. Thanks Kodak for listening to costumers and quickly fixing the mic bug.[...]", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "A giant waste of time and money", "Author": "Justin T. Marx", "ReviewID": "R2DBLKQBKBCXKC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll try to keep this as short as possible.  I bought this camera a month ago directly from the Kodak online store.  Upon arrival, the camera displayed noticeable vertical lines in all of the modes except 1080p.  These vertical lines appeared both on the external LCD display as well as when the files were transferred to a computer.  I tried three different SDHC cards (all class 6), and upgrading the firmware.  No dice.  Additionally, the internal microphone had that high pitched whine sound that has been mentioned a lot (contrary to what many say, the firmware did NOTHING to fix this problem, at least for me).  I called Kodak's tech support, and they told me the camera would need to be sent in for repairs, covered under warranty.  I had to pay $20 non-reimbursed shipping to send it off, but I did anyway.  The facility, an outsourced repair center called Precision Camera and Video Repair had the camera for about three weeks.  They claimed they replaced the main CPU and power circuit.I received the camera yesterday, exactly one month after I initially received it, and the same exact problems persist.  Once again, I tried different cards and upgraded firmware.  No help whatsoever.  Additionally, the repair facility scratched the external screen up pretty good, something that was NOT there when I sent it in.  So I called tech support again, and said I want a new camera.  They said they can't do that, and that I would need to send it back...to the SAME repair facility, and spending my OWN shipping costs again.  I said that was unacceptable, and they transferred me to store customer service.  They said that they could not replace the camera since it had been repaired...something that tech support assured me would fix the problem.  I was livid at this point, and demanded a supervisor.  After re-explaining the situation for what seemed to be the 50th time, she supervisor told me that she would need to get authorization from upper management, and that she would give me a call back tomorrow (today...still no call, but it's early).  She said if they approved it, I would get an email with a shipping label and to send the camera back.  Once they receive the camera, I will be refunded, and can reorder a new camera.  I will be refunded my initial shipping costs, but not the cost I paid to send it in for repair.  So not only am I a month into this, with no working camera, but I spent an hour on the phone, with no ultimate resolution...yet.Here's the moral of the story.  First, don't send it in for repair, demand a new camera.  Second, go through Amazon, and avoid Kodak's customer service at all cost.  Third, don't buy this camera.  The 1080p mode is nigh-useless (it zooms the frame in, narrowing the viewing angle and shooting width, thereby giving you a clearer picture...but much smaller and more narrow), the internal mic is garbage, and more likely than not, you're going to have a sensor problem (look in the forum below or google \"Zi8 vertical lines.\"  You'll see many people with the same problem I had) that isnt going to get fixed for you.  I dont mind buying an SD card, but when you factor in an external mic, tripod (the electronic image stabilization is also useless), and the headache of actually getting a working product, you're going to spend upwards of $300 and have a heart attack.  At this point, I will be taking my refund and running.  I will never buy a Kodak product again.  You send me a defective product, make me pay for the return costs for repair, DO NOT REPAIR THE ISSUE, and then try to tell me that I cant exchange it or get a refund...even though it's covered in the money-back warranty?  I don't think so.  Never again.  All that potential, and this camera is a cheaply made bust.I think I'm going to take my money, buy off Amazon, and get the Flip MinoHD 2nd Generation.  I have an Ultra HD and it's great, but bulky.  Only would like a mino for the portability.  I would have loved for the Zi8 to work.  External mic, expandable storage, 7209/60fps (this was the feature I was most jazzed about since it offers a much smoother video in \"action\" shots.  Too bad this was the very thing that was defective...twice), thin, sleek design, large screen...almost the perfect camcorder.  But as it stands, the issues with this camera far outweigh the benefits.  I would prefer something more versatile than the Flip line of cameras, but it's looking like thats a pipe-dream at this point.Thanks for reading.  It ran much longer than I would have liked, but I needed to get some of the issues off my chest.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not the perfect cam: shaky video and random high-pitched

surprising how practically none of the reviews (CNET, WIRED, etc.) talk about the high-frequency sound/whine when using the in-camera microphone. (One I saw used a Sennheiser mic-in, and when they unplugged the mic, you could hear the noise...) I feel like Superman when Lex Luthor sent that high-frequency message which only he and dogs could hears. I can't reproduce it reliably, and tested in quiet spaces and with different recording quality settings. It occurs in about 1/2 of my clips. I used a Radio Shack 33-3013 with it, and that sounds great. See the video review: 1st section is with the lapel mic (very visible), 2nd section is with the lapel mic, held next to the camera, 3rd section is with the built-in mic. I downsized the video, but the audio is 48KHz/16-bit.I wanted a cam with a decent mic so I wouldn't have to carry two things with me. I wonder if other reviewers listened to their footage in loud offices and couldn't hear it. Or this one is faulty.I also miss the wide-angle lens of the Creative Vado HD. I failed to find real numbers on the focal length, so I can only say the Vado is \"much\" wider. Macro mode, however, is lots of fun. (Check out Vimeo for a post on how to use magnetic wide-angle and macro lenses with a VadoHD...)I really wanted to love this camera, but I can't. The image stabilization may help with fast pans, but walking-footage looks pretty bad. If the sound can be fixed, or even attributed to certain situations/settings, it'd be much more usable. If someone else knows what's up, please comment.My perfect cam would be the Vado HD with its wide lens, add mic-in and interchangeable memory. I could replicate macro with little add-on, homegrown lenses. The VadoHD is smaller, and the non-shiny surfaces doesn't look finger-printy.Pros: interchangeable memory (I like to keep the camera rolling), macro modeCons: high-pitched whine with in-cam mic, narrower lens, footage looks much shakier than the Vado HD", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall, an excellent choice in this price range", "Author": "Joe Wood", "ReviewID": "R2VH393EJHMO3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have mentioned, you really need to add $20+ (for an SD card) to the price of this to compare it to Flip and other cameras with built-in memory (the Zi8 does have a small amount of onboard memory, but it's only enough to test the camera, not enough for any real use). That said, though, it's still a bargain.First, and most importantly, the video (and audio) quality is exceptionally good for a camera in this price range. No, it won't compare with a $1000+ camera - but it compares very well with Flip and the like. My initial video was made by following my four year old around the house as she explained things to me. Bright sunlight to dark hallways to lit rooms, close to and far from the camera, still and active. We recorded (at 720p/60fps) for ten minutes, then connected the Zi8 via the included HDMI cable to the TV and watched. I was quite impressed. I wouldn't expect the Discovery Channel to use these to film the sequel to the Planet Earth series, but for recording kids, pets, outside events (I also recorded my dog running around the yard), etc., it does very well. Color fidelity is good, and the built-in audio had no perceived issues. Adding an external mic makes it even better (my daughters use one and attach a tripod so they can interview each other).I'm a Mac user, so I can't speak to the ease of use of the included software, but I can say that the Zi8 connects easily to the Mac (the first time, I only saw the drive partition with the Windows software, but I ejected and plugged it back in, and from then on, I saw the image/video partition as well). The movies are all in H.264 format, so iMovie (or virtually any other video software) works well with them, and, as others have said, iMovie does jitter reduction well, so no need to waste camera batteries on image stabilization). Also, obviously, you can eject the SD card and use a card reader to import the movies and pictures on any OS.Speaking of pictures... the picture quality is adequate, but very much in the cellphone camera quality range - I wouldn't use this to take wedding photos or to document UFO sightings, but it's fine for the things you'd use your cellphone camera to snap.Ease of use is great, but I will admit that, at first, I took a lot of half-second videos because the camera begins taking video whenever you switch resolutions. Still, it's trivially easy to use.I rate it five stars because, for the price (even including an SD card), I was very impressed with what came with it (cables, etc), with the quality of the recordings and of the camera, with the ease of use, with the external mic option, with the removable battery, and with the overall experience.At under $200 with a memory card, it is currently the best of the pocket-cam options.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "A little Raspberry Wonder!", "Author": "Larry Gwaltney", "ReviewID": "RN6YCTHTFN4F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little gem arrived via UPS just last week, and I am extremely impressed with the combination of features, quality and performance. Three things to keep in mind - remember the price being paid, it's ease-of-use, what it can do, and you can fully appreciate this device for what it is. I work with output from the five-figure JVC HD cameras as part of my job, and you are not buying one of those. So it isn't appropriate to make comparisons between abilities and picture quality - and you also have to be very aware of lighting when using one of these.Having said all that, I was still amazed at some quick clips I shot at a nearby lake. I played them thru the included HDMI to my 42\" Samsung and was stunned at some of the resolution I saw. With careful placement of the camera and awareness of the lighting, it DOES approach broadcast-quality with the 1080p setting.I put together a quick pastiche of clips from my road tour and posted it here at YouTube: Search under the term: \"Lake Monroe Scenes.\" Also, check out another one I made called \"Autumn Dreams\" (under the name LGwalt).Here you can see for yourself the strengths and weaknesses of this camera. When I can have full control of the lighting, the results approach spectacular. The shots taken thru the windshield while the car is in motion can show you some of the problems with lighting adjustment going from shade to bright light. This was edited in Corel Studio Pro.

Toward the end of the vid, I demonstrate the external mic jack.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Two major drawbacks, but otherwise a fine unit for video and audio", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "R1P56UP09C24VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kodak Zi8 sounds good on paper, but in real life it has two major drawbacks in my opinion. First, the lens is 46mm (35 mm equivalent). This is way too constricting in ordinary social situations, say over the table in a restaurant booth. With an adult and two little kids sitting across from me, I could only shoot two of the three people. A 28mm lens would have captured all three - and I have 28mm on my point 'n shoot which shoots good video, though non-HD. (Newer models of the point 'n shoot do, at least 720p.) By the way, the Zi8 focal length is 46mm for 720p and WVGA settings. At 1080p, the focal length is 61mm. Second minimum normal focus is 39 inches, when set to normal. There is also a macro setting with a fixed focus of 5.9\". Three feet means you aren't going to be holding this at arm's length, for example, to get yourself in your own shots: you run a high risk of being out of focus. Frankly these two factors can be showstoppers. As I sit here contemplating the Zi8, I am tending to think that the focal length is a showstopper for me. But on to the features of the Zi8. Overall, it is a very nice unit. It is thicker and heavier than earlier Flip models but not excessively so. It will fit in a shirt pocket, but expect that pocket to droop from the weight. Kodak doesn't provide any kind of case in the box, not even a cheapo slip cover. The battery is user replaceable, which is a plus since Kodak says you'll get only 90 minutes run time from a battery. It charges in two hours from the AC adapter, 4 hours from a USB cable. Controls are minimal. An on-off switch which seems difficult to trip accidentally and four push buttons on the back for settings, deletion, record and play. The joystick is kind of on the clumsy side. Video quality at all settings (WVGA, 720p, 720p 60fps, 1080p) is excellent in good lighting. Low light performance is very poor. I tested low light in a room with a 75 watt ceiling mounted fixture and a computer monitor casting light on a person a foot or so away. Noise was visible in the image. The tests I ran at lower lighting levels were essentially unusable for any practical purpose. The unit will accept SDHC cards up to 32 GB. I used a much more affordable Class 6 16 GB card, which would accommodate 4 hours of 720p video. Transferring video from the SDHC cards is a snap. You can also use the cleverly engineered USB connector. On first use, you have the option of installing the supplied Arcsoft software will allow you, among other things, to convert the Quicktime MOV files to other formats. The internal microphone produced excellent to acceptable audio at distances ranging up to about 8 to 10 feet. Obviously, the further away the speaker is, the less acceptable the audio is. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an external mic to plug in and test. I did not experience the high pitched noise others complained about. Image stabilization seems to work moderately well, but if you shake a lot, it's not going to help - and it certainly is not capable of smoothing out any big bumps, like when you are walking. The 4X digital zoom is surprisingly good. Noise increases as you would expect, but not to the point of seriously degrading the image. A bigger problem is that the zoom motion is not smooth, so you'd best plan on setting the zoom first and then shooting. A remote control is available as an accessory, which might extend the usefulness of this camera. Still photo quality is moderate. In room lighting, I found that shutter speeds were so low that shake was inevitable. In terms of overall quality - if you can accept its two serious limitations with regard to focal length and minimum focus distance - the Zi8 ranks high as a video capture device and is mediocre (as might be expected) as a still camera. In terms of general utility, however, I have to question the utility and expense of a Zi8 against using a more expensive point 'n shoot that does 720p video. Obviously it depends on your needs, but at this point, having spent the day working with the Zi8, I am not yet convinced that it is a keeper.Jerry", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little video camera BUT expect some drawbacks", "Author": "PATRICK SALAZAR \"Patrick\"", "ReviewID": "R36GDROZCBS52C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Zi8 which I picked up Black Friday weekend for 150 bucks (thanks Amazon!).  I was impressed with the video I saw on sites like Vimeo, YouTube and even Flickr - what sold me is the external mic jack.I work for a local TV station and work with high-end digital video cameras all day so I was really looking forward to the Zi8.It was easy to use out of the box - the rechargeable battery takes 2 hours to charge which is no time at all (a second battery for \"just in case\" moments will run you less than $30.  The booklet that comes with the camera is very easy to read but if you have additional questions you'll have to get them from the extended guide on Kodak's website. (The booklet gives you the exact web address so it's no big deal but yet a little frustrating).The camera is just a little bigger than my Blackberry, a little heavier but still easy to drop in my pock and go.  I actually kept it in my jeans during an event with no problem.IMPORTANT: The firmware (the camera's internal software) that ships in the box is 1.03 - you will need to update the firmware to 1.06 or you will get reddish streaks in your video.  You will notice them like I did if you take test footage against a white wall.  The update is easy to do and fixes the problem in less than 10 minutes.Like most reviews the shaky video is a problem.  I could understand a little trembling when the cam is zoomed in - that's a common problem with cameras.  BUT the video suffers in all modes even when fully zoomed out.  You're best bet will be a really steady hand and/or tripod.The color is amazing.  The Zi8 picks up colors you don't notice with your own eyes.  For instance, when shooting a brown chair next to a window with red drapes, the video actually picked up the red on the chair from the sunlight tinted by the drapes...I never noticed that in person.  Now, that can be a drawback since you will notice an abundant of colors in your video from various light sources.  For instance, in the living room you will pick up yellow light from lamps, blue light from the TV (if it's on) and yet more colors from other sources like the xmas tree.The sound from the Zi8's internal mic is impressive.  I was shooting a wide shot in the living room, TV on and the cat playing on the floor.  Not only did the cam pick up the TV sound but you could hear the tinkle from the tiny bell on the cat toy.  I recorded a conversation with someone in a room with a noisy carpet fan blowing about 6 feet away.  I thought that had blown the interview but to my surprise our voices were still easy to understand.The external mic is a wonderful extra and the option that talked me into buying the Zi8.  This is a nice extra if you're planning to use this camera for interviews or record people telling stories/explanations at special events like conferences, reunions or weddings.  You can also have the ability to set the audio level so you don't get distorted sound from your mic.I got a couple of SDHC cards on sale (Patriot 8G) and they work really well.  They do upload fairly quickly and there is a little lag but for a cheaper price I don't mind.Some think the rechargeable battery is a drawback but I think it's a good thing.  Although AA batts would be more convenient in a pinch, even strong ones would drain quickly when using the Zi8's features.So am I happy with the camera?  Yes, very...because I knew ultimately it fits the use I intend for the camera.  That is quick, on-the-fly interviews (with a tripod and an external mic) to upload to websites.  Plus, keep in mind these cameras are not intended for optimal video quality but instead for portability with a good picture and sound - that, the Zi8 does.  If you are going to nitpick the video then spend more on a real camcorder.I suggest looking at sample videos on [...] - watch video similar to what you would use the camera for; especially check out the mic test videos - they will impress you with the sound quality.Keep an eye out for the shakiness on samples videos.  If that is going to bother you then maybe wait for the next generation of the Zi8...I imagine with the negativity surrounding that problem, Kodak will hopefully address it with the next line.PROS:-

In learning abt other products in this class,many have internal memory of 8gb which is fine but a lot of moving to the hd if your limited for storage. By no means am i anywhere in the same world as a professional videographer,yet to my untrained eye this video of Brutus looks wonderful.

It can shoot in high definition 1080 progressive,720/60 frames a second,720/30 frs,wvga and still camera mode.  It also has a macro feature for close up shooting.  Overall the camera is easy to use and does quite well in standalone mode.  Add an external microphone for great sound and a tekkeon portable battery charger and you are set for any shooting time frame. It is light and fits easily in a bag or pocket.  It is great for field shooting. It has a usb connector for easy transfer to your computer. You need to get a sdhc high speed code 6 memory card. I am using an 8gb card. You might want to get a 16gb card if you plan to do a lot of heavy video shooting. It can take up to 32gb if you want to go that high.All in all it is a great camera and the pricing right now can't be beat.Kodak Zi8 Pocket Video Camera (Black)", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "\"Okay\" for pocket camcorder. Bad at low lighting, Shaky, Plays \"average\" on PS3", "Author": "IronChefSr", "ReviewID": "R3U9LCGZ1OQE2G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased to compliment my Nikon D60, and Powershot SD750.  Better video clarity than my powershot video feature, but no major improvements due to average image stabilizer which results on shaky recordings.  However, I would think that shaky videos are expected on any/all small pocket camcorders these days. Definitely NOT recommended for low lighting, image quality is bad indoor low-light, my SD750 does far better job.If you have PS3, you have to convert .MOV file to .MP4 format using Quicktime Pro. Playbacks were decent on my PS3. Also, .MOV file plays on Windows7 in media player by default, which is nice.PROS:- Fits in your pocket very well. I purchased blackberry holster from target for $10 and it fits like a glove.- Average video quality for quick pocket cam, just have to be very steady when shooting.- Battery life isn't that bad, so far.- 2.5\" screen is ideal for small pocket cam IMO.- SD card slot.- HDMI feature is nice touch, it plays okay on my computer/tv monitor with HDMI port.- USB cable is flexible, so it sort a works with laptops and desktop front port.CONS:- Image stabilizer does not work well, need to keep it very steady (however, does not ruin the experience, still good videos).- Toggle button on front is less to be desired. I have small hand, but it's still difficult to left/right/up/down.  I prefer individual buttons instead.- Buttons on front face is not as responsive as it should be, you don't feel like getting a confirmation feel when pushed, it has very hard feel, and could have made it tiny bit bigger.- No instructions or manual to improve your video experience. Though simple, you have to figure it all out on your own.- For the price, it should have included a least felt sleeve for protection.- 1080P is useless under low light.Overall, I would probably recommend this to my friends, but with caution over shakyness and bad low light recording capabilities.  I think it's idea for people who has entry DSLR and want video feature as an option in pocket.  I think it's ideal if you have the need for quick cam instances, like capturing kids.

One big attraction for me was the external microphone jack, as I wanted to use it for interviews.  I tried to order from Amazon.com but there was no stock, so I went to Best Buy.  The camera I got had a ridiculous number of flaws, indicating poor quality control at Kodak.  I had the problem of magenta & green vertical lines in the video images.  I had the problem of the sudden changes in exposure while zooming.  Meanwhile, I was noticing that the battery got very warm after just a couple minutes of shooting.  I wondered how it would fare if I tried to shoot an interview for 15 to 30 minutes.  I noticed that the battery drained quickly.  Then the speaker on the camera went out.  By that point I started to notice that the buttons & joystick were hard to operate -- and I have small hands.  Some of these problems have been reported by many other people on Amazon discussion groups.  So I returned this product to Best Buy for a full refund.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Im very pleased", "Author": "B. Denny", "ReviewID": "R37OKNXHQH4IU6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I just received my Zi8 today after buying it using the coupons listed in the Amazon.com forum. I was quite happy with the speed of the delivery and the ease of use as I ventured into my first ever camcorder of this size. Im used to the larger, bulkier pieces and I was drawn to this because of its size and the power with the 1080 recording. I did some testing with each setting to see which was best for my and my computer when I wanted to edit or publish some pieces. I was happy that all of them seemed to do well with capturing rich colors and fared well in low light ( at least better than I thought they would).I have noticed that the mic wasnt picking up alot of the sound but Ill get to that in a minute. I noticed what others on here have noticed about a high pitched tone coming from the camera. I have found that by turning up the sensitivity on the camera I have helped with both of my sound issues. I have started picking up more ambient sound around the subjects Im filming and the sound I heard (only when recording in 1080) has seemed to diminish drastically (probably under all of the other noises). Im very happy with the product and hope to continue finding uses for it. Ive only had it for 24 hours and will update this review as necessary. I hope this helps.Oh, I was also able to find some cheap SDHC cards and that made a huge difference. You just need to make sure its a good brand so that the transfer rate can support the 1080 recording rate.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best HD mini-camera I've ever had.", "Author": "Tyler Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1DI87YGWC7S7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After getting Kodak's earlier model of this camera, the zi6, All I can say is well done! I have always loved theportability of these little cameras, but the picture quality is now by far the biggest improvement. I have had many different mini-HD cameras, such as Creative's Vado, the Sony Webbie, and the \"Flip\". I can positively say that the zi8 takes the cake. Not only is the picture great, but the sound quality is the best I've heard from an internal mic.Although, for best quality, it would be wise to get a small wireless mic, which is great because you will have that option with this camera.-The camera comes with an AV/HDMI port. This is a good thing. I hooked up the camera very easily with the included HDMI cord, and the picture was to my surprise very clear and crisp. I find that shooting in 720p 60fps is the best. The video much more stable since I used the image stabilization feature, which does help.-Comes with a flexible usb plug for hooking into your computer. The software for uploading/editing is installed the first time you plug the camera into the computer. Also your camera can charge via the usb connection, which is also a plus in case you don't have your power cord around.-Also this camera takes decent photos. Not the greatest quality, but hey, its a video camera. Seems like the low light pictures are more grainy but high light pictures seemed decent enough. Definitely not as good as the digital cameras on the market, but nice if you need a picture in a snap.-high/low light video quality has improved since the zi6. This camera seems to do much better in low light, however there is still going to be some degrading. Video is much more clear and crisp since the zi6.-(sound issue) -- Some people have complained of hearing a high pitched ringing sound in the audio when playing back a video, I personally haven't experienced this, but I have found that some brands of headphones/speakers will create this high pitched sound, not the camera itself. If you do find that your camera has this issue, kodak has released a new firmware, which you download and install on the camera. It takes about half a minute to do and is very easy.-Zoom is decent, but the camera is by nature a bit \"zoomed in\" if you will. Its not as wide-angled as other cameras. If you experience any choppy zoom, update the firmware and the issue will disappear.-Takes SD cards, unlike the Sony Webbie. This is good because you have the choice to keep recording as long as you wish, your not tied down with a 120 minute recording limit. Just switch out SD cards and your ready to go. The camera doesn't come with a card, so it would be best to start out with 4GB and up. Shooting in 1080p mode takes up memory a lot quicker than the 720p mode so be prepared.-Comes with a regulation size tripod hole. I recommend getting a tripod if your going to be shooting more fast moving scenes, plus it just makes your videos look more professional and neat. I got my tripod at Walmart for around $17 and it works great.This is a wonderful little camera for the price. If your looking to shoot some good HD video but dont want to spend thousands on the more expensive HD cameras, then the zi8 in my opinion is your best bet. The software is easy to use, whether your editing or uploading to YouTube, you don't have to worry about needing a college degree to figure it out. very simple and easy to use. All around great camera for fun (and) serious video shooting.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "great w/ faults ....", "Author": "D. Wood", "ReviewID": "RY5JBFJ4Y3PW4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i had read (prior to purchase) that one individual had issues w/ the zoom function, in that, when zooming in, in either the 720/60 or the 720/30 modes, & i experienced the very same problem.  the picture would go dark about 1/2 way through the zoom & brighten upon the zoom out.  while this was not terribly noticeable outdoors in bright light, when indoors & low light conditions, i found it to be unbearable.kodak told me to contact the retailer for exchange/refund & amazon contacted me very quickly to report that lack of stock meant they could not replace the camera & would have to send me a refund.the camera is great for the size & very convenient in that respect.  the picture (w/out zoom) was great when viewed on my television through the hdmi out, or on the computer.i never experienced the high-pitched whine that some were complaining about, but the mono mic blows & an external upgrade would have been my next purchase.while i do feel the camera was a pretty good value, the press it has received blows it out of proportion.  by the time you by a 16gb sdhc class 4 memory card (in order to have \"enough\" space to cover you for a day of HD recording), another battery (if you intend to use the camera for more than 1-1.5 hours), & the inevitably necessary external mic; you have spent $300 or more, making it somewhat less a value.i hope this review helps you make the right decision in your purchase & i also hope that the problem w/ the zoom was a fluke & not a widespread issue.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "\"Defective\" unit - but still good", "Author": "M. Valenzuela", "ReviewID": "R29EAWJX3L96EA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Alright, I purchased this from Kodak directly and got a great deal on the price.  It has many great features.  Rated the camera as I received it, still hear about people who have the defect and some who don't, so not sure if it is a design flaw or really a defect.  More on the defect at the end.Features:Can take SD cards.  Currently using a 16GB card that runs great, even with 1080 recording.Easy to use.  Both a plus and minus.  I like how easy it is to operate, but I would like some more control over exposure.  The auto exposure was frustrating, especially with the face tracking turned on so I turned it off.  It would go from light to dark depending on the angle of the face and it would black out everything else.External mic option.  Great option if I want to get a boom mic type thing for recording kids games.Tripod mount.  Got a mini tripod and it works great.Image stabilization.  Worked great for me.  My hands can stay pretty still, even when I'm moving so I didn't notice any jitter or jaggy lines.Connectors.  HDMI port is great to connect to HDTV.  Built in USB is great, used a USB extender cable like other reviewer since my USB ports are not by the floor or desk and don't want to hang the camera in mid air.  Would have loved if the camera had an option to act as a webcam, or that the camera could record while connected via usb to a computer.  Being able to store video on the computer hard drive or just as an unending power supply would be great.  Maybe a firmware fix can add this?Video Quality.  In good light, outdoors, the camera records great video on all settings.  HD looks amazing on an HDTV.  As you go into bad light, or at night, or indoors, the quality starts to degrade.  You notice color noise and the auto exposure starts to kick in to help but it is too unpredictable with face tracking on.Battery.  Not great.  The camera is fairly big, and the battery is really thin and about half the size of a business card.  They could have easily fit a battery twice the size in this.  As it is, the battery doesn't last that long, maybe an hour.  Get an external battery pack if you want to record, without changing batteries, for longer.Zoom.  Not great.  Digital zoom would have been better if it was smooth.  And any zoomed video was lower quality.  Obvious I know, but was hoping for more.  Wouldn't use it as it is.Video format.  Not great.  The movies played fine on my computer, but my software to convert videos doesn't read .mov files.  Why they would pick a mac format for a device that has software that doesn't work well on a mac is beyond me.  Would have been great if they used a standard format like AVI.  Needed to buy more software to convert the format in to something usable.Software.  Not great.  See above about format.  The software is a stripped down version and only lets you convert the movie or movies into a few types, non of which are usable by my software.  Only for converting to apple formats, playstation formats, or web formats.  It is really easy to use to edit and cut clips together and make movies and can even make dvds.  But it will only record dvds to a disc not the hard drive which would have helped.And now the deal breaker.  I could have dealt with, or worked around all the above, but I got one of the units that has a very loud high pitched whine when using the internal mic.  It was present on all recording modes, except photo.  It is more obvious playing back on the camera, it lessens when played on the computer but is still there.  Lowering the mic sensitivity to the lowest setting makes it almost go away, but then you lose people's voices if they aren't very close to the camera.  Using an external mic eliminates the whine, but my primary use for the camera is with the internal mic.I called Kodak and I'm within the 30 day return window so I am sending mine in for a replacement, which they assured me would be a new unit.  I have to pay shipping back to them, but I got free shipping before so I'm not too bummed about that.For what I need, this camera is near perfect.  When the new camera comes in I can update the review.  Also thinking about getting the external mic and power supply mentioned in another of these reviews as I want to record the kids games and think they would help out.As for the stars.  I would have rated it four stars if it wasn't for the defect, assuming it's a defect.  Without the whine, if the camera had any three of these: better low light control, better battery, better zoom, better software, different format; I would have rated it five stars.  It's still a nice camera and I will be happy with it if I can get one without the whine.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price", "Author": "Clowerweb", "ReviewID": "R2B88ESQEJH3WH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a two part video review of this camera (and compared it to the Flip Ultra HD), which is available on YouTube. They were too big to upload here, so I'll give you the links:[...]The good: - Great picture quality under adequate lighting - Up to 32 GB SDHC expansion - External microphone jack - Multiple recording modes (1080p @ 30, 720p @ 60, 720p @ 30, WVGA) - Ability to capture 5 MP still images - Macro mode for nice quality close-ups - Comes with HDMI and A/V output cables included - Third party spare/replacement batteries are very inexpensive - Works well even in 1080p mode with a 2 year old generic 16 GB class 4 SDHC card - Included wall charger is convenient if you don't always have a PC available on trips - Large, bright, vibrant screen - Standard tripod mount - Very thin and sleek looking - Light weight, and small enough to fit nicely in even a shirt pocket - Kodak seems to stay on top of keeping firmware updated to correct issues - Camera is very easy to use and user friendly - Included software is easy to use and has more features than most included software with cameras - Ability to use a remote to control most of the camera's functions (not included)The bad: - Built-in microphone sound quality is not great (best with external mic) - The same poor low light picture quality that seems to plague all these pocket camcorders - No optical zoom, digital zoom, as with any camera, is worthless - Image stabilization (EIS) uses a lot of battery life and could perform better - 1080p mode comes with the sacrifice of the wide angle you get in 720p mode - Virtually no built-in memory, you will need to invest in an SDHC card - Battery life is decent, but not great (about an hour and 15 minutes with EIS off) - No flash for still photos, not a digital still cam replacement, especially in low light - Rounded bottom, will not stand up without a tripod or propping up on something - 1080p mode can appear more shaky than 720p mode, I recommend only using 1080p with a tripod - Remote is sold separatelyWeighing the good with the bad, I still gave this camera 5 stars because I have to say that overall the Zi8 is fantastic for the price. Many of the bad points are either minor, or common with most or all camcorders of this class. I also own a 3rd generation Flip Ultra HD (8 GB, 720p @ 60 fps), and in picture quality there is no comparison - the clarity, color accuracy and white balance are hands down far superior with the Zi8. The sound quality on the built-in microphone leaves a lot to be desired though, and is about the only thing the Flip has over the Zi8, but the Zi8's external microphone capability more than makes up for it. I picked this one up for $114 new, and even after buying the remote ($10), a mini tripod ($10 w/ shipping), and two spare batteries ($7 - generic, but they work great), I got all of it combined for less than the average price for the Flip Ultra HD.If you are going to be using this camera in situations where you will need a good zoom, this camera is not for you, nor is any pocket camcorder. The only one with an optical zoom, that I know of at the time of this writing, is the Samsung, which I almost bought until I read the reviews here and on cnet and YouTube. If you're considering the Samsung for the zoom feature, skip it and skip all pocket camcorders for that matter.Likewise for low light. None of these cameras do well in low light. If the picture isn't completely black, it will be extremely noisy (image, not sound) with lots of fractals. Plan on bringing your own external light source if you think you're going to need it in low light.Even with all these bad points, there isn't much to complain about with this camera. It has the most features and best picture quality of any camcorder in the HD pocket cam market, hands down. For a grab and go, point and shoot camcorder that's well under $200 and provides HD quality, you can't beat it. It's also great for vlogging on YouTube and Facebook, or doing video reviews of products with nice macro closeups. For the convenience and price you can't go wrong, but you also can't expect it to compete with it's much bulkier and more expensive counterparts.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sample footage of the incredible Zi8", "Author": "A.

Be sure to upgrade the firmware. Mine was a little flaky till I upgraded to 1.06 (it came with 1.03).Pros:+ Cost. It is amazing what you get for the price.+ Size. It is about the size of a big smartphone, so it is pocketable.+ It comes with all the cables you could want for it (HDMI output, composite output, etc).+ It has a macro mode which is very useful for when you need to get close to things. Just be sure to turn macro mode off when you aren't using it as the camera will not focus on distant objects any more when in macro mode.+ Uses SD cards for memory so you can carry more than one and upgrade the capacity as SD cards continue to get bigger and cheaper+ The controls are great. I love the joystick you press to start/stop recording and playback. It is easy enough to hit when you mean to yet you won't hit it by accident, either.+ Mass storage device compliant. Meaning you don't actually need to install any drivers for the camera and can just copy the files off like you would any other disk.+ The video editing software is on the device. If you are away from home you can easily install the software on the other person's computer to edit and convert your videos without having to download anything.+ The included software is decent enough for free. It offers enough capabilities for making Youtube or PSP videos without buying anything else.Cons:- I would rather it have a standard mini-USB port on it instead of the fold out USB plug. I know this is supposed to be a feature and they copied it from the Flip (and then improved it by making it flexible rather than rigid), but I don't care for it. It's not a big deal for me to have a USB to miniUSB cable around since everything uses it from my digital camera, to my blackberry, to my harmony remote control, to my GPS.- The simple and limited menus do make this very easy to use for novices, but they are somewhat limiting for more advanced users.- No live playback to external video monitor during recording. When you hook up the device to an external monitor it automatically goes into playback mode.- MOV file format. I'm not sure why everybody feels the need to use a proprietary Apple format for video, but that seems to be the case. I resent having to convert all my videos (and install Quicktime just do be able to do that), but since every other device manufacturer seems to do the same thing, I can't be too harsh on Kodak for going along.As you can see from the cons there's some room for improvement, but given the price and the competition I don't see a reason to give it any less than 5 stars.", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Combo (Video/Photo) \"Shirt Pocketable\" Camcorder So Far", "Author": "Mark \"wingmark\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y0LLW0O9KH9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camcorder (back-ordered) finally arrived last week and I noticed that the box seal had been broken and re-taped.  It appears someone opened the box and updated the camera firmware to 1.03, which solves some of the problems others have reported.  I had already heard about the latest firmware release (free download) and had planned to upgrade this myself, but Kodak resellers might be doing it on their own to avoid complaints.  I am an early adopter who has had many small camcorders, from palm-sized to shirt pocket-sized.  I have handled the previous model, the Zi6, though I always thought it seemed too bulky, like the Flips.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the more compact size of the Zi8. The biggest problems with pocket camcorders has always been lousy optical performance in low light (with lousy stills) and scratchy audio. The latest generation of pocket cams has largely remedied this, but no shirt pocketable device I've seen to-date has the performance of the Zi8, combined with iPod-like simplicity.  It is also the only Pocket cam that serves as a decent combo device (photos and video). With other pocket cams you are limited to poor quality video captures, whereas Kodak lets you snap decent resolution photos that come out fine even in low light (expect the competition to catch onto this).  This pocket camcorder is no substitute for a good digital camera, or even an ordinary full-size camcorder, but it does the job when you either don't have, or don't want to take your bulkier devices with you.  It is also so simple to use that it is good for kids 8 and up (in my opinion).  It turns on instantly and immediately displays your video recording or snapshot options, so that you can quickly know (or toggle to) the setting you want to use. Some of the features the Zi8 has that the competition lacks include the external microphone input, digital image stabilization, and an SD card slot for unlimited recording. It is also important to note that the Zi8 is the only shirt-pocketable camcorder to-date with any type of image stabilization, so kudos to Kodak for at least trying, even though the feature is weak. The biggest plus for me, personally, was the 5 MP widescreen still camera, which is exclusive to Kodak. Photos taken indoors in low light are actually passable, not the usual yellow blurry mess. You won't be impressed with the digital zoom or jumpy videos if you don't keep the camera very still, but I guarantee that every pocket camera (at least the shirt pocket variety) will be like that.  Until the competition catches up, this is the best truly \"shirt pocketable\" camcorder on the market in any price range.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Trial of the telephoto zoom", "Author": "G.

First, as to the high pitched whine that others have noticed, I have not noticed this with my Zi8, and I've tested the camera in a quiet environment. It might be a problem present in only some units. Second, the 1080p setting produces very noticeable jumping or stuttering of the image with any kind of movement of the camera or subject. This is unacceptable. I have tested every recording mode and have found that the best results are achieved with the 720p/60 setting. I viewed my test videos on a 40 inch 1080p TV, and was surprised to see that videos made with 720/60 were actually sharper and contained less noise than those made in 1080p/30. It's also worth noting that videos made in any setting other than 1080p have a wider view or focal length, actually the same as the view width of the Zi6. The Zi8's 1080p mode, on the other hand, has a narrower view or longer effective focal length...not by a whole lot, but noticeable. Since I will be shooting everything at 720/60 with this camera, I tried setting the camera to 720/60 and notched up the digital zoom just enough so that it was the same as the focal length of the 1080p mode, then shot the identical subject and was surprised and pleased to find that even moderately zoomed, the 720/60 mode gave sharper and overall better results than the 1080p mode. As for the 5mp still images, they're okay but nothing to write home about. An inexpensive 5mp still camera would do much better, obviously at least because of the Zi8's incredibly tiny fixed focus lens. I give the Zi8 three stars because it's disappointing but usable, and a step up from the Zi6. Kodak is on the right track, but a lot more work needs to be done.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Superman", "ReviewID": "R2RHSZPKNXQKTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people complain about everything.  This is a great pocket camcorder....if you know why you're buying.If you plan to shoot professionally, you should probably get a new profession.  If you plan to shoot all indoor at night, look elsewhere.If you're like most and video your kids at the park or on family vacations or birthday parties or any similar use, this works perfectly.  Easy for my wife to keep in her purse and pull out whenever my son does something cute.  Way better than video from most point and shoots, and far easier than lugging a traditional camcorder (even the smallest of the new breed).  Its fairly inconspicuous....looks like you're using a cell phone (for those of you who don't want to look like your dad shooting video in the 80s).I chose the Zi8 over the Flip because of video quality, removable battery and I can use SD cards.Video and pictures are bright and clear and smooth (I use 720p/60fps).Sound is ok.  You can add a small external mic, like those you plug into a laptop....very cheap.Yes, there is shake when you walk with the camera, but nothing I'm not used to from the other (larger) camcorders I've used in the past 10 years.  Don't plan to run and shoot.  But panning is very smooth, especially on 720p/60fps.  If you're fairly steady, you won't have a problem (don't give it to grandpa).I use this with an 8gb Transcend sdhc, class 6.  Works great.  8gb gives little over an hour on 1080p or 720p/60fps....about 1hr 20min on 720p/30fps .... and over 2hrs on wvga.  I have a second 8gb....better to have 2 8gb cards than 1 16gb card, in case of card error.Camera takes pretty good stills....all in widescreen format.  I disagree with others who say this is cellphone quality....its much better.Zoom is smooth, if you have the latest firmware.  But zooming all the way makes it less stable, even if standing still.Hooked this up to my samsung 50in plasma.  Video looks great and smooth...not sure why some have complained of graininess.  Stills look great too (oddly, the pics look better on the hdtv than on my computer).  Easy to navigate the files from the camcorder.  HDMI cable is included.Overall, very good product, considering the price and why I am using it....and Amazon threw in a free extra battery.Amazon service was great, as usual.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best HD Pocket Cam? Yes, But Interface & Technical Glitches = Needs Perfecting!", "Author": "Matt Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1GRFXIL5YJMLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "== Kodak Zi8 ==PROS:VIDEO OF MOTION: After hours of research, I decided the Kodak IS in fact the better pick over Flip, and my experience proved this correct, I believe.  The reason is simple: the Zi8 allows you to shoot higher quality video, and better quality video of things in MOTION (on the 720p/60fps setting).  I've noticed that when moving the camera from right to left, even slowly, on a regular 720p setting--like the Flip HD cameras use all the time--you get slightly shakey, pixelated video.  The Zi8 eliminates most of this problem by offering the additional 60fps (frames per second) setting, which allows you to pan around, up and down, left and right, and NOT worry about shakey, pixelated video.GENERAL VIDEO QUALITY: The Zi8 allows for a higher quality setting at 1080p which is, true to its word, a very high quality-looking video, though slightly more cropped at this setting.  Video quality at the high settings lives up to its pixel ratings--it's excellent, especially for so small a camera.EASE OF USE: Controls on the Zi8 are fairly intuitive (with some cons, below), and the camera is easy to get the hang of quickly.  I wouldn't be deterred by comments that this is the more \"technical\" camera; I think anyone can learn the Zi8 fairly easily.  All you need to know is the difference between 1080, 720/60, and 720--the important settings you'll want to manipulate occasionally depending on what you're videoing.CONS:USER INTERFACE: I think the Zi8 is the best we have in technology so far, but it's not quite there yet.  What would make this a perfect camera?  Frankly, if Canon made it.  Then perhaps the user interface--which is a bit awkward, especially in reviewing and deleting videos--would be up to par.  I find it difficult to delete one video without the Zi8 immediately asking me if I'd like to delete the next.  And if you've reviewed part of a video and paused it, the delete button will cycle you immediately back to the very first screen.  I'm caught off gaurd by this, and find the delete feature ever so slightly risky--beware of deleting the wrong video!  It's also generally difficult, I find, to scroll through videos you've taken; you must push a button to cycle your current video back to its beginning in order to see the next or previous video--this seems minor but believe me, it gets annoying and a bit confusing (even for someone good with gadgets).CONTROL OVER SETTINGS: I would have liked more control over the settings, which offer very few options outside of brightening/dimming the screen and turning on or off the image stabilization and face tracking.  Nonetheless, the controls are easy to get the hang of, although lacking in what you can actually \"hang of\" in manipulating settings.DEFECTIVE MODEL: Perhaps most distressing about the camera is that the model I first received froze several times, rectified only by taking the battery out and putting it back in.  Not good!  Also, I noticed that a couple of my very short video clips were corrupted and unreadable--even MORE not good!  I ultimately ended up replacing the model I was sent, and the replacement seems fine.  But something to be weary of.USB/RUBBER EXTENSIONS: One more thing--the rubber gizmos that extend from the Zi8 are a bit flimsy, and I worry that with enough use, the USB interface or the cover to the SD card slot will break off.  It's a good quality camera overall, but the extensions seemed to have missed the quality-boat.STICKER: On the most picky note, the Kodak executives who decided a GIANT GOOFY STICKER should be stuck to the front of the device that blazons \"YouTube!!\" and \"HD!!\" should be wrapped in a similarly foolish and juvenile sticker that says \"FIRED!\" and then, well...fired.  That sticker sets the price of the camera back $50 in aesthetic value.  Remove it at once, and see what the camera OUGHT to look like!BOTTOM LINE:This is the best HD pocket camera that exists today, but it's not perfected.  The user interface is a little sloppy in places (Canon--master of the user interface--should take over its redesign!), and my own model had some minor issues with freezing and corrupting video several times (I replaced it for another that works fine).  But the Zi8 takes higher quality video than Flip, and it's easy enough to use--all in all a cool camera that shoots great video for the price and size, although it's still very much a \"first generation\" device.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "The quick video camera", "Author": "M.

If you do you're going to set yourself up for disappointment. The Kodak Zi8 is a good camera for 179.00 and the picture quality is great. I would suggest to shoot things in the 720p 60fps picture. It's very easy to use and is very simple. I call it \"The Quick Video Camera\" because that's what it is. A quick camera that is small enough to put in your pocket and quick enough to grab and start shooting. This camera does beats out a lot of the other video cams below 3k dollars.

Aponte", "ReviewID": "R2IOH7W5QHYD9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my zi8 a week before Christmas and have been using it almost every day. I absolutely love it and the reasons are: price, portability, ease of use, expandable memory, and nice design.  The camera is probably the easiest device to use that I've ever owned. You install the battery, SDHC card, turn on power, and press the record button. It's that simple. The menu for adjusting video modes (1080, 720, 640, etc) and other features are just as easy to use.I can't really understand some of the reviews here that talk about poor image quality, terrible Image Stabilization, zoom feature darkens video, etc.  These reviews make no sense to me. You paid under $200 for this camera and it does exactly what it's supposed to do!  Now, if you paid over $600 for a camera then I can understand the complaints about image quality, IS, etc.  The videos I shot over the Christmas holiday came out exactly as I anticipated. They were all shot with limited lighting so the quality wasn't superb but they were definitely acceptable.  The shakiness in some of the video was expected since I shot all of my videos handheld. If you don't have an EXTREMELY steady hand you will not produce perfect video as if you were using a tripod. The EIS feature helps but doesn't produce tripod mounted video. Just use common sense and think about it. You are trying to hold a device perfectly steady that weighs under 4 ounces. It is almost impossible to not shake!! If you plan on shooting handheld and don't want ANY \"hand shake\" in your videos then don't buy this camera. Invest in a bulkier/heavier camera that will add weight and decrease shake.  Some of the reviewers have too high expectations for this little camera. Leave the high expectations for the higher end cameras and don't believe all of the hype you read in the marketing literature for this cheap little device. I will agree though that the battery life is awful. Knowing this ahead of time, I bought an extra battery and was able to shoot about 2.5-3 hours of video during Christmas. Also note that image stabilization sucks battery power, so if you can shoot from a tripod you will get more battery life. I shot the entire Christmas event with EIS turned on so battery life wasn't great.The software is not excellent but it gets the job done. Again, like the camera, it is very simple and easy to use. I had no issues with it at all. I was able to combine my videos into 10 minute \"movies\" and then used a free video compression utility (handbrake) to compress the video, while maintaining the quality, for uploading to my smugmug account.The reality is, this camera is a perfect \"carry around\" camera that produces acceptable and sometimes exceptional video at a very low cost.  It is NOT for the purpose of creating professional video, although some claim they are able to and I don't doubt them. I can't wait to take this thing on vacation with me so I don't have to drag around my bulkier hard drive based camcorder, especially walking around in amusement parks!BOTTOM LINE - 4 stars (8 out of 10) and I love it for what it does!PROS - price is right, good quality video sometimes exceptional (depends on lighting), excellent design, portability, expandable memory (allows you to carry multiple cards instead of having to delete or transfer video before using it again)CONS - battery life is poor, no SD card included (should have came with a 4GB SD card at a minimum), software is just ok", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not ready for 32gb YET", "Author": "G.

The video quality in good light is excellent.  It's really easy to use.  In under 15 seconds, I can be shooting away.  The battery will run out faster than an 8gig memory card, even on 1080 resolution- so consider a spare battery if you are on a trip.There are two drawbacks that make me hesitant to recommend this product.  First off, the lens has no wide-angle capability.  I find myself always having to back-up to try to get a \"medium\" shot.  With a minimum focus of about 3 feet, you can't shoot people or things in close quarters.  There is a macro function but unless you are an entomologist, it is not very helpful.The lack of a wide angle lens compounds the second problem which is the lack of a good image stabilizer.  Unless you are holding the unit rock-solid, the image gets blurry very easily.  And without a wide-angle lens, you are forced to constantly follow objects that move or they will move out of the tight frame line.I would suggest going to Best Buy to test this camera and its competitors before you come back to Amazon to get the cheapest price.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak's Zi8 in a word:  OUTSTANDING... buy it!!", "Author": "Stormy Weather", "ReviewID": "RL43DXPZ119CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Zi8 through Amazon 10 days ago (overthe flip ultra hd) and absolutely LOVE it.The quality and convenience factor is so high, it's replacedboth my $900.00 Canon HD Camcorder, and my old flip video cam.Here's what I like about the Zi8:#1:  External Mic Jack -- YES!!!

I also bought the Zi8 sleeve for $20 and an sdhc 16 gb card for $40.  Amazon did a great job packaging and sending the items, but that's where the excitement ended.  After charging the battery and doing the initial tasks, I checked the Info portion on the menu and it did indeed reflect the 1.06 firmware.  Low and behold, I still had major problems.  The zoom-in functionality on the 720 and 720/60 settings created an intense darkening of the screen as well as on the resulting image on playback on camera as well as on the computer.  And then the graininess . . . major graininess with 'low light' which was actually just normal indoor lighting.  After researching all these issues intensely through amazon and other reputable electronic sites, these same issues were supposedly corrected with the 1.06 firmware upgrade . . but for whatever reason, my camera didn't seem to take to the update.  So then I tried to reload the 1.06 according to the instructions on Kodak's website, but my computer couldn't detect my sdhc card and I would have to spend more money on getting a pc card adapter.  Didn't want to spend more money on something that was supposed to already be fixed.  I then contacted Kodak online customer service (at 5am CST which was the only time anyone ever responded, and earlier in the day that portion of the Kodak website was down mysteriously) who was very nice, but after I had to assure him that I did not dump sand or water on the product, he almost too readily asked me to send my item to their repair services.  After reading numerous entries about what a nightmare that was in terms of out-of-pocket expense, time and essentially not getting the issue fixed, I declined.  I then asked him if there was a way to download the firmware directly through the usb port on the camera.  Of course, the answer was no.I really wanted to like the product; I wasn't expecting miracles with a $180 pricetag, but I wanted the thing to work and for the firmware to do its job. Or at least not have to spend more just to fix an issue that should already be fixed.  Here's a more clear breakdown based on my experience:Pros:-great design-large lcd-ease of use-lightweight-good enough internal mic for me-HD capability-great casual, fun camera for quick videoCons:-doesn't stand on its own; I would suggest that kodak include a tiny, detachable stand (and retain the rounded bottom!)-additional expense: $20 on sleeve, and found only ONE option; $40 for 16gb card-firmware update is a pain! even if your cam comes with the 1.06, make sure that it rectifies the issues!  and if you need to reload the firmware, be sure that your computer can detect your card, or you might have to spend more money on card reader.Misc.-Kodak should change the plastic shell to more of a grip material like the Flip-Add a protective lens cover-Allow for the 1.06 firmware to be downloaded directly to the camera via its USB instead of through the memory card-Concentrate on customer service and consistency of quality on the zi8!!!  It takes up to 72(!)hours for user commment approval on their website, and they can't take the time to make sure they make q/a on their products more stringent?!There's much more that I can't think of right now, but I would like to emphasize that I am not an advanced techie and that some of the issues I bring up may be par for the course.  I still think its well worth the, essentially, $240 pricetag and better than the Flip . . . IFF yours works of course.  I understand that the 1.06 issue could be specific to the camera I happened to receive, but I will not be exchanging mine for another one, this 33 yr old can't take the stress of another potentially disappointing kodak kurplunk. I am thinking of getting the Canon fs200.  I heard that for a canon, its not the best video quality, but its within my price range and I really hope that it is superior to zi8.

The bundled Arcsoft software installs when connecting the Zi8 to the PC and has basic editing capabilities.And, Thankfully I did not experience the high pitch whine that some reviewers heard. When playing back videos in max volume on the PC I do hear some slight whine, but it's barely noticeable. The Audio recording is clear when the subject is within 15 feet. An external mic would be great, but I did not buy this to lug another mic around.The low light recording is not good and that was expected. Even high-end camcorders are bad in this area.This is a camcorder you can whip up from your camera bag or purse or jacket pocket or wherever you carry yours, shoot a quick video for a few mins, and be on your way without fiddling with a lot of controls.Electronic image stabilization works, but barely. There's noticeable shake when shooting while walking and that's because the camera is the size of a cellphone making it hard to hold and keep steady. It takes a little while to figure out how to hold it and make the vidos look smooth. Personally, my video shakes were caused by the replay of the muscle memory of countless tremors from many years back. The videos are more stable shot with my left hand!4X Zoom works, but it's not smooth. It moves in and out like a Kangaroo. Not a fan of this feature.Have not measured battery usage, but I think it winds down in under an hour. It's better to buy a second battery. I bought one from Kodak for $30. Recommend it when traveling.Bought the Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory from Amazon and it can store 2+ hours of 1080p or 4+ hours of lesser defintion video.Taking still pictures with this is not recommended. The 5 MP images are better than cell phone pics, but still mediocre.You can use Quicktime or the bundled Arcsoft to watch videos. Watching the .mov files on VLC or Realplayer makes the video pause and jerk around.Connecting to the computer is a breeze. You can use the built-in usb connector or pop out the SD card and use a card reader if you have one.So four stars for me - I take a star off for bad still pictures and not so good image stabilization.

After a week, the camera stopped working.  I called Kodak customer service who tried to troubleshoot the issue as they should.  FAter that didn't work, I was given a case ID and instructions to send it in for repair under warranty.  Several weeks later i received a refurbished unit with a note stating they decided to replace rather than repair.  Several weeks later i tried to use the camera, it would not work.  i thought it might be the memory card, so I bought another one.  Same thing--camera would not record, and would not turn off unless battery was removed.  Once again went through the customer service routine, returned the unit. After 6 weeks I received a notice saying a replacement will be sent in \"15-20 days\".  I called the number listed with my reference number, and now have been told this model is out of stock and there is no timetable when it will be available.  I asked to speak with a manager, who apologetically confirmed the issue.  As an aside, I had to pay the postage for both returns, needlessly purchased an extra memory card, wasted time on hold, making calls, etc.  4 months, no camera.  Kodak should be ashamed of the quality and what has happened to this once great brand.  The plus is that the customer service was adequate, normal hold times, and was able to speak to a human and the manager came on pretty quickly.

Obviously I chose the zi8.. and after owning it for a little over a month, I give it a very solid five stars.  ---First of all, I noticed reviewers had problems with this camera that are in fact, not the camera, It is the user. This is an EASY TO USE CAMERA!Why I chose this camera was the ability to shoot 1080p and 720@ 60 frames/second (amazing video quality!) and I like having the option to switch out sd cards, unlike flips which have only 8gb and cannot do 60fps (I do most of my shooting in this)  I am very happy with this purchase, the 1.06 firmware fixes the wine in the audio, and the sketchy zoom. I have had no problems.The video quality is outstanding! Image Stabilization is great!I used this at a Dallas Stars hockey game and got great video.. you can keep track of the puck in the video, It is SO clear.-----I received the camera expecting the internal mic to be horrible... IT IS PERFECTLY FINE. The option of an external mic is great, but I will most likely not be using it.Other Pros--- The screen is bright and clear, Video is smooth, functions are EASY, built in USB is amazing, macro (close up) mode is great and quick to switch to, 1080p @30fps, 720p@60fps, The ability to take still pictures, ---Some may consider a con, but I love ion batteries.. off brand ones are cheap and work fine. (I hate buying and maybe losing AA). Fast startup time, overall great camcorder.Cons- low light is not the best, Still picture quality not great either but that is expected.. most pocket cams dont even offer still picture taking ability.Other Note-Get a class 6 sd card!  Amazon shipped for free, it arrived a day early, and no tax, I love amazon! I have a mac so I don't use the software.. I also bought it here on amazon when it was at the price for $149. It might go down again but I would definitely  buy it at the price of 179 though! I got a gorilla pod and it works great, check it out!!Bottem line---- This has been a great pocket camcorder, its small and takes amazing video. I think this beats out any in its class.

It is easy to use (absolutely idiot proof) and creates good quality video.  The picture is a little grainy in low light, but no different than the full size model I used before.  I was concerned about the stability of the picture after reading several reviews, but that proved to be no problem.  I recorded my childrens' piano recitals by literally holding the camera out in the aisle around the heads in front of me.  The resulting video looked like it had been taken on a tripod, and I\"m not a particularly steady handed person.  The real sell was the expandability.  I bought a 16 GB Class 6 card and it works GREAT.  I was told you could use a 32 GB - but someone said it didn't work as well?I had read that transferring video to I-Movie on a Mac could be challenging, and sure enough, when I connected the camera via USB cable, I-Photo popped up instead of I-Movie.  Because I'm not technically savvy, I transferred it this way:  Closed I-Photo, opened the \"no name\" USB connection showing on the desktop.  I dragged the movies to my desktop where they copied automatically.  Then I opened I-Movie and selected import videos, from Desktop.  Piece of cake!  A little extra step that amounted to about an extra 2 min.Connecting to TVs at home was easy, and uploading to Youtube a breeze.  I LOVE this camera!!  I purchased it in hopes that the portability (I keep it in my purse) would motivate me to take more video of my kids. (I have 25 hours of their first Christmas, and about 45 min of the rest of their lives, lol!)  I've been able to pull it out several times and get cute shots of the kids at activities, with their friends, etc.  It's not too heavy to take on a climb to the Great Wall of China (left my old camera behind on our adoption trip - too heavy) and it's small enough for a fanny pack at a ballgame or while hiking.

BUT I CAN'T.I've spent the last week for hours each day researching similar cameras and have no doubt this one is the best in its class. Better video, better contrast. Better sound with built in mic. Expandable to external mic. Etc.  The online reviews & especially video & sound comparisons on the web really show that Kodak blows away the competition.  That is IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON USING WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER! Because if you are, you aren't going to get far with this camera due to the .MOV format only which is NOT compatible with Movie Maker nor Windows DVD software. I've also tried other movie programs for Windows, three others...they either cost lots of money or just don't stack up the convenience & power of Movie Maker.Many cameras are coming with only the video output as .MOV format which is a QuickTime Mac format. While MOV is great quality, I find this a huge disservice to Windows users.  Is it just Mac people that want to edit video? Yes its possible to watch these movies on a Windows computer with a quick & free install of QuickTime from Apple, but FORGET editing it. Can't be done without converting the .MOV files to a Windows equivalent such as WMV or AVI. Sure you can convert the files using aftermarket software, but trust me from countless hours of experience: converting these files is a MAJOR hassle, they don't always work, and when they do there is always a slightly lesser quality result.Granted, if you are just a weekend warrior who wants to make some quick videos, burn some DVDs, upload some simply YouTube vids, then you might not mind the hassle in Windows of converting these files once you find the software that works. And once you've decided to accept a slightly lesser quality of video post-conversion. The converted files are actually decent quality, but if you are looking for great quality with no loss in appearance & audio, you WILL be disappointed.i've tried about four diff't conversion programs and each time the converted video is not as good as the native .MOV format in appearance or sound. Think of it as looking at something in a display case that you will never be able to buy. you can look at it, watch it, but you won't be able to really USE it in Windows to burn DVDs or with the ever popular Movie Maker.To be fair I rated the camera 4 stars as I know its a good product. But I write this review to warn other unwary buyers:  buyer beware, if you are planning on doing fairly in-depth video editing on a Windows machine with Movie Maker, look elsewhere for a camera that records in AVI (like the Toshiba Camileo...probably not as good of a camera but has other neat features like a light, massive swivel screen, slow-motion, AND records in usable files for Windows out of the box).Thanks for reading hope this was a help to some Windows users.UPDATED 04/16/11 ...................... I did end up buying the Zi8 a couple weeks ago and am pretty happy with it. There is a bit of a workaround to the .MOV issue: out of all the programs I've found Quick Time Pro does the best job at file conversion, this makes sense since .MOV is built in Quick Time to being with. This is roughly a $23 upgrade from the free version.  However the best option I've found is just use a video editing program that can handle native .MOV files, that way there is no loss of quality because you don't need to convert anything. Currently I am running Power Director 9 trial version & like it enough to buy it, it does crash often requiring a restart of the software (not the system) on my computer which is just slightly underpowered for this software but I can still get through it and produce good end product via the Kodak Zi8. I did some tests with the external mic vs. the onboard mic, & even with a cheap Logitech clip-on $15 mic the sound quality is worlds better. Therefore that's the big selling point of this camera, especially if you want it to film vids of yourself, get an external mic & you'll have one powerful HD recording setup.ANOTHER UPDATE 4/20/13Still liking my camera, but found an annoying flaw today. This thing excels and I mean excels at super-close up video (less than 8 inches away) Its pretty good at distant video, like a concert, outdoor activities, indoor birthday party, etc.  But get within the 2-4 foot range and it lacks clear focus.

But for well under $200.00 this camera is amazing!", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "You want a real review?", "Author": "username_5", "ReviewID": "R1LETDQ6XCFBL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using camcorders in a nonprofessional capacity for a couple decades.  Currently my 2 camcorders are a Canon HF200 (please do not buy this because as of this date all sellers including Amazon are asking it's original retail price for a 2009 model when the 2010 model is half the price.)What I will be doing is comparing the Kodak Zi8 which I bought on closeout elsewhere for $70 with the Canon HF200 which I bought for around $700 new a couple years ago.You might think this a really unfair comparison, but I think it very fair and here is why:1.  The Canon is a year older than the Zi8 (or same year depending how you count these things)2.  They both shoot 1080p at 30 frames per second3.  They both claim to have image stabilization.4.  Many purchasers of 'pocket' camcorders do not wish to sacrifice performance, they simply want the ultra portability of the size factor. I think this is a point missed by all the manufacturers of pocket sized camcorders who routinely sacrifice performance in the interest of size/cost.Let's start with audio:-  The internal mic is pretty good on both.  By pretty good I do not mean it records pro quality audio on either.  For that you need an external mic and this is one area the Zi8 sets itself apart from it's pocket sized competition.  I suspect the makers of these small and relatively inexpensive devices think purchasers really do not care about audio quality.  I think they are wrong.  The sound quality of the Zi8 internal mic is quite good (don't worry about earlier reviews saying it was terrible, this was a firmware issue now corrected), but it simply won't produce crystal clear audio for any kind of video work when compared to an external lav mic for interviews or a shotgun mic for interviews or more distant sound sources while filtering out unwanted ambient noise (such as wind).  In this area I actually have to give the Zi8 the nod over the much more expensive Canon HF200.  In outdoor conditions the Canon seems to pick up every little blowing of the wind.  The Zi8 seems to avoid this pretty well while still picking up voices 20' away.  Not loud or with pro quality sound mind you, but intelligible.  Bottom line:audio quality on both when indoors is equal, outdoors the Canon picks up hideous amounts of wind noise while the Zi8 seems to filter it out much better.  With an external mic they are equal, but using the internal mic the Zi8 at the $70 I paid for it is better than the Canon at 10x the price.Now, the video:-  Simply put the more expensive Canon beats the snot out of the Zi8 in this regard.  If both camcorders are placed on a tripod and exposed to generously lighted situations they are probably comparable to most eyes.  Where the Canon really shows it's superiority to the Zi8 and really all pocket sized camcorders is when panning or trying to capture anything even resembling fast motion (such as a child kicking his/her feet).  The Zi8 will produce a noticeable blur in the motion while the Canon will not.  Both are supposedly recording at 1080p/30fps, but there is a sharp distinction when it comes to panning or simply recording fast moving subjects.- Image stabilization:  These days IS is a buzz phrase, but what it actually accomplishes ranges from nothing to astonishing.  For the Canon, it's close to astonishing and for the Zi8 it's close to nothing.  Actually, I am being generous. For all intents and purposes the Zi8 has no image stabilization.  At 1080p with IS on hand holding the camcorder while holding the breath produces a very noticeable shake in the captured video.  I found that using a tripod placed on my deck still resulted in some jitters from people/dogs walking on the deck (though not too bad).  With the Canon, none of these jitters were present.  Simply put the IS on the Zi8 is a completely fabricated marketing joke.  Useless for anything other than draining the battery faster.  If you do not want to induce motion sickness on all who watch your videos you must use a tripod with the Zi8-PERIOD.  I really am not kidding here.  It's just not possible to hand hold this unit at 1080p and not get a shaky cam effect that is really nauseating to view for more than a couple minutes.  This is true of all pocket cams and it takes either a tripod or 'real' image stabilization to deal with this effect.  The Zi8 has no real IS, it's nothing more than a marketing gimmick.  The lack of true IS means fast moving subjects as well as panning is affected by a blurring effect and all handheld scenarios record a nauseating jitter.  The 720p/60fps is better than the 1080p/30fps in this regard, but not by a lot.  Unless you will use the Zi8 set on a solid surface, please do yourself a favor and get a mini tripod for it.  Search Amazon for ' Gorillapod ' to find what I consider to be the most superior 'mini' tripod on the market today.- Low light:  Roughly equal with a slight nod to the Canon.  I was actually surprised at the video quality of the Zi8 in low light.  By low light I mean indoor lighting at night.  It is not great.  There is no camera or camcorder at any price that is great under such conditions, there are only varying degrees of bad.  Having said that the Zi8 shows oddly colored pixels where black should be before the Canon does, but not by much.  For a pocket cam it is actually respectable (but again, nothing is great under such lighting).Field of view:  This is an area I consider critical, but rarely is it even mentioned in professional reviews.  I wont go into the numbers, but the Zi8 has a pretty narrow field of view.  What this means is that the camcorder needs to be pretty far away from the subject to fit everything into the frame.  The Canon has a much more generous field of view and in fact the pocket cams for 2011 all seem to be offering 'super wide angle' lenses standard.  This is probably the worst part about this cam because there is nothing that can compensate for it.  A tripod can compensate for motion blur (to an extent) and jittery video, turning on more lights can compensate for low light scenarios, an external mic can compensate for the limits of the internal mic etc.  Nothing can compensate for the lack of a wide angle lens though.  For example if you wanted to record a crowd of kids around your dinner table during a B-Day party you would need to have the cam 15' or so away to fit everyone in. Not everyone's room sizes will be able to accommodate this. With a wide angle lens you could do the same thing from 6-7 feet away.To sum up, the Zi8 doesn't really compare with a $500-$800 camcorder.  If you need top notch results don't even consider the Zi8.  Still, for the price, it's probably the best all around camcorder available and the better quality camcorders simply will not fit in your pocket.  I wouldn't have bought the Zi8 if not for it's pocket size and it's now bargain basement price (I got it for $70 shipped).  To get the most out of it you will need to spend another $50-$100 on accessory items.  These items can be reused on any camcorder you purchase in the future.  The items are an external mic for top notch audio and a mini tripod for stability.  Really I would recommend an external shotgun mic and tripod at any price point, it's just that with the Zi8 and all pocket camcorders the tripod is pretty much mandatory to avoid motion sickness inducing video.  The audio is fine as is if you are OK with 'normal' camcorder audio, otherwise you need an external mic.You can get much, much better camcorders if you shop smart and buy last year's model on closeout.  For these expect to pay around $300-400 for something that originally retailed for $500-800.  It won't fit in your pocket though and that's the primary reason (other than it's now closeout price) to get the Zi8.At it's price point the Zi8, introduced in 2009, is still at the top of the heap in early 2011.  Even the successors from Kodak don't really improve on it's video quality at 2-3 times the price.  This is a real gem as long as it remains available, but please do not expect it to compare favorably in terms of video quality/IS to a $500+ camcorder.Put it on a solid surface, with good lighting and you will likely be impressed.  Beyond this use, more expensive camcorders that unfortunately won't fit in your pocket will kick the snot out of this and all other pocket sized camcorders.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, should be your first consideration", "Author": "B. Hayashi", "ReviewID": "R12JEHN4F25JHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many reviews on this digital camera, but I'll add my 2 cents worth.I purchased this to record my rehearsals and lessons at school. (I'm a doctoral candidate for choral conducting.) After researching many other cameras, I purchased this because:* It is small, light, and easily portable. IOW, something that I could just throw in my backpack and take to school without a lot of added bulk and weight.* It offered a variety of HD formats, including a still shot mode.* Reviewers said it had pretty good sound.* I could use an external stereo mic on it (no other pocket digital video cam can).* I could replace the battery and us back up batteries if one ran down.* I wanted to simply plug and play into my computer to transfer the files. The USB adapter flips right out and connects. Nice.* I wanted ample memory space and not worry on how long a video session would be if it ran over an hour. Since this takes up to a 32GB SD card, in 720p that equals to 11 hours of video!I must say that it fulfilled all of those criteria with aplomb! The picture quality is absolutely terrific on this unit. The internal mic is actually really good. (And I'm a professional musician.) I recorded a concert of mine and needed to show me conducting for my vita. I did not have time to place this in the middle and had it on far stage right (next to the sopranos) but the balance of the whole choir from its condenser mic was impressive. I thought all I would hear in the recording would be the sopranos, but the whole choir was surprisingly in very good balance. Impressive.It comes with software that works pretty nicely. You can easily transfer the videos/stills to any directory you want, delete the original files, and bulk name files--a very handy, time-saving feature. I just selected all videos from a hiking trip and labeled it \"Bear Valley Hiking\" and it automatically renamed from the stock alphanumeric name to the user friendly one and automatically numbered them in one mouse-click. Cool.I can also edit any of the videos, too.Just a few shortcomings that I've learned to live with that you see mentioned by others.* Though it has an anti-shake feature, it still is a small hand-held and you will find that it can be a little more shaky than a full-fledged camcorder. But it is not bad.* I wish it had an LED flash for the still camera.* Focusing can be a bit tricky for the still camera mode if the subject is in the no-man's land of being a tad bit close for the regular lens and a tad bit far for the close-up lens.* The view finder is non-flip and on the back. It makes it a bit harder to setup the framing if you are taping yourself as you have to be in the back of the camera.* Using the remote takes a little getting used to. It is a bit flaky as you need to get used to its response time and effective distance from the camera. It can be a very useful tool, though.All, in all, very small and livable shortcomings. With a camera this small, taking this high quality of pictures, at this price point, you are not going to find anything better. Certainly, this blows those Flip cameras out of the water.Highly recommended!", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really good IF you get a good one....", "Author": "Unknown Vincent", "ReviewID": "R2M2SI6FCP6HTX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Both the Kodak Zi8 and Zi6 have had early problems -like seizing up and over-heating, whiny internal mic recordings -so there are quite a few re-certified refurbished ones available -so that's both bad and good news.Even when buying a Kodak re-certified/refurbished unit -one can still get a faulty one - I did -thank goodness I dealt via Amazon with Adorama -the mark of a good vendor is not just whether they deliver -but how one is treated when something is wrong -all I can say is that Adormama were more than sterling.With that experience I took another chance and bought another refurbished one from Amazon/Adorama -with my previous experience I was able to thoroughly test this one, and it works just fine.Now to the Zi8 (being Kodak refurbished it has the latest firmware 1.06) -the video quality is really good even compared to the already good Zi6 - I can see a marked improvement over the Zi6's I have tried - the videos from the Zi8 look sharper and the colors looks really good - in fact I would go as far to say that the video quality looks as good as from any consumer camcorder I have seen.  Of course $700 camcorders will have much more flexibility with more and real optical zoom range better image stabilization - but they cost 6-10x as much and they are not pocketable.Most reviews will say the digital zoom is pretty poor - I have actually found the digital zoom surprisingly good all the way up to 4x - even with nose-to-monitor scrutiny - I was really surprised at this since I do a lot of photography and the first thing one learns is not to use any digital zoom - I can't explain this but the digital zoom on the Zi8 is good - more than just usable (note: I record at mainly 720p/30fps).The macro ability is also really good - the depth of field is shallow - so the trick is to set macro make sure the subject is in focus BEFORE starting the recording.That brings us to the LCD screen - it is high definition and sharp compared to other screens I have seen on the competition - so it is easy to see if the subject is in focus and whether the picture/scene looks good - although like any other LCD screen it will be hard to see in sunlight.One of the good features of the Zi8 is the ability to connect a stereo external mic - I have a pair of really good portable stereo mic's that I used for live music recording and the sound quality can be very good indeed -however I have found the internal mic although mono - can actually give pretty decent sound quality - there is a mic level adjustment under settings and the default middle setting seems to work really well - I recorded a big band with vocalist and the sound quality was very good.EIS (stabilization) does work - but obviously cannot cope with gross movement.It seems to work better at the normal wide-end, and less so when zoomed - but then when zoomed it is more sensitive to movement anyway.On my tests I got about 1hr 38mins on a full charge of the battery and at 720p/30fps I ended up with two files one at 2Gb (for 1hr 34mins) and the other at about 86Mb - so there is a limit of 2Gb file-size (due to I think the FAT32 format of the SDHC card) and for me the rate was just over 21Mb/minute.Note on video resolution -obviously the big selling point of the Zi8 is the ability to record full HD at 1080p - that's 1920x1080 - for me it's overkill -the 720p looks as good and the view is a bit wider and it has the ability to record at 60fps which is better for motion.But I'd like to point out that there is a WVGA setting which is not just the usual 640x480 - but 848x480 - that's really 480p wide-screen (16:9) format - this is actually really good for videos destined for standard DVDs - since DVD specifications are only 720x480 - so the Kodak Zi8 even on WVGA can produce videos good enough for standard DVDs.Stills - strictly for emergencies only - the stills at the normal wide end look just acceptable - but if the digital zoom is used then the still look very poor.Overall I like the Zi8 a lot it's a lot better than I expected in terms of video quality -that is if one gets a good one......However since the product is now more mature -hopefully this is not as uncertain as it may sound.PS - from what I have read (and I have read a lot) - part of the trick if one gets a faulty unit - is to return for exchange or refund with the vendor - do not use the Kodak warranty service as that can be slow - and possibly unreliable - (since I did buy a Kodak re-certified/refurbished unit previously that was faulty)", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Bang For Your Buck Pocket Cam.

The Zi8 records HD Video 720p and 1080, although to be honest it's 1080p isn't great but the 720p is awesome. The built in mic works pretty well but the Zi8`s strong suit is it has an audio-in jack for connecting external microphones, brilliant! The Zi8 takes still photos at 5MP and if its a bright sunny day the photos will be full of rich color and great clarity. However, if you're shooting indoors stills or video, bring a light because low light is definitely the Zi8's greatest weakness. If this pocket cam came with a built-in flash it would be the ultimate pocket cam. The other great feature this camera brings to the table is the use of SD memory cards instead of internal flash memory found on the Flip cams. HD video devours memory so having the ability to drop in a 16GB or 32GB SD card is awesome. Another cool feature the Kodak Zi8 has is it can zoom while shooting video which is a feature a lot of low cost cameras lack. However, the zooming itself isn't smooth it zooms in steps as opposed to smoothly closing in on your subject. Lastly, you can control the Zi8 by remote (sold separately) so if you want to record yourself without touching the camera you can do that.

The video quality is far from perfect, but for the price this is a steal.

My wife is very happy to have a simple device, and I an VERY happy that we'll have HD video of the babies 10 and 20 years down the road.  (We have a mini-CD camcorder, but it is standard NTSC and takes a good 20-30 seconds to get going.  With the babies, 20 or 30 seconds' delay usually translates into a missed opportunity.)My one complaint about this camera would be the blurry zone between 'macro' and regular, maybe 8 to 18 inches.  This effectively prevents me from taking video where one of the babies' faces fills the screen. But again, at this price, this is a reasonable compromise.I would recommend downloading the \"extended user guide\" after ordering.

The positives are that it is very portable and it has an external mic plugin, and the USB cable is built in so it makes it easy to connect up to the computer.The cons are big though. There is no (meaningful) image stabilization, if you are not going to use a tripod all the time the images will be VERY shaky even with your steadiest hand. Second, image quality is terrible in low light, and most videos indoors are terrible. The only setting that creates anything close to quality image is the 1080p. Our five year old Cannon Powershot does much better than this camera at video, so except for being slightly more portable its worse video than most digital cameras.  Also the features are limited. It makes the camera easy to use, but it also means it is not much more advanced than a cell phone camera - no zoom, the only real options are four kinds of video quality (which again, you will only use 1080p). Last, if you have a windows machine you can't use any photo editing software (Windows Movie Maker, etc) until you first convert the format - it saves natively to Quicktime format (.MOV). Which means if we take a video with the camera rotated, just to rotate the video 90 degrees takes an hour through a conversion software first, then we can use Windows movie maker.

small  * approximately 50 minutes on one battery charge  * flexible, flip-out USB connection (unlike rigid flipcam / minoHD version)  * HDMI connection  * external microphone input / jack  * decent on-board audio quality  * removable SD memory card  * good resolution choices: 1080p, 720p (60fps and 30fps), and WVGA  * turns off quick  * macro setting easy and on topCONS:  * low-light situation induced vertical / purple / red / pink lines in 720p mode  * no real control over picture quality - automatic to the extreme  * back-side of camera gets hot after extended use  * image stabilization is useless  * case a bit too flexible and video aberrations noted if manhandled excessively  * no LCD to verify good shot framing  * record status LED is annoyingly placed, bright, and red  * metal

The sound is great with one.I love the ease of use.Picture quality, in most cases, is very good.I can fit a lot of video on my 32GB card.The price is great!I'm not a video geek but here's why I sent it back.EIS doesn't seem to do anything.  The pic. is very, very shakey.  With EIS on it becomes jerky.The lens should be a wider view.  I have to move way back to get a couple of people in around the table at birthdays and family functions.  This is the main reason I bought it.Pic gets grainy in med. lighting.  But for a camera at this price it is still acceptable.But what made me send it back is the fact that Kodak knows of the zoom problem.  I called them and they say they have no intention of releasing a firmware update to correct it.  Instead, they release a new version of the camera with a better video quality, a wider angle lens and the zoom works.  It's the PlaySport.  And it's less expensive than the Zi8 and it's waterproof.I know it doesn't have the macro (I will never use it) or the external mic.  But the built in mic. performance is supposed to be quite an improvement over the zi8 in the reviews I have read.  Still, I would have loved the external mic. option on the playsport.  But for the price, it has a lot of features.If Kodak would simply have released the firmware update I would have kept the camera.  But they choose to screw over existing customers and come out with a new product instead.  That's just wrong.I am going to buy the PlaySport because the batteries and accessories I purchased for the Zi8 will still work.

I ran into a problem where my SD card apparently wasn't fast enough to handle recording in HD modes. It would record for 2-3 seconds and stop. I finally took a guess that it was indeed my card and switched to a spare SDHC card that I had around. That fixed that problem....whew!Now for the recording. At first, it was a little disappointing. I started testing the camera around 7pm and the light was minimal. My first impressions were not so good. Low light shooting on this camera is not the best in the world. It's acceptable but certainly not impressive.This morning I decided to give it another go. Am I glad I did! The video quality I am getting from this little Zi8 is VERY Impressive indeed! With the right amount of light you can't ask for better HD video quality from something under $200. It's quite unbelievable how much video taking power one can have in there hands for so little money these days. Colors are vivid and accurate. Sound quality is quite good from the built in mic as well.I would suggest giving this camera a try for sure. Set your expectations accordingly. I think a lot of hype has been given to this camera since it was first released and possibly too much expectation has resulted from this hype.

I was cautious opening this in case I was going to return it. We shot some nighttime video in a store with florescent lighting; I expected it to be really poor. The camera did a good job of handling white balance. The PC software that comes with this camera is the first I've seen that will actually let the user trim clips, set transitions, rotate clips, and correct for back lighting. The Vado software was crippleware, the user was expected to buy more \"styles\" to make the software more functional. The Kodak PC editor is surprisingly functional. If you have a Mac, this camera is ideal; the video needs _no_ preprocessing.Although I purchased the camera in early Dec 2009 (a \"latest model\"), both the software and camera firmware needed to be upgraded (easy and worth the time).These sub-$200 cameras *all* suffer from jelly-video if they are moved quickly, but can produce very clean and sharp video if hand-held very stationary. They do not require a tripod unless you are /very/ jittery but they do require attention when videoing. They work best when doing a series of stationary shots separated by short pans, rather than one large pan like with $600 videocams. The audio quality seems to be about the same as other cameras in this price range. The Kodak is the only one so far that allows one to use an external microphone. For me, this is not an issue since I usually put a music soundtrack into my video.If this is your first videocam and you expect to take good one-handed video of Timmy running across the room, you'll probably be disappointed with /any/ camera of this ilk. If you recognize the limitations, then one can take surprisingly good video (and post process it well) with this camera. I recommend it highly.P.S. There were several issues with early versions of this camera; Kodak corrected them. If you read reviews about audio noise and video stripes, these have been corrected. If you buy a \"latest version\" from someone like Amazon whose stock rotates quickly, you should be well pleased with this camera.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Crystal Clear", "Author": "T.

I bought a 32GB SD Card and everything seems to work great.I highly recommend anyone to get this camera.One of the best things I also like is that Kodak actually listens to the feedback of its customers. When the microphone on the units were making hissing noises, they produced a firmward to eliminate that. Secondly, when people when complaining that the zoom feature was too jumpy and not smooth, they listened again. The zoom feature on the new firmward is smooth now.

reprocessed and make my claim look ridiculous.What I wish someone had warned me about:-Bad vertical lines on any video resolution that is not 1080p(what the H?!)...I bought this for 1080p so I won't bitch too much.-Fixed focus lens, your choices are 1 foot(macro)away or 5 feet to infinity away(?!) Nothing in-between?! I am finding I often want footage at the 3 foot range, but it is NOT an option*. (*Until I add the cheap wide angle lens adapter I got -which seems to solve this problem, but I have to figure out some kind of mount...) I think this fixed focus issue is what has people thinking that the 1080p mode is soft. Not soft, you are not the right distance from subject:)What I DO like:-1080p  mode in good light looks AMAZING. Very sharp and seems to handle high motion well...bitrate seems to peak around 16mbps-So far I am happy with the internal mic-Ease of use-Low price-Ability to add external stereo mic-Cheap enough that I don't mind making some alterations(adding wide angle lens)I'm happy -but I do like to tinker.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Product info", "Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "R1CRHDEHY5BB4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't rate this product because I haven't bought it yet but like to complain about Amazon's lack of product info.

Shooting on this thing was a breeze, and it looks good on the small 2\" screen, clear and sharp. ( i shot on 720p 60fps, image stabalizer on)  However as I uploaded the .mov files into my computer and watched them,  the screen shakiness was horrid. There was micro shakes in the shots where I tried to be as still as possible, and even worse on shots where I tried to do smooth pans across a street.  I really wanted to puke....Never had I felt this dizzy since watching Cloverfield in the theatres.  The image wasn't as hd sharp as I thought. Not even close. But Cnet did warn us that these devices aren't true HD's like the cameras that are hundreds of dollars more. It's only slightly better than standard quality.  My biggest problem was the screen shakiness.....I've shot concerts and videos on my point-and-shoot Canon Powershot Camera before...where I was holding the camera up with one hand for an hour....and the playback on those videos were fine....But I couldn't even watch a 10 second clip I shot on the Kodak Zi8.....the stabalization is horrid...I even tried to resize the clip to a smaller 320x480'ish  size to see if the shakiness was better but it was still there. I made about 100 short clips and on almost half of them the recording play back stuttered slightly where it looked like it was playing at 23 fps instead of 60fps....I was very surprised by this.  You are better off making standard quality videos on your point and shoot camera....the sound recording and picture quality is much better on those than this HD Kodak camcorder... =(  Yeah the sound is really bad on the Kodak Zi8 too....  To think the Flip Ultra's and Mino HD's don't even have Image stabalizer.....I could only imagine those handheld camcorders might be even worse.....I hope this helps......I'm going to try returning this to Best Buy.....", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Listen to the Bad Reviews", "Author": "Mayakah Hunter", "ReviewID": "R2O0MUE3AXIXK1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There is a debate in the reviews as to whether or not this camera has lines that ruin the picture quality.

Bring on Zi9!!!", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great choice for external mic and macro mode", "Author": "Marlon R.", "ReviewID": "R2I5YL8L7T613X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera in early 2011 after a ton of research and near sleepless nights reading reviews & watching video. Color me obsessed. The Zi8 is not perfect, but for the money and features it will deliver what you need.  It seems to have gone up in price since I bought, maybe Kodak realized they had a winner on their hands.What I like:compact design and varied ability to shoot standard def, and 3 different HD modes (720, 720/60fps for fast action, and 1080). The best features about this camera are without a doubt the external mic input and the amazing macro mode. This camera really excels in macro mode (that means super close focus for you newbies). There is a switch that allows you to go from normal focus to close up mode, and it works while you are shooting so you can go back & forth. There will be a slight \"click\" in your recordings if you do this, but its not a big bother. The close-up image quality is really quite astounding for a camera in this price range.The external mic input is an absolute must. I will also say that this unit has a very good onboard mic despite some of the reviews. Its ahead of most of the other digicams with regard to built-in mics that I researched. That was key in my buying decision. the onboard mic will do the job for you. But for really professional \"amateur\" video, you really should take advantage of the external mic. There are many recommendations about mics, but I can tell you even my cheap 8-year old Logitech computer mic works great & is noise free. I've recorded speech and music with it and it sounds great.For those that don't know, the issue with onboard mics on cameras: they pick up motor noise from the camera running, especially when the auto-focus or zoom engages. Use of an external mic, even a cheap one, completely eliminates this hassle. It also allows you to move the mic closer to the subject. This is great for YouTube videos or anyone doing product reviews. If there is just one thing you can do to improve your amateur videos, it's use of external mic.I also like the display and the camera is fairly easy to navigate the menus. It shoots & records video quickly, no lag-time in playback or turning on or off.Software-the included software is surprisingly good. Has some editing feature and color correction too that is really nice even though I use separate more professional programs for that.What I don't like:Its a little clunky moving around the menus and the tiny joystick is just okay. Not sure if buttons would be better, but its got buttons too. You can probably figure out this camera without the instruction manual, Kodak makes straightforward stuff where this is concerned. But do read the instructions (for example, you'll find that the brightness setting in the camera does nothing for the shooting, its just for the LCD as briefly explained in the instructions. There would be no way to know this otherwise & I wasted a good deal of time shooting comparison videos on different brightness settings for nothing!) The instructions could be more detailed, but they are better than most instructions that come with electronics these days. It seems companies these days have short-changed their users by shortening up the instructions, but print them in four additional languages you can't read in the same booklet.The camera has an auto-shutoff which happens every five minutes or so if untouched. This can be annoying when its setup on a tripod ready to shoot, but hey it saves battery life.The LCD is pretty good but I still find it small and you have to really get up on it to see the video. For the money its fine, but this may bother some people.Don't buy this camera thinking you'll get great still photos despite the higher MP rating. The still shots are okay, but would guess most high-end smartphones will take better stills and there is no flash. This is not a replacement for a good point-and-shoot camera for stills, but it would do the job for a quick shot here & there when you can't carry your bigger camera.It would have been nice if Kodak put a light on the front of the camera so you knew it was recording. Instead, there is just a \"beep\" to let you know its rolling if you aren't able to see the LCD (like if its on a tripod and you're filming yourself).There is no flash on this unit.Tips:Get some cheap spare batteries that are compatible, and get a remote & AC adapter. Amazon is great for this. I have two batteries and the adapter & have never run out of juice. The AC adapter is crucial because while it really won't charge the battery, it will run your camera on AC while you are shooting video and saves your battery. I have the remote also, another inexpensive purchase, its not labeled that well but it does work and will save you from having to get up and touch the camera again.Make sure you have enough light for shooting indoors and research \"3 point lighting\" on YouTube or wherever. Its a simple technique and can make your indoor videos really pop. I have shot many hours of video before I found out about this technique.All in all:Good value, good images, true HD with options, nice mic input and great macro mode. Good for normal shooting and fast action. Onboard mic is good enough but ext mic option way better. A little clunky getting around the menus and user controls but the finished product is really good. At the time of my purchase there was no equal camera with these features in the price range.Another winner from Kodak!", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "No longer good value for the money...

This is quite a good price for what you get (good performance including good internal mic) but at $150 I would look either to a cheaper Flipcam or else to a higher-end AVCHD camera (in the end I replaced it with a used Canon Vixia HF10 at $200).  Reason being, I shoot professional web video and I found the nighttime white balance terrible (and I could not figure out how to correct it) and the external mic jack was VERY noisy regardless of the input source.Another reviewer states that he used this camera with an Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier mic, I tried this and it didn't work well, I actually think reviewer is incorrect as this is a low-output mic which requires a very high external mic gain on the camera which makes a very poor circuit design even worse.  The internal mic was much better then the ATR-3350 (at a distance of about 6 feet) and particularly with Audacity noise reduction (through Sony Vegas) it was quite good.So in summary if your purpose is quick promotional video for the web (like at 640x480 or 640x360) its fine but if you want professional-quality video it won't cut it.Another very annoying thing was that it only comes with a 128MB SDHC Card so you will need to budget another $10-25 for an upgrade.I believe that this camera has been replaced by the Kodak Zi10 Play Touch ($124 best price) however this is a slightly inferior camera so not recommended for this purpose either.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Clarity for a portable HD Video/Camera", "Author": "B.

My experience is amazing and the clarity is amazing! While in bright conditions the glare on monitor is a little more difficult to see. It is portable and lightweight for meeting nearly all of your needs. I viewed my videos on my HD Flat Panel TV and was very impressed. I was also impressed by simply viewing them by plugging in the Zi8 Kodak into computers outlet. The negative part of the camera/video is the fluttering affect- even when image stabilization is turned on. I notice this more as a result of rapid movement from side to side and zooming in. The conditions are a April evening in South Florida.I hope that you are pleased with my review and find it informative in making your decisionNOTE: I WILL ATTEMPT TO UPLOAD A SMALLER VIDEO FILE AS THE ONE I HAD WAS TO LARGE", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really exceeded my expectations", "Author": "amznuser34", "ReviewID": "R39BPZELSM7YGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive tried other 'mini' camcorders before and could never find one that could deliver outstanding picture quality to compliment its convenient small size.  With my Disney World vacation fast approaching, I started looking for a new camcorder late last month to replace my Cannon Hi8 digital.  After doing some research, I had narrowed it down to the Sony Bloggie Touch and this Kodak zi8.  I finally decided to go with the zi8 and could not be more pleased with it.  Ironically, my parents were about to leave for their own Disney vacation and after seeing my new camera, wanted me to order one for them.  I was very curious to see how this camera would perform and when they returned this past week I was very pleasantly surprised.I used the HDMI cable that was included with the camera to connect it to our 42 inch LG HDTV.  Right from the first moments of playback that I watched, the camera had already exceeded my expectations of it.  Video taken in the daylight outdoors was virtually flawless, other than some quick auto focus issues but they had more to do with how the person operating the camera was holding/moving it around.  I knew going in that it does not perform as well in lower light setting but if more of the lighting is on the subject and not the operator, then it still produces great quality video.  Even nighttime fireworks shows came out great as long as the camera is kept very still.  NOTE:  The recording mode 720p @ 60 frames/second shot the best video quality.The audio quality also impressed me with all sounds and voices being picked up very clearly and no noise from the cameras operation was heard at all upon playback.  I paired the camera with a Transcend 16 GB Class 6 (TS16GSDHC6E) memory card and the (Kodak 1736933) silicone sleeve.  Now I'm looking forward to using it on my trip also.I would highly recommend this camera to someone looking for a 'pocket' sized camera that can deliver HD quality recordings, without having to purchase a high end camera.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent video camera", "Author": "gadget guy", "ReviewID": "R3711MJ2ZUNJTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is excellent, without question. If you've been the video person for all your events through the years, do NOT look any further than the Zi8. It has everything you need to be a pro-am videographer. The biggest notable feature inclusions in this camera is independent memory cards and an external mic jack. These two features alone make this very reasonably priced camera worth the price of admission. I can't stress enough how important the external mic jack is. Drop every other cool feature you may be tempted by with the other cams, in favor of this feature. ESPECIALLY if you plan on using this for business presentations, band gigs, or higher end video shoots. You may think you'll never need it but trust me, if and when you do you'll know why the external mic jack is so great. The picture quality, in my opinion, beats ALL of the other offerings in this category- be it full light AND low light. I could add a video to my review but there's a ton of examples out there on video hosting sites to see for yourself. It becomes obvious after you start comparing picture qualities. Also do a search for mic comparisons with the Zi8 and hear for yourself why it's so huge that Kodak included the capability to use external mics.Out of the box, I needed no instructions to get the battery charging. Easy. The only time I cracked the rather modest manual is for a couple of navigational how-to's, as well as getting out the USB arm and hooking it up to the PC. It's worth reading through the manual as well- a short no nonsense read that will help. All in all, it's a really easy camera to operate. Don't fret over the LCD screen size either. I wear glasses and I STILL hoped like heck it would be big enough for me. I hate that screens are so small now. The LCD size is perfectly fine. I have no problems and I'm picky.The software has gotten slammed a bunch so I'll touch on it. It's basic. Those of you who don't do much editing will like it. Those of you who do may never open it up, once installed. It had an immediate update once installed, so of course I did it with no problems. I'll mention that if it wasn't part of the older versions, this newest one has the ability to render to MP4 and AVI when you publish to your computer- an option within the software. That seems like a good attempt on Kodaks part to resolve complaints about .MOV files locking you in without using third party converters. Re-rendering to different formats is just a part of digital life and if you want to get in this game you're gonna have to get savvy about the process. If it's not your cup of tea, stick with analog tape cameras and dump them out to dvd, or get a dvd cam. This type of camera has so much going for it that it's very much worth the learning curve of file management. Once you do it some, you get the hang of it and all the implications of resolution choices and such. It's not that hard for the computer/software inclinded. In the end, you'll either find Kodaks editing software enough, or you'll be relying on better software. Frankly, I found the editing preview playback to be glitchy and not really useable for serious editing. There are some settings to tweak though, such as accelerators within the program, that could help that. I didn't try, as I use another editor. The software should also be tweaked to include much more email choices for sending files, such as gmail, hotmail, etc. It only picked up on outlook and outlook express on my laptop. I haven't used those accounts in years. I believe it'll pick up on AOL too, but I haven't used THAT in even more years.Really, what more could you ask for? Great picture quality, portability, memory card sizes of your choosing, separate batteries so you can keep filming, a universal tripod mount, external mic jack, all the cables included, and editing software. What's the ONE thing I wish this camera had, out of the box? A lense cover- just as simple as that. It should have one. But this is one hell of a package for the average user and even the more advanced user. I was on the fence between the Zi8 and a toshiba camileo S20 because of some features it has to offer. I am so, so glad I chose the Zi8 instead. I gave flips a short consideration too, but there's no comparison to the Zi8. This Kodak has it all over them. I recommend the Kodak Zi8 highly. I'm planning some pretty high end shoots with this thing and I have no doubt it will handle it.

I bought it from Amazon for about $99 which I thought was a great price.  I took it to my birthday party at a night club.  It was able to take great HD video, even in the low lighting and loud music conditions of the club.  In situations where you don't want to bring a large video cam with you, this works great.  You can put it in your pocket and take it anywhere.  Also, I think friends/family are less intimidated by a smaller camera and more willing to have fun then if you had a large camera on them.  The only issue I had was that it comes with only 128 mb of memory.  You can only take about 10 seconds (yes seconds!) of video with the built in memory.  I had to run to Best Buy to get a memory card.  With a 16GB card you can record about 2.5 hours of video which is good.  You can also get a 32GB if you plan to record more.

The reason being, my father is real big on shooting home videos and has been trying (ever slowly) to enter the digital age.  He has used the video function on his digital point and shoot cameras, but I figured the Kodak would be a simple and easy way to help him transition into digital home movies.I'm basing this review on my dad's experience (which is in short, someone who doesn't feel extremely comfortable with technology, but wants to get into it more).He really enjoyed using the camera thanks to its easy to use interface.  The instruction manual is pretty slim, and there is a reason for that.  It literally is a point and shoot video camera, much like the flip cam.  But what made me buy this one was the fact that it came with an included HDMI cable and an SD HC slot.  While the flip is all about internal memory, the Kodak only has a small amount of that built in.  It's more of an SD HC card video camera, so please keep that in mind before purchasing this camera.  If you're looking to shoot only on internal memory, this camera isn't for you.As I mentioned, the interface is simple and easy to figure out.  The picture quality of the camera is surprisingly good.  His first video was shot on 720p and when I hooked up the camera to my HDTV the image looked pretty decent.  Shooting on 1080 produced a surprisingly crisp and clear picture, which to be honest I wasn't totally expecting as I bought a Kodak camera at a relatively low price.  However, this camera definitely surprised me.  I did not use an external mic so I am unable to describe it here, however, from a pure point and shoot perspective, my dad loved the camera.  Even in low lighting conditions I found that the camera produced some pretty sharp images.  Impressive.My only gripe is that the camera battery needs to be charged with the entire camera itself.  There is no stand alone battery charger included with the camera (which is a pain if my dad say, wanted to charge one battery while using the camera with another).Bottom line:I like:1. Great budget friendly camera2. Not intimidating to use, and great for even tech noobs3. Nice big screen on the camera itself for easy viewing4. Has SD HC slot5. Includes HDMI cable for cameraI don't like:1. No battery charger included (i.e. have to charge battery w/camera cable)2. No real internal memory3. Seems a bit light/cheaply made, but that's just nitpickingAll in all, I still recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a pretty good camera for a good price.

It does a great job in fair to good light situations which covers what trade shows and interviews I require it for. However in low lighting situations, it is unusable. Example would be a low light or candlelight restaurant or museum/aquarium. If Kodak were to add a flash and zoom to this camera and increase the 5mp to 10mp, it would be perfect. It takes decent 5mp pics and the video choices are fine for uploading to youtube and facebook. If you want better quality snapshots with higher resolution, carry a better camera with that capability as I do for my job. It has a sleek look and feels good in your hand. I use a tripod for video because you will need to move very slow/steady when videoing by hand. I also use a 16gb high end card for video editing. I like the usb direct connect from the camera. I purchased 3 extra batteries and a quick charger for the amount of use for my job. The other item I do not like is the internal microphone. I had to purchase a splitter and two external mics, one for my interviewing and one for the perspective interviewing client. I have had a lot of compliments and questions as passers by see the Zi8 being used. For the price it does the job for my use without buying a high cost, high end video camera. I recommend a good wireless mic if using it from a 15ft-20ft plus activity. Finally, close-up shots and close-up video clarity needs to be improved. All close-ups are fuzzy. I stay back about 1ft so everything stays in focus. I read the reviews of the new Kodak Playtouch since it has a zoom, but the reviews on the videos and the zoom were not good. I will await the next Kodak upgrade improvement and reviews. I realize I am trying to do a professional job with a semi-professional camera, but with department budget economics, I needed to find the best product to do a quality job at a decent lower cost. Based on all these pros and cons, I gave the camera 4 stars.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Video, Great Value", "Author": "Timothy B.

a good choice because of the different lighting variations. We also didn't use the lavalier microphone so you can hear what the normal mic pics up and filmed this all by hand without the use of a tripod.We're an international adventure travel company, and we needed something that we could bring on our trips.Our Wish List:- A camera that was small and light weight for travel.- A camera that had an external mic plug-in.- Something relatively inexpensive.- With fantastic picture quality- A long battery life- Records in a file that is easy to editAfter some exhaustive research we found that the Zi8 was our best option and we \"almost\" got everything on our \"Wish List.\"Small/ CompactPro:  The camera is very small and light weight.  It's about the size of my cell phone and perfect for throwing in our bags while trekking some jungle trails.Cons: NoneExternal Mic Plug-inPro: This camera has it!  We use the Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone and it works perfectly!Cons: I'm glad the camera has an external mic plug-in because the regular camera mic is not all that fantastic.  It works and sounds OK, but it's just not spectacular.  Beyond probably 4 feet from the camera, the sound becomes muffled.InexpensivePro: Roughly $150!!! We're pretty active on our trips with hiking, rafting, kayaking, etc.. so the potential for damage is there.  We wanted to get a camera that if damaged we wouldn't spend a  whole lot of time crying over it.Picture QualityPro:  This camera shoots in HD.  We shoot all of our videos in 720p and the picture quality has met our expectations.Cons: The camera does get kind of temperamental in low light situations, but this really hasn't been much of a problem.Battery LifePro: At least it has one.Cons: It doesn't last very long.  While shooting in 720p with image stabilization turned off we get roughly an 1 hr. 30 min - 2 hr.'s of film.  I wish it was longerEditingPro: It does have editing software that is built into the camera and it is very basic.  Probably good enough for family videos.Cons: This camera records only in .mov files.  If your looking to do some real editing, and you have a PC, Good luck to you.  We searched for a good program to edit these videos on our PC's with no luck.  It's possible, but just not very easy.  We ended up just buying some Mac's and editing is a breeze!  Imovie loves .mov files.Here are a couple of other little things we learned about the camera.Image Stabilization- the camera comes with image stabilization.  We have ran many tests and have found no difference with having it on or off.  If your recording while walking with this in your hands, while watching the video on playback make sure you have a barf bag available.  You're in for a bumpy ride.We ended up purchasing some extra equipment which has proved to be very valuable.The Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone has proven to be a valuable asset while conducting interviews or when in a noisy jungle and we want our voices to actually be heard.The AZDEN CAM-3 On-Camcorder Mini Audio Mixer has been valuable when wanting to hook up multiple microphones at one time.The Tekkeon TekCharge MP1800 has been useful in extending the battery life.  Instead of around 2 hours of film time, we can now get about 5 hours on one charge.The XShot Camera Extender - Black (XS2379) is a great hand held tool which allows you to record yourself without having to set up the full tri-pod. The XShot also seems to steady the camera a bit while walking and filming yourself.A Tripod.  You're going to need one.  This camera will screw onto any standard tripod stand.If you want to see some more videos that were filmed using this camera just go to FalkAdventures.com and look in the blog section.Overall, we think this is a great camera.  It's done everything that we've needed it to do and I would recommend it for anyone who's looking for an inexpensive camera that shoots great quality video as long as you can either keep your arm really steady or use a tri-pod.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8-awesome little camera !!!!", "Author": "John Gannon", "ReviewID": "R2KPL6IF63OAKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Kodak Zi-8 for 9 months now.

The outdoor video quality approaches my expensive Sony hi-def camcorder, the low lite indoor quality is OK but not the greatest. The ease of putting videos on Youtube, etc is a major plus and I can plug it into my 58\" plasma and watch high quality videos immediately. My twin girls love that!!!

Budd", "ReviewID": "R24TY1TNWBSXMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item as a Christmas present for my wife.  As an aside, she is very, shall we say, \"gadget aware,\" by which I mean she quickly assesses electronic products like this for size, function, ease of use, convenience, and general attractiveness, and is more than willing to turn her nose up at something that doesn't cut it.  Other items have quickly disappeared into the cupboard and never seen again.This camera has been a hit, to say the least.  It is lightweight and sleek, easily fitting into a pocket or carry-along bag.  Its appearance is suitably appealing.  The quality of the video it captures is very, very good, even when expanded to television-sized screens (we've not yet projected it onto a 100-inch screen, but will try it).The camera was used by her to capture our Christmas-day activities, especially our four-year old son opening his presents and playing.  The camera is inconspicuous enough that it did not draw his attention and thus compromise 'candid' shots.  To those of you who have small children, this feature cannot be overstated. It has subsequently been on a trip to Cancun, where it was used to record and share high-quality images of him playing in the sand, in the waves, around the pool, etc.  Since I could not go (working), it was terrific to be able to see each evening videos of the two of them playing.Which gets to the final point- it is quite easy to capture the video and then transfer it to the computer (e.g., youtube, facebook, other social media share sites).  For the non-tech savvy, this is an excellent way by which you can easily, quickly, and conveniently share important moments with friends and family who may be far away. In short, for the relatively low price, it's an excellent buy for people who like to shoot and share video memories, and you need not be Cecil B. DeMille or Alan Turing to use it.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8 HD pocket video camera", "Author": "g. goodrich", "ReviewID": "R9FGHO7KL5MFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this pocket video camera in November 2009 shortly before a Mediterranean cruise and after the birth of a grandchild.  I was interested in the HD capability; the shirt pocket portability and  HD quality upon playback. The following are my experiences with this camera to date:HD capability: Although there is a 1080p setting and the picture quality is very good, it is not the quality of the more expensive video cameras on the market today. The 720p, 60 fps may actually create a better video especially if there is action in the video. Many times it is a toss-up as to recording in 1080p or 720p @ 60 fps. The two basic settings on the focal length are good but be aware that moving the telephoto feature during a video is not very smooth and can be a bit annoying on playback on a HDTV. The decision to purchase this camera comes down to the tradeoff between size and portability and having the best HD clarity and full function video. If the video product is mainly for the internet, this camera will likely be fine, if you're archiving young children's activities, doing fast action or low light videos you would be better off spending more money to get a full function video camera. I would also caution someone who is annoyed by less than very high quality video upon playback on HDTV's etc.Firmware updates: I know some reviews have commented on the difficulty with the firmware updating process. I had no trouble at all. I used a Macbook Pro and followed the on-line directions explicitly and everything was fine.Playback is very easy on most TV's especially those with HDMI inputs. The connectivity features of this camera are excellent and playback directly from the camera to an HDTV are simple, fast and of high quality. The enclosed cable from the camera to an HDMI input is all that is required. The flip-out USB connector is very good. The camera also has an intuitive video indexing feature which makes playbacks of many different video clips relatively easy.Portability: this camera is truly shirt pocket portable and I can be carrying this camera more often and have it on me for unanticipated opportunities for a short video clip. This size of camera is not very obtrusive when recording. One of my peeves is people on trips running around with large video camera's recording everything in sight. This camera allows for short, discreet video captures.I am very satisfied with this camera and rated it quite high. It is important to understand this camera's features, capabilities, and limitations and compare that to the applications and features you value most. Thinking this through will produce the best buying decision.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hell of a device - Blows all others out of the water", "Author": "Zachary D. Saltman", "ReviewID": "R1Q8LBIYBYN2US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this from bestbuy (they gave me 50% off b/c the box had been opened but the camcorder never used - sick deal).I was looking at all the pocket HD camcorders, and had decided the Kodak Zi8 was too expensive. Thank god I found this deal, because this thing is worth every damn penny, even paying the full retail price.I'm in Colorado skiing right now, and took the Zi8 up on the mountain. I used picture mode, as well as the 720p 60fps (sport) mode for action ski videos. I haven't gotten home yet to upload to my computer, but the pictures and videos look pristine on the camcorder itself (which has a great quality and size screen). The 720p 60fps HD video didn't miss a thing. Flawlessly smooth with video quality so high that I can't even imagine what the 1080p would look like. I was holding it filming as I skied through dense trees, so it handled both fast action motion and low-light conditions. Basically, both the picture and video quality was great on the mountain, even when the visability and lighting was bad. I almost forgot, even the digital zoom was way better than I'd expect. This thing just blew me away.I'll break down why this thing is by far the most superior pocket HD camcorder:1. Quality. nothing can touch this thing in that department, unless you go up to bigger HD camcorders obviously.2. Takes Pictures. I don't have a digital camera, so I wanted a pocket HD camcorder that takes good quality stills. The ever-so-popular Flip doesn't do stills, and the other ones that do don't do them well from what I hear.3. Build/Design. Well constructed, sleek, very easy to use, beautiful large screen for reviewing your stills and videos. Having physical buttons instead of \"touch\" buttons is often overlooked. You always know what you're pressing, and you don't ever accidentally mess up your videos, because you don't have to worry about those annoying \"touch\" buttons.4. accessories. comes with ALL the cords and TV cables you'd need (for HD and SD TVs), as well as a nice leather wrist-strap, which I loved b/c it made sure I didn't drop it into the snow.Only criticisms (minor as they are):1. a little big, but not bad. Kind of like the size of a Blackberry, maybe a tad bigger. Can't be greedy though, this thing films 1080p full HD, and 60fps 720p HD. It's tiny when you consider that fact.2. software. CORRECTION: I initially said the Arcsoft MediaImpression software didn't run well, but it works fine. It's quite adequate, and from the reviews of other comparable devices, it seems superior.3. price. It's pricey, but man is it worth it. Especially when the Flip is similarly priced.This is my favorite gadget in awhile. The pros WAAAAY outweigh the cons (which are nearly non-existent).

Here are the issues I ran into:-Received my camcorder with firmware 1.06 that was supposed to fix old issues, but only brought new ones.-When recording indoors in low light, blue line appears across recordings...very frustrating and makes recording indoors a pain.-When zooming in indoors, after zooming in about halfway the image goes dark, I mean really dark. When zoomed back out it lightens up again, but whats the point of having zoom if it goes dark every time you zoom in?-Also, the thin streaks....this is an issue people have had. While recording the screen still shows the thin streaks, although they don't appear in the video. But really, its pretty annoying while filming.I rated it a two because it could be very good in theory...but the performance isn't up to snuff. I am going to get the creative vado HD.

I was also tired of the cumbersome transfer process that the miniDV devices made you go through.  So I was looking at a Flip until this came out.  I chose this one because I thought it would be neat to have still photo capabilities as well.  I've had it for a few months so far, and my impressions are as follows:1) The video quality is excellent and has surpassed my expectations.  The video can by shaky sometimes, but that's generally my fault and probably not surprising since I'm usually running after my children, but both in low light and outdoor situations, the image quality is usually quite sharp.  I would have liked an optical zoom, but it's important to remember that such things are against the spirit of these kind of cameras.2) The ease of use in terms of startup, recording, playback, and data transfer are all that I hoped for.  I also like the ease of hooking up to a TV to watch videos quickly.3) The still photo capabilities are spartan, so you should not expect to replace your regular still camera with this.  The shots are probably okay for facebook-quality pics,  but nothing beyond that.  It is 5MP, but the shutterspeed is slow, there is no flash, and no control over any of the parameters.In summary, it's a great mini-camcorder and I've been very happy with it so far.  Probably it's greatest feature is that it's small enough to actually take with you most places, and you will therefore get footage you wouldn't have gotten with your high-quality but bulky camcorder that you left at home.  I give it a solid 4 stars and recommend it.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8 - Bob's Review", "Author": "Knives Town \"- An online knife store\"", "ReviewID": "RAEJJA81UQUPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love shooting video but have never been fond of carrying around a camcorder which requires a camera bag on my shoulder or looking like an idiot with it around my neck. I had my eye on the Flip cameras since they came out and when I read other reviews that the Zi8 was supposed to be even better and slimmer too, I took the plunge. I am glad I did as I have been enjoying the new found video freedom this little unit provides and it has reignited all that I originally found so compelling about shooting video.The resolution is great! No one can lay a legitimate complaint against that. Some have complained about a whine in the mic or jerky zoom. I never had the mic problem, but yes on the zoom issue. My unit shipped with 1.03 software and the Koday website has already upgraded to 1.06. I downloaded that firmware and now the zoom is smooth as silk and never any whine in the mic. I put a 16GB class 6 Centon card in it and I get a good 2hrs on 720/60fps.I give high marks to this unit all around. I have not really found the EIS even necessary. Anyone who is experienced at shooting video knows SLOW movement is required whatever camera you are using unless you want to get nauseous watching your vids. I had already developed a slow, steady hand, so I just leave the EIS off. All the controls on the camera are very intuitive and the Arcsoft software on board is good.If I had to request an improvement on the next gen, I would ask for two things. First, I would like a better built in mic. Yes, it is great that you can plug in an external, but the purpose of owning this unit is to have a portable camera in your pocket you can pull out and have ready in an instant. If I have to do the external mic thing, then I am getting closer to might as well use the bulky old Handycam unit. I don't want a two piece camera, just one small hand-held that picks up good quality sound please.  The other item I might like to see would be better white balance handling. The unit will sometimes struggle with white balance and flare during the videos for no apparent reason.Other than that, I think it is fantastic and I do consider these issues nit picking, especially at a $150 price point. I can give a hands down recommendation for this unit.

Memory cards are anywhere from off-brand cheap to high-end expensive. After reading reviews, I decided on the moderately priced Kodak brand and went for the 8 MB card ($39.95 + free shipping at HSN as of Nov 09). You'll also want to buy a case, since the lens has no cap.The biggest disappointment is the zoom (digital not optical), which is very jumpy.

Solution: buy multiple batteries and swap them out. Other reviews said to turn off the autoshake to improve the battery.The picture quality and sound are not as good as my Flip Ultra. The Kodak does have a macro mode which my Flip doesn't, so you can get in close to read print with it, better than the Flip. I was holding both cameras side by side about 3 ft away - the Flip is sharper and the sound is better. The Flip does a better job autofocusing, keeping everything sharp, while the Kodak you have to make sure everything is in the same plane otherwise part of the picture is out of focus. The advantage of Kodak is that you can add an external microphone which should make the sound quality better than my Flip.I also bought a second Kodak at the same time I bought the first one and it would zoom in, but wouldn't zoom out unless I turned the camera off - defective.  So I'm not so sure about Kodak quality.  The ease of use of my Flip is better, but the Kodak is thinner, looks cooler, and has a fun joy stick.

Last Christmas I got her a Canon FS100 which was our first flash based camcorder. It was nice, but frankly I was a little disappointed in the picture quality especially when played back on an HDTV. It was stolen a few months ago, so my wife has been bugging me for a new one ever since. I decided I wanted to go HD this time. I started researching and most of the regular HD camcorders are over five hundred dollars which I really did not want to spend. I decided to look at the Flip UltraHD since it was under two hundred dollars.  I paid almost three hundred for the Canon FS100, so I was skeptical of these Point & Share HD camcorders for under two hundred. The Flip seemed like a decent option, but I didn't like the fact that it didn't take SD cards. The last thing I want is to be taping my son's birthday and then run out of space with no option to add a new SD card. Then I stumbled on to this Kodak Zi8 and I am soooo glad! I like it better than the FS100 which is more expensive.  Highly recommend!Other Note:I don't use the bundled software.  The movies are .mov which is Apple's format that uses Quicktime.  Since I use iTunes, I already had Quicktime on my computer so no problems for playback.  For importing the videos on to the computer, I use Picasa (Google's free picture managing software) which does video now too.  It works great and helps me organize all the videos the same way I do my photos.  Also, Picasa has a button that takes a still photo from the movie.  I LOVE this option because I don't feel like I need to take my point & shoot camera AND my camcorder.  I just use the camcorder and it is like having 30 pictures per second.

I explained that the software did not install.  She took my serial number.  She then told me that I would have to contact ArcSoft about the software since Kodak didn't have it.  This was Saturday and ArcSoft is open Monday through Friday.  In the meantime, I went to the ArcSoft site and (a) there was nothing there specifically for Kodak and (b) the free version of MediaImpression that was available only did photos, not movies.2. ArcSoft via telephone.  I told the fellow what the Kodak support person had told me.  He informed me that I would have to get the software from Kodak--they didn't have it.3. Kodak via online chat immediately after the ArcSoft phone call.  I gave the new tech support guy the case number of my previous call.  He eventually told me to download and install EasyShare software, a free Kodak software package.  I was using Firefox and could not get the online installation to work, so I confirmed with him that I was to download and install EasyShare, restart my machine, then once again attach the Zi8 for the ArcSoft installation.  I closed Firefox and opened IE.  I had to restart my machine, close everything, and then run the Cygwin installation of EasyShare.  I never received any indication that the installation was successful and, after yet another restart, could not find EasyShare on my machine.4. Kodak via online chat again.  The last tech support person read over the notes from the previous sessions and told me that I would have to get the software from ArcSoft.  I explained to him that ArcSoft told me to get it from Kodak and now Kodak was once again telling me to get it from ArcSoft and that that situation would not work.  He then said that I could use the MediaImpression CD that came with the camera to do the installation.  I told him that I did not receive any CD in the box and, in an attempt to actually get to the point where I was willing to keep the camera even with the terrible tech support I was receiving, asked him to send me the CD that I did not get.  He told me to go to the ArcSoft site and download the software--you know, the program that does pictures but not movies.So, I got a return label from Amazon and will ship it back for a refund tomorrow.

Lemmonds \"Kit Lemmonds\"", "ReviewID": "R6K55F87LPSWX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The good:1) 720p 60fps is the best shooting mode and is tolerable in bright light2) unit fits in pocket if you could protect the lens somehow3) decent battery life4) hdmi5) offers many options (but none are implemented well)The bad:1) inexcusably horrible software package meant to bilk customers out of more money2) glitchy performance - especially for facial detection3) compression leaves numerous artifacts (cross-hatches) in video (should have option of shooting uncompressed)4) no lens cover and this unit attracts lint like a magnet5) poor lens choice for personal shooting6) micro mode is a good idea, but poorly implemented7) saves to .mov files8) do not even think about shooting in anything but full, bright light.9) wonky wiggle-stick button for most functions10) still camera is uselessThe specs look nice for this camera - four shooting modes (1080p, 720p-60fps, 720p-30fps, wvga), panorama and micro modes, facial detection, electronic image stabilization, but none of these options are implemented particularly well.  I would have preferred a single shooting mode as long as it offered sharp images in average light.  And why include a still camera feature if the resulting images are worse than cell phone pictures from years ago?  It seems like Kodak was more concerned with the spec sheet than performance.  Perhaps they were wanting to compete with the flip cameras.  Ironically, the mediocre performance from the Zi8 positions it closer to the $99 aiptec hd cams you buy at Walgreens.HD claims have to be taken with a grain of salt for these little cameras.  They may record in HD, but if the sensor can only detect blurry, chunky images than you're just recording every detail of a bad image.  For the money, you would probably be better off with standard definition from a better sensor.The lens choice for the Zi8 is puzzling.  The depth of focus makes no sense for personal shooting.  They were nice enough to include panorama & micro modes - but the depth of focus on micro is 5 inches, so you're camera is right in someone's face and you'll only catch their eyes and part of a nose.  Panorama makes more sense, but everything close is blurred.  If you're shooting in anything less than full sunlight (ie - anywhere indoors), everything is kinda blurred anyway.  Zoom is absolutely useless and I'm not sure why they even bothered; if something cannot be implemented well, it shouldn't be implemented at all.The Zi8's worst limitation is that it's crippled by a horrible software package and file format.  I chose this camera because it stores video to SDHC which my televisions read.  All of my dvd players play divX video, so I planned to convert all files to divX disks for ultra-long playback.  Unfortunately - when I started trying to work with the files this camera produces I found that the device was hobbled to ArcSoft MediaImpression software.  You'd think this software would allow you to convert your videos - and it kinda does...to other .mov resolutions.  To remedy this - I went to the arcsoft site to download the necessary codecs and quickly found that this was one of those \"bait and switch\" software houses that only exists because they make exclusivity agreements with hardware makers.  The software itself cannot compete with other software and only exists because the hardware buyer has no choice.  When you go to their site you're bombarded with offers to \"upgrade\" your software for a measly $60 charge (almost half the cost of the camera).  Thinking that they still might have codecs, I registered and they sent me a confirmation email. But the confirmation link was bad and I had to manually set it to a valid address.  Then - the support form bombed on another error!  Did the same people who coded the site code the horrible software?  It sure seems like it.Keeping everything in perspective - the Zi8 is not a horrible camera for $150, but it's not particularly good either.  The camera's mediocre performance makes it better situated for a $99 price point.  I've learned a valuable lesson about specs vs performance.  I'm considering returning the Zi8 for a camera with a better lens & sensor - even if it's standard definition, and I may avoid Kodak products in the future.  Any hardware maker that makes these greedy Faustian bargains with inferior software houses to try and bleed more money from their customers does not deserve customers at all.  I will definitely never buy another product bundled with ArcSoft garbage-ware.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect...", "Author": "B.

Knowing my wife and I would want to make sure to have something we could grab quickly to record the many \"catch it now or you won't see it again\" moments as our new arrival grew older, I decided to drop the money on a handheld camcorder. As a caveat before I get into the details, let me say that it is pretty incredible that you can cram all the tech needed to build a camcorder into a device this small. However, let me also say that's not necessarily a good thing in this case.Of course, the first thing you do with a new device is to set it up. That proved fairly easy. I wanted a camera where I could make minor adjustments needed for the different scenes I might encounter while being easy enough to operate that my wife (who hates menus and tech) could still press two or three buttons and have the camera recording from a dead stop. If you want anything more complex than some simple brightness and quality adjustments, you're out of luck - this is obviously a camera designed for the non-technologically inclined - but the menu system is pretty eazy cheezy.Once you start recording with it, one problem becomes immediately apparent. Without a tripod, and regardless of how the image stabilization is set up, the results from this camera are shaky shaky. Doesn't matter how you try to stabilize it (and I tried so many different ways I lost count) - holding it in your hand stabilizing your elbow, holding it in both hands, laying down on the floor holding the camera out in front of you - it doesn't matter. I was firmly convinced the \"image stabilization\" was a meaningless tacked-on feature meant to fool the unwary so I turned it off just to see - and it reached even more frightening heights of jitterbugginess (technical term) :). So when it comes to this camera, don't even think about ordering it without a tripod (which I had to immediately order after trying to use it without one).As for the much over-hyped \"720 HD\" resolution, somewhat of a laugh and a snort from this reviewer on that. I play 720p and 1080p HD video games all the time and watch full HD movies both on a projector and a Sony TV and this 720, while it seems to genuinely be 720 resolution, still looks pretty crappy.So, after getting the tripod set up and recording a few videos of my kid (mainly looking around and drooling since he was like three months old at the time) I figured \"Hey, let's get a movie put together and post it on YouTube for the grandparents!\" (a feature prominently tooted about on the packaging of the camera - YouTube, not the grandparents). Connecting the camera to the computer was easy (USB to USB....pretty simple), but I encountered my first icky surprise after dragging and dropping all the movies to my computer.This camera records everything in a format called .MOV. Which neither Windows Media Player nor Windows Movie Maker can actually play. In fact, curiously enough, despite the FOUR OTHER PROGRAMS I downloaded from the Internet just trying to WATCH the movies, it seems nearly no other program except for their included ArcSoft Media Impression for Kodak DOES actually work with .MOV format files.Not bad, I figured - tech can be annoying. I loaded up the included ArcSoft Media Impression for Kodak software the camera came with and after some irksome updates, got it opened and running. Turns out the ArcSoft program has a few even more annoying \"features\":1. Crashes about every thirty minutes (if not sooner)2. Takes anywhere from fifteen to forty five minutes to convert .MOV files into something any other software can actually run.3. When you actually try to string together video clips to make a movie, the program acts like you have beaten it with a Glitch Stick and promptly spasms, collapsing in a puddle of electronic goo and refusing to function.As the ultimate Fatality to compound the frustration, the video camera on my Android phone (which, incidentally, cost me only $150 out of pocket) not only records videos easier (even 720 HD ones), saves them in the easy to use MP4 format, but also can upload my videos straight to YouTube right off my phone. So if Kodak, who has been around for decades, can't make a standalone device that works half as well as the video camera built into my phone (which does a thousand other things too) then I would say things are in a sad state when it comes to optical electronics (aka cameras). You're probably asking at this point why I gave the camera two stars. It got two stars simply because it is capable of recording video and doesn't literally explode when you turn it on.Now, over a year after my son was born, I decided (foolishly) to take this camera along to record his first birthday party. Like an idiot I assumed it would make more sense to use the actual video camera we owned to record the birthday party instead of using my phone. Boy I wish I had used my phone. For \"fun\" I started tracking how much time it's taking me - as I write this review (burning time as I wait for the ArcSoft program to convert my MOV files to something usable) I've crossed over into the seventh hour now attempting to get these videos to something usable. And that's not even counting the other videos I have archived in .MOV format that I still have to go through.In conclusion, don't buy this camera unless 1. It's 20 bucks, 2. You're brain dead, or 3. You really like tormenting yourself and are looking for a new low in agony. :)", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but keep files small.", "Author": "Larry Stuppy \"larstup\"", "ReviewID": "R7N03EPGOKHL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera after trying another brand and having to return it for poor quality.

A great Amazon price.CONS: 1)The camera powers down automatically after a few minutes even when it is on the AC power adaptor. Unfortunately, powering back on resets all \"Setup\" values back to their defaults.  This can be annoying between takes when using an external mike when you set the mike record value to the maximum value.  2)The in-camera speaker is almost worthless. This is very annoying when trying to do sound checks (there is no headphone jack).Hints: 1) Long-time videographers know that no camera can be used to do fast panning.  If you want to pan, always do it very slowly. Image stablization cannot overcome the effects of a fast pan, it it only designed to minimize minor shaking in a hand held situation.  2) Buy a spare battery and keep it charged. I get about 2 hours off a fresh recharge. 3) Take it with you for still photos too. The HD format makes nice photos even if they aren't 5 Mpixel. 4) When recording normal speaking voices over 6 ft away, I reccommend using an external mic, just be sure to power it on if it uses a battery.

My sister has a Flip and I was looking for something similar to replace my Canon digital tape camcorder which crapped out after many years.  After reading the predominantly glowing reviews both here and in the trade magazines I thought I'd try Kodak even though they're not know for their digital cameras.  After playing with this camera for a few days I think it will fit the bill although I guess I expected a little more based on the rave reviews.Controls are basic, easy to use, easy to access, and easy to understand.  Good thing because documention is pretty sparse.  More on that in a moment.  I especially like the ability to quickly and easily choose between the different video resolutions.I'm a little disappointed at the quality of the still imagery however.  Sure it's a 5 megapixel camera but don't think it will replace your digital point and shoot.  The lens is just not there and there's virtually no settings to adjust.  It is what it is.  The images aren't bad but have a vague opaqueness to them.  Clearly not on par with what you might be used to.The camera includes an HDMI (and composite video) cable which is a nice touch and allows for a direct connection to the idiot box.  Can't pass judgement on the battery life yet but recharging it is no harder than charging a cell phone with the included AC adapter/charger.  Thanks Kodak for not making us have to go out and buy them.The current firmware of the camera (available in the tools menu) is version 1.06 (as of 9 Feb 11).  If you're running something earlier than this there's a firmware patch available on line.  I can't say much for the User Guide that comes with the camera as it really doesn't explain in more than a few words what the features are used for or how to get the most from them.  The User Guide itself references an \"Extended Users Guide\" available at the Kodak site online and provides the link . . . but the link is broken.  I found the \"extended\" guide elsewhere at Kodak as a .pdf file and it's just a rehash of the basic User Guide.  I would have liked to have seen a chart showing how much memory is used per minute with the different resolution settings.  That would help with deciding how large an SDHC card to get.  Speaking of which, you definitely need an external card as the onboard memory is negligible and regardless of what size you opt for you'll want one with no less than a Class 6 file transfer rate.The ArcSoft camera-to-computer software package that comes resident, well, it's a basic little package which would probably satisfy most users . . . if it only worked!  The media player (no big deal) and the video editor (a big deal) both load screens that don't fit on your (at least not on my netbook) computer screen, leaving the portion with the controls hanging off the bottom edge with no way to reach it.  This renders any editing or movie creation (including making DVDs) impossible.  I checked the ArcSoft User Forum and found three other complaints on the same issue in the last three months.  No excuse for this, ArcSoft (are you listening, Kodak?).One more little peeve:  Other reviewers mentioned the camera is a little slippery and a fingerprint magnet so I ordered the custom rubber sleeve sold here on Amazon as an accessory.  It greatly improves grip and has holes cut for all the entry and exit points save one, the USB-to-computer arm.  So you have to pull the camera out of the sleeve each time you need to dump video to the computer for editing (assuming of course you have something other than ArcSoft software).So to sum up, this looks like a nice, easy to use digital video camera.  The still camera capability isn't great, the documentation is a little sparse, and the editing software stinks.  But despite all that I think most users looking for an on-the-run compact camcorder that takes great video will be completely satisfied, especially for the price.FOLLOW UP:Heard from ArcSoft Tech Support that the Media Impression software that comes with the camera will NOT work properly unless your screen resolution is AT LEAST 1024 x 768.  Most desktops and laptops have this resolution (you may have to change your settings) BUT some netbooks do NOT have this minimum resolution.  If that's the case, the software will NOT function properly and you won't be able to edit or create movie clips with the ArcSoft software included with Zi8.  And apparently there are no plans to change this.

This is a great camera at a great price!!!I had one specific purpose in mind for this camera - I wanted to run from my audio mixer (XENYX USB1222FX) directly into the camera to capture the best audio possible (vocals & acoustic electric guitars).  The external mic jack makes the Zi8 PERFECT for this application !!!  For those who may be thinking about doing the same thing - I used the CD/Tape Output on the audio mixer (RCA jacks) and ran directly into the external mic input on the Kodak Zi8.  Initially I was getting a lot of hum, but after some experimentation I eventually determined that the external mic sensitivity setting on the Kodak Zi8 needed to be turned down FOUR NOTCHES !!! Four notches looks like ALOT on the graphic representation of the sensitivity setting, but it did the trick perfectly - now I have crystal clear audio with a great HD pic in all my vids.(p.s., Don't forget to set the sensitivity EVERY TIME the camera is powered back on - the camera does not \"remember\" the mic sensitivity setting when the power is switched off.  I figured I'd pass this tip along since I discovered it the HARD way.)I am currently doing 99% of my vids in one location indoors (my in-home music studio) using a tripod & using AC to power the camera.  However, I did purchase a number of accessories I think everyone should consider for a complete Zi8 experience:  an additional battery, a separate AC / 12V charger, the black silicone protective sleeve, a larger capcity SD card, the CaseLogic TBC-312 nylon case, etc.  I'm sure as I venture outside (beach, boating, vacations, holidays, etc), these accessories will be important to fully enjoy the Zi8 experience !!!Great camera - buy one today !!!(One final note:  The first Zi8 I received would not charge through the power jack due to a short in the power jack (female - camera side vs male - cable side).  This was quite evident by an intermittent power light /power LED at the slightest touch of the jack.  NO WORRIES !!!  Amazon.com was fantastic - they immediately shipped me a new Zi8 which arrived in 2 days. After MUCH seraching online I could NOT find evidence that this is a known or recurring problem with the Kodak Zi8.  Therefore, this would NOT deter me from purchasing the Zi8 again as a gift for family & friends.

It's small and portable, it shoots 1080p, it has a removable battery, and the kicker for me is the external audio input.For me, the ability to plug in a microphone makes all the difference and I think puts this camera ahead of all others. The biggest problem with a lot of video these days is the atrocious audio. The built in mic on this camera isn't actually that bad, it's better than most other similar HD cameras. But if you're shooting an interview nothing will compare with plugging in a lav. I also bought the Sony ECM-DS70P and used an L bracket that I bought at Radio Shack and it works great.One of the downsides is the menu navigation. It's kind of wonky and certainly not the most intuitive layout I've ever used. It's passable and definitely not a reason to skip this camera. I guess it's more of an annoyance than anything.Overall, the footage this thing shoots looks great. The 720p 60fps mode looks really good, it's a really nice option if you're moving the camera a lot. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who's looking for an affordable, portable HD camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Professional, But Close Enough", "Author": "Rosie M.", "ReviewID": "RHRMK3BOF50DZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kodak Zi8 looking for a camera that could make good videos. I didn't want it to make short clips of concerts or my friends dancing like the advertisement depicts, but I wanted to make movies that were short (5-15 minutes), and that were a good enough quality to post on Youtube. This camera definitely serves that purpose. The image stabilization makes the picture a little less jumpy, but one of the main things I thought was great was the microphone jack. The microphone that is built in to the camera is totally crappy, you really can't use this camera with out another microphone. I hooked a cheap one up (from the dollar store), and it worked perfectly. I also liked that I could adjust the volume of the microphone using the settings menu. The macro setting is pretty decent, however it cannot go as close as one might imagine (only about six inches away). I would also recommend that if you are going to be using the macro setting a fair amount, look into getting a removable macro lens. Once again, I made one by using a jewelers/geology magnifying glass, and it worked perfectly. Another thing that the Zi8 lacks is a low-light setting. If you're going to be shooting in the dark, a higher-end camera would work better. The still-photo camera that is built into the Zi8 is actually pretty decent, taking pictures that don't look like the crappy stills you get from a Flip (although with a Flip you have to take a video and then take a picture with the software from the video).  And, as I mentioned before, this does have image stabilization, however if you want something to really look pro, you'll have to buy a tripod (I bought one, also from Amazon, for about a dollar). The one thing I really don't like about this camera is the memory. IF YOU'RE BUYING THIS CAMERA, YOU MUST ALSO BUY A MEMORY CARD. The camera comes with about nine seconds worth of video, which isn't much time. Overall, this camera is great. I would definitely recommend it for the newbie, and it is much better than the Flip, in almost all aspects. For the money, it's a great little camcorder.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Remarkable for the price.", "Author": "Michael Watters", "ReviewID": "R2S17Z0Z237OEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I lot of the negative reviews regarding the video quality are probably due to either a computer with an older processor or video card, or the use of a SDHC card that has too low of a rating. You will need a SDHC card of at least a 6 rating in read/write speed in order to adaquately record HD video on this device. Older computers can have a lot of trouble displaying the HD video properly.Also, the low-light capabilty of this recorder isn't very good. Put some light on the subject or scene if you want the best video possible. Buy a $30.00 camcorder LED light unit like I did and you should be good-to-go. I recommend an external microphone, which is a VERY nice feature, although the internal mic is OK for many occasions. Note that you can get stereo sound from an external mic, but only mono sound from the internal microphone.The software loads off of the device itself -- no CD. It's pretty simple to use, but doesn't have a lot of features. It will allow almost instant posting to YouTube, etc. which is a nice addition.On the slightly negative side, the door to the SD card slot is remarkably flimsy and delicate, and can be broken or lost easily. The lens does not have a protective cover. I use a small rubber band  around the body to hold the puny SD door in place, and cover the lens with an optical lens cleaning cloth when storing or transporting. Don't drop the unit on a hard surface!You probably won't be filming a major motion picture with the Zi8, but for casual and excellent video recording it is exceptional.

I mainly use it in the daylight and i can fix the lighting issues with editing software. The image stabilization on the camera works well as long as you do not use the zoom, and yes everyone says the video quality is lacking when the zoom is used and that is because it is digital and not optical, so it only blows up pixels. I have used the face detect feature but i cannot tell the difference whether it is on or off.

I suggest reading the instruction manual to learn how to use it first!  However, once I grasped the concept, I was able to easily use it to take fantastic video pictures.  It also takes stills.  It has its own USB cable tucked away, so it's simple to upload video.  The quality, even on the low settings, is excellent!  It has image stabilization, too, a great feature to prevent shaky video.  I bought my camera refurbished for well under $100 and it's the way to go!  My biggest complaint is that, as CNET review states, it shows fingerprints all over the camera, leaves smudges.

IT gives you the ability to film 1080p films in the palm of your hand. You can also select 720p video at 60fps (frames per second), or 30fps, and you can also take pictures as well.--The picture quality is pretty good all things considered, It is by no means on par with a DSLR camera or something in the 12+ mp range, but it is fine if you just wanna take some quick snapshots with your friends.-You may also record videos in standard definition if you want to, I'm not sure of the fps, but it does a decent job, especially if you have a smaller memory card, and you are wanting to conserve space.--The 720p/30fps mode is a nice addition for those looking for the slower framerate, but I personally don't get much use out it.--The 720p/60fps option is, in my opinion, the best mode of them all. You get the high resolution 720p picture, with the smooth 60fps look. The picture quality is wonderful. Much better than the Flip hd in my opinion. That's not to say that the Flip hd is bad, I just feel that the Kodak Zi8 is a better buy.--The 1080p/30fps option is also a good option on this camera, and is one of the selling points of this camera. While the framerate will not be the super smooth 60fps, 30fps still provides stunning video quality.--The image stabilization on this camera is not the best, actually its really not that helpful. It's really not necessary when you're using a tripod or when you have a steady hand.--The usb out is nicely tucked away into the camera's side. While the cord itself is VERY short, a USB extender cord will be VERY helpful, if not necessary for this. Luckily, they are cheap and easy to come by.-- Really this camera is just about everything I could ask for in a mini hd camcorder.

I am simply amazed at the video quality for such a cheap camcorder.  This is my first HD camcorder (except for my T1i DSLR).  I searched around for reviews on which pocket HD camcorder to get for a good 3 weeks until I finally decided on the Zi8.I finally decided on the Zi8 for a couple of reasons.  1.  External mic opportunity  2.  The ability to use my own memory cards (up to 32gb)  3.  I thought the picture quality was better than that of the comparable Flip models when watching over 100 different videosThe results I have got so far are absolutely wonderful in my opinion.  There are a couple of things I suggest you steer clear of.  1.  Low light.  This isn't a $5,000 camcorder.  Like most other \"cheaper\" camcorders the Zi8 does not like low light at all.  It's best to be outdoors or in a well lit room.  2.  Don't zoom.  The Zi8 only has digital zoom.  It does not have optical zoom.  When you use the digital zoom you can most definitely notice the picture degrading.There are some things I don't like about the Zi8 or wish it had.  For one, the lens is always exposed.  This can cause dust, smudge, fingerprints, etc. to get on the lens.  If you watch the video I posted you will notice a smudge in the upper right hand corner of the video when the bonfire is going.  Since the camera is so portable and easily gets put into your pocket, it's quite easy for it to get dirty.  I don't want to carry around a camcorder bag as the whole purpose of getting such a small camcorder was it's portability.  With that in mind, I did buy a small neoprene carrying case for it, but it's a little bulky in my pocket now.  I just wish there would have been some kind of lens eye that would open and close when in use or not in use.I haven't been able to get the software that is preloaded on the Zi8 to install on my PC.  I am running Vista 64-Bit and meet all the requirements listed.  Since I already had video editing software loaded on my PC I didn't care too much about it not working.  Although from reading other reviews, apparently the software on the Zi8 is absolutely worthless anyway.  I would suggest purchasing your own video editing software.As far as the layout of the Zi8.  It's extremely easy to use and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to change the settings.  There's really nothing you need to know to make it work better or more efficiently.  I pretty much left everything the same as far as the settings.  It has the option for \"face detection\" and \"image stabilization\" neither of which I believe work that well.  There is really no need for these to be on but it doesn't really change anything if you turn them off.Choosing which setting for video is a matter of personal preference.  I tinkered around with each and decided to leave it on 720p @ 60/fps.  This, in my opinion, gives the smoothest video at the best quality.  The 1080p option would be OK if you had the camera mounted on a tripod and were using it for a presentation of some sorts or recording something that didn't have a lot of movement.  The 720p 30/fps wasn't too bad.  You can notice the video and/or panning isn't quite as smooth.  This is why, like stated before, I always keep mine set at 720p 60/fps.  The video quality is awesome and when panning, either with a tripod or handheld, it looks smoother than the others.  You can see examples of this in the video.The sound on the Zi8 is very sub-par.  This is to be expected for a cheaper camcorder.  I definitely wasn't expecting great sound recording from the Zi8.  It only has mono capabilities, BUT, you can plug in an external mic.  I purchased a Sony ECM-DS70p off eBay for around $4.  This exact mic sells for around $40-$50 on Amazon.  I have yet to test out the mic outside, but inside the sound is vastly improved.Overall, I am extremely happy with the Kodak Zi8.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well priced HD pocket camcorder.  You really can't go wrong with it.  Just keep a steady hand and you'll have great results.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8 vs. Flip MinoHD", "Author": "Stephen Evans", "ReviewID": "R2SB5J7J2AJG2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have both the Kodak Zi8 and Flip MinoHD at work. When buying one for home use, I chose the Kodak Zi8. The image quality is much better. I like the microphone jack on the Kodak as neither of these cameras have great microphones. Image stabilization is better on the Kodak if the zoom is not used. On both cameras, a steady handheld image is nearly impossible when using the zoom. I like the included editing software too.This is such a good product, the shortcomings are really disappointing. To keep the cost down, the Kodak comes with almost no memory. When adding in the cost of buying a memory card, this is a more expensive camera than the Flip. I wish this recorded mp4 instead of Quicktime. The base of the camera is rounded, precluding the possibility of setting this camera on a table while recording - which can be done with the Flip. If you have a laptop with a USB port exactly where the one in the Kodak instructions indicates, then the USB connection on this camera is convenient. Otherwise...I have to prop up my computer, turn my camera upside down, and use other objects to hold the camera in the awaward position needed to connect this camera to my computer. Wish the editing software included some free stock music like the Flip software has. Many of these design flaws seem so obvious, I am hoping Kodak will fix them on a newer model soon. Despite knowing these flaws, I still bought this over the Flip MinoHD.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "D-Stylz", "ReviewID": "R3BTVVC4PCG6BE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I initially looked at the Flip camera, but after reading multiple reviews there were a few things that led me to the Zi8.1)The use of a memory card does not necessitate downloading often as I can just put in another SDHC.2)The usb port exists within the camera and it's so easy to plug into my PC.3)The price was great!4)It films at 720p/1080p and easily uploads to YouTube/facebook etc.5)It comes with the proper HDMI cable which makes watching it on your TV very easy.

It seemed like for a long time they were playing catch up with other companies which were doing digital things better then they were. Like Epson Printers and Nikon Digital cameras for photographers looking to make the transition from film to digital during the infancy of this movement.I was looking for a pocket sized video camera that had more features, better quality, and was easier to use for transferring videos to the computer then my cell phone. I got that and more with this camera. It has a good weight to it (not heavy and not a feather) the controls are intuitive and capturing a clip is a snap. I had gotten a Flip and just wasn't pleased enough with it to justify the cost. The Zi8 seems worth the price and more.The wall charger, cable, and socket on unit itself, don't seem as sturdy as they should. In fact I had to return the first unit I got because it appeared that the socket's solder connection was bad and the connection was spotty. The replacement unit I got the next day from amazon was much better and felt more solid. I think the first one was just a lemon in that respects. Considering that it charges from the computer when it is plugged in means that there are 2 wholly separate ways of charging the unit. Considering this is my biggest complaint and amazon took care of it within 24 hours I am happyBattery life seems decent but charging seems a bit slow but having battery pack is a good trade off. I would suggest buying a back up battery to slip in your pocket but that might just be me liking to be prepared.The supplied editing software (ArcSoft) is a good place to start but I am pretty sure there are other video editors that will be more robust if you need to do more then put clips together and add some transitions to smooth it out.Over all I am very pleased with my experience and glad that I listened to the reviews that put this unit above the Flip and the Sony Bloggie (dumb name).

Bummer!Just finished playing some initial test videos on my 50\" Samsung via the HDMI cable. Absolutely awesome for such a small form-factor \"economy\" camera. I could not be more happy.

Hall \"pianoforall.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3OR90URI1YF4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read ALL the reviews from many sources and I STILL wasn't prepared at just how dark the movies come out. VERY dark indoors!! You know the way most cheap camcorders nowadays compensate quite well for low light - the zi8 doesn't AT ALL. It's a bit of a shock. I know it's not meant for low light but it's still a shock. You can lighten the image to an acceptable level with MPEG Streamclip (great free software) but I'm sure a lot of quality is lost already.Even outdoors the movies are dark - when you shoot on a bright day (not sunny) it ends up looking like a miserable day. Look at the examples on youtube and you will see this dark feeling in most.Another unforseen 'problem' is if you wanted to do video diary type clips (which a small camera is perfect for) you have no idea if you are in frame or not because there is no viewfinder that swivels round - and the lens doesn't have much of an angle to play with - if you stretch your arm right out and try to record yourself you just about get your head in. Needs a wider angle lens.More CONS - Slow to start up and lens unprotected if you have no case - still camera not great.PROS - great size - great movie quality if on a tripod and plenty of light - great price - ext mic socket - easy to use and to transfer images.I got this because I tend not to use my bulkier Canon HV20 much when I'm just out and about - and I wanted something that was small with HD. Now I'm thinking that a smaller pocket size camcorder with a better, bigger lens, turnable viewfinder, better image stabilisation and so on might have been better - I'm seeing now that the zi8's main advantage is that it's the size of a phone (I'm going to keep it for that reason) - but that is also where the drawbacks lie too. Think before you buy what it is you really want.Remember - don't expect to like the results until you have brightened them in some editing software. Mac users using Final Cut Express - Open your clips directly from the camera (which appears like a hard drive on your desktop) into MPEG Streamclip. Then Export as Quicktime movie - 100% quality - compression AIC (Apple Intermediate Codec) before you click on Make Movie open 'Adjustments' and put the brightness up to the next level - you can PREVIEW the results to see what it looks like - if happy cancel the preview and then make movie.

The video quality on the Zi8 is great. There are only 3 negatives we can really make about this camera and others have already mentioned them.The mic - Audio is not this devices strong point. But you can use an external mic. We haven't tried an external mic yet since we can live with the lower volume audio most of the time.Movement can cause shaky video - After reviewing the current line of mini camcorders, this is a pretty common issue. Especially when speaking of the HD units. While this is noticeable in videos, those saying the video is not watchable are going a little far. Video quality is still great. Of course, if you are running with the unit and shooting video, you may make your audience motion sick. So get to a comfortable position and shoot your video. Or prop the unit on something to shoot your video.Zoom feature - The zoom is good, but it does only zoom in increments. There is no option to gradually zoom in to a scene. This needs to be improved.With the bad points mentioned, we are very happy with this unit. We use it for home video, sports events, and other such uses. The video is crisp, clear, and well worth the price. It fits in pockets or purses very easily. It is very light. And the features all work well.

Every time you stop filming a separate segment is created, and you must key up each of these segments to show them. This makes for a stop -start home movie show. Therefore, you must have the remote. Otherwise, your out of your chair every few minutes.Be sure and purchase an extra battery. The life, particularly with the EIS on is perhaps 25 minutes. Overall this is a great handy camera.

There have been grumblings about a high pitched whine, but I didn't get that effect out of the box. Just the same, Kodak has a firmware update that addresses this and adds a few other nice tweaks to the operation of this camera, one of which is a smooth rather than stepped zoom. Easily installed, so I did it.Here is what I've experience so far with the Zi8.* Good battery life, over 1:40 on a fresh charge recording 720p at 60 frames per second. I got more out of the Zi6, but almost two hours is nothing to sneeze at.* Sound is good and dare I say similar to the Zi6. I cannot wait to try the external jack.

Did I mention I had stabilization on when testing the battery?* Awesome screen! It's big, clear and sharp.* 1080p? This is not the feature I bought it for--oddly enough--but in my tests it worked perfectly. Perhaps useful for videos that max out the digital zoom.* Uploads quickly to the computer. Quicker IMHO than the Zi6. Wonder why?* Takes SC memory cards--the new tape of the digital age as prices drop. 8Gb got me about 1:15, recording 720p at 60fps.* Good build quality, complete accessories which included complete video cabling, power supply and a wrist strap.* HDMI connection. The only way to watch your 1080p video IMHO.Over all, a nice upgrade/addition to the Kodak pocket video camera line. The price Amazon had it at was way too good to resist.

This is something that you will pick up as soon as you own one.For the price, portability, and functionality, I don't see why average users like me should not go with this Zi8. As a previous owner of Canon HV20 camcorder, all I can say is: I don't really feel there is any significant difference. Of course, I don't say this as a professional. The professionals will be able to tell you the differences. In short, if you consider of using Zi8 for home, outdoor, travel, and other casual uses, or even for family memories, you have come to the right product.

I haven't had a Kodak product in 30 years, this one is great.I had the Flip Mineo HD Camera. Returned it to [...] when I heard about this camera.  The large screen on the back is great especially compared to the Flip.  The Camera has 4 video modes, I only use the 720p/60 frames per second(fps) Mode.  That mode creates smooth Video compared to the 1080p/30fps.  Alright it's not 1080p but many of my high def cable channels come in 720P and they look good.  Another good feature the Zi8 has over the Flip is that the lens is recessed so it is more difficult to smudge or scratch, the Flip lens protrudes.The bad:  No optical Zoom (what do you expect it's $180).  The finish of the camera is glossy, smudges easy and can slip out of your hand, use the included wrist strap.  Memory card not included, get at least 8gb thats good for over an hour at 720p/30fps.The camera is preloaded with ArcSoft MediaImpressions for Kodak.  Don't know how that works, I have an iMac.

I first considered the Flip cameras, briefly considered the Creative Vado, but when I learned about the Kodak Zi8's external (stereo) microphone input and external SD storage, that sold me. The fact that it does 720p/60fps and 1080p/30fps was a bonus. I paid $139+tx at Best Buy.I'm a musician and audiophile, so I'm sort of anal when it comes to audio. I have some nice (Sony) stereo mics I use with other audio/video recording devices, so I was also hoping to make some drumming videos for youtube. The video was fine and I ended up using closed mics and mixer to get real professional audio with the HD video, but I couldn't disable the dynamic volume compressor/limiter built-into the camera. And that kind of ruins the whole \"professional\" audio/video result not matter how good the video and audio source is.So it's been a great inexpensive camera for family/ad-hoc videos (samples at [...]l), but I wouldn't use it for recording a band, even with excellent external audio source/mics.Pros: Excellent video quality (even low-light), 5MP still camera, easy video upload/transfer, external stereo mic input, removable SD storageCons: 1080p has a narrower field of view than 720p, need an external wide-angle lens, minimal user controls (e.g. can't disable internal audio level compressor), EIS is not great and shortens battery life, crappy video editing software, can't be used as a webcam", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Has its niche...", "Author": "wadrad", "ReviewID": "RHRG9TOB76RIA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm traveling in Greece right now as I type this, having brought only the Zi8 to document the feta-feasting, Mythos-swilling, and bazouki-blaring experience.  Usually on scenic excursions like this I'll bring a little Sony CyberShot camera (old 3-megapixel model) and a JVC digital video camera that plays mini digital cassettes.  Being a bit more restricted for space and weight (thanks Ryanair!) I decided to see if my fairly new Kodak Zi8 could fill the bill for both.  It will take 5 megapix digital photos, and videos in the following modes: WVGA, 720p, 720p/60 fps, and even 1080p (full Hi-Def)And the results?Well, as long as lighting is good, this thing performs fairly well.  Plenty of sunshine here, so that's not usually a problem...at least during the day.  Want to take some evening pix?  That's a problem.  Not having a flash, the Zi8 uses only available light, and does so poorly.  Worse, the low-light pictures look really grainy, like it's a frozen still from a video feed.  In full light, pix are fairly clear, but the color isn't very vibrant, and neither the color nor the clarity seems as good as my old Sony CyberShot.Video performs ably, and the quality of the 1080p hooked up to our HD television is pretty dang impressive.  BUT, most folks aren't working in HD format for home movies, and even if you have the software and equipment to edit and work with it, many friends and families (mine anyway) don't have the hardware to watch and enjoy it, so I find myself mostly recording in normal WVGA mode.  Lastly, if you're a PC person, the video format (QuickTime favored \"*.mov\") isn't well-liked by some of my video-editing software, and I have to convert it before I can import it into my editor.Final thoughts:I bought this for about $160, and it's now down to $115 (new model must be coming out).  My other equipment, though performing better, takes up more space and in today-bucks would run about $300-400 to buy.  SO, if you want easy performance with a small foot print on space requirements for a fairly low price, this is pretty awesome.  I'm a little pickier about the quality, and like to edit my own video quite a bit, so it's a little less awesome for me.  Still, all in all, an easy 4-star rating.Oh yeah... a forgotten negative:  though there is a zoom, there isn't a focus feature on the camera other than a switch.  One setting is for \"infinity distance\" and the other setting is for \"about 15 centimeters\" distance (paraphrasing what the instruction book says).  The problem is NEITHER setting works for something about 2 feet away.  I've taken several photos at about the 2-3 foot range, and they're blurry using either focus setting.  I guess I could move back to about 6-8 feet and then zoom in to make it LOOK like I'm only two to three feet away, but that's kind of stupid.  SOOOOOOO...as long as things are well-lit, and further away than 4 or 5 feet, the Zi8 works great.  I just finished editing some footage of Greece in Sony Vegas, and I was really impressed by how it came out.  Granted it was a pain in the butt converting all the *.mov files before I could import them, but that's just one of the negatives weighing against the size and convenience...hence that 4-star rating.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8 Worth the money?

Ive owned a non hd flip a kodak zi6 and finally this. I was looking for something to replace my zi6 and managed to get this off cragslist for about 40 dollars. Compared to the zi6 its a modest upgrade. The zi6 is really outdated in video quality by today's standards. The zi8 improves on that and packs in more features. it can record in 1080p/30 fps, 720 60fps and 30 fps and WVGA. 1080p i didn't like too much as it zooms in more compared to the other modes. 720/60ps is good for quick action and sports but i found 720p 30 fps the best as that is pretty for web videos such as youtube and its actually what i use it for. A new feature that is included is the external mic jack. You can plug any 3.5mm mic in which can give you a variety of sounds depending on the mic. This is good for the go hard enthusiast and interviewing type i guess. The internal mic is mono and is very ok. You can adjust the mic gain input if you wish. The image stabilization helps a little bit but so much but its better than nothing. A tripod is this camera's best friend well you could say that for all the cameras in this category. Now those that are looking to do serious filming or capture perfect memories may want a well a real camcorder. This is a portable camera for catching the spur of the moment and its also good for vlogging. What i hated about this camera is it shoots in mov format. Kodak at the time may have not realized that mov is a mac format and unforuntately pc is still the majority so putting it in mov instead of say mp4 which is a more universal format may prove to be an headache for some (maybe most in this case). Fortunately i use a program called mp4 cam to avi which rencodes the mov wrapper to something humans can use.Now compared to the flip ultra hd. I found it came down to this.The flip has slightly better video quality but the kodak has slightly worse video quality but got it beat in features. An sd slot that can take up to 32 gigs, an external mic and choices of four video modes and it can shoot pictures but that is garbage. I know people say smartphones have replaced these little pocket camcorders. Im not sure i would want to use my phone for heavy duty filming and besides these things are cheap that if it breaks from falling no biggie. Now if that expensive iphone does that well thats a different story. And also a film recording is not the main purpose of the phone more like a feature.

or stolen. I love this camera! It has 2 different options for 720p video you can shoot it in 30fps or 60fps, and of course it also has 1080p and WVGA video modes. I have tried them all, and the one I use the most is the 720p/30fps. Since I got this I find myself filming more activities because it's compact and you can take it anywhere, and I use it more than my expensive camera (which I would get rid of if it wasn't for night-vision).There are a few products you can get that will make this camera even better:-You're going to want an inexpensive external microphone with a windscreen, because if you don't even a slight breeze can ruin a video. I got an inexpensive one on eBay and it works well and the sound quality is a lot better.-You can get an inexpensive lens that is wide angle and macro Kodak Wide Angle Lens and it will improve your video. Plus it is magnetic so you can remove it easily if you want to.-Get some back-up batteries. Again, I got some inexpensive ones on eBay and they hold their charge and are easy to swap out.-Get a silicon case (if you can find them) or a skin-it or something to help protect it. (this is just my personal opinion, I like to take extra care of my electronics because I like them to last)-Finally get a case to hold everything. Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case with Storage (Black) I use that case and it is a nice fit for the camera and it holds my 2 back-up batteries, the microphone AND and lens all in the same case and it can fit in your pocket! (would also hold the remote if you get that)Like I said, I really like this camera, if it recorded better in low-light or had some sort of night feature I would ditch my bigger more expensive camera and just use this one.**Some extra notes**A trick I've done to my camera, if you want to record in low light/at night I've taken a 3 led tap light (similar to these Fulcrum 3 LED 3-Pack Tap Lights) and attached it to the front with velcro (it fits perfectly on the front) and you can just tap it on if the light is too low for what you're recording, and if you attach it with velcro you can remove it whenever you want.You may also want to invest in an inexpensive mini tripod and the Kodak remote for this camera if you want to have steady video and not be forced to always hold the camera.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great HD camera but...", "Author": "S. Scheifley \"Texas Drummer\"", "ReviewID": "RYWX8E8I6UA5L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the record, I was one of the first to purchase the Zi8 back in August 2009.  It has been a decent camera to use overall.  I do love the picture quality.  It's not great under low light, but it does work well under normal lighting.  Image stabilization does work, but it's so so at best.  I mainly got this camera due to the external stereo microphone output jack.  I've been able to make very nice audio recordings using mini-stereo mikes to go along with the HD video.  However, my jack no longer works properly anymore.  I've done numerous tests, and all I now get is the left channel. The right channel either doesn't work or it just cuts in and out.  Believe me, I'm very annoyed about this.  The internal mic does sound okay, but it's still mono.  I've tried working with Kodak on this by updating the firmware, but it didn't correct the problem.  I also downloaded footage to several computers (MAC & PC based) - same results.  I've also tested the stereo mikes by plugging them into a mixer board, and they worked perfectly.  Kodak simply informed me that since my Zi8 is out of warranty, all I can do is send it to United Camera service center in Bensenville, Illinois.  It'll cost a lot just for them to look at it, and to me, it isn't worth it.  So I'll just keep what I got and settle for mono sound.  I'm not happy about it, but what can I do?  I've considered the Zi10 camera.  It's cheaper than what I paid for my Zi8 two years ago; however, Amazon reviews have been more negative for Zi10 vs Zi8.  I guess I'll just wait for the next big thing in video cameras before committing more money.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent HD pocket cam for the price", "Author": "John.p.williamson", "ReviewID": "R1IL629JYBLE63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used it on my trip to Antalya, Turkey and it records decent footage.

The Arcsoft software that comes with it is decent, it is useful for emailing the videos, will convert it down to a manageable size for emailing. Just dont use the best for email setting, unless you absolutely have to shrink it down that much. I use the custom setting and max it out and it seems to not take too much quality out of the video for when I want to email a video.

You do not have to be a video expert. You do not even need instructions to start capturing HD video. The menus and feature set are very simple and easy to use. Extremely portable, as small as a Blackberry or iPhone. I also like that it uses a removable SDHC and USB port; very convenient. The battery life is fantastic. I have had this camera for over two months now and have only had to charge it twice (and I have an infant that just started crawling, so I'm using it). Cool factor is high, most people think it's a phone or a small camera, but when they find out it's a HD video camera, they are impressed. The movie/video editing software is minimal, but it works well for most applications. I have created movies from video clips and photos, added titles, music, and transitions. Then exported it to a DVD and YouTube, and it works great. Another cool feature, is the movie software is on the camera, so there's no need for keeping track of a CD/DVD. You can plug into USB and install the software from the camera. Video is also great for the price. It captures HD 1080p @ 30fps and HD 720p @ 60fps. Comes with HDMI cable to plug directly into your big screen TV. It is important to note that the camera does not have it's own light source, so your video quality is only as good as the lighting in which you are in. With decent lighting, the camera takes excellent HD quality video. Overall, this product is well worth the money.

Video is great too, lots of positive feedback on YouTube. Recorded full band sets up to 35 minutes and ended up with 10 gigs full on my 16 gig card I got for this.

Check out the video on the link here from Chaos in Tejas 2011, includes daytime show and nighttime, far away shots and close up... lots of different lighting and audio scenerios: [...]My main con is the issue when zooming when it seems to darken but per a review below mine, I'm going to update the firmware and apparently fix that! Also the zoom button being the up and down click of the record button is kind of annoying for us with larger hands.. I accidentally stopped recording a few times by clicking record instead of zooming.Best pro is the fact you can go into the settings and change the limiter on the audio... perfect for bands. The bad thing is if you turn it off you have to remember to go back into settings to turn the limiter back down. If you own this device, it is under settings and it is the icon that looks like a microphone.Last thing, this works great just as an audio recorder. Again, I have an external mic and have never used it without that. I put it in my pocket and started recording it on video on VGA mode (because obviously the video doesn't matter if I'm recording audio) and just left it recording and then later took the audio out of the video and it sounds great.Great device!", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "kodak movie flip camera - good value", "Author": "Ivan Pless \"Barry\"", "ReviewID": "R2VZDTLDKPJ8KZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought this was a good buy when the flip disappeared.

I was surprised that the internal memory is so small. I took three still photos and tried to run a video at the 720 setting and I could only get 2 seconds before it turned off. I went on Kodak's chat help and found the people there were not helpful. They read off script, which I guess isn't surprising. The first person who 'helped me' said I should expect 22 minutes, but that it was 'recommended' that I get a memory stick. I kept saying 'but I only got 2 seconds' and that didn't seem to compute. When I tried a second person, s/he said that I should expect less than ten seconds of video unless I use a memory stick. Okay, I'm fine with a memory stick, but I think it should be CLEAR in the literature that it's not 'recommended' but required. The booklet says there's enough internal memory for a few test videos, but that's not the case, unless your test video is one second long -- or maybe my camera is defective.

I bought a Flip Mino HD for my wife 3 years ago because she loved totake movies but couldn't figure out all the settings, etc.  The flip fit thebill quite well, but started developing problems with the off/on switch.  Iwanted to be sure that we had a pocket recorder for some upcoming travels soafter reading reviews on all the top selling video camera's, we selected theKodak Z18.  The Kodak was half the price of the original flip, but when youadd the price of the data card and a spare battery it starts to get a littlemore expensive.We compared video taken with the Flip and immediately after with the Kodak setat 720P.  The Flips picture was much better in lower light settings.  The Kodakequalled the Flip's quality when set at 1080P, but I understand at that settingwe will use up the battery and memory space much quicker.  The major differencebetween the Flip and Kodak so far is the lousy sound produced by the Kodak.While I had read that sound was a problem, I didn't realize how bad a problemit was.  In fact, had I known, we would not have purchased the Kodak.  I knowyou can hook up an external mike to the Kodak, but we bought this camera forsimplicity's sake, not to mess around with hooking up a mike each time we use it.I took a guess at the battery life since our use will be at the 1080P setting.In summary, the Kodak Z18 is fairly simple to use, takes very good video at 1080P,image stabilization doesn't add much, but we like the easy to use Zoom.

The optional remote control sealed the deal for this pocket video camera. Even if the videos or pictures weren't perfect the convenience and accessories would make up for it. However the videos are great for the price, the sounds syncs up perfectly, and it has a digital zoom which is not extremely effective but does exist, without the mechanical noise (and effectiveness)of a lens zoom.I purchased a mono external microphone (ATR3350) and it worked perfectly once I adjusted the microphone volume on the Zi8 (remember the Zi8 will NOT provide extra power to your mic if it requires it). There was a small ringing in the background of the video, not very noticeable and I suspect it can be remedied.I've read that for Mac users it's seamless with iMovie but Windows users may have more difficulty. If you have problems editing .mov files with your editing program, you may be a little frustrated. It works fine in CS4 if you got it. It also comes with a basic editing program (cut and filter) when you install the MediaImpressions media player (it installs when you first plug the Zi8 into your computer).I used a class 10 16gb SDHC card although a class 6 would work just fine.The Zi8 also shipped with the current firmware (1.06)The Zi8 also plugs right in to your USB port with it's built-in flexible USB plug. It also ships with an HD-video cord and audio cables so you can play video from it to your TV with sound. Use it with the optional remote and you have a nice little handy video player and card reader for your HDTV or projector.You can charge the battery from the wall, from your USB port to the charging inlet or even just plugging the Zi8 directly into the computer with that built-in USB plug.One negative thing was the poor still-picture quality. On the \"scenery\" setting, from a range of 3' to 20' indoors, in a brightly lit area, the images were quite bad (blurry), with or without the \"face detection\" or even the \"EIS\" which are some of the few settings options available. There is a handy macro switch which gives crystal clear images at exactly 6\" away at even low-light; but I'm unable to get images this clear using the other setting. I will experiment with the recommended light and distance; outside during the day, over a much farther distance.The extremely minimized settings menu was surprising at first, there are literally only 8 things to change:TimeNTSC/PALBrightnessAudio on/offMicrophone volumeEIS on/offFace-detection on/offRe-format SD card.All this makes it as easy to use as a phone camera. When you turn it on, you simply choose video size or still picture and start recording. A little zoom and that's all you get.

I wasn't expecting the best picture quality from this thing since I primarily use a Canon 7D for video but overall the pocket video camera has surpassed my expectations.The video camera is very easy to use and very straight forward.  The features are minimal but the secondary Audio In is a major plus since sound quality isn't that great on the built in mic.  Using it with my Rode Shotgun mic or my Zoom H1 gives the best sound quality.  It has a expansion slot for a SDHC and supposedly it will take up to 32GB of space.  That alone should bring customers away from other pocket cameras.  Picture quality is pretty good but it's no match for a Canon 7D or a 5D Mark 2.  For the price I paid for this camera, picture quality is pretty good.  The camera is about the same size as an iPhone 4 but almost twice as thick but it doesn't get in the way with portability.  The battery life is on par with any other pocket camera but amazingly, this thing charges really quickly.All in all, this is a fine camera for everyday use but don't think you'll blow away your friends and family.

This fact makes it tough to get good sound in many situations or even a shot.As for the editing: At first I converted the footage and tried Sony Vegas, WMM and even Magix. The quality was awful after hours of recoding with different specifications that I spent hours digging up from various different forums. Sony Vegas did work for a bit, but then just stopped for some reason (even after I tried 3 different tricks including the infamous, just rename the file format). Window Live Movie also worked for a bit. Flip camera is just so much easier to use!! I made such cute films in minutes with it.  This camera should come with the words MAC all over it.I have made 3 short films with the Arc editing software provided and was on the verge of crying a couple of times after it froze up (all other programs were closed) and then shutdown losing my entire movie. The way it saves edited clips makes no sense to me at all. I had to redo every edit. This has nothing to do with the camera, but I'd rather have the Flip for fun, sassy videos.So for reference, I have used the Flip and produced several videos from it (love it. so easy to use.), a professional camera/Canon GL1 (easy to transfer and edit) and I often shoot videos with my Panasonic Lumix digital camera (sound is not great but the video has a nice film quality - great in low light).I was very excited about the Zi8 - I bought a wide-angle lens for it; a Gorilla tripod to stick the camera all over the place (has been really fun); and the remote control was a great purchase too.As for focus: If you are doing interviews, then you can mic the person and move the camera away on a tripod though. I wanted to do some instructional videos for my business and have to get very creative - no holding anything up to the camera. Macro focus is cool, but not realistic. You need the mid-range focus, please!Cons:1. editing software is atrocious!! really drains your storage. Flip is a million times easier.2. Focus distance - such a shame.3. Unit overheats (gets very, very hot) and freezes up. This is a real pain.4. System also freezes up when card is not even that full - then you can't delete from the camera and must plug into computer, after removing the battery, because the unit will not power down (its frozen).Pros1. The video quality is amazing if you are at the right distance2. Far less shaky than the Flip, so the stabilization is working for me and I moved all over this Christmas taking video of the family and dog opening gifts (yes, the dog ripped open a gift), etc.3. Sound is quite good - though I think the Flip has the edge4. external mic rocks.5. the unit balances in your hand, making it easy to shoot.6. powers up quickly for catching moments.Bottom line -- This camera should be getting a better rating, but has been too much of pain for me. Maybe if I buy a Mac, I'll be very excited again, but I think Kodak royally messed up with the file format and Arc Soft as the editing software provider, along with the focus length.If I can't figure out the editing, I'll have to get rid of this camera soon.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best of the Best!", "Author": "Freakntweak", "ReviewID": "R25JZ24H7A0FE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing features for the price.

External mic input is very useful. I had to record an interview for a class project, and this camera did a great job. Although built-in mic is decent if you are recording something in a close-door environment, you are better-off buying an external mic if you are recording outdoor. Also electronic image stabilization is a great option, although it will suck up lot of battery. Image stabilization is not as effective when you moving around a lot, but it works great if you taking video while just walking slowly. Also I would recommend people get mini tripod, which is one of the best investment you will make.

I'm never the first on the block to buy anything electronic--I always wait until the service packs or equivalent come out--but the cnet and other reviews of this were so favorable that I bought one as soon as it was available at Kodak online, on 8/19/09.  I was not disappointed.The only cons I can find are that there is an annoying lag in trying to change menu options, and the menu set up is bizarre, and totally non-intuitive to me. I still have to think every time I change something about what I have to select to get to the option I want.It does take a while for the automatic light adjustment to take effect, which is most noticeable when you are walking around from place to place with different lighting. Some have complained about imperfect quality when moving, but I cannot complain; perhaps setting the quality to 720 instead of 1080 might have helped for them, but I have had no problem at all. I do notice that when trying to film something with varying light sources, there is noticeable pixelation on the bright part of the image:  in filming my parrot Ziggy and me playing in a corner with normal lighting next to a brightly lighted open window, the window frame is highly pixelated.  The Zi8 cannot do everything at once.The quality is so good that I can even get decent screen capture stills out of movie files (decent for me, an amateur--decent enough for the web, anyway.) It is difficult to take regular stills with the camera, though, because pushing the button inevitably shakes the camera.I personally find it annoying that the camera saves files in the mov format, but I can live with that.  I have several different video editing programs, but the easiest way to do rough edits on mov files is with Quick Time, so I had to buy Quick Time Pro to do that. I have several ArcSoft programs, and even bought an upgraded version of the oem version of Media Impression that comes with the camera, and it is useful for how quickly it loads previews for organizing.Some have complained about \"having\" to use Arcsoft software, but that's ridiculous.  I just ignore the ArcSoft software and pull the files off by cut and paste for later editing.  After plugging your camera into your pc, open My Computer, ignore the new hard drive, Arcsoft SW, that will show up, and open the new \"Removable Disk,\" which has folders DCIM and MISC in it, ignore MISC and open DCIM, and inside it will be a folder named 130EKZI8, which contains all your jpgs and movs, and you can pull them off the camera and put them on your pc by simple cut and paste, then edit them or convert them to your heart's content with whatever video program you desire--ArcSoft, Adobe, Magix, Pinnacle, Cyberlink, Vegas, whatever.  Some have complained about difficulty installing the non-necessary Arcsoft software, but I would complain either to Bill Gates or the manufacturer of their security programs about that.I have taken a number of videos of my parrots doing various things and posted them to my pwp and FB.  The pwp is accessible via my amazon profile, if you want to see what kind of quality the Zi8 delivers. I have also taken movies while driving--when I see odd behavior on the road, or unusual landmarks, or the scary \"runaway truck ramp\" signs on US 65, etc.--and the quality is 1000% better than any dashcam video I've seen on tv.NOTE:  If you want the best quality pictures, make sure that you keep your firmware upgraded.

If not for the \"issues\" I'll address here, I'd give the camera a \"4\" or \"5\". I'm experienced in photography, have my own photo gallery website on SmugMug, and shot VHS video years ago when my kids were growing up. I plan to keep this camera for the uses I myself have these days. It shoots good video, maybe just not terrific. But then after all, it's an inexpensive \"entry level\" camera.I had none of the problems some other reviewers had, maybe because my camera arrived with the latest 1.06 firmware. Directions for the camera are VERY limited. The included booklet, the Kodak on-line help, and above all, the ArcSoftware. Even going on-line to any of them gives sadly little help & direction for the new user. I clicked on help with ArcSoft and a GERMAN page came up, with no obvious way to get it into English. Is that stupid or what?! No corrections have been made by Arc days later, either.While I didn't expect video quality quite like the much more expensive camcorders offer, it was below what they seem to boast of and offer as examples. This camera really requires using \"Class 6\" SD memory cards. If not used the info from the camera shoots out faster than weaker memory cards can keep up with. That's when the camera shuts down or an error shows up. The camera's built-in mike records in \"mono\". For stereo you will need to purchase a stereo mike and plug it into the jack. Editing your video clips, it appears, will require purchasing additional software. At least my experience with ArcSoftware hasn't helped me there.Another issue I have is with its \"face detection\". This is a \"fixed-focus\" camera, the only choices being distance or close-up (5\"-12\") controlled by a switch on its top. How then can \"face detection\" even be possble? How can the lens find & focus in on faces, with a fixed-focus camera? It cannot and does not. A wasted \"feature\" it seems used in advertising. If I'm wrong, someone explain why.The reviews have been pretty good about this camera, in particular the one from cne*t. This may at this time be the best of its kind.

As I said, turn it on (and it comes to life quickly) and press the red button, and you are shooting high res videos.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy Happy.", "Author": "Sara B.

Portable.2. Very good video quality for this range of product.3. Very low price and good value.4. SDHC allows you to use as much memory as you wish.5. Image stabilization (See below) works pretty well.Cons:1. Battery life is dismal, only accepts proprietary batteries.2. Image stabilizer works alright, but could be much better. It is suppose to \"stabilize\" footage, but there is still massive shake and blur if you are not careful. I am very disappointed in this feature as Kodak could have done so much better.3. The HD mode is good, but the 60fps mode is much better and sharper.4. The USB plug is convenient, but is on a cheap piece of bendable rubber that I cannot imagine lasting long. The idea is to give you more angles to plug it in, which is nice, but it just seems non-durable.5. Still-camera mode is terrible and takes fuzzy pics.Overall: The pros outweigh the cons. For this low price, you are getting very nice video, even excellent at the right settings. Image stabilization, while not very good, still at least exists, and this is the only such product with that feature. Upload to my Mac could not be simpler: I did not even install any software. I just plugged it in and there it was on the desktop.

I am very happy with this camera. I have had this for about 6 months now and here are my pros and cons about it.Pros:- It has great picture quality. For the size and price of this i am very pleased with who the picture looks. Inside shots can look grainy on my computer but they look good when i burn it on to a dvd and watch on my tv.- It is very portable. I am to the point now where i throw this in my pocket with me every time just in case something exciting or interesting happens. I love the ability to be able to take this things anywhere. I have taken this with me to concerts to film the show and various other things like waiting in line, filming drunk people, and getting video of what the place looks like like. With this camera people usually can't tell i am filming them. It looks like i am holding a cellphone.- I like the ability to add things to this camera. I can buy extra batteries and extra SD cards which means there is no limit to how long i film. I have a 16 gb card and two batteries. I will go through two batteries and start running out of memory after filming for 40 minutes or so. Which isn't bad considering in most cases i don't have the camera on and film something for 40 minutes. I usually film a minute or two of something then turn it off and then repeat that till i run out of space. But again, if i am worried about that i can buy another 16gb card and another battery or two. I also like that there is an external audio jack or microphones.- The audio is great on it. On my computer i can everything really well but sometimes not so much on my tv. The concerts i have recorded have sounded and looked fantastic- USB. I like that the usb is built in and it doesnt take long to get the files on computer. It can charge through the USB as well. When i went camping for three days and had not outlets, i brought my laptop and used it to charge the battery and take the files off of my camera, which i loved.Cons:- Shaky video. Walking or moving around a lot with this makes the picture very shaky. I did notice that some of the shakiness went away when put the videos on dvd and watch it on tv. I try not to film while i am walking because it looks horrible. When i pan the camera around i do it extra slow to make sure it looks good. I highly recommend a tripod for this camera. People moving in front of the camera looks fine, the problem is when the camera itself is moved.- Add ons. While it can be great, like i mentioned above, it also sucks that i needed to buy so much extra. I got a mini tripod, regular tripod, extra battery, 16gb SDHC card, camera bag, light for night shots. It maybe a 150 dollar camera, but if someone doesnt have these extra features already and feels like they need them then it can get pricey- Software. The movies are in .mov format which sucks for windows. Like others have said it means that you can't make quick dvd's using Windows DVD Maker. I have a different video editing software which crashes when i use .mov files. So, i got something to convert .mov files to .avi files. That works fine but it is time consuming. I have to wait for the videos to convert to the right format, then edit them and then wait for the movies to be formatted to be burned.Overall, i would still recommend this to people. I love the picture quality and the fact that i am at least able to add on different things which you can't do with a FLIP. The camera is good for someone who is looking to shoot home movies and for someone who is looking for something portable. I have loved using this around the house, out camping, and going to concerts.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Completely Let Down", "Author": "pagreta", "ReviewID": "RRLWZ3WTQ3NZ6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I was truly excited for this item. I had done a lot of research of different models trying to get the most bang for my buck. It basically came down to a tossup between this zi8 and the Flip UltraHD. I decided to go with this model because of the removable storage. Let me start out with the good comments.Pros: This pocket cam is extremely easy to use. I'm pretty sure anyone can turn this on and figure out how to use it. The feature set of the camera is relatively small so you aren't overwhelmed with options. It boots up quickly and you're recording in no time. I like having removable storage so if I'm out on a long trip or something, I can take multiple cards and batteries and be able to record a lot. It is relatively small and although it is a little thick, I could still fit it in my pocket, or more comfortably, a purse. It does have a convenient usb connection that flips out on the side so you can plug it in. As far as the pros, that is about it.Cons: I bought this flip camera not only for the convenience and portability, but also to be able to record good quality video. Like the title says, I was completely let down by the quality of video this thing shot. I was so excited when I got this and opened it and started charging the battery. I almost couldn't wait until that was done to start using it, but when I shot the first few seconds of 1080p video and played it on my PC, it was like someone deflated me. I was so let down by the quality. Not only was the 1080p video grainy, but even slow movements with the camera caused choppy video and the colors were over saturated. I'm by no means a camera expert or a quality snob, but this was just not what I was expecting. I then spent the rest of the afternoon playing with settings, shooting in low light, outside in daylight, shooting at 720p and 720p 60fps and everything was disappointing. Maybe I was expecting too much from a $150 camera, but when I read something that says 1080p, I expect to see video in 1080p like I'm used to watching. Honestly, I couldn't even tell that much of a difference between the 1080p and the wvga videos. I'll be sending this camera back and just investing in a full blown video camera that does 1080p.Bottom line, if you're looking for a camera that shoots decent 1080p or even 720p video, don't get this one. If you're looking for a compact video camera that is easy to use, quick, and shoots mediocre video, then this might work for you.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this!!!", "Author": "CheerCoach", "ReviewID": "R2CCERLSZILJP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I am a coach and wanted to be able to film my team performing and easily share the video.

I have used it to film many things like a play,home movies,things for fun, and much more. The internal mic is decent. I would recommend buying an external mic(you can find one for about $40 on amazon). the video quality is great. It shoots in 16:9 aspic ration(wide screen). It has the options of 1080p, 720p, WVGA, and Picture modes. There is no auto focus,but it has a macro mode. I think they all do a great job. The pictures come out a little blurry but they look alright. The camera feels like a phone in your hand. I would recommend buying a case for it(about $10)on amazon. It can get scratched easily. Also buy a screen protector(comes with some cases). Also you should buy a Class  6 SD card for fast transfer to your computer. The flip out are s great. It is flexible so there is no strain on the arm when hooking up to a desktop computer. One thing I do not like about this camera is that you cannot zoom while in Macro mode, you must switch to normal and zoom then switch back. I love that you can hook it to your HDTV. The picture quality is amazing. I would recommend this camera to anyone. the video is filmed in WVGA, using macro and normal modes.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, poor construction quality", "Author": "R. V.

The Zi8 couldn't feel flimsier.  It seems to be made of cheap plastic and every corner has been cut.  Because the cover is a very slick plastic it gets dirty quickly from fingerprints.  Also, the cover is really hard to get off to get to the battery compartment.  Why they didn't put some ribs on there I don't know.  I had to put on a rubber dishwashing glove to get some friction.  Then, the cover for the SD card is so flimsy I am glad it doesn't have to come off regularly or it would surely get torn off.  The buttons for Delete, Play, etc, are very, very small so they are hard to press.  Oh, and they don't tell you in the instructions that you have to press and hold the off/on switch for a few seconds to get it to turn on.I had bought the Flip Mino HD and returned it because it didn't have an external mic connection and I am glad the Zi8 has one. But, the construction on the Mino was much sturdier.  I would be worried about this thing breaking in a backpack, or on a bike ride, and it would certainly not survive a drop onto a tile floor.Bob", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Review from a mac user", "Author": "Mollie D.

When the lighting is low are pretty much anything inside the video starts to get a little bit blocky.  For what it is it is fantastic, this is not for video production, however it is great for capturing vacations and family gatherings without having to haul around a larger much more expensive camera.  Got a 8gb flash card on ebay for $20 and that's good for a few hours of recording.  The editing software it comes with is very limited and that is the only area this comes up short.  Long story short she LOVES the camera, I think it's pretty cool if you're looking for a video camera you can't go wrong with this one as long as you don't expect make movies that are blu-ray quality.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8 Camcorder", "Author": "B.

When she told me the things she didn't need for gifts this year, a camcorder was one of them.  I wanted her to be surprised.  All I can say, is WOW.  She was surprised.  She loves the portability and quality of the recordings.  She never had seen anything like this before.  She's still playing around with it, but so far is totally in love with it.  She has a grand kid that is graduating from high school this spring, and I wanted her to have some modern and easy to carry around.  She still has an old VHSC camcorder from the early 1990's that is not the best at taking movies.  This way she can just hook it up to her computer and use the software that is installed on the camcorder and burn movies to CD or send them to people via e-mail.  The only 2 unfortunate things that I didn't care for, is that it didn't come with any memory.  Had to buy her an 8GB HDSC memory card.  The microphone isn't the best.  May have to get her an external microphone to hook up to it.  I also purchased an extra battery when I ordered this.

I also don't like the \"auto-USB\" connection. I'd much rather have a usb input on the unit than the male connector that pops out.But it is extremely handy. Turn on in 2 seconds, press button and you're shooting. Plug it into your computer, copy the files and you're done. I'd prefer it record in mp4, but converting from .mov is quite easy.So if you're looking for good video quality (even in good lighting): pay more money.

The new firmware 1.06 fixes some of the reported issues with the Zi8, but there is something left: when you zoom in, there is a moment where you can clearly see a brightness change and an annoying jump on the image.

Just shot for two hours (at 720p/60fps that is how much a 16gb sdhc card will hold) and still have more to go? just slide in a new sdhc card and keep shooting!- Swappable battery.

It is a drawback to people wanting wide 1080p HD, but it can also be used as sort of a fake optical zoom. When you go to import it into editing software you can make it all 720p if you want.Unfortunately my Zi8 had a \"dead\" gray pixel on it.

After trying out the Flip, a friend's Creative, and the checking a bunch of Zi8 video reviews, I decided to buy it.It is outstanding. The video quality is absolutely superb. There are a few issues with 1080p if you are moving the camera around a lot (blur effect), but for the most part, it produces a downright gorgeous picture compared to (at least what I've seen) every other competing product out there at the moment. The Zi8 has some image stabilization with taking videos, which definitely makes it better than Kodak's zi6.Its incredibly easy to use. While this is in no way near a professional camera, I find it very useful and easy to make videos with. Its simple, point, click, record, click, and you're done. Viewing and deleting videos on this is a snap too. A lot of complaints I hear about other products is that viewing and deleting files from your device is a pain, but with this, its easy.The biggest selling point for me on this product is its expandable memory. The Flip only offers built in memory (either 4gigs or 8gigs), and frankly, that could fill up quickly if you aren't careful. I did some black friday shopping and bought a 16 gig sdhc card for 20 bucks, and thats plenty of starting space. Since it takes SD cards, it'll be really easy in the future to buy more memory.The only major complaint i have is audio. Its not *bad*, but its not great either. The device does offer that mic jack, but i have yet to have a reason to try it. It also has a place for a tripod mount on the bottom for those interested.All in all, I love it, and am incredibly happy that I bought it.

The batteries arrived first so I had fully charged batteries ready to go when the Zi8 arrived.  Immediately after unpackaging the Zi8 I upgraded the firmware to 1.06.  This took all of 5 minutes to do.Almost all of the test video I have taken has been at night or in low light.  I have been using the 720p/60fps setting.  My first videos were taken while I was driving at night holding the camera in my hand above the dashboard and only the headlights and street lights and signs for illumination. Video looks great and smooth.  No problems with color or brightness.Macro mode works great also.  Took a few test close-up videos and the color and details were perfect.The internal mic works well but I have an external on order.Turn it on and it is ready for instant action.  The controls are simple to use; HDMI works great with my 40\" LCD TV, the USB, SDHC slot and charging options are all good and so is the tripod mount.  The camera build does not seem flimsy, quite tough actually.  I carry it around in my back pants pocket all day without worry.  It does not pick up lint like I read in another review and the actual lens is recessed so it does not get scratched or dirty.Transferring vidoe to the pc is easy but I haven't played with all of the software features yet but I did transfer video from the Zi8 that I converted to play on my Sansa Fuze and it looks great.Overall I am quite pleased with the Zi8.

The other units are the Kodak zx1.  RCA 300ezHD and the Flip Ultra 120 min 2GB(not mino or HD.Before I begin let me explain what I use the cameras for.  I am not a professional by any means.  I use the cameras for use only on occasion, the same as probably most of you reading this.  I might use it a lot for a 2 week period but then I'll go weeks or months with very minimal use.  I'm just your average person looking for a small camcorder to fit in my pocket, take pics/vids on demand, and all of this at a decent price.To start off, let me say that all of these camcorders are pretty similar to one another.  Each unit has a feature or two that the others do not have.  For example, the Flip has the ability to turn off the red recording light when you are recording.  A nice feature if you are \"spying\" on someone.  The RCA has a flip out lens that allows you to record yourself and see yourself in the LCD screen.  A nice feature.  The kodak zx1 has a weatherproof shell, making it ideal for some extreme sports fanatics.  And the zi8 has the external mic jack, unique only to this camcorder right now.One huge negative about the Flip is it's limited storage.  Depending on the model (I had the 120 min model) you are limited to the amount of video you can store.  Once the unit is full, you must transfer the videos to a computer before you can record.  There is no expansion slot - so no SD cards.  This is no big deal if you KNOW you are not going to go beyond 2 hrs, but in my case it was a deal breaker and was sent back.  The video on the Flip was good, no complaints.  I would say it was near the top, if not the top, in terms of audio/video quality at the comparable settings.  The audio was very good.  I like the fact that the unit runs on 2AA batteries or a flip battery pack.  A nice feature.  I don't know much about video size but I do know all the other units, except the RCA, stores the moves in .mov or mpeg4 which for some reason are LARGE files.  The RCA is in .avi and the files are pretty small. I don't really like the large files but it's workable.  I would recommend this product to someone if, again, they KNEW they were not going to need more than 2 hrs. of video before being able to transfer.The RCA 300ezHD was the first camera I got.  It is a nice little camera and retails now for less than $100.  As stated before, one nice thing about the RCA is the flip around camera lens.  It also has an expansion slot.  You can get A LOT of hours of video on even a small SD card.  For some reason the videos on the RCA are \"smaller\" in total size than all the other models.  It must be a quality thing.  Although the quality of the RCA does not match the other units, it is definitely decent quality.  The biggest problem with this unit is it's audio.  The audio on this unit is HORRIBLE.  Very, very bad.  I did keep this unit because of the expandable memory but the audio is really bad.  It is by far teh worst audio of all the units.  Where the other units are still easily heard, this unit is non-existent.  You just can't hear it unless the volume is high or the speaker is close up.  It does not run on 2AA but you can buy a few cheap rechargeable batteries which are nice.The Kodak zi1 is a nice camera.  The video quality is comparable to the Flip and zi8, though the zi8 is better than both.  The audio on the zx1 is not as good as the flip but not as bad as RCA.  It's acceptable though for most any type of regular video shooting.  The zi1 runs off of 2AA batteries, just like the flip.  I like that feature.  Plus you can buy a few rechargeable batteries to make sure you have enough juice.  This unit does not have a flip out usb like all the other units, but that wasn't a big deal to me.  Just like the flip and zi1, the video files are large.  I don't know why.  A minute can give you a 300mb file on the low setting.  Again, not a big deal.I purchased the zi8 after owning all the other cameras.  I would not say the zi8 is really better than the other cameras, except the RCA.  The video and audio quality is comparable to the Flip and Zi1.  It does have the ability to do true HD but that feature doesn't matter to me.  I like the external mic option, which is why I bought it, but after taking some video with it, I don't know if it is really necessary for what I plan do use the camera for.  The internal audio works very well.  It does not run on AA's but runs on batteries similar to the RCA.  A few extra batteries will ensure enough juice.  I do not like the usb flip out on this camera.  It is not rigid like the RCA and Flip.  It is flimsy and seems like over time it might break.  Time will tell.  The video files are similar to the flip and kodak zx1, they are very large.  The one big negative about this unit is that you have to buy an SD card for it and because the files are so large a 2GB SDHC card only gives you about an hour of video (on the lowest setting).  So be prepared to spend a decent amount of money on the SDHC card.  Although this is a good camera, depending on your needs, this camera doesn't seem to be much better than the zi1 or the flip, of course it does offer a few more features.All in all, I like the zi8 but again, it's not tremendously better than the flip or zi1.  I'll be keeping the zi8 but for the money I don't necessarily think it is worth it, but again, depends on your needs.If you have any questions, feel free to email me at steveessie123 at yahoo.UPDATE:I have owned the zi8 for several months now and have been very happy with it.  Although I still agree with my original post, I would probably give it 4 stars now.  The clarity of this thing is great, even in the lowest mode (which is all I ever use it for).  Also, when combined with a wireless mic system (kodak customer support says a wireless mic won't work...it will) this system is awesome.  I would definitely recommend this unit.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "An okay camera for beginners", "Author": "Kenneth Michael Mcneil", "ReviewID": "RAYJPGL378R0K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Kodak zi8 is part of a new popular type of camcorders. The \"pocket\" camcorder caught on with the flip video series. Their cameras are practically the apple ipods of the camcorder world. These are designed for taking video whenever you need to. The Kodak is here to compete with this. The Kodak zi8 has many, many more features than its rival, the Flip MinoHD Camcorder  2nd Generation, 120 Minutes (Brushed Metal) NEWEST MODEL or Flip UltraHD Camcorder, 120 Minutes (Black). This camera has a lot of advantages over these. If you are NOT looking for an easy camera, and want a more professional video, then don't buy this or any pocket camcorder. Here are some pros and cons.PROsVery Good quality (1080p FULL HD!)Very portableDifferent shooting modes including 60FPS 720p videoAbility to also take picturesSomewhat stylishMicrophone JackCONsHORRIBLE CAMERA SHAKE4x Digital (aka unusable) ZoomPlastic body (not good build quality)Can't do anything until a few seconds after startNot very responsiveThe quality is positively amazing for its size, so that is probably the foremost feature of the camera. The other shooting modes and picture options are also great. The reason I took away 2 stars is the camera shake. It has electronic stabilization but there is hardly a difference while using it. You may not see any problems while previewing it, but on a large screen it makes the video hard to watch. For some people it can make you dizzy.The zoom is also awful, It would have been easier to not put in any at all. Digital zoom does not adjust the optics at all. Optical is actually like looking through binoculars on the camera. Digital is basically just taking the picture and enlarging it. They have made it so you can zoom while filming but at 4x the video gets really blurry.As mentioned in the first paragraph, this camera is for beginners. You will not get anything professional out of this becausea) it looks like an iPodb) There are no options in the menu for manual things.c) EVERYTHING is automatic.The reason it is for beginners is because of C. As soon as you record the camera auto adjusts. If you would like a little control of your camera, don't buy this.Over all, the camera's HD quality is impressive for size and price, but it lacks any tools of a professional, or even amateur video maker's camera.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent video quality for money", "Author": "Kumar Veetrag \"Veetrag\"", "ReviewID": "R30BJY5OV63EA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "had a long debate on which camera to buy Flip Ultra HD or Zi8 and finally I decided on Zi8 and I am happy with my decision for following reasons -1.

The digital zoom is usually worthless, unless you have plenty of light.  Zooming in indoors is terrible!!!  The still pictures are terrible, don't bother.The image stabilization is also digital, as opposed to optical, so don't expect much there either.  So the movies are shaky, and zooming in means losing quality, so zoom out and walk closer to the subject.  It's the size of a cell phone, which is why I got it.  White Balance can be weird at times.  I got a short clip inside our bathroom to see what it would look like, and the color was horrible in the movie.  Ours walls looked like they were bright yellow, which they aren't.  So I ended up using a movie editor to correct the white balance.  I'll keep it for a a while.  But I like the idea of a compact camera, and the fact that it is the size of a cell phone is very appealing to me because I actually take it in my pocket.  Sometimes, it's too intimidating to take a normal-size camcorder with you, so the Zi8 can be very helpful.  You walk into an arts store with a normal camcorder and someone might approach you quickly with a \"sorry, sir, no camcorders allowed.\"  But you can walk right in with your Zi8 in your pocket, quickly turn it on, capture a quick clip and nobody will even notice. :)  (I don't care for taking camcorders in those places, it's just an example.)

I ended up with Kodak because my colleagues use it and have been consistently satisfied with the quality.  The camera does not disappoint.  It is superior to the Flip in that it has a memory card reader; this makes it infinitely easier to share the camera and the files.

It wasn't. I went through their online protocol for testing the product. No joy.I got online and engaged in a chat session with Kodak support. They walked me through the exact same protocol, even though I mentioned I had tested everything.I should note, some of their test steps are quite generic, for example, their battery has a notch in it so there is only one sure way to insert the unit. Still, you're asked to make sure you insert the battery the right way. But I digress ....After a 20 minute online session, they instructed me to return the unit, they emailed me a code. They also informed me --- rather sternly --- that though the unit was under warranty, that if in any way they felt I was at fault, I'd be charged.Adding insult to injury, the cost of shipping was on me.Two weeks later, in the mail, we received a 'refurbished unit', meaning it was a repair of someone else's return.What did I learn from this experience? The following:1. wait 2 months to buy a refurb at 1/2 the price - and is also under warranty.2. figure in $15 to the price of the unit for repairs/returns3. figure in an additional $10 for the cost of accessories such as batteries as they are proprietary4. not to buy a Kodak product for at least the next several years until their product management and/or client support modifies their approach5. when I see a product has 4 star reviews out of 440 reviews - carefully read the 40 negative reviews to see if there are repeating patterns of problems ... such as units not powering up after mild usage.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible...but why bother...", "Author": "Danny Mack", "ReviewID": "R2IGSGJKF12HPT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own it, use it, love it.

The lightweight actually works well if you have to hold it to film something.  Quality is awesome if you have a tripod and sufficient lighting.  The EIS improves image stabilization marginally but what can you really expect from a sub-$180 pocket camcorder.

There's option to save the edited video on your computer, upload to youtube or facebook and other options.  The battery doesn't last very long but eventually, I'll buy replacement batteries.

Maybe a bad batch. If I did, I'd be exchanging mine immediately.  What I DID notice is a hot pixel on the screen but not in the videos.  Annoying but not a deal breaker. I tried the 1080p and 720/60fps modes. The 60fps requires a bit more workflow to upload it and have it play smoothly.  I would not upload it AS 60fps and rely on youtube or whomever to convert it to 30.  I'd convert myself, then share the file.For having it around and being able to quickly record what my kids are doing it's great.  Use the foot zoom.  The IS (image stabilization) I kind of ignore.  I hear it doesn't work too well and it likely eats up batteries and makes the unit hot.  It's so small I don't imagine IS helps with the shaking. Use a mini tripod or some temporary support.If this is your only method of recording video for your important memories, I suggest purchasing a separate HD camcorder.

The serial number is located at the bottom and starts with a letter \"K\".Me:  Serial Number is xxx...Kodak:  Let's try to charge the battery. Please tell me if you see a light indicator.Me:  While it is plugged in the screen says it is fully charged. Where would this indicator light be?Kodak:  Please disconnect it from the wall outlet and the charger, turn on the camera and tell me exactly what will happen.Me:  Nothing happens.Kodak:  Please remove the battery and wipe the contacts with a clean dry cloth then, re-insert it and turn it on again.Me:  I've done that already, but will do again.  Done. Nothing happens.Kodak:  I see.  The problem with your product appears to be something you cannot fix yourself. We recommend that you send your product to an authorized Kodak repair center for evaluation. What battery are you using?Me:  The Kodak klic-7004 that came with the camera.Kodak:  That is the correct battery.Me:  Yes.Kodak:  When did you purchase the camera?Me:  3 days ago. Arrived yesterday. It has never worked.Kodak:  It is your option to turn back the camera to the store and have it replaced, or we can set up a repair for this camera and have it fixed.Me: I will return to Amazon for a refund.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only good for very few situations", "Author": "Mr. Chris", "ReviewID": "R1X4QJ3IXWO8OD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The only use for camera is a portable means to film interviews with people in well lighted areas.

I'm using these cameras in research, which requires a few key features:+External mic input - essential for getting understandable voices in many environments.  I use the Olympus ME52 voice mic and a mono-stereo adapter and it works very well, slighly emphasizing the spoken word and de-emphasizing background noise.  A good cheap mic that also works well is the jWIN stereo computer mic.+Range of video resolutions including 1080p, 720p, and, importantly, a wide SD mode (WVGA).  I shoot mostly WVGA as this balances quality of the video with manageable file sizes.  Much of our research and video work is fast cycle, so the speed and ease with which we can manipulate and edit the long WVGA video files is a big plus.  Editing MOV files is also easier than some of the other encoding alternatives chosen by other camera manufacturers, for example, AVCHD with high bit rates.+Wide angle lens option - essential for many indoor shots.  Using the Kodak Zi8 0.45x Wide Angle With Macro (Modification Style) Magnetic Lens + Cronies Micro-Fiber Cleaning Cloth which fits perfectly and does the job at .45x magnification.+Records to SD cards vs. internal memory - essential for managing multiple days of research back to back.  To enhance speed of download and just to ensure smoothest possible recording, I'm using the SanDisk 16gb Extreme 30MB/s Edition SDHC High Performance Card.+Removable battery - again, needed for shooting long research hours over multiple days.  Nice that this battery is also the Fuji NP50, making for broader availability and more charger options.  I'm getting 100+ minutes of recording on a full charge and fresh battery.+VERY easy to use!  Menus, controls, ports, all easy to find, intuitive to figure out and use.  Essential when introducing new folks to the camera under the pressure of field research.What I wish for in the next version:-USB/webcam live video out - would make capturing live video directly to computer much easier.-Model with Optical image stabilization - Electronic helps, but there is really no comparison to OIS.-Model with Optical zoom, say 27 (wide) to 100 mm (35 mm equivalent).-Separate start/stop button from the zoom controller/joystick.  Too easy to accidentally start or stop a recording when you don't mean to.-Option to disable the red tally light - distracting-Model with Bluetooth audio in/AV out - take in a BlueTooth mic like the Sony ECM-AW3 for even better audio, monitor live audio via bluetooth headphones or headsets, and stream AV to a computer.-Small clip on external battery to extend run time (without making any ports or the tripod connector unusable).-Less finicky about which SD cards work for extended recording.-Headphone jack to monitor audio if the BT bandwidth is taken up with input.I'd pony up another 50% increase in the price for these improvements!Additional key accessories besides those above:+Kodak 1047398 Pocket Video Case - very compact, but fits camera, extra batteries, the external mic and the wide angle lens.+Kodak Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery/KLIC 7004  10x Kodak Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery/KLIC 7004 or Fuji NP50 and a good, compact travel charger.+TrekTech TrekPod mono/tri pod - most versatile pod there is, and carrying it with your camera mounted stabilizes shots to a remarkable degree, sort of like a poor person's steadycamBut all in all, a great product for the price, with critically important (to me) features that set it apart.

First, the files this thing produces are huge and difficult to manipulate, even with well established video editors like Sony Vegas. The file format is MOV and is a high end H.263 format. After a lot of experimenting, I found out that I could rename the file extension to MKV, and then VideoLan (VLC) would play the files perfectly. But to edit them, I had to convert to a different format. I have been using a program called SUPER which does a nice job, BUT, I'm unhappy with the 720p 60fps mode. This is supposed to be for sporting events, where the high frame rate helps to reduce motion blur. But no player or converter I have found yet can handle this frame rate. I have two young boys in a wrestling club, and the Zi8 is perfect to take matside to record the events, and freeze motion, but I have not been able to take advantage of this. Also, the unit claims to be a 5.1 Mpixel digital camera. It is marginal in outdoor lighting and terrible indoors, especially in fluorescent light. It does record 1080p, but you need a high speed SDHC card, and frankly, unless you can hold your little Zi8 perfectly still, nothing looks worse jiggly video shot at 1080p! This is a tripod only mode! I'm still deciding weather to keep this guy. I must admit the video shot at 720p 30fps is amazingly good, and holds up well even in low, fluorescent light.

The camcorder was on back order, but has proven to be worth the wait.The Zi8 is extremely easy to use, if you bother to do a quick once over on the included pocket guide (and it's a brief guide, so there's no excuse if you don't look through it). There were a couple of icons I wasn't readily sure of, and it answered those questions easily. Operation is simple, the microphone is placed out of the way of my fingers, and the screen is very sharp.The battery life is pretty short, much less than the amount of footage the 8 GB card I put in can record. I would recommend a second battery pack. Outdoors, it can be pretty hard to see the screen. My test run was at an air show in San Diego, so it was phenomenally bright out, but I still didn't have that hard of a time tracking speeding planes, and the menu options were still easy to read.When I did some test recordings, there was a high pitched whine on playback. However, once I hooked the camcorder up to the TV, or loaded the videos to my computer, that disappeared. The internal mic actually did a very good job of recording sound, without blowing out on loud sounds or losing very soft or distant ones.Still photos are only okay. Better than on my smartphone, way weaker than on my regular digital cameras. And there's no flash. This is really just a bonus feature, as it won't replace a \"real\" digital camera.Transfer to my Mac was simple.

I bought this camera specifically with the intent of having something that I could fit in my pocket that would give much better results compared to a phone. Yes the video can be shaky at times, but train yourself to shoot steady and you'll be rewarded for it.The low light is quite decent considering how tiny of a sensor this camera has, yes you get blocky artifacts when it gets too dark, but this cam was made for youtube and youtube compression makes everything blocky regardless. The internal mic is amazingly good for being mono, all my videos are of very loud metal concerts, and theres very little clipping in any of my footage, hardly noticeable to the average viewer. With a little audio knowledge (stereo imaging, compression, and reverb) you can actually get very useable audio from the internal mic, not to mention the ability to use an external. When shooting a concert environment, I have to use the 720p/60i setting because when you use the 30p settings strobe lights cause tearing between frames, the 60i frame rate avoids this (that is an issue with any cmos based camera really). Lens flare is very prominent, so pre-composing shots is recommended.The feature set of this camera far outdoes anything in its category. a high SPL microphone, an external microphone input, HDMI output, replaceable batteries, macro mode, and SD cards (that is a HUGE plus) so running out of memory is a non-issue.There are definitely downfalls of this camera, but bear in mind the features and functionality of this camera (not to mention fitting in your pocket) are miles ahead of any competitor. it won't have the dynamic range, low light capability, resolution, 4:4:4 chroma space of a RED camera (obviously) but it beats the rusty circuits out of your phone for just a little over $100.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Nittany", "ReviewID": "RDUR719CGKHYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Camera.

I was very nervous it wasnt going to perform well but it has surprised me quite a bit. I have had it now for over 3 years and its still works fantastically. I will admit the sound quality isnt top notch but for such an inexpensive and small camera it is pretty good and I am very picky about audio quality let me tell you. The on/off button is a bit odd to me simply because it is rubbery and slightly difficult to press down but it isnt enough of an issue for me to dislike the camera at all. The WOW FACTOR is the storage which is awesome since you put in the card you want. I have over 2 hours worth of video saved on the camera right now and it still has room. Another WOW FACTOR is the battery life to me which when I first got the camera worried me because it was so inexpensive but I havent been disappointed. My mom was able to film my entire graduation ceremony without stopping which came to over an hour of filming without the battery giving out or the camera getting hot. Its also got a pretty stable lense- I went horseback riding and filmed a little while doing so and the video came out steady. Over all a great camera if you are looking for something inexpensive and for fun. :)Edit January 2014: Still loving this camera. Just wanted to say that when I bought it the cost was only around $60. The current price listed is almost $500. That seems like a giant mistake to me. This is a great camera- yes- but it isn't a $500 camera. Maybe $150 is the max I would spent on it. The one thing I would add is that I can't seem to find a tripod or stand for this camera. I realize its handheld but even most handhelds have a stand option or ability. This camera even has a notch at the base that seems like it would be the place for a tripod.

I don't think it's TRUE HD.The sound from the on-board mic isn't that great, I bought a $20 lapel mic by Audio Technica to get better, less hollow sound--that is one bonus to this mic, it has a mic input!There are a few separate add-ons to buy to really use this thing to it's full potential. If you can afford a professional quality microphone with a stereo input, than you are in business!The fact that there are so many extras to buy to really make this thing beneficial, I think makes it not worth $450 (that is crazy!). It is a good little camera, and it does what it's supposed to very well, plus the 720p @ 60fps looks REALLY good. But again, $450, plus however much for a memory card, and you will most likely want a microphone which means more money, I don't think it's worth all of that.

It has been coast to coast about four times, taken videos in clubs, at outdoor music festivals, through the windows of the California Zephyr, out airplanes, while attached to the tripod in my car and even on boats. I have used it to shot videos for clients, sporting events and darn near everything. I love it, but I will be putting it away until I can get another due to the 300% price increase now that it is discontinued. Just say no!This devices SHINES at 720/60FPS. That is where I shoot most videos because of the smoothness that 60FPS gives when panning or shooting action. 1080 30FPS and 720FPS is just not smooth on any HD device if you do not pan or follow action smoothly. If the action is fast, forget the smooth anyway. At 720/60FPS, it takes a bit more of your card than 1080/30FPS. No big deal since battery life tends to mirror what an 8GB SDHC card can record. There is still \"judder\" which is probably more a technology issue than a Zi8 issue, but not as much.Speaking of SDHC cards, I use the Class 10 Transcends with exceptional results. I also have a Kodak ZXD as my \"glove box\" HD and although it does well, I just like the feel of the Zi8 better. The little control knob is easier to manage as are the men functions.One note, if I was to be picky, manually operating the zoom can create two issues.1. The zoom is very hard to operate in a linear, or smooth fashion on the device. I just resist zooming while recording.- The cure is the cheap little remote. The remote zooms much smoother. If I have both hands free, I will control it with the Kodak zoom.2. In marginal lighting situations, if you zoom, you will cause the camera to shift it's response to light conditions. That almost never changes for the good. In low-light conditions, I do not zoom unless it is absolutely necessary.Also, I have used it as a camera, but if it is weak across the board, it is as a camera. No settings to help you there. I didn't buy it as a still camera so no big deal. Main issue with the camera is sharpness.This is still a 5 Star device and that is after one year and literally hundreds of hours of video in all conditions all over the USA. I have a \"real\" HD camcorder coming, the Panasonic HDC-TMC900 and will do a comparison.

But remember that it is a pocket video camera, not a professional video camera.  That being said, the camera is well made, very simple to operate, and slides neatly into your shirt or pants pocket.First of all, I haven't experienced any problems with the built-in microphone, no noises, hiss or anything else. A unique feature of this camera that you can't find in almost any other camera of this type is the external microphone jack.  This is the reason I purchased this camera.  I use it to film flights in light aircraft, and the external mic jack allows me to connect a cable to the intercom/radio system, so you can hear the pilot and passengers as well as air traffic on the radio (and eliminate the noise of the engine and wind blast). It works wonderfully for this purpose although you have to be careful to set the gain properly on the source end of your signal.The camera starts up and shuts down quickly.  The simple menus are icon driven and very easy to operate.  Buttons could have been a little larger instead of the thin, silver ones on this camera.The picture quality is stunning at 1080p, although as mentioned in other reviews you must take care to use high-speed, high capacity SDHC cards, not only for the speed but 1080p will devour card memory like nobody's business.  I set the camera on 720p to conserve card capacity, and the video results are still breathtaking. I started out years ago with an 8mm video camcorder and the difference in the quality between that and HD is incredible.  Low light obviously will increase grain considerably, given the tiny lens of the camera, but video taken at night with this camera is still much better than the old camcorders I used to use.  Of course in very dark situations you won't see anything on the recording but black (where is Sony Night Shot when you need it).Battery life was acceptable for most purposes. I found that turning off the camera between uses, and not taking super long video shots makes a big difference in battery life.The camera also takes still images, and like the video, even at 720p the photos were fantastically detailed and sharp, with super realistic color and contrast.A few cons:  Of course, as a pocket camera, the zoom capability is extremely limited.I would prefer that the camera not have an internal/proprietary battery. I realize that is done to make the camera smaller, but it would be nice if it just ran on AA's.One other annoying trait (although this won't bother 99% of the users out there), when filming through the windscreen of a light aircraft, the camera blurs the propeller into an odd, stacked-sickle shape. My old Mini-DV Samsung camcorder would record a very normal looking propeller blur, by comparison.  One other thing, when the camera was mounted in the airplane and the IS (image stabilization) was turned on, the image would do this swimming kind of distortion all through the frame. The vibration of the airplane didn't mesh well with the IS in the camera. Switched the IS off and the image returned to normal.Overall I appreciate the very high quality of the video and photos this camera can produce, its light weight and pocket size, and I find the auxiliary microphone jack to be indispensable.  I would buy another Kodak Zi8 immediately if this one were lost or stolen.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cutt off when youre running low on battery!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2CCZ6V5SOZ6NM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would give it five stars but the battery light was flashing on and i was trying to record what i could till it ended, then the battery went out. and it WOULDNT COME BACK ON.

I really wasn't expecting a $3,000 camcorder but after looking at the stats and the price, it would be hard to fall short. The only thing I have to compare it to is two cameras that I own (Fujifilm FinePix S9100 and Canon Powershot SD940 IS) which neither are designed for video. However, they both at least shoot a solid video without interruption and don't yield bad results. The Kodak Zi8 is a fairly small design which is nice and fits easily in my pocket (roughly the size of my iphone) which I did like. The problems I ran into were in the recording firmware. I purchased a 16GB Class 10 SDHC Memory Card which I assumed would work great for a camera of this caliber but I was wrong. The Kodak Zi8 has issues with most lighting settings I've encountered so far while shooting. Unless I am in the sun and shooting in the sun, it doesn't even take 720p/60fps. It usually cuts off after :02 seconds of recording. I've noticed that in 1080p/30fps and 720p/30fps it does the same thing but can last a little bit longer before shutting off. The only format that doesn't have issues is WVGA which is not what I purchased the camcorder to shoot in. After looking online through some forums this is a known issue from other users and Kodak says it has a build in shut off when the sensor doesn't pick up enough light because it gets grainy with low light settings (which is understandable), however, their should be an option so that your videos don't get cut off in the middle of shooting. It's very frustrating because there were numerous times I was recording my daughter dancing around being goofy (moments that I want to remember) and instead of getting one full shot, it took three shots for one single song (so sad). I've done everything from formatting the card in the Kodak Zi8, on a computer, and updating the firmware on the Kodak Zi8 and nothing has worked so far. Another major downfall in my opinion is the very narrow lens which requires you to stand pretty far back to get a decent shot of anything. Ultimately, I am going to try to sell it or return it as I'd rather save up an extra $100 and get a real camcorder that allows you to control the settings and won't cut out in the middle of recording.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video", "Author": "ERose", "ReviewID": "R2BBFINB96BB3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really enjoy it.

But in 1080p mode, there is some lag when you pan around the camcorder too fast. But there is the 720p 60fps mode to compensate for this and very much sufficient for general home use. The construct is pretty good and its easy to learn and operate. Video quality is very good. Specially in general home lighting conditions and at night with yellow light, the video comes out fairly good. I was happy with it. Much better than the cell phones or some of the point and shoot cameras. Battery longevity is not great. But should be sufficient for a couple of hours of off and on recording. The power switch is a little bit difficult to operate. You surely would need a good size card for long recordings. Depending on use, I would suggest a 16 GB or may be even a 32GB to do both videos and photos. I have not taken too many photos, but the few I did came out quite good. You surely need good lighting conditions for good quality photos. The image stabilization seems to work fairly well.The transition between different video modes / photo mode is little slow. So it will not work if you are in hurry to switch modes.Only major drawback that I see is that zoom is completely useless.

It has some good points and bad points.  I liked the compact size and the fact that I could use flash cards instead of buying tapes or disks.  It has OK or fair battery life.  Some of the problems, however, are that for one, the audio circuitry becomes very noisy after it has been recording for about 3 minutes, and is so bad that it almost drowns out the sound you are trying to record.  The microphone is not very sensitive, either.  Another problem area is the picture quality.  If used with ambient lighting indoors, the picture fidelity is a lot worse than that of a standard-definition camcorder.  With any of the recording modes while using indoor lighting, you get video quality that resembles a runny water-color painting.  If you are shooting outdoors, however, it will give you great, true HD quality.  Another thing; the fixed-focus lens was not very sharply focused.  I guess it was not bad for the price, but not the quality performer I have come to expect from Kodak.  Please note that I am speaking for a Zi8 model purchased in 2009 when the Zi8 first came out.  If the models made since 2009 have been improved and updated, hopefully these Zi8's will be better.  Kodak makes excellent digital still cameras that also shoot very nice video, although not in HD.  Personally, I would have been better off getting one of Kodak's newer digital still cameras to replace my old 3.1 mega-pixel EasyShare (which shot way better videos than the Zi8).", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!", "Author": "Casey's Mom", "ReviewID": "R3UBRZBCBU6FDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went to Arizona for a week and used this every day, taking about 272 videos and photos. This was the first time I'd ever taken any videos.  When I got home, I made a 45 minute movie DVD using the Kodak Media Impression software. I used photos, videos, and incorporated bunches of music in my video and it came out awesome.  I'm definitely no computer whiz kid, but I had a blast editing my photos and videos.  I had planned to purchase a separate photo and video editing software, but this free software did everything I needed it to.  (There's also an awesome woman on YouTube who gives step by step instructions on all aspects of this camera if you have any problems that the instruction manuals don't address.)Regarding the camera, it's very easy to use.  At first I didn't like the little red \"roller ball\", but got the hang of it eventually.  I went back and forth from photos to videos constantly, and I sometimes chose the incorrect format accidentally, but overall it was simple to change formats.  All of my photos and videos were very good quality.  The only problem with the videos was there was horrible shaking when trying to record a video while walking.  I'd never done videos before, so live and learn...The last night of vacation, I did a lot of recording and the camera did freeze up after continuous recording of about 10 or more minutes.  It wouldn't shut off, no buttons would work, etc. and it felt really hot.  I just let it sit and it ended up shutting itself off.  I was worried that I'd lost everything in it, but I charged it that night, and the next morning I turned it on and everything was there.  I haven't had a problem since.  I guessed that I'd over-worked it that night.  I'd have given this review 5 stars except for this snafu. It hasn't happened since, but I haven't tried to record anything over a few minutes at a time.Overall, I'm in love with this little camera and I take it everywhere with me.

Some of the things I loved about it:- 60 fps 720p video, great for fast moving sports/etc.- external mic input - good for blog interviews- great quality footage for such a cheap camera.- Expandability of SD cards.- Many accessories included in pack.- Remote not included, but very handy - suggest getting one at only $10 or so.  Kodak Remote Control for Zx1, Zi8 and PlaySport Pocket Video CamerasSome of the things I didn't like as much:- Poor image quality in lower light situations.- So-so implementation and quality of standard photos.All in all a great camera, and I'd highly recommend it, as long as you don't plan on using it a ton in low light situations, or as your main still image camera -as it doesn't perform that well in those situations.The video included has some footage I shot at the Mall of America's theme park. Lots of fast moving roller coasters and other rides.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Portable, easy to use", "Author": "Alfonso Priale", "ReviewID": "R2ZOV1G91XIFNF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I need a camera to record the growing of my little baby.

So far, it's worked wonderfully, when people where black gi's (or dark clothing) you have to make sure the light is bright enough so that they don't bleed into becoming a blob. I have mainly used this camera indoor's and have had no problems at all. Audio is good, video is great and it's easy to use. I imagine if someone were to film any sporting event, this camera would more than meet their expectations. UNLESS it were a night time football game. EVen then, the field is well lit enough for you to capture everything, I would suggest sitting as close to the field as possible.If aimed directly at light, is does blow the source out, meaning, if you take a video of someone standing next to a bright lamp, it might make part of them disappear, in that case, don't aim directly at the light, and the problem is solved. Just of center it a bit.I got this camera for $100 dollars, I have a Kingston 16 gig class 4 card that can capture 2 hours and 9 minutes. I also bought an extra battery for 15 bucks, and a remote for 10. All in all, it would have cost me 160 or so. Which is the same price for a Flip, which personally I don't like a much. I think their video quality is good, maybe even similar, but this shoots amazing video in both 1080p and 720/60 frames per second, (which is where I tend to keep it) that coupled with the fact that I could buy external mic's for this thing. Great stuff.Can I shoot a block buster film with it. No. Can I tape auditions, BJJ matches, and day to day life of watching my neice and nephew run around.

I was fortunate, and got it on sale and so it cost me the same as a Flip (if not cheaper) and (although I've used a Flip and it's good) this Kodak is totally superior in every way.However, the only slight problem I have with the package is that the editing software that comes with it was a bit cumbersome to use for me. Even after checking out YouTube tutorials and other things it was a bit awkward for me to get all of the use out of the software (of course the problem could just be me). I will be checking online for a version that will edit .MOV files or even see if Windows Movie Maker will do the trick. But even with that said, I still wouldn't trade my Kodak for any other video camera even if they gave it to me for free.

I mainly shoot using the camera's 720P 60fps setting. Even though this camera has image stabilization, it is not a fix all. Sure, this camera boasts a 1080P resolution at 30fps and it is quite crisp.......... IF you use a tripod or you plan on having the steadiest hands on the planet. The EIS doesn't do much justice for this camera when shooting at 1080P. Even with the steadiest hand, at 1080P - you get a crisp but very very shaky picture. For some reason, the 720P 60fps resolution is the best and the EIS seems to work a tad better at this setting.  The still pictures at 5mb a shot are pretty decent too.  The option to have up to 32gb of SD memory cards is a plus. Although, I never found myself filming more than an hour's worth of short videos. The macro feature is decent too. Not the best, but this is a pocket video camera and it's pretty decent overall.  I sold my Flip Ultra HD after getting this camera. Why? It just seemed to offer more in regards to features, picture quality and compact size (the Flip Ultra HD is a pretty thick pocket phone with only 8gb of space to show for it). This camera does shoot in an older video format of .mov, but it's not a big deal since ArcSoftware (the software that comes with the camera) gives you the ability to convert to .MP4 and other formats. You can also upload videos and pics from your Kodak Zi8 to YouTube and Facebook using the software.

In the advertisement on Amazon when I purchased one for myself and son, I read that the Flip by Cisco had the image stabilization and ability to record in 60 fps, and customer reviews said that the Kodak did not. When the Kodak arrived I read the instruction booklet and the online User Guide and found out it does indeed have the 760/fps plus image stabilization. It also comes with the HDMI and A/V cords to enable connecting to the TV and a battery charger with USB cord which plugs into the wall or computer to charge the included rechargeable batteries.It took experimenting until I figured out that the left/right, up/down arrows have to be \"rolled\" rather than pressed. It should say that in the User Guide. I spent a while pressing on the arrow keys, having them work sometimes and not others until I discovered it takes a rolling motion to make them work.Thus, the Kodak Zi8 has it all but somehow all this was omitted from the earlier reviews.

I've gotten clear video and pictures of pets that I've never been able to get a shot of before.  I also received a magnetic macro lens that is just awesome.  My husband was able to take clear pictures of his spiders, scorpions, and insects by using it with the camera.Other than being great with pets, It took me approximately 1 minute to figure out all of the controls and start using it.  I would consider it very user friendly.  I also found it to be better than the Flip, which another family member received.  The view screen is much larger, it is more user-friendly, the picture quality is better and it was a lot less expensive.  My only complaint is that the zoom when it is in picture mode is inadequate, but can be corrected if you are willing to buy additional lenses.

From its first use I was highly surprised in the superior quality the camera produced. In the daylight, the camera produces flawless video and audio when combined with an external compact microphone. Nighttime and dark setting videos are good but are fairly grainy. As other user reviews have stated, an external microphone is highly recommended as there is a whinny background noise without it. Having the removable SD card for storage allows for expandable storage and simple transfer of videos if you do not want to deal with the Kodak software. Just be aware that my camera only accepts 16GB cards but the camera freezes after 8GB are occupied by files/videos on the card. I have tried multiple 16GB cards and the camera will only record a max of 8GB to a single card. Due to the large bitrate and file type of the video, an above average computer is required for smooth playback. A laptop with a core2duo and 3GB of RAM can't even smoothly play the videos without problem. The compact size and lightweight of the camera allows you to carry the camera around with ease. Overall there are a few faults of the camera, but at a hundred dollars this easy to camera gives you high quality at a rock-bottom price.

Both my friend and I own one, and we are currently using two of these to film the movie, in addition to a higher-end $800 camera. The only difference between the two cameras is 3mp and a difference in lens size. The Kodak is obviously not quite as good, but it becomes extremely handy for filming footage on the go. For a student filmmaker, who wishes to create real quality footage, this should be your number one choice, unless you happen to have at least $500 on you.PROS:I couldn't ask for a better camera within this price range. It beats any model of the Flip any day, and for a significantly lower price, too (you will save aprox. $40). I did tons of research to try to find a cheap full HD camera with external mic input, and this was only one of two I could find with both of those features. The other option was the Kodak Playtouch. Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the Zi8 predecessor was the big awesome touchscreen, but other reviewers say that its glitches outweigh its pros. Many prefer the Zi8 over the Playtouch. I for one actually strongly prefer the physical buttons over a touch screen, because these make the more important features easier to access. Using the buttons, I can quickly switch between video capture and browsing photos and videos. The built in settings allow me to adjust all the bare necessities, including the amount of audio captured through the built in mic and external mic. This makes this camcorder much easier to use than most. The Zi8 can film in WVGA, 720p, 720p (60fps), 1080p, and take 5mp stills. I can transfer my footage into my computer using the built in USB plug. The computer only recognizes the SD card (which is totally fine with me. much faster too) and opens by default in iPhoto. I usually just open it up in Finder, where I open up a folder to reveal all the SD card's contents.Large Clear LCD, Quick Focus, 1080p Full HD, Lightweight, Tripod Mountable, External mic input, Easy to Use, Audio Output, HDMI Output, USB, SD Card Slot, Great Picture Quality, Strong BlacksCONS:The screen quality does not reflect the video quality, so I am not able to watch my movies in full HD after I have filmed them. When shooting in low light, the dimmer spots are almost black, and the video becomes very grainy. I wish it had flash, but if I really need that feature, I just pull out my iPhone 4. As a high-schooler, I cannot afford a lot of gear, but possibly in the future, I see lighting and bounce boards being very helpful. The Zi8 sports a 5x zoom: not quite ideal for filming objects from a distance. Instead, I have to move myself and the tripod up to the actual scene. When I take the camcorder off its tripod, I find it difficult to hold the device completely still, as opposed to a traditionally shaped camcorder. The fact that the Zi8 is thicker on top makes it slightly more so.Limited Zoom, Top Heavy, Poor In Low Light, Only 5mpAccessories I Recommend:Polaroid 72 inch TripodOpteka TH20 Ball Head with Quick Release Plate for TripodsAudio Technica ATR-55 Condenser Shotgun Microphone", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "PhotgraphicLee", "ReviewID": "R9F2KM95D81W5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a good product to have around like an additional cellphone.

I can take it home and view videos later while I'm grading presentations. Easy, easy, easy for me and my students to use! Now that I've found a solution to the quietness of the audio, I'm very happy with this purchase.Dislikes: Audio playback is pretty quiet. I finally found a way to fix this issue when I plugged the camera into my TV (needs to be one with audio and video plugs on the front) and turned the volume WAY up. This finally allowed my students to hear themselves on the video. Before, when I plugged it into my ancient computer and tried to play back the video, the computer bogged way down and wouldn't let me show the entire video.Teachers - I suggest you make sure you have a TV with audio and video plugs ready for playback because having the kids watch themselves on the device itself is too risky - 1. They can't hear themselves when you play back the video on the device itself. 2. The camera is small enough to walk off.Disclaimer 2: It looks like there's a port to plug in a microphone on this camera, but so far, even the people at BEST BUY tell me they don't know what microphones are compatible with this device. All the one's I've seen online are $40 and up, so I haven't tried to buy one to experiment with.

Finally I decided to go for a RMA.Video features of the Zi8 are very good, except in low-light conditions. The zoom is almost useless as the video at 3 or 4X becomes very grainy. On-board sound is not good either.The problem is that while I expended $115 for this camcorder, I expended twice as much for accessories, some of them non-useful if I decide to buy another brand in the near future.I never have problems with devices purchased and delivered from Amazon, but this camera was from Willoughbys.

Using both batteries, we can pretty much record all we want during a day of traveling/vacation/etc and then recharge at night.  A week of vacation resulted in ~25GB of mpeg4/quicktime video.  The only drawbacks to the camera is a relatively limited user interface, the need to be careful keeping it clean, 2-3 second delay when taking still pictures, and that the exported video files are in .mov format which may need some extra conversion/processing by software when creating a dvd/blu-ray disk.

Yes, Indoor/low night quality is not that good, but I don't need the picture to be perfect to enjoy footage of my kids.When my first child was born, I already have a Sony Hi8 camcorder sitting around, so I use it to capture his birth and a few special trips.  But, the Sony Hi8 camcorder was too big to carry around with me all the time.  I got the Zi6 over one years ago, it was wonderful, I am able to capture many moment about my kids.  I heard that the indoor/low light get a lot better with Zi8, so I got it last week.  It was great.  The picture quality improved (a lot) for indoor and outdoor over Zi6.These are what I love the most...- small and proable, I have it on me everyday...- take good quality video for the camera of it size- removeable SDHC cardThese are what I have issue/concern-  I love Zi6 that use AA batteries to power.  I use rechargeable AA and I can prechage ton's of them before trips.  Also rechargeable AA is relative low cost and record time are very good as well.  I can record 2 hour of 720p 60fps in 1 set of 2700mA AA batteries. The AA charger and batteries can be use for other electrics as well.  But Zi8 use Li-ion, I end up need to spend an extra $40 for extra KLIC-7004 batteries and charger.-  I have a little concern about the heat, I continues recorded for about 1 hours, the camera was on a tri-pod.

Out of all the portable pocket HD camcorders I would say that this has one of the best quality. Personally, I like it better than the gunstyle camcorder like the Sanyo because the device looks like a cellphone and it won't make people around you nervous when you are filming.That being said, if you are getting this camcorder to also take photos, don't expect much because the photo quality is less than great. I would go as far as to say that it is unusable for taking pictures. The lens for the camcorder has no real focusing abilities so your photos will come out blurrier than a digital camera. It does have a facial recognition feature so that when you are taking portrait shots, it will attempt to focus on the person of interest, but it will still be blurry. If you are outside in good lighting, you can maybe get away with the picture quality as it does take 5 megapixel photos, but taking pictures indoors or less than perfect lighting conditions it will be not as good as a cheap digital camera. *(In fact in low lighting conditions I would actually suggest shooting 1080p videos and then just taking the screenshot out of the video. It will have more grain on it but it seems to be sharper in my experience.)I still think this is a great camcorder and people should get it, but the Zi8 is for people who wants to shoot videos and I would recommend ignoring the picture mode.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does what it said it would", "Author": "M.

This camera is next to useless in low-light conditions. I know night vision or a light is asking a little too much with this price, but it is something worth considering.2. The lens should have come with some sort of protection; it is completely exposed at all times. Invest in a good case if you buy this camera.3. If you have hard to reach USB ports on your computer, you are going to need a USB extension cable.4. I recommend buying a 32GB SDHC card for this camera as it has VERY little internal memory. Cheap 32GB SDHC cards are around $80. This makes the great price not seem as great anymore.5. Video clips are recorded by default in the Apple proprietary .MOV format. The average non-technical user may have trouble playing/converting/editing these files on their system.6. I have noticed that some of my video clips randomly come up as \"corrupted\" when I try to play them back on my machine.

Features that made the difference for me:- Full 1080p resolution.- External microphone jack.- Removable flash storage.- Removable battery.I use it for 2 purposes:  Making YouTube videos of myself (straight shot from a tripod indoors) and also family videos (indoors and outdoors).  It works well for both.Some reviews have said video is too shaky.  My response: use two hands and pan SLOWLY as you move from subject to subject.  For the price and what this camera is, I am very pleased with results in my own hand-held videos.  Due to small size of the Zi8, I catch more spontaneous family moments than if I were still relying on the Sony Handycam HDR-HC3.Also, I am satisfied with low-light performance.  While at Disneyland, I made two sets of videos shot in dark conditions:- The entire length of Small World (which is fairly dark inside for a camera).- The \"Celebrate\" parade at night.Both sets of videos came out well and memorable.  We enjoyed watching them at home on our 46-inch Sony Bravia HD television, running the videos from a Mac Mini which is our media center connected to the TV via HDMI cable.Based on another review of the Kodak Zi8, I bought the Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone, for making YouTube videos.  Low cost and the sound quality is very good.  Reminder: this microphone is mono and Zi8 supports stereo, so remember to get a mono-to-stereo adapter if you use this microphone.I use the Sandisk MicroMate for SD - Card reader ( SD, SDHC ) - Hi-Speed USB.  This is much more convenient than connecting the camera to the PC each time you want to copy your video files over for permanent storage.This camera replaced my Sony Handycam HDR-HC3 (HD tape) because the LCD on the Handycam display suddenly stopped working.  That put me in a squeeze, just when I needed to make YouTube videos.  So I bought the Zi8 because I was in a hurry and assumed I would get a full-featured camcorder later.  Now I'm thinking, the Zi8 works so well, I probably won't get a fully loaded camcorder.This little camera is so cool, why not get 2!

You can only have one.Ultimately, like the others are saying, you will pay a price for quality.  At its best, the Zi8 captures video like a cellphone with a mic input that does it's best at 720p 60fps.Camera came with latest firmware installed, version 1.06Filmed at the beach the other day. Set on 1080P. Played the MOV files raw (just dropped them onto the desktop) through quicktime. Viewed on work monitor, home monitor and on my 40\" sony 1080p set. They all had the same results.  Choppy & blurry playback.I did a test of both 720 & 1080 with & without Image stabilization & Face Detection. I did not notice much of a difference with IS & FD. The video seemed unchanged whether they were on or off. I didn't like any 30 fps format (720 or 1080). The 60 FPS is the best format to record in. I found the 60fps dramatically reduced the motion blur and the video was much more smooth.The pictures it takes are really no different then a cell phone at say, 3.2 mpxs.In fact, the video, also reminds me of the vid my cell phone takes (lg envy touch/Dare). If my cell phone took video at 1080, the performance would be comparable to the zi8, or perhaps any pocketcam.The user interface, imo, is terrible. They could have easily put text on the screen to explain the icons. Very basic control. the Macro button is in a weird place. Macro adjusts whether you want to focus on near or far objects. I would imagine if you had to change this while you are filming you would hear the \"click\" as you move the slider and it would be impossible to keep the cam from moving.I just cannot keep this thing steady at all. Before this I shot on a Panasonic MiniDV and the filming was tight. Maybe a little too stiff. Was the panny THAT much better at image stabilization or was the style easier to hold which helped I.S.? I cannot keep the zi8 steady while walking at all.An interview with good lighting on a tripod, assuming the people aren't moving around a lot, 720p 60fps, is where this camera is at.Considering its price point, I think it would serve well for \"fooling around\" video. If I were to get something for personal use, I would splurge for a handheld and not go pocketcam route, hoping that the image stabilization and blur reduction would be better. I would also stay away from this MOV format. Never again!", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid digital video camera with microphone jack", "Author": "Joseph L.

The setup was easy. The initial uploading of a video to facebook is a little slow, but the video looks and sounds great. She uses a HDSC memory card and the videos come out nice and clear.

So my review might be not as objective as you'd like. My excuses.Pro:- Video quality in good lightning is awesome! It won't beat pro camcorders for sure, but for its price quality is just stunning! 1080p/30 gives you lots of details for steady views, while 720/60 provides stability on the go.- Camera is compact and perfectly fits my pockets. I can take it wherever I want, without the need of case.- It is very easy to control: just power it on and press \"red\" button! That's it! All camera settings are at the distance of 2-3 clicks.- Camera supports external microphones through standard 3.5mm jack. I haven't tried this feature yet (I just don't have external microphone), but from \"YouTube\" videos which I saw, nice external microphone definitely improves the quality of recorded sound. So I consider this feature as a plus.Contra:- Low-light shots aren't perfect: video becomes noisy and details are lost.- Camera comes without memory card, and internal memory size is ridiculously small - just 15 megs. So if you plan to buy Zi8 consider to reserve some additional 20-30 bucks for SD card.- Zi8 construction does not provide any protection to the lenses, and there's always a risk to put some dust and scratches on it.- Camera has nice macro (~15cm) and landscape mode (~2+ meters away). But if you'll try to film something in between 15cm and 2m away from Zi8, then camera just won't focus on it. Yep, clear self-vids are impossible, unless you're not as tall as a Navi. :)Not sure:- Someone says that battery life isn't enough, but it's OK for me, I can barely imagine the situation where 1+ hour of continuous filming won't be enough.Overall:If you're planning to use camera in nice lightning conditions, and you're not the fan of self-vids, and you already have SD card or some extra money for it, then go and buy Zi8!

It was a good value but so far I am disappointed.  It shoots at 1080p, which seems to be the only resolution worth using, but that comes with its own problems.  If you use the digital zoom in the camera the resolution and crispness of the image is horribly degraded.  my old VHS tape are better.  the 1080p videos do not work well on my old MAC laptop computer and the still pictures are of very poor quality.  I bought an ipod nano video and except for its inability to shoot in as low light conditions as the kodak, it is way better to use.  Even my iphone does a better job.

I'm planning to use XVGA for my college classes though, as they look crisp as well but use a lot less memory.Unfortunaly there is not an easy way share the video quality since youtube or any streaming site limit the frecuency a lot.The only drawback I found so far is the MediaImpression software, it's kinda slow even for simple tasks as cut or trim videos, I wish this function would be available directly on the camcorder, of course I understand that for this price it would be impossible.I would really like to have the lens in 45 degree angle so you could record while you watch the screen as a cell phone.I'm very happy with my purchase", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Zi8", "Author": "Bridget M.

Anything that is about 2 feet or closer to the camera, you can use the micro focus. Anything past roughly 5 feet and you use the macro. The problem is between about 2 and 5 feet things are not as clear or crisp.I did not get the flip because it does not record in true HD and you can't expand memory and you can't swap batteries.

However, after reading the reviews decided that the picture taking capabilities along with the digital video was a feature we wanted.  The Zi8 is comparable in size to the Flip.  The picture & video quality is wonderful - clear, sharp, vibrant colors.  Didn't expect much from the microphone, and got what I expected.  The biggest frustration and disappointment is the zoom feature.  While filming the camera zooms in jerky-stages.  There is no smooth transition while zooming, the camera essentially zooms in start-stop steps.  And when the camera gets the the highest level of zoom it does something weird to the lighting, in that the picture goes dark.  When I try to zoom in on faces in a group in the distance, the brightness is cut in half, until I zoom back out and then the lighting goes back to normal.  I can't figure out if there is a setting I'm missing, or it's just a quirk of the camera.So other than the zooming issues, we're happy with the camera.

There is no case for this camera and this is a big problem for me because if its a pocket cam, intended to be carried around in your pocket, the lens and the glossy body, get all the furry particles and dust from your pockets. Its been hard to find a case that will fit in you pocket, most of them are small since digital cameras and phones are getting tinier and tinier, so I would really like to see a case for this cam that will still allow you to fit it in your pocket.

You can't view your Zi8 video with other generic software and the software that comes with the camcorder -- for lack of a more civilized word -- simply sucks.Also the video does not always line up with the sound coming in from the external mic.  Sometimes it's ok, sometimes there is delay.  Sometimes the video is choppy.  Plus the quality control is questionable because my charger will not charge.So back it goes!

Compact, ease of use, price, et., etc.First Issue: You don't simply remove the media card and plug and play on your computer. Although the video files are there the computer (HP Touchsmart/Vista Home Premium) does not recognize them, nor does Windows Media Center. So now you have to search out a media conversion software... OK... Search out and download VLC Media player software, I should be set.Second Issue: I went out and shot some test clips. The lens is not \"normal\". To get a decent shot of what you want set the camera on full wide angle and walk back 20 feet, then MAYBE you'll get a decent, full framing of your subject matter. For what I'd be shooting, I'd never have to use the telephoto.Third Issue, Even with \"stabilization\" ON, and full wide angle, hand-held shots are bouncing all over the place. Note, I can shoot a SLR, hand held, down to 1/8 sec., without blur, so it's not my hands causing the problem, it's solely due to the Kodak camera and lens.Fourth Issue: Back on the computer and I find no simple way to edit the clips. Again, Windows Movie Maker doesn't read the files and VLC doesn't make it easy to basic editing (merge clips), if at all.Fifth Issue: The Kodak Z8i continually freezes up. The ON-OFF button doesn't even allow turn off.

I had already received a charger, mic and silicon sleeve for the camera, but checking into things a little more found out I could use earbuds for a mic, so I returned the camera and mic, and ordered another Zi8 to replace it.

You can get all the pros and cons from other reviews.  In my opinion, the Zi8 is great for what it is.  The external Mic was a must for my applications.  The original camera worked fine. I was happy enough to order more.I ordered two more cameras from Amazon because I wanted one for my wife and one for a teleprompter.  (I am now a full time internet marketer and use the Zi8 for online videos.)My order was for 4 items.  Two cameras, a battery and an SDHC card.  The cameras came in the battery and the SDHC card never did.  Strike one for Amazon.Of the two Zi8s that came in 1 was defective upon arrival.  One was fine.  I saw a picture on the defective one for about 2 seconds...literally.  I got a replacement sent from Amazon immediately no problem and the defective camera is replaced.  Kudos to Amazon for such quick turn around.Unfortunately, it took a MONTH to get the battery.  The SDHC card never came in.  It still shows in route from 2 months ago from the tracking info on them. I called the battery company (Thememstore) & was told \"nothing they could/would do about it.\"  Great customer service.  Amazon did resend the SDHC card, overnighted it and I got it.  As I said the original SDHC card NEVER came in.Next I got billed for never returning the defective camera.  Only problem is I did and have all the tracking info to prove it.I call customer service to straighten it out and get someone from who knows where (India?) and she didn't even know how the return policy worked & I could hardly understand her.  Good grief! Strike two and three.  I got off the phone and still don't know what she said.  I will wait to see if my credit card got charges reversed.Happy with the Zi8s.  Not totally happy with Amazon.  I am a prime customer and have MANY orders with them.  So I MUST say this is the first order they have messed up and they TOTALLY messed this up front to back.

It is perfect for those who are not particularly computer savvy.  The Kodak Instruction Guide is clear and easy to follow, but, if truth be told, most of the features are able to be easily intuited.  I had the most difficulty with opening the SD slot (which is actually quite easy, since it slides off), since I kept thinking I needed to pull something out.  I shot some video of my daughter, downloaded it to the computer and then to Facebook without a problem.  Downloading was a breeze, since the camera comes with a slideout USB.  Very convenient.  Did I mention how cute it is? Can't wait to take this on my cruise.  The only flaw I can discern is the inability to adjust to lowlight.  I had a higher-end camera that could do that, which is very useful for nighttime soccer games and such, but it was so big that it made it a chore to take anywhere. It was also a lot more expensive.  With the Zi8, I can put it in my purse and go. At $129 bucks, this is a great little device.  I'm a fan.  Moreover, when the UPS driver screwed up my order, and accidentally delivered my device elsewhere, Amazon provided hassle-free customer service and shipped me a new one out right away.

The menus are easy to use, it turns on quickly and shooting video is  quite easy.  I have found that I like shooting at 720p/60fps in most situations.  I took some video of a night time radio control car race and was impressed with the fairly low light performance.

I have had no issues with the internal mic (no high pitched noise that others have complained about).  I find the internal mic to be quite useful though voices far away are a little hard to hear.On the down side, the lens needs to be wider angle.  I find that I am constantly backing up to get everything I want in frame.  Also, when shooting in low light conditions, after zooming 3 or 4 steps the exposure goes dark.  I have learned not to zoom to far when shooting low light.  The digital zoom moves in steps.

The camera performed ok but I did not feel the EIS (Image stabilization) was anything to write home about. The picture quality when I was stopped at red lights was decent but nothing comparable to my old Canon HV10 (both recording at 720p). The biggest letdown for me was when I took the camera to record my Daughter's recital (in an auditorium) where the stage was pretty well lit (at least that's what I thought). Since I was sitting right in the front row, I thought I will be able to get some good footage. The footage was adequate when I had it at no zoom. But the minute I zoomed even a little bit, it pix-elated like crazy and the resulting video had so many artifacts that the video looked terrible. The issue was compounded by the fact that the small screen did not show any noticeable issues (when recording) and I saw these issues after I got home and hooked up the camcorder to the computer to download the .MOV files. Boy, what a let down. Thankfully, I was able to sell the camera locally on craigslist.

I wanted something that I could carry around and use to take quick videos of the kids and occasional pictures so that I would NOT have to carry around a separate small digital camera.  I wasn't expecting it to be like an $800 camera or anything, just simple and easy.  Here are my issues:Camcorder - It is a camcorder in the sense that it CAN take videos.  HOWEVER, you have VERY limited features in taking said videos (and even less in pictures).  The actual picture quality on the VIDEOS is wonderful.  I have no complaint there whatsoever.  My complaint is with the stabilization of the picture.  Unless you have the camera on a tripod, your picture is going to be shaky.  On playback (especially on a television) it actually makes you quite dizzy.  If you happen to be walking while shooting video, forget it.  You have to be as still as possible.  There is an image stabilization setting (it's either \"off\" or \"on\") which is useless.Still photos - This is where I have the biggest problem with this device.  Here is what I expected:  To just be able to get a clean image that can be viewed on a computer.  No big deal.  I know that there is no flash, fine - I'll take my pictures in well-lit areas; I know that I don't have ANY options for the lens (save landscape and macro mode) - fine I don't need a professional image, just a normal picture.  The problem is that any photo you take between 2-5 feet away is BLURRY!  Actually, a better description is probably fuzzy.  I took dozens of photos of my children - all of which looked fine on the tiny camera screen, but when I uploaded them onto the computer, they were completely useless!  They look exactly like a picture taken with a cell-phone.  All I want is a clean, clear image - nothing fancy.  When I contacted Kodak (on the phone for 1 1/2 hours) they told me to turn on the EIS (which was already on) and then they told me that they didn't know WHAT to tell me!  I even e-mailed them 4 separate examples of my photos and do you know what they said??  This:\"...unfortunately this cannot be corrected by a repair. The Zi8 is a pocket video camera and its capability to capture still images is just an added feature on this video camera that other pocket camcorders does not have. The lens type of the Zi8 is limited to fixed focus only while the CCD total pixels is only 5.3 MP.\"So basically, they say that the quality of the camera is crummy.  It's funny because Kodak brags in all their descriptions about the still images like this: \"Start bragging with amazing 5 MP, 16:9 widescreen HD still pictures\".  All Kodak said to me was, \"sorry, but if you need help in the future, let us know.\"  I NEED HELP NOW!It's disappointing because the video quality is great, but you just can't watch them afterwards because it's so shaky and obnoxious.  The sill photos are useless UNLESS it's a wide shot from 10 feet away or more.  The things I loved about this camera were the fact that you could plug it straight into the computer and it could even charge that way; I love that you can use memory cards instead of internal memory like the Flip camera; I liked the accessories that it came with (cables to hook it up to the TV).  I know that Kodak is coming out with another camera in September, but the description says that the still pictures are just 5MP just like their current models.  Too bad.  Maybe the picture stabilization will be better.By the way, I was able to return it to Amazon so I'll keep looking for a better product.

A lot of people are getting the two different units of speed confused, and it is confusing to the novice.These are not super high end products they are consumer grade and the video bit rate of the 720p/1080p is around 9 to 12 megabits per second.  You can DO THE MATH yourself.  Here's how:1) Format your SD card in your camera2) Select either 720p @ 60 fps / 1080p (they'll give you roughly the same)3) Write down how much time on a BLANK SD card you will have in minutes (example 1:33 would be 93 minutes)4) Write down how many gigabytes you have and multiply it by 1000 (the cards are 1000 megabytes per GB not 1024)5) take the number of megabytes and divide it by the number of MINUTES6) take this number and divide it by 60 (to get it in seconds)7) The NUMBER you have is how many MEGABYTES / SECOND your device ESTIMATES it will write at.NOTE) The actual data rate (the number you got) can be slightly more or a lot less depending on compression.My device tells me it will write 1.48 MEGABYTES / SECOND.

Gekov", "ReviewID": "R3TAJF02D0R6BN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Summary:  This camera is for people who don't care about image qualityImage Quality: The Kodak Zi8 image quality is quite poor compared to what I was hoping for.  If a camera is advertised as having HD video capability, then I would expect it to be less grainy and pixelated in average light conditions.  It performs very poorly in lower light conditions (e.g. inside a house).The image looks really good on the small screen on the camera itself, but on anything larger, such as my 46\" plasma, it makes me want to dig my eyes out with a spoon.  I have not tried the still image function and don't plan on wasting time using thie Zi8 as a still camera.Ease of Use: It is pretty easy to use and turns on quickly.Image Stability: Also, the camera is supposed to have image stabilization, but it seems that the IS doesn't help.  I have a steady hand and make great effort to keep my panning smooth and my still shots steady, but I think that since the lens is in the same plane as my hand (picture the difference between the longer, larger video cameras vs. the little flat ones like the Zi8 and flip), any slight shakiness in the hand transfers to the camera and this slight motion is exaggerated by the very quick radial velocity of the motion.  I thought about this for a while, because I just couldn't figure out why things were so jerky.  When I use a \"normal\", old school video camera with a hand strap, my shots are super smooth and stable- none of that Blair Witch jerkiness that makes it look like a toddler was filming.  Sure, it has a tripod provision, but I use the camera to capture quick moments and don't have time to set up a tripod.Bottom line is that you sacrifice SO MUCH quality for the convenience of the small size and ease of use.  It is my first compact video camera and my last, until the quality of compact CCD, lenses, and video processing produces an image that is pleasing to my eyes.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "zi8 review", "Author": "Richard L.

If you view on a 20\" monitor or bigger, it is very grainy. The motion is very poor as well. If your pan across your room, it is VERY choppy, even at the highest setting.IS this a good replacement for a real camcorder? probably not. But because of its portability, you will be able to catch all the little moments that you normally wouldn't, because you don't carry your bulky camcorder everywhere you go.I don't have any real experience with any other HD mini cams.

Brody", "ReviewID": "R3HZVROP3JYV4I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not going to do a video review like a lot of other people did, but I can say that I'm not too impressed with this camera.  As you can see, this is a verified Amazon.com purchase, so I did my homework.  I read the good, and the bad reviews before buying.  I came away from reading the reviews, thinking this was a worthwhile investment.  Well, I only paid $100-something bucks.  I didn't go broke buying it, but I expected better than this.The quality of the build of the camera is very poor.  It's almost seems like it's hollow on the inside.  Made of cheap plastic, very light material.  Not impressive.  It also looks pretty outdated.  Looks like one of the first ever Blackberry models or something.  Lastly, I still haven't figured out (in about a month), how to take good videos.  They're either too quick (especially on the 720p setting), or they're too jumpy (especially on the 1080p setting), or the quality isn't good (on the lower settings).720p - The shot is just too fast, especially in the sports mode, which it becomes a ridiculously fast shot.  Even though it's in normal mode, it almost seems like it's in fast motion when you play back videos.1080p - The quality of the picture is very good, but forget it if you have ANY sort of movement whatsoever, or you're doing a panning shot.  The SLIGHTEST quick movement looks jumpy and awkward, and if you don't hold the camera 100% steady, the quality is all jumpy and all over the place.In the lower settings, the quality just isn't good enough, but the timing is a little more on point.  If I wanted low quality shots, I would have just used my Blackberry Torch, which has a 5.0 Megapixel camera, and a standard video camera in it.All in all, not impressed at all, and I may consider selling mine while it has some retail value.Who are the 2 bozos who gave me a negative review?  I thought the idea of the rating system here was to give feedback, so people could make a proper buying decision.  How is my review a \"bad\" review?  I'm honest, open, and forthcoming.

Unless the camera is held completely still, video shot with EIS is just as shaky as if it were shot without (I've done some test shots to see if this is the case).  My Apple iMovie software, when analyzing the resultant video for stability, rejects most of what I've shot because it's simply too bouncy.  This includes video shot while sitting still and moving the camera as carefully as possible.  I'm using the latest version of the firmware (v1.6), so can't blame it on that, either.

The camera is quite easy to use and well designed in most ways.  However, it is a fixed-focus camera.  Therefore, even though it has good depth of field, many of the things you video will be either too close or too far away to be in good focus.  Therefore, the benefits of HD are lost a lot of the time.  Actually, the focus is switchable between normal (mountains symbol) and macro (flower symbol), but the macro position focuses too close up to be useful for filming people.  Autofocus would make this a much better camera.Sony makes a similar pocket-size camcorder that includes autofocus.  (I saw it demonstrated in a store.)

The video is shaky - it is disturbing to watch. The 1080 mode is worse. The stills are a joke. The zoom is digital only. I can't get over how bad the video was, in retrospect. The Zi8 needs a tripod to remain still - since the stabilization is useless.I can only say that one clear 720p video winner here was the Panasonic ZS3 - wow! It beat the SD1 in color, stablization, and convenience. It is a great 12MP camera as well, with a 12X optical zoom. Amazing video clarity. Sure, it is a $350 camera but this comes closest to the one convergence product out there.

In short, the picture quality in low-light conditions is simply terrible. Unwatchable terrible. It is dark, grainy and fuzzy. And by 'low-light' I am not talking about being in closet with the doors closed and the lights off. I am talking about anywhere indoors normally illuminated by traditional artificial lighting (like in your house). I repeat that...anywhere indoors. I even purchased a light to go with the camera and the indoor video is still terrible. The only place this camera works acceptably well is outside in the bright daylight-illuminated world. This makes the camera worthless in my opinion. Who wants a camera that effectively cannot be used indoors?  I thought I might be able to get an HD camera on the cheap. My needs are not excessive.

When a product claims that it will do HD video, and take pictures, then that's what I expect.  There is no expectation here, I'm clearly basing my opinion on the products advertising. I don't understand how reviewers can hack other reviewers like they have no right to complaint about a product.  What gives them the right.  Trust me, these companies are interested in one thing only, \"Market Share\".  If someone does not like this product and either has to spend more for better quality, or just realized that a unit half the price does the same job, then that is the ultimate purchase, to each his own!Now being an amateur photographer and videographer, and somewhat of a tech guru, I can be a bit biased.  This is not going to be some long-winded review, I just would like to share my thoughts and hope that anyone who reads this will know what to expect when purchasing a Kodak pocket camcorder.So, for $100, it does a pretty good job of what it claims to do.  But, how well it does it is where I'm going to complain. I originally watched the video on my PC, using the SD card.  I find it completely useless connecting the Kodak with the built-in USB connector and have it physically hang down from my PC.  USB wired connectors are small and standard, not sure why these companies think that users can't plug a cable...  Anyway, video sucked watching through Quicktime.  So, then I proceeded to download the movies to my media player (Xtreamer), which is connected via HDMI to my 1080p Plasma.  And the quality was significantly better, but still very choppy.  Grainy I can understand because the video was not shot on a cloud-lit sunny perfect day.  I did not bother trying to connect the Kodak camera via HDMI directly to the TV because I won't be using it that way.  If I'm not satisfied with the quality of the video in the manner that I choose to view it, then there is no point continuing.  I will only sacrifice so much quality for size and convenience.I'm the type of person that would rather have a good quality 720p than having 1080p video for the sake of just having it.  My belief is that camera quality stems primarily from the lens.  And because I'll be shooting video indoors in low lit situations, I will look for or wait until a product satifies my basic requirements.

Needs a mini tripod to stand on it's own.  Internal mic doesn't sound great outdoors, too much wind noise. No flash for indoor stills.Things I like about the Zi8. It has a mic input. WVGA mode 848 by 480 and 720p @ 60 fps. Records while plugged into the outlet without using batteries. Very portable and easy to use. Accepts SDHC cards.Improvements:It would be great if the settings I currently have are saved so when I turn it back on again, it would still be on those settings or save multiple settings. (edit: settings are saved except for mic gain setting) It would be also good if it were able to turn off the red light during recording and the snap sound while taking stills.Notes: Since the image stabilization is not that great (didn't expect it to be) I record video by attaching a mini tripod to it and grasp the tripod legs for more stability while shooting. I use the Sony EMC-DS30P microphone along with the Zi8 to produce better sound. It also came with a wind screen. I ordered on Amazon for 30 or so dollars. I also have a small bag/case that fits my mini tripod, extra battery, Sony mic, Zi8 and a compact Canon digi cam for my stills. Also I got the 3 dollar \"back up\" battery here on Amazon. Arcsoft or whatever software that comes with it is okay but nothing to write home about. I just drag the files from my Zi8 to my computer then use Cyberlink's PowerDirector 8 to edit video and upload straight to youtube! I got the black Zi8 but I really wanted the raspberry one. What I'm going to end up doing, since I'm going to the Philippines soon, I will be G masking it(custom skin) for a cool distinct look.  check out [...]All in all it is a great inexpensive video camera that takes nice video and great sound (from external mic) but does not replace my small point and shoot cam for stills.

This is only true if you own a laptop or your USB ports are at the bottom of your desktop. I have a desktop and my ports are midway up the tower. Kodak gives you 3 cables. One for recharging the battery and 2 to attach to TVs. I had to bend over and hold the camera to the USB port to download it. I contacted Kodak to explain the tower problem and asked if I needed to buy a cable of some sort to go from camera to computer. Their response was (a) what is a tower? Do you mean tripod? (b) there is no cable you can buy to help and (c) I should use pillows to hold the camera up to the USB ports.

Now here's the rest...I'm not a pro.  I'm just a dumb guy that wants the Kodak Zi8 camera to work right in the real world.  Here's my experience...First, the sound sucks.  I first used this Kodak Zi8 on the America's Cup sailboat Stars & Stripes.  A once in a lifetime event for me.  Couldn't hear very much.Note:  If I get a good mic that might actually work--it's bigger than the camera!  What's the point of going small!IMPORTANT:  You can't see the screen outside in the real world.  It's shinny black in the sunlight.  So you can't frame the image or see the controls or see the camera turn off because the battery just died.  No alarms.Plus the view is narrow.  A wider angle could give you a chance to catch some of the action by pointing.  But no such luck with this Kodak.Also, the Zoom is way toooo fast.Also, the battery is short, and you can't replace the battery with a tripod on.  You must take the tripod off before you can open the camera.Also, try to hold this Kodak or Flip camera steady.  Can't be done without a steady-cam.The idea of a small high quality video camera is great!--but the reality is not so hot.Do you think Kodak could develop a better mic?Sure they can.Do you think Kodak can develop a quick change battery system?Sure they can.Do you think Kodak can develop a better screen?Yeap.  Sony and the other Japanese camera companies have them.Do you think Kodak can add a better selection of lenses?Sure they can.Do you think Kodak can come up with a reasonable steady-cam system?You bet.Do you think they can make the best little video camera in the world?Why not?  They have a impressive history in still and motion picture film.Then thy don't they and dominate the market... ?The Kodak Zi8 is a good start., a good step in the right direction.Kodak Zi8 Pocket Video Camera (Black)", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "price", "Author": "confused \"reba\"", "ReviewID": "R2VM2PP1R2G813", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the item has been one price for several days.  when you order it, another price comes up. i don't think this is fair and all of you be careful when you order.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wrong Product Shippped", "Author": "Suresh Miami", "ReviewID": "R2WLAMPHMLSSWU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have ordered for Kodak Video Camera.
