Fore example, extra 3rd-party battery is mislabeled for orientation, camera case does not fight (too tight and forget about adding an extra SD flash or battery). Positives are the 64GB SDXC UHS-I SD Sony OEM memory card (SF-64UY), and the portable tripod and cleaning accessories are fine.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Family of Five", "ReviewID": "R6TJ2JD8K3OD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best cameras for it's size and zoom.

I understand if this camera were cheap with no full manual but is not. Why the full manual is not there. I do not want to pay more for an already expensive camera. it does not make sense to me.3 Camera Case. This is another joke, the case is useless. with 2 batteries and the camera is no way to close the zip. IT IS TOO SMALL. What are FOCUS guys thinking.

It has a larger display. The user manual is part of camera's software. In truth the camera's software is extremely useful. It allows you to do post production work on the fly. It also helps a lot when you use the camera in its manual setting. In its automatic setting it does everything for you. The camera fitted in my front jeans pocket without a major bulge. The camera is thicker and heavier than my iPhone 4 with its Otterbox case, The picture quality is good. I was able to take a picture of the moon in in the evening sun with the zoom lens and was able to see the major craters and seas. I was not able to get the same results with only moon light. I got exceptional results during the daytime, and evening  with all settings. The flash works well in all appropriate settings.

I really mean different pictures.  I look for perspective, composition, texture, color, and I like to take pictures of sometimes ordinary objects in ways others don't.  So I say all that to imply that I need a pretty versatile camera, and this fits the bill nicely.  It auto-switches to macro mode (at least in some modes), which I use a lot, captures color pretty well, and good in low-light conditions.I like the controls and their placement.  Having the EV knob right on top instead of in a menu is nice.  It has a powerful zoom, it was one of the reasons I got it - that and manual focus.  The only thing bad about it is that, even though I turned off digital zoom on the menu, it still does the digital zoom, and there is no extra click or anything.  Unless you are looking at it, you can easily spill into the digital zoom part.Here are a couple of other cons:- if you are in the super intelligent auto mode, it says \"processing...\" for about 3 seconds after you take a picture.  You can't take a second picture because the LCD does not show anything while it's processing.  The same is true when you switch modes, it takes several seconds to set up the new mode.- Yes, it does have manual focus but you have to go through the menus to set it.  I would really like to be able to set it on and off with one click, maybe even one more button.  I haven't tried setting the \"custom\" button to do that, but maybe that would work.All in all, though, I am really pleased with the pictures it takes.  It is very versatile and fits in a pocket.
