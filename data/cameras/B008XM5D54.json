{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So Excellent In So Many Ways", "Author": "Sunglass Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R3SHJHVWSNYNJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want the bottom line right up front, it would be hard for me to believe a compact point-and-shoot camera could get any better than this Samsung MV900F, unless you spend way more money, and even then I'm not sure how it would get any better in any practical way. Maybe if you need an attachable speed-flash, or need even more than 5x optical zoom, and maybe, as I used to think, that I needed raw or uncompressed files ( the photos I got from this camera in super-fine quality mode (JPG) are so excellent and fully editable, that I now don't think I need raw or uncompressed files anymore).Now for the more detailed: I've had many digital cameras, even more expensive ones from Nikon, Cannon, and Minolta, and a number of small Cannon 'Elfs'. This time, as usual, I first looked at all the Nikon and Canon models. but was having difficulty finding a highly-rated camera with a FAST lens and at least 3X optical zoom in a compact model without spending between $600 and $1000. Then I saw a review with the MV900F rated as 2nd best out of about 20 new point and shoot cameras. I was skeptical, but not only does this camera have the very fast 5X optical zoom lens, it also has what they call a Back-lit Sensor, which they say significantly helps in low-light, so it's no wonder reviews say it's really easy to take great looking photos, even in low light without flash. I have confirmed that every photo I've taken, without a tripod, with and without flash, without even trying all that hard, has been as perfect as I can see on a 1600 x 1200 computer screen. I just use the Auto Smart mode, the Super-Fine quality setting, and the 1920 x 1080 resolution, because seriousy why would anyone need more resolution than that? One complaint is that you have to first switch to Program Mode in order to see the setting for image Quality. I tried both Program Mode and Auto Smart mode for shooting, and both seem perfectly automatic in every way I noticed.In my opinion, using the bright, high-resolution, 3.3\" LCD Wide-Screen on this camera is not only effectively a single-lens (SLR), because what you see on the screen is through the same lens as the camera, but also you see in real time exactly how focused and light-balanced the photo you are going to take will be. I have not used it in direct sunlight with the sun behind me yet, but they say it is bright enough for that. I don't expect that to be a problem, but if it is I can go back to using my Minolta with a high-resolution peep-hole for those type of shots if necessary.Rotating Screen! Not only for use looking at yourself, but when you rotate it out 45 degrees and flip the camera over above your head, like when you need to take pictures or video when standing behind a crowd, this camera automatically flips the image right-side-up for you.So, lets see, with a super-fast 5x lens, perfect fast autofocus, minimal size and weight, 3.3 inch high-definition rotating wide-screen, and HD video just as starters, this camera already had me convinced at only $248, but then there's more...Touch screen! This might be a negative in the sense that you don't get as many knobs and buttons to do things directly, but what they say in the reviews is true; after a little getting used to, you can get to what you need fast on the tough screen, so that's not a problem, and there just isn't any other way to get that large of a screen on that small of a camera (you need to get rid of all the extra knobs and buttons or make the camera bigger, and I think smaller is better).Built-in WiFI! I haven't used that yet, but if you want it it's in there.HDMI output! You do need to buy a cable with the smaller connector on the camera end.Loads of built-in modes, options, editing abilities, etc, etc.Like I wrote at the beginning, it would be hard for me to believe a compact point-and-shoot camera could get any better without spending way more money.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just got it but....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RT3R68CCTQ4X5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera on Nov. 23, 2012 from Samsung fulfilled by Beach Camera. I received it yesterday, plugged it in. Then woke up this morning to not being able to turn it on. I take out the battery and put it back in and then the red indicator light turns on again and I leave it for a bit. Then the red light indicator turns off which is supposed to mean that it is fully charged and I go to try to turn it on. Green light comes on and flashes and then nothing happens.Contacted Samsung about this. They just referred me to a Service Request.... THIS CAMERA IS NEW OUT OF THE BOX. I've never had any trouble with Samsung before. I will continue to try to see what is wrong with this camera and not charging and update this review. But for now..... this camera is not charging right. Believe me I've checked the outlet, cord, and battery and all are in the correct position and working...Also to note, this camera uses MICRO SD cards.... Not bad, makes it more compact... but I still have yet to test out the functionality because I STILL have yet to turn on the camera. :(Update 11-30-12Figured out that my sandisk class 10 micro SD card was to blame. (Why it wasn't turning on) Also that I needed to reformat it because it had incompatitible content on it after I used it on my phone. Will try that and see how it works... Have to test the rest of the functionality soon. Am going to give it a try over the weekend :) Just took some pics of my dogs and they turned out great tho!! :) Excited! Will update soon :)Update 12-13-12I LOVE this camera. I took it to the oldest cathedral in Chicago and snapped some awesome photos of the architecture. Tried out the panorama feature, video, and low light. I also tried the beauty palette.... Its like instant photoshop and so much fun to play with! It makes some faces look.... well photoshopped. I managed to get another sandisk micro SD 32gb class 10 and it works great! :) I used the flip out portion to get good self shots and shots at awkward angles. Also took some great professional looking shots of my dogs :PThe only thing with this camera is that it is has a slow shutter speed and the photos in dim lighting don't turn out so well... But as far as a sunny day outdoors or well light indoors, it takes great photos. Ultimately it is just what I wanted.

The battery also drains fast so I find that a bit annoying.  Other than that...I really like the camera and it has many of the qualities I was looking for.

I, frankly, was concerned that I had bought a piece of junk.  After all, I bought it for less than I got for my three year old Canon G10 on Ebay.I traded in the G10, which is the top of the line Canon point and shoot, because I was tired of having to download pictures to my computer and then send them by email or upload them to SkyDrive.  Then, there was always the issue of backup.  The camera also took terrible portraits no matter what I tried and had a firmware problem with purple hues and white balance outside.  I like to take macro shots of my flowers and it was tricky to keep it from whiting out.  So, I had been taking most of my pictures on the HTC phone which is actually pretty good, but being a phone without a zooming lens, it fisheyes with close up shots.I wrote all that because this tiny MV900F solved all of those problems and more in my first 24 hours.  We took a birthday self-portrait with the display facing us.  It came out crisp enough to show all of my wrinkles.  And then, I immediately emailed it to my daughter halfway around the world.  My flower shots were perfect on the auto setting.  As crisp and detailed an any I have ever taken.  On the auto setting, the indicator changed from night shot to macro as I walked from my house to daylight.  It selected the focal point but always seemed to get it right (flowers not leaves).Pairing the camera with my wifi was simple as was the setup with SkyDrive and email.  Indeed, I selected this one because it has a specific SkyDrive function.  I sent one to myself by email.  Looks great.  I think that it even automatically reduces the file size for transfer but the resolution is still great on the receiving end.  And, there are many features I have yet to explore.The only downside I have seen is some slowness and jerkiness in the zoom response and slow transfer by wifi.  Indeed, I ended up putting the camera next to the router to send 7 pictures to SkyDrive.  But, hey, for the money?And, of course, these are not professional level photos.

Let me start off by saying that this is a great camera! Picture quality is amazing. All of the different modes for different pictures are fun. My favorite has to be the panoramic mode where you can take a pics while moving camera and get a view of a whole room or maybe like a whole party or skyline. So there are many pros to this camera its quality, size, flip screen, touch screen, and also takes decent videos for a point and shoot camera. There is one thing that is annoying about this camera. I had assumed that i would have no problem with the wifi and connecting to my moms smart phone. Well I thought wrong. On my android phone i had no problems uploading pics from the camera but on my moms brand new top of the line blackberry there is no app for samsung! This may be due to the fact that it is a work phone so i had a backup with the ipad i also got her as a gift for xmas. The i pad has the app, i downloaded and installed but again some technical glitch prevents me or her really from uploading to the ipad. So i thought i was being smart buying a smart camera but the camera is not smart enough! not a big deal to my mom but it is a big deal for me, so basically great camera, great quality but the camera isnt smart enough for all types of smart phones or a brand new i pad 3? Reaslly samsung. MY next move is to call customer service and see if they can help with the connection to the ipad but if they cant resolve the connection issue I should have done a little more research! BUT IN NO WAY AM I SAYING THIS IS A BAD BUY GREAT VALUE GREAT QUALITY! so samsung you got 4 stars from me!

This is the only camera I found in the price range ($100-250) that has a compact size, flip screen and zoom while recording. It also has panorama feature which I didn't have on my old camera.The flip-screen is really handy when I don't want to be too obvious when recording a video. I don't have to hold the camera up by my face, I can put it down and position the screen so I can make sure whatever I'm recording, is positioned properly.At the beginning I was having problems with corrupted videos that would not play back, but I discovered that was because out of habit, I kept trying to stop the videos by pressing on the shutter button on top of the camera (the button used to take photos). Then, thinking I had stopped the video, I would turn off the camera - since the camera was turned off before the video was properly stopped, it would render the video unplayable. We can only start and stop videos by touching the touch-screen. It takes some practice not to automatically use the button on top.Sometimes I have to press the features on the touch screen two or three times before they come up, that's my only gripe with this camera.

While cell phone cameras have improved on the latest iPhone and Android phones, the quality you get from a mid-tier camera is still much better.  This MV900F is very light weight, starts up fast, and has a simple touch-screen menu and minimal buttons.  The picture quality is above average, though not top-notch.  The touch-screen itself is above average, but fingerprint prone and sometimes not sensitive enough.  Didn't try the WIFI option as it's so much faster to transfer photos via plugging the memory card into a laptop.Overall if you use the self portrait (yourself or with a small group of friends), it's a fantastic camera.  The extra fluff of wifi and gesture shots, etc didn't appeal to me.  The multiview itself was the most important feature and it far exceeded my expectation.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad product", "Author": "Rachel Ho", "ReviewID": "R2O8L5UUJVCX4M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the button of the image has some problem!! the image quality is not very good.
