{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung is miles ahead of where it was years ago.", "Author": "Andrew O'hara \"Tech God\"", "ReviewID": "R12IOMT1PYULRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I did a lot of research before buying a camera. I wanted a good compact camera that had decent features, but still worked well. After finding this is looked really nice. But I wanted to distinguish it from others. Like say.. the nikon with the OLED touch display. This one only has the WVGA touch display. Well, after handling them both at a local Best Buy, there is no competition on the screens.The samsung is so much better! Possibly the best touch display, or display in general on a compact camera! It was so quick, responsive and the colors were fantastic. The touch was just as good as the nikon but it also has the accelerometer to go through the pics. Plus you can do stuff like draw an X on the screen to delete them.  Its just so well done.The camera design itself also looks great. It feels strong, sturdy, comfortable. They didn't overlook anything. Theyeven have a slight angle so you can set it down to take self portraits. The shutter button is slightly tilted for better grip.  The screen also covers the whole back except a small spot with grips for your right hand to hold it.The lens is solid too. It takes good photos and the 7x zoom is wonderful.  I like the little daVinci inspired design is cool too. It shows what the lens is by reflection when the lens is extended.  I am a huge fan of Nikon, and this is my first non nikon. But after a lot of researching, and now using, I see why everyone said the schneider kruzach lenses were better than the Nikkor.What is also good to note, is that sure it has a lot of good hardware, but how is the software!?  Well.. its wonderful.  Its just he little things. It has motion tracking so once it focuses it will follow it and snap the photo when the object stops.  It has a good timer, that even adds the motion tracking for a great feature! You set the timer, then go and join the photo, and when everyone stops moving, it will take the picture.  One of my favorite things, that I always had problems with before, was focusing on a obscure part of the photo. You can actually tap on the screen what you want to focus on, and it will!I use a mac, so I don't use anything other than aperture for importing so that will depend on your computer.Overall! This is a great camera. Stand up software, and hardware that can't be beat. Samsung has been iffy for a while especially in the camera area, but after this new line up, they are back in the game. And they are in it to win.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "NEVER GOING BACK TO CANON!!", "Author": "Angela Chin \"lilbitofange\"", "ReviewID": "R3TK8OKDGDCCW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't normally write too many reviews on Amazon, but this Samsung has such limited reviews and it really deserves high praise!After being a lifelong Canon owner, I finally switched to Samsung!  After my Canon broke, I thought I'd just replace it with another Canon like I normally do, but after playing with several models at Best Buy (the SD780, SD1200, SD1300, SD1400, and S90), I found myself completely unsatisfied.  All of them, with the exception of the S90, produced poor image qualities and had very limited features.  Though I was drawn to the small size of the newer canons and the pretty colors, I couldn't get past the feel of the cheap plastic and limited functions.That was when my friend and I started playing around with the Samsung TL240 - we were amazed at the features this camera offered and at a reasonable price!  The camera is completely touchscreen, so there are no buttons to press.  This may seem weird at first, but Samsung did a GREAT JOB at making everything intuitive and easy to find.  The picture quality is amazingly sharp and crystal clear.  It's also a pretty slim and compact camera that can easily fit into your jeans pocket (though not as small as the Canons).  They have some innovative features, like if you draw an X across the screen with your finger you can delete a picture, or if you tilt your camera a certain way you can go into movie mode or program mode.Some other features I love:-  7x Optical Zoom-  Dual image stabilization and smart face recognition-  3.5\" Wide Touch Screen Panel-  \"Smart Auto\" as well as just your typical \"Auto\" - smart auto mode means that when you're in this mode, the camera can automatically detect whether you want to shoot in macro mode, landscape, portrait, night, etc.  It's been pretty accurate so far!-  I LOVE taking food pictures, and the macro mode produces some great close-ups, even in lower light situations.-  Ability to resize and crop photos or alter colors directly within the camera.-  Cool effects like fisheye and vignetting.-  720p HD Video.Oh, but make sure you buy the microSD memory card!  It's teensy tiny compared to the regular SD cards I was used to.  I use the 8gb microSD card and it works just fine!", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "A solid point and shoot w/minimal fail", "Author": "Regina Pribadi \"Ozzallos\"", "ReviewID": "R1C6J8IXB4J10F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After nearly three months of research on other point and shoot cameras for an upcoming trip, I finally stumbled across the newer Samsung lines. It was a tough sell with the minimal amount of reviewing present at the time of purchase, but in the end, I decided to throw in behind the TL240. Here's what we found:The camera itself is solid and well constructed, thankfully lacking the cheap plastic normally found in a sub $200 price range. In terms of ergonomics, the touchscreen solves most of those issues, while any other manual controls are found unobtrusively along the top edge. As for the the touchscreen itself, it's highly useful, bright and responsive. No issues here, though the Smart Gesture feature ended up coming across as gimmicky; even somewhat random.The picture quality is excellent. While the 14mp sensor may have something to do with that, we should all know by now that such things tend to be marketing fluff-- Massive megapixels do not equal a good photo. In this case, however, the TL240 does a great job. Bright light performed as expected, which is to say well. Very few p&s; cameras have issues outdoors, in bright light, etc, and this camera was no exception. Low light snapping came as a surprise. Left to its own devices, the camera's Smart Auto mode consistently produced quality, natural looking pictures of anything with the range of its flash. Higher ISO ranges with minimal lighting began to produce grainy photos, but that comes with the territory.The software also allows considerable manipulation of the photo before and after the shot. While the TL240 isn't my Nikon D40x DSLR, it allows for some basic manual control over setting the photo up and a plethora of post processing option, filters, and even basic photo editing. Remember, you get what you pay for. If you're expecting- ahem -histograms, manual shutter and manual aperture controls, you need to budget more. That said, the camera's Smart Auto tends to do a great job in helping you compose your shots and you're probably better off leaving it in that mode in most cases. Smile detection, blink detection and the other modes do come in handy when needed, especially since they actually work.Ironically, I bought this camera mainly as a video camera. As of the time of this review, the best price to features ratio generally favors point and shoot cameras versus the purpose built camcorders, and in that regard the TL240 does everything I want of it.Video is 720p@30fps optically and electronically stabilized, utilizing the x7 optical zoom and x5 digital zoom (ie; blowing up them pixels). Most of the post processing filters are cut out for video recording, which really doesn't bother me since I consider them mostly fluff features anyway. On the other hand, zoom is enabled during recording and you can opt to mute during zoom to avoid the lens noise or not. On a side note, if you want that on any Canon, you have to find a CHDK Hack compatible model (something I was considering for the longest time). Low light/indoor video performance won't win you any awards at the next Cannes film festival but it's serviceable and probably better than it should be in a camera at this price. In contrast, bright light sources will produce violet banding, though this is an issue seen in prices double the cost of the TL240 and thus not a surprise.The manual states that the camera is \"guaranteed\" to read 4gb micro SD cards, but I can confirm that it reads my 8gb card with no issues whatsoever, and will record approximately 1hr 45min worth of 720p video or nearly 1k worth of pictures at their highest setting. I compared these figures to a 2gb card I had lying around and the calculations bare this out; the camera is reading all 8gb.Things I didn't like? There's not a whole lot to file here:As mentioned, the Smart Gesture UI feels gimmicky and can even become annoying in cases where you need to maneuver your camera in view mode. It will make all sorts of interesting sounds as it rotates your photo in one direction or another while you accidentally rotate the camera physically. Fortunately, you can turn it off.On that note, the USB/power cord is FAR too short. In fact, it barely reaches down to the floor from a standard US wall socket, let alone provide for convenient accessibility from your PC usb connection. I would have rather had a longer cord than the fail, do-nothing plastic docking station they included. A male to female USB extension cable can be had for around $2 bucks (services both camera charging and PC data), likewise the HDMI to mini HDMI for the TV, which is not included.While I'm not opposed to the use of micro SD cards (stop whining and get an adapter, already), the way they squash it in with the battery is obnoxious and you all but need a pair of tweezers to get it in and out.Lower light recording (night time street lighting) caused auto focus issues while reording in all modes. The camera will focus in these conditions before you press record (sometimes), but not while actually recording. We've come to the conclusion that it just either has trouble focusing or it's intentionally disabled at higher ISOs. The lower the light, the slower it focuses until being disabled altogether. I'm still waiting for a reply from Samsung on that one, though it only really impedes filming if you attempt higher zoom levels in the dead of night. Increasing the white balance here seems to help marginally.These aside, it's tough to fault a point and shoot in the $150.00 price range, especially one that offers so much in return. It does everything you ask of it competently and with minimal fuss. Quirks aside, the TL240 is well worth the money.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "No more canon point and shoots for me!! Samsung all the way!", "Author": "ballermike30 \"ballermike30\"", "ReviewID": "R26CHYCDKC626R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really into taking pictures and have a Nikon D90 and had a Canon sd630 point and shoot for years.  My canon was getting old and it was time to get another one.  I immediately started to look at Canon cameras.  I looked at the Canon sd1200, 1300, 1400, s90, and the sd780.  Went to best buy and tried all of the Canons out and wasn't too impressed with the image quality I was use to my sd630.  I had told myself that I would never get a non-Canon point and shoot.  As I was leaving Best Buy, I came across the Samsung TL240.  The sleekness of this camera caught my eye.  It is a beautiful camera and the 3.5\" touchscreen was amazing.  I decided to test out the camera for fun and I was super amazed. First picture I took had amazing image quality.  The touchscreen is very responsive and vibrant.  I went home and began to do my research on this camera.  There are not too many reviews out on this camera.  It is a relatively new camera that just came out in Feb.  Found some youtube video reviews that were very helpful and did some research on the functions on the Samsung website.I decided to buy this camera.  I have had it a few days now and can't put it down.  Let me tell you about some of the functions.  This camera has functions that I never knew existed on a camera.  There is Smart Auto.  When the camera is in this mode, you just place the camera on the image you want to shoot and it automatically selects the best mode to shoot in.  I went in my backyard and rotated the camera on trees and the foliage mode turned on, turned it to my sister and the portrait mode came on.  The touchscreen is amazing.  It has a vibration touch as you click and amazing sound.  When you are in playback mode, you can tilt the camera without touching the screen to flip through pictures.  If you want to delete a photo, simply draw an X on the screen to delete and draw a circle on the screen if you want to rotate the image.  The camera shoots great close up shots in macro and has dual image stabilization.  The camera comes with a wide angle lens that makes shooting landscape easier.  The camera has so many photo effect options including miniature, vignette, and 2 different fish eye controls.  I am not even halfway through the manual and messing around with the functions.  Also shoots 720p HD videoI highly recommend this camera.  I always do a lot of research before I but any electronic and this camera Highly impressed me and is still doing that.

I have a D-SLR, but it's large and heavy. I wanted something I could use to take pictures without having to plan a photo shoot or outing of the like.I chose this camera because of the great specs it has (14.2 mega pixel, 7x Optical zoom), because it shoots HD video as well as still shots, and because it has a touch screen.  The touch screen is very easy to use, and it's quite responsive. It's one of the better non-apple touch screens I've encountered. It has a mess of little extra features, like motion sensitive commands (pressing a specific button on the screen and tilting it one way or another will activate a different function or mode of shooting). It has face detection, which is nice if you need it. It has auto-focus on as a default, but you can turn on one-touch-focus, which allows you to touch anywhere on the screen when preparing a shot and it will focus on that spot. It streamlines the switch over from taking pictures with an iPhone 3gs or 4g, which is good for those who have them. When looking at pictures you've taken, you can either click through the pictures, swipe the screen with a finger, or tilt the camera one way or another. If you don't like those features, though, you can turn them off. Honestly, though they're great.I think it's a great camera. It has a lot of little features, which make the price worth it. You can playback photos with music and different effects. You can also edit pictures in the camera; it has a few basic fixes to pictures like changing the brightness, contrast, light color, and saturation. For most of these features, there's an autocorrect option, which will use standard measures to change it to make it better. You can rotate photos (though the camera does take into consideration the orientation of the camera when snapping pictures). You can apply a variety of filters and effects to the pictures. You can also resize them within the camera. The altered photos are saved as a new image, so you don't lose your original photo. It's great for when you don't have a good photo-editing program, as I currently don't.I'm actually in love with this camera. It has great battery life, a nice flash, and great pictures. It's a perfect size for everyday use; I just throw it in my purse when I'm on my way out and I'm ready for any photo-op while I'm out and about. It's perfect for when I spot beautiful clouds or random little things.  (By the way, if you're worried, as I was, that your camera will get banged up or scratched being in your bag or pocket, I use this case with my camera: Case Logic UP-2 Universal Pockets Medium (Blue).) The camera does seem fairly resistant to scratching though, so it's really up to you. The camera is light though, and it's pretty quick to process commands. It makes me very happy.Overall, it's the best point-and-shoot camera I've ever gotten. I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lots of features for a great price", "Author": "N. J.

I have some older 35 mm cameras like the Canon A2, but wanted something that was light and easy to carry for the trip.  I ended up shooting 600 pictures on the cruise.  I'm very happy with the results.  While I thought I would miss being able to set aperture and shutter speed, for travel on the go a point and shoot worked great.  Some people mentioned the camera freezing in their reviews.  I gave the camera to my niece to take a picture of me at Pompeii. The camera froze after taking the picture.  I thought at first jokingly that my image broke the camera! :) The tl240 had a blank screen and would not power on or off.  So I took out the battery and put it back in.  That solved the lock up.  It was a very hot day too, which could have been part of the problem.  I love the touch screen, but am still learning how to use it.  All in all, a good camera for day to day use.Pros: size and weight.  Love the fact I do not get a sore shoulder after a day of carrying a camera around.  It is so light one hardly notices the weight.  The camera is small enough I could put it into a shirt pocket, but on hot days that did not seem like a good idea since it might get sweaty.Pictures: Good quality.  I think digital at this level still needs a year or two to match that of film though.  I didn't quite fill my 4GB microsd card, but came close.  I shot at the highest quality level and pixels at 14mb.I had a back up card of 8 GB just in case and a back up battery.  The back up battery came in handy a couple of times.  When out for a day in a place like Barcelona or Tunisia, one comes across many things to shoot.  Then I always review my shots to make sure I have the desired shot-which adds to battery consumption.Ease of use.  I was able to take pictures right away with a minimum of instruction.  I did read the pdf file  several times through before going on vacation. Still haven't used a number of it's functions yet.  Will try those in the near future.  Able to power up and snap a picture quickly, which is important when traveling.Cons: At times I wished there was more zoom, but a relative of mine on the cruise had 25x zoom and still wanted more.  Some image is always further away than one would like when taking pictures. :)", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "BEST CAMERA I EVER HAD", "Author": "ARNIE", "ReviewID": "R2XPJFJBF11LLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AFTER HAVING SONY CAMERAS FOR 10 YEARS, THIS SAMSUNG MODEL TL240 HAS MORE FEATURES THEN I HAVE EVER HAD ON A CAMERA FOR THIS PRICE, I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Missing features", "Author": "Orangutanairman", "ReviewID": "R13GBNE7L68MLT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say overall I am happy with my Samsung TL240.
