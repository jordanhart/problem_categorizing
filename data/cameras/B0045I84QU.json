{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice quality kit", "Author": "cell", "ReviewID": "R14Y3QRY54W8GG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say that I am very pleased with this system. I bought it to protect my small business and it does just that! I would honestly say that the quality of these cameras is comparable (if not better) to the $1000+ system I purchased from an installer prior to this one. The night vision works great and the weatherproof cameras just feel like they are built to last. Its a good investment and I LOVE that I can use the remote viewing feature from my iPhone as this allows me to keep tabs on my building regardless of where I am at. The setup of this system is very simple (I did it by myself and am not a professional). Only thing I couldn't do myself is set up the remote viewing. I had to call tech support to have them help me out but they had this up and running within 20 minutes or so. They were very nice and very knowledgeable. They even gave me tips on how to use the pan/tilt/zoom functions of the cameras after describing to them my building and what areas I was trying to get a good view on. Thanks Zmodo for offering a quality product at a good price while still treating your customers with dignity and respect.  I will most definitely keep you in mind for future security purchases!!!", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$643.36", "Features": "16 CH Surveillance Standalone DVR System supports SATA HD up to 2TB\nH.264 Hardware Compression\nBullet Camera: Weatherproof\n1/3\" Sharp Color CCD Image Sensor\n420 TV Lines, Horizontal 6mm Lens", "Name": "Zmodo DVR-DK1690-1TB 16-Channel annel H.264 Surveillance CCTV Security DVR Camera System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MjNPLa8zL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0045I84QU"}}
