{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compact but Capable", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R1UOZV70QNTF4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned the very good Sony DSC-W350 (which I liked very much), but I managed to leave it in a rental car. Between the time I bought my Sony and now, Nikon released a new line, so I figured I'd give one of their best compact point and shoot cameras a try. I use a lot of Nikon's DSLR equipment, but their point-and-shoots have been a bit disappointing to me over the years. But I liked the S8000 and decided to give it a try - and I'm glad I did...it's a wonderful point-and-shoot, even better than the Sony in every way.First, I place a lot of emphasis on the size and shape of the camera and whether it just feels natural in my hands. The S8000 is very small and light, and sometimes really petite cameras just feel awkward to me. I'm happy to say that the S8000 gets it about perfect - it's easy to hold, the controls feel like they're where you expect them, and I never accidentally hit say, the power button when I'm looking for something else. I also tend to like designs that put the lens in the middle of the camera, as opposed to some designs (like the otherwise very good Panasonics) that tend to put the lens off-center. With very little practice, I feel like I can work the Nikon with my eyes closed, and I never feel awkward with it.The built-in LCD monitor is also very good and easy to read under most conditions, except maybe in very bright direct sunlight. Still, my eyes aren't fantastic, but I have no trouble navigating the menus or reviewing shots after I've taken them. As an added plus, the menus are structured in a way that's similar to Nikon's DSLR cameras, so if you're familiar with Nikon's other products, you'll feel right at home here.It's also a fast camera. I don't find the start-up time to be particularly quick, but once you have it on, focus, zooming, shutter lag, flash recycle and so on are very, very fast indeed. The autofocus system seems to be about as fast as the system in my Nikon D3 most of the time, which is really impressive to say the least. With some of the older point and shoots I've owned, I felt like I'd miss shots because of shutter lag or how long it took to focus...not so with the S8000.As for image quality, I have to say that I was skeptical that a 10x lens could perform as well as I want. Honestly, I'd rather have a super sharp 4x than a mediocre 10x, and this was my biggest concern with the Nikon. Well, I'm happy to say that I've been pleasantly surprised by the wide zoom range in the Nikon - this is one really high performance lens, at least when you look at it in combination with all the other features the camera offers. It does great close-ups, letting you focus up to about half an inch from your subject. It seems to have a great optical anti-shake capability, permitting you to hand-hold the camera in fairly dark situations without resorting to a flash. The wide-angle end of the spectrum looks natural without some of the distortions you sometimes see on this type of camera. The worst thing I can say about the lens is that it has some purple fringing at the long end of the range - nothing that can't be fixed in Photoshop, but it is noticeable.Overall, I don't see much difference in the 10x lens on the Nikon versus the excellent 4x lens on my former Sony in terms of image quality. The Nikon seems to produce slightly warmer colors with more saturation and just a generally more vivid appearance. The Sony was more natural looking, but not a lot of difference otherwise. I do notice that Nikon seems to apply slightly less digital sharpening than Sony, but this again is easily corrected in whatever editing software you use if you want to. Frankly, some cameras tend to push the sharpening a bit too far, and portraits tend to come out looking a bit harsh as a result. The Nikon gives you a more natural look that most people will find pleasing - plus you can always add sharpening after the fact if you need to.If you're a novice, one thing to keep in mind is that at the telephoto end of the zoom range, the S8000 is equivalent to a 300mm on a 35mm camera. This offers quite some magnification - but it also amplifies your tendency to get blurry pictures by inadvertently shaking the camera (for instance, as you press the shutter release). Nikon's vibration reduction system helps a lot, but you really need bright lighting (hence, high shutter speeds) to get consistently sharp pictures with this end of the zoom range. I'm sure we'll see subsequent reviewers complaining about fuzzy images at the long end of the zoom range, and no doubt this will be why. As a side note, the camera includes a tripod socket, so it's possible to get perfect pictures in low light, even at the 300mm end of the range - but I rarely see people carrying around a five pound tripod for their six ounce camera.The camera goes out to ISO 3200, but in my use so far, I'd only recommend up to ISO 400 for images you intend to print, maybe 800 for email/web images. Higher ISO than 800 get to look pretty poor, in my opinion. Of course, this is the nature of the beast - these compact cameras have compact image sensors, and that means you just can't boost the sensitivity without introducing lots of noise.The built-in flash is okay, but not super powerful. It does offer uniform lighting over the frame, even when using wide angle views - a pet peeve of mine on other cameras. The S8000 also has automatic red-eye reduction built in, so you rarely see people pictures having lots of red-eye. Of course, I'd rather have great noise-free performance out to ISO 3200 so I don't need the flash in the first place, but absent that, the flash is a reasonable compromise.Nikon includes their venerable D-lighting system, which is essentially a way to bring detail back into the picture when there's a huge contrast variation. It works well, for instance, with many flash shots, or when you have a person standing in the shade against a sunny background. Since you can also add these effects post-processing, I tend to turn the feature off in my cameras, but it does work well overall.There are a few other included features I don't get much use out of. One is the video mode. I suppose if I want to take videos, I'd use a video camera, not a tiny point-and-shoot. Nikon doesn't seem to have put a lot of thought into the video mode anyway...it's \"only\" 720p, and in what seems like a poor design choice, you can't zoom the lens while filming. Another included feature I just don't find myself using is the burst mode that lets you take up to 16 lower quality (3MP) images in a very rapid sequence...generally, if I'm doing high-speed action photography, I'm doing it with my DSLR, not the point-and-shoot. Compared to the Sony I recently owned, there are also no panorama or HDR modes, but honestly, I don't miss either of these.Overall, I think Nikon has a winner here and I absolutely recommend it for anyone wanting a compact but capable point-and-shoot.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera HUGE video flaw", "Author": "F. Morrissey", "ReviewID": "R2IB8SX2BC4IPN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I wanted a camera that could both take high quality pictures of objects from a far away distance and took HD video.  The Quality of the pictures of this camera are good from a far distance.  I could easily read signs when zoomed in that I could not read from looking at them.  I am a structural engineer so I needed something that I could read the structure types and be able to idetify the structures from a distance, in this it did its job.Now the down side of the camera.  The video quality of the video was excellent as well as the sound. The HUGE overlooked flaw is that recording indoors or out there is a high pitched squealing noise in the backround of every video no matter if it was played on lcd, computer, tube tv, or the camera itself.  I tried the camera instore and it did the same thing (after I had taken it home and tested in depth).  I have also seen example videos online where you can here the distinctive squeel.If you are getting this camera for the picture quality only, look no further; but if like me you wanted HD video as well I would suggest looking at another camera.Update***I just purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3, and wow.  When comparing the photos I had saved with the Nikon and now the new photos I have taken of the exact same objects, the Panasonic clearly wins big.  Along with my complaint of the Nikon's video the Panasonic also has a clearer HD video and stereo sound with no annoying whine in the background.  And now the best part. I purchased it off amazon at $235, which is $65 less than the Nikon. I would highly recommend checking out the Panasonic Lumix first.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good performance and beautiful outlook", "Author": "Classic Movie watcher", "ReviewID": "R3GG35YNVWTYBU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a few days' research and testing between Canon S90 and Canon SX210 at 2 shops, I decided to get a Canon S90 for its better image quality.But when I went to a third shop, aiming to get Canon S90, I was shown on the computer screen the 2 photos (jpeg) taken at the same place (indoor) a few seconds ago, one by S90 and one by Nikon S8000. The photo taken by S8000 rendered the true colors, just as what I saw under the lighting, and the image did not have jagged edges as in Canon S80 when magnified at the computer. Then a couple of shots confirmed that the noise control between the two were not as I expected. At least under ISO 400, Nikon S8000 photos did not provide more noise than Canon S90. Actually, at ISO 125, I did observe that Nikon's resolution was better. And the LCD screen resolution of Nikon was also higher than Canon S90. True, Canon S80 allowed one to take RAW images and manual control, but I wanted a travel zoom camera and would not like to work with RAW images or excess processing of the images(otherwise I would take my DSLR.) And Nikon 30mm-300mm provides a much more flexible zoom than Canon's 28mm-105mm.Having Nikon DSLRs myself, I had the impression that DCs were not Nikon's strong areas. But the test shots gave me enough confidence to get a Nikon S8000 back home and gave it a try. Under sunlight, the photos were so pleasing and much better than I have expected from a DC. The image sizes can be either at 4:3 or 16:9. At 300mm, the image is still very acceptable and at 30mm, I detect very little distortion. I mainly shot photos using the AUTO mode but the MACRO and FOOD modes are extremely useful. The FOOD scene, allowing me to change the color tones of the photo, gives such delightful photos of the dishes! To summarise, Nikon S8000 is a very pleasant surprise for me. I got the silver one which had a very solid build and cool design. To top it all, I got a grey Nikon umbrella (which could be used as a reflector) and Coolpix camera bag for free at a local Asia dealer.For the limitations, Nikon's menu seemed to be a bit less user-friendly than the old Panasonic DC I owned.

After comparing similar models from Cannon and Panasonic, I settled on this one. I have not been disappointed at all. The auto mode provides crisp and clear photos, even at very close range. This is very important for a novice photographer such as myself. For users who wish to control the picture output a bit more, there are 15 scene selections and many other advanced image settings choose from. The menus all have contextual help settings to help making selecting from these options a little less daunting.As one of the previous reviewers pointed out, there is a high pitch noise present during video playback. It is not horrible but definitely noticeable. I did not purchase the camera primarily for capturing video, but would be lying if I said the HD recording capability was a feature I overlooked.

Gebhardt \"bsgeb\"", "ReviewID": "R2P1KZZRNBH1EZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a $400 Canon auto-focus, image-stabilizer camera about 2 1/2 years ago and hated it from \"Day One.\"  My husband claimed it was \"operator error,\" until he tried changing every setting to see if he could get it to take decent pictures.  We finally gave up and bought a new camera about one month ago: the Nikon S8000 from amazon.com. I couldn't be happier.  The pictures are awesome with or without the telephoto. Unlike my Canon, the Nikon takes nice pictures in low light situations, or when shooting into the sun (with flash turned \"on.\")  The controls are very intuitive and I like the \"scene\" feature to tell the camera if you are taking a portrait, landscape, night portrait, indoor shot, beach/snow, sunset, dusk/dawn, night landscape, close-up (such as a picture of a flower), etc.  The only negatives I have found are the placement of the flash (as noted by previous reviewers); it's in an awkward place where some people would normally place their left index finger to hold on to the top of the camera.  I also find that the LCD screen is very hard to see in bright (outdoor) light, even when adjusted to the brightest setting it can be. However, I can live with a few minor inconviences as this camera takes just awesome pictures!  I have always loved Nikon cameras and wished my husband had NEVER talked me into the Canon. After two+ years, I am finally ENJOYING photography again!UPDATE -- JULY 21, 2010:  I just returned from an Alaskan cruise and am still in love with this camera. My pictures are incredible and the various scene selectors were very helpful.  I would encourage anyone purchasing this camera to also buy a second battery (and keep a fully charged second battery on hand at all times).  When you receive the low battery indicator, you only have about one or two more photos you can shoot, so there's not a lot of warning that your battery is low.  I charged up both of my batteries every night while on the cruise (took 500 pictures in seven days) so I was always ready for a full day of sightseeing and picture taking.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good-looking, fast-acting", "Author": "Julie R.

Although the picture quality is excellent, the body & kit have flaws.  The included charger only charges a battery while in the camera, making it impossible to continue shooting while charging an assumed second battery at the same time.  At some point you'll have to stop taking pictures to charge. I ordered a charger (MH65) I found & am awaiting for less than $25, that will charge the battery by itself.  Another foible is (at least on my camera) the mini-USB port has a soft plastic cover that does not 'hang' on the camera body; so keep careful track of where you put it while charging or transfering, or it's gone.  This port only indicates \"A/V out.\" I found it confusing to understand that it's also the charging port.  Also, you must keep your left index finger off the top of the camera body or the flash cannot pop up, and you may miss that critical shot.  The SD memory slot arrives empty; with 32 MB internal memory, I opted for a 4GB SD Ultra card.  Except for these annoying shortfalls, overall quality is very good; best points are the great 10X optical zoom lens, typically excellent metering in \"auto scene\" mode, very good motion/vibration elimination, and an excellent quality 3\" viewer/viewfinder.

Its a very straight forward camera as far as using the features but make sure you use them.  The auto \"scene-selector\" mode does an ok job but you're better off if you pick the mode that's the best setting for you on your own.Definitely make use of the \"macro\" mode for close-ups as those pics will turn out fantastic. From what I can see the detail on the pics is wonderful and the lighting looks true as well.I would've given this a 5 star except the fact that to get the best performace you do have to select the mode yourself.Oh yeah, the 10x zoom is a VERY nice feature to have on a compact camera.

It can get frustrating- in the interest of saving batteries, you really can't have the camera on for eight hours a day, so it can be a hassle.Also, being able to adjust exposure manually is too deeply imbedded within menus- again, if you need to adjust quickly, you may be out of luck.The flash location is very poor.

This camera takes very good photos as other Nikon does but I found some issues with its design and functionality that makes me return this camera and I hope Nikon will correct these flaws and I will be able to own a Nikon again. Until then NO NIKON.Design issue:1. Flash - Most of the time it will be blocked by your finger since you don't know when it will automatically pop up. I believe integrated flash is better in that sense for a point and shoot camera.2. Mic - it's on the top of the camera so it records any sound you make during recording a video with your finger (like when zooming)3. Charger - I didn't like the feature that you have to leave the camera connected to USB to charge the battery. What's the problem having a separate battery charger? Anyway the USB charger that comes with it is large.Feature:1. Mostly auto - very little manual setup for photos for a $300 camera.2. Video - extremely bad. This is the main reason I returned the camera. Previous Nikon models you are able to use exposer compensation to take little brighter clips in a low light room, Now that is also auto so in a low light room your clips will be dark. No way to brighten them.3. Another main issue - it capture every noise during video clip recording and makes a clicking sound.So functionality wise half of it's functionality (video) can't be used as expected.

I did not experience the noise that several people described but I did notice a clicking sound on playback.  The sound was created when the zoom was used during recording.

I love the size of this camera, It will easily fit in my pocket and when you hit the power button, it fires up quickly.There are some things that require getting used to. First, the power button is so small, I have to use my finger nail to turn the camera on. Also, if you have the camera set up to automatically use the flash in low light situations, I've found that the index finger of my left hand sits on top of the flash in the closed position, and when it tries to \"pop up\", I get an error message telling me that the flash is not properly deployed. This is more of an operator issue than a problem with the camera. The LCD monitor is hard to see in bright sunlight and forget about viewing the monitor with sunglasses on! I've seen the same problem with my Wife's Canon Powershot, so I'd imagine that this is a pervasive problem with all digital cameras. Lastly, the zoom is a little touchy...almost a little too fast for my taste.The photographs I've taken with this camera are stunning! At times, Its hard to believe I'm using a \"point and shoot\". It's hard to tell the difference between photos I've taken tith the S8000 and one of my digital SLR's with the lens stopped down. The first photo I took was a butterfly sitting on a cone flower in macro mode. The image amazed me! I have taken about 150 photos of my son's high school graduation, shots at the pool, an outdoor party and many indoor photos of family and friends. Colors are accurate and the images are fantastic! My use of the video has been limited to two shoots, approximately 15 minutes each. Several reviewers have complained about a high pitched squeal in the audio. This is not happening with my camera. I have asked my wife and teenage children whether or not they hear any squeal...negative. Since several people have complained about this, it's obvious that this has been a problem. Perhaps Nikon has corrected this. I purchased my camera in June 2010.I guess the last thing to cover is ease of use. I've had the camera for about a month now and still have not read the owner's manual. Everything is so intuitive, I was able to basically unpack it, charge the battery (about 4 hours) and just start using it.

To me, this is antiquated, and this was the only camera I looked at that had this antiquated charge method. Every other camera had a charger that accepted the battery without the camera and plugged directly into the socket without a cord.

So even if the battery charges correctly, it usually took several pushes to get it to come on.The shutter in front of the lens constantly stuck open or closed.The video quality is so poor it's almost not worth using.  The mic is on top of the camera.It can only be charge with a USB cord.  Which is cumbersome if you have to recharge away from home.The camera just overall is unreliable, flimsy, and unpredictable.

Having read reviews of other people and their experience with Nikon service, I'm wondering if it's worth it to try to get it fixed--even if it's under warranty, they may try to accuse me of dropping it and charge me $100 to fix a nearly-new product--and if the camera is that fragile to not withstand normal wear-and-tear, do I want it back?

I was at 22 months with my S8000, sent it in for repair (to the factory) and they took care of everything! Covered new parts, labor, cleaning and return shipping (I had to pay shipping to get it there). Mailed it to them May 29, got it may June 11. I couldn't be happier!!Doesn't matter who the seller is, they just need proof you bought extended coverage and that it's within the covered range.ALSO, now that I have a couple years with this camera, still very happy, but I wish it had a \"sports\" mode to choose like their S3300 and other camera's I've owned.  Other than that, I still love this camera!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought the S8000 having had Olympus Stylus 740 and C50 Zoom camera's.  The Nikon LCD view finder is BY FAR BETTER to see in bright light conditions than the 740 and C50.  Yeah, it could be better, but it's night and day compared to Olympus.Nikon recommends a Class 6 or higher SD card for the S8000 for faster data writing (within the camera).  I bit the bullet with a Class 10 8GB SDHC by Sandisk ($50).  To torment myself, I compared my classless regular 2GB SD card to see how much slower the data writing process was.  With the camera at the highest setting (14M* 4320x3240) and outdoors, it took 1 picture every 3 seconds with either card. (For comparison, my 740 set at SHQ 3072x2304 took 1 picture every 11 seconds).  Then I tried recording in HD.  I'm not sure I can really see a difference using the fast and slow card!  Maybe I'm not under the right conditions to see a difference, but now I question biting a $50 bullet.  The 2GB card was a freebie from my local MicroCenter store.....would have been $6 purchased outright.  I discovered 1 minute of HD video = 62MB for a quicktime movie.  In my situation (basically shooting pictures), a slow card (less than Class 6) probably would have been fine.  Live and learn.Bought the \"ZipKit\" ($25 with shipping) to accessorize the camera....what a great deal!  The kit comes with a USB2.0 SD Card Reader that boosts transfer time.  100MB of pictures took 16 seconds with the USB on the camera, but using the USB Card reader it dropped to 7 seconds with a Class 10 SDHC card, and 8 seconds for a classless SD card.  The reader is the way to go. Obviously Nikon's recommendation for a Class 6+ SD card has nothing to do with getting pitures off of the camera.CASES: the Olympus 202066 Neoprene Case fits this camera better than the 740 it was designed for!  It's not tight and there's room for a couple extra batteries.  I read concerns for the Nikon hard shell case and held off.  Glad I did because I would get another 202066 if I ever wear out the Velcro.Overall I'm happy so far.  I'm wondering about battery life. With my 740, battery life was the weakest link. I was lucky if I got 3 hours (250 pics) per OEM battery (far less with non-OEM batteries).

Yes, it took a bit to remember to not put my finger on the flash but was easy to hold the camera without needing to have my finger on top of the camera.

I have a picture of the Taj Mahal from the distance where people next to it are about the size of grains of sand, or invisible. With the zoom that is built into the camera, after the picture was taken and you were looking at it on the camera, you could zoom in and see people on the front wall near the door of the Taj, and see what they were wearing, and almost make out individual faces! I think the zoom power must be much greater than the 10x they advertise. Also, when you zoom in like that it shows a zoom number in the upper left, (or somewhere) and that number went up to 30 or 36x !  The picture quality is fantastic, and there were only two ways a friends $1,600 camera was better. He had much more zoom than I did with great clarity, and he could take some pictures in low light that I could not get.

I was looking to upgrade my SD880IS to something with HD video capture and a longer optical zoom than the typical 3-4x found in the Canon slim cameras.  I decided to give the Nikon S8000 a try.  Results are definitely mixed.  The most important feature of any camera is its ability to capture great still images, and the S8000 is absolutely superb in this respect.  At full 10x optical zoom, it captures breathtaking images.  Very few slim cameras offer this level of optical zoom, one of the main features I was seeking.  Unfortunately, the HD video capture doesn't enjoy the same success.  I found that an annoying high frequency whistle accompanies all video recording when playing back on my computer, something I never encountered with my Canon products.  Some might describe what I'm hearing as a tinniness to the sound.  In order to use video captures from this camera, I'll have to post-process the video to filter out the frequency of the whistle sound.  Also, the HD video didn't seem smooth, and it kind of had the effect of being captured at a slower fps rate.  A design issue I found with the S8000 was that the pop-up flash is inconveniently placed.  Often when the camera needed to engage the flash, my left pointer finger was resting on top and prevented the flash from lifting.  Nikon likely foresaw this as an ergonomic design problem, and the camera issues an onscreen message to the user saying that the flash was unable to deploy.  Would have been more convenient for the user if Nikon had integrated the flash into the camera body.The negatives on the video capture performance and the flash placement, the S8000 does take beautiful still images.  If you plan to do mostly still shots and want a slim camera with lots of optical zoom, the S8000 would be a great choice.  If you plan to use the S8000 often for video capture, which I was hoping to do, then perhaps wait until Nikon issues a firmware update for the S8000, or perhaps wait until the next post-S8000 release from Nikon.  Canon seems to put out new camera models every year, but I don't know Nikon's plans for their product releases.  If Nikon fixes the noise in the video capture, then my rating would be at least 4 stars, perhaps even 5 stars.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Battery needs help", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R2XLDQ7IBI2739", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a little over a week ago to take to Costa Rica for a mission/vacation trip.

I'd just about decided on the Nikon Coolpix S6000 when I found the S8000 instead. In the past 2 days I've taken about 50 pictures with it. Having had Nikon, Canon & Fuji in the past, I was somewhat familiar with the Nikon menus, so working with the S8000 was not a problem and easy to learn.So far I find the photos have outstanding color, the best I've seen in a point and shoot in the auto mode. If you like over saturated colors, this may not be the camera for you. The pictures are tack sharp...most of the time. One or two of the photos were not at all sharp and it seemed the camera just wasn't quite ready. At the same time, it was the fastest to start up and to be ready for the next shot I've seen in a point and shoot. There was almost no shutter lag. I have not tried all the different modes yet other than macro and video. One big plus to me is its ability to handle strong contrasting light. Video's going from sunlight to shadow were handled well by this camera.I am very disappointed in the videos. While I did not have any audible noise (the audio is great), the movies seem fuzzy to me with muted colors. The Canon's I've used are much better at video than this S8000.The 3\" Clear Color Display is crisp and bright, and adjustable. I really like the fact you can hardly turn this camera on by mistake as the on/off button is slightly recessed and takes a bit if a push. The menu buttons and menu itself are pretty easy to understand and navigate. To turn on the video, you just push the red \"scene\" button on the back of the camera.As for weight and shape, it's very light and thin and seems to fit the hand well.In the box was the usual manual in several languages, a nice camera case and thin cord to put on the camera for a strap. It also came with a 2gig SD card and a fully charged battery so right out of the box it was ready to go. What I did not like is the USB cable that came with it. It's not a standard mini USB connection at the camera end so it seems I have to have this cable and can use none other. It's just so easy to misplace a cable or forget to take one on a trip that I really would prefer a standard connection. The camera can be charged on the computer or at a standard 110 outlet. I don't know if it's 220 ready for travel or not.Because of the cable and the poor video on the camera I'm not sure I'll keep it. Perhaps I can add more info in a couple of days. I will upload a couple of shots taken with it to give you and sampling.UPDATE: Well I decided not to keep the Nikon. Just didn't seem to fit my hand comfortably and the USB cable bothered me. So I picked up a Canon SD960 IS with a much sharper & better video which can be zoomed while filming, a nice feel to the hand, and is smaller in size.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Average sitlls, Horrible VIdeo Quality", "Author": "Jacob L.

It is also a bit delicate and the leaf shutter over the lens when it is closed can get a little sticky.

I ended up keeping the panasonic zs7 instead.  Now the Nikon S8000 does have a more powerful flash than the ZS7, but I found that the panasonic could focus better in low light.  But, if you lock a focus, the S8000 usually gave me a slightly better picture with less noise because the flash was stronger than the ZS7.Outside, I loved the Nikon as well as the ZS7.

Having been a Nikon fan for many years on a professional level I am very disappointed with the physical aspects of the camera. Pictures are great. Screen is great. Didn't use the video so I can't comment on it.First off, I order my camera through Amazon -  THANK GOODNESS!!!!The first two cameras (That's correct; it took three deliveries to get one that worked.) wouldn't charge the battery. That brought up the first short coming : The charger is in the camera therefore, unless you buy a external battery charger and another battery, which of course Nikon has available, you can't use the camera.The body is thin, real thin. I found it necessary to hold the camera with two hands just to avoid dropping it, not steadying it. Where the camera is designed to be held by only your right thumb and index finger is simply not enough. When you use two hands, I found myself holding my left index finger over the \"POP UP\" flash. Last more than one picture that way. Your point of concentration is on the screen more so than where your fingers are placed on the camera.My last Nikon purchase was a P 5100. I realize now why I love that camera. Exrernal Battery Charger. I didn't mind purchasing another battery. It has a \"grip\" in the body allowing you to hold it functionally with one hand. Best of all and something I really wasn't think about, it comes with a neck strape. There are two (2) strap connectors on the P 5100 and only one on the S 8000. I had a hard time holding the S 8000 on my wrist by the very thin strap supplied with the camera. I was affraid of swinging the camera into something whereby breaking it then having Nikon tell me it was my fault. Having a camera in a case on your belt is a waste of time to me. You miss pictures reaching for it and in your hast dropping the camera. I like the camera around my neck, ready!The S 8000 takes great pictures, agreed. It has more setting than I will ever use although someone else might. However, I would rather spend a bit more and get some of the \"accepted as norm\" features that I am used to from Nikon. Built in flash, a camera I can carry around your neck, a \"grip\" so I can use the camera with one hand. I'm sorry Nikon but you need to ask people who use camera what they are looking for before you design it. I hope this helps someone.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Specs - Poor Performance", "Author": "Markel Phelps", "ReviewID": "R7UJDY4DMUBUR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Nikon S8000 through another retailer in the hopes of utilizing a more compact camera system for an upcoming family vacation.  I currently have a Pentax K-7 camera system with three lenses and love it.  However, as great as a the K-7 is, it is a little impractical to use when going to an amusement park with the family. Thus it seemed that the Nikon S8000 would be a perfect solution to take great snapshots of our family vacation in Florida.Thankfully, I did a good going over with this camera, testing its capabilities and picture quality, using various settings and situations.  What I found was that the Nikon name doesn't mean squat when it comes to compact digital cameras.  I was somewhat skiddish with this camera to begin with, as it touts a robust 14 megapixel imaging sensor, a CCD sensor, which can only lead to a sure problem - digital noise. I guess I was hoping Nikon had developed a CCD sensor that could compensate for the noise problem, like that of the Fujifilm EXR technology digital cameras that have just recently come out.  But to my disappointment, it was to no avail.  But, to further complicate matters, the camera as been programed by Nikon engineers to do a lot of heavey noise suppresion, but that in turn causes the pictures to lose quite a bit of detail.  This really rears its ugly head when you may want to crop a picture taken with the Nikon S8000.  The noise compensation programing done with this camera causes many of the pictures to come out with mushy details.  Yes, if you use the lower ISO settings this can be reduced somewhat, but not very well.  To compound matters, if you choose to crop any of the pictures taken with this camera, the noise and mush become that much more magnified.Don't get me wrong, there a some things to like about this camera.  The 921k LCD screen for viewing and composing your pictures is wonderful.  The 10X Nikkor lens (30-300mm# is great for taking picture without the hassle of changing lenses everytime you turnaround.  The playback and editing of images taken on this camera works seemlessly. Even the tackful feel of the rubberized grip area was a nice touch. But if a well designed camera can't pass muster in the image quality department, what do you really have in a camera?  Survey says... Nothing!Since I have now returned the Nikon S8000, I am now trying out two other recent entries that seem to be a little more promising: The Sony HX5v and the Casio EX-FH100).  Neither one of these cameras use a CCD sensor for capturing images, but rather, a CMOS type sensors which helps, but does not totally eliminate, the digital noise issue that has long plagued the point and shoot compact camera market.  I am not trying to be overly critical of Nikon, because they are, no doubt, a leader in the digital SLR market, but work needs to be done to make the Nikon S8000 camera a worthy travel companion camera.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great so far, but I'll surely update as time goes by", "Author": "S.

I contacted Nikon and they provided me with a quote from the owner's manual...\"\"This is not a malfunction.As stated in your User's Manual, \"The sounds of zoom control operation, autofocus lens drive movement and vibration reductions were recorded.\"\"They know about this and put it the manual but not in the specs or on the packaging.

I took this camera with me on many travels, the zoom is AWESOME, captures details you don't notice in real life like faraway signs.

The grip is nice, I don't think your fingers get in the way of the flash so I don't know why people say this is a problem, it hasn't been for me. This is a great camera for macro, you can get up to 1\" away and still focus. Build is great quality, not cheapy plastic but metal and a rubbery grip. Works and looks great after multiple drops (oops). Menu is easy and intuitive, no more than 1 level deep. This is part of the experience which some manufacturers overlook but Nikon did well here. Comes with great panorama software too that is really fun to experiment with.Basically it's a darn good camera for the price, I'd give 4 1/2 stars if I could; solid build; versatile from zoom to macro; takes nice video, etc. but minus half a star for poor flash-off low light performance, vignetting.If you're a beginner-almost-intermediate camera user like me this may as well be a DSLR minus the bulk.

The iPhone however does not have an optical zoom and has relatively low picture resolution. Its digital zoom is very good, but can't make up for the quality of a good optical zoom.I was hoping to achieve Nikon \"professional quality\" output with a camera small enough to carry in my pocket.  Its size is fine. the zoom is fine and it works great for what it is. But after weeks of using it, I've yet to get a single photo which is far and away better than what I've been able to get out of the iPhone. The iPhone is faster to shoot, easier to use, faster to zoom, has much better image firmware (as in the way it sees colors is better), has much better exposer controls - you simple touch the screen on the area you want to \"expose to\". The Nikon is really \" you take what it tells you to take\" no - manual speed or exposure controls to speak of.This Nikon has a low light compensation feature which does in fact let you take pictures in low light - I found that its interpretation of colors at low light was a bit of guessing game - you never knew what it was going to come up with. ( greens look brown, etc)My pleasant surprise on this camera was the video, which I didn't buy it for but find myself using more than ever expected - not being an video expert, I'm impressed with the quality. I'll keep the camera mostly for this reason.In short if you want reliable \"good\" photos, every time,  this is a great camera - but not particularly any better than an iPhone.

Some small details were not well thought out, for example, the rubber tag covering USB port is so difficult to peel off, the wrist stripe can certainly benefit from an extra plastic clip to prevent slipping (like the design cannon uses).The Ugly: Too thick--very inconvenient to carry in the pocket; the mini USB is Nikon specific just a tad smaller than the generic mini-USB (what a shame that Nikon engineers made this non-environment friendly decision--and believe me it's a pain to track and keep the cable when traveling if you also carry other USB cables); Very slow (takes minutes) for a PC to recognize pictures after connected through USB (without installing Nikon software).What can I say--love it and hate it.

I found it in this little camera.  I wanted the ease of a point and shoot with some capabilities of the zoom of my SLR.  I have a Pentax *ist D that I've had for almost 5 yrs now and I love it....but it's sometimes not so easy to haul around on trips and things.  This camera does really great shots IF you know what you're doing.  There are so many settings that it takes a little getting used to!  It's not a difficult camera to work, but the settings weren't what I was used to.  It's not so great at low light pictures with much movement (i.e. I shoot alot of bands in bars & concerts) it has alot of noise and distortion, but for good light it does great pictures.  Outdoors or indoors it does a great job!The video is good quality.  I've been so used to my older video camera with the shaking while shooting that it was a nice surprise when it had the video stability.  People see the videos and say 'Wow! You've got a pretty steady hand!' then I have to laugh!  I've done some videos with my kids' school concerts and things, they seem to turn out really well.All in all, this is a good little camera....but don't be fooled with it's high speed manual zoom....it's not the same as an SLR, but it will work for those occassions I need to pull it out from my purse!  I read the reviews before buying and there are also a few things I would like to note...  The shadows in all of the pictures that people keep talking about, I don't understand.  I have YET to see that in any of my pics!  The flash is DEFINITELY in the wrong spot!  Although I just push it back in when I don't want a flash anyway.  They should have made it a stationary flash instead of pop-up.  There are plenty of things that make this camera worth the price! The 14 MP photos make it easy to crop/zoom without distortions...so what you can't do with the camera, you can with the editing. It's worth the $$.

Well it might if I was happy with the camera. Remember, I am aiming at the camera itself not the pictures. I'll get to the pictures later.First of all, I went through two S8000 before the third one came from Amazon and charged the battery. When the thrid camera came, I call Nikon, directly. I had them walk me through the process of everything from opening the box to plugging in the charger. I found that I had completed the task correctly, as the instruction book stated, twice before. When the third camera came and the battery was charging, I realized I didn't do enough homework. You  charge the battery in the camera unless you purchcase an additional external battery charger. Realize that if you don't have an external battery charger for an additional battery you can't use the camera.I like to be able to hold the camera with one hand. The S8000 is too thin, at least for me, to hold comfortably. There is a small thumb pad in the upper right corner of the body for your thumb and your right index finger holds the camera in front. My right hand shape was not what Nikon used as a guide when making the plans for the S8000.  It felt very uncomfortable holding it with just the right hand. Most of the time I used my left hand as well. I guess most of us put our left thumb under the camera and the left index finger on top. Not a good idea!! The flash is can't pop up if your finger is holding it down. Keep in mind that normally you would be holding the camera with the left hand while adjusting settings with the right hand as the camera is designed to do. Without thinking I would just frame and push the shutter release whereby loosing the picture as the flash couldn't open.Lastly, how much more could it cost to have two connectors for a neck strape instead of one for a wrist strape? I like having the camera hanging down from my neck so I grab it quickly and have my hands free when not holding the camera. Think about walking around all day on vacation not being able to use two hands as one hand has to hold the camera unless you put it away.I will say this, \"it takes great pictures.\" The zoom is excellent. The 3 inch screen is great. Ok, so you can't zoom the lens in the video mode.

Some small details were not well thought out, for example, the rubber tag covering USB port is so difficult to peel off, the wrist stripe can certainly benefit from an extra plastic clip to prevent slipping (like the design cannon uses).The Ugly: Too thick--very inconvenient to carry in the pocket; the mini USB is Nikon specific just a tad smaller than the generic mini-USB (what a shame that Nikon engineers made this non-environment friendly decision--and believe me it's a pain to track and keep the cable when traveling if you also carry other USB cables); Very slow (takes minutes) for a PC to recognize pictures after connected through USB (without installing Nikon software).  Just to be fair to Nikon this could be a Windows7 compatibility issue. I don't know for sure which one, Nikon or Microsoft, is to blame.What can I say--love it and hate it.

I have to say that I'm kind of disappointed. First, maybe it's me but the pictures (especially indoors) don't come out that great.

But my biggest point of contention is where they placed the flash..it's right where you hold the camera. I can't tell you how many times the flash didn't go off because my finger was in the way.

I knew the flash was in a bad position and thought I could contend with that.  It was more of a pain than I anticipated.  I figured that the HD video noise people were describing would have been a malfunction in the camera that they received.  I did not experience the noise that several people described but I did notice a clicking sound on playback.  The sound was created when the zoom was used during recording.  I exchanged the camera for another one thinking it may have been a malfunction in that camera... the replacement did the same thing.  The clicking is loud enough that it really distracts and in some cases covers up sound from the subject your recording.  When you don't use the zoom, the video is great.  I contacted Nikon and they provided me with a quote from the owner's manual...\"\"This is not a malfunction.As stated in your User's Manual, \"The sounds of zoom control operation, autofocus lens drive movement and vibration reductions were recorded.\"\"They know about this and put it the manual but not in the specs or on the packaging.  You don't know about it until after you've made the purchase or read it online.  I am so over Nikon for a while.  I will be returning the second one and looking into other options.
