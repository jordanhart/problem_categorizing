Just the camera and lenses cost as much or more at the big box stores, all the extras made it a great deal. The backpack was the main reason we purchased this package option. It is sturdy and works well for our daughter who takes photos for her school sports team.

IT WAS WELL PACKAGED UP WITH LOTS OF BUBBLE WRAP. I AM HAVING A GREAT TIME LEARNING TO USE IT AND FIGURING OUT HOW ALL TEH STUFF WORKS WITH IT. THE ONLY THING I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH IS THE BACKPACK CAMERA BAG. COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED A BIT BETTER TO HOLE THE CAMERA AND ALSO HOW YOU SLING IT ON YOUR BACK.

I've used it in the past and I'm a fan!  So when I saw this deal I jumped on it! Everything works perfect and I couldn't be anymore happier with everything! I put in the order Tuesday and had it at my house by Thursday morning, with normal delivery... none of that over night crap!  What they don't tell you is it comes with a canon battery and charger already, but that's great anyhow cause you can never have to many batteries and chargers! The flash isn't the greatest but still great for what its worth!  If you have a chance to grab this bundle, DO IT!", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my T3i", "Author": "Ryan Thomas", "ReviewID": "RIB176U72BES3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great christmas deal. I got it for around $600. You can't find all these extras w/lenses for that price. If your starting out this is the DSLR for you. I suggest you also download magic lantern too.

Thank you! I am just starting to play with everything in the box but so far very happy with everything that I have purchased.  I have been shopping around for this camera for a long time and decided that it was time and this was the package I went with.  Absolutely love the feel of the battery pack with the camera, not too heavy and feels great. Very happy. Thank you for your packing, the box had a little damage on the outside but nothing on the inside was hurt because of the great packing on the inside. Again very happy that I made this purchase with you.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect & Comprehinsive bundle", "Author": "Anan Zitawi", "ReviewID": "R18L4GAVVZ3LJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All what you need to start shooting is available in this bundle , 15 items , all are of the high quality , and they are delivered as displayed exactly , also the price is excellent .shooting is more enjoyable with such accessories .", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great kit.", "Author": "Chris Corbett", "ReviewID": "R3UT8DOU8EMION", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lots of stuff in it and it's going to take me a while to get used to all of it.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$669.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\nCanon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens +  Canon EF 75-300mm III Lens +  Zeikos BG-E8 Battery Grip +\nTranscend 32GB SDHC 300x Card +  Spare LP-E8 Battery +  Battery Charger for LP-E8 +  58mm UV Filter +\nAdditional 58mm UV Filter +  PD DSLR Sling Backpack +  Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +  RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\nLCD Screen Protectors +  PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +  PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case +  PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm IS II Lens with 75-300mm III Lens + 32GB Card + Backpack + LED Flash + Grip + Battery Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61nWjIgBtSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GGM9F20"}}
