{"Reviews": [{"Title": "APS-C sensor, Wifi features, good image quality, good value", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "RTEU2FC4TEMY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice kit which has the body and standard kit lens plus the superb 16mm f2.4 wide angle lens.  This is exactly the kit I use, though I purchased the items individually.  The current price asked is fair, but as prices change often, check for yourself!  All in all this is an excellent camera and these are both excellent lenses.  The 20-50mm is excellent. The 16mm is exceptional.Samsung NX1000 Review  (From my review of the White model which is identical except for color):The main things that drew my interest with this camera were the Wifi features (I have a Samsung WB150F and the Wifi features have worked well.  I find them useful and convenient, especially the PC-Autobackup which transfers movies and images to your PC), the large APS-C sensor (more image detail), the compact, mirror-less design, and the recent price drops.The NX1100 will debut with a MSP of $599 (vs. $699 for the NX1000) and comes bundled with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 and some new Wifi features - namely Autoshare.  But guess what?  Autoshare is available for the NX1000 in the 1.13 firmware update!  I already own Adobe Photoshop LR 4, and even with the lower NX1100 price, the NX1000 (basically the same camera) at current prices (340-360) is a great value.  Compared to models like the 200/210 it offers the exact same APS-C sensor and is almost identical in image quality and handling.  what you are giving up is the AMOLED display, metal body and a few other minor things.  (The LCD display on the 1000/1100 is fine, if not quite as good as far as contrast, deep blacks, it is still very usable.)So...how does the pudding taste? Well, I will admit my overwhelming first impression was \"plastic!\" - though the build quality seems very good, there is an overall \"plasticky\" feel to the NX1000.  (Thankfully, the tripod thread is metal!)  The shutter and other bits are metal as well, including the lens mounts.I use Panasonic and Olympus cameras, mostly, and even those in this price range have a bit nicer \"feel\" in that sense  But, it's a very high quality plastic and I soon got over it except for the fact that I find the grip a bit slick and could see myself dropping this camera, so I immediately attached the strap.  Not a big fan of the strap.  It's OK, but I do not like the ring attachments used versus the more usual cloth through metal guides on my other cameras.  I find the strap interfering with my grip due to where the attachment rings are located and this is quite annoying.  I will probably remove this strap for that reason once I find a case I like.  You can work around it, but I just don't like it.  (Update: I'm adjusting to this and not as irritating as before.)While we're quibbling, I'm also not a big fan of the way the Zoom lens \"locks\" when not in use.  It does give a lower profile, but it takes some getting used to, as I've never experienced this design before.  Again, a minor thing.  Overall appearance is good, it looks like a serious camera.  I got the white model and like the \"Elvis vibe\" it gives off.  Also the markings are easy to read, it's comfortable to hold (with the 20-50mm lens) and the recessed mode dial is a nice touch.  (It's even better with the awesome 16mm wide angle pancake lens!  Much slimmer profile and very easy to hold and shoot with.)In general, as far as controls, the design is well thought out and Samsung offers some unique and original twists such as the \"Fn\" and \"iFn\" control buttons which allow easy access to the main things you'd want to \"tweak\" when shooting.  The controls work well and the \"ring/wheel\" control works very well.  I was a bit skeptical, but in use I really liked it.  For example, when flipping through your shots in playback mode it works very well and you can scroll through the images very quickly.Nice to have the hotshoe, though I have not tried the flash unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!In general, I find the NX1000 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \"boost\" many cameras give by default, there is a \"Vivid\" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \"Smart Camera app\" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \"open folder\" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.There is a \"Smart Range\" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online reviews, so I won't dwell on it here.  Overall, I found the camera responsive and adequate for my needs.The LCD screen is bright, colorful and has good resolution.  I was pleased with it.  I generally favor optical view finders (sorry, I admit to being old school here, you can't beat a good optical VF IMHO) and even EVF in a pinch, but I am getting used to the non-VF style of shooting and the NX1000 LCD is very good in this respect.In general, I am very pleased with the image quality and the feature set and think this camera is an excellent value at current prices.  Many of the features are unique, the Wifi modes are the best I've seen to date, and the  APS-C sensor seems to be a good one.  It's fairly compact with the 20-50mm kit lens (and would be even more so with the 30mm pancake lens), easy to carry (not heavy), and has all the controls you could ever want.  The images are very good and that's the main thing.I think it's an easy 4 stars for overall quality and especially value for the price paid.----------------Update: I recently purchased the Samsung f2.4 16mm wide angle \"pancake\" lens (Samsung 16mm f/2.4 NX Ultra Wide Pancake Lens (Black)) and it's a great addition to this camera.  Wonderful for landscapes and walk-about/street photography.  It's the lens I keep on the camera by default now.  Quicker auto-focus, faster optics(f2.4 vs f3.5), and a more compact profile.  When I have the 16mm lens on the body, I feel this is a 5 star combo.  (I am leaving the rating at 4 stars with the kit lens, which is an excellent lens.  I just find the 16mm to be the \"magic\" lens with this body. Very subjective, of course.)Update:  I did not cover video very well above, suffice to say the quality of the video is excellent for a camera in this price range and superior to many, I would guess.  It is full HD 30/60 fps.  You can Zoom during video shooting and it supports external microphones and stereo sound.  All the basics are here and a few pluses as well.  You can even use many of the special effects in video mode should you wish to do so.  There is a dedicated video button for instant access, and a dial selection for more options.  Videos take longer to transfer over wifi due to their size, but do transfer fine.  Sound quality id pretty good for a camera of this type, in my opinion.  So, if you are traveling, you have both stills and video covered.  (I still feel a dedicated video camera and full fledged DSLR are optimal. But I must say, the combo capabilities here are quite fine.)Video Format: MP4 (H.264), Compression: Movie H.264, Sound AACFrame Rate: 60fps (1280 x 720 Only), 30fps (1920 x 1080), 24fps (1920 x 810)Image Sizes: 1920 x 1080, 1920 x 810, 1280 x 720 , 640 x 480, 320x240 for Sharing (Default: 1920 x 1080)Movie Editing: Still Image Capture, Time TrimmingUpdate: I did not mention that the kit lens (20-50mm) does not have image stabilization, nor does the body.  Has not been a problem for me (I shoot old school, bracing, etc.), but it was a consideration in buying the low cost and excellent 16mm wide angle for this body (very compact and little worries about image stabilization, larger sensor works in favor here) and dedicating this to camera to the wide end, while using my Panasonic G1 for the mid/telephoto range (as I already have excellent lenses for my G1 in this range).  I still have the 20-50mm (an excellent lens) in the bag and can switch when needed.  The lenses I have already for my G1 are superb, so this works out well for me.You can buy image stabilized Samsung lenses (like the 18-55mm) if that is a concern.  Shooting with the 20-50mm kit lens, I never once had any issues.  However, in low light situations, it might come into play.  Again, in my case, my G1 and f1.7 20mm would be my preferred choice, but I could get by with the NX1000.  It has good image quality at high ISO and even ISO 3200 is usable many times.  ISO 1600 is very good and ISO 800 is very clean.For quick \"grab and go\" shooting, I continue to enjoy this camera very much.Also, see my review of the 16mm f2.4 lens here: Samsung 16mm f/2.4 NX Ultra Wide Pancake Lens (Black)", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Instant Sharing via WiFi\n1080P Full HD Stereo Movie Recording\nHigh Speed Capture\nPanorama, 3D Panorama\nWide Range ISO for Perfect Exposure", "Name": "Samsung NX1000 Smart Wi-Fi Digital Camera Body & 20-50mm & 16mm f/2.4 Lens (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZOdP8F4vL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008EM4I0Y"}}
