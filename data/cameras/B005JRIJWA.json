{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My first micro four thirds camera", "Author": "mypotbelly", "ReviewID": "R3T15QV9DUBZ4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (4/27/2012)==============Note about Olympus service. It turns out that my camera had an issue with taking picture at fast shutter speed (1/4000s). I called the service and sent it in. It was fixed by week's end, and was shipped it out by 2nd Day Air. It was all for free as my camera is still under warranty. I did not get a refurbished unit; I got mine back. When I tested my 'fixed' camera, I found everything was working as expected and no more problems at high shutter speed. Big kudos for Olympus service!Update (2/6/2012)==============One key feature I forgot to mention is the in-body image stablization (IBIS). Olympus has the IBIS whereas Panasonic only supports the IS built into the lens. There are PROs and CONs of IBIS. However this comes in handy in many cases, and I prefer camera having IBIS where some lenses do not come with IS built-in (OIS). Some of my lenses do not have OIS, and if I do not use IBIS on Olympus, images would not be as sharp. On the other hand, people say that IBIS is not ideal for the video recording. I have not noticed much, but I can see how.On the other hand, Olympus will announce E-M5 (OM-D family) this week. This one will support 5 axis IS (still an IBIS) which is expected to be much better than the IBIS that current models have. Some on the DPREVIEW forum say that this one will be better than OIS... we'll have to wait for some product review for the verdict.Important Update (11/21/2011)=====================Firmware version 1.1 is now available from Olympus. It was surprising from a company that is going through a financial trouble :) The firmware version 1.1 is supposed to address an issue with EyeFi (Wifi SD + memory) card. Although I do not use the EyeFi card, I thought I will give it a try and updated my camera with some worries as one reviewer on DPREVIEW.com reported that camera became 'brick' after the update.I used 'Olympus Digital Camera Updater' software that came with my camera. I used my Mac Mini to update the firmware. Everything took less than 2 minutes, and I got large \"OK\" sign on the LCD display. Upon recycling the power, the camera reported firmware version 1.1 correctly. I took about 50 shots after the update, and so far so good.My original review============This is my fourth camera purchase this year... yet this is the best one. My other three cameras were point-and-shoot cameras that gave me some good photos but in-door shots with high iso gave me very grainy images. Nikon P300 is pretty good with F1.8; however image sensor was little too small and that results in lower image quality in some occasion.I also have Canon T1i which takes photos with really good image quality; however I run into the portability issue. I'm not as big of a photo enthusiast (I know... I just love buying new camera) and I do not feel comfortable carrying my Canon T1i everywhere. It is simply too bulky.My definition of 'perfect' camera is one that I can take most everywhere and take photos with good image quality in every situation.I did a lot of research for the 'perfect' camera, and I quickly came down to the following selections:1) Sony NEX family - Sony NEX 3, 5, C3, 5N, and 7.-------------------------------------------------------------These are wonderful camera. Small, and versatile, and especially with APS-C size image sensor, image quality (IQ) rivals regular dSLRs. However the limitations are the fact that they use Sony proprietary lenses and there are limited number of NEX lenses.2) Samsung N100/N200-------------------------------------------------------------These are similar to Sony NEX. I haven't seen them in person; however these should deliver similar IQ with the APS-C size sensors. However they do have the same issue of using Samsung proprietary lens mount + format.3) Nikon 1, Pentax Q, and Fujifilm X100-------------------------------------------------------------Ok, Fujifilm X100 has APS-C size sensor; however it has a single fixed lens on the camera. Good lens, but you cannot replace lens. Nikon and Pentax recently announced their new compact system cameras, however their system uses smaller size sensor. Pentax uses even smaller and Nikon uses sensor about 1/2 of Micro Four Thirds. I like Nikon but I felt the lens collection + size sensor was disappointment at this time.4) Then there are Micro Four Thirds cameras... these include Olympus e-P1,P2,P3, e-PL1,PL2,PL3, and e-PM1 and Panasonic GF1, GF2, and GF3, and other G series cameras.-------------------------------------------------------------Micro Four Thirds cameras can use any lenses that adhere to the Micro Four Thirds standards. Therefore there are more lens selections available at the time of my research than any other compact system cameras.My decision was more of my budget and my future direction... I want to build my lens library first; however I wanted to get best value for my budget. In my opinion, Olympus e-PM1 was the best choice.My selection of Olympus E-PM1 was for its compact size and versatility of the camera. yes, it may not have all physical control buttons. That was problem when I was looking at the camera; however it's not as bad as I thought. You can get to the settings quickly and you actually have control of most of settings that you can think of... And you can easily set your focus area, if you don't want the camera to choose for you :)Based on my research Olympus E-PM1 has pretty much the same hardware as more expensive and little bigger E-PL3. This means that it now has new dual core image processor (TruePic VI) and very fast auto-focus system. This all means that this Olympus E-PM1 is very responsive and good performer in everyday use.It's been about a week and I took almost 900 photos with single battery charge(battery life is good). I now have Panasonic 20mm F1.7 pancake lens on the camera and that one is really good for photo taking. (I won't recommend it for video.. due to noise issue). With my F/1.7 lens, I haven't really had need for a flash on the camera. In fact, I have not even tried it yet. Camera takes good IQ and very fast auto focus. I love how i can control so many settings on the camera. I don't think I had this much fun with my Canon T1i.NOTE: For Mac users out there, this ACHVD format on 1080i video would be little problem as there are no native support for the format yet.Pros for Olympus E-PM1--------------------------------------------------------------- Compact size (smaller than other micro four thirds)- Good Image Quality (comparable to dSLRs)- Fast auto focus speed- large number of available lenses (micro four thirds)- Available Hot Shoe; you can use external flashCons for Olympus E-PM1--------------------------------------------------------------- no built-in flash (having something is better than nothing)- not pocketable, unless you are talking about your winter jacket- Limited availability of button control; it's ok but for some this would be strong 'con\"- Video format (ACHVD MTS format is not for computer... Mac software not as widely available)- Built-in image stabilization may not work perfectly for the video; it works well for still images.- (UPDATE 11/15/2011) It may be my camera, however I cannot use shutter speed 1/3200 or 1/4000s. Images get too dark at the bottom of picture. However I rarely need these shutter speed; therefore I do not see this is a show stopper.* Image Sensor size discussion--------------------------------------------------------------Here are some measure of image sensors used on various digital cameras today:Typical point-and-shoot, sensor=1/2.33\", sensor size=~28.5mm^2, crop factor=5.62Advanced point-and-shoot, sensor=1/1.6\", sensor size=~48.6mm^2, crop factor=4.3micro-four-thirds, sensor=MFT, sensor size=~225mm^2, crop factor=2Canon dSLR, sensor=APS-C, sensor size=~329mm^2, crop factor=1.6Other dSLR (Nikon,Sony), sensor=APS-C, sensor size=~369mm^2, crop factor=1.5Olympus E-PM1 has micro four thirds format sensor, i.e. it has surface area of 225mm^2 which is significantly larger than typical point-and-shoot camera.  Olympus E-PM1 has more than 4.6x bigger image sensor to pick up more lights than advanced point-and-shoot camera.* Comparison between Point-and-Shoot and Olympus E-PM1------------------------------------------------------------------Olympus E-PM1, as a micro four thirds camera, has significantly bigger MOS sensor and you can go to ISO1600 and still have good image quality. I posted an example of image that was taken with ISO1600 with F11. This still has fairly good image quality even with high ISO. Of course, the image quality would be less accurate in dimly lit condition. However Olympus E-PM1 still has much better image quality than other point-and-shoot camera. I compared picture taken with Olympus E-PM1 and Nikon P300, and Olympus wins hands down.* Olympus E-PM1 User Interface-----------------------------------------------------------------As noted above, Olympus E-PM1 does not have as many manual control buttons. You don't even have 'mode' button. P/A/S/M has to be selected via menu button. Although this may be problem for some users, many users will find it adequate. There are even customizable buttons that you can assign \"video record\" button as \"DOF preview\". Other controls, such as changing ISO, aperture value, shutter speed, are fairly simple. Olympus E-PM1 gives you so much control over camera settings.* RAW image format (Updated 11/15/2011)--------------------------------------------------------------------Olympus E-PM1 has good RAW image setting (.ORF format).  Included Olympus Viewer 2 software can be used to develop RAW images into JPG format images.I am happy to report that the following software support E-PM1 ORF format:- Adobe Element 9 with the latest update (ACR 6.5 and later)- Aperture 3.2.1Summary---------------------------------------------------------------------Olympus E-PM1 is a solid camera with good functionalities. It is small enough to be almost pocketable yet provides many advanced functionalities that rivals entry level dSLRs. As a micro four thirds camera, there are good set of lenses from multiple manufacturers, and Olympus has built very responsive camera with good image quality (IQ) sensor with this E-PM1. This camera should appeal to those of you looking to move up to more advanced camera from their point-and-shoot camera or someone with dSRLs looking for a smaller, competent camera. I do admit that this camera is not 'perfect' camera; however this camera is one of the best value for a compact system camera today.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that Olympus won't tell you", "Author": "thsu", "ReviewID": "RSLBLLKEBP5GO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for a few weeks now, so I just wanted write a few notes about this camera that get neglected.1. The image stabilization is only good up to 4 fps, but the default multi shot modes are 5 fps or 3 fps. To get 4 fps, you have to use a custom menu setting.2. Always shoot in multi shot mode. Single shot mode will cause camera lag (my guess is that it waits for the SD card to finish writing in single shot mode). This lowers your shot to shot times down to about 1.5 fps as the camera will just ignore your shutter press. Shooting in multi shot mode solves this problem, at the expense of not always seeing your next shot.3. Buy the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens if you want to take any indoor shots without a flash. The kit lens, at f3.5, is just not fast enough indoors. Your shots will come out at 1600 ISO and contain blur or noise, depending upon your noise filtering setting, usually both, because f3.5, just doesn't cut it. Okay, that might be a little harsh - if you reduce the photos down to 25% of their original size, they will be good enough to put up on a web page, but you wouldn't want to print them. In comparison, the 20mm f1.7 lens takes great indoor shots.4. Nearly all the pictures you see on websites that review this camera required custom menu settings. Custom menu settings require information from the manual before you figure them out. I must have played with the custom settings for a solid two hours with the manual by my side, before I got things close to the way I wanted them.Edit (03-Oct-2011)5. The auto focus speed using the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens is slower than with the 14-42 kit lens. While the 20mm focuses nearly instantly in bright light, it can take up to 2 seconds to focus in low light. Comparatively, the 14-42mm has a worst case focusing time of about half a second in low light.Edit (28-Nov-2011)6. Buy a grip for this camera. I got a small Flipbac G2 and it made a world of difference.7. These days I would recommend the fast focusing Panasonic/Leica 25mm/f1.4 (or Olympus 45mm f1.8) over the 20mm/f1.7 for low light photography.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "5-star, great value!", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R1KRM1Z0MO1HW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using E-PM1 for a couple of weeks. It's very nicely build and appears to be metal front, back or sides and the top (E-PL2 has only metal front panel). The menu is cleverly designed so you won't miss the additional external controls all that much. Rec button and \"right\" & \"down\" buttons can be customized. E.g., you can set Rec button to serve as AEL/AFL, AF/MF switch, \"Magnify\", \"Tele-converter\", etc. In addition, if you turn off \"keep WB warm\" in the menu (it's on by default), the colors will be much better especially indoors. Don't forget to dial flash exposure compesation \"+1EV\" (the camera will remember this setting) for proper exposure because the bundled flash is always in semi-bounce position when activated.Overall, great little camera with super fast AF (incl. continous AF in HD video), fast buffer clearing with a huge number of customizations available. 5.5fps burst mode and art filter bracketing is really cool. So far my basic settings: Noise filter off, \"keep WB warm\" off, Sharpening -1, Natural picture mode, right button - ISO, down button - WB, LSF jpeg, Rec button set as AF/MF switch, LCD set to max brightness. Also, don't forget to enable SCP (Super control panel) by clicking OK, then pressing Info in live view mode. This will allow you a one-click access to all important settings for changes on the go. E-PM1 feels like a very thoroughly designed camera with well thought out menu. It does require some setting up to do initially for best resutls. It has a hot shoe and supports standard flashes as well as wireless flashes (with bundled flash attached). Buil-in Image stabilization is very effective especially with Panasonic 20mm lens you can easily shoot sharp pictures of non-moving objects at 1/10s w/o any blur. Priced at $499 it's definately the best value for the money in the m43 format.Update: After 2 months of heavy use, it's hard for me to go back to E-PL2 now (my back up camera). E-PM1 trumps it in every way: better looking images (due to outstanding AWB performance), much faster AF and face detect especially in low light or when shooting from a distance. Much improved shutter lag and very useful 5.5 fps burst mode. The bundled flash is tiny and provides great results; I don't hesitate to leave it attached most of the time (good in the sun too to lift the shadows).However, IBIS is disappointing compared to E-PL2 so I simply disabled it (I'm mostly taking pictures of people anyway and prefer at least 1/30s so no biggie. I heard E-P3 IBIS is way better - different implementation).I sold Panny 20mm because this lens is slow and noisy to focus (especially in low light it's often inaccurate) and it doesn't take advantage of E-PM1's fast AF at all. Panny 14mm works way better for me including in low light (good DoF in tight indoor spaces). I used to keep Panny 20 for shallow DoF but now I got Oly 45mm f1.8 which is way better at that.Absolutely breathing pictures from E-PM1+Oly 45mm combo with creamy smooth bokeh and surgical sharpness in plane of focus (have to use e-portrait function to smoothen the skin, LOL). 35 small AF points covering the whole screen are indispensable when shooting wide open with this lens. Also, E-PM1 eye detect is very useful for artistic portraits (e.g. the focus is on the left eye).I really think that with m43 and Oly 45mm (I also recommend ND filter) anyone can now take pro grade shallow DoF (with 3D pop) pictures w/o any training at all because no PP required! E-PM1's jpegs are superb, very colorful and especially fantastic skin tones even under mixed indoor lightning! You can spend hours editing raw files and still not achieve the Oly colors (especially skin tones).I also wanted to add that E-PM1 is fun to use. Not only because of the cute form factor but also thanks to some useful art filters, e-portrait function, burst mode and full manual control over video. If you use non-TTL external flash, you are no longer restricted to 1/160s flash sync speed. You can now use 1/320s in 4:3 native aspect ratio and 1/400s in 16:9 format. Very few cameras are capable of such high native flash sync speeds (w/o power-reducing FP mode). For those who can't afford Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, Olympus Viewer 2 which is bundled with the camera is a very capable editor albeit works slower than those two. It allows you to apply any of the art filters after the picture is taking (if shot in Raw) and you can apply most of the in-camera settings to your raw images later (picture mode, WB, art filter, noise reduction, sharpness, etc.). It's probably the best free image editor I've ever seen.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fits My Niche", "Author": "Jeffrey P. Schneider \"fstopman\"", "ReviewID": "R28WB1YKID7E56", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Olympus has marketed this camera as a step up for a P&S; user, but I think it's really most appealing to the experienced DSLR user who sometimes wants to carry lighter gear.I use a Nikon D200 DSLR as my main camera, with a lot of legacy manual-focus Nikkor glass.  For casual snaps/travelling light I have a Canon G9 P&S;, which has good manual controls, but a very small sensor, a poor optical viewfinder and a non-interchangeable zoom lens.Recently I saw a very good deal on the e-pm1 with 14-42 kit lens, and decided to try it.  What might turn off P&S; shooters, but really intrigued me, are the extensive options for customization.  It takes some time to go through the entire setup menu, but if you are an experienced photographer, it's easily understandable.  Finally, what sealed the deal for me was that micro 4/3 cameras (because of their very short flange-focal plane distance) can be fitted with adapters to use just about any DSLR lens you might already have (though of course the FOV will not be the same, except with 4/3 lenses).What I've learned since buying the camera:1) Handling is easy after a little acclimation;2) New users should check the micro 4/3 forum and other websites for user advice/experience to help customize the settings for your particular preferences;3) An optional electronic viewfinder is really nice to have in bright sunlight, when composing (and even more so, manual focusing) using the LCD can be difficult;4) Cheap adapters for manual focus lenses work just fine (though expect the lenses to actually focus a bit beyond infinity);5) Autofocus with the kit lens is very fast, and this lens has a nice throw for manual focusing, too.Comparing the E-PM1 with the larger and more expensive cameras in the Olympus Pen series, what's really different is that the E-PM1 LCD is not a touchscreen, and it's fixed; there are also fewer buttons, meaning that it will take two or three button pushes rather than one to change mode (PASM), for example.  Since I don't use most buttons often anyway (even on the D200), I actually like the less cluttered layout of the Mini.The E-PM1 is now my favorite camera for urban photography - it's no effort to carry it everywhere I go, on foot or by bike.  It doesn't attract attention, and delivers the kind of images I want.To sum up, a newbie could use this camera as a P&S; with interchangeable lenses, and have fun with it.  But it has a lot more to offer than that for an experienced photographer - especially one who wants to see, not be seen.  The ability to use pretty much any legacy glass is a nice plus for us old-timers.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R99YRWQ419Z1D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background:I've owned quite a few Olympus four-thirds cameras. My first was an E-420, which was compact for it's time, but performed horribly in dim lighting and I refused to go beyond ISO 400. My next purchase was an E-620 which was a good improvement and I was comfortable at going up to ISO 800. My last purchase was an E-5, which in my opinion is perhaps the best four-thirds camera thus far. The E-5 addressed many of the issues I had with four-thirds, and I currently use it for my portrait/fashion work as the detail and colors are outstanding.Build Quality:Similar to all my Olympus purchases, the E-PM1 is very well built. It has a nice metal body, reasonably light and small. I do wish it had a better grip for one handed use, though those instances are very rare. If you hold the camera like a DSLR (one hand near the shutter and the other underneath the lens), it is very easy and comfortable to hold.Controls:At first, I was hesitant to use a camera that didn't have individual wheels for shutter and aperture as well as a lack of other dedicated buttons, but I found the menu interface quite intuitive and I was able to change settings quite quickly. I believe seasoned DSLR owners as well as people upgrading from point & shoots will be comfortable with the controls.Image Quality:I decided to pick up the E-PM1 to supplement the E-5, since the sensor and and anti-aliasing filter was reported to be similar. Compared to the E-5, the images seem to have more shadow noise, but it's more refined grain. In some instances, I have also noticed some blotching as well, whereas images from my E-5 would not have them at all. Quite perplexing, since the sensors are supposedly quite similar. While the noise seems more apparent, I'm still comfortable going up to ISO 1600 without noise reduction, and up to ISO 3200 with noise reduction. Beyond ISO 3200, images become unusable.Lenses:My current glass for the E-5 consist of the Olympus 50mm f/2 macro and Panasonic Leica 25mm f1.4 - both of which are quite sharp. Which is why I was a little disappointed in the kit 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. While small and compact, it doesn't do the sensor justice. I received the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 and am very pleased with the quality and sharpness of the images it's producing in conjunction with the new sensor. I also have the 45mm f/1.8 on order and I expect it to produce outstanding images as well. The kit 14-42mm is fine for the general consumer and as a travel lens, but if you're serious about photography, I recommend fast prime lenses: Panasonic 20mm f/1.7, Panasonic 25mm f/1.4, Olympus 12mm f/2, or the Olympus 45mm f/1.8.Summary:Great little camera, and if you want to get everything it has to offer, new lenses would be in your cart as well.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very pleased-", "Author": "Clever Name Goes Here", "ReviewID": "R1EBAHRDWFQRR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go into the nuts and bolts of what the micro four thirds format is about, as there are plenty of resources out there to consult if you want to learn about system cameras. The short of it is that this is part of a standardized format of system cameras-meaning it has interchangeable lenses-that are meant to put a large image sensor into a small camera body, giving users the ability to get high quality shots without having to carry a DSLR around. The recent trend with these small system cameras seems to market them toward the more casual user looking to step up from the ailing point-and-shoot market to something a bit more capable. Despite the fact that the functionality of these new small system cameras is downplayed (I am sure as to not appear intimidating to people who are not devoted to intensely learning about camera operation and photography), these models, this one included, are entirely capable of taking very, very high quality photos and allow a great amount of control over every aspect of your shot, should you desire it.Honestly though, with the advances in auto-focus accuracy, white balance metering, etc. etc., these cameras will be just fine when left on \"P\" mode (automatic settings), or just used with simple shutter or aperture priority modes, since they do a fine job at handling the technical stuff; you don't need to constantly fiddle with them to get excellent results.If I am doing a more formal photo shoot, I will use my DSLR, but for the kinds of picture I take most of the time, I just want a camera that is fast and ready, and not a chore or liability to carry around. This camera doesn't draw attention to itself, and is very fast- but at the same time, can take serious quality photos that will not leave you disappointed, even if you are a serious photographer with fairly high expectations (just remember to use a good lens if you really want to push things).I have been a big fan of the m 4/3 format over other small system cameras for some time now. As we are seeing the release of other competing models with larger APS-C sized sensors (the same size as in Canon's non full frame DSLR's), such as the Sony NEX series, there is a temptation to give them a go (the NEX cameras are very nice, by the way, but the lenses leave something to be desired when it comes to sharpness, in my humble opinion).But... there is another factor to consider- unlike other large sensor, small system cameras, m 4/3 is widely supported in terms of lens availability, so the range and quality of lenses you can get for m 4/3 is in another league compared to proprietary systems such as the ones from Sony and Samsung. If you are familiar with cameras, you will know that the camera body is only part of the equation, and that the quality of the lens used can make a HUGE difference...Anyway, this is my second m 4/3 camera, and is a replacement for an Olympus EP-2. Olympus has priced this camera (the E-PM1) very, very competitively. In my opinion, this is the best bang for your buck out there with small system cameras. As soon as I learned this camera shared many key electronics with the EP-3, but packed into a smaller package, I knew I had to upgrade. The auto-focus is very, very fast, noticeably more so than the EP-2. I cannot comment on the kit lens this comes with, since I went straight to using the fan favorite Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 with this; though I hear good things about the kit lens.Another major selling point for me in regards to this camera is the size. I am pretty sure this is the smallest m 4/3 camera out there, and with a pancake lens it is easy to carry around in a coat pocket, unlike the more classically styled, but bulkier, heavier EP-1/2/3.This model also benefits from having Olympus's \"new\" type of menu system, which is mercifully simple to use compared to their older cameras.The image quality is fantastic, as is to be expected from most any modern m 4/3 camera, and if you are used to point and shoots, the pictures this takes will be a revelation in detail and richness. JPEG's look great, and RAW files are even nicer, and like past Olympus cameras, the color rendition is exceptionally pleasing. Because of its compact size, I use this more often than my DSLR, and I would definitely buy it again.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "DSLR user Bought this for a Trip", "Author": "Betsy B \"threeboysmama\"", "ReviewID": "REFV9U0RB6WLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip, not wanting to carry my Nikon DX DSLR around, but I was worried about image quality with a four-thirds, so I took it out and shot about 50 or 60 pics with it, and the same ones with my Nikon before my trip. I was very impressed. Honestly, even pixel-peeping at full-size images on the computer, the differences are negligible. I have no problem recommending the Olympus to ANYONE. I had no issues finding controls without ever looking at the manual, and, after a little more practice,I think I could do almost anything with it that I can do with the Nikon.This camera is ideal for a semi-pro shooting for fun- it's a LOT lighter than a DSLR- and, as much as I really wanted to like the Nikon better, I'd recommend this camera whole-heartedly, while giving the Nikon a list of \"but\"s. The Olympus, for instance, focuses MUCH faster than the Nikon, even in low-light situations, and on full auto \"guesses\" more accurately what part of the scene to focus on.If you're just getting into photography, or want to move up from a point&shoot-; you will LOVE this.More interesting info-bits:It also has HD video and stereo sound.before I bought this, I didn't know about the \"PenPal\" accessory Olympus makes for this, which attaches to the camera for direct mobile uploadsALSO, when this is hooked up to your TV, most TV remotes can be used to control the camera as well as the TV!", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great value, but slightly crippled user experience", "Author": "David Tenser", "ReviewID": "R2DG9BWWSJSV11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my E-PM1 as an \"upgrade\" from my 2-year old Olympus E-P1, which of course is a more high end camera in some respects, but was simply getting a bit old and felt slow to me. I put \"upgrade\" in quotation marks because the E-PM1 isn't really meant as an upgrade from the E-P1 because the two cameras target separate customer audiences. But -- and I hope my review will be able to demonstrate this -- it certainly is possible to take this upgrade path if you've used the E-P1, as long as you're aware of what you're gaining and losing during the upgrade.Because of this, I'll focus this review on the differences (good and bad) between the old E-P1 and this new E-PM1:E-PM1 advantages:* Much faster focus algorithms - even with the same lenses, the PM1 focuses noticeably faster. With the new lenses, it's faster than any non-dSLR camera I've ever used.* Extremely lightweight and small - I think I managed to shave off another 100 grams of total weight in my camera bag with this upgrade!* Much improved kit zoom in terms of size and focus speed/noise. Although the lens mount is in plastic, it doesn't seem like there will be any problems with worn out mount connections.* Slightly, slightly better high ISO performance, though this is only confirmed by reading professional reviews.* Up to 5 fps burst mode - really impressive.* Nicer menu interface (though menu layout is mostly unchanged).* Comes with a useful snap-on flash that I've really missed on the E-P1 at e.g. very dim party nights. Now I just have to remember to bring it along with the camera. :)E-PM1 disadvantages:* I definitely preferred the retro design of the E-P1, but I was happy to give it up in favor of a much more portable package.* There is absolutely no grip on the E-PM1, making it a bit hard to hold. You can essentially forget about holding the camera with just one hand.* For some reason, Olympus leaves out a basic orientation sensor in their simpler models, which means that if you take photos in portrait mode, you have to manually rotate the photos on your computer. Not a big deal, but I can't understand why they would take out such a basic feature -- there's not a single mobile camera phone out there that doesn't include it, so it can hardly be a size (or cost) issue.* I really miss at least *one* more programmable Fn button, or at least the freedom to assign *any* feature to the one that exists (the Rec button). For some reason, Olympus decided to omit certain essential features that you can assign, which means that some combinations of direct button access aren't possible.* The video mode is crippled in the sense that it's no longer possible to re-focus while recording by e.g half pressing the shutter (or assigning the AEL/AFL lock button to focus). It's possible to program the AEL/AFL function (which can be assigned to the Rec button) to re-focus while in Manual mode when taking photos, but for some reason Olympus forgot to inherit that feature when switching to video mode. So, the only way to re-focus while recording a video is to give the control over entirely to the camera's hunting focus algorithms by switching over to continuous focus. This is a shame, really, and it makes the video feature much less useful to me.* The screen, while higher resolution than on the E-P1, actually ends up being a disappointing experience because of its aspect ratio. This is a widescreen (16:9), while  the E-P1 had a lower resolution 4:3 screen. Because both screens are labeled as 3\" sized, the widescreen actually ends up being a lot smaller if you still shoot your photos using the sensor-native 4:3 aspect ratio. (This is the same thing that happened a decade ago when you compared an old 28\" TV with the, then, new 28\" widescreen TVs -- the latter ended up being a much smaller screen in most practical purposes.) If would be nice if Olympus gave you the option of only seeing 16:9 cropped version of the view when framing a photo, while still actually recording the full frame (this is admittedly possible if you shoot in RAW, which I never do).Overall, by selling my old E-P1 and buying the new E-PM1, I ended up spending an additional ~220 USD, which, all in all, feels like a pretty cheap upgrade. The E-PM1 is better than the old E-P1 in many important respects (to me) such as overall size/weight, autofocus speed, and flash -- but it's admittedly a step back in some others. As an interim upgrade until the \"next big thing\" comes out, it feels like a good choice to me in the end. But if you own an E-P1/E-P2 and plan to hold on to your next camera upgrade for a long time, I would suggest you wait until sometime like a future E-P4 is announced, which may be a far more significant upgrade with (supposedly) a much improved sensor.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, LCD Vulnerable, Needed Extras Costly, semi-compatible with FL-600R flash", "Author": "Radical Shadow", "ReviewID": "R16RW1Y0TF1GY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've taken a few dozen pictures so far, and I see that I bought what I wanted - a point-and-shoot camera that allows the use of different lenses. I even bought an adapter ring to use the lenses from my 1985 Pentax Program Plus 35mm slr (manual focus, but that's what they were back then). The camera allows greater and greater manual control as desired. The pictures are rich and vivid. I also bought the 45mm f1.8 lens for portraits.When I am using the E-PM1, I find that the only place for my thumb is right on the lcd screen. There is a screen protector film that's made specifically for this camera, but you'll need to buy 10 or 20 of them so you can keep replacing them as they rub loose, especially around the buttons. The camera is small enough that even holding it by the lens is tricky. I bought a flash bracket to give my left hand a way to hold the camera.The little flash that comes with the camera does well for close shots (5-10 feet), but the reviews point out that, as with any camera, a much stronger flash is needed for long telephoto shots. Usually, a flash is put on the camera's hot shoe, but here lies a mystery. The little flash has a plastic foot that slides into the hot shoe, but it has no connections at all through the hot shoe, but rather is powered and controlled by an \"accessory port\" behind the hot shoe. Luckily there are also contacts on the hot shoe to control a dedicated flash. What does this \"accessory port\" offer that the hot shoe doesn't? The owner's manual doesn't mention anything about it other than a bluetooth-style file sharing gadget that plugs in there. Has Olympus released the power and signal patterns of this \"accessory port\" so that other companies can offer compatible products?Olympus would like people to buy one of their name-brand strong flashes (FL-50R, FL36R, etc.) that work with the camera's so-called RC signal. Reviews say that this is not \"radio control\", but a special-signal-light-trigger (supposedly avoiding the slave-flash vulnerability of popping whenever anyone else's flash goes off). The second flash has to be able to \"see\" the little flash mounted on the E-PM1. That puts the second flash forward of the camera, possibly in the field of view. Why put such a restriction on a second flash?I bought a 4-channel radio-control kit to control the newest FL-600R mega-flash. This solution lets the flash sit anywhere in the room, on a tripod, or on a bracket with the camera. Another option is to buy a hot-shoe extension cable, to control the mega-flash, which would be mounted on the bracket with the camera.Altogether, it's the age-old trick:  make an excellent product, but don't include things that would make it complete, then charge double the price for these necessary accessories. It's not unusual - alot of companies do this. And pretty soon other companies will begin making equivalent accessories that are priced way less than the name brand (I'm writing this in August 2012.) You'll be pleased with this camera - just make sure you make a list of what you want so you know the total cost when you decide to buy it.Four months later (Demeber 2012), I'm concerned about the LCD panel on the back of the camera. It is not recessed - there is no frame around it that might hold it up off a tabletop if the camera were laid on its back. It is so prominent that a screen protector is essential, crucial, vital to the safety of the screen, yet the protector I used was also vulnerable and rubbed loose in a few weeks. Surely camera designers should think of such things - am I expecting too much? I'll support the screen protector industry as long as I have this camera.Five more months later (May 2013), I have learned from Olympus Technical Support that the E-PM1 is not able to ask the FL-600R flash to light up its LCD light to augment the camera's little orange auto-focus lamp. The FL-600R flash has to have its LCD light turned on manually, but that leaves it on durinig the shot, which can confuse the auto-exposure on the camera.  Luckily, the newer E-PM2 does make use of the FL-600R LCD light for auto-focus. The E-PM2 has a slightly recessed screen, touch-screen capability (including touch-focus change during movie recording!) and other features not available on the E-PM1. Reader be aware!Other than the vulnerable LCD, the camera is great, but they've now made one better. That's why the price is half what it was. It's last year's model, and the company has moved on.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool shooting in a small package", "Author": "single malt", "ReviewID": "R233WO25K1ZXUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really enjoying this camera. The auto focus and shutter response are very fast, color is excellent, and with a little tweaking and getting used to the sparse buttons and wheels, most of the settings you'll use a lot are within quick reach.Its small size is a giant asset, making it very easy to take with you anywhere. To compliment this, it only takes about two seconds from cold/off to be on and ready to shoot. I have larger than average hands (without a lens I can almost hide the body itself in my hand), and while I wish there was some sort of snap-on grip out there, I don't feel klutzy shooting with it.The one downside is performance in low light, especially at the higher ISOs -- anything over 1000 and you can pretty much expect some noise. Also, the auto focus speed suffers dramatically, even when it fires a red LED as a sort of flashlight to find something to focus on.I haven't had occasion to play with the detachable flash much as of yet, but at first blush it works about like any point-and-shoot flash. I know you can adjust it via the camera's setup menus but I haven't toyed with that yet.I've taken a couple short videos at 1080p and it performs alright, although that feels more like an afterthought. There aren't many options there and the little built-in mic is better than a cell phone and not as good as a low-end camcorder, particularly if there is any wind or background noise.All in all, it's great for a small camera to carry with you and take great stills under most circumstances. The 4/3 form factor is gaining popularity and there are a LOT of lenses and accessories for this camera, so for the price, you might be able to do better but I can't see how. If I could, I would probably rate it 4.5 stars for the low light performance and vanilla video shooting, but the value overall is so high I can easily rounding it up.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic GF3 might be better for those upgrading from point-and-shoot", "Author": "SmartShopper \"SmartShopper\"", "ReviewID": "R1O9RXE2ISG6NY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The E-PM1 is compact for its class and takes good shots, but my wife spotted a deal on the GF3 (which I hadn't researched that much)--I'm glad she did cuz I'm happier with the GF3.  In comparison,the E-PM1 had some disadvantages:-Stabilization seems to create lots of audio noise when recording video--in this respect, in-body stabilization appears to be a disadvantage compared to Panasonic's in-lens approach.-Menus were OK though not intuitive to me (I guess few cameras are).  GF3's touchcreen makes some things a lot easier, especially since these entry-level cameras have lost some dials and buttons in favor of simplicity and size.-Kit zoom lens has a lock that prevents it from closing, but doesn't prevent accidental opening. After using the GF3 I prefer no lock at all.-Strap rings kind of jingle when you handle the camera.  GF3 loops are fixed.-Separate flash unit is a bit of a pain. GF3 has a popup flash instead of a hotshoe--shutterbugs will say it's blasphemy that I prefer that, but I'm just a father trying to take decent pics of my kids...  Credit goes to Olympus though that the flash seems to adjust power for the right exposure.  GF3 seems to fire full power all the time, though you can tilt it up for nice bounce-flash lighting indoors.-Battery charger is a small brick with a power cord.  GF3 comes with a brick with pop-out prongs.  I prefer the portability of the latter.GF3 also comes with a lens hood, if you like that kind of stuff.Anyway, E-PM1 is a decent camera and it's a bit smaller than the GF3 (the zoom kit lens is smaller; the body is about the same size).  Just letting you know that, for people like me--a point-and-shoot upgrader with no plans of becoming an enthusiast--the GF3 is worth a serious look.

So I'll just give my general experience with the camera instead of breaking down every single aspect of it.I was insantly in 'lust' with the E-p1 when I first saw it and kinda made up my mind that that was the camera I wanted to upgrade to. I was a p&s; camera user for 4 years and was finally able to save up and go for the upgrade. By that time, the E-p3, E-pl3, E-pm1 had just come out and I started my research into m43 to try and find the best value/potential camera. I got the E-pm1 because of the price. I paid $449 with a bundle kit that came with a case, 32gb mem card , UV filter, etc. All the basics. But the reasons I got this camera over say the Panny gf2/3 or PEN Ep2 etc. were:> Price, price, price - Same specs & hardware as the E-p3 and E-pl3, but $300-$400 less, hmmm.> Image quality seemed to get higher praises from reviews than the Panasonic m43 cameras. I also liked that Olympus was considered to be the best when it came to color.> Video - 1080i, which now I don't use because of the larger file size and what I consider lower quality.> The look - I saw a picture of the silver Epm1 with a leather cover that made it look less like a digital camera and more like the old film bodies. I fell in love at this point.[...]So I've had my Epm1 for long enough to say that for my purposes [which is mostly outdoor/landscape shooting] this camera is perfect as it's tiny size doesn't weigh me down. I like to take nature walks and take photos while I'm out, and not having to lug a big camera down the path is nice. I have a couple old MF lenses I've bought adapters for and both of them weigh more than the camera. So that's nice.Reading reviews, I saw a lot of people recommending a grip from a third-party. I got the flipbac G2 which looks nice especially with the leather skin from Aki-Asahi.I very rarely have a complaint about this camera, usually \"it'd be nice to have another button or two\". I don't miss the mode dial on top. The lack of built-in flash is kind of annoying, but I bought the 160 LED video light as a cheap way to get around using a flash. The grip issue was easy to resolve. Those are a few minor issues that never really bothered me because I was prepared for it.In conclusion: I don't think I could've been any happier with this camera. It was what I expected and more.PS - I've uploaded a couple of SOOC pictures taken with a MF Yashica via Fotodiox adapter.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "E-PM1: Fantastic for the price! Beautiful, small, super-fast, sturdy, sharp, light and cheap micro 4/3 camera", "Author": "Patrick JG", "ReviewID": "R7O0RDAHHD6YN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using Super Zoom Panasonic cameras with Leica lenses for years (DMC-ZS3 and DMC-ZS7 models). Lenses on my Panasonic cameras were fixed Leica 10x and 12x. I always wanted to try a camera with interchangeable lenses, but they were too big and heavy for me to be able to carry them with me everywhere. Then Micro 3/4 came and at thanksgiving, I started to look into the Sony NEX (more expensive), Panasonic GF and Olympus Pen models. Sony NEX line is said to have higher low light capabilities because of the bigger sensor, but I decided to go with the Olympus E-PM1 because it had a wider selection of lenses and the camera is just smaller and nicer with the 14-42mm lens than the Sony. Also I never liked the fact that when you buy SONY, every accessory pretty much has to be a Sony accessory like the lens right now. So I order my new Olympus and received my E-PM1 (bought at Best Buy) 2 weeks ago. I did the firmware update that went flawlessly on a MacBook Pro. Let me tell you what I think about my new E-PM1. It's a very nice little and light camera. I chose the silver color because it looked nice with the silver lens. At first you have to get use to the menu and get familiar with terms used in the menu. It's very extensive and probably not the best layout possible. But I got used to it after a good week of tweaking. BTW I'm not a photographer.  I would qualify myself as a photo enthusiast or amateur. I like taking photos and see the results. I try to understand how to better set parameters to take the best photos I can. Ok, so the menu requires some getting used to. The camera starts up very fast between 1 and 2s. But you need to extent the 14-42mm lens (by unlocking it) to be able to take the first shot. The Scene modes work well. The Art mode too, although It's not something I will use. I used the camera so far in JPEG mode only (I have not try RAW yet). iAuto mode, it could be hit or miss, especially indoor for shots with no flash under incandescent light. In iAuto the WB does not go to the incandescent setting, so photos come out yellowish. Aperture mode works very well for portraits. The AF is \"super fast\" and that's a small word to define the speed of focus. The original 14-42mm lens is pretty sharp at both ends, but at wide angle shows a lot more barrel distortion than my Leica fixed lens on my Panasonic ZS7 that was able to go wider. I bought an ACMAXX 3.0\" HARD LCD ARMOR PROTECTOR for Olympus E-PM1. The LCD gets scratched easily. The protector is great but it sits very close to the menu and wheel buttons. The screen resolution is decent although it has a widescreen ratio (16/9) and I use (4/3). There is an issue when you try to put up on screen the grid used for the rule of thirds. The proportions are not good either in 16/9 or 3/2. I reported this issue to Olympus. To tell you the truth, I don't miss a viewfinder, but a tilting LCD would be great. I have not tested the flash yet. I took all indoors photos in low light with no flash. The lens is very good for that if subjects don't move too much. I have not found a nice small case for it yet. I tried one from a kit that Cameta was selling (same leather case that Olympus sells), but I did not like it. It's a bag that is too small and does not close properly as there are openings that can be closed. I just returned the kit today because the battery that came in it is not for an E-PM1 even though Cameta says the kit is for an E-PM1. I think it's a scam. I called them and obviously they knew the battery would not work for me, so I told them to remove the E-PM1 reference from their website, but they did not want to hear that. Back to the E-PM1, the software that comes for Mac OS X works well but Macs don't get the HD version of the other applications (that's bad!). I called customer service at Olympus a few times, and there was always somebody in America (very rare these days) to answer the call and answer my questions as opposed to read a script to me. The E-PM1 battery (BLS1) lasts about 300 shots which is standard. I ordered for $30, 2 more batteries + charger + car charger (Wasabi Power Battery Charger for Olympus PEN E-PM1). I receive this week. The video mode in 1080 is decent. The stabilization system seems to work well. I use the camera with an Eye-Fi Mobile X2 8GB SD card Class 6. There is an icon that shows when the Eye-Fi card is transmitting data. It does not seem to affect the battery discharge too much. by the way Eye-Fi is great. It allows my photos to get downloaded via Wi-Fi from my camera to my computer and my website with no intervention. I don't need to connect any cable or remove the card from the camera. It's the first time I own an Olympus and so far so good. I like my E-PM1 that I bought $449. The image quality, color and sharpness are higher than what my Panasonic ZS7 is producing. Last week, I bought an Olympus Telephoto lens for the E-PM1 because the price dropped at Adorama from $299 to $149. I could not pass on it! I have not really used that lens enough to give an opinion, but so far it's good.

Farther more, the images I get are sharp with excellent color rendition.The M4/3 lenses are much smaller and lighter to curry around and a snap to pull out of the back and switch so I never miss a shot.

Don't be fooled with the size of the sensor, The images are sharp and superior to Sony's APC-S nex series If you can find a camera for sale without the kit lens, get it and use the difference towards a nice lens. I mostly use the Pana/Leica 45/f2.8 and the Oly 9-18 f4. I also have the 40-150 but I find that I don't use it that often.The E-pm1 w/Panasonic 45/2.8 is my favorite set to take everywhere and covers 95% of my needs. I ended getting both the black E-pm1 and the white bodies and returned the black one) The white body surprisingly feels much more tougher and sturdier and very very cool to have. I get a lot of compliments and interest with the white E-PM1 then I ever got from my black, 10x more expensive equipment.If you are upgrading from Olympus you'll have an easy time getting around the menu layout but for new comers to the M4/3 it will be a fun learning experience. Conclusion: This is a fun, professional grade unit. Between the Panasonic and Olympus there is a good lens selection. Great for every casual/daily photographic need and more.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meets expectations", "Author": "snowman", "ReviewID": "R3APWDT5U6FH2L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent little camera with big camera options.

I already have 2 APS dSLRs with lenses cover 8mm to 300mm with overlapping zooms and fixed FLs. I have always been fascinated by m43 but had no need for one. A recent trip left me wanting something smaller, a lot smaller. I had a Panasonic LX3 but the IQ was not good enough above base ISO.I came across a pre-owned Olympus E-PM1 at a fantastic price (cheaper than many P&S;). Bought it. Wow ... what an amazing little camera. It is really tiny even compared to APS dSLR, let alone FF dSLR. The kit lens is actually quite good; for sure good enough for my intended use. For more serious work, I am still using the dSLRs. The menu system does not bother me but does take some getting used to. The only thing that I found truly inferior is the image stabilization. My dSLRs also are equipped with in-body stabilization. Under identical condition, the dSLR can go at least one stop slower in shutter speed than the E-PM1. I think E-PM1 is so much lighter that makes it less stable. This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.****************************************************July 31 update:I am climbing the learning curve and now feel fairly confident that I have set the appropriate system parameters. Here are some of the first pictures [...]I began to explore using my existing lenses (w/ an adapter) with e-pm1. I must say the IQ is great. I tried a number of fixed FL (14/2.8, 28/2.8, 50/1.4, 85/1.4) and zoom (100-300/4) and in conjunction with a 1.4X TC. I have very little reservation as far as IQ is concerned. Without the electronic communication, it is like going back to the days before automatic aperture. Doable but definitely inconvenient. This was done to gauge what this camera is capable of when coupled with top optics. I will be using the two kit zooms combo as my primary walk around camera.Couple things that I wish for 1) ISO lower than 200, 2) placing photos in folders based on date, 3) turn off stabilization automatically when self timer is activated.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera", "Author": "J.

Firstly, this camera is solid and well built and is a definite step-up in image quality compared to compact cameras. I used to think that my Sony wx150 took awesome photos, but the quality of images from this camera is much better. The auto-focusing on this camera is very quick and accurate; I even find that the auto focusing of this camera is even good at night as it uses an assist lamp to help focus. I take a lot of indoor pictures in the house which could be considered low-light. For those type of pictures, I always use the flash and adjust the settings up a level.The results of the pictures taken with flash are absolutely top-notch. Another good thing is that you can actually set the sync speed for the flash and shutter to always fire at 1/160(its maximum for flash); I find that this always does a good job of freezing the action and you don't have to worry about the shutter speed adjusting because of the iso.I would highly recommend this camera for parents who just want a better camera. When I first bought the camera, I would always use auto mode, but I started to get interested in using some of the other features. I took about an hour to search online and learn about aperture, iso, and shutter speed, and have since been using aperture with iso set to auto. If I'm taking pictures outside in the sun, I will usually adjust the iso to 200 or 300, but if I'm taking photos inside, the flash will usually always default to an iso of 200. With that being said, I would highly recommend just taking a little time to learn about those three aspects of the camera, and once you have a basic understanding, it will really motivate you to use the other modes. Another great thing about the camera is the number of settings you can customize. I didn't know to much about customization when I first bought the camera, but I did research and found out that you can actually open the \"super menu\" on this camera that really allows you to change so many different aspects.The only negative that I can find about this camera so far is the video recording feature. The actual recording footage that this camera produces is excellent, but there are two things that ruin it for me. First, the image stabilization does not work good for video. I have tried recording with both ibis on and off, and although the stabilization is better with it off, its still not something I want to use. The second video feature that is probably the most annoying is the noise that the lens makes when auto-focusing during movies. Although the auto-focusing is very quick, the noise it makes is very loud and audible during movies. It sort of sounds like a \"wood pecker\" and its pretty annoying. I was going to send the lens to Olympus, but I decided to do a search for this problem before contacting them. After doing some research, I found that other people have the same noise, so I'm guessing its just normal. The lens that came with my kit was the II R lens, not the first version. Even though I know this camera is mostly for photos, it would have easily been the best all around camera if the stabilization and auto-focus noise were corrected, but hey, I purchased my brand new camera and kit for only $160 on craigslist, so I'm really not expecting the video to be professional, I just wanted to let potential buyers know my opinion on how the video works in case they were thinking of buying the camera strictly for video.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera. If you can buy a brand new bundle with the lens for less than $200, I say go for it without hesitation. But if the price is more expensive than that, I would highly recommend that you take a look at the E-PM2. You can get the newer version for $299 with the kit lens, and from what I've heard, the sensor on the E-PM2 is much better, and the noise from low light photos is much less. If I didn't own this camera and I was looking to get a good compact, I would choose the E-PM2 as it is marginally less than what these new E-PM1's are going for on here, but either way, you are getting a great camera.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Takes pictures", "Author": "Sean R.", "ReviewID": "R3ISSDTWASFYXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

Today (Friday) was the first day I took it on location to my son's school and shot a bunch of pictures with it, both indoors and outdoors.My general conclusion is that this is a nice little camera, takes good pics even without messing around too much with the settings. If you really want to fine-tune your pictures then you'll need to invest a bit of time to tweak the settings just the way you want it to get the result you are looking for. In my case, I've been trying to get a shallower depth of field in many of my pics but I gave up a lot on capturing the moment (I'd be too busy messing around with the on screen menu and miss the key moment worth capturing).I think it's about getting used to the camera and how it behaves. I have to unlearn my habits of using my old Nikon workhorse of a D70 and adjust myself to this cam. The form factor is wonderful, very compact. More specific info to come, but right now I'm generally very pleased with it since I now have a very very portable camera that I know I will be using more to capture important moments.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "small for casual shooting only", "Author": "Trevor Wong", "ReviewID": "RLEH30M79NAH8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pro:Small sizeGood quality picture & videoCon:Shutter is heavily vibratednot quick access to manual(no dial at all)Quality issue, my shutter for P, A , S and M jammed in 6 months.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I will return mine.", "Author": "EPM1 problem", "ReviewID": "R1Z6D5XCW9IDHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchase mine at the store. 1 thing that i notice is that when you are taking a shot you will accidentaly press the video mode.

The software downloading of pictures is not a one step process as with Cannon or Nike, you have to go through 4 steps to download images and then you have to make sure they are in your picture file before you delete the camera pictures--which you have to do one at a time.  Not easy to use and picture quality is very poor in the auto modr, have not tried the manual but I should not have to do that.  When you plug the camera into the computer it should automatically start the programe to download and you should just have to select OK, not so with this software--even with the latest upgrades.  Buy a Cannon , they are easier to use and take way better picture.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning:  Does Not Work in Very Cold Weather", "Author": "Kusko", "ReviewID": "R1LQAR6FK7JZNM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really liked this camera -- until the shutter froze. Twice. From what I can tell, it's junk in VERY cold weather.I shoot in cold weather a lot and I used this camera on an extended trip through Canada. I took the E-PM1 outside often in temperatures between 20 above and 20 below zero Fahrenheit. Other cameras that I own or have owned, (Canon 5D Mark II, G9, S90, and Panasonic GF1) have not had a problem in cold temperatures, even doing long exposure shots at 40 below zero. Sure, their battery capacity sucks when its that cold, but the cameras otherwise functions perfectly. Not the E-PM1.When shooting in cold weather, the shutter locked down. I had to mail it into Olympus. Four weeks later I received it back with a brand new shutter. But a week later the shutter froze AGAIN.One bad shutter is a lemon. But two bad shutters means this camera has a problem. Not only does it not work in freezing temperatures, but it becomes a brick that sure better be under warranty.So if you live north of Portland, OR, be warned. This thing may crap out on you when outside in winter.
