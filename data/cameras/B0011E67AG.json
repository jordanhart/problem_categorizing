The photos are beautiful, with great definition and colors. It's not as slow as Sony cameras are heard to be considered, even when it's not light-fast.the only problems I see on it is that the LCD display, even when it's big and have good resolution, has a problem showing the real colors and brightness of the image, you it will take you a good time to learn how your real picture will look based on the one on the LCD. I have been taking pictures with all of the options of the camera and I still couldn't learn which one to choose. the other problem is that it's really hard to focus on close objects, even faces or solid objects.But, for the money you pay for this camera, it's overall an excellent camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "So far, so good...", "Author": "Kathy D.

The economy being what it was, I decided that I didn't want to blow a HUGE wad o' cash--just enough to get a good quality camera that had higher megapixels than what I already had (a Casio QV-R40 with 4.0 megapixels).A Flickr friend had just bought herself a Sony Cybershot and liked it a lot, so I set about doing some research.  As it turned out, Amazon.com had this particular Cybershot model on sale at the time I was looking, so I got a great deal as well as a great camera.The Sony Cybershot S750 features 7.2 megapixels, a 2.5\" LCD monitor, ISO 1250 (high sensitivity) and a 3X optical zoom.  In hindsight, I wish I had gone up a notch to a higher zoom but, all in all, I have been very happy with the camera.  It was tremendously easy to learn to use.  I am not a big fan of \"reading the blanking manual,\" so having something that is easy to use right out of the box was a bonus.It has a very quick & easy wheel that allows you to switch between different types of shots quickly.  The options are the standard auto adjustment setting for photos, a program auto setting (which I haven't tried yet), a movie setting, a snow setting for taking pictures in a bright white landscape, a waterside setting for beach and other water shots, a twilight setting for shooting in low light w/o flash, a twilight portait setting, a landscape setting, a soft background setting and a blur-reducing low-light setting.The battery supposedly would allow you to take about 280 shots on one battery charge, which is pretty darned great compared to my older camera.  However, it won't take much without an additional memory card (for an additional cost, of course).  I got the Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo with 8gb of memory and that has worked very well.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hector J", "Author": "Hector J \"Hector\"", "ReviewID": "R1KOJ8DNEYRZUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item is a great purchase , it gives you some option to get pictures in any whether as well as videos from all that you want and love.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point & Click Camera For The Average Family", "Author": "J.

I had had the W5 for 3 years with no problems. This camera however, developed a very nuisance problem after only 9 months. In some exposures, mostly in pics that had large expanses of bright blue sky, but not exclusively, large dark spots would mar the picture. In one pic the spots would be there, and in the next, in a slightly different exposure they wouldn't be. As it was still under warranty, I took it in for repair.  I got it back with a note saying that it had been a problem with the optics and it was fixed. Two months later similar spots were back. I didn't have the time to take it in for repairs and be without a camera for several weeks at that time, so I lived with the spots for a few months, doing a workaround of not putting so much sky in the pics (I lived in gorgeous big sky country so I liked to take landscapes with lots of sky pics). I finally took it in for repairs again (thankfully I had purchased the extended warranty my retailer was offering)and when it came back (with a note saying they had replaced the \"switchboard\"), it was free of the spots for probably less than a month. I am hoping that when I take it in this time that they will just call it a lemon and replace the stupid thing.  The other annoying thing about this camera is its lack of ability to get colors on the blue end of the spectrum correct.  When I've tried to take pictures of dark purple iris flowers and other dark purple flowers, the flowers always come out very blue. Then for at least the last several months, nearly every picture has too much blue in it, so I'm glad my basic photo software has color correction as a Fix. I have to use it on every picture to take the blue cast out. In addition, recently the auto lens cover has been sticking halfway shut. On the plus side, the camera has only very minor trouble with auto focus, does a lovely macro shot, and can handle a very bright snowy day or a dark interior room exposure pretty well.  So while I was initally satisfied with the camera, it went downhill at 9 months and has just gotten worse with the blue color cast and the sticking lens cover at less than 2 years. I find that unacceptable.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good little \"back-up\" camera", "Author": "M. Blackwell", "ReviewID": "R1RFSDJ5BNOUY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not long ago, my trusty \"old faithful\" Canon stopped working and I began to shop around for a new camera.  The newer models don't have some of the nice features that \"old faithful\" had, and so I was frustrated...  could I do without a viewfinder?  Besides, I knew the controls of \"old faithful\", and didn't want to have to go through the learning curve again.  Then, miraculously, I learned that the issue my camera was experiencing was covered by Canon - for free - even though it was long out of warranty.  So, I sent it off, and was told promptly that it was indeed going to be fixed.Sorry...  that's a long lead-up to my view on this Sony.  I had a couple of events that I didn't want to attend without a camera, and so when I spotted this Sony on sale recently, I snapped it up as a \"back-up\" camera, to use while my other camera was being repaired, and to have for those occasions when I really didn't want a larger camera, or when there was any chance the camera might be at risk (bike riding, for example).  I got the camera home (with the 2G card I had purchased), and was delighted to see that the controls were very similar to those on the Canon.  The learning curve was very short.  I love the large LCD screen (good thing, since there is no viewfinder), and although there aren't as many shooting modes as I have had on the Canon, these are certainly sufficient for a casual photo shooter!  Even better...  when you set a mode, the LCD shows you the selection you have made (nice for those whose eyesight isn't what it used to be).  And there are some new features that \"old faithful\" didn't have...  stabilization, face recognition, etc.  I found the close-up feature to be more difficult that \"old faithful\" because it had a shorter range of focus, and was more sensitive to movement (which, in a tiny camera, is always an issue).  I noticed the problems others have commented on regarding flash-outs, white, colors, etc., and after playing with the camera I can say that these problems can be overcome - you just have to know your camera better.So...  long story short is that I think this is an excellent little camera for a \"back-up\"!!  In fact, there may be times I'll reach for this instead of \"old faithful\" (which has been returned to me in perfect condition!!).  If you're a first-time digital camera user, this is a good choice...  you'll learn lots as you use it and review the manual periodically.  It's at a price-point that makes it a great gift for graduates or special birthdays or other celebrations, and it fits in your pocket...  easily.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-S750 7.2MP", "Author": "Ronald S.
