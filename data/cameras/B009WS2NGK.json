{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One fine do-it-all camera", "Author": "Dustin C Beach", "ReviewID": "RM93MR8W62UAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm the previous owner of a Canon Rebel XSi DSLR and a Canon SX20. I loved my Rebel, which I bought to take Photography and Graphic Design classes in college. After owning it for two years (and investing $1500 into it, lenses, and other equipment), it was stolen. Not wanting or able to afford investing into another DSLR, I stuck with the Canon brand and bought an SX20 \"superzoom\" camera. It worked well, but I ended up using it mostly for video work for my church. Then I let a \"friend\" borrow it for school and never saw him or the camera again. Notice a pattern here? Now that I'm doing freelance work, photos/video for my church, and wanting to keep up with doing amateur nature photography, I went camera shopping once again.I've always been a fan of Canon, but I'm also a fan of having the best you can afford, and brand loyalty only goes so far. One of my major gripes with the SX20 was it's crappy low-light abilites. And even though Canon's new SX50 is cheaper than the FZ200 and has a 50X lens, it has a maximum aperature of 3.4 (that goes to 6.5 zoomed all the way in) - not good for low light and for a lens that long. I'd had friends recommend cameras from Sony and Panasonic, and after some research, came across the FZ200. I liked the basic specs - 12.1MP, 24X zoom, full manual controls - plus it shoots RAW, has a hotshoe, a microphone jack and 1080p video (remember, I shoot movies too), and - this sealed the deal for me - an aperture of f2.8 through the entire zoom range.After having it for a few months and taking trips to parks, DC, and a few zoos, here's what I love about it:Everything.There's nothing this camera can't do. Want usable pictures and video in stupid low light? It'll do it. Like to edit RAW? It'll do it. Fully manual controls with a second rocker switch on the side of the lens barrel that will allow you to manually focus and zoom seperately? It's got that. In-camera Sweep Panoramas and HDR images that actually work? Yup. Great battery life, always good images (you can often just leave it in Program mode and get images as good as or better than those that you tinkered with in Manual mode), gorgeous video, not too heavy, no need to lug around extra lenses and stuff.The ONLY issues I have with this camera is that if you have a tripod shoe on it, you can't get to the battery or SD card without removing it. It's a little plasticky if you're used to an SLR. And sometimes highlights get blown out if you're not careful with your exposure. And, well, it's still not quite as good as a DSLR. The price puts it right up against entry-level DSLRs, but you won't get the zoom range (and convenience of a single do-it-all lens) and it works better as a casual video camera - most DSLRs require special lenses if you want autofocus.If you want a really really nice camera that does everything and want to do hobby photography/video without investing in a DSLR system, you really can't go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a few flaws.", "Author": "Eugene Beckes", "ReviewID": "RFF0T1EVHX7DZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very capable gem of a camera, and if you're persistent and patient, you'll be able to get some truly terrific images with it. I photograph birds 99% of the time, quite a demanding discipline. In good light, the FZ200 is wonderful. (Though even then, the auto focus could be better.) In lower light, the AF is slow or painfully and practically non-existant for a subject that is usually moving around a lot. For non-moving subjects, you'd fare better.I have other complaints; for example, the four-way controller is far too easily influenced by my hand when I don't want it to be, as in when I'm simply using the grip to try to take a photo. It's very easy to accidentally influence the \"WB\" (white balance) when gripping the camera. I've learned to grip the camera in a rather uncomfortable way so as not to turn on the WB, but it should be designed so this is not a problem.As said, it's not a perfect instrument, but for the price and abilities of the camera, I feel it's quite a bargain. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. (One more item: If you're used to using a DSLR with a big lens, (I also own and use a Nikon D7000 and have a Sigma 150-500mm lens on it,) you'll love the convenience, weight, and size of the Panasonic FZ200. I often use it without a tripod and the image stabilization works very well. (And using it minus the tripod allows far more mobility, meaning you'll get shots you can't get with a tripod.)

I prefer to shoot JPG (tho this'll do RAW) and like to use Photoshop CS6 to enhance every image I post.  FZ200 images are a joy to edit requiring less work than those from either GH2 or GH3.I shoot mostly at the max telephoto end of the zoom with subjects being birds and wildlife or boaters out on the lake.

I also own the Lumix LX7 compact, Nikon 12x super zoom Coolpix P100 & P510 (50x), Nikon DSLR D70, D7000 & D600.  I have been using film cameras since I was 12 and owned some nostalgic cameras from Nikon, like the Nikkormats and the F series cameras.  This Lumix FZ200 is way ahead of it's competition mainly because  of it's Leica designed constant aperture zoom lens. I was also impressed with the algorythm used on it's iA setting. The only thing I wish they incorporated on this compact was a 4/3 sensor.  However, I understand that the lens design using a fixed aperture lens on a 4/3 sensor may be cost prohibitive. Hello, Panasonic or Leica: I would like to see a 4/3 sensor camera with a fixed 25x zoom with f/2.0 constant aperture camera for about $1500 in the near future.  I hope I don't have to wait too long. For now, the FZ200 beats all of them (compact super zooms) in performance including the Sony 50x HX300, especially at dusk. This Lumix is a great deal for $499.

I recently pulled trigger when the price was at $450.  I am rating this camera five stars for what the camera is, not what it isn't.  What do I mean?  This camera has a certain purpose and it is not to take a nature photo for the cover of National Geographic.  It is excellent for being easy to use, amazing zoom, and taking great pictures at the end of the zoom.I bought this camera for birding.  I have seen many other birders with this camera and talked with them as well before making the purchase.  In my own experience in the field, I have been more than pleased with the purchase.  Things I can hardly see with my naked eye, like a snowy owl this past weekend, I can zoom in 48x (up to 24x, but will go to 48x digitally) and make out what kind of bird is in the distance.  You would need a scope otherwise.  Other people with DLSR cameras and huge lenses next to me are getting less zoom.  It is very easy to use and carry.  This was very important to me because I often hike long distance to find birds.  This would not be fun with a huge lens and tripod.I have seen nature photographers with $20,000 cameras and lenses.  Those cameras will take better photos then this camera.  This fact does not mean this camera takes poor photos.  I have taken excellent photos indoors and outside.  The record function for the video is easy to use.  I have operated this camera with mittens on (there is a zoom control that is easy to use on the left side of the lens.I have put some photos on Flickr mostly to document what birds I saw on Ebird.  I did not use Photoshop.  Some of the photos may seem a little blurry.  Those were taken at very far distances - in some cases I could barely see a brown bump which turned out to be an eagle.

I agree with other reviewers that there can be noise, but I have loved using it. It is my 4th Panasonic, previously I have owned the FZ18, FZ28 and FZ150. All have produced stunning photographs. I have considered a DSLR, but suspect that the weight and cost of lenses would be detrimental to my photography, I love having wide angle to super zoom at my fingertips, my photography can just flow.Two days ago I was in the middle of a wonderful shoot while on vacation in England. I always return the camera to a case between shots in case I trip and fall. Turning it on to take a new shot, I realized to my horror that it would not zoom, the lever is jammed. The focus does not appear to be working, I cannot review images in the camera or change any settings in any mode. I can take a wide angle photo, but that is it. I contacted Panasonic immediately and they instructed me access Menu in P mode and Reset. But I cannot access the menu!!!!!!! Last year my FZ150 was in for repair twice, taking 4-6 weeks each time. The last time there was actually no hope in sight of my camera every being returned, so Panasonic replaced it with the FZ200. I was delighted and finally happy with Panasonic again. The replacement was refurbished and and only came with a 90 day warranty, which expired 2 weeks ago. And I am in England with no camera.

Hence the compact cameras starting in late 90s, moving onto smartphones(all iphones), shaking head at those with those massive DSLRs and telephoto lenses hanging from their necks and shoulders.Over the years though, there has been a nagging feeling which intensified after a recent trip to Utah where we found the picture quality from phones and compacts woefully inadequate to capture the detail,color and sheer magnificence of what was in front of us. After all, pictures are the only way to preserve memories outside of your head(which is becoming more and more unreliable every day, I blame ADD).Long story short, we decided to join the throngs and the first decision was that a DSLR/mirrorless would not work because of1) the interchangeable lens situation - going from a smartphone to lugging around huge body and 3 lenses was a step too far2) prohibitive costSo a bridge camera it was. Trawling through the interwebs, it became quite clear that there were not more than 2-3 choices in this category which would fit all requirements of size,photo quality, build quality and features. Of these, the only one that was acclaimed by professionals and amateurs alike on every website was the FZ200 . So we decided to take the leap, ably supported by a carrying case, a whopping 64 GB high speed SD card and Amazon's superb return policy purchased the camera just before a 2 month trip overseas.Initially the quality looked good, nothing better or worse than a good quality picture on your compact or smartphone. But as time went by, it became clear there was it was ALWAYS a good quality picture, irrespective of the lighting,subject etc. We are by no means photo gourmets, but I believe the best things about this camera is that it is raises the average quality of your photographs without any extra effort and hence makes itself indispensable. The zoom lens is spectacular in its detail and sharpness but the color content of a photo at the top end of the zoom does seem to suffer marginally. The battery life is simply amazing and it will go on for 2-2.5 days of regular shooting without needing a recharge. The size in your hands never seems too big or bulky as its oozes class and if there is any such thing as a good looking camera, this would be a supermodel!There is one problem though found by Mr.me which is that it sometimes hunts for focus when zooming in extremely close to some objects, which he is convinced will not be a problem in DSLR, but that's just splitting hairs.I don't have any comparative analysis, but don't need it as this camera has fulfilled its promise and more; even the weight of it hanging around your neck has miraculously lightened proving another adage \"you can get used to anything\".

Hudson", "ReviewID": "R38MCT6TGP94B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent nearly a year evaluating different cameras before buying this one. I've only had it a very short time, but so far I love it. Contrary to several people who told me the menu system is confusing, I find it fairly easy to navigate. But they may have been referring to the older FZ100 and FZ150. I've noticed the zoom is smoother and quieter than most of the other camera's I tested, including Sony, Fujifilm and Nikon superzooms. I liked the fact that it has a threaded lens barrel (52mm). So all it took to adapt my 55mm filters was an inexpensive 52 - 55mm step up ring. Probably the only filter you'll ever need is a circular polarizer. I also have a UV filter on mine, but only for the purpose of protecting the camera lens. The camera already deals very well with UV light. Don't waste your money on neutral density filters. The camera has plenty of adjustment without resorting to this type of filter.Hugediscountstore did a good job. The order was processed quickly and the camera arrived on time and in good condition. Packaging was adequate. (I think they could have used a few more Styrofoam peanuts, but as I said, it was adequate to arrive without damage to the Panasonic box even though the Post Office did some damage to the shipping box.I would recommend both the FZ200 and HugeDiscountStore to friends and would do business with HugeDiscountStore again.If you're not in a hurry for the camera, watch the prices. It has a tendency to go up and down in price. I bought mine for less than what you usually see them advertised for.Another tip; view Graham Houghton's FZ200 videos on You Tube. They are quite excellent and explain most of the more advanced features of the camera. There are also a couple of videos that explain the basics. MUCH better than Panasonic's manual.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Steep learning curve, inadequate documentation", "Author": "croyt", "ReviewID": "R3TTUK3NR5R3UX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Impressive machine, but I'm still working on mastering its complex, nonintuitive (compared to more standard DSLR) interface.

I'd been waiting a long while to upgrade from my old Canon Powershot Pro 1, purchased 10 years ago, and I'm glad I researched and waited. Thanks to that old Canon (which Canon never upgraded), I decided never to go the DSLR route, preferring the portability and functionality of a high end \"bridge\" type point-and-shoot. I am fairly dazzled by what the FZ200 has to offer: big telephoto at f2.8 (even bigger, tho a bit problematic, in IA mode), nice crisp macro (a single switch away), the big swing-out variable-angle screen, good movie quality, and lots of manual settings at my disposal. It has tons of \"Custom\" settings if you're into that, I'm not. It's small and light enough for hiking, works great under adverse conditions (I got some great shots of the recent \"blood moon\" eclipse) and it takes RAW images.A few negatives for balance: the extreme telephoto in IA mode takes \"hard\" pictures full of artifacts, so I only use it as a last resort; it's really hard to take a selfie without accidentally pushing buttons and resetting things like WB, so use your phone; the panorama \"scene\" mode takes pictures that have this visible \"curtaining\" effect of varying exposures, so I still do panos the old-fashioned way, with Photoshop. The full manual (a pdf - save a tree!) is rather poorly organized.But overall I love it. I'm still learning its capabilities and I'm impressed with the results.

I needed a 2nd camera that I could keep with me in the car and one that I could shoot one-handed since I lost the use of my left hand. I have a Nikon D series DSLR and a Lumix G series DSLM. The Nikon is heavy, big, and almost impossible to use with one hand. The Lumix G series is light, small and handles terrific but I wanted longer reach. The FZ200 gives me the extra reach and is mostly easy to use for my needs. My only gripes are the lack of an eye sensor to shift between the EVF /touchscreen without pushing a button and the small sensor size. It is time to build these cameras with a larger sensor than the size that is used in cheap point-and-shoot cameras. As for the lens, I could not be happier. The F2.8 lens lets me shoot at faster shutter speeds for nice sharp images of wildlife and birds in flight. It is simply fun to use. I only use this camera and my Lumix G series now.

This camera is simple to use, but it also comes with lots of great features that my FZ50 does not have.  The photos are clear and usually in focus (and when they aren't, it is often the operator's fault).  I am a nature photographer, as well as an event photographer.  I have taken photos of birds - sometimes at long distances - and I am amazed at the clarity this camera produces.  When moving into the extended zoom feature, the photos do become a little bit pixelated, but that is to be expected.  I am still reading the manual and learning tips and new features.  While on a recent trip to Florida I discovered the panoramic feature and I LOVE it!!  What used to take hours sitting at the computer stitching photos together is now done by this camera ... and so far I've had great luck with it.  I have nothing negative to say about this camera.  It would be great for the beginner or the seasoned veteran looking for a camera that is lightweight and easy to take along on hikes or wherever you don't want to lug a ton of equipment.  Oh...and I purchased a protective lens filter (clear) as the lens is very close to the end of the camera barrel and definitely needs the extra protection.
