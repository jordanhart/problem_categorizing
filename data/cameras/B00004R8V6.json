The resolution and features are truly incredible for a camera in this price range. The software installs easily and has good  help information to guide you through the image editing process.The  camera comes loaded with many nice features. About the only thing lacking  is an optical zoom. I'm a frugal consumer and decided that the added cost  of an optical zoom wasn't justified for my intended use of the camera. Most  features have been covered in other reviews but one nice feature that I  haven't seen mentioned much is the video out jack and cable (included) that  allows you to view your photos on a television. My parents are in their  80's and don't have excellent vision, so the television connector lets me  share photos with them without them having to peer at the tiny LCD  screen.Accessories add a substantial amount to the cost of your camera  outfit. Expect to pay an extra $100 to $250 above and beyond the camera  price for them. I bought a SanDisk SmartMedia 32MB memory card, a DigiPower  Solutions 12X rechargeable power pack, and a SanDisk SmartMedia USB  external drive for downloading onto my PC. The only problem I encountered  was with the Sandisk SmartMedia USB external drive. The install software  had trouble locating a device driver, but I was able to locate the correct  driver at the Sandisk web site and get things working properly. I have not  had any experience with Olympus support, since everything works  great.The bottom line is that this camera offers fantastic value for the  money you spend on it. You really can't go wrong buying this camera.

I spent some time comparing the features of different brands and  models in the $300 to $800 range.  Dollar for dollar this camerea is very  hard (impossible?) to beat.  What you get for twice the price isn't that  much more with the exception of a zoom.  Zooms are a mixed blessing anyway  because so often you get blurry pictures (because you don't use a tripod).  Plus, you usually give up some close-up ability when you have a zoom.  The  zoom might be more important if you don't have some photo editor software  to crop, enlarge, or otherwise manipulate your digital pictures.  Some  minor concerns.  I find the look and feel a little \"clunky\"  compared to other Olympus cameras and other brands.  Also, the new models  are less iMac friendly.  So, I bought an Olumpus SmartMedia Reader which  added to the cost but is a very cool device.  And battery life?  I read all  the comments about getting rechargeable batteries but I was still shocked  at how fast the batteries wear out.

It's also really small compared to  those clunkers.  It doesn't have a zoom, but night pictures and flash come  out  very well.  I've been very happy with it so far--used it as my only  camera on my trip to Hawaii with great results.  Be warned, it goes through  batteries quickly--we got some rechargeables that helped.", "Date": "March 15, 2000"}, {"Title": "For the price - its mindblowingly awesome !", "Author": "samir ahmad", "ReviewID": "R23W1Z7FHKSGX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been searching the digital camera market for months trying to figure out which camera to buy within usd 400 when i came across the Olympus-D360L. I had been reading the customer reviews for several days on  Amazon, and was very much prepared for the short battery life, only 30 good  quality photos with a 8 mb smartmedia card etc. BUT, was i surprised !  Not only does a set of 4 AA batteries (good quality, i.e. Duracell or Sony)  last for the entire 8 MB shoot, but it also allows for a full /  unrestricted use of the flash. To make matters even more impressive, you  can take as much as 122 pictures (standard setup) and the quality of these  photos is amazing. Only if you download these photos and zoom in 2-3 times  into the photo will you feel the 'mosaic', but for ordinary folks like you  and me, we dont need to zoom in that much, and standard photos itself is  extremely good. Furthermore, if you view the photos on TV the clarity is  even more amazing. One thing though ... viewing 'portrait' pictures on TV  is a strain on the neck and the camera does not have any builtin feature  which could switch 'portrait' pictures to 'landscape'.

Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.", "Date": "June 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "The best deal you'll find", "Author": "\"the_beholder\"", "ReviewID": "R1T089NAPG0HJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera does a lot of things for only 300 dead presidents.  It has thousands of options, great image quality, and, of course, it's digital!  Now you can take all those embarrassing photos of yourself without being afraid of the CVS guy laughing at you.If you lower the image quality you can take 122 pictures on the ultra-small disk provided.  However, the quality is really, really bad (640x480 highly-distorted JPEG).  But on good quality you can take 36, which is enough for one session (you can delete the images from the camera after you download them to your hard drive.)  There's a super-high quality option which makes TIFFs, but I never use it.A few drawbacks:the graphics-editing program that comes with the camera SUCKS.  If you plan to do major photo-editing you should get ahold of Paint Shop Pro (jasc.com) or Adobe Photoshop (adobe.com).  Another problem is that the batteries run out very fast.  It uses four AA batteries every time, which last me about two weeks.  If you want to save on battery life, try not to use the LCD screen and instead take pictures the \"normal\" way.  Also, try not to view the photos on the camera and instead download them to your computer first and view them from the hard drive.Despite these problems, it's the best deal you can find for so little money.

After getting to know it and adding some much needed accessories, I can say it really is a great camera, at a reasonable price. The quality of the pictures is astounding considering it is a relatively basic model. The first thing I would recommend ordering with it is a Sandisk reader. This is cheap and a must have; it downloads all your pictures in an instant and thus saves the clumsy,time,and battery-consuming process of loading them by direct camera-to-computer method. If you've read about the battery life problem you'll be prepared for burying the included batteries on the first day. Others recommend rechargeables, but I've always hated them. They don't last long, and I don't like the hassle. I put in new lithium batteries and they really last. As far as actual picture taking, the only two negatives I see are problems with blurry images of moving subjects and  the lack of a real zoom feature. The zoom feature on this camera merely crops in on your existing image. However I see these  points as minor as the beauty of the picture quality, and sheer fun in using this camera make it a winner. Besides, if you want to zoom in on a shot, just take three or four steps in, and you'll be saving yourself about ... bucks. Out of all the regrettable purchases I've made in my life, I can say this is not one of them.

The instructions aren't anything to write home about, but they suffice.  The included software takes a little getting used to but it does do the job, just not as easily as some of the aftermarket stuff. The most  amazing thing about this camera (compared to both 35's and other digital  cameras I have used) is that it is almost impossible to take anything but a  high res. perfect picture. The macro mode is fun too, and good for online  auctions or any application where a detailed closeup is needed.  I am very  pleased with my purchase.

I also bought the standalone mediacard reader; it installed on my PC like a champ  with absolutely no problems.  Together the two components make for a great  experience!  Even the 8meg card that comes with the camera seems roomy  enough for the kinds of web images that I want to mostly make.  My only  criticism is that there is a considerable delay from when you push the  button until the picture is actually taken -- but I see this same phenomena  with other cameras (both film and digital); it seems to have more to do  with focusing and red-eye reduction than anything else.

The picture quality is much better than I expected it to be, and it is very easy to use.  I was also impressed with the software that comes with the camera and what I was able to do with  pictures after I took them.  Its amazing how good pictures come out in low  light with no flash.  Since it is so much less expensive than the 450 Zoom,  it doesn't have a traditional zoom, it has a digital zoom, which functions  like a traditiional telephoto lens.  So when I want a zoom, I walk closer  to the subject.  The camera lets you take perfect pictures only 4 inches  away from your subject, and that is pretty cool.  My advice:  If you have  $500, get the 450 zoom, if you don't want to spend that much, the D360L is  a great camera and I'm very satisified with it.", "Date": "March 21, 2000"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "Giuseppe A. Paleologo \"gappy\"", "ReviewID": "R2JVPIGO9M70AJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The little Olympus is an excellent digital camera for photo amateurs (like me and 99.99% of you). It's rightly considered excellent value for the price, for a number of reasons.Images: the quality of images ranges from  very good to acceptable. The resolution is high enough for album-size  prints, and for web posting. As far as I could tell, the optical group is  good (no distorsions and luminosity gaps).Usability: shooting commands  are very easy, although exposure correction and \"film\"  sensibility can take some time to set up. Nice features are the ability to  shoot sequences and to have wide/spot exposure meter. The \"macro\"  option works fine, but the \"2x\" option is almost worthless to me.  It's better to magnify the section of interest in the editing  phase.Built-in editing: the camera commands are also very easy to use  (you just have to keep the shutter closed). You can view your pictures on a  TV without needing a computer. You can zoom over a picture section. More  important, you can easily store/access/erase pictures, and the quality of  the LCD screen is good (brightness can be adjusted). Downoading images on a  PC/Mac is straightforward too. Overall, it took me less than one hour to  become aquainted with the camera proper.Now with the downsides. The  plastic case has a fragile silver finish which can be scratched too easily.  The camera consumes a lot of power, but life can be extended by keeping the  LCD off, although it is tempting not to. Finally, for a total extra cost of  $50, I would advise you to buy a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a  charger (NOT Olympus: too expensive) and an additional 16Mb+ smartmedia  card (also usable of Rio and other MP3 players).", "Date": "June 2, 2000"}, {"Title": "Picture perfect", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RKG7LYAVDA897", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to CNET to get a good value digital camera review.

The image quality is astonishing for a product of this price range and the generated files are small, ideal for the web or e-mail. You can apply lots of zoom without pixelation. It's very easy to use. The manual is comprehensive and user-friendly. Buy a  protective case, because the camera doesn't include one and is fragile. You  can carry the SmartMedia cards in it, too. It's worth the money. We have  two of this toys (my father's and mine) and we are very pleased. Don't  forget that Olympus is an excellent brand. The bundled software is fine for  most purposes, but if you want more tweaking on the images, you can use  Corel, PhotoShop, etc. The ideal complement for this camera is a 16 Mb.  SmartMedia card. Don't rush buying it (the memory card) because the prices  are very unstable ... My advice: compare before  you buy. You don't need to buy Olympus-brand memory cards. They are  expensive (Look for other brands like SanDisk), and the only advantage that  they have over the generic cards is the Panorama function (the ability to  take 3 or 4 photos and link them) The camera price is very stable, online  or at a retail store. Consider buying a battery charger, because if you use  the screen too much to take photos, it will drain the batteries quickly.  (Use instead the optical viewer to take photos and the LCD screen to review  them). I have a Kodak charger with NiMH batteries and it works really nice.  Don't use alkaline batteries, because they don't last for long. If you buy  the D360L at some stores, you will be offered with a 4-year full-protection  program. It's worth considering. We are really happy with the camera. One  drawback: The downloading time is long via serial port, specially if you  have a big SmartMedia card with many images.

Very good camera,  with some limitationsPros:  - Excellent images within the 1.3  Megpixel limits  - Very good sensitivity in dark/ shadowed areas -- but  contrast can swamp subtle shadings.  - Easy to use for most settings.  I had it up and taking pictures within about 5 minutes, although figuring  out all the bells& whistles took a while.  Panoramic pictures are very  nice, although you have to be careful in how you compose the set of  pictures to get good splicing in the computer.  - Camedia software is  pretty good, although there are better image processing software available.  - Downloading is easy although somewhat slow with the serial  connection.Cons  - Eats batteries.  Buy some rechargable NiMH  batteries and a charger on your way home from the store.  I keep a set  charged at all times and swap them out every time I take the camera out.  Works great that way.  Very very seldom run out of power when using the  camera.  LCD works very well, but will drain your batteries.  -  Viewfinder does *NOT* show accurate depiction of what the image to be  captured.  Use the LCD for proper image composition (but doesn't work in  direct sunlight), or be willing to crop the pictures on the computer  -  At low light levels is very sensitive to movement and blurring of images  (not unexpected).  - It's not 35 mm resolution;  there are limits on  enlarging pictures before running into pixel limitations.  For point and  shoot though, it's great.  - 2x digital zoom is a feature of very  limited usage. Figure you're buying a camera without zoom, and you won't  come in with adverse expectations.  Almost never used.Tips &  Comments  - We're getting almost 35 mm photo quality outputs from a HP  Inkjet printer (PSC 500) and HP premium photo paper.  The pictures look  good on white bond paper, but the difference with high quality photo paper  is amazing.  - We've only filled the 8 MB card a couple of times and  wished we could download the pictures to take more.  A few minutes editing  using the thumbnail display on the LCD can delete bad pictures and reduce  the number of images on the card to take more pictures.  We do download the  camera every night and clean the images off the card.  - Our breakeven  was an estimated 30 rolls of film -- if we used the camera more than 1000  images we would have found it worth it.  We took 400+ pictures alone on a  cruise to Alaska, and then listened to a friend complain about the $150  developing cost they had from their 35 mm film rolls.  - We had the  policy of not taking \"scenery\" shots with the 35 mm since we  didn't want to waste money taking pictures without a person in the picture.  With the digital camera we just take pictures.  The change in attitude to  taking pictures is striking.  We find the marginal cost per picture is near  zero -- unless you print them out.  That cost is around $0.10-0.25 per 1/4  page picture.Overall  - Very happy with this camera, once we've  learned its foibles.  Its not perfect, but very good.  When we're going out  on a family outing, we now just slip the camera in a pocket and take it  along.  We take 10x as many pictures due to the simplicity of digital  imaging and the quality of this camera.  - We highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Buy This Camera!", "Author": "Mark Van Patten \"Herman Munster wasn't real.\"", "ReviewID": "R2HHMDTZ7484Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a point and shoot digital for use in our office where camera technical skills are few.

About fifteen of those were with flash. I took my new toy to London where my charger would not work so I took a bunch AA Alkelines as back up. They are still in the unopened package.

As  soon as I got mine, we played around with it off-n-on for no more than 3 or  4 hours before the brand-new alkaline batteries were useless. Flashes and  the built-in monitor really suck 'em dry.Now, besides that, the Olympus  D-360L is my first digital camera. Now I'm not really great at taking  pictures, so I put most of the settings on \"auto\" and hope that I  can Photoshop them into looking better later on. The picture quality is  good overall, but if you want any sort of details captured, you'll have to  use the largest pixel size available, and zoom in, too. So forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from 25 rows back. Most of my work  is on the internet, so it's great for web publishing, but I doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out -- but I haven't  really tried yet, either.The compact design is quite good, so I can't  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week. I  know I've carried mine around in my rough-n-tumble book bag for weeks on  end, and it hardly has a scratch on it. If you want to change the camera's  settings, there's a lot of button pushing to change the shutter,  white-balance, and image file size options. My friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes, or to  zoom in, or to take the picture over again because I flashed when I didn't  want to. And there's a slight delay between when I've pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic. \"Capturing the moment\" often takes  a couple mintues to prepare. Also, the pictures I've taken often look  fantastic on the LCD monitor, but are fuzzy when I download  them.Downloading is a snap ... sort of. Just install the software once,  then hook the cable up to your serial port and ... wait. It takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures. Heck, it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor. The editing software included is  okay, but it's no Photoshop.The very first weekend I had it, I went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze. Surprisingly, most of the photos came out great -- very  fun and colorful -- except when the flash goes off, people often have red  eye (which is fixable through adjustments) or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts. And if I didn't use the  flash, then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light. It definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the fly.In comparison, though, for  the price you pay here, you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device. The low-light photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black. I haven't yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose; it always seems to automatically compensate.  Also, the multi-photo \"panoramic\" option and the \"action  sequence\" modes are fun to play with, but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run.

This means that reds and greens are accurately  recorded but there's a lot of graininess/noise in the blues.  This is a  common problem in all CCD-based devices, including scanners, and when  determining imaging quality, the blue channel is very revealing.  Under  most circumstances, though, you get an acceptable image.  Second, the user  interface is a little clumsy; you have to close the cover to review images.  The buttons do different things in different modes, and sometimes it's  hard to remember which is which.  Finally, I think it should've come with a  USB cable as well as a 9-pin serial.

We were definitely not disappointed.The D-360L was  the next step up from the D-340R. Then and today you cannot find a better  quality camera at this price, outside of the Olympus family.  The 360 has  all the same features of the 340-R, but adds capabilities to adjust white  balance, and tinker with spot metering, ISO and exposure settings.  It also  adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen, as well as  multiple flash and file compression settings.If you want additional zoom  power you'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $100 more.  It  adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview  screen.  If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try  looking for a D-340R.  They are still around at onine shops andit is a  great camera on the cheap!  All three of the camera have the same lens,  megapixel size etc.Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days  owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and  Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home. The camera  performed marvelously. We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more  than adequate for our needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into  our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? The 360 will  use up to a 32MB smart media card, enough for 400+ shots at low resolution.", "Date": "September 5, 2000"}, {"Title": "It hasn't let me down yet!", "Author": "Renee", "ReviewID": "R1BJAUFSGAF6IM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera - it's my first digital one and although I can't compare it to others, I have been very satisfied with the Olympus D-360L.

They advertise the camera as being Mac compatible via a serial port.Well, Macs haven't shipped with serial ports for YEARS. Why not USB?!I had to buy a [price] adapter by Belkin (about the only one in existance that would connect this camera to my G3 at the time). The images download SLOOOOOOOW via a serial port. USB is a much faster architecture. Of course, firewire is 100 times faster than USB, but since Windows hasn't caught up to the technical advances of Mac yet, USB would have been sufficient for a cross-platform market.When you're using Olympus's proprietary software to download the images from your camera, you can't do anything else... it does not function in the background. Very sloppy programming... no need for such a simple process to take up so much of the system heap.The camera uses 4 (four) AA batteries, which add to the weight of the camera significantly. If you use the LED screen in the back of the camera, prepare to carry an additional 12 AA batteries with you for a day-long shoot, because you're going to be changing batteries at least 3 times in order to shoot a single day on a vacation... this camera eats batteries for breakfast.This also  applies if you use the flash. There is very little warning that the batteries are low... when there is almost no juice left, a pitiful battery icon will flash briefly in the view finder and then that's it.  This camera does not use rechargable batteries....About 8 months after owning this camera, I started noticing a delay in response time. I'd click on the shutter release and a full second and a half would pass before the picture would be taken. This is too much of a delay! The picture should take immediately... just like it does on a 1955 Brownie Hawkeye. If I'm trying to shoot an action shot or an animal or a child, every split second matters... when I click, the picture should be taken immediately, not a week later. Fresh batteries don't make a difference in the delay.The camera does take some half-way decent 640x480 JPEG shots, but the camera is slow in writing them to disk, which means you can't take the photos quickly in succession.  You also can't delete a bad shot on the camera, so even if a shot is awful, you're stuck with it until you load the disk into the computer to delete the shot... which means you have to wait for the ENTIRE roll of shots to load into the program and download in order to even delete them.There are some great bargains to be had in the computer world.... This is not the case with digital cameras. You truly get what you pay for. After being exposed to some very nice digital still cameras and digital camcorders, I can confidently say that this little Olympus is one of the worst I've ever used, and should definitely be a last choice for anyone using a Macintosh.", "Date": "January 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Wonderful bargin, excellent camera!", "Author": "Julie Martin", "ReviewID": "R252LQV9G6F868", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this after reading all the great reviews about it.

It takes suprisingly good pictures.  It helps to understand the weaknesses of digital photography when using any digital camera.  Digital cameras will not give great rendition in low light situations.  In fact low light settings are often best handled without using the flash to avoid adding contrast to the photo.  I've seen a number of reviews where users complained about low lighting performance using the flash.  This may indicate a lack of digital camera experience.  The average in camera flash is only good within 8 feet.  This is very critical with digitals because shadow areas are digitals weak point.  Other than that caution you'll find this camera allows you to easily take great pictures.  I've often been surprised at how good the photos come out, even with this small number of pixels.  I've printed all types of photos from this camera up to 8x10 (not a recommended size).  It easily produces very good 3x5, 4x6 and 5x7 prints.

Excellent!", "Author": "Terrance Shaw", "ReviewID": "R3DNYXPLLTE8Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, I've got to say... this is perhaps the best camera that I've ever owned. A major step up from my first digital camera (a Mustek VDC-3500-which I'd highly recommend against), and even better than my Sony DCR-TRV130 Digital8 Camcorder (which isn't focused on taking photographs anyway), the Olympus D-360L is a dream come true. From the 1.8\" LCD screen to the sixty-four (64) megabyte (no, that's not a typo; the D-360L that I bought came packaged with a 64Mb SmartMedia chip in addition to the 8Mb chip packaged originally with the camera ... The photo quality of images taken with the camera is hardly anything to scoff at, and if you've got advanced image-editing software (i.e., Adobe Photoshop), then you can make an excellent image look even better!The only downside that I've managed to find to the camera, is the same problem that countless others have pointed out: the low battery life. But, as people have recommended, this problem can be overcome with nothing more than either a large pack of AA batteries, or just by buying a dozen or so rechargeable batteries and switching out between them. There are additional quirks that I've got against the camera, but nothing that can't be overcome by spending a couple dollars or so. First, it's the fact that the D-360L camera uses a serial connection for uploading images to your computer. This means that you're in for somewhat of a wait, unless you buy a SmartMedia memory reader. But no worries! You can buy an extremely affordable SmartMedia reader ...for [very little]! ... When I plugged the SmartMedia reader into my computer, it immediately picked up on what it was, and installed the drivers automatically, without any necessary disc (although a drivers disc does come with the reader), as I'm running the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. But what I found to be the most interesting thing about the reader is this: it doesn't transfer the images through a TWAIN interface, but instead, shows up as a drive in My Computer, where you can just copy, paste, and delete the file(s) right there! Now isn't that convenient?As a matter of fact, if you're a Mac user, I'd really recommend that you purchase a SmartMedia reader, because it's only an added twenty dollars, and the investment is well worth it in the long run. ... In addition to rechargeable batteries and the SmartMedia reader though, I'd recommend that you also purchase an AC adapter for the camera to save battery-life while you're transferring the images (this is of course, unnecessary if you purchase a SmartMedia reader).All in all, I'd say that the Olympus D-360L digital camera was the best [money] that I've ever spent on a computer-related gadget, and I know that, if you can see past it's few (small) flaws, you'll really love this, as it's a great product, entrance level or not. My final verdict is five out of five for the camera, and I'd encourage EVERYONE to buy one of these.Here's a bit of an update (August 04, 2002).  Recently, I went on vacation with my dad to Philadelphia.  Well, I went to visit Hershey Park to check out the Dolphin show, starring Clovis and Wee Tee.  The show was excellent, albeit rather short\ufffdweighing in at fifteen minutes, plus fifteen minutes of sea lions.  In any event, I took a LOT of pictures while I was there, and I began to notice that the camera was a bit slow with taking the pictures.  It took around perhaps two to three seconds to process each image in high-quality mode.  Although it might not seem like a lot of time in between pictures, it's an aeon, when your subjects are fast-paced Dolphins!

At high quality (JPEG) you can get 36 pictures on the 8MB card, and presumably, with  the 64MB card ... ... that wouldbe  288 pictures! With the LCD off, the battery usage isn't too badeither. I also find that the closeup pictures (the macro mode) is also quite good, though the flash is overpowering in these situations. I'll probably experiment with a flash diffuser, possibly something as simple as a piece of white paper over the flash in these cases.For Macs though, be prepared to work through a few problems. First of all, the cable that converts the PC serial connector to the Macintosh serial connector (for older macs like mine) isn't in the box, despite the label on the box which indicates that it's mac compatible. There's a coupon you can mail to get this connector free, but it should be in the box in my opinion. For modern macs, one would probably have to buy a USB smartmedia card reader.Knowing this however, I also bought the SanDisk FlashDisk  adapter that allows you to read smartmedia cards from your floppy disk drive (also gone in modern Macintosh computers). It too claimed to be mac compatible but it too lacked any actual support in the box. There was NO software for the mac. I had to download the drivers from the internet.Then I found the drivers claimed that OS8.6 was necessary (I was running OS 8.5.1). I was able to read single image files off the flashdisk, but not two or more. I installed 8.6 but found I had the same problem. I was subsequently able to download multiple files when I directed them to a subdirectory instead of the desktop. I can't say for sure that this alone was the cause of the problem, but at least the whole combination worked.8x10's are somewhat unsatisfying (of course) but 4x5's made with the camera are really good.

In my opinion, the D-360L is  probably the best under-$300 digital camera on the market.", "Date": "June 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Affordable and reliable plus quality and features.", "Author": "Paul Webb", "ReviewID": "R112POYNP489L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EXCELLENT!  I bought this camera largely based on the reviews that i saw here in Amazon.com. I have to say that the 5-star reviews this camera has been receiving are right on the money. This camera has everything the  normal every day user would need as well as features that the advanced user  would appreciate. Picture quality is generally very good. The 5 different  picture quality settings give you the ability to use this camera for a  variety of uses (home, office, web etc). There are so many options such as  panoramic pictures, zoom/macro, ISO settings, slow shutter speeds for  night/low light conditions etc.. And the 1.3 Megapixel resolution is  excellent for this range of 'entry level' digital cameras. This camera is  also very good for night use as it seems to be able to handle a variety of  lighting levels quite well.  When you consider the price it really is a  VERY good buy.

I was a camera snob. Then had kids  and couldn't be bothered to lug around an SLR plus attachments. With the  excuse that I was buying it for my wife, I purchased one of the original  Olympus clamshell designs in 1992. Secretly I loved this little camera. Not  long after I sold the cherished Nikon. So it goes.But after 8 years, the  trusty Olympus was showing it's age. And the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times. So I was in search  of its replacement.I'm comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camera.I was intrigued  sufficiently to visit Wolf Camera and look at one.If a picture is worth  a thousand words, experiencing something must be worth at least  10,000.Unlike its 35mm cousins (Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera  comes to mind and is what I wound up buying) this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different company.It is large; won't  fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.It is heavy.It is square and  boxlike (none of the Stylus Epic's sensuous lines).If you are attracted  to one-shot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the web.", "Date": "July 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "For Mac owners, total regrets", "Author": "David M.

Then they don't send it.  When you call, they act as if you are the only Mac user on the planet and can't understand what you want.  Finally, you give in to buying one of their Reader-Writers.  Weeks later you receive it and then try to use it.  It doesn't work and your Mac continually freezes and has to be restarted. You still can't down-load your pics.Customer service from Olympus is a joke. A major joke. When after a half hour you get through the system, they don't know the product and continually misunderstand what they're telling you.  Don't waste your time trying to get any substantial help.  This camera is not for Mac owners.This camera was a gift from my daughter. I'm sad that she wasted the money.  I keep it because I can download it on to a friend's PC.
