{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My new Sony A37", "Author": "Richard Evans", "ReviewID": "R2TPXND4JO9U8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Five years ago I sold my Sony DCS-F717 which was a great camera for an all in one and decided to get a DSLR.  I bought the A100 because of the built in image stabilization and the ability to use Minolta lenses. Five years ago it was easy to find Minolta lenses for very low prices as no one was sure Sony would put such a great effort into making an entire line of DSLR's. I started with a 50 mm f1.7. Then I found a 24-85 mm f3.5/4.5 which has become my favorite lens because it's very sharp, relatively light and offers good range. Then I found the 100 mm f2.8 Macro which is a superb lens and was top rated (same rating as the Leica) by Colorfoto (a German magazine) which ran a test on various macro lenses.All of these lenses only cost me a few hundred dollars so buying into the Minolta/Sony A-Mount system is a real bargain compared to Canon/Nikon lenses. I also have the Sony 75-300 mm f4.5/5.6 which is a copy of the Minolta lens. Over the course of the last five years I've discovered that the A100 is too large and heavy to drag around for casual shooting and it's low light performance was limited. Also it doesn't shoot video so I used a Sanyo Xacti HD-1010 as my video camera. I had to decide which was more important. Video with poor quality stills on the Sanyo or high quality stills but no video on the Sony.Recently I started investigating the options. After much research I was all set to buy the new Sony NEX F3. Then I went to look at it and immediately I struggled to read the tiny font and icons. Just about everyone will eventually suffer from Presbyopia which a difficulty to focus on close up objects. This can be easily corrected with reading glasses but I don't want to carry around a set of glasses to take photos. Moreover it means constantly looking up to see distant objects in focus. That's when I decided I still wanted a camera with a viewfinder. But I was still attracted to the size of the Nex which I could use if I bought the optional viewfinder. When shooting videos I loved the accessory microphone input on the Sanyo. Unfortunately the Nex cameras require you to buy one specific Sony microphone. Also NEX cameras use a new E mount lens which means you need an adapter to use A mount lenses. So by the time you buy the viewfinder, the microphone and the mount adapter you've spent twice the price of the camera. Way more than was in my budget. My goal was to sell the A100 and the Sanyo and use the proceeds to buy a new camera.Enter the Sony A37 with Single lens Translucent technology.This is really a huge advance over using a camera with a flip up mirror which was invented in 1949. For the first time Sony has also included all of the features of the higher end cameras in their entry level A37. The A37 is a NEX-F3 in an Alpha SLT format.The size of the A37 is perfect for me. The grip on the A37 has been improved with a deeper groove for your fingers. I tried out the A57. It's much bigger and heavier than the A37. I have to grip really hard to hold it one handed (just like I did with the A100.)  The A37 is much lighter and smaller which means that it fits perfectly in a small camera bag together with a couple of spare lenses. The camera and the 18-55 mm lens weighs just a pound and a half.I mostly use the EVF (which includes diopter correction) but when I need the LCD I have no issues at all with it. Of course, I don't review photos on it. No camera LCD is good enough to reliably do that. The tilt mechanism makes it easy to compose shots that require you to hold the camera above or below you. If you don't use the EVF as your primary composing tool then I would suggest you look at the NEX F3 as it's an otherwise great camera that just lacks the things I want such a built in EVF and support for A mount lenses without an adapter.For $600 my new A37 does everything I want it to do. Great images and videos are just as good as more expensive cameras. I only shoot mp4 videos so the lack of 1080p AVCHD won't be missed. Standard h264 mp4 video is so much easier to edit than AVCHD.The A37 has the 3rd generation of the Bionz processor which is also used in all of the current generation of  SLT and NEX cameras including the flagship model the A77.This new processor allows for better low light shot with an ISO range from 100 to 16,000.In addition the new processor makes possible continuous 15 point phase detection auto focus, 5.5 fps shooting at full resolution and full HD video recording.Together with a 16mp sensor and a good lens such as the 18-55 you have everything you need to take great photos. Features such as clear image zoom that can digitally extend the range of any lens and a viewfinder with 100% coverage are wonderful.Anyone can operate this camera which now has two auto settings; intelligent auto and superior auto which makes it possible for even a beginner to take great photos.Let me know if you have questions and thanks for watching.I'm not a beginner. I've been a photographer for 4 decades and this is the best camera I've ever owned. The A37 is a major upgrade from my previous camera both in image quality and in handling.The 3 things to consider are the processor, the image sensor and the lens. I own 3 Minolta lenses and 2 Sony lenses. They are all good to excellent and that includes the 18-55 'kit' lens. With a new 3rd generation Bionz processor, a 16mp sensor and the 18-55 lens you will have everything you need to take excellent photos.The specs are awesome because this is one awesome camera. Sure Sony has to offer some 'step up' features in other models but they are really nothing essential.You will also have spent less which you can use to buy accessories such as an extra battery, a fast SDHC card and some great used Minolta lenses.These reviews are helpful; [...] Rated Essential.[...]First place.[...] 'I know it seems like I'm \"Mr. Sony is perfect\" but honestly there is very little not to like about this camera at its price point. It is so exciting to watch Sony announce cameras that trounce the competition.'[...] Editors Choice. 'The camera's small size works in its favour as well by making the camera easy to pick up and take with you.'", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top Notch Entry Level Camera w/ Advanced Features", "Author": "JoeD Freelance Pro Photographer & Blogger \"| ...", "ReviewID": "R3KYC0BDUQTEK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had the opportunity to test the Sony Alpha A37 (SLT-A37) with the Sony 18-55mm lens.  As an avid life-long Nikon Shooter, I welcomed the opportunity to try another \"non-pro\" brand, specifically the Sony Alpha series, which seems highly regarded by amateurs and even advanced amateurs.  My review and rating of the A37 is based on the camera within its own class as opposed to an unfair comparison to a Nikon D300s or D800 for example, which are priced much higher and target a different shooter group with different needs.  Please note Sony's designation of SLT indicates replacement of the optical viewfinder with an electronic one and relies upon a translucent mirror.  This is a major differentiation to DSLR's.The Sony Alpha A37 is best described as an advanced entry level DSLR camera. At $600 (I expect a minor 5% price drop in the future) with the Sony 18-55mm lens, it represents a great way for shooters to enter into the DSLR range or expand from lower ranked DSLR camera and is priced lowest in the Sony Alpha line.  But, as with most brands, you are committing to specific branded lenses; in this case, Sony and Minolta \"A-mount\" lenses.  This is not necessarily bad because you will save thousands of dollars when compared to Nikon or Canon.  I am not aware of any converters allowing use of Nikon or Canon branded lenses.  But, out of the box, you get everything you need including the 18-55mm lens, which would provide most people most of the focal length they need in day to day use, as well as on-camera flash, charger (wall type), battery, strap, and Sony Software. At the wide end of the included 18-55mm lens, the end most used by casual shooters, you have the ability to get creative out of the box- a big plus in today's economy.Highlights of the A-37 Feature Set-New 16.1 mp CMOS Sensor-100% viewfinder coverage-Intelligent pixel upscaling-ISO 100-16000-Onboard picture effects processing-1080p 24/60i HD AVCHD format video-Dedicated stereo microphone and mic input-7 frames per second burst rate (reduced 8.4mp resolution rate)-On camera stabilizationFor prior Sony A35 shooters, Dpreview notes: \"the changes are subtle - the A37 gains the A57's improved viewfinder optics, and it becomes the only SLT not to shoot 60p video - instead offering 60i and 24p as its highest frame rate options, both at 24Mbps. The A35's continuous shooting rates are unchanged, with the camera offering 7 frame-per-second bursts at reduced resolution (8.4MP) in a mainly automated mode.\"  I felt it important to include this information as I did not own any other Sony Alpha cameras for comparison.\"I tested the camera in controlled indoor conditions as I first test all my Nikon cameras prior to field use.  To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I found the camera very ergonomic and well balanced, thus easy to hold at about a combined 25 ounces with the 18-55 attached. Of course, it does not have the build quality of a Nikon D300s or D700.  But, that's not the point at a $1,200 to $2,200 difference.  Of particular note to existing Sony Alpha line shooters is the significant size difference between the much larger A57 ($800) and the A37.  This lends the A37 more ergonomic to women with smaller hands.  The manual controls on the camera, primarily within range of the right thumb when shooting, are mostly easily accessible and intuitive, providing a higher degree of non-menu driven manual exposure control.Impressive with this camera is the 100% electronic viewfinder coverage at 1.09 magnification, a differentiation among pros-level cameras as I know very few serious shooters willing to shoot with less than 100% viewfinder coverage, myself included. Live-view (no virtual horizon on this model), available on the Sony A37, is a much hyped feature.  However, as a portrait photographer, I never found practical use for it on any of my Nikons though landscape and macro shooters will undoubtedly use such a feature.  The camera's 15-point autofocus system is arranged towards the center in sharp comparison to my Nikon usage. The autofocus system can be set to single, continuous or automatic - a hybrid of the two that responds only when it senses subject movement.  Thanks to the design focusing is very fast, especially for an entry level camera at this price point.  On continuous autofocus, the A37 really shines. Image quality is superb with adequate detail in shadows. Of incredible importance, though understated in the literature is the RAW shooting ability of the camera that translates will with Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) if needed.  The A37's ISO 100-16,000 equivalent range is exceptional at lower ISO settings and still good OK at ISO 1600. At ISO 6400 detail becomes smudged and process-sharpened edges show as artifacts. ISO 12,800-16,000 do not have practical use in my opinion except for emergency situations with no other alternative.Another impressive feature that worked in my tests is the \"Steady Shot INSIDE\" (like Nikon VR or Canon IS on their respective lenses). Unlike the larger DLSR makers, Sony built stabilization inside the camera as opposed to lenses. This provides stabilization regardless of the lens type and ultimately at reduced cost. The A37 also incorporates Sony's proprietary Translucent Mirror Technology, eliminating the need to raise and lower the mirror, providing fast continuous shooting at speeds of up to 10 fps in Continuous Priority AE mode.  This speed really pushes Sony out ahead in its class and price range.Not impressive is the rear 2.7 inch screen at 230k resolution.  While most pro's don't rely on the rear screen to check exposure, most amateurs do. Such a small screen at this resolution does not provide a good method in this regard. But to be honest, even checking a Nikon rear screen in broad daylight can be difficult. Also not impressive, though not unexpected, is Sony's continued reliance on its proprietary hot shoe and memory cards. Not a big deal if you stay vested in the line/ brand.As for video performance, I will have to leave a detailed review to other reviewers since I rarely shoot video.In conclusion, the Sony A37 hits the mark for the intended audience.  It will provide good performance in typical shooting scenarios of amateurs. However, as you move into the creative realm of photography (think fashion and fine art), you will encounter some difficulty pushing the gear envelope. At higher ISO's you will experience significant noise and will need to move to prime or fast lenses and flash to get the ISO down. Frame rate bursts are reduced when shooting RAW and the rear screen leaves a lot to be desired in terms of resolution.  The camera also tends to underexpose, which is no big deal really- except to die hard exposure fanatics.  But once again, at this price point the camera is a very solid buy for amateurs and allows expansion into more advanced Sony Alpha cameras.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera for

camera apart ?PHOTOS====== [**] 16.1 MP images - the images come out crystal clear and mindblowing.  Tried to print them on a  13x19 sheet and it looks even better. [**] Low light sensitivity - I shot a couple of images inside a home and they came out very good without using flash.  I try to minimize the use of flash since natural light photography is always good.  If you are doing a lot of low light photography, I would suggest you to buy a 50mm lens which allows a lot of light to come through the lens: Sony 50mm f/1.8 SAM DT Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras [**] Shooting speed - The camera can shoot at the rate of 7 shots per seconds which is versatile for a variety of applications.  Someone new to DSLR may wonder as to why this is important.  To give you an example - if you are shooting a sports scene - it is humanly impossible to shoot the exact image that you are looking for.  So what you do is to hold the shoot button and the camera keeps clicking the images continually.  And finally you select one of them which best represents your action. [**] Panorama & 3D Images - This is something which is really exciting and cant wait for my next hiking trip to shoot panoramic images.  If you are looking at a mountain range and want to get the full scope of the mountains - so far there was no way to do it other than a video.  Now, with the Sony Alpha A 37 - you can continually shoot images with your camera and the camera will automatically stitch the images for you into a panoramic image.  I tried this around my home and a local park and having been endless fun with it.  Similarly you can shoot 3D images - which I tried, but was not able to test it since I do not have a 3D TV.VIDEOS=======If you are planning to buy this camera for videos - stay away and buy a Camcorder.The quality of the images is really good, but there is a fundamental problem which is extremely annoying.The earlier cameras which came out lacked a basic problem - the cameras could never autofocus while shooting video.When I got the Sony Alpha A37 - it advertised itself as having continuous autofocus while shooting video.  But it was a major disappointment ...The feature works - it does do an autofocus while shooting video, but the sound of the focus motor gets recorded along with the video.  Means if you are shooting a video of your kid playing, the video quality is awesome, your kid is always in focus and shot at Full HD mode, but you are going to have this humming sound of the autofocus motor as a background sound when you play back your video an it is predominant.I have a Canon T2i DSLR and this has the same problem as the Sony alpha A37 where it records the autofocus sound on the video.Summary=======Overall, I highly recommend this camera for photography, but not so much for videos - it is better than the Canon T2i - in terms of both features like Panoramic images,  7 FPS and low light sensitivity.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for money", "Author": "generation y", "ReviewID": "R3ETBCE6YTGB7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very pleased so far 1 month after receiving the camera.Image quality is very high and build quality is solid so it should last.Some pros/cons:+ Image quality.

Chin Chance", "ReviewID": "R1JEPLLS1QQJE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the A100 and A700 from Sony and have found them to be worthwhile cameras with pros and cons like any other brand. Initially I was quite hesitant about getting one of their new mirrorless offerings.Camera came a day later than I expected but hey it was the midst of the holiday season, so no big thing. These comments are not intended to be very technical/professional  but from the viewpoint of a slightly above average user.1. The relatively small size and weight (compared to the A100 and the A700) were a surpise despite the fact that several reviewers mentioned how compact it was. This is a big plus for me since I am getting old and carrying anything the size and weight of an A700 gets to be a burden. The difference in weight may not seem much but to someone with arthritis it is a benefit. I thought about the NEx series and similar from Nikon but I really didn't want to get into changing lens mounts.2. The convenience of built in movie mode cannot be understated. It was no fun carrying around an A700 and a PS to take movies. While certainly not the best movie camera it is heads and shoulders above my trusty PS and the convenience over-rides any loss in quality.3. Image quality is at least equal to the A700 in my opinion. I know this is very subjective and highly dependent on non-camera body factors such as lens and subject etc. But for whatever it's worth I think the A37 offers the same quality photos as the A700.4. There is no doubt the A37 has far more menu choices and modes than the A700 and its generation. The one I found most interesting was the auto panoramic mode. It does work and the stitch quality may not completely please the purist but for most cases it beats the dickens out of manual panorama photography.Besides that I found it to be fairly forgiving since a tripod is not a must have for this to work.5. Burst mode is obviously significantly faster than the older generation of cameras but this is expected. This will be a major plus when I try to shoot pics of my grandkids.6. Battery life is not spectacular but from the relatively small battery on the average I get an estimated 350+ shots. I would say not bad at all.7. The 135mm lens the kit came with for $593 lives uo to the high ratings almost all the reviewers indicated.8. In my opinion it handles low lighting with a bit more ease and accuracy than the A700. Keep in kind I have only had it for  a few weeks.9. I would give the built in flash the edge over the A700 built in flash. More even lighting and seems a tad more powerful. Again, subjective rating not scientifically measured.10. Having the memory card and the battery in one compartment like many other brands makes more sense. I always had to fumble a tad with the A100 and A700 with the double compartments for battery and card.11. The buffer seems to be quite efficient since you can shoot quite a bit before the camera slows down. I would recommend using Class 10 memory cards anyhow. Why spend so much and then use the cheapest memory cards.Cons1. The menu system is confusing at times. However that may be somewhat due to my reluctance to read thru the manual.2. For such a small battery it certainly takes a long time to charge (250 minutes)! My Toshiba Thrive Tablet with a larger wattage takes half that time.3. The LCD viewing screen does not provde an accurate enough preview of your shots. The color seems off and overexposed. Others have berated Sony about this.4. Not sure this is a criticism but the A700 shots with several megapixels less in resolution have larger files sizes than the A37 files. Is this the result of higher JPG compression and a subsequent loss of quality? I don't know. But it does seem curious. Perhaps it is due to more efficient JPG compression software.That's all for now.

I mean its advertised that it has the same sensor, advertised that the Bionz engine is the same as the a77 and the only thing it seems to fault on is the lower rear screen and speed buffers and speed of fast shooting.  I am here to tell you with the same Sony 35mm f1.8 Alpha lens, it is NOT EQUAL in speed of focus and function based on my night time shooting.  Look, I am a HUGE Sony fanboy and I was willing to sacrifice the rear screen as well for the size.  BUT, once you've gotten use to 950K screen resolution and you go down to 230K, FORGET ABOUT IT.  So dim and viewing angles are SO POOR, you wonder WHY Sony even put the tilt screen on it.  YOU CANT see it in the other angles!  Then there is the viewfinder which the reviews and specs say its the exact same one as the a57, advertising the TrueView, something, well I had read on Cnet that she thought the view finder looked dim and SURE ENOUGH...IT IS NOT Bright as the a57!  This is huge for me to get over. Also, NO horizontal or verticle axis balance meter and that is another HUGE deal.  If you've gotten use to it in the a57 it takes the guess work out of if your pictures are balanced and most of mine I had to adjust afterwards but you never can really be sure IMO.  Ok, so back to the focusing.  IT WAS NOT GOOD compared to the a57.  Daytime, NO problem, my daytime pics looked GREAT as usual but I am into nighttime photography and IMO, it did not focus OVER HALF the time.  It would hunt and just be all off!  I HATE that I have to write this but IF you decided you dig the SLT Sony's PLEASE, upgrade to the a57 and you will be set!  It's got to be something they did in memory or something to cheapen the product.  If you read all the reviews from the a57, they all say ITS QUICK as hell, SNAPPY, FAST to focus.  I think sure they say its the same Bionz engine but if the fast frame shooting is lower by many frames and supposedly everything is the same, WHY is it slower?  Could it be to save the battery, voltage has been reduced and that's why focusing was way down?  Could that be the reason why the viewfinder is noticeably dimmer? Build wise, its SOLID, but again, that rear LCD screen can not be dismissed.  ITS AWFUL!  and you know how on the a57, you can even flip the screen completely around so that the back of the screen is solid black plastic, well you can't do that on the a37.  Yes I also know the argument that you don't need to be looking at the screen to compose or check for pics but I am telling you, it sure IS NICE to have and the cheapness when I compare it to my a57 is IMO, I can't live with.  Again, if it were just that I would be ok, but I don't know in seconds or official conditions as to why I sense it is slower but IT IS SLOWER ANd I CANNOT see any reason for you to chose this over the a57!  It's not worth the $100 savings.  Performance and speed is essential to me.  Now, I guess, if your just going to sit around taking pics of wall flowers...I guess this works and FYI, the a57 is not that bad in size and weight.

Although this is not my review, it is a review from a verified buyer on another site......someone who has purchased and used the camera, and therefore I think it is not out of place being presented along with rest of these reviews. The A37 he bought came with the 18-55mm zoom lens. Does anyone care to comment on his experience with this camera?Flawed GemThe Sony SLT-A37 has very good hardware and generally produces very good pictures. You can find several good reviews that present this and the camera's other strengths, such as its fast autofocus. I will instead mention an important shortcoming that you should know before you buy.In Program mode, the camera uses a minimum shutter speed of 1/60s and a maximum aperture of f/4.0 even in low light, even at the 18mm end of its kit lens, preferring to instead increase the ISO sensitivity instead. It is only after it reaches an ISO setting of 3200 that it reduces the shutter speed and opens the aperture further. This means that in low light it takes pictures at much higher ISO settings than it needs to and the pictures come out looking much worse than they need to. This also means that its in-body image stabilization provides no benefit and is only a marketing spec. There is no way to change or customize this behavior.You can try to overcome this limitation by shooting in Manual mode and selecting the shutter speed and aperture that is needed. However, then you will run into its second major limitation: there is no option for Auto ISO in Manual mode. That means you will have to select all settings manually for every shot, which is impractical if you plan to take more than a few, well composed pictures. After I encountered this limitation, I did some googling and apparently Sony is the only major camera maker that refuses to provide this simple feature. Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, etc all have this option in their DSLR or mirrorless offerings.Together, these limitations mean that this camera's performance in low light is simply unacceptable. Since this was the reason why I had bought it, I had to send it back. If low light performance is at all important for you, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you plan to shoot only in bright daylight, this camera will do a good job.No, I would not recommend this to a friend", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "dsldan", "ReviewID": "R3BL1WFGB6K4EX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this camera so far.

Having a Sony DSC-HX9V and a Sony DSC-HX7V .....many of the same advanced features that are on these point & shoots are on the A37.......especially in camera HDR...  Plus just I wanted to see what gives with Sony DSLR's these days.....I went to Sedona for two weeks in December...sun and then some snow...lots and lots of beautiful long lasting sunsets. I felt like this little A37 DSLR gave me a great new amount of versatility due to many of its point & shoot special features except it would be put down on a large sensor this time instead of the small sensors that are on all point & shoots...Though I brought with me a few Nikon D2Xs's (and other NIKON DSLR's), a Canon 40D with the f1.2 50mm lens,  I ended up using this Sony nearly all the time.Manually cleaning the sensor on this camera is the simplest of any DSLR I have ever had.  I used a Polaroid filter quite a bit but you have to be careful when doing a panorama sweep with one attached since it will give you an uneven blue sky.Fuji and Canon have quite a few bridge cameras out right now but I would argue this camera is light and priced in the bridge camera range re the Fuji HS50EXR.  I would buy this Sony A37 instead of the Fuji or Canon bridge cameras and with the 18-55mm kit lens....the 18mm to 150mm (I think that is the mm of the next kit camera lens on this model) is a lot more money but probably more versatile...EBAY has a bus load of Minolta lenses and so does KEH.com...I guess you have to be careful about the Minolta lenses a bit to make sure you don't get one that grinds?  Not sure but I think there might be some issues with some Minolta AF lenses being used on some of the Sony bodies...I would have to google that information but this might be a precautionary note.  Also they are selling lenses for the SONY NEX  and calling them ALPHA lenses as well but of course those don't fit the SONY DSLR line...so be careful about that as well...I was thinking about buying cine lens made by Rokinon/Samyang lens and getting an external mic for doing video.  Anybody do this yet?The fact is that bridge cameras still use a small sensor compared to a true DSLR like this Sony so that is another reason to consider this camera before you buy a bridge camera.  The only MAJOR gripe I would have with the Sony A37 is that the flip out LCD does not articulate to the side at all and you wonder WHY a company would go through the trouble of putting a partially articulating LCD on a camera after all these years!!  Just do it right the first time!!!! I guess it is better to have the A37's partially articulating LCD than none....I guess the problem is when you have full articulation it takes away some space on the left back hand side of the camera for some buttons for quick accessing certain features...The other issue I have with this A37 camera (not a gripe since it might just be \"me\"} is dealing with a circle or spot when the camera is pointed towards the sun...you can expect some flare but more like a spear of light rather than a circle.  I was able to mitigate this by angling the camera but it was unusual to get a perfect circle in the camera center rather than an angled spike of light....don't know if this has something to do with my technique, the kit lens, or the new translucent light transmission used in this camera and/or a combination of all three?  I might be the only one to have had this center circle spot flare?  I had never seen this type of sun glare resulting in a centered circle in any camera I have ever used. Has anybody else experienced this type of circle or spot caused by sun glare on this camera?  I contacted Sony about this flare spot issue and they had me send some samples which I did but they never got back to me so I just gave up.The battery life on this camera is excellent. You can buy cheap 3rd party batteries and chargers either here on Amazon or on EBAY....  In short, this camera feels like a Fuji, Panasonic, or Canon bridge camera but it is a true DSLR.  Plus this Sony A37 has all kinds of cool features you would find in the Sony point & shoot line.  Though some people on here say this is a good beginner DSLR model, that is nonsense.  This is a fun camera to augment my much heavier and more complex Nikons DSLR's.The whole thing is the image you have in your mind to catch......and if you have a camera that is fun to use and can do things your much more expensive cameras might not be able to do, then why not sling one of these along as well?You are not out a lot of cash...you might not EVER buy another Sony DSLR (in my case I just have mostly Nikon lenses and only have the Canon DSLR due to the fact Nikon does not make an F1.2 50mm auto focus lens). I can still use T-mount lenses on this Sony A37.The U.S. Air Force used to have small jet trainer named the T37 that was even used as an attack aircraft not just a trainer and it was called the A37!!  This little Sony A37 is a big surprise and no wonder this site gave its highest rating.Again...you might be a Nikon or Canon only person and don't want to start down some new mount (actually old mount) path. I considered that as well as I pondered this camera and then thought..what the heck...why not? It had all the fun features on those two Sony point & shoots that I love.This A37 camera will go with me everywhere from now on since it gives me a whole new array of tools that I would not have without some effort on my tried and true giant B52 battleship sized Nikons. This A37 can do fast moving sports/action photos as well....though I prefer to use my Nikon D2HS's, D1H's, and D1's for that kind of action.  BUT that being said, this SONY A37 does great with my granddaughter's softball league games...both the day and night games..The images I took in Sedona and around Flagstaff and Winslow and Tuba City came out great with the A37 ....I used it in conjunction with my Nikons so this is not an either/or proposition.  The A37 is just another tool in the holster you can pull out when you don't want to go to the tripod.....in camera HDR...in camera automatically stitched panoramas...hand held low light ease of use.  Give it chance if you think your photography needs these tricks available to you at times...This Sony A37 will bail you out..It is fun to use as well.If you are in the photojournalist school of taking images....this camera will play right into that non formal style of shooting...it's like a point & shoot (re all the cool Sony features) except it has a nice usable viewfinder and big sensor..  Lots of NIKON and CANON people secretly would LOVE to give these Sony DSLR's a chance so here is your chance without draining the checking account...Have some fun and buy an A37!!!  Sony has scrambled and scrambled to create some nifty DSLR's and you can look at this A37 as sort of a Whitman's Sampler chocolate box...They have done some really nice things here ...I decided to give them a chance on their DSLR line up and don't regret a second of it....", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "After a few weeks of use..", "Author": "mpb_23", "ReviewID": "R1MKM1KWZH514T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really enjoying this camera.

However the tilt feature makes this mostly a non-issue.  The EVF is huge compared to the viewfinder of the A100, and is better suited for shooting in dim situations.  I bright sunlight, you need to press you eye firmly against the EVF to be able to see, it is noticeably dimmer than the optical viewfinders of other cameras.  The EVF will surprise you sometimes, because it is what you see is what you get.  I remember scratching my head at the blue outdoors scenery out a window when the main lighting was incandescent.  I thought for a second and realized that is exactly the result when I would take a picture with my DSLR, but not at all what I would see through the optical viewfinder.  This camera is 100% live view all of the time, and the shot to shot speed doesn't suffer for it one bit.The buffer size is small, like by old Sony A100, but I was surprised how fast the shot to shot speed was.  I was accidently in continuous mode and shot 3 frames in slightly more time than my old DSLR could take one picture.

I am satisfied with this camera so far, however I've only had it about a week so I have not had a chance to put it through it's paces.  I was concerned about the grip, but this has not been a big issue for me even with my large hands.  I do prefer to the grip of the A57 and A65 more, however I appreciate the smaller size of this model.  I previously used micro four thirds equipment, so I am used to smaller equipment, this is not much bigger then my old Panasonic G1, however the lens mount sits farther out from the camera making the overall package bulkier.  I like that the sensor used in this camera is the same one used in other more advanced models, I am a skilled photographer and I do not use many of the automated modes, scenes, etc.  I'm not opposed to these, but I find that they often change settings that I can change myself since I am knowledgeable in how these affect the end result.  I primarily shoot using Aperture or Shutter priority, or manual mode.  I would like to have seen a couple custom modes to set up some different white balance settings, color modes, etc. But these are fairly easy to set up on the fly.  There is a dedicated depth of field button on the front of the camera next to the lens which is a welcome feature for an entry level camera.  There is also a button with a question mark on it on the back, when pushed it offers tips on taking pictures, I wish this was user definable, I don't need a how-to manual, but I would like a button to access the quality settings.  The screen on the back of the camera is ok as far as the resolution for composing the shot, but the viewing angles are horrible, anything other then straight on viewing makes it difficult to see, not usually an issue for me as I use the viewfinder predominantly, but it would have been nice to have a little better screen.  I am still undecided on this camera, I like the potential of this camera, however it has a lot of gimmicks that I will not find useful (panoramic, 3D, scenes, etc.) and admittedly I am not the target consumer for this camera, it is geared towards a new photographer that does not know much about the basics but still wants to take nice looking pictures, which I'm sure it can handle.  I find that investing in camera bodies is a waste of money, and from that stand point this offers the same image quality that one can get from Sony's higher end models at a significant savings.  I do not like the kit lens (18-55mm), it is mediocre in it's clarity and is too dark to be all that useful to me, I would have loved to be able to buy this camera bundled with the Sony 35mm F1.8 lens as this will be the lens I purchase to use primarily on this camera.  This camera offers a lot of bang for the buck, in addition to some cheap gimmicks it also throws in some features which will be useful to advanced photographers looking to upgrade on the cheap.To recap:Pros:High image quality for the moneyCompactComfortable grip and well laid out buttons (I don't smash buttons accidentally when shooting)A dedicated depth of field buttonSupport for Minolta lenses manufactured from the mid 1980's onPlug for an external micPlug for a remote shutter releaseSupport for two different kinds of memory (SD card and Sony memory stick)Cons:No decent lens offered with the kitLots of gimmick featuresQuestion mark button cannot be reprogrammedNo extra grip offered (a battery grip would be nice to have the option of adding)Viewing angles for rear screen are poorProprietary hot shoe (Not a big deal to me, but worth noting)UPDATE 2/18/2013I've shot with this camera much more and I can say I'm happier with it now then when I originally wrote my review.  The thing that stands out to me is that even at higher ISO's, the images are still quite usable.  I previously used a handful of micro 4/3 cameras, and while I loved the size and especially the Panasonic 20mm lens, I found the images good but lacking.  This is not the case with this camera, I feel like the images are pro quality, even if the camera is not.  I have become used to the controls and don't find myself as encumbered by them, I still wish I could do something else with the question mark button and custom settings modes would be great to allow for switching to a set of commonly used parameters quickly, but overall I am happy with my purchase.  Another thing to note is that I have added a couple older Minolta lenses to my kit and these work quite well.  They use the older \"screw drive\" focus mechanism, but this does not seem to make them any slower or otherwise hinder their use, and surprisingly they are no noisier then the kit lens with it's built in motor.  I am still impressed that this camera has the built in motor for these older screw focus lenses, this is something other manufacturers dropped in their cameras and therefore reduced the compatibility.  As far as I'm aware, any Minolta lens with mount onto this thing and work without any major compromises, which is great because there is a lot of good old glass out there that can be had at a bargain price!", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Eye Spectacular", "Author": "KYLE", "ReviewID": "R1AQSF5ZIDNABZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SO THE HOLIDAYS WERE HERE, AGAIN, IN ANOTHER NEW ENGLAND TOWN.

Being that I am just getting into it I didn't want to spend a fortune on a camera and equipment. So I did quite a bit of research on features I wanted, and features I could live without, as well as the price point I was comfortable with. I finally settled on the Canon T3. I t seemed like a good entry level camera that wouldn't break the bank. So, most of this review will be comparing the Sony Alpha SLT-A37K with the Canon T3 as that is what I am most familiar with and feature wise they are pretty close.If you are like me, then the advanced functions of an camera scare the crap out of you. Both the Canon and the Sony have a bevy of advanced functions, but to be honest if I looked at them funny I'd probably destroy half the universe so I'll leave them alone. Which brings us to the preset functions on each dial. For all intensive purposes both cameras are near identical in preset photo modes.Portrait, landscape, sport, etc. I tried my best to take comparative photo's with both cameras in as identical conditions as I could. The end results were mostly what I was expecting. For most modes the pictures between the two cameras were largely identical. However, the Sony had a slight edge when taking pictures in the \"Sport\" or fast moving mode. Not that the Canon was bad, but the Sony seemed to have just a touch more clarity and a degree or two of better constant focus. This was most noticeable when taking pictures of frisbee dogs in action, and even a tad more noticeable when accessing those pictures in a photo editing software.Another thing I noticed is when using a Class 4 memory card in the Sony the pictures had a much longer write time to the card than when using a Class 10 card. Granted, this is to be expected, but it was a considerable difference between the write speed of a Class 4 card in the Canon. Picture quality was unchanged, but with the slow down you are unable to get \"sequence\" shots as quick as you may like them.Both the Canon T3 and the Sony claim to record HD Video. In theory it's a great feature, but in my experience both cameras produced only passable in video quality. This could very well be a case of me not being familiar enough with the camera, settings, etc. The Canon had decent lighting, shake reduction, and frame rate - but the actual image quality was nothing to write home to mom about. The Sony on the other hand had good lighting, decent image quality but, even with the use of a tripod, had an annoying amount of camera shake during replay of the video. Software was able to correct some, but some remained as well.In terms of feel and build the Sony feels just a little heavier with battery, lens, memory card than the comparable setup with the Canon. Some equate weight to quality, but when you are lugging a camera around all day to take pictures sometimes that weight becomes more of a hindrance. Granted, there is not a huge degree of difference here.Battery life is hard to measure. In my totally \"un\"scientific experiment both candles were about equal. It did seem when taking sequence action shots that the Canon died a little more quickly but it was such a negligible difference it shouldn't impact most users.With allt hat said, which one is better? Honestly, I have no idea. They are both (in my opinion) really good entry level cameras. I think it comes down to price and which brand you prefer. At the time of this review the Canon T3 is a little cheaper than the Sony. Keep in mind if you are investing in a camera make sure to price out the lens and accessories you would want as well. In my humble opinion you can't go wrong with either camera. But, if you are looking for a camera that takes good to great video as well, you may be better served going a step up from both of the ones I mentioned in this review.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bepieutifuk", "Author": "Xellion", "ReviewID": "R15W2HKQLRAXCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera!

At first i love its great image quality, no noise in low light. However the shutter botton felt so flimsy. I didn't like its shutter lag.[...] Once auto focus occurs, release time lag is the delay between fully pressing the shutter release and when the camera actually starts taking the picture. Long lag makes it harder to capture fast-moving objects.I don't know if this is because its poor focus performance, in both indoor and outdoor in a sunny day.Some reviwers have also complain about this too. So slow to focus.Battery is smaller than A200 ( which is an entry level camera too). The A200  focused faster than A37. So i was able to take pictures faster than with this one.

This camera is my first real entry into the somewhat overwhelming world of Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras, and certainly an invitation to spend much, much more on accessories and other items that are needed just to get started.  Just to get started with this camera, I wound up ordering a Sony PRO-HG Duo HX 16 GB Memory Stick, and later ordered a Sony Media Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SDHC/SDXC USB Reader/Writer (MRWF3) to use with that just to make it easy to read the memory stick on any computer I wished.  (While my Sony Vaio laptop reads the Sony Memory Stick PRO cards natively, the other PC's in my home don't, so once I gifted my beloved Sony DSC-HX1 (Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1 9.1MP 20x Optical Zoom Digital Camera with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 Inch LCD) camera over to my daughter and gave her the card reader that I had with the same card that had been used with it, I was left needing another reader...)I should note that I really didn't have to buy the Memory Stick PRO Duo card to go with this Alpha A37 as Sony opted to build in support for both SDHC and Memory Stick Pro Duo format.  That seems to be a concession to those among us that decry Sony's \"proprietary\" formats.  Of course Sony's documentation that comes with the camera and/or the marketing materials on the package for the camera seem to strongly suggest/recommend that the Memory Stick Pro Duo card be selected over the SDHC format \"for better performance\" with shooting video and the like.  Whether that is an absolute necessity is something that I think each user would determine, with the likely answer being \"No\" for most users.Beyond the memory stick, there was also the necessity (for me at least) of obtaining a case or camera bag for this piece of expensive electronics.  While I could have obtained a less expensive and more generic, and likely just as useful and protective, camera bag, I opted to go with a Sony LCS-AMA/B Digital SLR Carrying Case for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony LCS-AMA/B Digital SLR Carrying Case for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera), at least initially.  I'll wind up doing a separate review of that item (which I generally like), but will mention a few things here as this seems a good place to discuss accessories for this particular camera.  That bag is nice, but I found myself a bit frustrated with it in that there is not much extra space in that bag.  Once the A37 is inserted in the bag, there's no room for any additional lenses, and the side pockets on that case/bag have very little room within them as well (barely room to store the USB cable that comes with the camera, along with the USB card reader mentioned above).  Sadly there's absolutely no room to store the documentation for the camera there, so if I want to refer back to those materials later, I'm stuck bringing up a copy (if I can find it) of a .pdf on my smart phone or other similar device.  While that works, I kind of like the idea of having the documentation available, especially I am admittedly a total novice at the use of DSLRs.As I circle back to that (my status as a DSLR newbie), I'll clarify a bit and say that I have plenty of experience with nicer point-and-shoot cameras, especially high zoom beasts like the Sony DSC-HX1, or the Nikon Coolpix P100 (Nikon Coolpix P100 10 MP Digital Camera with 26x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)) that Amazon so nicely sold me a few years back.  Add in a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)) and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)) that I had purchased for my then fiance (now wife), and you'd find I can work my way around a nice camera, but again, SLRs, and especially DSLRs are different beasts.Prior to working with those previously mentioned point-and-shoot cameras, the last \"good\" camera (besides a Polaroid Spectra Instant camera) I had was an old 35MM SLR that my father had obtained for me at one of the many yard sales he had gone to.  That camera came into my hands back in 1990's, and was in need of serious cleaning at the point I got it.  It was taken to a camera repair shop and was \"rebuilt\" as best it could be, but it had already suffered some of the effects of its age and neglect, or perhaps the extra lens that I had purchased for it had, but either way, I was left intriqued by the idea of a nice SLR but unwilling to invest the kind of money into my photography habit that owning an SLR would have necessitated at that time.  Here I am, some years later, and I'm finally getting into the hobby a bit more and am really looking forward to using this Sony A37 much, much more in the future, as I definitely will be adding some additional lenses (my Amazon Wishlist is already well stocked with a couple of lenses that I'd like to add soon) to my collection.The 18-55mm lens that this camera comes with is a decent lens, at least for starters, and my initial experience with it fits very nicely with a discussion about DSLRs that has been taking place at one of my favorite internet hang-outs.  There-in, or somewhere mentioned there-in, was a note about how we've progressed fairly well past the times when the \"starter\" lens that was included with DSLRs were quickly cast aside because they weren't that useful.  Apparently, at least according to the well schooled person making the argument, the camera manufacturers have realized they need to package a reasonably useful lens with their entry level offerings.  I think that's a very valid point to make, and am glad to benefit from that thought myself.  Given the cost of some of these lenses (for example, the Sony SAL18250 Alpha DT 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 High Magnification Zoom Lens w/Lens Hood (Sony SAL18250 Alpha DT 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 High Magnification Zoom Lens w/Lens Hood); the Sony DT 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 Aspherical ED Standard Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony DT 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Aspherical ED High Magnification Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera); or the current object of my desires the Sony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Compact Super Telephoto Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Compact Super Telephoto Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera)), it could get expensive rather quickly to be buying a new lens just because you are not thrilled with the lens that the camera came with.Besides the lenses, there are also accessories like flash attachements and the like that should be considered and can add to the expenses (some of those items are also populating my Wish List currently ;-) )  Oh, I shouldn't forget nice books like David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A55/A33 Guide to Digital Photography (David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A55/A33 Guide to Digital Photography), which I hope to see updated for the A37 model as that author's books seem to be very highly regarded.In terms of use of this camera, I had some initial trepidation in getting started with this camera just because it feels like there are so many options, modes, and possible variables that are involved in using this camera to get a good photo.  Once I got past some of my initial confusion of the controls of this camera when compared to the Sony and Nikon point-and-shoot high-zoom cameras that I'd been more used to (for example, where the \"on-off\" switch is on this camera, the point-and-shoot models offer the wide/tall zoom control), I found the use of this very nice camera to be fairly much second nature.  Gently rotate the lens to zoom out/in, and then depending on the settings let the camera do most of the work for me automatically, or rotate the control knob to select another mode that offers the user the kind of control they might be looking for with this type of camera.I've uploaded a sample image that is shown with the maximum zoom when using the 18-55mm lens, as well as the same basic photo without the zoom, just so readers here can compare the image results.  My own opinion is that the image quality in the photos I've been able to take with this camera are very, very nice.  While I'd like to do more side-by-side comparisons of this camera with either of the aforementioned point-and-shoot cameras, until I pick up a few more lenses, I don't think it would be a fair comparison given the zoom range offered by my other available options.  Additionally, I've uploaded some images that show the camera in the aforementioned case, as well as showing the camera with the LCD display on the back shown in various orientations.The Manufacturer's Product description covers all of the technical details of this fine piece of electronics and includes all of the keywords that might be looked for when researching DSLRs.  I don't want to waste the reader's time here with a repeat of those specifications and features.  I would point out one potential missing function that Sony had included in the DSC-HX30v that I had recently reviewed and that is the GPS and Compass feature that helps keep track of where images were captured at.  Honestly, I can't speak to other DSLRs that might include that functionality or how much more expensive it might make a camera, I would just offer the point that it has been a more useful feature to see added to cameras.One final thought here, and that's of the feeling that there will be, sadly for me, times when I won't be able to make use of this nice camera where I wish I could.  Sadly many of the concerts that I like to attend and shoot pictures at disallow the use of \"professional\" style cameras -- a label they loosely define as any camera that offers lenses that can be replaced, e.g., SLR or DSLR type cameras.  That frustrates and saddens me as I'd love to be able to use this camera as an all the time, any where and every where, camera, but instead it seems to be more destined for me to use more for portraits, or perhaps in outings to the zoo or museums (where photography is allowed).Note that I did later purchase one of these (Sony ACC-AMFM11 Accessory Kit (Includes NP-FM500H Rechargeable Battery Pack and LCS-SC11 Case) for the Sony Alpha Digital SLR) bags to use with this camera, rather than the aforementioned case.  I like this case a little better for my uses since it offers the room to carry along an alternate lens and also offers more room for carrying around the battery charger and keeping everything all together.==Updated to add: looking back over the photos my wife and I took with this camera on a trip we took over the past weekend, I'd have to say I was impressed with the Auto Portrait Framing feature.  (See the specifications above for more details)  I took a few photos of my wife and her daughter and someone graciously volunteered to take a picture of all 3 of us as well.  The camera's Auto Portrait Framing feature engaged and with each of the photos we had taken, the camera automatically added an extra photo that framed the primary subjects of those photos.  On a couple of the photos that meant that I was clipped off (cropped) on the side a bit, but still, you could easily see how the camera was applying the logic of figuring out what the subject was and automatically generating a portrait of them to go along with the original shoot.  Very neat.Also updated to add: I see someone else noticed one of the issues that I came to notice, the autofocus feature during video recordings which creates (motor) noise that is picked up by the microphone.  That can be rectified by adding on an external microphone, but that becomes yet another accessory that would have to be added to the list of things to purchase with this camera.  Admittedly, if someone is spending the kind of money that a good DSLR costs, they may not notice that additional cost that much, but it would tend to push me much more in the direction of looking for a nice bundle that included not only the camera and starter lens, but an additional battery, the external microphone, an alternate lens, etc.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera but cannot compete with a true SLR", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2OEA1AI484J41", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the twin lens pack of this camera & was looking forward to giving it a real trial compared with the Canon DSLR's I have always owned.Out of the box the first obvious difference is the size & weight.....it is both smaller & lighter than any of my SLR cameras, but while the build quality is good it does have a slightly \"plastic feel\".It is a quick camera when first switched on & offers a huge array of shooting options, most of which the average user will never even look at.......the majority can be replicated using basic packages on your PC, and you have to remember that if you choose one of the filters on the camera you cannot go back & change it if you don't like the result.......whereas in you do the manipulation of a standard jpeg on you PC you can.In use it is a fairly user friendly camera but being used to DSLR's there are a number of niggles.
