{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kodak Z981", "Author": "Michael J. Mcmorrow", "ReviewID": "R3I4M4AY0AIGTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Z981 for two weeks and I have given it a thorough testing. My son is a professional photographer and he told me that I would be disappointed with this camera. I told him that I would give it a real-world test and, if I was disappointed, I would send it back.First the cons: 1) The On/Off toggle switch is awkwardly placed. It is almost impossible to turn the camera on (or off) without moving (changing) the Mode dial. 2) The battery compartment is easy to open but very difficult to close and lock (I use my car key to slide it). Also, make sure the camera works once you have locked it. For some reason, this seems to be a problem. 3) A hotshoe and tilting view screen would have been nice but I knew from the specs that I would get neither. 4) The zoom on the back of the camera (rather than on the top) is awkward but I will get use to it. 5) I would have gladly paid an extra $50 to have the camera built out of heavy duty plastic.Now the pros: 1) The photo quality is first rate. 2) The zoom is smooth but, keep in mind that in high power, you really need to steady the camera (I use a monopod). 3) The video automatically includes sound (not so with all cameras). 4) The video is very high quality (1280x720) and the optical zoom works in video mode. When playing this video, it fills my entire computer monitor - not just a little window in the middle of the monitor. 5) It uses SD cards. This doesn't sound like much but these are much cheaper than the proprietary cards that some cameras use. 6) It uses AA batteries. Since I travel a lot in the Amazon, built-in (or proprietary) rechargeable batteries are not an option for me. 7) I love having a separate button for all of the different functions. Most cameras have a Function button that you push and then get totally lost in the maze of options, sub-options and sub-sub-options.  8) The price is great. I have never paid less that $600 for a digital camera.Bottom line: Great pictures, great high resolution video, 14mp and 26x zoom. It has some quirks but is a great camera at a great price.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE This Camera!!...", "Author": "Mercedes J.", "ReviewID": "R2VLG3WMH4HF15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only owned Kodak cameras, and the Z981 is an upgrade for me from the Z1485 and the Z712, both of which I loved. What sold me on the Z981 however, was the 26x zoom. My Z712 had a 12x zoom, which was great, and the Z1485 was only a 5x, but it's small and pocket sized...great for throwing in my purse. Now, be advised...I am NOT a professional photographer (or anywhere near one). I am a stay-at-home-mom who has a slight obsession with cameras, but just cannot bring herself to take the SLR plunge. I take daily photos of my son, and of course, family trips/vacations. That said, this camera may be a bit much for your everyday Joe just wanting to take pictures of the family, since this IS pretty large and quite bulky to to carry around once it's in a case...though I certainly don't mind.In my trials with this camera, I have found only a couple things that I'm not completely happy with. That main one is the battery compartment. While easy to open (just slide the tab and it pops open), it's darn near IMPOSSIBLE to close. I have to use a small screwdriver to slide the tab over once the batteries are in place. Also, when taking video, if you zoom in, it takes a few seconds for the focus to right itself, which may not seem like a big deal, but 5 seconds can be a long time on a short video clip.As for everything else...I'm thrilled. While the on/off switch may be in an awkward place for some people, it's located in the same spot on the Z712, so I was already used to that. All the dial settings are very easy to use, and when you switch to each one, there's a brief explanation on what conditions you would use that particular setting for. Of course, my favorite is the 'Children playing in sunlight' setting. I can take crisp, clear pics of my boy while he's running around, and not have to worry about them being blurry, or dark. Also, (and one of the most important things, at least for me), the click-to-capture speed is VERY fast. When I push that button, it takes the picture...and I can take multiple pictures, one right after the other, with no delay.The Share feature is also very neat. I'll admit, I'm still getting comfortable with using the App, but it's coming a little easier to me now. You'll have to download the Share App to your computer if you wish to use this feature. It'll take about 10 minutes to set it up. I think the main reason I love Kodak so much is their user friendly approach to picture taking...it's why they're the only brand of camera I've ever used. The Kodak EasyShare program is SIMPLE to use, and a great place to store or alter your pictures. Their cameras (even one as advanced as this particular model) are very easy to get the hang of after a bit of practice. If you're at all interested in this camera, I say go for it. I'm VERY pleased with mine, however, as I said, it may be a little much for the casual picture taker.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "The upgrade I wanted!", "Author": "Sara-s", "ReviewID": "R3UZ59OWQFDH1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the Kodak Z740 for several years. It is a great camera and it was going to take a lot for me to upgrade. The Z981 has exactly the added features I wanted. It has anti-shake technology, a higher zoom than the Z 740 and still runs on AA batteries. It also takes panoramic pictures, which I really like.It is a little bigger and heaver than my old camera, but ONLY a little. So, even with the zoom lens fully extended, I have no trouble holding it steadily. It is comfortable in my hands and I like the ergonomics. The buttons are easy to press, while I am looking through the viewfinder. Through its entire range, from wide angle, to 26x zoom, its pictures are crisp.Some reviewers have said that the battery door is hard to close. It is a bit difficult, but I am a middle-aged woman and can close it with just my hands. So I do not consider this a problem.It is not hard to start taking good pictures with this camera. But it does quite a lot, so I do recommend reading the extended user manual on line. I took some shots of water drops coming from a garden hose, to test the burst mode. They came out crystal clear.I am very happy with this purchase. I can't wait to get out and do some nature photography.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "It doesn't get much better than this.. AMAZING", "Author": "Joseph Hummrich \"Try to be fair and accurate....", "ReviewID": "RBMBIHNHJKORW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shopping around trying to decide between the Nikon P100 and another Olympus.  I was even considering going DSLR but frankly I don't need another expensive hobby. Let me just say that the Z981 is AWESOME and performs better than I expected. I like to think that I'm very hard on electronics and I won't keep something if I have any issues with it. In fact I'm on my 3rd 2010 TV right now because of various issues I've had with them.  Anyway, we're talking about the camera here: The pictures have beautiful color.  The zoom is unbelievable and the image stabilization is outstanding.  I have an extremely shaky hand and it corrects this for me without a problem. Video quality is fabulous as well but this would be my only complaint... The auto focus motor and zoom motor can be heard fairly well if you're in a normal setting.  I'm not docking the camera any points for this because it's not a video camera.  It's a mega zoom camera and it does that part quite well.  I've heard complaints about the battery compartment but I really don't have any issues with it at all. It's definitely a tight fit but it's not a frustrating fit at all.  The camera can be a tad slow at processing between shots but if you get a faster SDHC card the time is greatly reduced and a joy to work with.  The price can't be touched for what you're getting here and I would have gladly paid the full $329 after using this camera for a week.  Kodak uses .KDC file format for raw and unfortunately I can't find a good windows plugin so I'm forced to use the Easyshare software for RAW images.  That's not a big deal for me because the JPG in full detail is simply amazing.  14mp pictures come in around 7.5mb  compared to 25mb for the raw.  I just don't see how anyone can argue with the quality of the pictures this camera takes and the incredible Zoom functionality.  Even at full zoom you can crop a picture without losing (visible) detail.  I can't say it enough, this camera is incredibly perfect for someone who wants to take amazing pictures without going with a $800 DSLR.  I'd be very curious to see side by side comparison shots with any entry to mid level DSLR vs. this camera because I just can't see it getting much better.  I will be posting user pics later. One of a golf ball up close, a falcon on the light post outside and some flowers.  I almost forgot... The macro and super macro modes are phenomenal.  If you're on the fence, go for it! You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Pictures, Average Engineering, Poor File Protocol", "Author": "Sam \"General Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R3D93ERNLWPXDP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First ImpressionsWhen the camera arrived, I opened it immediately. My general test for items of this ilk is this: can I mostly operate it, i.e., use the basic features, without looking at the manual. The Kodak Z981 is very intuitive and I was snapping, viewing and deleting pictures in a matter of minutes. For me, the camera layout is very logical.I'm a real estate appraiser and I appraise a lot of rural properties, so the high zoom feature is an important consideration. To test this feature, I stepped outside, went to full zoom on a tree 50 yards away, and snapped a picture. The stabilization feature worked great, and in the LCD display I could see the alligator bark features of the ponderosa.Since I was on my way out to drive a few comparables, I decided I would give the camera a field test. Installing the camera strap was not as straightforward, so I tucked my tail between my legs and looked at the manual. After several aborted attempts, (spatial relationships are not my forte) I had the strap and lens cap installed. The manual provides one drawing and virtually no narrative, so for me it was a trial and error process.Out in the field, i.e., the neighborhood, I started photographing homes. At one home the camera would not turn on. However, I'd read a number of reviews and was aware of the battery compartment lock issue. I opened, closed, and relocked the battery door and the camera worked again, and I never had a reoccurrence of this problem.After taking my final photo, the eighth picture, I receive a message that the camera was out of memory. I was aware that the camera has 64 MB of internal memory and uses an SD card for most of the storage. Still, I'd determined that at maximum resolution the internal memory could store about eight pictures. My SD card was shipped separately and did not arrive until the next day.At the office, I downloaded the pictures, inserted them into the report, and compared them with photos from my old Olympus ultra zoom. The appraisal software that I use has an algorithm that pares down the picture's file size for use in the report; otherwise, the file size of the report would be unmanageable. And here's the thing, the Kodak pictures were significantly better, even in the pared down state.For the most part, the only pictures I take are job related, which probably total 7,500 photos a year. While I do a lot of shooting, I'm not a shutterbug. That is, I know nothing about things like picture noise, saturation, and the other arcane words I've read in camera reviews. I only know what I think looks good in my reports, and the Kodak photos look great.What Others SaidA number of reviews have been critical of the camera's plastic construction, layout, the use of AA batteries rather than a more powerful proprietary battery, and the locking feature. Here are my views on these issues:1. Plastic Construction - To me the camera is solid and with its zoom feature is rather weighty. I would hate to have more weight around my neck just to have metal construction.2. Layout - The layout is different than my old camera, still I did not find any feature untenable. In a short period of time, I'm sure anyone can adjust to the layout.3. AA Batteries - I would never own a camera with proprietary batteries. If I forget to recharge my batteries, and midway through an inspection my camera goes dark, I can be up and running again in less than five minutes with off-the-shelf AA backup batteries. One thing I liked a lot is the big LCD display. It helps me frame a so-called \"keeper\" without any subsequent editing. The one thing I noticed is that the big display uses battery power at a much greater rate. There are low-power display options that mitigate this issue somewhat.4. Locking Feature - This complaint is real. In the first hour of use, some minor camera jostling loosened the connection of one or more of the batteries, which caused the camera to turn off. I opened and closed the battery lid and the camera worked again. Many of the electronic miracles that grace our everyday lives have their own special idiosyncrasies. The real question is the frequency of abnormality. If it happens once a month or less, I'd probably put up with it; however, once a week would be completely unacceptable.The difficulty with locking the battery door is also real. It requires some degree of adroitness and strength. I'm very purposeful in determining the way something works best, and I never discovered a technique that would work consistently. This could be a real pain, if one uses a card reader rather then connecting the camera to the computer. This is because the SD card is in the battery compartment.The Deal KillerUltimately, I had to return the camera. I was almost willing to compromise on a number of issues until I discovered Kodak's protocol for numbering the files. The camera starts numbering the files on the SD card from 000_001.jpeg to presumably 999_999.jpeg. Even if the SD card is reformatted, the number continues from the last picture taken. However, after formatting the SD card and/or the internal memory, the picture number displayed on the LCD screen restarts with \"1.\"In short, there is absolutely no correlation between the number displayed on the LCD screen and the number recorded on the SD card, and this absolutely, positively does not work for me; there is no room for compromise here. If I'm out in the desert of Eastern Oregon appraising 160 acres of vacant land, I need a number method of documenting each picture, since one stretch of sagebrush looks about the same as the next.When I discovered the numbering issue, I seriously dug into the manual, since I was sure there was something that I had missed. Next, I contacted technical support somewhere in the Middle East, and after some discussion in making sure the tech person understood the issue, I was put on hold while he kibitzed with his supervisor. When he came back on the line, he assured me that this is how the camera works, and there is no way to change it.As an explanation, he said it was designed this way so that it is impossible to write over a previously downloaded picture. It was in a tone like he was almost warning me of this peril. Since there were the typical language problems of understanding each other, I decided to not discuss separate file folders and subdirectories.I noticed that Kodak has designed a lot of features that assist one with file sharing, tagging, transferring, etc. for the cyber-challenged. I work with a lot of seniors on computer issues, and I think their major weakness is file management. So for this type of user, the camera file system is a good feature. It's just too bad that Kodak didn't provide other options. I'm now considering the Olympus SP-590UZ. Since the act of looking for a camera, computer, cell phone, etc. is the fun part, let the games begin.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Takes incredible pictures.", "Author": "Ryan Encarnacion", "ReviewID": "R23CJ9RR18I0Y4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I finally decided to upgrade from our point and shoot camera.  We wanted to get a camera that would take great pictures of our 10 month old son.  We consulted my wife's sister who owns a Nikon D700.  Of course she suggested that we purchase a Nikon D5000, or at least the the D3000.  I am so glad that we purchased this camera which is far less complicated and in my opinion took just as incredible pictures as the more expensive DSLR cameras.We've had the camera for about a week now and have had a chance to load the pictures we took from our trip to Vegas onto our computer.  Boy are the pics STUNNING.  We were able to take over 900 pictures on a 8 GB HC memory card(which also includes more than a few videos).  The pics on the computer come out in 420 dpi and  the clarity is jut amazing.  Portrait pics of my son (especially the ones taken in black & white) come out looking like they were taken by a professional photographer (something we could not get from our point and shoot).  The batteries lasted us the whole weekend, and when they finally did need to be recharged, it only took about an hour to get a full charge.We absolutely love the high-speed burst feature.  We used the feature while taken pics of the Fountains at the Bellagio.  It's fun to hold down the left or right button while viewing taken pics on the 3 inch lcd, it almost looked like we were watching a slow motion video of the fountains.  Even though it was night time, the pictures still came out incredible (again something you can't get on a point and shoot)There are a lot more options I have to play with to familiarize myself more with the camera.  Like any guy, I have not read the manual at all yet.  This speaks volumes for this camera.  Its easy to take amazing pictures without having to take classes or read an outrages manual.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is wanting to take better pictures without having to spend an entire paycheck to do so.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fascinating Beautiful Pictures!", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R2KAZ80NJRR6LX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a photography person...but after buying this camera, I might become one!My photography-taking ability has always been limited to taking pictures of my cats or myself for facebook. I am not an authority on cameras at all.However, I am a beginner and if you look at the pictures I uploaded here you will see just what a complete novice can do with this camera!The specs sounded very good to me and camera-people I know seemed impressed so I was willing to spend (for me) a hefty amount for this beauty. I tested it out at night (as soon as I got it) and was genuinely amazed at the quality of the pictures.So lets start with the negatives:- Kodak does not seem to be very interested in teaching their customers how to actually use their products! The little book that comes with it basically identifies all the little buttons but in no way tells you how to use them, how to combine them or what picture quality will come from said combinations or uses. It focuses mostly on the Sharing ability (which for me is useless...I will not blindly upload my entire inventory of photos onto facebook. I prefer to view, study and select them myself thank you)- The extended guide online is mostly more of the same. I was hoping for a \"if you do this you will get this picture\" etc. Unfortunately the guide merely describes some technical specs about each feature but unless you know what those specs mean - its not very helpful. There is even an interactive guide...that repeats the same info but does not tell you what to do with that information.- The link given in the book also takes you to Kodak's general search forum and you then have to search for your camera's stuff which is not very clear.- When you plug the camera into your computer it obsessively wants you to sign up for the share option. It doesn't give you the option to opt out. You have to manually close it out each time which annoys me. I like that you are so excited about your addons...but I should be able to choose it myself.The Camera itself:- The negative things so far seem to be the sophistication of the camera itself. It is easy to get lost in the features. I stumbled upon the pictures I took while flipping through options until I got it right. It is very learn-as-you-go.- I wish it would be more clear how fast the shutter speed/flash is with different options. Sometimes the shutter speed is wicked fast and sometimes it takes a moment while the camera focuses. It just depends on what function you take the picture in.- When it comes out of the box it has a stupid little noise for every action. You can turn them all off.- If you are not used to this level of detail you may get a rude awakening the first time you do a self-pic. Oy. I had no idea. Remember...this camera picks up EVERY DETAIL...the fuzziness of older/cheaper cameras may have been a blessing in disguise for some of us. Just sayin.Negative things other reviewers have said:- \"Its too hard to close the battery case.\" Its a tad tough...not difficult. I honestly don't know what all the kvetching is about. It closes tight - which is a positive.- \"The picture review takes too long in between pictures.\" The camera has several fast-picture options if you are trying to capture several things at once - otherwise the time lag isn't noticeable. If you touch any button on the camera it immediately returns to the picture-taking mode so if you push the shutter down slightly it will set up instantly for the next picture.- \"Its too noisy when it focuses.\" I didn't notice that at all.- \"The on-off button is too close to the select button.\" This is just silly. I have big hands and you just have to be paying attention. If you do happen to move the circle - just put it back.Positives:- Amazingly clear and sharp pictures. When it focuses the pictures come out with details I never noticed on the item itself. I blows my mind everytime I get a good a picture just how fantastic it is. It almost cheapens all the picture art I see because now I can reproduce all of it!- While it takes some figuring out, once you get the button pattern down it is amazing how quickly you can go from taking a sky shot to capturing the tip of a small flower.- The flash at night makes it look like mid-day. Everything shows up with no color distortion.- The design allows you to securely feel the camera while aiming at things. It doesn't feel like its about to slip from your hands.- The shutter speed is so helpful. While reading reviews I kept scanning for this detail. Every other camera I have ever had took like 30 seconds to take a picture and my cats would always move by the time I got it to take. This camera really snaps quickly. Even when it lags due to focusing in some of the modes it is still very fast. Also if you click the shutter several times it will queue it up and take them immediately after.- It really feels like there are a million things to do with this camera and I love exploring the options. It really is not limited at all.Tip- Turn it to macro (the little flower button) while in the M mode (on the wheel) and pour some water on a small plant and get in close...its breathtaking.I am a big fan of detailed pictures of small things. I love shadows and angles and I always hated that my other cameras limited this. I really feel like this camera opens up doors to what I can now do.The price is unbeatable.

I haven't used it much yet, but so far I love it! The zoom is fantastic and so is the flash.I zoomed into a table in a room that was 20 feet away and dark. The flash lit the entire image and worked great!FROM 20 FEET AWAY!Image stabilization is great and so is image quality. I am very happy with the speed of the camera. Much faster than the z612 and I really like to burst feature (1 per second or 8 per second (might be 9 there)).No problems with the battery compartment opening. It is tight, but do you want it too loose?They seemed to have dumbed down settings on this camera also. Only those that effect the mode for shooting you are in are available to change. So in automatic mode very limited settings for the camera are accessible, but in other modes you can access quality and more.Two things I don't like: 1. I had to print the \"real\" manual from a download. I want a small manual from kodak to keep with me in case I have to look something up. They have an onboard help system, but I want a manual.Also, the on/off switch is very close to the mode dial.

I read in a review somewhere else that one user thought that the camera color was over saturated. Saturation is adjustable on this camera, but here's the neat part, and you have to have been shooting kodak film for a long time to appreciate this, but I pulled out some old Kodachrome transparencies from the good ole days and the color saturation of thia camera reminds me of the results you would get from kodachrome. Awesome!!! You have to be old school to appreciate this perhaps, but keep in mind their are two saturation settings on this camera.What I don't like is the need to manually switch the camera from horizonal to vertical. A proximity sensor would have been nice. Forgetting this issue has cost me some shots I really hate I missed. I also agree with the people who don't like the location and for me, the function of the power switch. It should be easier to reach and on should be on and off should be off. There was plenty of room to do this.I do like the feel of the camera with the vertical grip. This camera is a keeper and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a super camera.

I am very happy with this camera.  As with any change from one brand and model to another, I had to acclimate to the location of controls, experiment with exposure options, etc.  Well worth it.Kodak has placed the functions you use most often in actually taking photographs right under your fingertip with a toggle button.  NO NEED TO HUNT THROUGH MENUS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHERE THEY HID THE THING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.I have put the extra grip on the camera and I highly recommend using it since it INCREASES STABILITY and makes it easier to avoid moving the camera when you push the shutter button.It might be nice to have a screen that you can tilt - However, it's one less thing to break when I am photographing while dog walking, and the price of the camera is so good that I'll put up with missing a couple of luxuries.I am not a kid and have some odd vision problems - I was concerned about the lack of a diopter adjustment on the viewfinder. I can take my glasses off and use the viewfinder with no problem at all.  Don't ask me why or how. I don't know, but I think you don't need the diopter adjustment on this camera.  My last camera had a diopter adjustment which had to be adjusted properly for me to see.No way to attach filters - you can hold a polarizer if you need it.  The color intensity is good without it.  Sometimes I want to penetrate water surfaces for images. I thought this would bother me a lot more than it is.The viewfinder is good, and I have found it helps holding the camera steady to use the viewfinder for wildlife shots - not always my choice, but sometimes.I am learning to love this camera - The design of the dials, toggle switch, and menus is enabling me to enjoy photography as I did when I was using 35 mm and had a camera with controls under your fingertips.  For the first time since I have switched to digital photography, I can concentrate on the photography instead of concentrating on manipulating menus looking for settings.No need to carry the manual with you to find stuff.  Shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual are all easy to use - especially easy due to the toggle switch. You might want to read a couple of photo books if you are a novice to gain information to enable you to use these areas effectively.  I don't mean the camera operation.  I mean the knowledge of photography principles to enable you to use the many capabilities this camera offers.Kodak has left off a hot shoe - However the camera's flash is reasonably powerful for most stuff, and while a hot shoe would be nice, you can put a flash on a bracket which you can adapt to trigger when your flash fires. I actually have another camera with the dedicated larger flash, and I found that I rarely use it - a change from 35 mm when I used the larger dedicated flash a lot.  It's often easier to adjust the camera to use available light.Things are well placed, the camera is working well - the convenience of the controls is exceptional.  The price is excellent.  The good zoom with no extra lenses and attachments is a major convenience.A little practice to become accustomed to a different camera than I was using, a lot of fun, some very good pictures (I do a lot of wildlife and nature stuff) - the manual focus works well when you need it.  You need to check your photo style to pick your metering preference - A change in metering preference can affect your results.  I only use the continuous auto-focus rarely - mostly that is a battery hog and a distraction.There is minimal lag time between photo capture and shutter release, which is a great benefit in getting the shot you thought you saw -If you are a raw novice, there is a \"simple\" button.  The camera will evaluate the scene and set itself.  You can start right off with that setting without knowing much and learn as you go how to use the other capabilities available.I love this camera and highly recommend it to anyone considering it, beginner or advanced.  While it may not have every base covered for filters and flash add-ons, the price of this very versatile camera is pretty attractive, too.  It has amazing flexibility for the price, and since I am retired and on a fixed income, price is important - especially in this economy.

I loved the Z981 - until it broke in July.I turned it on and it came up with the message \"Lens Obstructed. Remove Lens Cap.\" The lens cap was not on. The lens never extended at all. After a few seconds, the camera shut off by itself. I tried this several times, but each time was the same. I changed the batteries to fully charged ones in case they were low, but still the same message came up. The camera was never dropped or had never gotten wet so there was no reason for its malfunction. I sent it to be repaired and when it first came back from being repaired, it worked.It broke again in October. Same problem. I was very frustrated and felt like I could not depend on this camera. I asked for my money back or a new camera. Then to add to insult, customer service informed me that Kodak does NOT give a money-back guarantee or does NOT issue a new camera (only a refurbished one) when their product does not work! So... as per instruction by Kodak, I sent it in to another repair center to be repaired.When I got it back, it worked for a few pictures and then in November, it broke AGAIN! I am SICK of this camera and I am SICK of Kodak. I will NEVER buy another product from them. Not just because of the poor quality of the Z981 camera, but because of Kodak's lack of money-back guarantee.I am now having to send my camera back into Kodak at my cost again to be replaced by a USED camera. How bad is that? I bought a NEW camera and expected it to work. Now I have to settle for a USED camera.

So here is the latest and greatest point and shoot Kodak for half what I originally paid for the old DX. I bought it, used it at the wedding and it was better than the old DX, but not so much better as to use it for that again.  So, I am sending it back.  Is is it worth the money? Yes.  Is it a reliable camera?  Yes.  Does it take great photos?  Yes. For me it worked better without the Smart Capture.  In Smart Capture mode, it took great shots, BUT I missed the perfect moment waiting for it to make up its mind.  I tried pre setting the camera by holding the shutter release half way down to lock the settings, but even doing this, the wait time was long enough to miss the moment.  Placing the camera on Sport mode took the Smart Capture out of play and allowed me to get my timing back. Even without the Smart Capture, it DID take excellent photos.

I am a recreational camera user, so for me the Z981 is a perfect step up.I didn't want to invest in an SLR, but I wanted to capture quality close-up shots and be able to really focus on the subject.  This camera does that perfectly.  The 26x optical zoom is incredible and continues to impress the SLR users among my friends and family.  The image stabilizer makes a difference too, especially when using the zoom.The preset modes are decent, although I tend to keep mine set on aperture priority (thanks to a friend who showed me that's the setting for the look I want).  The action mode is a favorite and I can't wait to try the burst - once I figure it out.Most aspects of the camera meet or exceed my expectations, but I will share a few items that didn't quite measure up:1.  The Extended User Guide is not overly helpful for the recreational camera user.  It offers brief outlines on how to use a feature, but for example I still can't figure out the burst mode.2.  There doesn't seem to be a setting to turn off the picture review.  The Extended User Guide says you can turn it off.  It even illustrates the menu and where to find it, but it doesn't exist in my camera.  I have noticed a few other online posts about this same issue so I don't think it is \"user error.\" It's going to require a call to tech support.3.  The lens cap doesn't have a snug fit.

The optics seem very good and it has some great features, not least of which is the massive zoom. But the motor for the zoom is clearly heard on videos and there does not seem to be a way to make it zoom slowly enough. That may be something you can change, but if so I haven't yet figured out how, and I find it extremely annoying. It practically negates the ability to shoot in HD if the zoom cannot be well controlled and the motor sound picks up on the video. Clearly my chief complaints are on the video side, so if you have no intention of using it to shoot video, the value of this camera is raised considerably. Certainly getting a 14mp camera with nice optics and a 26x zoom for under $200 is a solid value today. I do note that one of the tags for this camera is \"1080p.\" It does NOT shoot 1080p video: just 720p. That's fine for me, but if you want 1080p, this is not your camera.

Therefore a Lens makes or breaks a camera performance.Schneider-Kreuznach is one of Germany's best lens' manufactured...ever!  Some of Kodak's camera's are okay with their own brand Kodak lens, but the Schneider Kreuznach lens takes this camera (and a few of Kodak's previous cameras) to a whole new level of photo & video capture.  I originally was exposed to the Schneider Kreuznach Varigon in my Kodak C875 camera quite a few years ago. This same C875 (8MP & 5X zoom, 37-185 mm) is STILL in demand at multiple refurbished or used conditions across the websites I travel. WHY? Because of the lens!  Shall I say it again? Because of the lens.  Now, to this Z981 camera. I upgraded to this Kodak camera, to upgrade to a more SLR (mimicking the professional type of dismantled camera--lens interchangeable) type and because of the fabulous lens.

To turn on the alternate button is a simple flick of a switch on top of camera...there is button you can utilize to change your camera from regular/landscape photos to sideways/portrait layout photo taking.--There is an included screw on wide platform to sit attach under camera which makes for a great hand hold on for those Portrait type shooting situations when the camera is used on it's side (as described above in 2 shutter release buttons).--It also has a RARELY offered VIEWFINDER (electronic type), which saves batteries...as having the 3\"LCD screen 'on' all the time eats more battery juice.--The light is closed unless needed and pops open when needed so is a good protection idea.--The built in \"themes\" are EASY pre-programed scenes (\"SCN\" on the top dial) for the adventurous that want to get specific about a photo but people not tuned in or trained to using manual settings, you can choose from everything pre-program SCENE shot: FIREWORKS, CANDLELIGHT, MUSEUM, STAGE (no flash), FLOWERS (micro=closeup); PORTRAIT, NIGHT PORTRAIT, BACKLIGHT, SELF, SPORT/CHILDREN (fast 0.2 shutter), BEACH, SNOW, LANDSCAPE, & DOCUMENT (some of these require a stable surface or mini tripod=can be bought online.)--64MB of INTERNAL storage capacity (double of anything out there as mostly there is smaller of 16-32MB of internal storage), so should your removeable SD-HC card be full & you forgot a backup...you can still get those shots. Also HD or High Definition 16:9 ratio capable for viewing High Def  of your photos on your big 50\" plasma or LCD TV screen.>>>My only gripe here is that Kodak has not made a camera dock for this camera yet. Which would be fabulous to set camera into dock hooked to big flat screen and use a remote to work on photos for cropping or improved lighting or zoom into a section of a photo to create a detail photo and with as the camera has a CCD image sensor has a resolution 14MP or megapixels that is 4368 X 3256 pixels!  (Just to note HD video viewing is 720mp.)--This camera would be great for those sport events and concerts when you are in the \"cheap seats\" or \"nose bleed section\".  You could get the nose hairs of your favorite singer...well, if you wanted their nose hairs.  Hmmm, well, maybe should not go there.--You can always take a frame from the HD video to print out as a photo as well. The pixels would support this. Sometimes people try to use their flash to capture a performer from too far out, as the flash only works within a very limited space (maybe 10-50 feet). Try using zoom in video and since it is a series of frames, certainly one will have a reasonable or desired frame for making a print.  This Z981 camera came out in January 2010.  I recommend this camera even as a simple point & shoot because Kodak Easyshare has always made them that way.Listed at Kodak for almost $300 this camera is offered at Amazon for around 200 or less and some accessories packaged for 250.

Kodak put together a bunch of presets for a variety of situations that can be selected on the fly by simply pushing a button.

The battery door is quite hard to close, you need to apply quite a bit of pressure to close and lock it. but, is that really a bad thing? The preview cant be turned off which gives the illusion that you have to wait 5 - 6 seconds between pictures but actually pressing the shutter button stops it from displaying and you can take many pictures in rapid succession, I have done it.The Zoom is very quick and takes some getting used to.

My pictures however are on par with most who are using much and I mean MUCH more expensive equipment. In the end I dicided that if I were to purchase all of the SLR lenses I would need to do everything this camera does I would have at least $2000 ivested in my camera and would probably still not be shooting better pictures. True there are advantages to going with an SLR, but for a casual photographer like myself this camera is everything I need. I have only been out shooting a couple of times so far but I have been nothing but impressed by this camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor face tones, too red", "Author": "Bernie D.

Wee \"esotericon\"", "ReviewID": "R7VVV0XK29DRS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After seeing the 26x optical zoom prior to this camera's release, I was anxious to buy it.  I have owned perhaps 12 digital cameras in the past 10 years of all stripes and manufacture.  One of the best is a prior Kodak point-and-shoot because of its excellent optics.  The optics provided with this Kodak product are equally good and you won't be disappointed.  Kodak, however, seems to have taken many shortcuts in the design of this camera.  1.  No hotshoe!  This omission, which is significant for a semi-pro photog is not permissible for a camera that retails for more than $300.  I have bought cameras for less than $200 that have hot shoes.  This means you are confined to the use of the built-in flash--no good!  2.  Poorly placed on/off switch.  3.  To change the battery or the flash card, you must remove the vertical grip--a nuisance at the very least!  4.  Filter--yes, but, what size?  Even the skimpy instructions don't list a filter size.  From the diameter of the lens it's going to be an odd size.  The printed instructions refer you to the Kodak web site for \"expanded\" instructions.  These don't list the filter size either!  It's unfortunate that Kodak's once-excellent design has become so poor.  This is a camera you will regret buying!  This is a 6/5/2010 addition to my earlier review.  Alas, I have to downgrade my review of this camera.  If I could, I would give it a \"0\" not any higher.  The camera suffers from color fringing.  It's not like the \"halo\" color fringing I've seen on film cameras, which has usually been caused by the lens.  This has color fringing in stripes of purple, making it unacceptable.  Unfortunately, I can't return it to the seller now, but it will go to Kodak under warranty.  I suspect this may be a design flaw that can't be fixed.  Woe is me!  You've been warned!  In addition, it has a VERY slow buffer and frequently wants to write to the buffer.  It also hesitates with its \"auto-focus detection\" and can take several seconds before it will let you take a photo.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy way to great photos", "Author": "Diana Ruddick \"dianakate\"", "ReviewID": "R1JTZANID9Z7Q2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A couple of years ago I bought a Kodak pocket-sized EasyShare camera, and was absolutely thrilled by the picture quality compared to the other similar digitals I'd bought over the years.

Drake", "ReviewID": "R13TXMZ896KNQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera specifically to take hiking in Utah in areas with ancient Native American (Ancestral Puebloan/Anasazi) cliff dwellings, some of which can only be seen at a distance. Its telephoto lens is what most attracted me to it.One reviewer, an accomplished photographer, determined that it was hard to get quality prints with this camera. Simplifying his recommendations a little, when he used the \"P\" [Program] setting and \"raw\" picture quality (resulting in unprocessed image data, which he would process later), and an ISO of 64 (preferably) or 100, he got his best photos. His assessment of the \"fine\" picture quality setting was that it was not that fine, hence he went for \"raw.\" He also used \"exposure compensation\" to adjust brightness. Because of his review, when I was in Utah, I often took photos with the \"Auto\" setting (which defaults to the \"standard\" picture quality - although apparently I had it set to \"fine\" most of the time without realizing it) as well as the \"P\" setting so I could compare them later. Because I don't trust myself with processing image data, when I used \"P\", I selected \"Fine\" for the picture quality rather than \"raw.\" At first, I tried to select 64 or 100 ISO, but I did not always have enough light to do that, and/or I needed a tripod (which I didn't have) to allow for a slower shutter speed without blurring, so I ended up letting the camera chose the ISO, which was not as low as the reviewer recommended. I did not fool with the exposure compensation. I used 14 megapixels for the best quality prints (menu button>capture>picture size>14MP).Most of the time (not always), pictures taken in Auto had a little richer (better) color than those taken in \"P.\" Sometimes (infrequently) Auto would distort the color, making tan sandstone more pinkish. When I printed my pictures at home (Canon iP3600 printer, Canon software program - from Amazon), and I made 8\" x 10\" prints of both Auto and \"P\" pictures, to the naked eye, both types of prints were comparable and very good quality. Even using a magnifier, I could not notice a difference in them. I could not say one type of prints was better than the other. In the end, I was very pleased with the picture quality of all of my pictures, and I don't think the average person would have any problem with them as 8\" x 10\"s. Perhaps if larger prints were made, I had used all of the photographer/reviewer's recommendations, or I had a discerning eye of a professional photographer, a difference in quality would be apparent??? (You would want a low ISO, and to uses a tripod, for quality large prints.)When taking distance shots, with trees, etc., in the foreground, the auto focus was a problem. It tended to focus on the closer object(s) rather than the distant subject that I wanted to be in focus. (I did not get into using manual focus, but doing so might have solved this problem.)Because of concerns raised by reviewers about camera movement when the telephoto is extended, I took one reviewer's advice and got a monopod, and a \"ball head\" for shifting the camera's angle easily. A problem I found was that the ball head was apparently made for tripods with different size threads and would not screw onto the monopod. I tried a second \"ball head\" as well as a different monopod and had the same result. (On Amazon, for a few dollars you can buy a 1/4\" to 3/8\" converter which might have solved my problem.) Finally I bought a Canon monopod that came with a ball head attached (Canon Monopod 500 through Amazon), which worked well. In the \"field,\" however, while the monopod kept the camera steadier than were I just standing and holding the camera, with higher magnification, there was still camera movement, especially with a little wind. What I really needed was a tripod (with a ball head). I found that if I was able to sit down, with my feet on the ground and knees up, and my elbows on my knees, I could hold the camera pretty steady - not as steady as would be the case with a tripod, but steadier than with the monopod. Whenever possible, this is what I did for distance shots, and it was sufficient. It was rare that any of my many distance shots were a little blurred (including ones taken with the monopod).I used rechargeable batteries, both the Kodak ones that came with the camera and another brand that also made a 15 min. charger, which I purchased. The 15 min. charger seemed to work better, in terms of how long the battery lasted between charges, than the charger that came with the camera. A set of batteries lasted one day (taking a lot of pictures - 150+) to three days. I like that I can use regular AA batteries (or rechargeable batteries) so I don't have to worry about a not being able to use the camera once a special (non standard) rechargeable battery goes dead.This camera is amazing in low light situations when not using the flash. I like that it is easy to turn the flash on or off. I also like that the camera takes SD or SDHC memory cards and does not just rely on internal memory. (I tend to use a 4GB SDHC card, which works well. I have read that it can take a little longer for the camera to function with cards with a high GB capacity but I do not know how true that is or what GB is ideal for camera functioning. It will take up to a 32 GB card.) I appreciate that one can easily switch from the electronic view finder to LCD screen and that the LCD screen is pretty large (3\"). (I usually used the viewfinder when taking pictures.) I was relieved that all or almost all of what I saw in the viewfinder/LCD screen seemed to appear on the printed photo, in other words little or nothing was lost on the edges. It is also easy to review pictures and to delete ones you don't want.Since the camera is a little slower in functioning than some other cameras, it might not be the best for action photos. (One professional review described it as having a 3.6 sec. shot-to-shot time.)For far away and close up shots, the lens is remarkable. Sometimes stopping the telephoto where you want it would be challenging (it moves through its range pretty quickly) but this was not a significant problem.Opening and closing the little door for the batteries can be a little hard, but I don't consider that a big deal. Using the silver button shutter release when taking vertical shots was a little difficult, and its use made it harder to keep the camera steady. When you are about to turn the camera on, remove the lens cover first, otherwise it will have to warn you the lens cover is on and it takes longer to turn the camera on.Overall, this is a very good camera that is lightweight for its size and relatively inexpensive. If you want a camera with an amazing telephoto, and very adequate picture quality for the non-professional, this one is a very good choice.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Fun Camera", "Author": "D. Beatty \"otowi\"", "ReviewID": "R2O3UQT1NQRQDT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Z981 since November 2010, so on the order of a year and a half.  I have used it several times a month primarily for outdoor photography while hiking/birding.  I wear it over my shoulder so it is ready to shoot when needed.1.  It is not a rapid shooter, and now and then the little bit of a delay between clicking and getting the shot or getting to the next shot is problematic trying to photograph wildlife.  There is, however, a setting where you can have it take 8 rapid shots with each click.2.  It does best, in my opinion, at vistas - fantastic scenery photos.  Low light combined with far-off objects is hard for this camera - sometimes you can get the shot but sometimes not.3.  It does a good job for my birding - but many birds, being a bit far off, are not quite as crisp as I'd like - but I'm not about to buy a $1000 camera to fix that.  I think this camera does as well as the top-of-the-line point and shoots, and for less money.4.  I love that it uses AA batteries - and they last forever.  I can go months and thousands of photos without having to recharge if the batteries are new.  When the batteries are getting old, they will still last a full day unless they need to be replaced.5.  The auto function often provides the best pictures.  I also like the sports/motion setting.  The macro setting often does no better than auto at close-ups, at least in my experience, but I'm not an expert user, either.  I like that auto function is often best, because I like simple and don't really want to fiddle with settings a lot to get good shots, especially of birds and wildlife - they won't wait.6.  I never use the viewfinder because I like the screen, but it is available.7.  I rarely use video - I did record some fireworks once and it did fine at that, including sound. Another great use I've found for the video is for recording sounds - sometimes I can hear a bird but not see it, and I can record this and then take it home to figure out what bird I was hearing.8.  I do not really find any of the buttons awkwardly placed nor have troubles with the battery compartment that some mentioned.9.  The zoom is one of my favorite features - I have used this camera so many times to take a picture of something far-off that binoculars couldn't quite discern, and then went home on the computer to figure out what we were looking at - spotted lots of wildlife this way.10.  I use iPhoto so I don't use the Kodak software, but all works smoothly.11.  This camera does not have special photo editing like black and white,  fishbowl, etc., but I can do that on the computer if I want it.12.  It is easy to shut off the flash, and I tend to do that a lot.13.  This does not have the panorama setting that you just move the camera and it makes it - you have to take two or three shots, and I've not been very good at lining things up right, so they don't always come out the best.14.  The timer works well.13.  I was able to get impressive photos of two lunar eclipses with this camera - but it did take several shots and different settings and then weeding through.  I never used a tripod and even on high zoom I can get great photos.To me the biggest strengths of this camera are:long battery lifegreat zoomworks well on zoom even without a tripodgreat priceI think for less money, you get pretty much as good as the high-end Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic point and shoots.  Maybe a few features aren't there, but most people don't use all those features anyway.The only things I would improve if I could:I like to keep the lens cap off when I'm hiking with it and I wish there were a more convenient way to store it while still attached to the camera - it is tied on but can make noise tapping the camera when I move.I wish I could have pictures as crisp as the professionals without spending that much money.  I do get some that are very nearly that good, but I want even more. :)I wish I could have all that in a camera that would easily slide into my pocket or purse.  This camera you only have with you when intending to use a camera; it would be nice if it were one you could easily always have with you in a purse or glove box but it is just a little large for that.I bought a Canon point and shoot that was smaller but newer and had similar zoom - photo quality between the two cameras is similar, but the Kodak is easier to use and I prefer it.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good features,bad pictures", "Author": "Sunset", "ReviewID": "R3A7YOBOQ94PXI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this camera about a year.

I've owned and used several 35mm, medium format, and large format cameras; had a dedicated darkroom; studied photography for decades; photographed all over the world.  I started using digital cameras when a 3MP sensor was considered huge, and digital software editing has been a passion since the early Photoshop days.  I understand the interrelationships between ASA/ISO, f-stop/aperture, and shutter speed settings and their effects on exposure.  (If you're new to these concepts, you'll probably want to skip to another review.)  The Z981 was hardly a step up for me.  I admit I got suckered in by the price, the 26x zoom and its famous German manufacturer, the EVF, the RAW feature, the large LCD, and the 14 megapixels.  It looks like a semi-professional camera, but it isn't.  It's not a complete dog, although I thought I heard it bark a few times.  In 'Smart Capture' mode (the red one on the dial) the camera sets itself based on what Kodak's engineers thought America's snapshot tastes would be, and you have no control over anything except the zoom.  It will choose an ISO for you, as well as shutter speed, aperture, flash, and then use in-camera JPG compression and noise reduction.  That can be very bad if you care at all about picture quality, but if you're only looking for a small print or web image, it'll do fine.  (I recommend keeping the flash turned off unless you're sure you want it, and then only for fill.)  'Smart Capture' means you don't have the option of thought, and the Z981's brain is very, very small....  It's a better idea to leave the camera set on 'P' and the ISO at 100 so you can get a quick snap with a reasonably accurate exposure, but then, after you get the record shot, take the time to get a better one with M or A.  For even halfway-serious still photography, always use M (Manual), A (Aperture Priority) or P (Program) mode.  'Scene' mode is just as locked down as Smart Capture-- the camera sets all the parameters for each type of scene you select, but it does save you time if you need to get a quick shot.  You might not like the results a lot, but at least you'll get the shot....  In Manual mode, you control the exposure with shutter speed, f-stop, and ISO settings (duh!).  In Aperture Priority mode, you set the f-stop, exposure compensation, and ISO and the camera chooses the shutter speed.  In Program mode, you choose the ISO and exposure compensation and the camera picks shutter speed and f-stop.  Be very aware that the maximum range of available f-stops/apertures is only from 2.8 to 8.0 (three stops or EV's); there is barely a one-stop range at full zoom extension!  With these ludicrous limitations, you should never use Shutter Priority with the Z981--- use the Sports/Action setting if you need to stop movement.  (For some reason, the Kodak Extended user guide shows an aperture setting of f14 on page 20; I could never get past f8.)  Forget \"depth of field\"!  The Z981 has no threads on the end of its lens for adding filters or additional lenses.  If you want to add to it that way, you'll have to buy something that clamps around the outside of the lens or rig it up yourself with velcro or duct tape. ;-)  At 40mm, it's weird that they didn't bother to thread that portion of the lens; once tooled up, it wouldn't have cost them anything.  I didn't test the Panorama setting because of its low 3MP resolution-- I advise taking several shots on a tripod with about a 30% overlap and putting them together afterwards in software rather than using the in-camera method.  I didn't test the high-speed burst feature for the same reason, and 'normal' burst doesn't work in RAW.  It's amazing that still cameras will do video at all, much less the quality of HD that this one is capable of.  A few caveats about it, though: Don't expect great sound through that tiny mic; the motorized zoom is too fast for a usable video effect, and there's no manual zoom; pick a white balance setting-- don't use 'Auto'; and, lastly, you have only two choices in quality--1280x720 and 640x480 (both at 30fps).  It's still pretty impressive.  I didn't try any of the \"social networking\" settings; I don't like Kodak's intrusive software and I don't need it to know how to email photos.  The 'Keyword Tag' function labels a series of pictures (it doesn't work in RAW), but the label you create won't be displayed by any software except (buried) in a Windows Explorer 'Properties' submenu and Kodak's annoying proprietary software; it would have been truly helpful for it to have been contained in the EXIF or IPTC headers with the rest of the exposure info--  there are empty slots in both....  Other reviewers have found that the Z981's numbering system is so useless that they've returned the camera; the system doesn't seem that bad to me.  Use a small pocket notebook while you're shooting.  (Before digital, you had to use a notebook.)  Changing the numbers to whatever you want in a good photo organizer is simple, too.  It's not the easiest system, but it's certainly logical.  You've got the date and time, the shot numbers in series, the ISO, shutter speed, f-stop, exposure compensation, use of flash, compression, contrast, color and sharpness settings-- and you're complaining??  RAW/KDC in the Z981: The 'Fine' JPG compression isn't fine-- images are blotchy and pasty-looking when examined closely at all.  Judging by comparison with the results of third-party software, noise reduction is automatically added along with JPG compression.  That means there is really no other choice but RAW if you care about the quality of the results.  Using third-party software to make JPG's is the way to go: With only 2% compression in PSPX4, I was able to shrink a RAW/KDC file from 25 MB down to 12MB with no noticeable image degradation, even at pixellated magnifications.  Even a 10% compression ratio still looked good, and gave about a 4MB file size.  Bracketing your exposures has to be done manually in RAW; the auto-bracketing function in the Z981 doesn't work on that setting.  Oddly, the Color, Contrast, and Sharpness settings all affect the RAW image-- you can actually take a sepia or black-and-white photo in RAW!  Go figure.  There is no real manual focus-- AF and motorized focus (MF) only.  The AF got totally confused by a dark red car at full (and almost full) zoom as well as a distant landscape shot at full zoom; it was unable to focus correctly at either of the three AF settings (multi-zone, center-zone and selectable-zone).  The camera focused perfectly on a tree at the same distance/zoom settings as the car with no problem, however.  Manual Focus (really manually-controlled motorized focus) has enough detents to get reasonably close to sharp when the AF fails  The image is automatically double-sized in the EVF or LCD while you're actually using MF, but it shuts off quickly when you stop adjusting the focus.  Moving the camera slightly towards or away from the subject after MF has done its best will get fine focus-- if your eyes are sharp.  The Super Macro setting allows a distance of 4/10ths of an inch from the front of the lens to the subject!  I couldn't get that close without getting in my own light (you'd have to use side-lighting to get that close) but even within an inch or so of the subject the autofocus worked perfectly.  It's a good thing, too, because the MF setting is pre-empted by the Super-Macro.  ISO settings: The image deteriorates very quickly as numbers go up, and it's noticeable as early as ISO 100, though only by direct comparison with ISO 64.  Highest is ISO 1600 in Smart Capture and RAW, five stops above the best/slowest; 3200 and 6400 are available in other settings, but only at 3MP resolution.  (I'd have to be really desperate for a record shot to use either of those.) The mottling  at 1600 is actually rather cool looking, like grain in very fast film, but it wouldn't be so cool on a face.  Since there are so ridiculously few f-stops in the lens, I had hoped that the adjustable ISO might give more shutter-speed options.  However, I tried to shoot a sunset at ISO 400 and the results were unusable-- the clouds were filled with dots and specks.  Even ISO 200 has easily noticeable degradation.  Better not use an ISO faster than 100 with any large smooth areas; I plan to stick with 64.  Software with noise reduction might help some after the fact.  There's no way to adjust noise reduction on-camera; it is what it is.  That's also true with image stabilization-- I couldn't test how well it works since it can't be turned off and on, but it seemed to work fine.  My Z981 sucks the juice.  After only ten RAW exposures the newly charged AA batteries were down 3/4 in the EVF display-- and I didn't use the LCD.  To be fair, I was shooting outdoors at about 30 degrees F.  However, even under normal temperature conditions, battery drain occurred quickly: After only twenty-five JPG shots and a bit of futzing with the menus, the battery meter showed the level below half.  Take extras.  The battery door is a bit hard to open and close, but it just takes a little concentration, not muscle power.  A minor annoyance.  Also, turn the camera upside down before you open it (duh)!  It keeps the batteries from falling out.The bottom line with any camera is picture quality.  Some truly great photos are possible with the Z981 if you:  1) expose at minus 2/3 EV when shooting in direct sunlight; 2) carry extra batteries; 3) watch out for the imprecise AF function; 4) use only ISO 64 or 100; 5) shoot only RAW; and 6) crop the blurry edges out of your telephoto shots (with all those pixels you'll still have plenty of detail left).  That's a lot of ifs, though.  The end of all this is that the Kodak Z981 is not a semi-professional-grade still camera, though it looks like it's trying to be one.  Digital noise shouldn't be discernible at ISO 100.  Forget the 14 MP hype-- it doesn't matter how many pixels there are if the image is noisy.  Not being able to stop down past f8 can be a serious annoyance when you really want some depth of field, too.  The camera has a very long zoom lens, but blurriness on the edges from mid to long telephoto and an easily confused AF lower its attractiveness; it's good for snapshots and HD videos, though.  For serious still photography, however, ISO 64 or 100 and RAW are your only usable choices.  That means carrying a tripod, but you should anyway.You can get some amazing shots out of the Z981, but you'll have to work within its shortcomings.Pluses:1) Records good HD video2) Has an EVF and a large, bright LCD3) Amazing zoom and macro range4) Low chromatic aberration5) High quality images possible at ISO 64 and 1006) Uses AA batteries instead of proprietaries7) Low price-- you still get a lot, even with the minuses8) Has the usual tricks for photo manipulation, from face recognition and scene presets to black and white and sepia imaging9) A decent 'point and shoot' snapshot camera, except for its sizeMinuses:1) Digital noise gets pretty bad by ISO 2002) Blurred edges from mid to max zoom3) Only 3 f-stops at best, 1.3 at worst4) Little depth of field5) Battery life is short6) AF issues-- sometimes it can't focus7) Even 'Fine' JPG compression looks bad-- at all ISO's8) No real manual focus, and the motorized manual focus is not easy to use9) No thread to mount filters, etc.10) Rather useless 'Keyword Tag' function11) Too large for a point and shoot/pocket camera", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Initial impressions", "Author": "Nick McTavish", "ReviewID": "R3MEFFJRCFJE70", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this less than a day ago, so my use hasn't been exhaustive, but so far I'm impressed.When I read the camera took AA batteries, I assumed they wouldn't be included, especially since I bought a refurb camera.

I needed a replacement for my old Lumix and since my wife had previously owned a Kodak digital camera which took great photos, I decided to try this camera.  I was impressed with the specs but was particularly interested in the fact that it was capable of taking HD video.  In fact, all the promos for this camera exalted this capability.  I take a lot of video with my camcorder and was hoping that the Kodak would serve double duty for me.Well, the camera does take wonderful pictures.  Colors are true and color saturation decent.  The auto-focus works very well but it's a little noisy (more on this later).  I've got some great framed enlargements of shots that were taken with this camera.  The on/off switch is a little awkward but the exposure and shutter speed controls are easy to use.  As a still camera it is wonderful.  I am a little annoyed by the fact, though, that no matter how long I charge the batteries, the battery indicator never shows them to be more than about half-charged.Now, as far as the HD video is concerned:  It does not matter at all that the video LOOKS very good.  The fact is: any video that you take with this camera will be ruined by the noise from the auto-focus mechanism.  This constant clicking noise is picked up in the audio by the camera's microphone.  The first time that I viewed video taken with this camera I thought that I had accidentally recorded my neighbor practicing on his drum set (I mean this literally.  It was that bad.)I contacted Kodak support about this.  I was instructed to test the camera by shutting off the continuous auto-focus mode.  The noise ceased when I did this.  Here is their response to that:\"Anyhow, setting the video AF control to Single AF is just a way to check if the clicking sound is caused by the lens optics in motion as the camera continuously focuses. If the clicking sound disappears after setting the video AF control to Single AF, then the clicking sound is caused by the lens optics in motion which is normal.\"When I told them that this noise could in no way be considered NORMAL they told me that I could send the camera to their repair facility, which I did.  The camera was sent back to me with no change in its function.  I then contacted Kodak's customer service dept.  Deborah A. ShurynSenior Customer Relations Specialist asked me to send her the camera so that she could \"personally evaluate the camera to determine the best path forward.\"  I sent her my camera.  Here is her response:\"The evaluation of your camera has been completed by the Kodak Service Engineering Department.  After extensive testing they have determined that the noise you are hearing is the result of the lens focusing mechanism.  As I'm sure you noticed; this is most prominent when using auto-focus as the lens is constantly moving to retain the focus. While I deeply regret that you have found this noise to be so frustrating, there is, unfortunately, nothing we can do to eliminate it.  The same would be true with any other manufacturer's digital camera. The microphones are actually quite sensitive and pick up sound from all sources, including the lens mechanism.  As nothing can be done to remedy this situation, I will return your camera to you.\"This claim that \"any other manufacturer's\" camera would be the same is total nonsense.  Try, for example, the Nikon Coolpix P100 (which, by the way, takes 1080p HD video).  The video is perfect. How anyone can try to say that it is normal for a feature that they prominently tout in their ads to be ruined by a design flaw is ridiculous.  I guess Mz. Shuryn believes me to be some sort of idiot that will be content with her nonsense.

I read most of the reviews on the Z981 and purchased it in Nov. so I could use it over Christmas and New year Holidays. I received the camera in about four days. I usually use normal shipping. I was supprised that the charger came with the unit. I like the idea of AA batteries if your in a spot you can usually find them anyplace. The ZD8612 we have, uses a special battery and is rather pricy. The two concerns that the people were writing about were the location of the on/off switch and the battery door locking. First is the on/off switch. The ZD8612 swith is in the same location and doesn't seem to pose a problem. I have big fingers and I can operate the switch with no problem without hitting the mode dial. The battery compartment door is a different animal. You need some strenght of close and lock the door. I can close mine by pinching the top and bottom together, then activate the lock. My wife uses the camera also and I ended up cutting a piece of an old mouse pad ablut 2x3 inches long. Then she can place the pad on a table edge and then set the camera upside down on the pad then close the door and secure the lock.As far as the camera operation. The pictures I've taken so far have been really nice. The zoom operates very smooth and the wide angle is suprising. The battery life seems normal. I would recommend purchasing this comera.

This camera appeared to be a great deal on paper, so I bought it.Once I opened the camera and started using it, the first thing I noticed was that the LCD screen is really grainy.  This makes it very difficult to evaluate picture quality in-camera.  Basically you don't know what you're getting until you put it on the computer.The biggest and most irreconcilable flaw this camera had in my view was that the picture quality was well below what I expected, and significantly worse than my 6 year old sony 7.2 mp point and shoot.  The images were mediocre at best and only if you didn't plan to crop anything.  Every detail is fuzzy when you crop/zoom in.  I tried messing around with the settings, flash, iso, shutter speed, and taking some pictures in natural light outside to see what the thing could do, but it was still unacceptable to me and still worse than my old sony.Because of this, I ended up returning this camera, and bought a canon sx130 from Best Buy.  So far I am very pleased with that camera.  It may just have been my camera that had a bad lens, because I couldn't even get up to the level of quality that I saw on various albums and reviews on Flickr and Cnet.

Navarro", "ReviewID": "R39XUL106PTP47", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a mom with 3 kids, ages 6, 4, and 2 and I did NOT like this camera.  I really wanted to like it and forced myself to keep using it, but within a week I had to give up and admit that it just won't work for me.  Here are my problems with it:1. Too delicate for kids to ever use.  It may be bad, but I will often let my 6 yr old and sometimes even my 4 yr old use the camera to take a picture.  Otherwise I'd almost never have pictures of my husband and I together.  Just the size of this will make it harder for them to hold, but the biggest thing is the pop-up flash.  It feels pretty flimsy and if it was ever accidentally dropped or bumped or something I'm afraid it would break right off.  Now that I've realized how dangerous that could be, I'll be sure to avoid any camera with a pop-up flash (plus they supposedly put them that way to keep them farther away from the lens which will reduce red eye, but I still got red eye in almost every picture).2. Horrible red-eye reduction tool.  Speaking of red eye, the red-eye reduction tool on this camera is HORRIBLE!  If your camera is set to red-eye reduction, then every time you push the button to take a picture, there's a small flash (which makes everyone think it took a picture and they can move) and then about a full second later your camera does a bigger flash and actually takes the picture.  I'm sure adults are smart enough to stand still and keep smiling until the 2nd flash if you tell them to, but not kids.  Especially if you're just trying to catch them in the act and you need to take a fast picture.  What's even worse is that as soon as you push the button your LCD screen goes black and stays black until the picture is taken so you have to try really hard not to move your camera because you can't see what's happening for the next second.  I got lots of pictures where I'd accidentally moved it a little and part of a face was cut off because I couldn't see what I was pointing at.  This is especially true when you're zooming in and even the slightest movement is a big deal.3. Noise.  I never paid too much attention when people talked about noise in the past.  From what I'd seen, it seemed like almost any camera over $100 will be pretty much noise free under normal circumstances to the average user.  Anybody complaining about noise was probably way more of a heavy-duty photographer than I was.  Well, this camera was an upgrade from an 8MP Canon PowerShot A630 which I LOVED (but it finally broke).  When I tried zooming in on my son's eyelashes in one picture (on my computer), I was shocked to see tons of tiny little black dots all over his face!  I know it was zoomed in a lot and if printed to a 4x6 it wouldn't be noticeable, but just in case I ever wanted to blow up a picture, that really bothered me a lot.  I pulled up an almost identical picture taken with my Canon and there was NOTHING like that!  His skin in that one looked perfect.  I know ISO has a lot to do with noise, but this was on the automatic setting (I think 100?) with pretty good natural light (inside the house, but it was a sunny day with lots of sunlight in the room).  I started comparing other similar pictures between the two cameras (like pictures of my daughter jumping off her bunkbed and catching her mid-drop) and it was easy to notice a lot more noise in the pictures from this camera.  The clarity just wasn't there as much.4. Shutter lag.  I know it says online you can take pictures in .02 seconds or something crazy like that, but I could NOT for the life of me get that to work!  I put it on the children mode, which is supposedly the fastest, and turned off that ridiculous red-eye reduction \"tool\", but when I was using flash it still took about 3 seconds for me to get a picture.  It seemed quite a big slower than my Canon at getting the automatic focus set so I could push the button down the rest of the way.5. Compulsory Flash not reliable.  This one was so weird but it kept doing it!  Even when I'm outside in daylight I often like to use a flash to help with shadows and stuff, so I almost always have my flash set to compulsory (where it always goes off no matter what).  But in spite of that, it seemed like almost 1/3 of the time the flash just wouldn't work!  It was especially bad if I would be holding the button down half-way for a while before I actually took the picture.  I do this a lot, though, with my kids, because I want to get the camera set up so that as soon as they're making that perfect face or doing that thing they were doing I can just hit the button and get the picture right away.  If I would hold it for, say 5 seconds, before I took the picture, the flash almost never worked.  So frustrating!  So they're finally smiling great but the picture is dark or kind of blurry because there wasn't flash.  I don't know what the deal was with that but it did it everyday and in all different lighting settings, etc.6. Focusing in video mode.  With my old camera, I would sometimes get frustrated while taking movies because it would focus when I started taking the movie, say while my child was 5 feet away, but then if they got really close to the camera it would be noticeably out of focus.  After using this camera, however, I realized I would much rather have that problem and remember to stay generally the same distance away for the whole movie (a change of a couple of feet in either direction was fine, just nothing major) than the way this camera does the auto-focus.  I took a movie of my daughter singing and sort of dancing in place but she was dancing side to side with her feet she sang and it kept getting a little bit blurry while it tried to focus on her new position with every slight movement! It was horrible!  At one point she walked about 2 or 3 feet closer to me and that time it really seemed to take a while where it was really blurry for like 2 or 3 seconds before she got back in focus up closer.  It's so distracting to the movie!  I don't like that at all!  The sound of the movies was good, though, and it's awesome having it in HD.7. Zoom is too fast/choppy for movies.  I'm sure when a camera has such a big zoom like this one, they have to make it capable of going fast, but unfortunately there isn't a way to hold the button more gently and make it go slow.  For pictures it's great to be able to zoom in and out so fast, but it's not a good thing with movies.  Everyone knows what it's like to watch a movie with super fast zooming in and out, and with this camera you can't avoid it!  I just tried to never use the zoom in my movies because it was almost never worth having it be so jolty like that.8. Huge files.  I know this is 14MP camera and maybe I'll just have to get used to this, but my jpeg images were 5 MP each!  When you sometimes take 1000 pictures in a month, that takes up a lot of hard drive space!  Since I like my pictures from my 8MP Canon better than these, I'm not so convinced that more megapixels means better pictures.9. Lens Cap. A couple of times when I grabbed the camera fast to take a picture of something cute a kid was doing, I was in such a hurry that I kept forgetting to take off the lens cap first.  If you do that, it pops up a message about being unable to open because of the lens cap and it takes almost 10 seconds AFTER you take the cap off for it to realize it's gone and be ready for you to take a picture.  SO frustrating!THE GOODBatteries. It comes with rechargeable batteries and a battery charger, which was a nice and unexpected bonus.The zoom/flash.  Having that zoom was SO fun and I couldn't believe how well it worked!  I was playing around with it a lot and I'd take pictures of things 20 feet away in a very poorly lit room and they would be perfectly in focus and lit up to where you'd think I was holding the camera right in front of it on a sunny day!  (okay, maybe a little noise and graininess, but mostly just on the ones with REALLY bad lighting.  If the lighting was okay they really did look amazingly clear and well lit.) That was very impressive.  After having it, though, I was sad to realize it isn't really something I'll get much use out of when I'm mostly just taking pictures of my kids.  When you're zoomed in that far away you have to be taking a picture of something that isn't moving very much or it'll take too long to find it again and wait for it to focus in time for taking the picture.  Kids are almost never holding still that long, plus how often are you 20 feet away from your child while taking a picture?  Maybe in a school play, but definitely not at home, the backyard, or especially the zoo or Disneyland or anything. =)  While very cool and fun, having this camera made me realize a super-zoom just isn't a very practical selling point in my situation.  I'm going back to something in more of the point and shoot category that I'll be able to have with me in my purse all the time without being so bulky like this one.  I've ordered the Canon PowerShot SD780 IS which sort of feels like I'm going in the complete opposite direction, but that's kind of what having this camera for a week has done to me. =)  Note: after having my new one for about 3 weeks, I LOVE it!!!", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "\"Average\" bridge camera at best..........", "Author": "freestyleFrEaK", "ReviewID": "R14KPG2AJ2TIHI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me first state I've tried a pretty good handful of megazoom bridge cameras over the last year.  These include the Canon SX20is, the Canon SX30is, Fuji HS10, Nikon P100, and now the Kodak Z981, so I have a pretty good comparison base.I'd like to also state I own a little Kodak Z915 pocket cam I like to carry around to catch candid moments without the fear of having more expensive equipment damaged or stolen.  After taking the Z981 for a 3 day run, I have to say, I prefer my little Z915 to the bigger and badder Z981.  Why?  It's simple, better image quality.  The Z981 touts a 14 MP 26X zoom lens in contrast to the 10 MP 10X zoom in the Z915.  Comparing pics taken with both cameras of the same subjects, it's quite evident the Z915 image quality (color and detail) beats out the rather soft, off-color and slightly unclear images produced by the Z981.  At 26X optical zoom, the images aren't any better than the Z981 at 10X optical cropped and re-sized. Even at a great price point, I was expecting a little more from the Z981.  Anything at a greater than 26X zoom (digital) presents a difficult situation trying capture objects in the photo frame. The image stabilization is rather shaky (reminds me a lot like the Nikon P100) and the auto focus can be confused and slow when trying to capture moving subjects.  Many times, the focus seems to be confused between objects and focuses in and out which at times seems like forever.  When it comes to IS (image stabilization) the Canon products win hands down, imo.Now I can talk about the other little things I liked and didn't like, but the bottom line is the Kodak Z981 produces, at best, mediocre to average image quality, imo.  If a camera can't produce great photos, it defeats it's existence.Even with it's great low price all I keep thinking of is a quote I read from someone else regarding this camera, \"It's as if Kodak produced the Z981 as a afterthought in it's camera line-up\".After trying the Z981 and returning it, I really do agree with that statement.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "buena camara", "Author": "gustavo", "ReviewID": "R35TTGKTB0731A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es una excelente camara. sobre todo el barrido panoramico.

I love Kodak's quality. I purchased this camera to replace my Kodak Z8612IS which was stolen. I loved that camera also except it didn't have a view finder. So when I had to replace it I decided to upgrade to the Z981 with the view finder and 26X zoom. This camera is GREAT. I attend many racing events and it is difficult to take pictures of fast moving cars. With this camera I have the opition of taking 8 pictures per second or 9 when the shutter button is pressed. Or I can just video a few laps and make still pictures from the video right on the camera.With most of my pictures being outside having a view finder is a real plus and it saves battery life. LED screens don't do well in the bright sun. The pictures on this LED are visable outside and to some degree in direct bright sun.I was at the Nascar night race in Bristol TN this year and had seats way up just under the sky box. I was able to zoom to the other side of the track and read the writing on the pit stalls. I even took video with the 26X zoom and cut pictures from it. At the highest zoom you do have to hold the camera steady but it will automaticaly adjust the focus if you move. I tend to not be steady when I take pictures but this has not been a problem with this camera. I haven't taken any blurs.It came with 4 rechargeable AA batteries and the charger. They take about 18 hours to charge. I purchased 4 extra. I found that the battery life is pretty long. Less if you take a lot of video. The camera takes HD videos. I found that when I tried to download the pictures and video to my computer it wouldn't work through my 2.0 USB. I bought a 4.0 cable for $3.99 and pluged it into that and it downloads fine. I also had the videos freeze up on the computer. I had some trouble with these things because I have an older computer. If you have a newer computer you should have no problem. Videos play great on the camera.The owners book that comes with the camera does not provide any real info. Just go to Kodak and run off the extended user guide. It gives you all the info on all the features.There are two flaws that I have found with this camera. The battery door is difficult to close and the flap that closes over the memory card has a very thin piece of rubber attaching it to the camera. It appears rather fragile. It may be stronger than it looks. I use caution when opening it. It weighs a little more than my last Kodak but not by much. I can still hold it steady enough for extended periods of time. These are items that I can live with because of how great this camera works. For the price this camera has as many if not more features than a $700 camera and takes very good pictures.

The camera has a top notch lens, and the 26x \"optical\" zoom can't be beat.  I've owned this camera for about a year now, and I still get compliments on the quality of the pictures.  Since there are already a lot of good reviews on this camera,  I'm just going to add my two-cents worth on some of the features/functions I've seen while using it.First off the camera casing is plastic, but it's nice and solid and doesn't fell cheap and flimsy.  And after have lugged an old film camera around Europe for 5 weeks, having a camera that doesn't feel like you're carrying a brick at the end of the day is nice.  It's true that this isn't a small camera that someone can just drop in their purse, but I don't think it's really meant for that.  This camera can take great quick shots, but has a lot more features that move it into the next tier above just point-and-shoot.There have been some complaints about the battery compartment, and how either the batteries don't get seated right, or how hard it is to close.  I've never had any problems with the battery seating so I can't comment on that, but closing the battery compartment can be a challenge until you figure it out. All you have to do is put one finger on the top of the camera while squeezing the battery cover closed with your thumb.  Then just use your other hand to slide the latch closed.  It requires a little strength to squeeze the cover shut, but not so much that you have to go to the gym and work out first. :-)The on/off switch is probably placed in the wrong location since it's very easy to rotate the function selector knob at the same time you are sliding the switch.  Kodak probably should have reversed the placement of the on/off and portrait/landscape switches since on/off is used more.The function dial makes it easy to switch between the different modes, but is just a bit too sensitive to being turned.  I find that it often turns when I'm putting the camera back in it's bag, so I have to check the setting each time I pull the camera back out.  It's not a big deal, but making the dial a little stiffer would be good.I've tried the video capture feature a few times, and can say it really does do a great job.  It not only captures in HD, but it also captures audio really well.  I took a video at the Monterey Bay Aquarium where there was a \"lot\" of ambient noise, and the microphone picked up everything clearly and could easily be understood on playback.I can't say enough about the 26x optical zoom, which was about the highest zoom factor of any all-in-one camera I could find.  With the high quality lens it really allows you to take very clear zoomed in photos, and the macro function can show amazing details on things like flowers.  Also the zoom toggle switch is placed in a good location for me, which is in the upper  break your budget, but is a step above the usual point-and-shoot cameras, this is definitely one to consider.8/29/13 update:  I've been meaning to update my review with one issue I ran across with the motion stabilization.  The cameras motion stabilization works well when capturing video, but the motor doing the constant adjustments is loud enough to be picked up by the cameras microphone. I haven't found a way to turn the stabilization feature off yet, but it will have to be turned off because the alternative is videos with a lot of annoying noise...", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK Camera", "Author": "Christine Abernathy", "ReviewID": "RZH752C7OFIAD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Quality of pictures are good!

I had the DSLR for sometime and wanted a camera with a nice zoom on it with out paying the great cost for a DSLR lens only. So I got this camera and I love it. The zoom is what got me to look at it but after using it this summer I can say the entire package is pretty good.I took some shoots of kids jumping off the boardwalk into the ocean at the beach one day and the picture of them in mid air and how clear they are is great. And I did this before I found out how to use the burst mode. In addition to the diving shoots I got great pics of a speed boat passing by and a bird in flight.Color was great no motion blur everything seem nicely blanced in the shoot. I then took a video of the group I was with at the beach and was blown away at the quality. No little window playback it was full screen and looked outstanding.The weight of the camera took a bit of getting use to. It is solid built but at the same time a lot ligher then expected. Start up time was ok recovery time was seemed long if you forget that a lite press on the shutter button would clear the display of the picture just taken.Another reason I when for this camera is it has both a nice display screen and an eye piece view finder, a lot of camera in this class I looked at dropped the eye piece view finder.I am no pro I just enjoy taking pictures and if you are like me looking for a really nice camera that will not break the bank uses standard AA battries and is use to using a eye piece view finder I am certain you will enjoy this camera alot.

I usually use my aunt's old Kodak Easyshare Z812IS 8.2 MP camera because the pictures are so gorgeous even in AUTO.  They were true to color.  So I bought this as an upgrade to hers.  I've barely had it a day and here's what I think thus far.  I was a little taken aback by the fact it takes 4 AA batteries (YIKES).  According to the paper that comes with the charger, it takes 16-18 hours to fully charge the batteries.  They're still charging as I type this.The body of the camera is definitely more \"plasticy\" and I would hate to see what would happen if I dropped it.  It is not as heavy duty as the Z812IS.  The strap, as folks mention in their reviews here, is a big ol' pain the bum to put on.  The picture provided in the little manual is pointless to look at really.  After about 10 or 20 minutes I got it.  When you go back to review pictures, zoom in and \"move\" around to look at the picture (whatever that is called), it is slow.Yes, the on/off switch is in such an odd place.  It is right above the dial you turn to change camera modes.  It's as if Kodak put this camera together and \"oh my gosh, we forgot to install the on/off switch.  Quick where do we put it?!?!\" And they put it where, if you have fat fingers, you'll probably turn that dial as you turn the device on or off.  Plus, the zoom button is on the back of the camera and not on the top right corner as some cameras.  Which that is a non-issue to me.That being said, quirks and all, I am still hopeful that I got a good camera. If this 14MP takes as good of pictures as the old 8MP, I'm keeping it.  I'll report back soon after the batteries finish charging and I've taken some photos.UPDATE: I have had this thing for two days.  I've taken about 25 pictures.  I have taken most of them by looking through the viewfinder instead of the display.  Already the battery life is showing half full.  I have barely used it!!! It is loud when trying to focus, which someone else mentioned, when I zoom in to objects like the moon.  The pictures are pretty to me but I am not sure if it's worth losing battery life THAT FAST.  I like to travel and having an extra set of 4 AA batteries to pack around would irritate the pee out of me.  I'll give it a few more days before I make my final decision.

I haven't tried the video yet, but if it's as promising as the still pictures then I think I will have made a great buy.The downsides to this camera is the slow and unsteady zoom rate.  In addition to that, waiting for the focus to lock on is a lot longer than most cameras.  This is definitely a camera that should be used with a tri-pod or for taking stationary shots.

However, I was an early adopter of digital, and before that, 35mmSLR, both of which Kodak didn't offer at the time(s), being a consumer camera niche supplier in the hardware area.  Of course, they continued to be the quality leader in all the film areas, including exotic ones for the pros, and, with family ties, I'd sort of kept an eye on the company's products.Our point-and-shoot (with enhancements mimicking 35MM manual cameras) digital cameras, aside from the very earliest, turned out to be Olympus.  The Kodak offerings during those years weren't either sufficiently geeky, or too expensive, or lacking a viewfinder.However, we live full time on a boat in international waters (read: salt), and our most recent Olympus had not only suffered enough salt air to lose its view screen (the one on the back - the finder was fine) during a wave-watching period; it got drenched when a wave slammed ashore, climbed a 50' rock face, and leapt over the 30 feet we were standing back, hitting our companion hard enough to knock him down, and drench us (along with the camera).We eventually sent that camera off to Olympus, where we were informed it was unrepairable; \"Would you like to buy a refurb with a full new warranty?\"  It was more than I'd expected to pay for a new camera, and, by that time, 2-year-old technology, so I demurred.I'd found several potentials in looking around in anticipation of this day, and Kodak had several possibilities.  I referred them to my professional photographer brother.  He had very nice things to say about this camera, even though it wasn't the current model.  That it's not will make finding one, other than on Amazon, challenging, unfortunately, but one of our must-have's being a viewfinder limited our choices, as the industry is moving away from those in all but the very high-end cameras.More research showed that this camera had all the bells and whistles I'd ever need, and, as you can easily find the specs on the internet, I'll not repeat them here.I've had several weeks to play with our new camera, and am very well pleased.  The ability to use a common SD chip, rather than the somewhat wonky XD Olympus requires, makes retrieval of the images a snap.  We don't shoot in ultra high resolutions, as our usage is to document what we do and experience in our waterborne home, so even a small chip holds more than we'd ever take without unloading it.I find, despite my high speed chip, that images are a bit long to write to file for my preference, but my reading of the specs showed me that a really fast chip wouldn't change that, as the write speeds aren't fast enough to change matters by going to a higher speed chip.  For someone who needs to take pictures in other than a burst speed, but very quickly, this may be a knockout for this model.The flash is automatic - it pops up when needed or specified, with no latching button to release, a very nice feature.Many of the reviews I read complained about the battery door.  Pish-Tosh!  Push down on the outer edge so that the pressure of the battery springs is relieved (hold the camera so that your non-latch-moving hand has the thumb on the top) and the latch moves without effort, whether closing or opening.  Helps to be a physics major in my prior life! :)The camera is physically larger than my prior, but nowhere near the size and weight of the DSLR my brother uses, and only marginally heavier than my prior Olympus, so it's an easy user.Two minor complaints as to familiarity vs most other digital cameras:  The power switch is right in front of the wheel controlling the setting you want to use; it can get bumped into another place while operating it.  The zoom button isn't around the trigger, but on the back of the camera.  The zoom is a matter of familiarity, but the power switch has required extra care - I have to look, and activate, carefully, before I turn it on or off.This camera has a vertical (portrait vs landscape) button, but I've never used it, preferring to turn the camera as I always have.  I presume the button will transform the viewfinder and image 90\u00b0 so that you see (a much smaller, which is why I don't use it) the vertical orientation - which would also save an editing step by having the image presented that way on review.  Some may prefer this option.So far, we've found the battery life to be satisfactory, but then, we never use the viewpane, so save a lot of milliamps that way.  The camera comes with an included charger and 4 Kodak AA NiMH batteries to get you started.  I wasn't able to determine whether the charger was \"smart\" - that is, it cuts off when the batteries are charged, so as to not cook them if left in too long - and the lights don't change character to indicate full charge.  So, I assume you have to be careful as to how long you leave the batteries in it.  It's also not one of their quick-chargers; the appropriate charge time is many hours.All in, I'm a very happy camper (well, boater, if you can call how we cruise as merely \"boating\").  I was offered an all-perils extended warranty, administered through Amazon, and given the environment we're in, took it.  I got a followup call from the warranty company in a few days wanting to make sure I was happy.  That's pretty unusual customer service.  The way it's registered is also unique in my experience (maybe living offshore has limited my exposure and it's now the norm?); one merely tied the digital receipt from Amazon to them, and it's done. Pretty simple, I'd say.  Dropping, water, and other hazards are covered, so we're very glad of that, given our relatively hazardous marine environment.Thumbs up for me on this camera!", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak Messed Up On This One", "Author": "Lisa P.

It is bigger in size which was a bit awkward for me at first.  i do love the bigger screen on the back.  I took this on our family vacation last week to Wash DC.  I have not yet received back my developed pics but here is what I can say so far - my outdoor pics on a clear sunny day came out great.  Inside photos or low light, definitely look more grainy.  The zoom is awesome.  Love it.  The battery compartment door is hard to close.  I have learned not to use the little \"notch\" in the slide, just push the whole slide while holding down the door and it seems to close easier.  It is a pain though.  Looking through the viewfinder is not super clear, which I experienced with my previous Kodak camera as well. The on/off button is a little odd to me, I probably like the one on the old camera better. This one you push to the side and let go to turn it on.  The old one you pushed over and it stayed there.  I also don't like the battery charger it came with.  My camera was not showing the batteries fully charged after I tried it on the charger it came with and my other charger.  I noticed at some point during the day, it was showing full charge so I am not sure what is up with that. The first time I really used the camera was inside in the school gym at an awards ceremony and those pics came out disappointing at best.  The inside lighting and far zoom did not work well together.  Closer photos inside seem to be fine.  I actually really regretted keeping it for awhile after seeing those initial photos.  After the vacation, I am glad I have it and can't wait to see the printed photos.  For most of what I take pics of (family photos inside and out), I think (and hope) that this camera will be fine.  If they don't come out as expected, I will update review.

I am upgrading from the kodak z1012 and kodak z1015 cameras.  The issues that others mentioned about the difficulty of opening the battery compartment and hard to access on/off switch were not problems for me.Pro's:  Nice feel to the camera.  26x zoom is terrific.  Non-proprietary aa batteries rechargeable or alkaline.  Very intuitive to use...I didn't find the owners manual in the box until I had been using the camera for several hours.  Good picture quality indoors and outdoors.Con's:  Like others have noted, the included Kodak battery charger is a joke.  Buy a \"smart\" charger along with a 2nd set of batteries.  The camera has a hard time focusing at maximum zoom on close objects.  There is no option other than to view each photo after it is taken...not convenient when trying to take multiple pictures.  The review function does not interfere with the \"burst\" mode though.

The only thing I don't like is the inability to put filters on the camera. I bought an extension that allows me to put 72mm filters on, buts it's only good at full zoom. Anything less and you have to use the full size 14mp and then crop the shots (you get that annoying rounded edge where the lens sees the extension), so you really can't use a polarizing or uv filter; seeing as how most of my shots are out a windshield or side window at 50+ mph, I get reflections. It does help to make sure I focus past the windshield or window and that does eliminate some of the reflections.As far as regular picture taking, inside under fluorescent lights,outside in either sun or shade, you simply can't been the color or sharpness of the pictures. that is my personal opinion. I got (at a family picnic at a local park in a shelter and outside) 853 6.5 mp pics and 8 minutes of hi def video on 4 batteries and a 4gb sd card. I still had room on the card and the batteries only showed half down.I use the Kodak batteries that came with and have a spare set of energizers(all re-chargeable). I also have a spare 4gb card and an image safe. So far I have had this camera about two and a half months and have taken about 6000 photos and 30-45 minutes of video. I have never run out of card room or battery life.It is NOT a dslr. I do not expect the results of a dslr, but I don't have to carry all the equipment either and have taken some damn fine photos. I would definitely recommend this camera.Update after comment...12/25/2011Okay so I screwed the pooch, I forgot I had set this camera for the picnic at 3mp instead of 6...everything else I said goes. 853 pics and 2 vids, one 2.5 mins and one 6 mins on a 4gb card and one set of batteries, and yes I was using the kodaks at the time and am still using them. I will also stack my \"out the window\" shots against anyone's and most of those I take at at least 6mp or higher, depending on where I am going and for how long.

I had no problem opening and closing.  you push down, and then the lever slides right in.  Only negative of battery compartment might be that they located the SD Card insert slot in the battery compartment.  great photos.  I have a three to four year old fujifilm camera.  And also this kodak z981 that I just recently bought.  This kodak has spot-on light metering.  Nice focus, and you're going to get accurate colors.  If you go to sporting events, you might be disappointed.  there seems to be no option for continuous shooting.  The 26X zoom is a great zoom!!!!!  The easy share option I dont really care about.  I just pop my SD card into my computer, to save my photo and video files.  The camera stores video files as \"quick time video\" files.  On my computer, I have a program called youtube downloader.  The youtube downloader program converts my Quick Time video files into Windows video files.  Eventually if I post to youtube, Ill just browse my computer files for the file to upload.  My main priority:  $199 was a great price for a 14MP camera with 26X zoom!  I recommend a good zoom for picture taking. 26X zoom kicks ass over any 10X zoom.  The guy who posted his review right after me says the camera has difficulty focusing at maximum zoom.  I noticed this on a few occasions.  Although one trick:  the camera will refuse to focus until the built-in flash is ready; then after the flash is ready, the auto-focus kicks into gear.  The close-up mode is best for indoor photos, even if you're not doing an extreme close-up.  The close-up mode will use flash.  If you use regular automatic mode instead of close up mode, the camera might over-expose.  A little trial and error is needed to see what modes work best for you.  The different photo modes on this Kodak are not quite what Im used to.  My three year old fujifilm camera has a \"natural light\" mode, and a natural light with flash\" mode.  So far, Im not quite sure what the equivalent modes are, on the kodak.  The \"natural light with flash\" mode on my old camera seemed to offer better color and lighting.  To relate this to the Kodak z981:  There seems to be a rule of thumb with all these auto exposure cameras, that if you use a non-flash mode for indoor camera, the camera decides it has to compensate for lack of flash, and thus gives you shutter and aperatures which over-expose the photo.  My recent photo hobby interest was to get a digital camera to shoot photos at a local antique car museum.  I bought the camera; I shot the photos;  I have no idea what future use Ill get out of the camera.  Point being, I come to realization that my visits to the museum have been at different times of day.  The museum has porthole windows close to the roof, and assorted glass doors at different directions.  The museum building was designed to take advantage of outside light.  Outside light at different times of day might have had some affect on my photos.  To any and all disgruntled purchasers:  there is NO perfect camera!!!!!!!  there is not perfect camera!!!!!!!  One nice advantage of these type of cameras:  great resolution when you do medium to large size photos.  But Im not talking about pixels.  Remember the old newspaper photographers of the 30s and 40s?  they didnt have the same type of cameras that the general public had.  the old newspaper photographers from before WWII had large-format cameras.  Their cameras used large negatives.  You understand what Im saying?  35mm film became the standard film of many amateurs for many years.  It was a smaller format film.  it did not enlarge well.  These digital cameras are not limited by the size of a strip of film.  They take a larger photo.  And If Im not mistaken,  I think the lens on all film cameras was designed to shrink the image down so the image would fit onto the film frame.  but with digital you have no film frame, so you have lens optics that dont have to shrink down the image size.  Perfect example of what Im talking about is photos frames.  The 5 inch and 7 inch photo-frames have very mediocre resolution.  But the same file photos on a computer show up very clear, at much higher resolution.  Its an opposite of film.  whereas film photos get grainy and blurry when you enlarge them,  Digital-camera photos are larger size, and become blurry when shrunk down.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice camara", "Author": "N. keith", "ReviewID": "RG0I0UG09GFMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camara. the zoom is great. and it takes very good pictures.the video feature in nice and if you have a spot in the vedio you realy like you can make a singe picture, or you can make a picture with 9 pains of the video.

I am very disappointed to say the least.  We owned the Z7590 and used it for 4 years with no problems.  One day it quit working, and we could not get it repaired.  It was a pretty durable camera, and withstood a few unfortunate drops- one of them on concrete.  This camera (Z981) would not withstand any drop whatsoever- it is built like a toy.  I don't want a heavy camera hanging on my neck- but I want to know that I have a quality item at a $225 price-tag.  It is actually built like a cheap remote control.Out of the box, it took one picture, then the digital zoom locked at the highest setting, and the camera would not shut off until I pulled the batteries from the pack.

My p850, z712, z1012, z1015 were all good cameras - my favorite is the z1012.  The z981 out performs all the previous models by a comfortable margin and uses AA batteries.  Low light ISO settings are a little better on the z1012 - 3200 at 10mp - the z981 only allows that at a lower resolution.  The white balance is pretty good but be aware there is NO manual setting.  None of these have hot shoes for external flash and flash range is limited.  The burst mode is pretty terrible compared to my Canon S5 which can shoot 800-900 frames in 10 min.  The big problem with the z981 that I got from Kodak was a loose lens suspension.  These have a soft lens suspension to isolate zoom and focus noise from the microphone during movie shooting.  My z1012 is effectively silent in these conditions.  The new z981 lens was sloppy in it's mount and so noisy as to render the camera useless in movie mode.  In all other respects (except as noted above) the z981 kicked a$$.

Big, BIG mistake.I am sending the Z981 back and eating a 20% restock charge (close to $40), and I'm darn glad to pay it to not be saddled with this piece of crap.Whoever designed the battery/memory card access door should never again be allowed within twenty feet of a design computer. It takes both hands to close and lock the thing.  Then, about fifteen minutes into using the camera, it just shut off, and I had to open it up and close and relock it to get the camera working again!  I've never seen anything so poorly designed in my life, but that's the tip of the iceberg.Of the 256 shots I took--I shot the vast majority in either shutter priority or aperature priority mode--I'd guesstimate that one out of five is either out of focus or incorrectly exposed, or both.  Focus is the larger problem...when I could get it to focus.  Quite a few times, and this really applies only to fairly close shots, when I would press the shutter release to set the autofocus, the autofocus would oscillate between too close and too far, passing back and forth through what looked on the screen to be the correct focus point until I'd give up and release the button to try again.  Widening the view usually took care of this, but, as I said, many shots appear out of focus now that I've transferred the files to my computer and have viewed them on the screen.The  Z981 uses four AA batteries, a great improvement over the single proprietary battery in my old Z610.  With the Z610, when I ran out of battery, I was finished shooting, but with this one, I can simply hit a convenience store and be back in business.  Of course, as with just about everything else about this camera, there is a down side.  I could shoot about 400 non-flash images with the Z610; this one was down to an indicated critical low battery level in 256 shots.The Z981 also offers RAW files as well as JPEGs, an improvement over the Z610, but I ended up shooting mostly JPEG's anyway.  When I went with RAW, the camera froze while it processed a shot and I missed a couple follow-up photos as a result.  RAW is better than JPEG, but not if the camera refuses to shoot.To top it off, unlike with my Z610, from which I could simply remove the memory card and stick it in my computer's card reader to transfer files, I had to load a Kodak program onto my computer to get the shots into my computer because my card reader refused to recognize the Z981's memory card.I'm just glad that I can return the camera and this debacle will be only a $40 mistake, rather than a $200 disaster.

I know a few other reviews had said closing the battery compartment was difficult but I didn't find it difficult in the least. It was about as simple as it possibly could be. The exterior of the camera is top quality. It could definitely withstand a few dings and scratches, and I'm definitely not worried about it getting broken. The functions are also very simple to use. It's set up just like my M552 and it has a few other great features too, one being that it can take 10 pictures one after the other at a very rapid speed. Really gives it the feel of a true professional camera. And what I love the most about it is its self timer feature that times in both 10 seconds and 2 seconds.

You can just set it up on a tripod and take all your pictures by yourself without needing an additional person there. My problem with this camera is the quality of the pictures. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE 90% of the time. Maybe I expected too much from this camera, but I'm no professional photographer, so if I was displeased, a professional would be appalled. DO NOT take the pictures without flash. They come out terrible and full of noise. Like the worst I have ever seen from a camera. Definitely worse than any point and shooot pocket camera I've ever had. Also, when there is no flash, the colors are WAY off. I have light brown hair and crystal blue eyes and it makes my hair look fire truck red and my eyes lime green. Horrible. Not to mention the noise is unbelievable. I'd rather the picture be blurry. And outside is another thing. Not nearly as bad, but the quality of pictures doesn't seem to be good unless the lighting is absolutely perfect. Which it isn't most of the time, that's why I bought this camera in the first place. To do what a point and shoot won't. Night pictures are horrible and very low quality.

I would like some way to speak to a representative of Amazon, or at least find out more info about my order, I see these cameras on the shelf of every department store and retail store that carries the Kodak brand of camera so I don't understand why it is taking so long for Amazon to fill my order. I am slowly moving from patiently to irritated...", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worse Easy Share larger size camera Kodak has produced.", "Author": "Camerawoman", "ReviewID": "RANH5GJAW96DG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed in this camera. I have been a big fan of Kodak Easy Share cameras for years and I'm still using my latest of 4 Kodak cameras I've owned, the Z1015 IS, which is a great camera compared to this new model. The Z981 may have their good lens but nothing else can even come close to their Z1015. The body on the Z981 is light weight and very plasticy but I could deal with that if that was the only problem. As mentioned by others the battery charger is cheap and can take up to 12-14 hours to charge the batteries. You have to guess if the batteries are charged since the light stays on. The features on the menu are minimimal and rather basic. The image stabilizer works hard, perhaps too hard, zooming in an out and takes too long to focus especially in longer zoom settings. The focas feature is terrible! Your subject sure needs to be very paitient while you wait for the focus to adjust. Once it does the pictures are nice and sharp. But they do look grainy until the picture is actually taken so in darker lighting it is harder to see your subject. Even at 26X the picture was very sharp and clear. But the time getting to that sharp picture may be daunting to some. The zooming in and out and motor sounds is time consuming and distracting. Red eye can be an issue even with the red eye flash on. The video was clear even on zoom but the sound quality is terribe. And you can hear the motor sound of the zoom on the video. It has a clicking sound. Not very loud but it is audible. The built in software is almost usless. In order to download the pictures to your computer the software must be installed to your computer first via the camera by the USB cord. It isn't their original version software which works very well and has many useful features. This software uses Windows Gallery which is a basic that comes on Windows computers. And basic is what you get! All in all I would not buy this camera. If you want a Kodak camera and can find an older version of the Kodak Z1015IS buy it. It can be used with the Kodak dock which recharges the battery at the same time, has 15X zoom, has many great menu features that the new Z981 doesn't, and is a great camera! I will be taking this new camera back and getting my money back! Kodak please bring back the true Easy Share camera that can be used with the dock, the one I have loved and enjoyed using for years! This new one isn't it! I noticed Kodak is now making a lot more of the smaller pocket sized cameras. Not many cameras in the size of the Z1015 or the Z981 anymore. Kodak, there are still some of us folks out here who want the bigger camera with more features. The price is great for this Z981 but still just not worth it on the long run!", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I am very afraid of buying any electronics from amazon I bought a blackberry cell phone and i last 2 months", "Author": "Babygirl0304", "ReviewID": "R3FRT8ZEFNQR5U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very afraid of buying any electronics from amazon I bought a blackberry torch 9860 and it last only 2 months for mega tel wireless.So i buying my stuff direct from the manufacturers from now too many dealers pulling smart ones on customers so people be careful and Amazon check on the dealers they will make you lose customers.From Trinidad.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad return policy", "Author": "Caroline Farley", "ReviewID": "R2JF2K93B85757", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Make sure you know exactly what you want before ordering from this company.

I did read some reviews about this camera from CNET and other reviews online. This particular camera did not have very good review so my expectation was low to start with. My dad is not into photography so I just wanted him to get started with this camera. So I thought for the money it would be a good buy. But I was wrong. I have Panasonic DMC FZ28 two year old model and picture quality of Kodak is nowhere close to Panasonic.Picture Quality:Fade looking color. Feels like lack contrast. Lens is constantly moving for focus always making some noise. In Panasonic I never noticed this. Time lag between shots are too slow. Worst thing is colors are off. Lack contrast.Feature Set: This camera tries to provide lots of features which is great but because of picture and video quality these features could not satisfy me.Video Quality: Video quality is horrible in this camera. I am not expecting camcorder level video that would be unreal expectation. Compare to my Panasonic, Video colors are off. Lens is adjusting constantly which makes noise. This noise is captured by the microphone for the video and video is ruined with this noise. This is not the worst part yet. Worst part is when you zoom the video, you can actually hear the lens rotors that move. This is very loudly audible in the video. Video is worthless at this point. I also have some simple compact point and shoot cameras which shoot way better videos than this one.I have owned Kodak cameras before. In fact my first digital camera was Kodak and I was very happy with that camera until I lost it one day and had to buy other cameras. With my initial experience, I thought this would meet my expectation. But no, this one was absolute failure.I am planning to buy either Panasonic DMC FZ100 or Canon SX30is. More expensive cameras but picture and video quality will be way better than this one.

Then you have to delete the duplicate that doesn't have a date on it.  The date function is not an option to turn on or off.  To me, they ruin a good camera but the engineers screwed with the date.  You spend more time putting the date on each picture instead of taking them.  Simple design would have been let the user have the option to turn it on or off.
