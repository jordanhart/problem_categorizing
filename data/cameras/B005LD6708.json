At the price these lenses are however, I bought...thinking if they don't perform, I will sell em on E Bay.I like them....and so does my Nikon D5100.The quality is much better than one should ever expect....at much higher prices.I afixed all of them to my kit 18/55, and to a 55/200.....nice fits...all over.The close up kit stacks right and proper.The hood screws firm onto the 55/200...but on the kit 18/55 it fits rather sloppy, I can make do with that; besides I only look at the hood as a bonus.The Q tips, cleaning solution, and cloth....are still packaged, I guess they will work if I get a need for them.I would be remiss if I didn't mention that when I turned the filters onto my lenses, they seemed to emit a faint squeak as the threads engaged. I remedied that by rubbing a very light coat of talcum onto the male thread; they run quite smoothly now.I feel quite satisfied....and recommend this product. The delivery was Very timely.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$24.95", "Features": "The Essentials You Need To Take Full Advantage Of Your New Digital Camera\nHigh Resolution 3PC Filter Kit: Clear Filter (UV), Polarizer Filter (PL), Fluorescent (F-DL)\nLens Hood - Protects your lens and reduces flare.\n52MM Close Up Lens Kit Includes +1 +2 +4 +10\nHard Rubber Lens Hood & Electronics Deluxe Micro Fiber Cleaning Cloth", "Name": "52mm Bundle Lens Accessory Kit For Nikon D3100 D5100 Digital SLR Camera With 18-55mm, 55-200mm Or 50mm Nikon Lenses.
