The S500 produces excellent images, is easy to use, and is compact enough to carry in a pocket.  3X optical zoom is standard on these cameras.  Besides shooting still photos, you can record low-res video clips as well as audio clips, but don't expect high quality on either.For a hundred bux less, you can get the 4MP S410 model which is otherwise identical to the S500.  Should you go for this or the S410?  I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements.  5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot *and* plan to blow up the cropped images.  The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a better value.", "Date": "April 14, 2004"}, {"Title": "E18 Error / problem with the lens", "Author": "Johnathan Parker", "ReviewID": "R3JKGPVYXT19QB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Canon digital elph camera. Both were great cameras. Recently upgraded to the S500. About 6 months later I get the dreaded E18 error. I searched the Internet and found numerous people having problems. When I determined the problem to be the lens not fully extending I decided to give it a tug. It clicked and the camera came on, ready to take pictures. Turning it off and on produced the E18 again. While turning it on I gave it a nice little bump on the side (where the USB connector is) and the lens popped out on its own. No problems since.Its a nice compact and light camera and takes great photos and videos. Only complaint (other than E18) is the limit of 30-second videos on 640x480 mode.

Within 4 months of purchase, my S500 has become unusable. Many people encounter the E18 problem with other Canon cameras - not just the Canon S500.Comments:I've owned five digital cameras since 1996. All continue to work with the exception of the Canon S500.  I have shipped software that works with digital cameras. I know very well how reliable digital cameras are supposed to be. It would be ridiculous for me to claim that every Canon S500 will eventually get this problem.

Excellent, Sharp Pictures in a Small Frame.", "Author": "Bobby Kwan \"office monkey\"", "ReviewID": "RDP9P5GA0UQYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping at Best Buy with my friend, who decided on the SD110, the smallest in the ELPH series.  However, after a little research, I found that the s500 is only marginally larger than its smaller sibling.  Even so, this marvel can slip into my front pocket easily and takes superb pictures.  The s500 also has the distinction of having 5 megapixels--fully 2 more than the SD110, and 1 more than the cheaper s410.  I'm thinking if I'm already going to be spending so much money ($500 with an additional battery pack), I might as well go all out for the best, or just stick to a cheap $200 camera.  Right?  And who wants to buy cheap electronics?  :-PI also have the Canon A70 and the Sony Cybershot U40.  While the A70 was my trusty workhorse last year, it is rather homely and bulky.  While not *very* large, there would have been no way to slip that brick into my pocket, with it's protruding grip and lens.  Also it is only 3.2 megapixels.  From looking at the pictures I took today on the s500's \"shakedown\" around the neighborhood, I can already tell that it takes far more detailed, sharper images than the A70, which suffered from a minor \"softness\" in the pictures it took.  Also, the s500 is less a camera than it is a work of art in it of itself.  When off, the camera has a slim, elegant look.  It has an nostalgic air of Art Deco about it.  From the front, the highly polished silver and handsome gold rings around the lens will catch anybodys' eye immediately--a breathtakingly beautiful machine to take breathtakingly beautiful pictures.On the other hand, this camera is not nearly as small as the Sony U40, which was about the size of my index and middle fingers put together.  However, that had no zoom and took only marginally acceptable images (2 MP and rather grainy)--I bought it primarily so I'd have a throwaround camera.  In any case, the s500 is not *as* small, but it still fits into my pocket without any hassle (you'll know it's there, but it won't bother you), and the optical zoom and high image quality more than make up for it.Again, the image quality is superb, and all in such a portable package.Manual controls are light.  There is AUTO, Manual, Panorama, and Video mode.  In Manual, you can control the ISO and F stops, but they are not readily available, and require fiddling with the menu to access.  I don't care, personally.  I bought the camera for it's portability and ease of use when I want to snap pictures.  I leave the wheel on AUTO and I am perfectly content with the images I get--for the average picture taker, too, I'd imagine.The movie mode is decent.  This is a camera and not a camcorder, it's still part of the package, but I'll not put it into consideration when rating this camera.  Subpar.  My A70 could take 640x480s at 15 frames/second while the s500 only takes a sluggish 10.  It's is quite choppy, but bearable.  The s500 can have 15 frames a second under the two smaller video resolutions, but they still do not look as good as the videos I captured with my A70.  There is just an element of choppiness that I do not like.  Perhaps the increased megapixelage necessitates a decrease in smoothness, I don't know.  However, the movie mode is just an additional nicety in this otherwise superb piece of machinery, and it decent, acceptable, just not as good as I know it could be, for Canons, but I know this feature is important for many people considering digital cameras.The proprietary battery is also something that I do not like (I prefer AAs) but I suppose there have to be some trade-offs--I'd suggest getting a spare, since it's theoretically supposed to last only about 2 hours per charge.  I'd also suggest getting the skin-tight leather cover for this cam, since you can still fit it in your pocket while keeping that lovely luster intact, away from the coarseness of your pockets.I'd also suggest getting a CF that has as high a write speed as possible.  When taking pictures at maximum size(2592x1944) and maximum resolution (super-fine), my card took about 1-3 seconds to finish recording.  I could continue taking more pictures almost immediately afterward, but I would still have to wait for the images to finish writing before turning off the camera.  I did not notice this when I took superfine photos at the Medium size settings.  Speaking of CF, I'd also suggest getting as big a card as possible.  This monster takes pictures at 1-3 Mb each which means about 100-200 picture for me--my 256Mb card doesn't seem so adequate anymore.  But it's fine.Conclusion.So definately a great buy.  It takes wonderful, superb pictures, and decent movies.  By itself, it is a work of art, and truly is a handsome camera.  All this, and is still compact enough to throw in your pocket or for the ladies, purse.  There are slightly smaller and cheaper ELPHs, the sd110 and s410, but you will already be spending so much, and if you are, you might as well spring for the full 5 megapixel goodness that the s500 offers--3 megapixel cameras belong back in 2003.  And there are other brands to choose from, but I honestly have not seen a more handsome camera that takes such spectacular images, and I think if you are considering this camera at such a price, that surely, you will be considering the aesthetic value of what you are buying.

I post my experience on dpreview.com forum, and in one day there was a response from another s500 owner, saying that his first s500 suffered from E18 error after 2 months of use, then he bought another for his trip, then after 7 months it died from the same problem. After intensive search in the internet, I notice that I was not alone. E18 error results from the unreasonable mechanical design of the camera, the lack of lubrication of the metal motor and plastic lense track. After some use, the plastic wears out and the lense fails to retract. What I couldn't believe was that my s500 died from this problem in 30 mins, unbelievalbe.

With any number of slim cases available, the S500 can be worn on your belt very comfortably.  It's not too heavy, and it's small enough that it doesn't get in the way much more than a cell phone, doesn't look like a fanny pack, etc.  If you're considering this camera, size is probably your number one concern, making this a great choice.CONSPictures sometimes come out bright when using the flash.  The brightness isn't bad enough that your pictures won't turn out good, but it is slightly brighter than you might expect (I.e., if you're using another Canon or other digital brand already).  It also looks brighter on the LCD than it does when you view the pictures on a PC.MISC.- At max size and resolution, pictures may be over 3MB in size.  I use a (few) SanDisk 512MB CompactFlash cards (SDCFB-512-A10), which hold around 200 pictures a piece.- Battery life is decent, but you'll probably want a spare if you're going to be on the move all day.  The Canon Digital Elph Camera Accessory Kit includes a battery, mid-size carrying case (great for travel) and a slim belt case.  At ~$60, you can't beat it.- For underwater photography (also good for rain, skiing, etc.), the underwater housing (WP-DC800) works great.

This aspect is particularly infuriating when you are trying to \"capture the moment\".  I've just this minute tried to take a shot of the office I'm sitting in writing this review and I pressed and held shutter release and no shot was taken and no message as to why (just two defiant beeps).  A second press of the button worked, but this dents your confidence in the device.  Other times, the 500 seems to take an age to trigger the shutter (even on the Quick Shot setting).This is now my third model in the range... the 2.1 had faults that I could live with (innaccurate viewfinder, hesitant shutter release) as the design and image quality was superb.  The 400 was a staggering improvement with all of the glitches ironed-out and great resolution.

But that doesn't mean I don't use cameras from other manufacturers.  I have found that Canon cameras, in this case the Powershot S500, are at the top of the camera market.The design is terrific.  Canon really outdid themselves with the design of the Elph line of digitals.  It's good looking and compact, but still packed with all the features you need.

It's a small camera, but some people are surprised at how solid it feels.Included with this camera is a high speed 32mb compact flash card.  They're the first to include a card of this type and size which is great.  But if you're shooting at maximum resolution, you can really only take 11 pictures.

The low light assist lamp works well.

I've used several different digital cameras, and this is definitely the best(Olympus C-765, Pentax Optio S4, several Olympus Camedias). That being said, I have a few complaints:Flash - Indoor scenes often have too little light to take a picture without a flash, but regardless of how little light there is inside, a flash will always make the pictures look incredibly washed out at ranges closer than about eight feet or so. More than ten feet will result in a blurred, low quality image that really doesn't benefit at all from the flash. So, for low lighting, get a tripod-- and get a decent tripod, too, the cheap ones are really unstable.Batteries - Third party batteries cost me something like $5, and they work for maybe three recharges-- so do NOT buy one of these. The OEM batteries are exorbitant, though.Lens size - A tiny lens means a tiny camera, but it also means a camera that can't take pictures that require a lot of light-- you either use a flash(losing color quality), or take a very blurred picture. For some reason, as well, low-lighting conditions often result in bizarre white balance. Indoor pictures always seem too orange, however I set it...Additional praise:Focus - Generally works out to be perfect or near-perfect.Movie Mode - I don't expect it to be like a professional video camera, but for what it is, it works quite well. The microphone's easily twice as good as iPod mics I've used..Size - It's so small! And the design is incredibly well thought-out. Everything's in the right place, and easy to use.Quality - Picture quality is fairly consistent if you have the right ISO settings-- I usually use medium or high quality on S or M2-- low quality small pictures are only worth it if you want to just show them to friends and take a zillion, they're not really suitable for printing.While I think I might rather have an EOS Rebel ideally, I'd rather go with something that's 1/3 the price and half the size.

Just over 200 pictures later (at full resolution), I have the photo record of a lifetime!  The images are clear and crisp and the color is excellent.  Even on cloudy days the camera captured great shots.  And even though I took the manual along, the camera is so intuitive I never had to use it.  I played with the various settings throughout but if all you want is easy high quality images you'd never have to bother.  I love that you can preview the pictures on screen and delete them if you're not satisfied.  The battery is long lasting - one would take me through the day and charge up overnight (the extra was a little overkill but appreciated in situations where I couldn't immediately charge).Since returning from the trip, I've transferred the images to my laptop, uploaded the images to Ofoto to share with family and friends, written slide presentations to cd, and had pictures printed in 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10.

I've recommended Canon digital cameras to everyone I know and I've yet to hear a complaint. This camera was EVEN SMALLER than expected...easily HALF the size of my A50! They are not joking when they say it is the size of a deck of cards. Especially since my reason for upgrading was to have a small, yet powerful digital that I can carry along in a waist pack when I run the Honolulu Marathon next week.My limited tests can be seen in the customer image library above, but I am sufficiently impressed to write my review immediately. I did make sure to buy a new camera rather than a refurbished model because I did have two problems with my old Canon, which required the 1-year warranty (you only get 90 days with refurbished). Since the repairs on that old camera, I've not had a problem in the last 3.5 years...despite dropping it a few too many times. The S500 has the same solid construction and aluminum casing, which should also protect it from mild abuse from its owner (I'd also recommend getting a nice little neoprene case for it...they may not always be pretty, but they're amazing protection!).I've not had enough experience yet with it to speak about its battery life, but from past experience, Canons have better than average battery life, which I extend even further by limiting the use of the LCD screen. This models battery isn't much larger than a compact flash card, so I'm interested to see if it's as reliable as their other rechargable batteries. They did one major improvement in the battery charger that is worth noting...it doesn't have a cord. Much like the Apple Powerbook power cord, it has the prongs that fold out for charging and fold in for storage. Such a nice, tidy design for something that is normally cumbersome.I have my degree in photography from Art Center in Pasadena, CA, so I feel qualified to give two solid thumbs up to this camera. It's not professional grade, of course, and any camera with a built-in flash can often give you red-eye or harsh shadows, but it's perfect for snapshots, vacation photos, ebay shots and having fun without carrying around a ton of equipment. It seems that most digitals do their job best when you just use the flash as fill, rather than your only light source...or better yet, turn the flash off and let the ambient light do its job. I know this one has quite a few manual override functions for shutter speeds and such, but I haven't had time to explore them very much yet.My last suggestion would be to get a very large compact flash card in addition to the one that the camera comes with. I purchased a 1GB Ultra 2 from Sandisk (I found one for about $80), and it's very fast and will hold well over 100 uncompressed images. That will keep you from fiddling around with multiple cards when you're out and about.

I was recently looking to buy a digital camera. I have a Petax SLR which my bro has been using for his photography classes.  My bro also had a digital camera but it is a couple years old and batteries have been kinda short lived (canon S45?).  I borrowed it for a while and enjoyed it but it was still too big and heavy.  I really enjoyed my real camera, but I realized my slr is not something that I can bring to a party in my pocket.  I really wanted something small without compromising the image quality.  So I did my home work.  I looked at sony, pentax, casio, nikon,and of course canon. I had my heart settled on a T1 or the new yet to be realeased T3.  5 megapixls and a huge screen and tiny as hell.  But the memory sticks sony uses in particular the duo is small in capacity and pricy.  I was still not entirely dishearted.  When I had some free time I went to a Sony Style store.  He told me due to the small lense size that the color saturation is not the best.  He tried selling me a different sony but they did not catch my eye.  Then I started workin backwards. what is the biggest memory card type?  Compactflash. Best bang for buck? CompactFlash.  Same type of card my bro has too.  So then I favored canon and nikon.  I immediately zoomed in on the s500.  Small fairly light.  Kinda on the heavy side for its size, but not bad at all.  Recharable Li-Ion.  Short movies, 5mp, 3x optical zoom but you knew that.  It had my bro's camera beat.  I bought 2 1gb lexar cards incase one died on me, a spare battery, leather case and compactflash card reader to go with this new toy.  I love it.  I just went on vacation and I did not need to change the battery until the last night.  It was great at parties right into my pocket.  I snuck it into a dashboard concert and got some great picks too.  Did not even need to be that close.  For its size it compromises some of the more advanced features that the s-(doubledigit) line has but I haven't found anything I am missing so far.  I highly recomend getting a Compact flash card reader.  They plug and play with almost any OS mac or PC, and you can avoid all the messy camera software.  I have not tried canon's latest but with the reader I have no need or desire too.  The other benefit is with the reader your memory card doubles for file transfers.

This may be a drawback for some; however the battery is nice and compact, and seems to work just fine for me.The only drawback to this camera, at least that I've encountered, is the flash. It does a nice job of illuminating subjects up to ~10 feet away. Being a small camera, much beyond that and the flash isn't bright enough and pictures come out somewhat dark.

Let me start by saying that I have not bought this model, but that this cautionary note is based on a significant flaw in the design of the S400 which I have. I don't believe this flaw has been corrected in this updated model.I bought an S400 and used it for seven months. I was very happy with it. At that point, however, it stopped working without warning. When I sent it in to the factory service center, I discovered something very troubling about the camera that had I known earlier would have caused me to not purchase it.It turns out that this model--as well as many other Canon digital cameras, the tech told me--has an aluminum body. If you subject the camera to temperature changes (and it only takes a change of 10-15 degrees, I was told) condensation will form inside the camera, and the camera will start to corrode, eventually rendering it unusable.This is what had happened to me. What misuse had I subjected my camera to that caused this to happen? I took it on vacation to the beach with me. Carrying it from the hot and humid beach into an air conditioned car was enough to destroy the camera!The tech told me that he sees this all the time. He didn't know the percent of all Canon cameras that suffer this fate, but he said a lot of them do. He told me he gets lots of cameras back from people who have taken them on vacation to Arizona, Mexico, and Hawaii. He even saw one that had stopped working because the owner kept it stored in a stuffy closet. When the owner eventually took it out to use it, the temperature change back to normal room temperature was enough to fry the camera.I was told that this damage is not covered under warranty and that the manual cautions users not to subject their cameras to this sort of treatment. Canon will not provide service on cameras that suffer this fate. If this happens to your camera during the waranty period you're basically out of luck. You lose the investment you made in the camera and any peripherals that you bought.I hope anyone interested in purchasing a Canon digital camera will learn from my very expensive mistake in purchasing one. See the review section for the S400 on Amazon.com for even more stories from people who have had this same problem.What I said about the S400 holds true here as well. The camera is very nicely designed, but it's poorly engineered. If you plan to use the camera indoors only this is a great model.

Some people have said that Canon does not deliver true skin tones - for me that myth has be shot to bits!

Unfortunately, no matter how well made or how well treated a product may be, there is always a chance that it will need service.  That is why we offer multiple support options for products in-warranty or out-of-warranty.  In the case of an out-of-warranty S400 we offer the Flat Rate Repair and PowerShot Upgrade Programs, both of which were developed from customer feedback.  There is a charge for both of these programs - I am sorry for any dissatisfaction this causes.I can understand why you would have misgivings, but I must caution you against relying on information that may not be credible.  The fact is that the S400 is a successful and robust design as witnessed not only by its excellent sales but also by the service data we have collected since it was introduced two and one half years ago.  Another fact is that Canon has an excellent reputation for a reason.  We use our service data and we constantly review our products and processes to identify opportunities for improvement.  If we find a problem we will act proactively and appropriately.  Examples of this are two different programs related to service notices we published on our website in the past few months.  In both programs we are servicing the related models at no cost no matter the warranty status.  Further, we are refunding customers who paid for related service in the past.  This is how we have always conducted our business and it is how we intend to continue to do so.I hope that my responsiveness demonstrates our commitment to your satisfaction.  I also hope that the information I provide reassures you.If I can offer any further help, you are welcome to call my toll free telephone number, 866-865-7815, extension 2569.Sincerely,Brian StoutCanon Customer Relations", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not quite ideal", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RK64GTH8HDZSU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: A year on the camera still works fine. It's still too slow for any sort of action shot and there's no way to put it into shutter priority so far as I can tell. As a belt camera I still haven't found anything better and it's showing very little sign of wear from being with me every day. Battery life is still very good. However, the slow reaction of the camera has driven me to buy an EOS-20D. I can't take it everywhere but it's way better for any form of action. Curiously some of my best scenic shots are still with the S500. Would I buy it again? Only if I couldn't get something the same size with shutter priority and faster reactions to the shutter release.After a couple of weeks of taking pictures and experimenting with settings I'd say this is good, great in many circumstances, but not perfect.Some of the issues are just limitations of the form factor, the form factor was the deciding point in my choice of cameras. Perhaps I had some unrealistic expectations of the ability of technology to overcome physics?Basically, with a 5M pixel sensor and a tiny little lens you don't get fast shutter speeds unless you either have excellent lighting or use the flash. Fortunately the flash is perhaps unexpectedly powerful, so most indoor shots can be well lit and fill-in can be used outdoors, though you seem to have to go to manual mode to force the flash to be used.The battery seems to last well even when using the flash. Some reviews say you need to use one battery while charging another. Well, I don't know what they were doing, I meant to change the battery yesterday morning and the camera is still going strong today, I think that's about 150 pictures since I last changed the battery for the spare. Batteries still have memory effect even though it is less pronounced than with NiCd technology of the past, the NiMH battery in the laptop I am using now has only half the capacity it should.Anyway, back to the camera. The metering system isn't clairvoyant, it does sometimes pick the wrong subject, especially in backlit conditions which is why I know about forcing it to use fill-in floash.Indoor shots without the flash will often be blurred, I took one just after landing in Chicago ORD and there was a lot of blurred motion on walking people though I had managed to hold the camera steady as the background was sharp. If you don't use the red-eye reduction mode on the flash you will get amazing red-eye.I use a 512Mb Sandisk Ultra II that I picked up for about $120, that gives me about 350 shots in fine mode. The speed of the card hasn't really been a noticeable benefit the way I have used the camera.The colors are good, I'm not certain they are great, I have a suspicion they are a little blue. Certainly blue scenes seem very blue.Speaking of blue... my old Olympus shows red flares to the right of bright edges, so a white light will have a red halo to the right. On a couple of shots the S500 has shown a blue halo to the left, one example was a person standing with their back to a very brightly lit window, even though he was correctly exposed. Perhaps fill-in flash would have fixed this, but that would have given some red-eye.In summary, this camera has shown me that there's no substitute for big pieces of glass even in the modern day, the lens is still the most important part of a camera. My old Olympus 3040z with an f1.8 lens was much more effective in low light... but I never had it with me when I wanted to take a picture \"right now\". The S500 in the small belt pouch with the 512Mb compact flash has proven sufficient for about 3 days of casual photography. However, if I want to take memorable and sharp scenic shots I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy the EOS10D. I hear now that the S410 may have better low light performance, so perhaps I'll sell my S500 and try that instead.", "Date": "June 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exquisite little gem!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R25B7LH1V9URQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a 20D which I absolutely love and was getting tired of lugging it around and was therefore looking for a good digital point and shoot. My two major candidates were the S500 and the S70.If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S500 vs the S60/70. The S60/70 offers excellent manual controls while the S500 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation. I just LOVE the look and feel of the S500 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small. If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.The S500 is simply beautiful. I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 20D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 20D around.Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S60/70 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size. This is a very good argument! The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S70. The form and size factors are what finally won me over.One criticism of the camera. Low light focusing is less than ideal. You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.  Also, battery life could be better, but that's the price you pay for such a small camera.The sensor size of the S500 is the same as that of the S60 and the S70 - 1/1.8\".  This is an ideal size for a point and shoot IMO.  The 1/2.5\" sensor used in the smaller SD series cameras represents a poor image quality trade off.  Stick with the larger sensor which give less noise, chromatic aberration, and better image quality.I purchased the leather Elph case which protects the camera well and only adds insubstantially to the bulk.  Some have complained that prior iterations of this camera scratch easily.  I've owned them and found that if you keep the camera in a case and exercise modest caution that the camera will remain pristine.The pictures are just fantastic!  Color saturation is superb and the file size is sufficient that you can crop moderately with little negative impact.  Other than in low light the camera locks onto its subject quickly and accurately.One other consideration:  The S700 will undoubtedly be hitting the streets soon.  It will employ the larger Sony sensor used by the S70 which gives fantastic results.  It might be worth your while waiting.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon currently represents the state of the art.", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Defective camera", "Author": "Photographer \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R3SJVA8CLH8O1I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Canon S400, S410 and S500 have all had serious reliability problems.

We decided to buy the camera from Best-buy for $499.00 and bought their extended 4yr warranty along with it for an additional $79 (because it is sooo small and also because I had read about the E18 errors of the S100.)We chose the camera mainly because it was the only one that actually gave us clear pictures of our daughter who barely sits still.  A side-by-side comparison with the DSC-P10, P92, P72 etc put the Sonys to shame.  None of them - could give sharp pictures of moving objects.  The Nikon CoolPix 5700 was good but a tad over budget.  We did have to use the Quick Shot mode to get the sharp pictures but even without quick shot it consistently gave us good pictures (all these tests were done using the floor models at the 3 stores.)  The sales men at the Penn Camera were the best informed and the staff at Circuit City was the worst.  The staff at Best-Buy was clueless but very helpful - spending almost an hour with me obliging by supplying me with the necessary memory cards etc. on each visit.  The most helpful was my daughter who obliged me by never sitting still so I could do a true side by side comparison.Huge disappointment when we got the camera home.  The moment it was fired up in my comparatively poorly lit home(as compared to Best Buy) I noticed a light blue dot on the right side of the LCD (just sightly of dead center.)  It would show up very clearly when I focused on any dark object.  The same dot didn't show on my Sony Vega, or when I played back the images.  Took it back to Best Buy less then 24 hours purchasing it.  First they refused to see the dot.  Then they agreed it was there and admitted it was a problem with the Lens and was even showing up on prints and that others had complained about it.  Apparently even the first floor model had the same problem.  Canon is aware of it and has fixed it on the newer ones.  What bugs me is that even though they were aware of the problem they didn't do a recall and Best Buy didn't bother to test the Camera before selling it.  They don't have any more in stock but a branch 20 miles from here has ONE but they can put it on hold for us to go and pick up.  I called the store and found out they have 5 in stock.  Now I am going to pick 1 from there but of course I will be testing it before I bring it home.  I'm going to keep it as I have the 4 year warranty from BB.  Looks like I may need it.Update:  Got the camera exchanged.  Have been toying with it since and am amazed with the picture quality.

As others have suggested, it id definately worth purchasing a larger capacity memory card if you intend to go on vacation with your camera as the 32MB included takes only 11 pictures at full size. I also use a close fitting case rather than one with lots of padding and pockets. I think using a bigger case defeats the object of having such a small camera in the first place.

I have been comparing shots with the s50 and s500 and one thing that I did notice is that the LCD is of a better quality on the s50 and that would mean the images would look much better when viewing from the LCD monitor. I was able to view images that I took with the s500 on the s50 and the images from the s500 looked much sharper , clearer and superior. So I will be keeping the s500 for a long while. I also noticed a few unhappy customers that experienced error problems or LCD cracks. For those, I would recommend that you purchase the camera from a store that will issue a refund like COSTCO , this is my first choice in purchasing digital cameras because you can return it at any time whether its 1 month or 1 year from now, as long as you have the receipt.

She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck!

I have never used a Canon before but I decided to give it a go because of the great reviews. The first concern when buying a camera is the picture quality. You ask yourself if this camera will take a good picture every time you point and shoot. Well it does not! It takes about 4 good pictures out of 10. I took 250 pictures on my trip; bought the 512MB memory card, only 60 of them were print worthy. All other came out blurry or with dust particle in the air because of the strong flash. Needless to say that my wife was extremely mad at me for the horrible pictures. It maybe true that you could fiddle around a lot with the menu options that might improve your images, but on the other hand the option menu seems to be in Hebrew, impossible to understand. I'm a very well educated person, engineer, extremely computer and technologically savvy, but this menu is just impossible. If somebody tells you it's a cinch, it's probably because they spent well over a year trying to figure it out or have owned Canon cameras all their life. This is not a Point-&-Click Camera. I just was so extremely disappointed in Canon, so many good reviews that mean nothing. Hopefully this review will shed some light to perspective buyers. What camera should I buy then? You ask. I just don't know. Sony's are truly point and shoot cameras and their menus are much more easy to use. They use words like Menu, Video, and Resolution. Canon uses symbols and letters, very confusing. I would look at Cnet reviews and PC World reviews to see which Sony is on top. But overall this camera is on the bottom of my list. I write this review not to damage the image of Canon or to hurt Amazon sales but to inform buyers into making a right choice from personal experience. I never buy anything without ever reading the reviews, they provide a world of insight that the manufacturer can't mention.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Lil' Thing", "Author": "barbara dubail", "ReviewID": "R3UI3H9V8F7R50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im 16, going to portugal for a year.
