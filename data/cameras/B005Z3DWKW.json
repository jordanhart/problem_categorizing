Great photos even in low light, fast response, lots of options (plenty for beginner-intermediate photographer). The telephoto lens is well worth the investment.A tip: There are lots of lens options for this camera. You can get a cheaper telephoto lens (for example the 75-300 that comes in another bundled combo set) but pay close attention to what you're getting: the 75-300 does NOT have image stabilization. The 55-250 IS lens that comes in this bundle is a better lens - a great match for this camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "55-250 lens and T3 Bundle", "Author": "Evil Spoon", "ReviewID": "R17N5KDQ9BLXC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not going to add to the conversation on how great this camera and lens both are for their individual prices. Yep! They're great! I just wanted to give people a heads up -- DO THE MATH!! Sometimes it is cheaper to buy the camera and the telephoto lens separately... as much as $120 cheaper if you shop around. Sometimes this bundle will price itself low enough to be worth the money. Sometimes not. So be careful and don't just buy this up. As of the moment I am writing this, you'd save $70 on Amazon buying the two products seperately. That, of course, is subject to change.Happy shopping!", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEST CAMERA EVER!!", "Author": "roach1upkennels", "ReviewID": "R20V733R8F1K3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for family/dog/motocross photos and couldn't be HAPPIER!

This is our first dslr camera, and what I like most is to be able to look through the viewfinder at our kids and be able to take the shot the instant you see that expression your looking for.

I assume if you care about rapid RAW format shooting this is not for you but as someone who tends to shoot JPEG mainly I have this camera to be a perfect fit. the grip is very good and I don't feel a lack of the rubberized grip of the higher 'i' series. taking multiple short concurrently (I normally take 3-4 in succession to choose the best) is easy, responsiveness with and without flash is great, battery life cannot is unequaled by anything I used before. in short - very close to perfect and the price/performance really cannot be beat.

The manual is so long and there are so many possibilities that I'm not sure if I will be ever able to use all. I'm thinking about taking some classes and learn more about my camera, so I can take full advantage of it. At first, I had issues playing the videos on my computer. They were all blurry and had these red horizontal lines. I read the manual, and it seemed that I was doing everything right, but for some reason I couldn't fix the issue. I thought about returning the camera because I was certain that it was damaged. Then, I contacted Canon and they sent me an email asking some specific questions. The issue was that I had not installed the canon software on my computer (genius jumped this step) and I was copying/pasting the videos and trying to play them on Windows Media Player. Canon customer service representative \"hold my hand\" and went with me step-by-step over all the things I need to do. It does work perfectly now.

It's very user friendly and doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.  I just want to take really nice pictures without having the fully understand f-stops, shutter speeds, iso settings, etc...  The videos also are very clear with a great microphone which surprised me.  I'll actually shoot more videos than expected.  The only thing I don't like is having to swith between the 18-55mm to the 55-250mm.  This gets a little cumbersome at times, but getting an 18-200mm will likly handle most environments.
