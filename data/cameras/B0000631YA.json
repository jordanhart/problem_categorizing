{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy for those who want to point & shoot", "Author": "MoonPye \"Monica\"", "ReviewID": "RSC37Q1KYFBXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With 2.11 megapixels this camera is a good value for the money.  At the highest resolution you should be able to blow a print up to 8x10.  Camera is easy to use, basically just point & shoot.  Push shutter button halfway for auto focus.  Altho with default setting you can only get about 10-12 pictures on the 8MB internal memory, if you change the setting to 800 x 600 you can get 40 pictures instead, which I prefer because these pics won't take up as much room on your hard drive.  (and this size looks great when I blow up the picture to use as a background on my computer!)  With a 32 MB CF card you can get up to 180!!  The red eye works very well.  I've found with other cameras I always had a problem with red eye when taking pictures of my dog, but with this one I haven't had that problem.  The software that comes with this camera is very user friendly.  The closeup function works pretty well, you just have to watch the lighting with that to get good quality pics. The camera uses up batteries fast, but all of them do when you use the LCD display alot, which I do.***UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW***I originally wrote the above in 2002, before my first child was even born (this camera was a wedding gift).  I have since moved on to dSLRs and away from point & shoots.  My 7 year old daughter is now using this camera as her first digital camera!  This little thing has held up remarkably well over the years.  Of course technology has improved GREATLY since then, so this is perfect for a child who is practicing, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to an adult who already has experience with point & shoots... but I felt compelled to comment on the quality of this item and remark on the fact that it's still going strong!Exposure can be a little tricky with it, and of course with only 2 mp the quality of the shots is not going to be perfect, but this camera is far superior to the digitals that are on the market right now aimed at the children's market.", "Date": "June 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, Excellent picture quality", "Author": "Steve Herr", "ReviewID": "R9LUV9QQNN3VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first experience with digital cameras was an Olympus that was rather awkward.  This model by Vivitar makes digital photography about as easy as it can get.  In about 5 minutes I figured out the basics of taking, reviewing, and downloading pictures.  I bought it in a kit that included all of the necessary cables.  Despite complaints of poor picture quality by one reviewer, I found them to be sharp and clear.  I would reccomend this without qualification to anyone as an excellent entry-level digital camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "J. Amos", "ReviewID": "R379GJ13NN8YW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I were looking for a digital camara for the best price.The picture quality is really good (2.1 MP) but at varying light situations the pix fluctuate. Weve taken shots at the house with quite a bit of light and they look good, but at a school gym (with the gyms lights all on, not in the dark) for our childs show the pix were horrible. There was enough light in the pix but blurry and very grainy. Weve taken shots outdoors during the day and it works great. Computers treat it as another hard drive using the included USB cable (plugs into USB port) so it is very easy to download and send pix to whomever (there is also included software to look at and edit the pix plus it will cut the pix size in half when saved through the software). It came with the internal 8mb flashcard but you really have to upgrade to collect any of the best format pix. we bought a 64 MB flash card and it holds about 78 highest quality pix. All in all, great camara for the price but you might want to upgrade (you get what you pay for) for better reliability in varying light conditions. Plus, this will burn through standard batteries like a wildfire. Rechargeable batteries helped alot! They were the Quest rechargeables (comes with a charger).", "Date": "November 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good and [reasonable priced] entry-level camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3QZEA3MJ08REB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera, and it didn't cover my expectations. I'm an advanced amateur on film photography, and the results with this digital camera were just acceptable. If you are planning to do some printing from your pictures, this camera won't be good enough, but if you gonna use it only for digital viewing and emailing, it'll be ok.Pros: low price (a bit more than a hundred bucks at your local wholesale store), high resolution, macro capability, good flash light, ease of use, nice pictures at daylight, and nice advanced features like 2x digital zoom, EV compensation, whites balancing and red-eye reduction.Cons: slooow to focus and to be ready for the next shot, lack of an optical zoom (I know, I know, it's only a hundred-bucks-entry-level camera, but it could have been nice to have); only 800x600 and 1600x1200 resolution pictures but nothing else in between, heavy weight, extremelly awful results under flourescent lighting, and definivelly the worst of all, short battery life. It drains the batteries like crazy, and by using the flash, the LCD and 1600x1200 resolution altogether, it will swallow a fresh set of (4) alkaline batteries by making only 40 to 50 shots (ouch). A good set of rechargeable batteries is a must.", "Date": "April 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH  VERSATILITY AT A GREAT  VALUE!!!", "Author": "M.

I'm not unfamiliar with Vivitar's products.  In fact, I have a model 2750 that I've used for the last two years without any trouble, and the pics from THAT one look very clear. The res. for the 2750 is 640 x 480, so I expected the pics from the 3615 would be MUCH clearer (2 MP) , but they weren't.  I tried different light settings, focus settings, but nothing changed.  I even tried putting the 3615 on a tri-pod and using the timer.  Pics still looked grainy, especially if I tried using the digital zoom.  Trying to magnify the finished photos made matters much worse (lots of pixelation).  I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, so I even tried different flash cards.  Same results (grainy, sometimes out of focus pics).  When I showed the pics to some of my friends (and compared it with pics from the 2750) they couldn't believe the difference.Needless to say the camera went back.  Vivitar, you have disappointed me.

The only problem I had was that sometimes the camera would stop responding when the batteries got low but other than that it was easy to use and took good pictures.

It was a great little hard working camera with no problems until 6 months later I accidentally dropped it and it stopped working (ALWAYS WEAR THAT HAND STRAP, I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH! It can get knocked out of your hands and it won't matter how 'tight' your grip on it is). Anyway, I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it. Four years later, my friend said that digital cameras will sometimes start working again if they had a chance to 'rest'.  So I put the batteries in,tested it and SURPRISE! It started right up with no problems! Who knew? I'm glad I didn't throw it out.  So if it stops working for whatever reason, let it rest for a month and then try it again.
