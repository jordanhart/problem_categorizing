{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture quality, good low light capability, but moderate shutter lag.", "Author": "Kumba8", "ReviewID": "R3PYWPZBX8ADEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is simple to use and takes great pictures underwater.  We used it on our snorkeling trip to Indonesia and were very happy with the image quality.  The only complaint had to do with the moderate shutter lag:  I ended up with quite a few pictures of the back half of fish, because although they were completely in the frame when I pushed the shutter button, they had moved by the time the shutter actually opened.  Aside from that, it performed well both above and below water.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "PowerShot D20 Yellow Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411kbHy-4GL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00791DLIG"}}
