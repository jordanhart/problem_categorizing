I bought it more for it's size and lens retraction (or lack there of) versus picture quality since it's purely a point and shoot camera.  I need to get a DSLR at some point...I had a Canon SD940IS but returned it after I saw this camera coming out.  Initial picture quality is a little better on the Canon, but the HD video on the T99 is better, and with better sound quality too.  I haven't been into all the manual modes yet on the T99, so I may be able to tweek and improve on the picture quality.  The menu on th T99 takes a little getting used to as the Canon menus are all very simple.Startup time is very fast in auto mode, less than 3 seconds from opening the lens to taking the first picture.Touchscreen is clear and responsive and icons are big enough for even larger fingers.  I plan on getting a touchscreen protector to help with scratches and fingerprints.Overall appearance of the camera is very slick.If you want something compact, quick and sexy, this is a good start.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "user friendly", "Author": "Happy Shopper,Woodland Hills, CA", "ReviewID": "R3ASHC1RI81EVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just acquired this camera barely a month and am loving it. The few times I've used it has been no problem for me. This product beats the quality of my other previous Sony cybershots at the $400 range for its price along the $200's. Although am still getting used to its features and functions, at this point, the instructions have been so user friendly. Things I like best with this camera are its lighweight compact size, blinkproof feature, high ISO capability, fast shooting speed (no more of that problem I had to deal with my other expensive Sony cybershot where even after you have clicked the shot button, if your subject moves, it blurs the final shot, each time, I had to let my subjects hold still for a few more seconds even after the camera's been clicked,..this camera does not have this problem, thank goodness..once you focus and shoot..you're safe your final picture outcome will be okay especially if you have an impatient subject.) I was also excited to discover its variable picture frame/paint styles in the menu for postcard-type perhaps to be sent to friends and family.. the only disappointment so far with this one, is being an advanced technology camera, it is unable to playback videos even from an old pro duo memory card recorded from another older cybershot..you'd think that it can playback older models being more advanced like still being able to play a regular DVD in a blueray disc player, but not with this one..definitely, its playback has no problems if recorded of course with this camera (a Sony Rep has already explained to me about this camera's inability to playback a downgrade video memory), the panoramic shooting capability is also awesome. For its price and purpose especially for the upcoming Holiday with all the picture taking involved, this camera, is one great model to buy and keep...I'd greatly recommend to other interested techno phobics like me.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent piece.", "Author": "Sachin Airani", "ReviewID": "R20RG1NA1ZPWIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was waiting for some time now for this piece of wonder...does the justice to all the hype that is created around the camera.

Has a very good menu navigation. the operations system is pretty cool too - can switch to an easy view for people who do not like all the complications and can switch back to regular mode for more settings. very light weighted, small - smaller than my Nokia N900 :) Touchscreen is ok..does its job.low light pictures are cool too. Im happy I bought this !!!", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "downgrade", "Author": "spr \"spr\"", "ReviewID": "RL47086TP8LBC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My primary complaint about this camera is that I was expecting an 'upgrade' as I was replacing our older Sony 8.1 megapixel T100 (that has image stabilization failure so the camera vibrates... a common problem with them I have found)This camera isnt 1/2 what the T100 is. Its is almost totally unresponsive, the touch screen is tedious to use - often close to nonfunctional, manual control is just about non-existent besides exposure. Shutter delay/lag is laughably long, flash control is limited (eg: no fill flash option or +/- stop adjustment) even previewing images is annoying and difficult. The zoom control is slow to respond and tends to 'smart zoom' either too far in or too far out no matter what the settings are onto what it thinks is the intended subject. 'Burst' mode is totally useless and can just about manage a bit more than 1 frame per second...sortof. The 'sweep panorama' generates blurry, low quality images - you are much better off stitching your own together and I will probably only use it if I get lazy. Navigating menu options while shooting is again - slow.The only good things I can say about this camera is that has a fairly wide angle lens on it, battery endurance was moderately good, it is slim/small/light, and in good lighting and set to full auto, it takes OK pictures - I suppose same as any point and shoot 14 megapixel camera.... anything demanding or tricky, and this camera is almost - but not quite - a waste of time.As a new user to this camera I may warm up to it a bit after I learn to live (or work with) its many weaknesses - but first impresions after shooting about 300 images on a recent shoirt trip is that the computing power of this camera is a inadequate to process the considerable automatic features, 'scene selections' and touch screen interface. Compared to the T100, this has more features but is less usable in practice - I would say temper your expectations if you are a semi-serious shooter. If you are someone who will leave it on 'automatic' forever - then it may work better for you. Maybe.*** Update, several months later ***  This camera is worse than even I thought - in low light and even sunny days where glare is a problem - this camera is about non-functional.  In any outdoors high contrast situation... even with the sun at your back - the camera produces vertical streaks/lines on the images - even with the sun at your back or from the side.  This is not a 'glare' problem... this is nonfunctional image processing.  After returning to Sony for repair (this is a known issue and no, a 'reset' will not correct it), I expect I will be shelving it and buying something else - it is a total write-off.

But anyway.....Pros:  Slim, attractive design, fairly responsive touchscreen, price ($189 total), excellent Intelligent Auto mode, easy to navigate, high ISO sensitivity, and internal lens.Cons:  Limited functions and features, no focus tracking, average shutter speed, slow burst mode, low screen resolution, and location of its lens.I was looking for a touchscreen, slim, attractive camera for under $200.  I narrowed it down to Canon SD3500 and Sony DSC-T99.  I love Canon (had one for a few years).  I tried both of them.  Picture quality is about the same if you use proper settings, however, the SD3500 consistently take better pictures than the T99.  Pet mode on T99 sucks by the way.  Generally, T99 doesn't do well with moving objects, but it beats SD3500 on macro mode.  SD3500 has way more scene modes, camera settings, and other nice features/controls (like focus tracking, HDMI port, smile/wink self timers, photo effects, playback timer, automatic tilt of vertical images, better optical image stabilization, ability to erase part of movie, etc).  Its screen is also bigger and clearer.  It's optical zoom is 5x, T99 is only 4x.  There are more misc features/controls that make SD3500 a better pick.  But I decided to keep the T99 mainly because of its design and price.  T99 is one of the slimmest, smallest touchscreen cameras on the market, plus it looks way sexier than SD3500.  Picture quality (which isn't bad, just average) isn't a deal breaker for me since I don't make large prints.  Night shots work well.  Video quality is good for a point and shoot camera.  And since T99's Intelligent Auto mode works quite well, I could give up Canon's extensive scene modes and controls.  All in all, if you can get this camera for under $190 and love its design , grab it!!", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "this camera stinks!", "Author": "Jennifer Santolla \"Monkeypup\"", "ReviewID": "R39NG8FRA01U30", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a brilliant sized camera, and the video it takes is amazing!

I'm not asking for much, i have a dslr camera for my important shots, but I like to have a point and click camera for going out.And for a 14 megapixel camera, it takes horrible grainy pictures.

My old one lasted forever and didn't actually die, but the batter hinge broke off after dropping it one day. I was excited to get this model. I'm not a photography major, I just prefer old-fashioned cameras to capture my life to crappy phone resolutions.  After having it for a few years now, here are the pros and consPros:-EXCELLENT quality sound when taking videos- Great with simple photos-Sharp resolution and vivid colors-Nice features (such as the panoramic views and smile detector).-Battery lasts FOREVER (lasts longer if you take it out of the camera before storing)-Small size makes it easy to carry and fits in your pocket really easily.-Easy to charge, easy to upload pictures to your computer-Stores music and videos well-Sharp videos (great with concerts:)Cons:-The touch screen itself is surprisingly not as good as my older model. It's even hard to use sometimes, making it difficult to scroll through images.-A few dead pixels within a month-Takes a long time to start up which is annoying when you need to capture something quickly.-The battery will drain itself if you leave it stored in the camera.Overall a decent quality camera.

The W7 is a camera I've had for around five years and takes really good pictures but it's too bulky to fit in your pocket comfortably. I figured the T99 would be a great upgrade. I was wrong. Despite the W7 being many years older than the T99, the W7's picture quality was easily twice as nice. This was really disappointing to discover. In addition to that, the T99 has panoramic mode which is a feature I was excited about. Well, that excitement faded when I saw the quality of the panoramas it took. They were blurry, drab, and dull. This camera is just crappy in my opinion. My last comparison I'll make is between this T99 and my cell phone camera (HTC One). The HTC One's pictures are way better than the T99.

Loved it, although the touchscreen was difficult to use in bright sunlight; wished it had a viewfinder as alternative for those situations.  Last week I was on vacation in Yosemite National Park, and on our first day there, the camera became inoperable with no warning.  I was taking shots fine one minute, and then all of a sudden I noticed it had put itself in video mode (no, I didn't accidentally push the screen to switch modes).  I switched it back to still images and it took a few more shots, but then began blinking an error... E:61:00. I was able to view previous photos, but the camera would not allow me to take any more. I reset it several times, and tried new batteries and memory cards. Internet research revealed this is a common error with this and other Sony models. The error has to do with the focusing mechanism hanging up.  Most suggestions for fixing included banging the camera on a flat surface to jar the mechanism. (Honest! Google it!) Recent Sony models house the lens behind plastic, as with the T99, so I can't access it to give the lens mechanism a nudge to reset. $150 to send away for repair; exact model new $136 on Amazon.  I got a year and a half of moderate usage (summer vacations, holiday gatherings) and now need a new camera.  Initial price of gift was well above current price. If that's what you expect for your electronic purchase, this camera is fine. For me, not so acceptable.

In my opinion, it is great. It is not a SLR camera, but it does a great job. I used it in my photography class and it worked fine.

Its small size is nice so I could take it with me practically anywhere. The only thing that I was disappointed with was that it does not have adjustable aperture or a longer shutter speed than a second. They might have added this to the newer editions.
