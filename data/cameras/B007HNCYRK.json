{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Martinjm", "ReviewID": "RXVL8XNEZ5LV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initial indications after taking just a few photos at different settings left me very impressed with the SX260.  Picture quality and zoom are fabulous.  Startup is quick as well as the speed at which it focuses and ultimately takes the photo.  Finger grip on the front is a nice touch for a camera of this size and weight.  It can easily slip out of your hands and this certainly helps (I always struggled with this on my smaller, lighter Canons).Some annoyances are the flash on the top where you tend to place your finger.  Not sure about the \"easy setting\" on the dial for taking pictures.  I understand the overall point, I just don't know how it makes things any simpler than the full auto function.  I would have liked to see them take this off the dial and replace it with a pre-programmed scene setting or the capability to have a fully programmable setting.  Along those same lines, there appears to be a couple \"empty\" spots on the dial that I think could have been reserved for the ability to pre-program some settings.I would probably give the camera a 4.5 rating given the flash location, but the picture quality and zoom for the price make this an awesome point and shoot.I have not yet used the GPS, but will try this weekend to see how it affects the battery.UPDATE April 27, 2012:Went on a 7 hour hike with the GPS on, took 80 photos and a couple videos and battery is still at full strength.  Very happy with the photo quality.  Still highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL!!!", "Author": "Baby Dee \"Baby Dee\"", "ReviewID": "RKKTS76598A9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon PowerShot SX260HS Camera Bundle for our family trip to Disneyland.  I LOVE IT!!!The bundle included the camera, a case, a memory card (16GB), a memory card reader, an extra battery, a mini tripod, a cleaning kit, cleaning cloth and some screen protectors.The camera works wonderfully.  I haven't had any problems with it.  It is small and compact, which is exactly what I wanted.  You can take pictures almost instantly.  It takes beautiful, crisp and vibrant pictures even on the \"auto\" setting (meaning, even if you do not know what aperture or f-stop to use and/or are not necessarily photography savvy...  I mean, it is a point and shoot camera).  The zoom on the camera is INCREDIBLE!  I feel like paparazzi...  You can really get up close without being THAT close!  I noticed a small lag time when trying to take pictures one after the other but that may be something I can adjust with my settings.I chose this bundle because the camera and extras were worth it to me because it came with the memory card, extra battery and case.  The cleaning kit, cleaning cloth and tripod will come in handy eventually.  The memory card reader is a nice extra.  I tried putting one of the screen protectors on but you have to cut it to the size you need, which was not necessarily the problem.  It was more the application...  It's like contact paper (adhesive sticks to the actual screen) so you can see EVERYTHING that gets in between the adhesive and the camera screen.  I think the only way to have a successful application would be by being in a sterile, lint-free environment...  And have no fingerprints, because those showed up too!  I just left the screen protectors off since it was too much trouble.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Barbara S", "ReviewID": "R3T0S79514WHVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my camera.

The printed guide walks you through the setup process and it is pretty straight forward.The camera does take some getting used to, especially with the pop-up flash located right where we are used to holding a camera.  The printed start-up guide is helpful, but the full PDF guide is where the real information is located and requires you to install the supplied software on a PC.  Consider getting an additional battery, especially if you are going to be using the WIFI feature or reviewing pictures on the LCD viewfinder.
