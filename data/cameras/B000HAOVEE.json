I hate reading directions, so I popped the battery and memory card in and I was off!  Very user friendly, and has all the right options. Plus, its about the size of the average cell phone. The coolest thing about the powershot is that it knows which way you're holding the camera, so if you hold it vertical to get a tall shot, the viewer turns all by itself.  I also love that you can edit video on the camera and set up slide shows.  Its very easy to load pics onto my computer with the USB connection - or to set up a slide show for the TV.  It even holds voice memos and has cute sound effects when I take pictures.  This is really a great camera.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Quality, Size & convienience", "Author": "Maria Mejia \"Pitahia\"", "ReviewID": "R2UHN8DS7II2UH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this small, high quality camara.

It takes nice pictures (notably not THE best) and is easy to use, but the best feature was always the size.  It's so compact - perfect for a guy like me that wants to shove his camera into a pocket.  It was smaller than even my cell phone.  So, when it was time to upgrade, the SD40 was the natural choice.  I love the new features and updates that the SD40 offers.  I was, however, surprised to see the Twilight Sepia version, as when it arrived, the metal trim was gold, not silver like the picture looks or like the other color choices for this model have.  I can live with it, but it was not what I was expecting.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "For Great Snapshots on the Go...", "Author": "Daniel Bargen", "ReviewID": "R3DS9FICUMQU9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for my fianc\u00e9e, and she loves it. With very little need (or capability) for manual adjustments, this little guy takes excellent photos. Features like facial recognition and good flash/aperture auto-adjust make this easy to point and shoot while looking at the surprisingly large LCD display on the back.This model doesn't come with a viewfinder, and it doesn't need one for the group it appeals to. The LCD is plenty big. In fact, it has a decently dense resolution for its size, unlike the large-pixel size seen on screens of many other cameras. Facial recognition is very accurate and can pick up a dozen or so people at a glance. Only rarely have I seen it think inanimate objects are people worthy of bringing into sharp focus.It's small size her carry it around with her everywhere in an extra coinpurse. That little bit of protection keeps the recessed display safe enough, and lets her photograph everything and anything. I might start to regret how handy that is for her with the massive number of pictures she takes now.The included dock is a great accessory as the camera can just sit there charge and upload photos or output to a TV or similar display.At 7.1 MPs, it's a good camera for 4x6's or even larger photos. The lens is nice and sharp in most every situation. A few post-processing steps can even fix the usual problem of the on-board flash (you'll see than in any non-DSLR). Little white balance adjustment is ever needed, and the lens picks up a lot of detail near and far. Just don't count on getting many fine art portraits with this model.If you have fast-moving little ones, or an active nightlife, this model is pretty much ready to go most anytime you want to photo document what's going on around you. Not to mention that the current drop in price on Amazon makes it an easy decision for a first digital camera or even an upgrade to your current point-and-shoot. While it's not exactly what I'd want in a camera for what I do, it's great for the laymen or if you just want to record a few moments of your life without much hassle.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "G.

My main camera is a Nikon SLR, but I wanted something that I could keep in my pocket and snap away without all the bulk of the SLR. The SD40 is small enough to keep in your pocket, it produces great pictures and the on camera editing feature is very nice to change color hue, I particularly like the vivid setting. The video is also very capable, battery life is good and a 2gb card holds enough storage for the pixel count of the camera, the flash is very small so don't expect great results with it. The LCD is a bit small and hard to see in daylight but that is a trade off for the overall size. I also like the blue lighted button on the back that lets you shoot in a vertical position.

I hate reading instructions and this camera was very user friendly and very compact. I got it for my wife for Valentines day and she adores the color too. I guess the only negative thing I would have to say so far is that the memory card it came with was very small 16mb. I can not take videos for long or save many pics. But, that is a feature you can upgrade. I saw a 4GB on sale at Office Depot for $49.99. I am definetly going to upgrade it so I could take long videos and save hundreds of pics while on vacation. One other thing I notice is that when looking at an image through the LCD sceen, it looks fuzzy. But the picture comes out fine. Maybe I just don't know how to use all the features yet.Oh and finally, it should come with a carring case.

Williams \"consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R1R4DWTWTYFD5E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera (in Tuxedo Black) several years ago as a Christmas present, after having made my special interest in the camera known after reading a number of reviews about compact digital cameras. I especially focused on Canon products because I have owned two (2) 35mm single reflex cameras in the past, all of which we great quality cameras. This was my first try at camera digital technology. At that time (2004) the retail price was pretty high (over $400.00). The purchase was made through Amazon and I no problems with it out of the box. I, too, do not like to read a whole lot of instructions when trying out something new (except when it is obviously very difficult to use or understand it's operation). In this case, after a minimum of reading in the \"short\" manual, I was able to take very nice, clear and detailed pictures without much difficulty.However, after several weeks of use, I had occasion to take a special set of photographs that I wanted to archive and keep for my family. At the time the pictures that were taken when many memorable poses were struck, the lighting was completely right, and the occasion was a once in a lifetime thing. I had gone as far as to purchase a large capacity Scandisk Memory card (2.0 GB) to insure I would be able to memorialize the occasion. I took just over 80 photos, well within the limits of the card.When I tried to download the pics to my computer, review them, and eventually print out some of the photos, I noticed an error message on the camera (memory error). I even tired to recover the photos using \"so-called\" recovery software, both by Scandisk and following instructions from Canon. All to no avail. I soon learned that the photos were lost forever. Needless to say I was very upset. How could a name-brand product(s)malfunction in this manner at THIS time (barring any operator error)?After I calmed down I began to work the problem and conducted a little research. What I learned was that the Scandisk brand (that particular model/item) had a history of malfunctioning. What I also learned was that the Canon is not very sturdy and can succumb to error when handled roughly.Ever since that time the camera consistently displays an error message (Image Error or Memory Error) when after turning the camera on to take photos you either hold it at an angle, move it suddenly, or just on \"general principle\" it decides not display the subject of the picture (black screen with error message), and will not take a picture until you turn it OFF, shake it gently, and then turn it ON again. Sometimes that method will not work, so you have to remove and re-insert the battery (whether it reads fully charged or not), or you have to remove and re-insert the memory card. There is no way to determine how this makes the camera work again, or which is the offending item between the battery or the memory card. Sometimes this method does not work either. You may also find that the zoom function on the camera stops working and only zooms to two zones, not three.Additionally, the camera does not work with certain \"low\" capacity memory chips. Make/brand and capacity vary.What I did, since the problem is difficult to explain to Canon for the purpose of getting it repaired, is to purchase a memory chip with \"Backup/Recovery Software\". In the event that you ever encounter another \"incident\" like I did, you may be able to save those special memories. Also, get used to the idea of having to shake the camera, turn it on and off before it will again start ot work \"properly\".Otherwise, the camera is generally great, compact, light-weight, fair to good auto-focus, internal flash is weak/inadequate, zoom is nice (when it works). However, sometimes there is a \"hesitation\" for the camera to fire when it it auto-focusing (sort of slow). You will find a LOT of red-eye situations with this camera (you will eventually get tired to having to retouch your pictures with Red-Eye software.)The Canon photo software is effective, but there are better packages on the market. The software can be confusing and gives few options (compared to other types), but depending on your needs, it might work for you.Buyer - be aware. Hopefully your purchase will result in a perfectly constructed or modified unit that will give you years of good service. If you don't like to gamble, then you might consider another model or manufacturer.Good Luck.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pictures are awful", "Author": "A. husain \"amylaw\"", "ReviewID": "R3FK5I63IK49VC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times.

Defective charger?  Who knows...  Sure has sucked the pleasure out of this purchase though.  Going to have to send it back probably - $300+ is a lot to pay to have to deal with problems like this 1 week into ownership.UPDATE: If I could, I would increase my rating to 4 stars now.  Turns out, I was using the charger incorrectly.  As simple as you'd think a charger would be, I still managed to screw everything up (I think I was setting the camera on it while the camera was on, or some nonsense, and the battery was not charging - I think I read the manual and figured out the orange vs. green led light situation).Also, a few month later, the lens stopped powering in and out, and Canon did indeed fix it for me with no hassles.  I'd give their service dept 5 stars.
