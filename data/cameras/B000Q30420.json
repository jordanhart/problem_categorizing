{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good Camera", "Author": "J. Elser", "ReviewID": "R2HFIXPJBHA8OM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a point and shoot camera, this little gem packs a lot of advanced features. It's definitely not a DSLR but it's sure convenient when you want to conceal it and carry it with you in your pocket.Pros:1) Red-eye correction. No more red-eyes! It automatically fixes them.2) Image stabilization. Will correct your hand movements but will not stop action.3) Face Detection. Automatically finds and focuses on faces, and sets the proper exposure.4) LCD Screen. The 2 1/2 LCD screen is very high resolution.5) Lots of choices concerning picture quality and color.6) Image and video quality are very good for such a small camera.7) Optical viewfinder. Many cameras do not have this. It comes in handy when you do not want to use the LCD screen such as in theaters.8) Auto White Balance is much improved over the older Digic II processors.9) There is a manual setting where you can treak your photo settings. My preference is \"Positive Film,\" \"ISO 100,\" \"+1/3 exposure,\" \"flash on.\" The photos look fantastic.Cons:1) Noisy pictures with ISO settings over 200. (Pretty much what you get with any point and shoot camera.) Auto setting usually selects ISO 200, which is a little noisy. You're better off to go with ISO 80 or 100.2) Lens is wide enough for most purposes but it's definitely not a \"wide angle\" lens. There is some barrel distortion on the short end, meaning that straight lines, buidings, walls, etc, appear a little curved.3) Battery/SD Card Door can slide out and pop open easily.4) Cannot chose aperature or shutter speeds manually.5) No battery life meter. The LCD screen only displays a \"low battery\" warning.Bottom Line:This camera is a great little convenient camera, which is able to be concealed easily, and taken about anywhere because it easily slips into a purse or pocket. It's a great camera for taking indoor portraits with flash, as well as outdoor photos. It is not good at stopping action. Pictures of kids and pets running around will often be blurry because of the 1/60 sec. shutter speed. If you are needing to take low-light or action/sports photos, you would be better off purchasing a cheap DSLR. The only reason I don't give this camera 5 stars is because of the noise at higher ISO's.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "SD850 is faster then SD870", "Author": "newjourney2006 \"newjourney2006\"", "ReviewID": "R8CP2JVW6A763", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since October I have been researching to find the fastest (for fast moving small kids) low light (for evening indoor pictures) P&S; camera. I also know 99.9% of my prints will be 4x6 or 5x7, never bigger. And I want the red-eye reduction to work! I refuse to do touch-ups. Before I review, let me say a THANK YOU, to all who do post their reviews, because I have read them ALL, and a really big THANK YOU to Steves-Digicams and the CNET staff, who test and provide shutter speeds with flash.I have visited all local stores (BestBuy, CircuitCity, Target, Sears, Frys, Wolf, Office Depot & Max, Staples) multi-times to play with all cameras. Yes, I am retired and have the time. Plus I reviewed all CNET P&S; reviews from 1/25/07 to 11/15/07. I documented speeds of low contrast shutter and shot 2 shot with flash. From my research, the final candidates, based on low light speeds, were Fuji F40fd, Canon SD 800, 850, 870(*).* Interesting the Canon SD870 specs say it should be as fast as the 850, but comparing 850 vs 870 under store lights, at 2 different BB stores, the 850s were noticeable faster. I even had the salesperson swap the batteries, between the two, just to be sure.I purchased(Nov. 20,2007) the Fuji F45fd  and Canon SD850. I borrowed a CanonSD800 and had my Canon A610. Without question the Fuji was the fastest for evening indoors pictures. The Fuji was also the fastest for flash recharge. The Canons 800 & 850 did missed some small kids indoors action shots. All cameras had the same brand 2Gb 150x SD. After a week I printed all the shots, as 4x6s, from the same store, as different orders with different names, to ensure no pictures were mixed.The Canon SD800 had too many red-eyes. My old A610 was to slow for evening indoor shots. For outdoor daylight shots, all 4 cameras had the same speed results.Overall the 4x6s quality was the same between the Fuji F45 & Canon SD850. Comparing two very similar pictures, sometimes one would be a slight plus over the other, when you looked close up, then on another picture the other camera would be a slight better, but no real difference.The Canons do have a better long range zoom, at MAX zoom. If your need is for enlarge crops, the Canon AUTO pictures are taken at lower ISO, then the Fuji, see comparison below. I also tested the Canon SD850 with different ISOs in low light conditions. It was at the manual ISO 1600, that the Canon was as fast as the Fuji AUTO(ISO800), but the Canon(1600) pictures had higher noise.Here are the ISO results, taken with AUTO mode. I believe this to be very important to understand the results. The listed numbers will first be Fuji F40(F45) then Canon SD850.AUTO mode:Evening indoors F@800, C@200Outdoors 10pm Christmas Lights F@800, C@250Outdoors bright sun, at min zoom F@100, C@80Outdoors bright sun, at max zoom F@100, C@160Outdoors cloudy F@200, C@80Conclusion:NO one camera is perfect for all people or all conditions!!!!!Fuji F40/F45 is for those who want a fast, low light, small simple P&S; camera, whose prints will usually be normal size(4x6,5x7). It is the BEST P&S; available today, to capture fast moving kids indoors. I also appreciate the battery indicator.Canon SD850 is a great P&S; choice for more outdoors(vs indoors) or indoor adults (vs kids) pictures, or if you usually print pictures bigger then normal size.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Ultimately a great camera, but...", "Author": "David C. Mercil \"Buildalot\"", "ReviewID": "R30ZE7PQT089NS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After a few comments I decided to rewrite my review and clarify a few things.This is my 3rd Canon digital Powershot camera. My first was a S110 (2 mega pixle camera) that I bought in 2002. My second was a S410 (4 mega pixle camera) that my wife gave to me in 2004. (I'll refer to these as S series). In addition I've regularly used several profesional SLRs in the past including the Nikon D1-X.My new Canon Powershot SD850 is superior to my older two S series cameras in almost everyway. But, like everthing else it's not perfect.Minus 1 star:The camera seems to experiance increased barrel distortion (where the picture is sharp in the middle but fuzzy around the edges). This seems most noticable in daylight shots without a flash. For you experts out there; yes, I'm aware that barrel distortion is common on these types of cameras. I feel however that it is more noticable with this camera. You can test the affect for yourself if you shoot straight at a flat, textured surface such as a brick wall, etc. without a flash. Note that you may have to use a tripod to avoid camera shake. View the picture at 100% resolution, compare with other cameras and decide for yourself. My comparison was with my older S410 which had only half the resolution and much less noticable distortion.Minus 1/2 a star:The camera tells you the F/stop and shutter in the display, but does not let you change it. And, the camera loves the F2.8 setting (lens cranked wide open), especially in lower lit scenes whether you are using a flash or not, which most likely has something to do with the added distortion.Minus 1/2 a star: (other things)The power button that so many people have complained about is a little awqured but not something you can't get used to. The A/V out cover that a few others mentioned is fairly low quality and just seems to sit in place without anything really securing it. Also, it is difficult to take pictures without getting fingerprint smudges all over the LCD screen. My older S410 did not have this problem because the screen was much smaller and way out of the way of my thumb.One more note:The cameras rounded body is a mixed blessing. On one hand it looks cool, and fits in a pocket much easier. Unfortunately it is also much more diffiuclt to simply set it on objects when you are using the self timer. My older S series cameras were small boxes with flat bottoms and could be placed on uneven objects such as rocks with ease. Because this camera has a more rounded bottom doing that becomes much more of a balancing act. The longer protruding lens does not help much either. Small price to pay I guess..Overall it seems like a good camera, but the real test will come next week when I take it on its first trip.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Thomas Grimes \"Tom Grimes\"", "ReviewID": "R388LCKAU1PDMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th digital camera and I can honestly say that its by far the best.

Most recently I owned an SD700 IS, which I loved.  Unfortunately, it got caught by a wave at the beach so I had to replace it.  The SD850 IS does not disappoint.  It's essentially the SD700 IS with several added features including an extra 2 MP, support for SDHC cards, a new processor that automatically recognizes faces, time lapse video and some other cool lighting effects.The image quality is great and I haven't had any problems with the camera so far.  I really like the time lapse video feature.  It's pretty fun to set it up in the corner of the room for a couple of hours and watch all the action replayed at high speed.The camera itself is small enough to fit in my pocket and it feels sturdy.

I just want to point out a good alternative.  I ordered an SD850 but returned it because I found the Canon A570IS was almost the same as the SD850, but at almost half the price.  The only major differences are battery and size.  The lithium-ion battery on the SD850 allows many shots on a full charge and discharges very slowly.  The A570IS uses two AA batteries and traditionally the quick self discharge rate of NiMH batteries has given casual picture takers a big hassle.  But with the new low self discharge NiMH batteries like the Sanyo Eneloop, this is no longer an issue.  (I have a 4-year old Kodak digital camera and didn't use it often because of the battery problem but after I bought the eneloop batteries, it started to shine again.)  The SD850 and A570IS have similar width and height, but the A570IS is 0.65 inch thicker on the right-hand side because of the battery compartment.  But I see this as an advantage because it allows you to have a better hand grip while taking pictures.  The difference in the number of pixels (8MP for SD850 vs 7.1 MP for A570IS) is ignorable.  I did notice that one reviewer pointed out the A570IS is slower in processing image.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "As always...Canon is a winner !!!", "Author": "Richard Antczak", "ReviewID": "R31KG28IHV66JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buy it ...You'll like it !!!I've been a Canon Digital Camera user since November,1999 ( for those youngins out there, thats the first year digital cameras were availiable to the general public at a reasonable price )Prior to that, I have had Canon SLR's since 1977 ( I remember because it was the first real camera I bought with the money I earned in the summer cutting lawns ...a lot of lawns ) The Canon AE-1 cost $300.00 which was a lot of chicken in those days...Still have it ...still works 100%Anyway I digress.... plain and simple this is probably my 4th Canon point and shoot  ( I also have the Rebel SLR which I bought for $999 when introduced a few years back ) My most recent digital Canon was the 430SD...Had that for a good 3 years as it wasn't lost, stolen or broken...and did the job with no complaints...Well let me tell you...I should have upgraded 2 years ago.

I bought the camera priot to a trip out west to visit Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and other sites.  This meant that I needed a camera that could do well with various kinds of settings under different conditions and with a variety of compositions.  Whether it was a night shot of the Vegas lights, the Grand Canyon at sunset or Lake Mead on a sunny day, the camera performed flawlessly and produced just the shots I had hoped.  The camera also allows tweaking the color, lighting or other settings so that I can get the right color saturation or lighting that I want.  The Auto setting saves a lot of time and does a very fine job with those quick shots.  The manual setting allows me to be very creative and the zoom lens provides a wide range of lens lengths.

I couldn't believe I was paying such a seemingly-high price for a digital camera, but man it's worth it. My previous camera was just a 35mm Canon SureShot 130u that I bought in 2004, so I thought it was time for an upgrade. I trust Canon as the picture-quality has never disappointed me. I shopped around, did my research and decided that the Canon SD850 IS would be a good choice. Although many would consider me an amateur, I love taking pictures, as well as doctoring them in Photoshop, so finding a great quality digital camera to satisfy my needs was definitely a priority.Here's a list of what I love about the Canon SD850 IS:-Face Detection-Vibrant,true colors-Easy-to-use-Loading pictures on my computer is fast and easy-Image stabilizer - I literally shook the camera as I was taking a pic to test this out, and it performed wonderfully! The picture looked crystal clear!-GREAT zoom capabilities for a digital camera. I was a bit skeptical since I love how my 35mm takes pictures, but wow, this is a great zoom range for a compact digital camera.-Compact, lightweight-Crisp, clear LCD screen-An actual viewfinder above the LCD screen. Although the LCD screen may take precedence over it, I still like having it there, if not for more than sentimental value, it certainly makes the camera more versatile.Here's stuff I'm not too crazy about, but can life with:-As many people before me have said, the on/off button takes some getting used to...I wish Canon wouldn't have experimented with something so standard. To me it would be similar to taking the handles on a car door and moving them down to the middle of the door in a horribly awkward and untraditional location...but the on/off button on this camera would be more bearable.-Whenever I take a picture, I have to press down the button for a good couple of seconds, which I sometimes find annoying in comparison to my Father's Nikon Coolpix camera which takes pictures almost automatically.

I just wanted to make sure that I got the camera that was right for me.As part of the test, I took about 70 photos with each camera in various lighting conditions, indoor lighting behind, indoor lighting in front, outdoor, zoom, wide angle, etc.  Because I usually use only 4x6 prints, I printed all the photos in 4x6 prints at a local photo lab.  There was no post photo processing on any of the photos.  I just wanted to see the results right out of the camera so to speak.Thus, to me, the test was as real world as possible because that is how people use the camera, you don't shoot screens of color swatches, you shoot people, things, landscapes, grass, etc.  Printing it out at a photo lab let me see the pictures as best as they could be.  All cameras were set on full auto and no special modes were used for any of the shots.The results were very intersting but hardly surprising.  With the exception of a somewhat noticeable difference in the telephoto and zoom ranges, at a 4x6 size, there is essentially no discernable difference in the pictures generated by the Canon SD 850IS and the Canon SD 800IS.  There was no difference indoors, outdoors, or anywhere else.  This is not surprising, because the cameras are very very similar, use the same processor, and only differ in the lenses.The Panasonic was another story.  It regularly failed to perform, had zoom hunting, poor focus, fringing, etc. on the indoor shots.  Outside, with plenty of light, it performed very well and produced excellent photos, but because I don't shoot exclusively outside, that was a deal killer for me.  You basically cannot shoot anything moving indoors with the Panasonic camera.  Based on the reviews, I understood that the Panasonic had limitations, but did not realize how much the processor hobbled the camera's indoor performance.Here's the review for the SD 850 IS:PROS:FAST: Very fast.  Not quite as fast as the SD 800 IS, but faster than almost any other point and shoot digital camera you will find.  Considerably faster than the Panasonic.PROCESSOR: Excellent super sharp photos in a wide variety of conditions.LENS:  This is a very nice range lens with excellent edge to edge sharpness that performs very well in a variety of conditions.SIZE: very small, fits anywhere.  Marginally smaller than the SD 800 IS, which itself is a small camera.  The SD 800 IS and the SD 850 IS take different batteries because the SD 850 IS is marginally smaller.  Extremely pocketable.VIEWFINDER OPTIONS: Optical viewfinder, the screen is so good that you don't use this that often, but it is nice to know it is there for those really really sunny days (and they come up every so often).BATTERY: Battery life is exceptional.  Camera seems to go on for months with one battery (I think it is rated for 400+ shots, which is an astounding battery life for such a small camera).CONTROLS: I would say of the three cameras, this one had the best layout of controls.  The half hidden wheel on the back is an excellent design touch and the on/off button, while not where you would expect it to be, prevents accidental on/off switching.  A very well laid out camera from the ergonomic standpoint.  Also, the four way control pad has an external touch sensitive ring which is pretty cool (when it works well) but Canon maintains its highly regarded and often imitated control layout on this little gem.NEUTRAL:APPEARANCE: The looks of the camera.  I prefer black cameras as I used to own a film SLR and black cameras remind me of that beloved camera.  However, my wife seems to like the looks of this camera.CONS:LIMITED ZOOM: Would like a drop more zoom range, perhaps a 5x - 6x would be preferable.  The replacement model for this (890) has a 5x zoom, but from initial reviews, the 890's performance is not quite as good as that of this camera.FLASH: Flash is a little weak, but this is par for the course on a point and shoot.OPTICAL VIEWFINDER: Optical viewfinder is really small, is off center and not useful for every time composure on this camera, the camera is made to be used with the LCD on.Can't go wrong with either this or the SD 800IS, as they are essentially the same camera with different lenses, it just depends on whether you want a wide angle lens or not.Good luck with your shopping.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon 850IS", "Author": "Peter Liao", "ReviewID": "R1P6XTIFTT155S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for four months now, and I  very satisfied.

I've used the predecessor of the 850is the 700 and was impressed with the speed of most function compared to both the Sony and Nikon. I was leery of the proprietary batteries, so with the purchase of the camera, I bought an extra battery and have yet to need it while taking pictures. It is a good idea to have the extra power pack in any event.  If you start with a freshly charged battery,you probably won't need it. Picture quality is excellent and there are many modes available but the auto mode works fine for most instances. I love the ability to shoot video in such a compact camera. I own a miniDV camcorder but almost never carry it because of the extra bulk. With this camera, I can handle most of the situations  I want to capture of my two and a half year old son.  Manual modes are limited compared to a SLR, but this camera can travel unobtrusively anytime,anywhere. If you are looking for a digital camera with manual controls, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a camera that can always be with you to capture those spontaneous moments, this camea will fit the bill. The image stabilization definitely helps but don't expect every shot to be perfectly clear.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "great for the basic point and shoot photag", "Author": "jude", "ReviewID": "R1BTPA95NXU30Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "purchased camera for a trip to hawaii, and it was great.  unbelieveable picture quality, but not if you want to shoot action shots.  then you get a lot of blurry images, because the camera's reaction time is just too slow, even with a sandisk extreme 3 card.  that's my only complaint.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera !!!

In fact the S500 is still going strong, but the lens cover no longer closes :(  These are great little cameras, all of them!Just after getting this camera, my wife and I went on a cruise to Mexico, and took it and one of my Nikon DSLR's with us... I have to say, the images which came off of this camera were every bit as impressive (at any normal viewing distance) as those that came off of the Nikon.I consider myself and my wife to be fairly heavy users of our cameras, (on this four day trip we shot apx. 2700 images between the two cameras we took. About 250 of those were on this Canon SD850IS...Here are my observations:1. This camera, like my others is very sleek and portable and very rugged when stowed in the off mode. I carry mine in a $7 belt clip cellular phone case with a Velcro closure. (My others have lived in my pocket without a case, but I did not want to scratch the beautiful LCD on this new one since it is so large and I had no time to buy a screen protector) I also looked long and hard at the A730IS which my father bought for himself, because I wanted to run AA batteries, but in the end portability won out over convenience2. During this trip we took most of our images outdoors, in natural light (with daylight fill flash) and they came out great! I typically shoot this camera in manual mode with the following settings ISO 80 or 100, Flash ON or OFF (Never Auto), Evaluative Metering, IS Continuous, Superfine, Large... I deactivate bull crap such as digital zoom that I can do in Photoshop later, and rarely use the face recognition mode, etc.3. Overall I am very happy with this camera, if I have any complaints with it... it would be with the ergonomics and somewhat with the feature set as opposed to other canon models:Pluses:Great LCD, can't say enough good things about this LCD really great for checking pics after the shot.Still has optical viewfinder, this is nice to have on occasion though only about 85% view angle.Great looking images, especially at highest settings, just stay out of high iso or real low light situations.Very light weight and durable, so far :)Minuses:I hate the on/off switch, the location sucks for quick turn on...especially for those with fat fingers... my s500 was great for quick one handed turn on and shoot whereas this requires two hands to turn on without dropping it.Why did they have to hide the SD card in the came door with the battery? That door will get 2x the wear and tear from that placement :( They should have stuck with the s500 dual door arrangement.Speaking of SD... It sure would be nice if there were still any compacts out there for those of us who carry a DSLR most of the time. I love my s500 and almost bought another refurbished one because it uses compact flash, but I wanted image stabilization and a better LCD, otherwise I would have stayed with that model... This will never be my primary camera except for when I am just walking around town, so it does not have to be top quality or have high frame rate... but it would be nice if it could use the same memory cards as my DSLR and run off of the AA bats. that I carry for my Speedlight ...Speaking of ergonomics, why did canon have to cram all of the functions onto one hat switch? Why did they have to cram the wonderful panoramic stitch mode onto a menu rather than on the mode wheel, while taking away the dedicated playback/camera switch that I use constantly from my s500?The Japanese need to get out more and USE these cameras so that they will know what we really want... and the sad thing is that they are going further away from the proper ergonomics rather than getting closer. (And this is one of the best compact cameras out there today)Not wide angle enough lens... (I almost bought the SD870, but it does not have enough tele so I had to compromise somewhereFinal Thoughts:In the end, this camera is \u00bc\" thinner than my s500...has a far superior LCD and IS, but far inferior ergonomics to that camera... forces me to buy into yet another memory technology, and use yet another proprietary lithium-ion battery.Admittedly I do love the charger that canon has for that battery (Nikon could learn a lot about battery chargers for their DSLR's from these canon units) but I would much rather see this thing run off of 3 AAA batteries or 2 AA batteries depending on the voltage requirement... both are available in rechargeable form and easily located in alkaline form if the need arises.Let me have a choice (even if it costs $20-$50 more or is only available on the special titanium model...) to have Compactflash  or SD or dual capable (awesome) Give me a 24-135mm (35mm) lens for both wide and tele capability, plus a higher frame rate when the flash is disabled. Also, it would be cool rather than having all of these special scene modes if it had a wireless module one could buy that when installed allowed it to trigger Canon brand speedlights from their 35mm series (the add on flash for the Powershot series sucks) even if it only had a 15-25 foot range. Full manual control of the A series cameras would also be nice, why do the small cameras have to be so automatic? I would have bought the A730IS if it were more pocktable...but I had to choose.Trust me canon, pro's would pay more for a compact camera with features like these, and ergonomics that would allow one handed operation...we don't care about megapixels...If you are looking for a fun very portable camera and don't need wide angle or high frame rate, buy this model in a heartbeat, if you need wide angle buy the SD870IS...  If you don't need it to fit in your pocket on a daily basis, look hard at the A730IS which has more tele zoom and runs on AA batteries and is cheaper, even after you buy 4 AA Re-chargeables and a good charger !! (My dad loves his)Also while you are buying this camera or any other compact model from canon, do yourself a favor and get a high quality/high capacity memory card like this :SanDisk 2 GB SDSDX3-2048-901 Extreme III SD Memory Card (Retail Package)  You will never look back, and your images will always be there with no worries, unlike with crummy third party cards...RMG", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera rocks", "Author": "bluzan", "ReviewID": "R3GPXE2U551JEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera right before a trip to Europe.

The SD850 upgrades this with face detection, 8MP from 5MP, image stabilization, 1600 max ISO from 400 ISO, DIGIC III image processing, multiple scene settings, and many display/menu additions.Most of my pictures are photoshopped afterwards, so what really matters is the quality of the original photo. I can admit that I am truly disappointed that I can take as good of a photo with the 4-year-old S500 as with the SD850 IS. However, the S500 was a pretty good camera, so the SD850 IS is still better than most other cameras out there.I've taken the same photos using the S500 and the SD850 and looked at them in comparison. Here are my findings:Why the SD850 is an improvement over the S5001. Secure digital cards are smaller than the old compact flash cards2. It's so much faster when reviewing photos in playback mode.3. The menu is much prettier and easier to explore4. The display is so much bigger. (The optical viewfinder is basically gone. I can't image looking through that tiny, vestigal scope anyways.)5. Multiple scene modes are available. However, they're over-rated. Don't expect them to take the photo for you on their default setting. You'll still need to adjust the ISO, flash, and other settings.6. 8MP. w00t! Seriously, the extra megapixels probably won't matter (except for outdoor/well-lit environments) because the image quality is much worse than can be displayed by the megapixels. Of course, if you always use a tripod, that's a different story, and you should probably get a pro-camera.7. Lastly, it's newer!! Also, it has ridiculously high reviews on CNET and every other website, which means bragging rights. -.-\"Why it's not an improvement over the S500:1. The overall stability of the SD850IS decreased slightly so that image stabilization barely makes up for it to match the stability of the old S500.2. They're practically the same size.3. The flash still sucks. But I gotta admit, when does a non-fill-in flash not suck on any camera. The bad thing is, the camera auto-flashes more often than before, and there still is no manual fill-in flash. Night-scene mode is the closest alternative.4. Whenever I switch between modes (automatic, manual, scene), all my settings for that mode are reset, including NO-FLASH. Just an annoyance, especially when taking quick photos.5. High ISO is still grainy. I don't think DIGIC III makes any progress to reduce noise.6. The power button is small and difficult to reach.7. Outdoor photography still looks great (if not better/brighter), but indoor photography hasn't increased in stability, despite image stabilization.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "I'm happy with this purchase", "Author": "Mom of 2", "ReviewID": "R2FRWS3EJ3W2G2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera within a few days of it's release.

I have tried Nikons, Sonys, Panasonics and Olympus', but I always come back to a Canon compact camera.  They simply have it nailed.  Many others can do a good job and equal the performance and output of the Canons, but for me they can't hold a candle to one of these.I think for me it's almost always 2 things.  Canon seldom fails to have at least one camera in their product line with a viewfinder.  They are not perfect, they are not accurate, but they do serve a very important purpose in many situations.  Low light, hand held, no flash images (even with IS) have a much higher success rate if the camera is held to the face and supported in a traditional manner.  Also, sometimes the LCD could be a distraction, or the battery may be low.  With these new, beautiful LCD's, it's tough to use that little viewfinder, though.  The other thing for me is the user interface.  Canons from 5 or 6 years ago interface with the user in the same logical and familiar fashion, so moving between models is easy.You do have to move up the food chain to get full manual control, longer lens and some other things, but these are not intended to fill every need.  The images these things produce are ever more amazing since the 2 or 4MP days, yet the images have a familiar look and have always responded well to post processing if you go that way, or they look great right off the card if you don't.Having said all of the above, it is but my opinion.  I would argue that it is an experienced and informed one, but it is still my opinion.  So, I would recommend this one over anything from the competition in this class.  I cannot tell anyone that this particular camera is hands down better than something from the other guys because (among the major camera brands) there really are no terrible choices.  It's all about preferences, pricing, look, feel.  I will say you are missing out if you don't get something and start making pictures with it, and I think this is the way to go.

Whatever camera you wind up getting, make sure it has optical stabilization. Even with a steady hand, IS allows for much sharper images.For my wife and I, another key feature is having an optical viewfinder, using this is much more natural and much quicker than trying to line up a shot via the LCD back panel. Few cameras now have optical viewfinders, support this dying feature!It gets only 4 stars, for three reasons: 1) a little expensive for what it is, 2) while 4x optical zoom is nice, 16x \"digital zoom\" is pure crap, so is the higher ISO -- you only get quality when you stick to optical zoom and lower ISO settings.And the third reason?

To provide minimally adequate camera storage you need at least a 2 GB memory card.  So unless you get a free memory add on , you must also immediately plan to purchase such an additional card.(2)  More serious is that the Canon camera memory card download interface appears to be incompatible with the Microsoft Vista Windows Image Acquisition software.  This week I wrote and spoke with Canon support.  Neither resolved the problem.  Basically the only way in which I can access my pictures is via my older backup system, a Windows XP cpmputer.  After some time Canon told me that others had reported a similar difficulty and finally indicated that the recommended solution was that I should purchase a separate memory card reader!  While the additional cost would be minimal, that solution is quite inconvenient.  It would require removing the camera memory card every time an image transfer is performed.  Some solution.(1/11/08 update)  I just spoke with Canon customer care again, and again was told that the Canon Microsoft Vista USB port incompatibility problem could not be fixed.

I bought this camera for my wife who's previous camera died. To put it mildly, her cousin accidently hit it with her elbow and knocked it onto the concrete pavement. Both the camera and the memory card died. That was a HP 735 (2.3 Megapixels). I priced around and as always, I check Amazon. (Sadly they charge tax now because the New York State legislature wanted their hands in the cookie jar (honeypot) and earn some revenue on the very popular Amazon.com.This camera is amazing. It takes quick pictures, and the preview shows how great the pictures can be. The colors are rich and the face detection is right on. I found it funny that the camera was detecting the faces on the T.V. when we took it out of the box and was trying to learn about its many features. Another good plus for this camera is that it eliminates red eye. My wife loves to take pictures and she sighs when she develops her pictures and everyone on the pictures look like red-eyed vampires. Thats a thing of the past with this camera. The camera is a fast loader so be ready when you turn on the camera. It is very quiet and I was looking for the noise that many reviewers had written about. When we took pictures, it was quiet as though it had a silencer. Also many people had stated that it takes a long time for it to snap a shot. To us, it was quick and the shots were amazing. The options on the side of the camera (the dial- previewing pictures for example) and the power button as many people felt was a nuissance didn't bother us. Both are in good spots and our fingers never hit them accidentaly. The life of the battery was certainly longer than we thought. We had it on for a few hours and it was still running. Our former digital camera was a nightmare. After an hour it was already down to one bar. We didn't mind that the power meter wasn't present on the very sleek and sexy 2.5 LCD screen. I guess we were scared to look lol. Too many, i would think that the most important information on the viewscreen would be how many pictures you can take and their quality as well as the preview od the picture.My wife is not a profesional photgrapher but she loves taking pictures. It ranges from sunsets to weddings. The pictures are outstanding and her family are amazed at how great the pictures look and come out. To us, there are no \"cons\" for this camera. We are delighted and anyone who likes taking pictures and is in need of a new camera, this is a fantastic one.Amazon was terrific also. Right after I placed the order for this camera, the price went down and Amazon gave me a refund on the price difference. I also ordered it right before July 4th, so I did 2-day shipping (Ordered it on July 1st). To my amazement it actually arrived the next day. What other place can you order a product, click 2-day shipping, pay for 2-day shipping, and you end up getting it the next day. Not bad for overnight shipping and next day delivery. I was so shocked, we weren't even home when it arrived 9the first attempt).

This makes it easy for evryone to use and the program modes does work.  It does give good photographs with the provided settings.  However, I like to set the camera in the manual mode, where I can set my F-stop at about 4 - 5.6.  This would give me a good depth of field, especially when shooting indoor.  With those settings, I was able to capture some excellent photos during our Christmas vacation.  Outdoor photography with this camera is great.  It does capture the color, white balance very well.  An additional feature this camera has is the ability to detect and focus several objects simulataneously, which would give better lighting to a group photos.  The movie taken with this camera is good for outdoor but still noisy for indoors.  One additional feature that this camera has is the ability to take photos that will fit a 1920X1280 frame, which will fill your HDTV screen.  This photo frame is very good for viewing photos using a HDTV without having black bars or stretching.The only con that I can find for this camera and that is the reason I did not give it an excellent (and maybe this is me) is that the photograph quality is sharp, color rendition is good but not smooth.

Now, I like to capture ambient lighting and shadowing so a flash would ruin the effect I'm after. All of the other Canon P&S; cameras I've owned weren't at all good at this kind of shot, but the SD850 is remarkably better. Even the night shots are greatly improved. I use a 4 gig Sandisk SDHC Ultra II storage card and haven't experienced any problems with camera processing speed. Did I mention that this camera HAS an optical viewfinder? I'm also very pleased that this Canon has improved features that you can experiment decently with, so that you don't always have to put everything on auto. On the down side, all P&S; cameras are a little slow shot to shot and this is no different. I've also noticed purple fringing in certain circumstances, but the picture was fine.

Luckily, the very effective image stabilizer helps me to keep the ISO speed low.Build quality is terrific.  The camera is very small but feels exceptionally solid, with a metal tripod mount, and a solid feeling door over the battery compartment.

I wanted a compact camera for quick snapshots, so I picked up a Sony DSC-T70, but found the quality of the shots completely unacceptable, after some research, I came to the SD850.Pros:- Face Detection- Good imagestabilisation- Decent indoor photos for a compact camera- Good Noise filtering in low light (with the caveat, that I would rather have some noise than have the picture look smeared)- Good zoom function- Great macro for a compact- Great interfaceCons:- Some fuzziness in the corners of pictures- Power button can be hard to get to- Would rather have had it use AA's like the S2 IS (I have yet to have any batter problems when out and about but AA's are just too convenient)- Can't turn off the noise filter to post process the photos on my own.Bottom Line:I would recommend this camera to anyone.

Many options are buried too deep in the menu system and takes too many finger clicks to access.  Even simple settings that were easily accessible on my previous model are now more difficult to get to.  The automatic white balance is still very poor.

It makes some difference but ultimately the built-in lens is pretty slow so you still have to use a flash most of the time when you're shooting indoors.I really like the larger LCD screen and it's been amazingly scratch proof.Overall, the camera takes very good pictures and the small size is great.

However, having some experience with digital cameras helped.  The manual was well laid out and I had no trouble finding the information I needed.I love the stabilizing feature. I was amazed at the quality of the pictures taken out the window of our moving car. I was also please with the quality of the handheld pictures taken at night or in low light, especially of the 4th of July fireworks.It is smaller and lighter than I expected and took some getting use to as my previous camera was larger and heavier. It sliped nicely into my pocket for convenience.The LCD is large and easy to see. It also seemed to be easy on batteries.  I was concerned I would need a back-up since I planned to be away from an area where I could re-charge for an extended period of time.

It takes great pictures and absolutely amazing macros. Nothing rivals this camera's macros in a point and shoot. The flash is far better than any camera I've used.

Sure more settings would be nice, changing the f-stop would be great.Overall this camera takes great pictures. In full light and outdoors, the pictures are always incredible. Inside, it's touchy, you usually need a flash otherwise you'll get blur. The lack of flash control makes it hard. At times in low light it will take too bright of a flash and overexpose your picture whiting out colors. It would be nice if they could have a setting for high/low/auto flash. There are new models out that are certainly somewhat better but this camera is very solid. It's also a great price for what you get.

The camera is small enough to fit in your pocket, yet takes incredibly clear pictures, even with the digital zoom. The image stabilization makes a HUGE difference in picture clarity. Some had complained about the power button but I find it a bonus that the button is not accidentally pressed. High quality SD cards make a substantial difference in shot to shot time. I am using SanDisk Extreme III cards and found them to be worth the extra money. There is a vast assortment of extra features on the camera, most of which I haven't had reason to use yet. The ones I have used have been most useful, especially the photostich setting used with the software that comes with the camera. I have been able to effortlessly create beautiful panoramas. If using the flash when zoomed way in with macro mode the lens will cast a shadow, but I have been able to get good pictures by just moving the camera an inch or two further away.

The small size is great, nice sturdy construction.  picture quality is very good, ISO settings over 400 tend to get grainy but this is fairly common for most of these types of cameras.  It lacks some of the manual settings like Aperature and shutter priority but has quite a few automatic settings like Portrait, Landscape and others.  The 4x optical zoom is nice since many other cameras of this type only have a 3x zoom.  Battery life is good, although lack of a battery life indicator is a little unhandy, by the time it tells you your battery is low, you only have a small amount of time, I would advise buying an extra battery (the aftermarket ones work great and are much cheaper than the canon batteries).

I think the Digic III does a better job with auto-setiings than the Digic II in my Rebel XTi.  I found that the XTi auto system always cranked up the ISO and F-stop and the 850 does not do that.  It actually takes a lot of pictures in the lower iso (80-200) settings in auto mode, so as long as your subject is stationary the photos look great and have good color saturation.  I am also impressed by the video quality.  I was looking for a high quality ultra-compact camera and I feel like that is really what I got with this.  I chose the 850 over the 870 because I thought the extra focal length of the 850 was well worth the trade-off with the wider angle of the 870.  I am not sure how usable the 870 is wide open as the darkening in the corners of the 850 at full wide is definately noticeable and I would be suprised if the 870 was able to escape this problem and be wider yet.  Good wide angle lenses usually have a lot of glass (diameter) out front to prevent this from happening.

It had to be compact, ease of use, have enough megapixels for decent prints and affordable.As a compact camera, the Canon PowerShot SD850 IS 8.0 MP Digital Elph Camera fits the bill. It could easily fit in my coat pocket, small purse, or large pant pocket. I do allot of cycling with friends and family during the warm season. I would normally take with me a disposable camera and shoot while on the bike. The camera is small enough to be held with one hand while riding. The lanyard on the camera gives it extra security when it is looped around your wrist.The controls are easily reached by your thumb and index finger. I also, like the feature of the view finder when you don't want to look through the LCD display to save on battery life. On startup, the camera is quite fast. No more than a second and it's ready to go taking pictures. There are the normal preset modes such as Party, Night, Landscape, Museum, etc. My favorite is the Aquarium setting, no more flash to bounce off the glass. I used it while on vacation at one of the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums and the white balance on the photos were good. I think the ISO can go up to 800 or more but, don't go above 400 unless you want to see some noise on your images.8 megapixels you could get up to 11x14 size prints on high quality settings. The control menu even shows you the print size of the images to choose from. Normally, 4x6 prints is good enough. Think about it with a compact camera you're not shooting for a fashion magazine or fine art photography. You're shooting events with the family or friends, so 4x6 prints are normally what you're going to use. You can set it to take at a higher setting for large group shoots, but keep in mind that it takes up allot of storage space on the card. Speaking of memory cards, it comes with a 32 MB card to get you started. I would suggest to buy a more higher capacity card, 2 GB should be enough. Your taking snap shots and that means allot of photos that need to be stored, plus you don't know when you'll be able to get it off the card and onto your computer.At around $250 it was well with in my budget.

The camera warns you when your shutter speed is too low so you can increase ASA or use flash. If you want speed insert an Ultra II or Ultra III card for the fastest downloads. This helps when shooting rapid fire and video.The scene modes help much even though manual mode allows for lots of customization of shooting procedures.

So far, that's been true.Excellent things about this camera:* Decent zoom - 4x Optical and the digital zoom is not bad all.* Flash control - I like controlling the use of the flash (and battery power), so it's nice to have this ability conveniently located on the back of the camera.* Intuitive design - The system menus are very easy to figure out and utilize. The overall design of this camera lends itself easily to those intimidated by newer technology, while still having plenty of tweakable options that more advanced users like to play around with.* Manual and Auto Shooting - Both have their pros and cons, but it's nice to have a choice in how you want your image shot.* Speedy!! - In good natural light, this cam snaps a pic, processes it, and displays the image very quickly...more importantly, it captures what you saw when you pressed the shutter button. Using the flash there's usually a slight delay in capturing what you see in the viewfinder, but this true of most digital cameras.* Perfect size - Some digital cams can be clunky and odd shaped. This is perfectly sized to fit in a pocket, purse, or back pack.* Macro feature - Always nice to have, especially for people that will use this for business purposes or people who need a cam to take close-up, detailed pics.* Rechargeable battery and charger - I was little hesitant about using a proprietary battery -- since my other cam used AAs that you can buy cheaply anywhere -- but so far the battery hasn't even gotten close to needing a recharge. That said, if you're planning on taking this on a trip overseas you might look into buying an extra battery or buying a converter/adapter for using the recharger with the different shaped outlets in another country.I've had this camera for about a month and I've taken close to 300 pictures and I've been impressed with most of them.

Made sure that it was totally dried out before using it again and it still hasn't missed a beat.

I am not a picture taking person, but I wanted to document my first trip to the United Kingdom. Trust me, I barely knew what I was doing as I didn't do more than skim through the owners manual (a mistake). However, all of my pictures came out wonderfully. I mean they are lead crystal clear. Even blown up on my laptop, they retain their sharpness. I took many shots of London's famous double deck buses while moving to see which ones would be keepers. All shots of the buses are as if they are frozen sharply in place.I had it set on auto for most of my trip. All of my pictures are out door shots, from early morning to mid evening. My night time shots on Bayswater Street are just as crisp as my daytime shots in Paddington Station and Kensington Park. Well, Paddington Station is inside technically.All shots came out beyond my minimum satisfaction expectations. I don't get some reviewers complaining about blurry still shots. Maybe reading the manual more deeply would have prevented this issue. Or despite the highest manufacturing standards, some stinkers get through the process. Except for Paddington Station, I didn't take any in door close up people shots. So I really can't comment much on its performance shooting people indoors regarding issues of red eye, poor lighting shots and such.I saw QVC presenting a Kodak 14 mega pixel digital camera today. They showed how sharp pictures taken with it are against lower mega pixel shots. The Kodak shots at 14 mega pixels didn't appear to be any more sharp than my shots at 8 mega pixels are! Granted, I was looking at the Kodak shots through my non HD TV and some things may have been lost in how sharp the pictures really were. After blowing the pictures up to say poster size, I can imagine my camera's shots losing ground against shots with 6 more mega pixels to spread around.The only glitch I ran into is for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to get a 4X zoom shot. All I could find on the menu is 3X zoom maximum. One of my main decision points in picking this camera over the Cannon Power Shot 770 (with only 3X zoom) is its 4X zoom feature.Oh yes. One other aspect of this camera is an issue. It has none, zero, nada internal memory. As I recall, the 770 has 32meg of internal memory. I knew this when I brought it and thought it wasn't much of an issue. When you run out of room on your card and there are sweet shots you can't take unless you sacrifice some existing shots...its an issue! Lesson learned. I just ordered a 4gb professional level memory card.On the lighter side of what's important, this camera feels substantial, without being heavy. It feels like you have something of quality in your hands instead of a camera brought at a flea market. The rechargeable battery with the James Bond gadget like charger is appreciated over having to buy batteries repeatedly.Before the Christmas holiday, I'll study the manual more to make better use of everything thats under this fine camera's hood.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, one flaw...", "Author": "Toty", "ReviewID": "R3PS8G37IP3W25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for over a year now, and I have used it in many conditions: underwater with its underwater case, under low light conditions (interior and exterior), for moving subjects etc...

I take quite a lot of macrosoof flowers, forgs etc... in which cases I need the flash or the pictures will be blurry. Macro and flash on this camera don't work very well together especially if you are very close to the subject: the lens and the flash in the front of the camera are too close and you will have a black shadow in the lower right corner of the picture (which can be cropped in most cases).

I took a lot of pictures with it and can say that outside in daylight it takes great pictures.  Maybe even better than my G6. However, inside and in situations where you need a flash it leaves a bit to be desired.  First the flash is on the upper left hand corner of the camera so it is easy to block the flash with your finger when taking pictures.  Also as this is a smaller camera the flash is limited so don't expect any great pictures at any distance.  The flash is just not strong enough to cover much area.

When I looked on line at the Canon's, this particular unit attracted me so I asked my son what he thought of it.  He said he had the SD750 and he took it on his trip to cruise in Europe last year and he was very impressed with it...and his pictures proved it.I've really been impressed with its features including the fact that the zoom is one of the best in any point and shoot and it also does macro shots which really impressed me.  Further, one can take a series of shots in a panning sequence and the software that comes with it will allow the photographer to \"stitch\" the photos together to make a panoramic photograph.  I've taken the shots but I haven't used the software yet but this feature is pretty extraordinary for a point and shoot.  Further, it takes a standard size memory card (for this type of camera) but it can also take the newer SD cards (which I learned after I purchased it).The only thing I thought was poor about it was the memory card that came with the camera.  It's a 32M card and in the true quality mode of picture taking only allows for about 14 shots (more in a less quality picture taking selection).  I went out and bought two 2G cards that allows for over 400 pictures in quality mode.And one more thing I've been impressed with and that's the battery.  At first I wasn't sure about being happy that the battery is a \"special\" battery that needs to be recharged rather than the over the counter (replaceable) type that many point and shoots use today.  However, I charged the battery when I got it and I'm still using the camera after taking about 100 pictures and many of them using the flash and I still haven't recharged the battery.It's a great little camera with lots of good features found on more expensive cameras.

I got the camera and a few days later took it to Montana for a wedding. It was small enough to fit in my evening bag, yet powerful enough to take pretty good pictures of mountains. The zoom isn't huge, but for a compact camera, it's decent. The image stabilization worked well - I had fewer blurry pictures than with my larger Olympus that doesn't have image stabilization. And yes, I did use the viewfinder several times in the super bright sun.I've used it since and was able to capture some amazing pictures of rainbows over the prairie, and some pretty wicked storm clouds in the Midwest, using normal AUTO settings without the flash.Bottom line: A great camera at a great price.

I found some free software on line that converts the movies down to a more manageable emailable size. I dropped the camera on pavement once (lens was retracted fortunately) and it still works fine.  Just get a very small portable battery charger and extra battery from Amazon and this camera is GREAT. I wish I could change my rating to 4 stars.I'm weary from trying out 4 cameras - Canon A570, SD1000, SD850 and SD870. I actually had decided to go with A570 - but it rejected 2 sets of hi-quality rechargable batteries and screen display was low resolution and hard to see - not much better than my trusty A85 that I own now - just bigger.  Overall, I found the A570, SD850 and SD870 to take the best quality pics - but I really don't like the SD850 layout of the on/off switch and the awful \"dial\" of play/camera modes - ICK. That dial is way too small - almost too small for me and I have little \"bird\" hands - my husband and his big \"man hands\" will have to learn to adjust to SD850.  But...for these reasons...I actually decided to go with SD870 because I loved its layout and larger LDC screen and same quality pictures. I was about to return the SD850 and call it a day, when the dealbreaker killed it for me on SD870 - if you wear polarized sunglasses, the SD870 screen is useless outdoors - honest.  It must be the anti-glare coating that SD850 or SD1000 do NOT have. They only have anti-reflection.It may be hard to believe from this review, but I did keep the SD850.  The pictures printed are great - a definite step above my A85, and I wanted an upgrade in picture quality, not the same quality as A85, which is basically what the SD1000 delivered.  The great things about the SD1000 are its layout of play/camera button, on/off switch etc. -much better than SD850 - and I also love the size and feel of this camera.  I like the \"boxiness\" better than the SD850 or SD870 by far.  The LCD screen is outstanding on SD1000 and SD850 - A570 was not good and SD870 didn't work with polarized sunglasses.  I'm strictly a P&S; person and use \"Auto\" nearly all the time and rarely use viewfinder.One other word of caution on SD850 - I do notice a bit of dark corners on low light indoor flash pictures.  I'm not happy about it, but will have to find a way to work around it I guess.

My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, \"too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics.\" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos \"not zoomed\". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and \"sony Style\".", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "Barbara Conway", "ReviewID": "RHLGM4SX0EHFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good size.

I've had this camera for over a year now and I still LOVE it (which is saying a lot for me).

OH THERES A DIFFERENCE. another great feature of the 850, similar to the 600. (and this is very convenient) is that it quick and easy to review your pictures from an OFF setting. you can select the PICTURE REVIEW ICON and go stright to the pictures with out having the lens pop out than selecting review. that saves battery life too!!! MY NEWER CANON S95 DOESNT HAVE THAT FEATURE!! I HATE HOW THE LENS OPENS IF YOU JUST WANT TO REVIEW PICTURES!. CANON THOUGHT ABOUT THE customers on the 600 and 850.-also the VIDEO is GREAT!! 30fps! that's a good deal! shoots good footage! (if your good enough, HA) and with the video you can shoot in many settings of WHITE-BALANCE like in still pictures, change the speed and quality of the shooting. it has fast moving mode! which is awesome(but beware the quality does reduce on that one). COLOR ACCENT!!! COLOR SWAP! YEAH!  now this isnt 1080P to mind you! if you want to shoot professional! GO BY A CAMCORDER!!! GEEZ people these dayz.-okay also just to let you know how great this camera was! and still great to this day! it's aug, 2011 right now and this baby still has it! so good, i purchased 4 of these. well one i broke when it fell. another i lost. and i just bought two to back me up. i didnt like the other sd's, 800 870, 1000 1200 1400. yeah. didnt serve my needs.-OH YES AND ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE WHICH I DISCOVERED A WHILE BACK, IS THAT THIS CAMERA IS COMPATIBLE WITH HD CARD (high defintion), HC CARD(high capacity cards), XS CARDS (extra capacity cards or whatever). top quality memory cards!! HOWS THAT!!! BAM!  the only flaw i have with this camera is, well i grew up in arizona, and i'm sorry to say this camera isnt SANDPROOF, i got a little sand in the lens zooming lens area. BUT NOOTHING IS SANDPROOF! not even camping tents!! WELL ENJOY HAHA!-well to upgrade into todays society i bought the CANON S95- BECAUSE IT HAS A 2.0F-4.7F LENS.

Seeley \"Sweet Orange Nectar\"", "ReviewID": "R2U59HXAYMXX3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera before Christmas based on the glowing reviews on this and other sites.  This was a replacement for a Kodak 7430 point and shoot which I was very happy with, but which had died after taking 1000s of pictures.Do not believe the hype with this camera.  I spent about five hours trying to decipher the TWO manuals required to learn how to operate this camera.  That is far too long for a camera of this type.  I have since shot at least 1500 pictures if not more and the results have not improved.For a point and shoot the picture quality is average at best except in the most optimal of conditions.  There is an auto setting that produces horrible picture quality in any light condition.  Outdoor pictures can be crisp if you use one of the presets and you have crisp light.  Otherwise, subjects are fuzzy and the backgrounds are exceptionally flat.If you plan on taking pictures indoors, forget about getting a good shot of a group of people. Indoor pictures produce red eye in nearly every light condition unless you are within 5-7 feet and the person is looking directly at the Red Eye Reduction light.  As for the flash, it is totally worthless beyond 5-7 feet which is far less than my old Kodak.The software provided to clean up the Red Eye is occasionally useful, but often is unable to correct the red eye in the pictures.  I switched to Picasa, which works significantly better.  Now I am spending about 10 minutes per picture to manipulate the image to bring it up to a printable quality.The company could care less and provides possibly the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  They essentially laughed at me when I called to complain.  They did provide a few suggestions, none of which produced any better results.I am generally happy with the video capability, but beyond that this camera has simply not been worth the money.  I am sorry I didn't return this camera when I still had the chance.
