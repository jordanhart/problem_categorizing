I received this camera kit only 9 days after ordering it and that's at an APO AE address. The box arrived in perfect condition. All the items are brand new, original packaging. I've already charged up both batteries and taken a few test shots which are crystal clear (it is dual voltage). This is my first Digital SLR camera of this level so I'm reading through the manual and learning about it's features and settings options. Please forgive my lack of technical knowledge-I chose this camera kit because the camera body and both lenses were so highly reviewed on multiple sites. The sling backpack that came with it has smooth zippers, looks nice and appears to be well made. It's much larger than what you need for just the camera w/ 2 lenses but I'm glad I have the bag & will find use for it! I always read reviews and since this particular item didn't have any I decided to take a chance- I'm very pleased with my experience with this seller so far.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,114.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 14 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm II IS Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <5> Battery Charger for LP-E8 + <6> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter + <8> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <9> PD DSLR Sling Backpack + <10> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<11> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <12> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <13> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <14> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Backpack + Filters + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F1440eRyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAXG5IQ"}}
