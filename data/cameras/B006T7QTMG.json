{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Adequate for the Price", "Author": "CO772ER@HKG", "ReviewID": "R1F07BGWPFS5NV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just want to say beforehand, if you are considering this camera keep expectations in line with what you're paying. This is a bargain-priced point-and-shoot camera, so its functionality is quite basic. You get what most digital cameras nowadays come standard with. These include image stabilisation, various scene modes (auto, beach, indoors, night, portrait, etc), high megapixel count (10+, which is all that most people need, while this camera has 16MP) and optical zoom (8x for this camera). Having said that, I think this is actually a pretty good camera. I have a quality Canon powershot camera, and this Fuji JZ250 takes pictures that are just as good, if not a bit better. Granted, my Canon model is from 5-6 years ago. Image blur becomes an issue if you're shooting in low-light, without flash, and your hands tremble. But that's pretty much what you'd expect from most point-and-shoot cameras, expensive or not. Pictures can appear grainy as well if lighting is particularly inadequate. In daylight or good lighting I have not had blur issues like the previous reviewer. Pictures are quite sharp. I do have to note though, colours don't seem to be as vibrant as that taken with my mother's Panasonic Lumix. But then again, that was a pricey model, and what I have is a bargain Fuji. But don't get me wrong, my pictures are still what I'd consider adequate. Not bad at all.I do enjoy the 8x optical zoom. And as advertised, even with the zoom at 8x, the image stabilisation works well. I trembled my hands to test it, and the pictures still were blur-free. I tried it with low lighting, but there was blur as expected. Under these conditions however, as long as you're doing your level best to keep your hands still, the image stabilisation will work fine.And lastly, this camera is capable of shooting HD video. This is a VERY NICE feature. I filmed while walking through my apartment and outside and am pleased with the result.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good little inexpensive camera!", "Author": "Picture Lady \"Babs\"", "ReviewID": "RF0APA939U7HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a camera that is inexpensive I was pleasantly surprized!  There definitely is a learning curve.  My first pix were not good.  The important thing is to follow directions - make sure you hold the button down only half way to focus on the subject.  THEN, snap the picture.  Once you get used to doing this, your pictures will be beautiful!After having an expensive point and shoot camera I could hardly believe that one can get so much for so little money.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "good value,adequate performance", "Author": "K. J. Arbitman", "ReviewID": "R3J3MQY1EBLZJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am mystified by the poor reviews of this product. I purchased mine recently at a bargain price, with the intention of using it as a travel camera, in addition to my more expensive digital outfits. I have now tested it extensively, and it has performed very well, under most circumstances. Please note, that when you cram 16 megapixels onto a small sensor, you will get a very noisy image above ISO 400, so keep that in mind. Even with automatic lens motion suppression, at extreme telephoto lengths picture blur may occur if the camera is not braced.I have found that the lens is sharp, and the 8X from wide to telephoto is very usable...without in-camera processing, you will get some distortion at wide-angle, as was seen with film, and sometimes quite charming in effect.Yes, there is a yellow caste to the images on the display, but the images on your computer will be quite accurate.Novices to digital photography might try the program mode, which gives you access to the menu, which with one click gets you a choice of ISO,color, and white balance. In shooting mode, a click on the 4-way controller gets you flash modes, and exposure control.  These will help you control the color and look of your pictures, just like an expensive and heavy SLR, which is much to Fujifilms credit.In summary, I find the camera to be well built, have a sharp lens, take decent, and sometimes surprisingly good pictures, and be easy to use.My only complaint is that Fuji has decided to keep up with the megapixel race, and cramming 16 MP onto a small sensor hinders its low light (high ISO) performance.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good outdoor, lousy indoor", "Author": "how to get ahead", "ReviewID": "R190JIDSZRZLFO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this at Costco because it was on sale and I trusted the Fuji name.

It is a nice little camera for items that basically don't move. This is NOT the camera for moving objects, movies, concerts & other low light situations. Disappointed with it's \"HD\" video quality (image & sound) & zooming as well. The zoom is not smooth & thus distracting as you're trying to move in & out.My family & I are familiar with point & shoots (mainly Canons) & spent time going through & trying all it's settings. On the upside, its Lithium (NP-45A 3.7v) battery has made it through four rock concerts (recharged after each one - takes about an hour) one of which was 3 hours. We're usually near or at the stage & thus the camera is usually left on at the ready for a good portion of the event (we avg 250-350 pics & a few videos). It's bittersweet as it was a gift & hoped it would be an upgrade (mp & zoom) from my older camera.  I concur with what the others have said, you can do better. With that said, I'm off looking for a new camera while my old camera remains my go to guy.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stop distribution of this train wreck!", "Author": "PRM253", "ReviewID": "RLO4I3E7LWH3H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Similar to the other reviews, we had gotten this camera at Costco, but it time after time does not come through.

We are lucky enough to have had this camera when we had seemingly thousands of recent family events. The bridal shower, the birthdays, the wedding, the celebrations, all blurry.
