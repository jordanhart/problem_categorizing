{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A very nice DSLR", "Author": "D. Wells \"Lawnman\"", "ReviewID": "R2AK1CH03BI6DJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for 6 weeks now. Initially there was a recall on the D5000 for a failing power chip but my camera was not part of the recall. There are several nice features of this camera but none more important than it takes beautiful pictures. Shots taken at full 12.3 Megapixel fine outdoor have incredible detail. I've made blowup up to 12 x 18 and the clarity is stunning. The camera fits nicely in the hand. It has 11 focal points and 16 presets for specific situations (i.e. sunset, indoor party, sport mode, photograph children, etc. ) This makes it a very easy camera to use in the automatic mode but yet, it has all the manual settings for those who want to venture out into creative photography. One very special feature is the articulating 2.7 inch LCD display on the back of the camera. This display folds out allowing me to get low shots of the grand children without me bending over (I got a bad back) or allows me to lift the camera high and shoot over a crowd (like at a parade). Do not underestimate the advantage of this moving display. For me, it clinched the deal. The camera will shoot 4 frames per second for action pictures and that's pretty fast. You can also capture pictures in RAW format for those who want to work with Photoshop in super fine detail. Another feature that is pretty neat is the outline feature. Within the camera, you can select a picture you've taken and it will create an outline picture with white background. I take pictures of the grandchildren and print them in outline on white paper and they can now have very personalized coloring pages of them! For an artist who like to paint, they can use the outline pictures to have a sketched \"canvas\" that they can paint with everything being in perfect proportion. For educators of small children, imagine the possibility of the children coloring themselves on pages just like a coloring book. These \"coloring/painting\" pages are created WITHOUT destroying the original picture! This is a very nice camera that exceeded my expectations. The camera in automatic is rarely fooled and every snapshot I take makes me glad I choose the D5000. I got the two lens kit which covers from 18mm to 200mm. The camera even has some photo editing features you can do right from the camera like spot removal. All in all, I could not be happier with this camera. Nikon does a nice job with their products and this unit has rekindled a love of photography that had gone dormant in me.Follow up after 5 months of ownership.I continue to enjoy this camera very much. It is a solid performer. I recently bought rubber \"armor\" skin for the camera to protect it and that has worked out well. The camera does a very good job in Auto mode and you are tempted to just keep it there for all your pictures. However, I have branched out to the \"program\" mode which allows you to override the settings it chooses and play around with adjustments on aperture and shutter speed for \"more creative\" photography. I bought David Busch's book on the D5000 which gives you a lot of info not in the manual. The Vibration Reduction works very well on the camera and I'm getting good looking pictures on a regular basis. Our son got married and I gave the D5000 to my nephew and asked him to take pictures as he saw fit. From that I got a bunch of good family pictures that I will always cherish.So, my rating remains the same with absolutely no regret. After moving to the D5000 from a point and shoot camera the difference has been night and day as to the quality of pictures I've been getting. I would encourage anyone who is thinking of a DSLR to consider this camera. It is fun to use and has a plethora of features that makes photography fun without breaking the bank.ONE year ownership follow up:After a year of ownership I am happy to report the camera continues to please me with it's great picture taking ability. There has never been any time in the last year that I  regreted getting this camera. It has continued to perform flawlessly and I still have not used all the special features of this camera. The price has dropped (to be expected) and I think the D5000 is a great buy. One caution though. If you get this camera, be prepared to start loading up your hard drive with 12.3 megapixel pictures. With this great resolution, you never want to dial it back down, even though you can. Nice job Nikon!!!!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "F. LOPES", "ReviewID": "R151VTSKTZ0CSD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the D5000 for about a month now. Outstanding picture quality, really like using the GPS accessory with Apple's iPhoto automatically linking to maps. Just two drawbacks, though:1. When using the 55-200 lens with AF and VR, sometimes the camera seems to get lost and simply do not take the picture at all, need to change subject or turn it off and back on to be able to shoot, and 2. When recording movies, the AF does not work, so you need to focus manually - not a big deal if scene does not have big depth or subject does not move towards or away from the camera.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great D-SLR kit.", "Author": "Marios Tziarris \"mariaras\"", "ReviewID": "RV0WWVNPURO2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been researching this camera for 6 months and I was kinda disappointed when I heard about the recall.  I was not going to choose another camera because it seemed that Nikon would take care of the \"bad\" batch.  I planned to get the camera in time for a trip I was taking early September.  I delayed ordering it as much as I could and then one day I went ahead and ordered the camera with the 2 lens kit from Shutterbug.  I spoke with Shutterbug over the phone and they reassured me that the camera I would receive was not part of the recall.  Got the camera August 14 and I love it!  I am not an SLR expert (this is my first) but I think I made the right choice.  Many reputable companies issue recalls on their products.  Nikon handled the issue the right way and I think it's not a reason to give bad reviews to a product based on a recall.  This is a wonderful camera.I decided to make the move to the D-SLR after using a prosumer/superzoom (Panasonic) for 5 years.  I am still very happy with the superzoom but the poor ISO performance of the non-slrs was the deciding factor to get the D5000.This camera has excellent performance at ISO 1600 and the kit lenses are pretty good considering you even get image stabilisation for the price.  LiveView works pretty good if you can handle the ~ 2 sec focus delay.  I recommend this camera for the amateur photographers crossing over to SLR.For an expert review goto:[...]", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "no regrets", "Author": "R. Cook", "ReviewID": "R119QYINPMPF3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't come close to utilizing all the features of the camera but I love it so far.  I used to shoot a lot with my film SLR years ago and was initially excited about going digital, but found that the shutter delay on all my digital point and shoots was terrible.  I ended up taking fewer pictures!  Shutter delay is minimal in the D5000.  Still not as fast as a film SLR but the lag is not so long as to be irritating.Finally Nikon DSLR technology and quality are affordable.  I paid $965 I think, for the body and two lens package, which I think is more than reasonable.  There is no point in getting a higher resolution camera at this point in time because I don't think the technology is there unless you are spending many thousands of $$$$.Yes, shooting with the Live View on is a joke.  It takes up to five seconds to get a photo depending on the lighting/subject.  The workaround is simple.  Compose your photo with Live View if you like, turn off the live view and the touch of a button and THEN take your photo.  Yes it would be nice if this were not a problem but for less than a grand with video capability I am willing to put up with it.  Besides, i am old-school and actually prefer TTL composition anyway. YMMV.Hope this helps in your decision making process!", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "DC Machead \"DC Machead\"", "ReviewID": "R2USGHD5LKKQDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My prior DSLR was a 3 year old Canon Digital Rebel XT--it took OK pictures, but nothing to call home about. A recent visit by a family member yielded some phenomenal pictures of my son. Before my nephew left, I borrowed his Nikon to take some pictures and they came out well, too. Then I got to thinking...everyone I know that takes good pictures uses a Nikon and my decision was made.What struck me about this kit is the completeness and the quality of it. I purchased the 2-lens kit from Costco--it came with a Nikon case, a DSLR book and two DVDs on DSLR photography. I think it's a wise decision on Nikon's part to market its equipment with DVDs on how to use it because people will be left with the impression that Nikon equipment is better based on the results they get from it...a little education goes a long way.The camera has a solid feel despite having a plastic case. The adjustable LCD screen usually stays flat on the back of my camera, but I have used it when photographing in crowds. It's also nice for environmental pictures because you can see what's going on in the viewfinder without having to draw attention to yourself setting up a shot. The menu system is very good and allows you to get to the controls very quickly compared to the menu system on my older Canon Digital Rebel XT. What is really nice is the picture viewing system on the camera--you can quickly make your way through your pictures and delete the ones you don't want without having to press all sorts of buttons.Neophytes will also appreciate the help system on the camera. With every camera I've previously owned, I had to carry the manual around in the bag in order to remember how to alter all the settings and what the sometimes cryptic icons mean. On the Nikon, you can just press the help button on any setting and it'll give you a quick explanation of what a particular setting does. It also gives you example pictures for the various ISO settings, which makes life a lot easier when trying to set your camera up for a shot.The autofocus is fast for a prosumer camera, the lenses are sharp, and the focus settings are very easy to manipulate. If you're looking for a nice DSLR to get your feet wet with, this is a wonderful camera. The only downside is the autofocus motor is built into the Nikon lenses...you're married to AF-S lenses, so if you expect to take your photography to higher levels after this one, you risk the investment in your lenses. For me, this camera is perfect and has opened up a new world for me in terms of where I can take good pictures.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, which I had known of the 2 lens kit before I bought everything separately", "Author": "Surgery100 \"ADJ\"", "ReviewID": "R13MWFIHU08ODU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Strong feature set for the money. Excellent picture quality. Good lens kit (vibration reduction works great). Great camera for beginners and non-hardcore enthusiasts (Hard core enthusiasts might want to consider the D300s). Many automatic presets allow beginners to feel comfortable, easy controls allow creativity for more experienced users. Articulated LCD.Cons: No autofocus in video mode. No autofocus motor in camera body (on the flip side this keeps weight and cost down).Summary: Most common controls are intuitive and a small learning curve unveils the rest. The flip screen is a big plus, particularly in conjunction with the live-view mode which allows to frame and construct the picture without using the viewfinder. Very fast processor (same as in D90) and a 20 picture plus buffer allows for bursts at maximum resolution (maximum resolution and JPEG fine quality with a class 6 memory card allows 8-10 picture burst without decreasing quality, less if taking pictures in RAW format).The camera does not have an autofocus motor (like most in this class). While this makes the camera lighter and reduces the price, it also limits the autofocus lenses available (will only autofocus with AF-S or the more expensive AF-I lenses). Any Nikon mount lens is compatible, but if they are not AF-S or -I you'll need to focus manually. That being said, the two lenses included with this kit are fantastic. I initially bought the kit with the 18-55mm lens and ended up buying the 55-200mm within a week. The lenses focus quickly, even in dim light conditions. They are both very quiet which is a big plus in certain situations (taking pictures of animals for instance). Sigma and Tamron also offer a host of compatible lenses.The camera allows to shoot short (5 min) hi-def video (720). This is a nice extra, but keep in mind a couple of things, it will not autofocus after video capture starts, and the mic is quite poor. Again, a nice addition, but not really a strong feature.Among the three $1100 and less Nikon models, compared to the D3000, the D5000 has a much more robust feature set, faster processor and better resolution. It also shoots video and all this for about $125-150 more. Most certainly worth the step up. Compared to the D90, it has similar photo quality and features. The controls on the D90 allow for slightly easier selection, also the camera has an autofocus motor, allowing for a wider lens selection. Finally, when shooting video, it can autofocus even after capture has started. At about $350-400 more consider whether these features are worth the extra expense, but it seems like a big jump in price for a small jump in features (and almost imperceptible difference in quality).", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love my camera!", "Author": "D. Mellinger \"DMM\"", "ReviewID": "R5V88MT30NDVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have loved taking pictures for years. I am by no means a professional photographer but still love good results. My husband bought me the D5000 and starter kit for Christmas and I've never looked back!  I am still learning functions and features but it is the most fun thing! Automatic saves me when I am stumped, but I've set up the tripod and taken midnight pictures of fireworks over Pike's Peak that came out just amazing. Full moon setting over the mountains that is pretty darn good, if I say so myself. Close ups are amazingly detailed. I love the zoom lens for all sorts of wildlife pics.  The VR feature is wonderful for eliminating any blur if I should not be quite as steady as I should be without the tripod. The \"Scene\" feature really helps the blues \"pop\" for sunrise and sunset pictures. Night Landscape is wonderful as is the Portrait setting for close ups of animals.I really appreciated the Nikon \"how to\" DVD's that were enclosed with the particular kit he bought me. I am a visual person and seeing something shown is easier for me to grasp than reading and trying to apply. There is a lot to learn but if it is overwhelming at first, one step at a time and as I say, Automatic always works!The fact that the LCD tilts and flips is 'neat' but not the biggest draw of the camera. Maybe as I get more practice and experience this summer, I may find it helpful. I DO like the size of the display, however. It is great.I haven't used the video feature much so don't have a lot to say about that as yet.  I'd recommend purchasing a polarizing filter for the camera for bright sunlight pictures, even though the zoom has a hood with it.  Just a personal preference. I also have a clear lens filter to protect the lens itself.I keep the camera and bag at the dining room table to capture the deer and other wildlife that stroll by the house and if we are headed out for a drive, I put it in the car and take it with me everywhere we go.

Before this Nikon I used a Canon Xti which is very good as well but didn't have the video capturing option that I really like.Something the description of the Nikon D5000 doesn't mention is that the highest video definition is 720p but I can tell that even though it is not full Hd (1080p) the quality is amazing.  I used to record video with point and shoot cameras and this Nikon D5000 is really outstanding!When I bought it I thought the Vari angle LCD was something I would barely use but today I can say it is very useful specially when taking pictures close to the ground as those of my new dog sleeping over my slippers.  What I don't like about it is that it takes a lot of time focusing so sometimes I just turn off the Autofocus and do it manually and also it takes more time to take pictures.Both lenses work very nice and they feel very solid; I like them very much.  The VR function (vibration reduction) is very useful when taking videos and when using the zoom specially with low light conditions.I strongly recommend buying a high speed SD card in order to be able to capture longer videos and capture lots of pictures leaving the shooter pressed down.Finally I would say I really like the picture and video quality, ease of use, battery charging time, lenses compatibility.I would like a battery pack for this camera.Lovable!", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "A GREAT camera!", "Author": "J. gallegos", "ReviewID": "R1FNDX9GZ0G8UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nikon D5000 is my entry into the world of DSLRs and after using the camera for 2 months now, I wish I had bought it sooner.  Picture quality is excellent, the camera is fairly easy to use and handle, even the kit lens (the 18-55mm)takes great photos (I heard most kit lenses aren't great).I only have two negatives about this camera (so far):- the camera won't operate an external flash wirelessly.  I'm not sure what the correct terminology is, but if you have a Nikon Speedlight (external flash) and want to position it away from the camera, there is no way for the camera to trigger the flash wirelessly.  You need the Nikon SU 800 (or a cheaper trigger unit).- this particular kit comes with both the 18-55 and 55-200mm lenses.  I guess for many the 55-200 lens might seem standard.  If you are used to zooming in when you take your pictures or travel a lot, the 55-200mm lens will definitely come in handy.  But personally, I think the 18-55mm lens is all you need.  Besides a couple of test shots, I have not used or needed to use my 55-200 lens at all.  Personally, I wish I had gone with the D5000 Kit I (the 18-55mm only) and used that extra money I spent on a lens (like the Nikon 35mm f/1.8).Overall, a great camera!", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defective!

I have talked with people who own dSLRs (both Cannon and Nikon). I narrowed my search down to the Nikon D90 or D5000(based on price, quality and ease of use). Both got great reviews for their color quality and ease of use. These two cameras are almost identical. The only differences I found were the type of lenses they use and the fps. The D5000 takes AF-s lenses because the auto-focus motor is located in the lens and the D90's motor is in the camera. The d5000 takes 4 fps and the D90 takes 4.5 fps on continuous shooting. For the difference in price I didn't think that buying AF-S lenses was a big deal and .5 fps wasn't enough of a difference to justify the price. This camera has an on board tutor to help you decide how to use the settings. Lenses are easy to find. It isn't too heavy. The colors in my pictures are great! I took the camerea to my son's football game I had the color setting on vivid (makes primary colors pop) and continuous shooting on the sports setting and got pics of him tackling, getting handoffs from the quarterback, and catching passes. Lucky for me I got to stand on the sidelines to get some shots. I used the 55-200mm lens and I got shots that were on the other side of the field. Even if you can't get that close, the camerea is 12.3 mega pixels, so you can crop in on the photo with your photo software and the picture will still look great.

I spent several months comparing a wide variety of options mainly from Nikon, Cannon and Sony.  Ultimately made the purchase when the D5000 was discontinued and prices dropped.  As long as you can still find them I don't think you can get a better entry level DLSR right now for the price.  You're getting upper level image quality at an entry level price.  The only thing that might have swayed me to another option would be the slightly better implementation of HD video on the new models from Cannon or some of the higher priced Nikons.  The video quality of the D5000 is very good to grab a short clip but I have an HD camcorder that I'll still use for any significant video project.  My priority was to get the best quality still image and I think that the money I saved will be much better spent on quality lenses and accessories.While I couldn't be happier with the image quality I have discovered one relatively minor issue that is addressed in some reviews, but that I didn't fully appreciate until I saw it for myself.  I didn't anticipate just how slow the autofocus is in live view mode (anytime you use the rear LCD to frame your shot).  There are 2 totally separate autofocus systems in this camera.  The contrast detection mode used when the LCD is active has some great features, but is very slow.  I had gotten in the habit with my point and shoot camera of using the LCD to frame most shots and initially tried to carry that over to the D5000.  It can literally take 2-3 seconds to focus this way (or longer under low light/contrast conditions) which doesn't work well at all for a moving subject.  I can usually focus the lens much faster manually.  I have since reacquired the skill of using my viewfinder (or manual focus) as I did with my old film SLRs.  I have been very happy with the speed and accuracy of the phase detection autofocus using the viewfinder when the live view mode is turned off.  This does decrease the value of the nice hinged LCD somewhat if you planned to use it in autofocus mode for any type of fast action shot.  Not a dealbreaker for me and as I said earlier I'm very happy with the camera considering the other great features and value, but something to take into consideration as you compare.

Was recommended on Ken Rockwell's site so I went with it - supposedly Nikons make great beginner SLR's (versus Canons).  Can't get too technical yet, but the pics are great.  Went to the pumpkin patch with my twins last weekend and got stunning pics - the sun hitting off all of the pumpkins, very vivid oranges.  Would recommend to a friend so far.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Joanna L.

I don't even think I've had to look in the owners manual.  It's simple to use and it's fairly self explanatory.  I don't even mind that the video isn't auto focus.  I like being able to control the blur, etc.  I did purchase a separate prime lens (55mm 1.8) which I highly recommend as well, but the two lenses which came with this camera are amazing.

The images are spectacular.  The camera fits my hands better than the Canon T1i.  I also prefer to access the controls via the buttons on the left of the lcd (Canon T1i has most if not all buttons on the right side of the lcd only).  The only downfalls for this camera are the dim viewfinder and the not very bright lcd (I can easily live with these flaws in favor of the great images).  If image quality is your primary goal (Why wouldn't it be?) and you can live with the previously mentioned minor flaws, this camera is definitely for you.  Versus the T1i, in my opinion you can can save $100-$200 by buying the D5000 and on top of it you'd get a better camera.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon 5000 excellent camera", "Author": "Eppie \"Eppie\"", "ReviewID": "R2HCQAKTMHQ932", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent camera for beginer or exp. photographer.
