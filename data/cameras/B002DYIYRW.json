It looked like it WOULD hold up to outdoor use.But things went downhill fast.The software simply would NOT work.I have 3 different computers, running 3 different versions of windows, and I could NOT get the DVR to work on any pc. (windows XP home, XP media center 2005, Vista Ultimate)The little tiny instruction sheets (about the size of 5 index cards, folded in half, to make a booklet) did NOT give insight into what windows systems were or were not compatible.  I could not find any minimum PC requirements anywhere.(I planned to use this as a DVR, to record video events on my PC)On my Vista pc, the software WOULD NOT even load.  The install would crash and abort.On XP home, the software installed BUT.... when you launched it, you would often get an exception error.I visted the WISECOMM website, but could not get any drivers nor downloads that might help me.I was never even able to get a picture to come up on my pc (from the camera to the base unit DVR).After spending a couple hours with it, I packed them up and took them back to walmart for a refund.I really had high hopes for this unit, but if it won't work, then why bother with it.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just Terrible", "Author": "Arran Lappin", "ReviewID": "R2EJM87Z1NVQKS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a cheap camera, that's what you pay for and that's what you'll get. The static interference is atrocious at 15ft away I can't imagine 400. It boasts about on board mics but I cant find them, there are zero audio settings in the software or users manual. The camera itself has a pretty decent image though it's never stable. The night vision's impressive but again this means nothing with out a good connection. Forget about customer service they have yet to finish that portion of their website. So buyer beware.

So far it works better than I expected for the money I paid.  The software installed without a hitch, the camera and the receiver does exactly what I had expected. The software includes unexpected bennies like camera and motion detection settings plus a recording scheduler, and frame selector for the PC. The camera construction is heavy duty too, made of metal not plastic. Next I buy another wireless camera, since the DVR is set up for four cameras.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Clover CW5700 2.4 GHz Wireless Video", "Author": "CoffeeQC", "ReviewID": "R39PZSOD30KAYL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Couldn't install DVR software on mini disc because my antivirus program detected a trojan,IFinst27.exe.

Ayd III", "ReviewID": "R2LTAD73BHD5AJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unpacked the unit today. Read the instructions.  Installed the camera and base station about 20 feet apart. No video or audio out of the base station to a known working monitor.  Moved the camera next to the base station but only received video and audio noise.  Tried to contact Wisecomm but the url on the pitiful instruction manual does not work.  Since I purchased the unit more than a year ago I guess I am SOL.  Save your money.
