Size is very small- wife loves it, goes in purse easily2. Decent pics3. Numerous features- including video+zoom...I like the \"Backlight\" scene since lot of photos the subjects face goes dark if their background is very bright and this corrects for that (with a flash)Negative:1. Being used to a Canon, there is a big delay in this one..you press the trigger and hte lcd goes blank for longish time....(I think it has taken the pic so u can move your hand..its just writing to the card...which does not hurt the pic I think...) but annoying anyway..", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "It broke in 6 months", "Author": "Y. Wang", "ReviewID": "R14YOMFFFSWGQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the Samsung L100 camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday in April, 2009. This unit broke in 6 months under normal use. I sent my daughter's camera to the them after talking to a customer service rep. The unit was sent back in 3 business days. Wow! That was quick. Guess what? A simple letter inside the package saying that \"the unit was damaged beyond repair\". No further explaination about what was the damage and why it was not under waranty. I am not even sure if they even open the camera to check on what is wrong. I will never buy their product again with this kind of services. I hope you don't never need to reach my position with them.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good option if your expectations are not high", "Author": "G. Abella", "ReviewID": "R1XCS5ZYV61XD5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a camera and size and price are your concerns, this is a good choice. At around $100, 8mp and a very slim desing, it is a good buy. However, if image quality is important to you, then you would be better served with a Canon or a Sony. Of course, that would mean that you would have to spend around $50-80 more.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Small, light and takes good pictures", "Author": "Edgardo Pichardo \"Boomz\"", "ReviewID": "R1TPT2JFNALNC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very small and light. Many modes included but automatic setting can handle most conditions. Manual included as a wizard on the screen! It's like a tutorial mode! Great idea! Takes good pictures and videos. Short wait time from shot to shot (2-3 seconds). As with any other digital camera, very low light shots are not good most of the time but the camera always get the job done right on close shots with flash. Great value for the price. I'm truly happy. I recommend this product for a point and shoot camera. Far cheaper than other brands with same results.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazin", "Author": "Alma D.
