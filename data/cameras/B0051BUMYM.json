{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Be Warned - Line of sight required from sensor to receiver!", "Author": "SilverGhost", "ReviewID": "R2488LUW6OYJW2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I needed a driveway sensor as our main living quarters are on  opposite side of house from driveway. The driveway is about 150' long and lined by thick trees. The house is also surrounded by trees in the direction of the driveway.This sensor requires the sensor, mounted outside, to be in a direct line of sight to the receiver. If you have obstructions that prohibit that, then this won't work. I promptly returned it to Amazon.A few cons on this device:1. The receiver is not very loud, with volume at highest. If you have it in another room and have any noise going, such as a radio or tv, you likely won't hear it.2. It says water resistant. Once you read the instructions, it says it is NOT waterproof, so mount it under an eave or something. Hard to do if you want to mount it on a tree.3. As stated already, it is an IR device, requiring line of sight. The description does not say that, only when I read the instructions did I find that out.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poorly written set-up pairing instructions!  However...", "Author": "Manzaraliman", "ReviewID": "R31HL3X6IO6GHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Followed pairing instructions as written.  Unit did not respond as stated in instructions.  Customer service phone support doesn't exist.  Placed on hold over 30 minutes, then disconnected with a message saying, \"Thanks for calling, goodbye\"!  Decided to freelance and ignore the instructions applying common sense.  Whalla!  It paired.  If you aren't tech savvy or patient, buy another unit.  Will follow-up on serviceability of the unit after a year of service.Update:  Once I solved the pairing problem, the unit has functioned as promised.  Had one false alarm and discovered it was caused by sunshine brightness fluctuating behind clouds.  Repositioned the transmitter and the problem went away.  Maybe I was a little too tough in my initial review, so I'll modify my rating to 4 stars.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic little device", "Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "RLRBQHGFHJ72J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have a long driveway and this little unit serves as an early warning doorbell placed about 30 feet from my home.

The base station runs out of batteries very quickly and thus is basically only usable in locations where you can plug it into an outlet. This is the only downside but it limits its use.

The manufacturers customer service department is so poor, that I would not purchase another item from them. This item worked until one morning at 3 am when it started signaling and would not stop.  It turned out to be a bad PIR sensor which I replaced.  Dealing with this manufacturer's customer service department shows that this company does not value their customer relation, nor does it appear that they want to maintain a returning customer relationship. They quoted me a two to four week turnaround time to repair, or replace the unit.  I replaced this unit with the Chamberlain CWA2000Chamberlain CWA2000 Wireless Motion Alert System (Black) which works great, and allows you to add up to eight sensors, while the SVAT unit only allows you to pair three transmitters.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dom", "Author": "DOMINIC BRACCO", "ReviewID": "RO37EG2WH0XDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be the best driveway monitor ever for this price.Works much better than the AS SEEN ON TV brand.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Range Problem", "Author": "silverfox", "ReviewID": "R1RN5213HIX673", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Advertised range is up to 300 ft.
