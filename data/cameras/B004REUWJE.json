The quality is very good, and very easy to operate and switch programs to match the conditions. Yet, sometimes it's too slow when I want to capture a good moment, it takes a couple seconds from the moment you press the button until it's actually taking the photo, and hop! the great moment is gone... so consider that when you are buying this camera. Furthermore, the chargeable battery that comes with it also runs off pretty fast so you might want to consider that too.Overall I give it 3 stars, because I like the design, the convenience of usage and the quality.and I took 2 stars away for the battery and the good moments I wasn't able to capture in time.Hope this was helpful to all of you who are looking for a good camera at a reasonable price.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Honglimin", "ReviewID": "R2KNFLR39CVY38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is very intuitively designed for the person like me who just want to turn on it and shot a good photos without the presetting.

The pouch provides good protection.  This is probably our third Canon camera.  At the time I picked this up at a very good price under $200 and when they break I buy another.  My wife doesnt bother with all the manual settings- mainly used on auto setting.  16 Megapixels is overkill the 5x optical is nice.  Image stabilizer is very desirable.

Dont get me wrong, but this little gem takes breathtaking pictures in daylight with just the right amount of punch in the colors to make it seem vivid!
