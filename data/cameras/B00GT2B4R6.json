I think the GoPro handles high contrast and low lighting better (low setting sun, for example) than the Mobius but you get a lot in a very small package and I'm certainly not disappointed with it for what I paid.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Dashcam!!", "Author": "Photoknut \"Photoknut\"", "ReviewID": "REM9EU3WVTUJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have one of these in each of my cars and am thrilled with them.  They are so much more compact than my previous dashcams, and the clarity is amazing.  I have edited a number of my videos to post up online.  Images are so clear you can easily read license plates.  There is a fantastic user community that supports these cameras in all their uses.  The developers are tuned into these groups and listen to the feedback.  Very cool to have such great input into the success of a device.  Highly recommend this camera.  very easy to setup and use.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "High quality, low price, great features!", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R1J0SZ6BLBW9BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best dash can you can buy for the money! Great day and night quality, no useless features like screens or LEDs, and firmware updates quite often. This camera is smaller than a box of tic tacs yet records better than some cameras twice its size. It mounts very stealthily behind a rearview mirror, or anywhere for that matter. The GUI interface is very simple to use and allows for both a basic and advanced user to adjust essential settings. This camera is also very popular for rc plane and helicopter enthusiasts due to its microscopic size. All things considered for a chinise no name camera, this thing is very high quality.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Enealio", "ReviewID": "R3TG96IXRS78BO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best pieces of tech I\u2019ve purchased for my bike. As a bike commuter in Los Angeles, I\u2019m happy at all of the tech becoming available to make biking safer. I was recently in an altercation with a motorist and I had no video documentation of the incident. So after looking around at cameras, it came down this this and a GoPro.Pros:\u2022 Super lightweight. I wear it as a helmet cam. You won\u2019t even know the thing is there. Plus it\u2019s size makes it easy to just throw in your pocket when you get done with a ride.\u2022 It\u2019s horizontal instead of vertical. What I mean by that is look at someone with a GoPro on their helmet. That that sticks up like a billboard. Not sleek and I wonder about the wind resistance. Especially if I were to place one on my scooter helmet. With the Mobius, it lays flat and well out of the way.\u2022 Crazy customization options. Download the software, the company must be filled with makers and tinkerers. The amount of customization options is mindblowing. And they often release firmware updates with new exciting options.\u2022 Decent battery life. I\u2019m running it with a 32gb class 10 Sony card and I\u2019m getting about an hour and fifteen minutes on a charge. That\u2019s not bad. I\u2019m not sure what GoPro gets but a friend with a first gen GP is barely making it to 45 min on a charge.\u2022 Excellent video quality. There are plenty of youtube videos out there showing the quality. They tell the truth. I purchased my Mobius with a wide angle lens to capture more of my surroundings. Excellent quality. I can pause it and easily read a license plate.\u2022 The price. Less than a hundred bucks? Totally a steal.Cons:\u2022 No image stabilization. So it could get a bit shaky. As mentioned, I mount mine to my helmet so the shakiness isn\u2019t that bad. If this were handlebar mounted I expect it would be a rough video to watch.\u2022 No waterproof case yet. They do sell a case to help protect it from the environment but since I\u2019ve read reports about the heat sinks getting pretty hot, I would worry about putting that on.\u2022 I don\u2019t care for the material that coats the camera. I understand that it\u2019s a bit rubbery to help if you drop it but I wanted this camera to be as low profile on my head as possible and wanted to use some super strong Velcro. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t get anything to stick to the camera. So I\u2019ll be getting some mounts instead. Not a big deal. Just a personal preference for me.\u2022 It\u2019s so small, fellow bikers are always asking about it. Ok, that\u2019s not really a con. Unless I\u2019m in a rush.I 100% recommend this camera. For bicycling, for scootering, for motorcycles, as a dash cam, for sports, you name it. You won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.95", "Features": "1080P HD Video Mini Action Camera\nUses a Japanese Wide-Angle Lens with HFOV of 116 Degrees\nSmall Size, Incredibly Light - 2 x 1 x 1 and only 1.37 oz!\nCan be Mounted to Bike, Car or just about Anything!\n80 Minutes Battery Life", "Name": "Mobius Action Camera 1080P HD Mini Sports Cam - Wide Angle Edition", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QdkYZGDGL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GT2B4R6"}}
