The results were marginal, not much better than unguided. As far  as being a respectable imaging camera well... let's just say it tries.  the camera only records 600x900  pixels so don't expect a miracle.  Despite it's shortcomings, it's not ALL bad, I took some frames of Jupiter  the small display screen for the image was difficult to see under field conditions however, I was able to obtain a fairly good image.  The camera is easy to focus when connected to the visual back and the icap software is also pretty user friendly.  The camera, as with all of my other Celestron products worked seamlessly with third-party software such as PHD and ASCOM drivers.  Overall, wouldn't buy it again for the money.  really not a great product.  *Please, if anyone from Celestron or Sony reads my review feel free to contact me and I will give  you the \"down  and dirty\" of how your product performed- or didn't.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DQSRMEA"}}
