{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Digital Camera", "Author": "BARBARA WOLFE", "ReviewID": "RNU425DOO44JZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has surprisingly taken over as a ratings leader in digital cameras.  This camera is a little bigger and heavier than the pocket cameras I have had in the past, but it has a 30x zoom that makes up for it.  A friend of mine bought this camera a year ago for over $800.  My camera was $400 less than that.  It takes beautiful pictures, as expected.  I have only begun to use all the features.  Settings can be manually adjusted.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, fantastic video, fantastic Zoom!", "Author": "Heat", "ReviewID": "R2TWM5IZ12KDM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera! Just took it to Paris, pictures came out fantastic. However, I think the videos are even more spectacular! Plus, the zoom is incredible!

It seems to be a good camera but it does require some getting accustomed to. Many features are not intuitive and the instruction book is really lousy.

Keith \"sea pen\"", "ReviewID": "R1MOXZCLOYKND7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the camera. I bought it on the recommendation of my son who had one. It has incredible stabilization and very clear pictures even at 30x zoom. The video is as as good or better than my 1080P video camera. I had just purchased a video camera but have hardly used it after having this camera. It is very handy to only carry one camera for everything you need. The only thing I am disappointed in is the flash. You cannot rotate it up for bounce so close subjects are washed out.  I have overcome this problem by putting the camera on the \"P\" setting and using the knob on the top to cut the exposure back to -2. I can then  use it to take portraits at close distances.  The items that came with the camera (which made it a bargain at the time), were sorry, except for the battery and SD card. The case was not as pictured and the belt loop was torn. The card reader did not work at all. That is why I knocked off a star.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "love this sony", "Author": "charles rosendahl", "ReviewID": "R2NNYVLZSHAVDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the pic's are beautiful, it makes me look like a professional.

The extras are good but  not all needed (especially the cleaning bits but also the cables/charger...  It is not bad, but I might go for getting only separate items.
