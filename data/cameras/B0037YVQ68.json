Things started out well, packaged arrived two four days early. (Must have to do with Amazon Prime.) The unit is big about 5.5 by 2.5 by 1.25 inches and weighs about 8 to 9 ounces. It comes with a pouch and a strap that lets it hang over one sholder or you can use its very big belt loop. Yes it is very clunky. You also get a USB cord with it. Now the problems. The sofware is for Windows XP and Vista. There is no mention of Windows 7 anywhere (hint). The USB cord and drivers are for USB 1.1 (hint, hint). Although you can buy the unit alone, it is heavily marketed with the HiTi 510 dye sub printer for wireless printing. Great for event photographers. (I have a Kodak 6850 dye sub printer, so no printer needed.) The WFT 510 PC software says its for use with computers and wifi connections. It also says that it will do an Ad hoc connection with cameras and printers.Now to the problems. The software booklet is in Chingilsh and very sparsly written. Computer networking is alreadly voodoo science and involves a lot of hoping and praying. But trying to work with it with using a booklet that was written by a Chinese engineer who thinks you should already know what your doing, just too hard. Even if you figure out what the right numbers and codes to put into your \"default gateway\" and \"subnet mask,\" you still will not be able to figure out where you went wrong on the IP address and which port is the right one. etx. Needless to say I still haven't gotten the WFT 510 to work right. And Yes, I have Windows 7 on my computers, so there.  (I'm not going back to XP or Vista! I can't take that aggravation!) I've sent an email to HiTi asking for help. They have 48 hours to answer or this thing is going back.At this time I cannot really recommend this to anyone, except wait for the next version.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "WFT510 needs a firmware upgrade!!!!!", "Author": "Gugulethu I.

We purchased 2 of these along with the printers to be used at events.  It could not keep up with the photos that we needed to print, also the batteries from the camera were back charging the unit making it hot and it would shut down.  I even sent it back to the manufacturer for the back charging problem and they told me it wasn't doing it??????  Would not recommend!!  Find something else!!", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0037YVQ68"}}
