{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bad Service from Sony -Lots of Baloney", "Author": "Joseph Welsh", "ReviewID": "R3492J6KAQ38GP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in April of 2011 shortly after it was released by Sony. I did not really get to use it until more than a month later on a trip where it was mainly used as an underwater camera. I closely followed all of the manufacturers instructions on keeping it clean and watertight. The cameral was never in more than 3 feet deep. The camera failed miserably. Many of the pics came out with millions of white spots and no focus. There was water leakage in the lense. The panoramic shots came out with lines and uneven connections between the photos, the camera changed to the lowest resolution each time the video function was used without my doing anything. The resolution changed so often, that I did not notice. Often, landscape shots came out with undersaturated colors. We coincidentally spent a fair amount of time with another couple we met who had just purchased the same camera. They had none of the problems we had. The BIGGEST problem was that when I tried to replace it, it was beyond Amazon's 30 day return policy and they would not replace it. So I emailed and called Sony repeatedly and was directed to their Laredo, Texas \"customer satisfaction\" center. What a joke! I have never spoken to more uneducated and unfamiliar with the product techs in my life. I ended up mailing the camera back to them at my own expense and after a few weeks, was advised that there was nothing wrong with my camera and it was sent back unrepaired, with no instructions or invoice showing what had or had not been done. I continued to call and email them, and another tech asked me to send him photo samples which I did. He agreed that there was a problem after looking at the photos and said that their \"high-level\" techs were going to look at it and get back to me. Then I never heard from them again. I called and emailed them several times, tried to speak to a supervisor who never called back, and no resolution to my camera issues. Moreover, they scratched the glass touchscreen, and the lense still leaks. Other parts of the camera did not leak, only the lense, for which there was nothing I could do to prevent other than not use the camera in water. This has been a most frustrating experience. Never mind the lost pics in a part of the world I may never get to see again.

I have one for the supposed shock proof warranty. I am a caver and this camera has been great for 5 months. I take it in my cave sack take photos go home clean it and it has always worked well (other than the dust spots from the flash). Anyway, last time i went i tossed my cave pack about 4 feet down below me. Later when i got the camera out the liquid crystals behind the glass had ruptured. Something in the bag must have hit the screen on the back of the phone. I thought \"well good thing it has a shock proof warranty\". So i sent it to Sony and they said the damage wasn't covered. I asked what made the damage not covered. All they would say is we examined it and it is of the type of damage not covered. I asked whats the difference between this shock damage and the kind that is covered. They said \"the camera was damaged in a way that is not covered\". We went in circles, me trying to find out why and them telling me it was examined and judged that it will not be covered, but they never told me why my damage was not covered, but some other shock damage is covered. I asked to speak to managers and all just answered with the same script. I asked how much to repair and was told it would be more than the camera is worth so i would have to buy a new one. That is the last Sony product i will ever buy (and i buy a lot). Worst part is the camera doesn't even have a view finder. So even though the guts of the camera work, i can't see anything to take a photo.

Vo", "ReviewID": "R1DYFR98LMX4R3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really liked my first waterproof compact camera --- the Pentax Optio W10.Took decent pictures and waterproof ... great for snapping pictures of my kids in and around the water.Also bought the Optio W30 and W60, hoping that the updated models would be much better than the previous. Unfortunately, the picture quality seems to get worse with each newer model. Bummer.Got the Canon D10 ... I like the pictures from the D10 better than the Pentax, used D10 as primary and the W60 as backup.D10 is bulky and focusing is rather slow, but the jpeg colors are nicer than the Pentax.Got the Sony DCS-TX10 last week, have not tried under water yet but have the following observations:Positives:- Much quicker focusing than D10- Wide angle starts at 25mm vs 35mm for D10- Awesome HD movie mode with zoom support and stereo sound- Good punchy pictures with accurate colors- Very compact- Image stabilization very good- Sweep panorama is useful and fun- Sliding cover protects lensNegatives:- It takes a few seconds from power on until first shot- Takes 5-7 seconds to start recording a movie if not in movie mode-- This is very annoying, maybe it can be fixed via future firmware update?- Not too crazy about the touch screen interface- Battery doesn't seem to last very long (about same as D10)- Water proof to 5m versus 10m for D10- Playing back pictures seems a little sluggishThere is no separate battery charger, it is charged inside the camera via a USB cable, like an iPod/iPhone.I prefer to have a separate charger so that I can charge a spare battery while still using the camera, but I guess others might prefer just charging from a USB port. Just to be clear, it does come with a charger plug (like an iPhone) so you can charge from a wall socket as well. But no standalone charger.Bought this battery and charger kit from Amazon:Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony Cyber-shot NP-BN1, DSC-T99, DSC-TX5, DSC...I've not taken it in the water yet ... so unless this camera dies on me after hitting the water or does something really unexpected, I would say this is the best waterproof compact that I have owned and would highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Dylan", "ReviewID": "R3BHRX2NCWT94X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from the TX5 to the TX10 (lost my TX5). The first thing I noticed was the more plastic-like feel to the TX10. The 5 felt more like a small canon, real solid and heavy. Don't worry though, the plastic feels very high quality and nothing about the camera feels cheap in hand. The touch screen takes some getting used to. If you're an SLR user or a canon point and shoot user then you'll probably be frustrated with the Sony menu's at first. The OS is getting better and better with each iteration. This camera is definitely more user friendly than my NX-5 even without the dials. Personally I like dials and larger buttons but you'll need to make the trade off for pocketability. If you're undecided at the TS3 and theTX10 it might help to know that the TX10 feels about half the size in your hand. It's really tiny for a waterproof camera. My sister has the Canon D10 and again, it feels huge compared to the TX10. Overall, the camera has an insane amount of features for the price point. The pictures look amazing but they do have a \"painted\" look at times. Sony uses quite a bit of processing for noise and shake reduction which gives occasional photos a fake look. Though at this price point I think the camera takes phenomenal pics.One major issue is the color shown on Amazon and Sony's website. It's not even CLOSE to the blue you'll get. I bought the blue because I have a Benchmade knife that looked to be the same exact color. It's not... This camera is about 10 shades darker and has a very anodized/glossy look to it. Honestly, it's very girly looking. I sent it back and went with the green which has a much more matte and manly look to it. It's similar to old greenish/yellow sony products from the past (mini-disc players especially). Don't be fooled by YouTube unboxing videos either. For some reason cameras cant seem to capture that blue color accurately. I should have listed to the other reviewer on here.Pros:* Tiny!* Great photos for the price point* Amazing features, underwater panoramas? Crazy.* Solid Feel* Great battery* Touch screen is great with gloves, there's a stylus that hooks to the wrist strap. It's easer than fat fingering buttons, even big ones.* Amazing low-light picturesCons:* Only 16MP in 4:3, switching to 16:9 photos gives you 12MP. If you're a pixel counter you might get annoyed. I'm not.* Only waterproof to 16ft* Very slow movie recording. 5 seconds from button click to actual recording.* A bit slow moving through menus and deleting photosFinal Thoughts:If size isn't a factor, I'd probably go with the TS3 because of the extra depth and dials. If you're a backpacker or someone that doesn't wear giant cargo pants, definitely go with the TX10. You can take it everywhere! Lastly, unless you want to tell people it's your girlfriends camera, go with the green or black.Update:I still love this camera. I recently took it to Havasupai for a pretty rough trip through rocks and water. The screen is showing some scratches after hitting a few rocks (not gorilla glass apparently). I was also a little frustrated trying to use the touch screen with wet hands. Otherwise the camera was a great asset on the trip. I jumped off an 8' waterfall while filming a movie and the camera continued to film after splashing in the pool below... good times.Be careful where you put it in your bag though, I had it mixed with some towels and water and the lens cover slid open and drained about half the battery before I caught it.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT WATERPROOF!!!", "Author": "Rick Sheinin", "ReviewID": "R3O7HXL2CUUPV1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Exact same thing happened to me as did to KW.

They just kept repeating their words and refused to honor their warranty\"There has to be an issue with the seal.

Spend some time reading the manual, there is a learning curve involved to get the most from this camera.

I purchased this camera back in May 2011 primarily because I wanted to take some underwater pictures and videos for my awesome vacation in Hawaii. Being a skeptical person, I read reviews, research, look at specs of all the waterproof cameras and decided on the Sony Cybershot TX-10. I have taken it to snorkeling in Maui, snorkeling Phi Phi island in Thailand, silly underwater group pics in swimming pools, fish ponds, trekking in the jungle (with rain), taking pics of crabs on the beach and have sand all over it, cold weathers in new york. I give it 5 star for the ruggedness and waterproof quality. I mean, I take this little gadget EVERYWHERE i travel. I took my boyfriend's DSLR with me to Thailand because I thought I was going to use it, but I ended up using this Sony instead because it's so small, light, and attractive. I also give it 5 stars for the looks, yes. This camera is sexy, slick, and discreet, and people give compliments all the time. They don't believe it can go underwater and in the rain!! It's so small and think I can fit it in my back pocket or small wrist purse when I go night outings with my friends. I will give it 5 stars for the quality of the images and videos, high res. images everytime, this camera can take pics in darker surroundings. It also offers many modes to choose from. My favorite is the macro mode. This camera can take things super close up! I like taking bug pictures. haha. Video quality? that's the awesome part, you can do everything with this cam. I took so many videos, (underwater ones too), and they are in great, satisfying quality and sound. I mean, if you mess around and learn all the modes, you'd realize so many things you can do with the camera. Another mode I use alot is panoramic sweep. I love this mode!!!!! When I travel to a great place and I can't seem to get everything in a single frame, Panoramic sweep is so handy for it. Yes, you can take 5 different pics and use photoshop but that's just too many steps. Some down sides to this camera would be, there is a delay (like 3 seconds) when you press record for video. It gets annoying because if you have the need to immediately record something...you'd totally miss it. I learn to just get used to it so it doesn't bother me too much. Same thing when taking pictures, if you want to immediately snap a photo...you can't. There is that 1-2 second delay. It's a bit frustrating sometimes. There are some scenes/modes that I don't use very often but they come in handy when the time calls for it. Over all, I am satisfied and I can say that I love this camera and it was worth the money I invested in it.

I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed!", "Author": "Patience", "ReviewID": "R9CBXX1B2L7FU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this digital camera to replace our Canon and that was my first mistake.  It's pretty pricey, too boot, so I should have returned it in the first couple of weeks but now the 30 day return policy is over. UPDATE: Turns out that I do have a bit more time for returning this item so yes, it's going back).The camera is not easy to use nor is it easy to navigate.  For us, a touch screen on a digital is just not necessary (which is our fault because I didn't realize it had a touch screen when we purchased it).  One slight flick of the screen and you're into another place that you didn't want to go which can easily happen at any time.  Taking pictures is okay although I don't like the  delay on this camera when doing so because you're much more likely to move  slightly when waiting for the picture to finally take!Overall, it's a huge disappointment because when I want to take a picture quickly I want to turn on my camera and click away, not have to go through a series of problems before I can begin.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R156CECZEA0S6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is without a doubt the best compact digital camera I've owned. My last two cameras were a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 and a Canon Powershot SD900.I bought the panasonic about a year ago, but it kept having problems opening and closing its lens, especially if I went to a beach or anywhere there was dust: dust would get into the mechanics and gum them up for days.This camera is ruggedized: it says it's good to 16 ft underwater, and also that it's dust proof. Best of all, it's SMALL. It's smaller than our Panasonic was, and I think perhaps about the same size as the Powershot was.The best thing about this camera is the image quality. It's a 16 megapixel camera, so I expected to be able to take 5 MP pictures without degredation. I just got back from Disneyland where we took 600 pictures and a couple hours of video using the camera. The video is amazingly good quality for a compact camera, and I believe it's close in quality to my dedicated canon camcorder. The still shots are also amazing. While not quite as good as a digital SLR, they blow away any of the pictures from my previous compact digital cameras in terms of quality. I took some 16 megapixel shots of the Storybook land ride in disney during the day, and I was shocked at how good the detail was. Even blowing the images up, they looked crystal clear with relatively little in the way of artifacts. Otherwise I shoot at 5 MP resolution and am very pleased with the results.The movies range from I believe 720p up to 1020i or 1020p. I used it in the lowest resolution and was stunned by the frame rate and quality.Caveats I've seen in other reviews hold true: it takes a few seconds for movies to start recording once you press the 'record' button, and a few seconds for them to finish recording (though actual data stops when you press 'record' to stop recording. It does pretty well at night, though like most camera's it'll do a much better job with subjects that stay still than those that move.Reviews I read were mixed on the touch screen. For my part, I like it. Now that I'm learning my way around the menu's, the touch screen is convenient, and quick to change options.It has an auto-panorama option which was a lot of fun. I turned left, then click the shutter once in auto-panorama mode and slowly turn until i'm facing right. The camera combines all the information it gathered and makes a panorama, then shows it to you right on the camera. Awesome!Overall I am extremely satisfied with this camera, and looking forward to using it at the beach and near / in pools without worrying about it breaking!I've had the camera for 2 weeks, and used it perhaps 8 hours.

Since then, I've used it repeatedly in the ocean, pouring rain, pools, snow, fine sand beaches, in clubs and at parties, and in geothermal and volcanic environments. I've dropped it on rocks and in water and in alcoholic beverages, and once, in soup! It has never, ever failed me. I carry it with me every day and every where I go, to capture the beauty of living in New Zealand. After a whole year and a half of constant use and carrying it around, there is now a tiny dent on the cover, but that is IT. I never have to worry about this camera--in situations where other people immediately try to protect and put away their cameras, I can keep shooting and not blink an eye.The reviews made me nervous, as the first time I was taking it in water I was on a once in a lifetime trip with my aging mom to the Great Barrier Reef. I sealed up the doors with electrical tape for that trip, but I've since used it without the electrical tape and it has worked great. As for snorkeling, water shots, etc., compared to the underwater cameras you can buy in tourist shops, the Sony blows them way out of the water (haha). It isn't even a contest.I think I'm most impressed with the quality of the automatic shoot mode--it usually chooses the correct settings and the first shot comes out well. I even was able to capture fireworks...on a boat...without a tripod! Excellent!The downsides are few but will eventually become annoying enough for me to replace it with another point and shoot. 1) I'm most unimpressed by the lag between shots and upon starting up--if things are happening quickly, this can get frustrating. (But then again, the camera is correcting for my poor shooting skills on the fly, so I should probably not complain about this one if I want great shots.) 2) the touchscreen sometimes takes a while, and a few taps, to register. Again, if you want to catch a shot but have to take the time to change modes, it is annoying to have to wait longer than if you had a turn-dial to change settings. 3) I can't seem to play videos with any video software anymore...I only get sound. I'm still working on that one. 4) The panoramic mode is too wide and not tall enough. I never use it.I wish it had manual settings for me to play with, and I wish I could switch easily to a wide lens, but that is all I'm missing from the settings. I'm still learning new tricks with it, even after a year.All in all, excellent product for what you pay and for the freedom that the camera gives you to shoot in varied conditions.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good waterproof camera", "Author": "GregNYC", "ReviewID": "R21ODDZV3I0SOG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a camera that was wateproof and easy to use for a sailing race across the North Pacific Ocean and this camera worked very well, albeit briefly.

Being a college freshman, majoring in Graphic Design and Journalism, she wanted to bring a camera to concerts, parties, the beach, fraternity parties etc. so it was likely to suffer some wear and tear.  But, she'd also like to be able to use it for her classes, meaning that it had to be technologically advanced, since she uses photo editing software for her academic work.  The camera needed to take good quality pictures both inside and outside, at night and during the day.  She goes to college in Boston, so it needed to be able to endure the snow and cold temperatures. Plus, it needed to fit in the pocket of her very skinny jeans.  With 2 kids in college and one going next year, I was on a strict $300 max budget.  Not an easy task!!!!  After much research (more than I did for her \"big\" camera...which, by the way, she adores), I decided on the Sony Cyber-Shot.  After a month of experimentation, I must say that the picture quality is terrific, the size is great, and the fact that it's waterproof and shock resistant gives it that much coveted \"wow\" factor that every self respecting college freshman is looking for.  It is user friendly for the person who wants it simple, but there's enough \"umph\" in it for the person who knows their way around a camera and the editing software that perplexes most of us. The true test will come when she tests it out under water while on vacation in the Caribbean in a month.

I got this camera to replace my kodak z1285 and z7590 point and shoot camera. Its A LOT better than those. I know everyone keeps saying bad things about the slide down cover, its not as bad as they say. so, here's a list of things that are great about this camera.  1) taking pictures either still or panoramic, or macro, or whatever pictures, it is very easy and it has an intelligent picture mode (very nice). In high-resolution panoramic mode you can take pictures up to 40 something megapixels!!! I've tried it, it's awesome.  2) the touch-screen works better than i thought it would. (again, people writing bad reviews about the touch-screen being unresponsive). it comes with a small pen like thing for the touch-screen if you don't want to use your fingers. works great and makes switching between modes very easy. 3) the videos on this camera are AMAZING! they are life-like when you're viewing them on the camera. (i always use the FX AVCHD 24M 60i 1080 mode). it says you can only burn it on blue ray discs and not regular dvds. :)  and if you want to upload a video to youtube from it, which took me a while to figure out how to do on a mac, you find the file named PRIVATE then find STREAM and the video files with audio included should have .mts on the end. they take FOREVER (at least 2 1/2 hours) for a 4 minute clip to upload. or if you wanted a less quality 720p video uploaded from a mac, you could use imovie and export it as a quicktime movie. I prefer to let people see what this camera can do, so i don't mind if it takes longer to upload. although, there is a free downloadable software on koyotesoftdotcom that converts the AVCHD/mts2 files to any other format. its called free hd converter. 4) i tested it under water and it works great. EVERY TIME you turn on the camera it reminds you to shut the battery compartment and the door for the hdmi, so if it gets fried under water then, its probably your own fault. i've only had it for about a week and still need to learn all the features on it.

That camera took fantastic photos of everything... from sports to night shots and especially underwater. Unfortunately, I literally lost that camera in the middle of a lake last month. I am not a professional photographer. We own 4 other cameras, ranging from a Nikon CoolPix to a Canon PowerShot. I know nothing about shutter speeds, noise, etc. I literally change the scene settings on the camera and that is about it.We have had this Sony DSC-TX10 about 5 days now and I have tested it out as best I could. The only thing I have not tested is the underwater feature because weather didn't cooperate this past weekend. That being said, this camera takes beautiful pictures! The colors are very vivid and bright. I LOVE the touchscreen features (They will not work underwater. You have to disable the touch screen near water and use the actual buttons on the camera {there aren't many} otherwise the water droplets can change settings.) The camera does need a few seconds to warm up, so don't expect to turn it on and take a shot a second later. It took 3-4 seconds before I could take a photo.If I find any other shortcomings, I will amend this review. For now, I give it 5 stars. It is extremely lightweight and small enough to fit in a small pocket.As a side note, we also purchased the Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-BN1, Cyber-shot DSC-T99, DSC-T110, DSC-TX5, DSC-TX7, DSC-TX9, DSC-TX10, DSC-TX100V, DSC-W310, DSC-W320, DSC-W330, DSC-W350, DSC-W360, DSC-W380, DSC-W390, DSC-W510, DSC-W515PS, DSC-W520, DSC-W530, DSC-W550...and the Chums Waterproof Camera Float Chums Waterproof Camera Float.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony - No Baloney - Simple and it works", "Author": "J.

However, after I used it for a couple of months, and, got used to its features, I decided that five stars was more appropriate.My first \"point and shoot\" is an ancient SONY DSC T33 (5.1 Mp) Sony Cybershot DSCT33 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Docking Station) I bought about five years ago.  It is a little beat up, but, it has worked really well, and, continues to work really well.  I love it.  I wouldn't have bought a new camera except I misplaced it for a few months and needed a new one.This camera DSC-TX10, provides three times the resolution, and I am really happy with the higher resolution.  It's hard to take a bad picture because, with the high resolution, you can electronically crop most photos into award-winning pictures, and the remaining cropped image still has plenty of resolution.This is a camera you can stick in your pocket, and, take with you, all the time.  It is compact, lightweight, sturdy enough to take jolts, bumps and an occasional fall.  You can keep it in \"easy mode\" for almost instant \"point and shoots\", and, it will stay in easy mode until you exit into the more complicated functions.  I cherish the simplicity.  I have 22 years of education, and, many years of technical experience.  I am no \"technophobe\".

However, once it was delivered, I was a bit disappointed.1) The sample pics: misleading. The color is not the same shown in those pictures, or even in the sony website.  In reality is much darker, it's actually the same color that the Lumix TS1. I still like it, but I would have chosen another color if I've known this little detail.2) The camera itself is very compact, and it looks well made, the materials used seem to be of high quality however it does not seem like it can take a fall from 1.5m! It seems too delicate! I am actually thinking the front lid/lens cover will break or come off if I accidentally drop the camera -which has happened to me before and it's the reason I wanted this camera in the first place-.3) I have not tried it in the water yet, however based on the manual that comes with the specific instructions for use underwater, it does seem like any tiny mistake from my part will break the thing! I am actually a bit afraid of using it underwater since I'm not located in the US and I cannot use my warranty if it breaks. I also did not like the fact that you can't use the touch screen underwater.4) The pictures are great, I really love the backlight correction feature, and the scene mode pics look awesome. The sweep panorama feature it's really nice and was actually one of the main reasons I purchased the camera. The video quality is great too. As far as picture/video quality goes, I am 100% happy with it.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, I think most of my discomfort /doubts comes from the fact that I've used a Lumix TS1, and that one looks so much strong/rugged than this one....", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "False Advertisement - The camera is not shockproof.", "Author": "YCD", "ReviewID": "R185IFIAU99H8H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just got off the call from Sony repair service and fuming with anger and disappointment.

I told them my camera was dropped on my wooden floor from a height of less than 2 ft. Then the guy told me 'Sony does not know what force was applied during the fall'.
