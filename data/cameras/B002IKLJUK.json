{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally The Digital Camera Holy Grail", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "RAJCY9LBG3UB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line up front:  The elusive compact camera with interchangeable lenses, DLSR Image Quality, DSLR Focusing speed and DSLR performance has finally been made.  It is the GF1.I live in Japan so I have been lucky enough to have been playing with this camera since 18 Sep.  This camera sold out on the first day from Bic Camera in Japan so it is going to be hard to get a hold of one.  Please be aware that this camera is \"region\" coded so if you buy a Japanese version you will not be able to change the menu language to English.This review is equally applicable to both versions of the GF1.  I personally prefer the 20MM (40MM equivalent) f1.7 lens to the 14-45MM (28-90MM equivalent) f3.5-5.6 lens for the following reasons: 1)  Since the m43 is relatively small compared to a full frame sensor you need a fast lens to get shallow depth of fields.  2) As a fast lens it is far more usable in low light situations.  This lens is ~2 to 3.5 f stops faster than the 14-45MM lens.  What this means is that given a certain situation, if you were to select the same shutter speed you would let in 4-11 times more light (Each full f stop change changes the light by 2. Going to a small f stop doubles the light. Therefore, you arrive at how much more light there is by raising 2 to the number of f stops. 2^2=4 and 2^3.5 =11) allowing the use of a lower ISO setting or you could set a 4-11 times faster shutter speed to allow you to prevent motion blurring.  3) This lens is smaller so it makes the camera eminently more portable.  What you give up is the ability to zoom with your hand.  There is a work around for this and it is called zooming with you feet.  However, in confined situations, you may not be able to move back are far as you need to.  If this is the type shooting you routinely do then the 14-45MM zoom is probably for you.  For me, and I believe for most people, I like the great flexibility the faster lens gives me and I am not usually constrained by space.  Additionally, the 20MM lens, in my non-scientific tests, appears to focus faster than the zoom.  Both focus fast but the 20MM feels faster.STILLSThis camera along with the G1 and GH1 has the best contrast detection autofocus on the market.  It is as fast if not faster than my Nikon D40 and is almost as fast as my D700.  This is a great technological breakthrough and is what allows the camera to be smaller than a DSLR while giving nearly identical performance.  With this camera you will not miss photos of your children or other fast moving subjects while you wait for your camera to focus.  Bravo.On top of the great focusing performance , this fresh design allows this camera to handle exceedingly well.  In many ways it takes the best of the point-and-shoot (P+S) world and mixes it with the best of the DSLR world.  It doesn't have as many dedicated buttons as my D700 but the Q Menu system works very well and allows for quick changes of most shooting parameters.  There is a detailed menu system but I don't find myself using it very much while shooting.  I feel that this setup allows photographers moving up from the P+S world to feel immediately comfortable on this camera while also giving experienced photographers the control they need to work their craft.  It seems many reviewers find fault with the Panasonic one control click wheel that changes aperture and shutter speed (other cameras have two wheels or have a button and 1 wheel combination).  I actually prefer the click wheel on this camera.  With the other types of setups (which I have on the D700 -- two wheels and D40 -- 1 wheel plus button) I usually have to look away from the scene to find the other wheel or button.  With the setup on this camera my finger is already close by the wheel and I just push it to change functions.I don't know what kind of plastic Panasonic uses on this camera but I love the way it looks and feels.  Also, I think having a red, white, or grey camera is cool (unfortunately only available in black in the US.  The G1 was available in multiple colors but so far the GH1 and GF1 are \"available in any color as long as it is black.\") and this combined with its size makes it look more like a \"consumer\" camera rather than a \"professional\" camera.  With the photographer unfriendly laws proliferating the world, it is nice to have an incredibly capable camera that doesn't look like a professional camera.This is a micro-4/3s camera system.  That has some pros and cons.  The chip is smaller than most DSLR chips.  A full frame (FX in Nikon speak) sensor is ~860 sq mm, a Nikon DX sensor is ~370 sq mm, the 4/3 sensor is ~225 sq mm, and the typical sensor used in a point and shoot range between ~25-50 sq mm.  However, a 2/3 sensor like many TV shows are shot with is ~60 sq mm and a 1/4 sensor like most home video recorders is only ~10 sq mm.  What does all of these numbers mean?  From a \"stills\" perspective the 4/3 format is relatively small when compared to DSLRs.  That means that for the same megapixel rating, the 4/3 sensor will have smaller photoreceptors and that means more noise.  However, the 4/3 sensor is roughly 60% of a DX chip so while this is a great physics discussion, in real life you will not be able to tell the noise difference based on sensor size even with a picture blown up to 100%.  This is born out by the GF1's excellent noise control up to ISO800.  You can also still use shots taken at ISO 1600 and 3200 but those low light shots are usually better turned into black and whites for that noire grainy look.  That is the \"downside\" (not really much of a downside especially when compared to the up side) of the micro 4/3 system.  The upside is that because you have a smaller area to cover, you can make lenses smaller (less weight and less cost).  You also get a 2x multiplication factor on your lenses.  So now that 200mm lens gives you 400mm of reach.  Yea.  However, a down side of the 2x multiplication side is if you want to shoot wide.  You need a 7mm lens to get a 14mm viewing angle and those can get pretty expensive (panasonic makes are really nice and small 7-14mm that is more expensive than this camera).  The point of all of this mumbo jumbo is that this camera takes great pictures and the lenses are smaller than DSLR lenses.  Less weight and smaller size with no practical image quality compromise equals great camera.On thing that is a negative is the slow 1/160 flash sync speed.  This will be very limiting for off camera flash during bright light.  With such a slow sync it will be exceedingly difficult (impossible?) to get shallow depth of fields while lighting.  Most people probably won't use this feature but for those that do it will be a bummer. (Super FP mode and ND filters can help with this though)This camera, also, does not have in Camera IS.  The IS is in the lenses.  The reason that Canon, Nikon, Panasonic do this is they say on-lens IS performs better.  From what I have seen that is a true statement.  However, in camera IS is better than no IS.  Also, this camera can mount lens from numerous other systems.  None of those will have IS.  If you have an on board IS, then all of those other lenses will now have IS.  The Olympus E-P1 does have in camera IS.  The camera has many flaws but that is a benefit.  Also, the E-P2 is supposed to be announce on 31 Oct 09 so hopefully many of the flaws of the E-P1 will be fixed.I also love the face recognition on this camera.  When I am taking group photos, the faces that I really care about are my families'.  Now I can register 6 peoples' faces and it will focus on them.  NiceVIDEOIn many ways, this camera lacks some of the features of a dedicated video recorder and doesn't do the 1080P of the GH1 or have the manual shutter speed control.  So why would I want to use this camera for video.  There are two main reasons.  The first  reason is Depth of Field (DOF).  As I mentioned earlier the micro 4/3 sensor has 4 times more area than the 2/3 sensor used for many TV shows and is 22 times more area than many video recorders.  Smaller sensors = larger DOF.  This makes it harder to isolate your subject from the background by having the background out of focus.  Pay attention to movies when you watch them and you will notice how they shift focus to \"highlight\" their subject.  If you have wondered why you can't do that with a home video recorder, now you know.  If you shoot with a F4 lens on a 4/3 system you will need a .8 aperture on a 1/4 system to get the same DOF (by the way there is no such home video recorder).  The second major reason to use the GH1 is the ability to change lenses.  Right now there are not many micro 4/3 lenses.  However, the micro 4/3 format is so flexible that, with an adaptor you can use just about any camera lens you want (Nikon, Canon, Leica, etc).  The trade off is that you lose autofocus with most non-4/3 lenses.  The ability to change lenses grants two major benefits.  First, you can put all sorts of exotic lenses on.  For example if you put on a 7mm lens, you would give your video a perspective not often seen in home footage.  On a 1/4 sensor of a video recorder you would need a 1.4mm lens to get the same perspective as the 7mm on the 4/3 system.  (Most camcorders are not going to go wider than 4mm which is roughly equivalent to a 20mm lens on a 4/3 system.)  Secondly, you can put exceedingly \"fast\" (a fast lens is one with a low aperture number.  A lower aperture number means more light hitting the sensor so you can run your shutter speed faster.  Hence fast lens) lenses on to get shallow DOF.  You could easily put a f1.4 lens on this camera.  You would need a f0.3 lens to get the equivalent DOF on a 1/4 sensor.Anyway, it is relatively easy to make beautiful videos with this camera.  It does not do 1080P.  However, I don't think that will be a loss to most.  The GH1 1080P files are much bigger, require more post work to achieve really good results, and, from normal sitting distances, most people can't tell the difference between 720P and 1080P.  Also, in the movie mode you can set aperture but the camera will set the shutter speed automatically.  This leads to a caveat that you need to be aware of when shooting movies with this camera.  If you want to use the wider apertures in bright light to get the smaller depth of fields then you will need some neutral density filters to put over the lens.  As a rule of thumb you want your shutter speed to be twice the frame rate.  So you need to shoot at 1/120.  On a bright day at f1.7 you could easily need 1/9600 to properly expose at ISO200 (Well beyond the camera 1/4000 shutter limit).  5 to 6 Stops of ND would get the camera to set the shutter speed around 1/120.  If you just set the camera on automatic it will take care of the exposure for you so you can just press the record button and go.  However, one of the reasons to step up to a camera like this is take some control for yourself and create some art from within.I will finish this review by making some comparison between some other camera choices out there.First, this camera works very similar to the G1 and GH1 so what people have said about those cameras applies to the GF1.  The big difference is the GF1 is smaller, the G1 doesn't do video, the GH1 can do 1080P, the GF1 does not come with a Electronic View FInder, the GF1 separate EVF is not in the same league with the G1 and GH1, and finally, the GF1 does not have an articulated screen like the G1 and GH1 do.GF1 vs GH1 vs G1  vs Olympus PEN E-P1  vs Canon G11 (Not yet released)GF1Pros:Smallest camera in the world with DSLR performanceBlazing focus performanceGreat Picture QualityHD 720P video capabilityCompatibility with nearly every lens every made including Leica, Nikon, Canon, etc (you do need to purchase an adaptor to do this and you do lose auto focus in most instances)Great HandlingCons:No built in EVF (add on not in the same league as G1 and GH1)Live View screen not articulatedHard to findRelatively expensiveOnly Black in the USWho's it for?:  Anyone who want to have a small compact and lightweight camera that packs the performance and features of DSLR.

(I personally prefer the GF1 but there are a lot of people commenting on how nice the PEN looks)Cons:Abysmal focus performance (worse than most point and shoot cameras)No flashIncredibly poor low res live view screen (The GF1 has twice the resolution as the E-P1)(I would really only recommend this camera to someone who has lenses from other systems that is looking to make them Image Stabilized and is willing to manually focus them.)Who's it for?  Anyone who wants to have a small compact and lightweight camera with great image quality, are not concerned about focus speed/flash and want to use the in camera IS to stabilize non-IS lenses.Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCDNote this camera is not out yet and I have not gotten my hands on one yet.  I have seen sample photographs from this camera however.  I was blown away with how noise free they were at ISO 3200.  I don't know if this is from aggressive noise reduction smearing detail, the decrease from 14.7 MP to 10MP or the increase in the chip size.  Either way I think it is worth considering because of the all in one aspect and low price)Pros:Smaller Size than any other camera listed hereGreat Picture Quality(??)All in one package and lens (28-140MM) no need to buy other lensesOptical View FinderArticulated Live View Screen1/2000 flash sync speed!Impeccable construction quality (Built from metal tough and heavy)Built in flashBuilt in ND filter on LensRelatively InexpensiveCons:No HD movies (640x480 is the largest movie format)Can't swap lenses (this is both a plus and minus and there are modifiers you can put on to make the lens \"wider\" or \"longer\")Small Sensor (1/1.7 sensor is only 43 square mm compared to 225 for the m43.  This usually equates to poor ISO performance all thing being equal.  It seems Canon has figured out how to make things not equal.  However, if shallow depth of fields are your thing then look elsewhere.)Who's it for?  Anyone who wants a tougher and more portable camera than any other listed here, with great(??) image quality in a all-in-one package with nothing else to buy.As I mentioned before, this camera is not out yet so you have to keep that caveat in mind.  However, after seen the ISO3200 samples, I am now strongly considering this camera.OVERALLThe Panasonic GF1 is a fantastic camera and the first to deliver on the promise of a compact camera with DSLR performance and image quality.  It obviously has places in which it can improve.  However, for the current state-of-the-art, this camera is the best performing small camera available.  Panasonic's contrast detect autofocus has raised the bar and no more excuses can be made for this type of autofocus system.  (It probably heralds the extinction of the DSLR)  Based around this, Panasonic has engineered the worlds first compact camera with \"DSLR\" level performance and has created an outstanding stills camera with good HD video camera capabilities.  It's a great time to be a photographer!", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Consumer review for consumers (i.e. parents) looking for increased photo quality", "Author": "MJC \"mjc\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3Q0CQEUC3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is really intended for parents, grandparents and non-pros who are looking for a camera that will improve the quality of their photos, without strapping a massive camera around their necks.  This is a great camera for that.Per the title, I'm not a pro or even an amateur photographer.  I had a Lumix DMC-TZ3, which is very small and has a big zooms.  It worked well for pictures of our children outside in bright light.  However, the indoor and low light quality was not as good as we wanted.  Since many of these family photos will be kept, saved, and archived for a long time, we were willing to spend some extra money IF we could find a camera that would do it and that was convenient and easy to use.As an aside, we tried a couple other point and shoot cameras (thanks to Costco's great return policy) but, with some research, realized that ever increasing megapixels and zoom were not going to help us.  We needed better lenses and bigger / better sensors.The key features that were most important to us in comparing other cameras in this price range were:1.  Improved image quality than our point-and-shoot cameras, especially capturing active children in low-light / indoor light conditions.  (We tend to turn off the flash and use room lighting so as not to stop the kids in their tracks, which ruins the spontaneous moments we are trying to capture.)2.  Able to take high quality video clips  when a photo moment would be better captured with video and audio.3.  Small enough to carry in a pocket and keep handy on a small shelf in the kitchen so that we'll actually use it.4.  Easy to use automatic settings / good auto settings, since we do not use the manual (professional) settings.We compared the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 to the Canon EOS Rebel T1i and the Nikon D90.  We ruled out the Olympus EP1 (or EP2?) early because it does not have an integrated flash.  Yes, I know I said we tend not to use it, but we do use it for \"say cheese\" portraits and a few other instances. Light usually seems to improve the quality of our photos, and having to carry and attach a big flash to the Olympus dropped it from our list early.We looked at the sample photos and photo tests available for DMC-GF1, T1i, and D90 at [...].  We also held them, turned dials, and pushed buttons at a local camera store.  We liked the color, tone, and clarity of the DMC-GF1 best as posted at dpreview.  (I imagine this is subjective.  We are not pros.)  We favored the much smaller size and weight of the DMC-GF1, too.  These were all great cameras by our standards, though.  Any of them would have greatly improved the photos of our children.  In the end, the GF1 was a clear winner for us.Quality:The DMC-GF1 has greatly increased the quality of our photos, especially the low light (but high action) ones inside the house.  We use the automatic setting most of the time, but sometimes select a scene, such as portrait or (more likely) sports.  It is ready to take pictures almost the instant it is turned on.  It can take pictures quickly with very little lag from the the time we press the button to the time the actual photo is captured.  For those of you using point and shoot cameras, this will be a huge improvement.Video:Videos look great on our 52\" screen.  There is a small button on top of this camera that is easy to locate.  It lets us immediately take a video of the photo shot we were trying to take.  Research showed that the GF1's micro-four-thirds system allows it to better focus while taking video compared to the canon and nikon because the 4/3's system does not have a mirror that has to be moved or dealt with while filming.Size:We bought the 20mm lens and tend to use it more than the larger 14mm-45mm lens.  The GF1 is not small and portable (by our standards) with the 14-56 lens, but it fits into a large pocket with the 20mm lens attached.  There is no zoom on the 20mm lens (except our feet), but the picture quality is so good that we can easily crop photos when necessary using iPhoto and still have great quality for blown up printout, such as in family calendars...Easy Automatic Settings:The camera's automatic settings are doing what they are supposed to do:  allowing us to capture great moments by automatically selecting good settings.  I don't want to mess with it.  Light still matters, but photos that our phones and point-and-shoot cameras are incapable of catching or incapable of rendering without lots of blurry noise look good.  Yes, our kids can still do things at high speed in the darkest corners, resulting in noisy, blurry pictures, but the while subjects (kids) and settings (house) have not changed, the number of throw away shots of otherwise great moments has plummeted.  We leave the camera on automatic for most shots, but sometimes turn on the flash or select a scene from the easy to use menu. (Turning on the flash is very easy, just press the button on the back of the camera (right behind the flash) and it will pop up, ready to do its thing).It's not perfect for us, but it's great.  Ideally, it would be even smaller, cheaper, with a powerful zoom, and would never miss a shot.  Still, we feel it was the best value for our money, and we have been delighted with the photos.[UPDATE: After three months of shooting with this camera, I wish I had purchased it earlier.  Our digital photos look so much better.  The big sensor and high quality lenses are really making a difference.  We are overfilling our relatives' mailboxes with good shots.  Very, very happy with this purchase.

Fuller's Review is quite extensive - so I can only add that after one day of producing test shots - still life and landscape, that this is my favorite digital camera so far. I have owned quite a few - ever since digicam's hit the 2 megapixel mark, including camera's with very different sensor technology, and even the leica M8. I look at lens and image quality first, build quality and features / usability and price, and for the money, the GF1 is a real winner. I also have a Sigma DP-1, and while I really love it - it suffers the same issues as the EP-1. Really nice cameras, but with shortcomings that are just a bit too much to justify (IMHO).I have been a huge fan of the Leica designed lenses on just about all of the Panasonic Lumix cameras, and their OIS is quite amazing.If my Sigma DP-1 had the fast focus and responsiveness of the GF1, and if it has a zoom lens with _some_ range, it would have held the top shelf position. I have replaced my Panasonic Lumix FZ-50 with the GF1 with the 14-45mm lens, and it is the first digicam that meets or exceeds every requirement I have - including DSLR image quality in a small but very rugged / built like a tank package. I must admit - the lens on the FZ-50 was a real work of art - its range and quality for what it did at that price point was simply a killer deal.But the GF1 is the latest in a great set of Panasonic products.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very very nice product", "Author": "Frederick Lee \"Freddy\"", "ReviewID": "R27YU6V12PQA5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all,for those of you who are hesitating, I would say you're safe to go.I bought Olympus EP1 on the very first day of appearance.But it didn't take more than week to return it.

It's really a shame Panasonic didn't deliver on manual controls and a 24P frame rate, because this camera would a viable choice for high end ultra portable film-making. I can live with 720P, but the inability to set ISO and shutter speed makes me crazy. It can take pretty stunning video, but you have to be very careful with changing light values. You are able to focus manually however (again, why not go the whole way?!)Panasonic?Are you listening?Could you please upgrade the firmware?I thought you guys made the 4/3rds system specifically for still and moving acquisition?The other thing I hate is the wheel used for shutter/aperture. I used a G9/10 for the last three years and I MUCH prefer it's exposure wheel.Otherwise I'm very happy. The noise is low, the shutter delay is very fast, as is auto focus, and it has a 7 exposure auto bracket mode. The drive modes also have their own hardware selector by the function mode knob. The noise is acceptable to about 1600 ISO, which amazes me as it's body is only a little larger than my G10. I try to never shoot above 400 on the G10.

Later I bought the 20mm f/1.7 Pancake Lens separately and I found I keep the pancake lens on the camera most of the time, as it's much more compact and convenient to carry with me. I also recommend the Lowepro Apex 60 AW (Black) bag that fits perfectly the camera with the pancake lens (no space for the 14-45mm lens however).The 14-45mm kit is very practical, but gives only a short 3x zoom. Better range you can find on the Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0-5.8 lens, however that's much more expensive.Overall, highly recommended camera if you're looking for something with much better image quality than point-and-shoot or super-zooms, but don't want to carry the bulk of a D-SLR camera.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for an Old Guy !", "Author": "Bass Lake \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R2ASFZPAL9O6YC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an 'old fart' and come from the now very old world of film cameras.I grew up in 4x5 sheet film and still think 35mm format is a 'toy' .. But since I can no longer effectively use my old 120 roll film cameras like the Zeiss Super Ikonta and Hasses' what to do?I am an amateur with my only requirement being to document my RV trips and the back-country 4WD adventures and the 'less than 5 mile' day hikes, so I may as well use one of these new fangled digital cameras.I always thought my old Nikon F bodies were too heavy for the result they gave and now the new breed of 10 pound DSLRs are even worse yet.  It's the same bad trade off today as it was in 1965, nothing has really changed.  A ten pound  mirror slapping monster with a one ounce result.The GF1 is very much like my old M2 Leica rangefinder.  It has all the benefits of the  rangefinders, none of the SLR drawbacks.  Faster than lightening to bring into play, very responsive, excellent fit and feel in the hand, and very well thought out in design and manufacture. A one pound camera with a ten pound result !  Rangefinder 35mm of this style and design are the ultimate 'candid' and street cameras, and they can not be beat on the trail unless you are hiking with a pack burro to help you along.If you are looking for a modern camera that will do the job the old Leicas' did then this is the one for you.  The lens and the sensor and the resultant image quality is excellent. You will have no problem up to 11x14 prints and perhaps beyond.  I noticed in the excellent dpreview review of this camera that they have some minor moans and complaints about the JPEG engine in the camera. I do not agree with them on this point. If you set the 'my film' settings in the GF1 correctly you can get an almost indistinguishable color result against the RAW.  Admittedly you loose some image information in the JPEG, and have to experiment a little with it, but once you develop a 'my film' profile for various standard shooting situations then you are good to go and save yourself the later workload of the RAW development.The Japanese software that is supplied as a freebie with the camera is excellent, and very sophisticated. You will not have to buy $300 worth of junk from Adobe unless you want to. Once you get over the 'translation chuckles' of the various menu items in the software you will have a powerful tool in your hands. Admittedly there is a learning curve with any software of this complexity, but it is doable and is a significant value added bonus to the price of the camera.When even the GF1 is too heavy for me to take on the trail, I pocket my Cannon S90.  There is no comparison between the image quality of the Micro 4/3s and the little chip in the Cannon. It is the difference between night and day, apples and oranges.  If you are one of those that are tired of the 'almost' image quality of your little pocket digital camera but do not want all the same old - same old SLR negatives, then I don't think you could do better than the GF1. Of course this Micro 4/3 world is just in it infancy and and you will probably watch the world pass you by a little as new cameras of this class are released over the next few years, but you will be taking great shots with it now, and having great fun as well.If you are one that used to use, appreciated, and understood rangefinders like the old Leicas, and  now watch, with disbelief,  the endless profusion of so-called  \"pro grade DSLRs \" pour out of Japan then you need to have a close look at the GF1.

Indoor shots needed tweaking, and not so fast as I was expecting. Without the viewfinder, which hasn't been released yet, I was leaning toward returning it for a dslr.On to this week and the real life testing - fabulous performance. I used the scene mode, the intelligent auto and the custom program where you can choose the settings like a fully manual camera at each event so I could get more of a feel for the camera.  School field trip - great pictures. Volleyball tournament - great pictures. Tried out the video at the playground, great picture quality, great sound quality and you can zoom without any external sound. The autofocus kept the picture in focus when zooming in video perfectly. The autofocus tracking and face recognition worked wonders when trying to get candids of little girls running around on a school field trip. The auto bracketing feature worked great when dealing with a gusty, cloudy day with changing light conditions. The one stop switch to black and white from color allowed for some interesting shots with an easy on/off adjustment.  The high speed burst mode caught all the shots I could want or need.  The size was great, easy to carry in hand, not too heavy on my neck when I had to use my hands for other things.Is it perfect? No, the manual focus is really hard to handle, especially indoors (very grainy, hard to get a clear picture) but this may be different when the viewfinder arrives. After the burst mode, there is a recovery which could cause a problem in a fast moving situation but I did not find it a problem with my situation. I don't find the intelligent auto very good at indoor shots unless you are using the flash, but that may be a learning curve issue.Overall, it is a very expensive camera, but it appears to work as well as many of the dslrs on the market (with the exception of the shooting speed). It works well at the easy point and shoot mode and also works well with fully manual settings. It fits really well in a purse with the 14-45 lense and I can't wait for the pancake to arrive.*************Update 10/13/09********Camera is still working great and is more rugged than I had hoped.

However I'm not sure I would strongly recommend this for the casual consumer who just wants some nice 4X6 images of the family with an occasional enlargement.  While the GF1 is superior to point and shoots, it is also more expensive and complicated.  The instructions need to be read over carefully several times if you want to successfully use many of the neat options.

Panasonic is a better camera, no doubt, but they completely missed the boat with image stabilization. And I mean completely. Seems that they forgot why the 4/3m was created in the first place, and it was to make compact SLR for enthusiasts, not just professionals. That means a compact all-in-one camera for pics and video. Compact is the key word here, and without in-body image stabilization the only option for video is the Panasonic zoom lens with the MEGA O.I.S., which is huge. The 20mm pancake lens is fantastic for pics, but it does not have IS and you will not be able to shoot free hand video with it. Would you buy a camcorder without IS? I would not.With zoom lens GF1 is nearly as large as a regular SLR, so what's the point? Olympus E-P1 has in-body IS, you can carry it around with just the pancake lens and get all the shots and video you want. Without optical IS built into the lens Olympus produced a collapsible zoom lens that is much smaller, even with it attached E-P1 is still pretty compact. For those who don't care as much about the size of the camera it will seem that I'm obsessed. True, but if not for size, why even consider GF1? Full size SLR will be cheaper and better.Olympus has shortcomings too, slower auto-focus, no af assist light to make it even worse, no built-in flash. But I'd rather carry the small flash than the huge lens.

I love my Canon 20D, but I mostly take it hiking and on trips, and I have to tell you, I get seriously tried of carrying it sometimes. With a large lens, it's even worse - with my favored hiking lens, my wide angle, my camera weights 2.7 pounds. I have no interest, however, in going back to the low quality of point-and-click, and I love shooting in manual mode. I also like the option to switch between a large aperture fixed lens and a more flexible zoom lens.As far as I can tell, one of the biggest driver behind image quality (besides the skill of the photographer) in a well-made camera is the size of the sensor. I haven't done my own tests, but I'm pretty sure sensor size - and by extension, lens size - is the bottom line. Most consumer digital SLRs have a sensor of size 330 mm^2. The best point-and-clicks on the market, such as the Canon G10, have sensors no larger than 43 mm^2. That means that lower-level DSLRs have nearly 8 times as much sensor area. The Panasonic GF1, on the other hand, has a sensor that is 225 mm^2, or two-thirds the size of a DSLR sensor and more than five times the sensor size of the best compact.Now, on to weight. The 20D weighs 1.5 pounds. The G10 weighs 0.77 pounds . . . and the GF1 weights 0.63 pounds - the lightest of the three. This is extraordinary when you consider that the GF1 has a sensor 2/3 the size of the 20D. Less than half the weight and 2/3 the sensor size - what a bargain. Compacts might be 1/3 or less the weight of a 20D, but they have 1/8 or less the sensor size - not such a good deal.Now, because the GF1 sensor is smaller than the 20D, the lenses are also significantly lighter. It's hard to compare lens weights, since lens weight goes with quality as well as size, but the 20 mm lens that comes with the camera is only 1 inch long and weights 4.5 ounces - despite being solidly constructed and high quality. The 14 - 45 mm lens weighs only 6.9 ounces and is also petite compared to the 18-105 mm zoom lens I use on my DSLR.Despite the obvious weight and size advantages of the camera, I had a few major concerns.1.) Going mirrorless means losing the ability to look through the lens via an optical viewfinder. You can buy an optional digital viewfinder for the GF1, but it's not very good quality. Some of the other larger and/or more expensive mirrorless cameras come with better viewfinders.I ended up buying the viewfinder, but I think I used it once. First, the viewfinder is desirable over live preview if it's very bright, but I don't spend a lot of time in very bright situations. In a recent vacation to Japan - days and days of taking pictures - I can only think of a couple of occasions when I missed having an optical viewfinder. In fact, after a few days, I came to prefer live preview, and now when I'm using my 20D, I miss it. In fact, I'm probably going to try and sell the digital viewfinder I bought.2.) Because the sensor is smaller, performance at high ISO settings is poorer. Most people said that ISOs above 400 were unacceptable, whereas they considered ISO 800 acceptable on a DSLR. Personally, I find ISO 800 basically unacceptable on my 20D, so I was worried I'd find ISO 400 unacceptable on the GF1, and be limited to ISO 100 and ISO 200, which would be annoying.On my trip, I really felt I had no choice but to use ISO 400 regularly given various low light situations. I was pleased to find when I came home and reviewed my pictures at ISO 400, that the noise levels were acceptable to me. I've continued to use ISO 400 regularly in low light situations and have been pleased with the results. See here, here, and here, for example.3.) The GF1 has only one control wheel, and it's small. On the 20D, I like to take all my pictures, or most of them anyway, in Manual mode. Having one dial seems quite limiting. The 20D has two large, easy to turn control wheels.The GF1 dial *is* small, and I found that taking pictures in manual was annoying. I just couldn't get to the setting I wanted quickly enough to please me. I ended up switching to aperture priority. By toggling the adjustment - how much lighter or darker than the meter thinks is nominal - you basically control shutter speed and aperture anyway. However, you start in the right ballpark, as opposed to having to quickly shuttle from one end of the shutter speed range to the other manually if switching from light to dark conditions. Once I got used to it, I was perfectly happy taking pictures in Aperture priority mode, and found the single dial adequate. However, and larger, easier to turn dial would be an improvement to the camera.4.) I was concerned about the camera being fast enough for me in focusing and turning on and off and so on.Speed is acceptable. This camera is not a great option for sports events or puppies, but for most uses, it's perfectly adequate. Taking tourist and family photos, I didn't even notice that it was a bit smaller than a DSLR. It was only when I was trying to photograph my mother-in-law's new baby puppy that I realized that it was slower and struggled a little bit. It's much faster than the Olympus alternative. It's much, much faster than the last compact I used.Why the GF1?As I said, I was immediately excited by the concept of mirrorless cameras. When I bought mine, Olympus had the E-PL1, E-P1 and E-P2 on the market. Panasonic had the G1, GH1, G2, GH2, GF1, and came out with the GF2 shortly after I bought mine. Sony had a released the NEX3 and the NEX5, and Samsung had a couple of options on the market.I quickly narrowed it down to Olympus and Panasonic. Both the Sony and Samsung cameras were generally panned by reviewers, and both actually have full-size sensors. Full-size sensor is good, in that quality is better, but it means full-size lenses, and I'm looking for a lighter option. A tiny camera with a giant lens, such as the NEX 5 does not appeal to me. Sony's cameras were also aimed at the previous point-and-click user, and were very menu-driven. Apparently, several button clicks were required just to change the ISO.I then went to a camera store and tried several Olympus and Panasonic models. The Olympus models were very slow to focus - unacceptably slow in my opinion. I was not interested in a slow camera, so I immediately dropped Olympus from the running, though I'd been leaning towards their models originally. Apparently, Olympus' latest model, the E-PL2, is 30% faster to focus, but I wouldn't buy an Olympus mirrorless camera at this point without trying it out and making sure it was fast enough to suit me.This left a myriad of Panasonic options - the G1, GH1, G2, G10, GH2 and GF1. I eliminated the G1 because it did not have video capability. While I'm not super into video, mirrorless cameras are known to be excellent for video, and it's just a capability I enjoy having. The G1 was also one of Panasonic's oldest mirrorless models, so I wanted to take advantage of other minor advancements that had been made. This left the GH1, G2, G10, GH2 and GF1. At the time, the GH2 was out of stock and significantly more expensive than the others, so eliminated it. The GH2 is a very nice camera, and prices have come down a bit, so I'd consider it if I was in the market now. The GH1 was also quite expensive at the time and not widely available.This left the G2, G10 and GF1. The G2 and G10 had some additional features that the GF1 lacked, such as an articulating display screen. The G10 was a bit less expensive. However, the GF1 weighed significantly less, and I liked the look and feel of it. Basically, I just I think any of the cameras would have been a fine choice, but my gut said GF1, so I went with it.Basically, in summary, I'm delighted with my GF1. For any application other than shooting wildlife (or anything else requiring telephoto capabilities) or fast-moving children or puppies, I prefer it to my DSLR for its compactness.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon DSLR owner now loves the GF1 more", "Author": "J.

First the Digital Rebel 300D and presently the 30D with lots of nice glass.  But it's all heavy and big and somtimes stays home because I don't want to lug it around.  On those occasions in the past I took a Canon Powershot, but now the GF1 is my best friend!I've only had the camera for a couple of weeks, but I'm already totally impressed with it.  I love the size, weight, features and picture quality.  The 14-45 kit lens is plenty sharp for me.  In fact, I think the pure focus accuracy coming from the GF1 CMOS imager is probably better than Canon using a separate focusing sensor that must be critically aligned to guarantee excellent focus at the CMOS imager itself.  What does that mean?  It means perfect focus with a decent lens will give a better picture than mediocre focus with L glass.  Think about that!  I also bought the 45-200 Lumix lens and love it.  It focuses very close (1m) even at 200mm (a 400mm equivalent).  Nice bokeh, too!I love the ability to shoot multiple formats including 1:1 (same aspect as some of the old medium format cameras).  The ability to compose using those formats live on the excellent LCD is great!My only suggested improvement would be some rubber in the hand grip area.  For people that want a better grip for one handed shooting, you might prefer a GH1 or similar, but I chose the GF1 because I wanted the classic rangefinder look.I also love the ability to adapt old manual focus lenses to the GF1.  I bought adapters and now can use my old Canon FD lenses and the manual focus is nicely assisted by a highly magnified view on the LCD.  There is no focus confirmation \"beep\", but you can tell on the LCD when critical focus is reached.  It works better than using a focus confirm chip with manual focus lenses on the 30D.  Somehow I never hit precise focus on my 30D even though those focus confirm adapters give me a good beep.So, all in all, the GF1 has really impressed me and may completely displace my DSLR equipment.  Perhaps I'll be selling it all someday soon.If you're all about brand name and the \"professional\" appearance of a DSLR then keep lugging all that gear around.  But for me, I think I'll be filling out my micro 4/3 lens collection and only keeping the most essential pieces of my DSLR collection.But wait, maybe Canon will do the right thing and create a APS-C camera like the GF1 that will accept a compact set of EOS lenses and all the current EOS lenses, too.

I like to use my Nikon D700/24-70mm and some prime lenses as well as a medium format camera (film + scans) - so it is not easy to live with the smaller formats.  After looking at consumer DSLRs like the Nikon d5000, I would still be stuck with a too-large camera for all-day carrying around.The GF-1 with the micro 4/3s format just met my criteria and it hasn't disappointed me.  It is smaller but has a lot of features that permit manual control when needed.  The 20mm lens is really nice: small and sharp.  I have spent a week playing with it, using it and messing around with Silkypix RAW converter software.  I use 64 bit Windows so I had to spring for version 4 which cost me $149.  In addition, like all cameras using LCDs, the GF-1 was not very useful in bright sunlight so I had to spring for the accessory viewfinder - another $159 (Amazon).  All in all it added up to a bit of change, but I am not reqretting it.  I am excited to be able to carry a camera around.  Frankly, the D700, even with a small prime is just too big to lug around on long trips.  Theft is also a concern.As to the RAW converter, Silkypix, it seems to work well but takes a bit of work to figure it out.  I has a number of controls.  If I used Photoshop with its Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) converter, then things might be easier.  For now I still use Nikon's NX2 software for editing, which I feel very confortable using so I'll stick with Silkypix and TIFF files from that software.All in all, I recommend this camera.

The image quality is very good, and although I hear it's good on full auto, I use mine on full manual or shutter priority, and it's very easy to use if you've had any experience with a full featured camera. The buttons and menus are very intuitive, the wheel at the top of the camera is easy to use and I like the flash to use as a fill flash.  At default I got a few blown highlights, but this is very easy to control by stepping down just a little.The only things that I didn't love are the rear dial - it's a little more recessed than I'd like, although I got used to it pretty quickly - and I would have preferred a flip and twist screen since the camera doesn't come with a view finder.  Otherwise I'm very satisfied with this camera.The 14-45mm kit lens is good quality.  It's solid with no rattles, turns with just enough resistance, and takes sharp high quality pics with very little chromatic aberration.One thing last worth mentioning is the stabilization.  It's in the lens, and it works better than I expected.  I got handheld pics reliably at speeds I haven't been able to shoot at before.  That being said, if you prefer your stabilization in the camera rather than in the lens, the E-PL1 is definitely worth checking out.I'm very happy with the GF1, particularly the easy menus and controls.  It takes the annoyances out of photography so I can concentrate on taking the pics rather than fighting the camera.

I have owned several Nikons consumer point and shoots including the S-10 and P-90. I was disappointed that the camera was making all the decisions and that the long zoom lenses take forever to focus, if they focus at all.  I wanted to move up into something more like a pro or prosumer camera without spending more than $1,000.The local professional camera shop recommended the GF1 as a great step up camera. They were right! The GF1 is light, portable and is feature rich. It can be used as a point and shoot in iA (intelligent auto)  mode, or you can take control in much the same way pros use their SLRs.This camera is fast - noticeably faster that any other consumer camera I've owned. Gone are the days of missing a shot because the camera needs to recover.Interchangeable lens - Much like an SLR, this camera allows you to choose your lenses. I selected the 14-45 lens because I wanted the ability to zoom and have image stability. The GF1 relies on the lens to provide image stability. This is denoted by the OIS label on the side of the Panasonic Lens.  Not all lens will offer image stability. As the Micro 4:3's format becomes more widely adopted, I expect the choices of lenses to increase.Size - My friend the professional photographer likes to say that the best camera is the one you use. The GF1 makes using it easy. The body itself is small, about the size of a medium point & shoot. With the 20mm lens, the camera will easy fit in a jacket pocket.Capability - This is where the GF1 shines. It is by far the most capable camera this size. It easily competes with entry level SLRs. I'm not going to list all the features and settings here. You should do some homework to determine if this camera has the feature set for you.  My research gave me confidence that this is a camera that I could grow into, but still get great photos right out of the box.Battery Life - I have found the battery life to be excellent. I take between one and two hundred photos per day when traveling. I have never had the battery die on me mid day. I have been able to get by with only one battery and by charging nightly.Video - I really like the video on this camera. However, there are some things to note: it is only available in 720, not 1080. The sound is mono, not stereo. It has no source of onboard light for low light situations. Unlit subjects will result in dark movies. However, given the choice of using a top of the line camera with some video capabilities vs. carrying both a video and still camera, I would take the GF1 with no reservations. I haven't gotten too deep into video editing, so you I can't advise on the finer points this topic using content from the GF1. I have seen that there are not may video editing packages that are set up for the AVCHD-Lite  format that this camera records in.  I use VideoPad Video Editor from NCH software:[...]Manual - The manual is terrible. It forces you to cross reference and bounce back an forth between sections to answer questions. It reads like they used software to translate it from Japanese. Not helpful. As an aside, David Busch's Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 guide book is excellent. I highly recommend it.What's not in the box - There are several items that you might want to add to maximize your GF1 experience. If you are shooting outside or in other bright light environments, I recommend the live view finder. It is an external electronic view finder that plugs into the hot shoe dock on the top of the camera.  Otherwise, you are limited to the LCD on the back of the camera. A camera strap - the stock strap is garbage and has a steal me sign on it - the camera's model number. A lens cap keeper - the stock lens cap does not attach to the camera body. Eventually you will lose it. A good case for your camera rounds out my recommendations.Photos - the photo quality is excellent. I have gotten great photos out of this camera. One nice feature that that when you review your photos on the camera, it will tell you what settings were used to take the picture. If you do get a bad photo (in my case user error by using manual settings), you can review what settings were used and then make adjustments. It will shoot in RAW, JPEG, or both depending on how you set up the camera.Camera body - The GF1 has a metal body. A previous reviewer indicated it was plastic.  I have found it to be very durable.Traveling: This is a camera that does not require a full bag of gear to get good photos. Most trips, I take one lens - the 14-45. I can get 95% of what I want with this set up. Very rarely do I feel like I need more lens.Summary:This is a quality camera that can be enjoyed by novices and by those looking to step up from point and shoots. It is more capable and faster than long zoom consumer cameras. It has pro and pro-lite features that will push hobbyists. This camera was definitely the right choice for me.

I purchased the viewfinder to use with nature photography and also recommend it for use with the telephoto to follow animal movement and such. I love the information provided in the frame.It has many features and will take some time to learn but is recommended for anyone but mostly for more advanced photographers.I had an olympus pen F in my 20s when traveling the world and in college and this one give me the same convenience and portability that i have desired since the advent of digital cameras. The IA and the Vivid features are particularly useful, and I also enjoy the ability to multiply the focal distance.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Answer to the problem", "Author": "Fauxtron", "ReviewID": "R4KR74A98KTCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great camera.

I was always disappointed with on what was a high end P&S; at the time of purchase: Outside shots were good, but inside were so-so, low light was bad, and flash was abysmal.  I considered purchasing a DSLR, but I wanted a camera I would actually take out, and the DSLRs seemed too big.At first a lot of my shots with this camera were very mixed: There were a lot of good ones, but the low light was bad, flash was terrible, and I got a lot of shaky pictures even during the day.  I didn't see much benefit from my P&S.;My problem was I was trying to be Mr. Professional Camera man right away.  If you just put it on the \"Intellegent Auto\" mode you'll get some pretty impressive shots.  Once I did that a lot of my problems went away.I also figured out that when you're playing with shutter speed and aperture that this camera has an exposure assist.  This was really helpful once I felt comfortable moving away from iA.  I felt pretty \"pro\" fiddling with things and having it come out nice like, even though I didn't know what I was doing at first.  Now I've got a sense of what the combinations of ISO/SS/F will affect the picture.  It's like the camera taught me.I really like the pre-whatchamacallit focus scene mode.  This helps with getting those narrow depth of field shots, which I'm surprised I can pull off with the lens this came with.I still don't care much for flash shots.  I've played with the settings and have gotten better results.  Part of me thinks I just hate flash.Also, I've seen this critique before, but the lack of a view finder makes outdoor shots in bright light a pain.And one tip: Get a higher class SD card.  I took the old 1GB card from my P&S; and there was sometimes some big waiting between shots.  When my class 10 card came in, it was significantly reduced.  In the manual it recommends at least a class 6.I've only had this camera for a little while, but I've taken a lot of shots, and I'm extremely happy with it.  I've taken some beautiful shots of my wife, my dog and my cat, as well as friends and flowers.  I feel like they look like they came from a magazine.EDIT: Still happy after a month.

The GF1 is an excellent entry point into the kit camera range.  There are plenty of ways to control a photo ... manual shutter, aperture, focus and ISO settings, along with a healthy variety of filters. Plus plenty of auto settings. With its large sensor (compared to any compact), photos without a flash are amazing in light conditions which used to be hopeless for me. Indoor photos without flash seem to come out brighter than what I see with my eyes. Right after I received this camera a couple weeks ago, I field-tested it on a business trip to Tampa and was very pleased. I've uploaded a few of those \"customer images\" to Amazon that were taken in several challenging lighting conditions. Judge for yourself.I've only shot 2 video clips so far but don't really have an opinion about quality yet, although it's pretty easy to use.Build quality is first class. Rock solid with controls and fittings that feel like they should last forever.I bought the kit with the 14-45mm lens which has a very smooth zoom but seems especially large on its body. I tested the lens with its Optical Image Stabilization switched off, and it does make a noticeable difference.  Sometime this year, I'm going to get the 20mm pancake lens that the critics are raving about. Hopefully by then, I'll have mastered how to choose the setting or combo for each effect I want. I'm really looking forward to learning how to take much better photos, and I now know for sure that this camera will teach me.The most negative thing that I can say about the GF1 is its price. Fortunately, I managed to get it for \"only\" $849 from a very reliable retailer on Amazon the day after Christmas.  That deal seems to be long gone.

But I think few have subjected their camera to as much abuse as I have recently, so I'll offer my experience here.I bought the Panasonic GF-1 with the 14-45 mm lens and used it on a two week family trip to Europe recently.  Well, it came days before the trip and in the midst of chaos I left the camera strap at home and just stuffed the camera in a small, sagging camera bag.  On day two, while on the road, the camera flew out of the opened bag, and landed on hard pavement after tumbling a few feet.  A small section of the edge of the LCD screen was dented.  I was surprised there were no additional physical damage.  And this was just the beginning of the trip.  In all, the camera got dropped, in the bag, a few more times (due to the lack of a strap) during the trip.After all that, the camera performed as well as new.  Pictures came out very well.  No rattles or loose parts.  Lens mount seems to be very solid still.This could not be said about my Sony point and shoot (W290), which probably saw less abuse.

The SLR is quicker on the fire and reload factors, but the Panny is good enough.  And did I mention it is much smaller than the 30D?  It's not going in your pocket, but it won't stretch your neck over the course of a day either.I tried the Canon S90, and G11 as alternatives, but found them to be too slow on the fire/reload in comparison to the GF1.  All three take excellent pix, but in large format the GF1 leaves them behind.  Also the manual focus function of the GF1 is far superior to that in the Canons.  I found the manual focus very crude and nearly undecipherable on the Canons.

Mason", "ReviewID": "R2Y02AOHTA4SUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already own two digital cameras ... a Canon D40 DSLR and a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 DSLR-Like camera.  Both of these cameras have their good and bad points.  Despite being very rugged, my D40, paired with an 18-250mm lens and using a neoprene strap, is bulky and heavy.  After carrying it around all day, my neck gets stiff as a board.  My Lumix FZ28 is lightweight and the superzoom is awesome.  On the other hand, I've missed so many action shots while waiting for my FZ28's mechanical zoom to position itself.  Being able to \"twist to zoom\" my D40 is so much faster.I really wanted the best of both worlds ... a lightweight camera that had the manual zoom responsiveness of a DSLR.  When I read about the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1, it seemed perfect.  The micro four thirds system makes the GF1's body light and compact; while the interchangeable lens give me the manual zooming capability of a DSLR.  So I now own 3 digital cameras!I just bought the GF1 with the 14-45mm kit lens.  I also got the optional viewfinder (EVF) and a separate 45-200mm lens.  Other than the price, which was outrageous, I'm reasonably happy with my purchase.For a casual day out, the GF1, paired with its 14-45mm lens, is small enough to fit in my purse or a large coat pocket.  And, when I want more zoom power, I can switch to the 45-200mm lens.  At the camera's full 12.1 mexapixel resolution, each photo is 5-7mb; so I can do some pretty extensive cropping and still have great looking shots.Below are some of my first impressions ... pro and con ... about the GF1.1.  Image quality:  In good light the GF1's image quality is outstanding.For outdoor scenery shots, the GF1 images (shot in full auto mode) had excellent depth of field, keeping much of the foreground and background in sharp focus.I also shot a couple of portraits using the GF1's full auto mode, with the flash on.  There also came out extremely good.  It might have something to do with the GF1's face detection ability; but the facial highlights were beautiful, the skin tones were accurate, and the sharpness was just right ... not to soft and not to harsh.For comparison, I also shot the same scenery and portraits with both of my other two cameras.  The GF1's images were the best out of the bunch.Low-light shooting (full auto mode, inside with just the house lights on) was a different matter.  In this situation, the GF1's image quality was fair to poor.  I've read some reviews that claim the GF1 performs excellent in low light; but that certainly wasn't my experience.  My test photos came out slightly blurred, under exposed and off-colored.  Many museums and galleries don't allow flash photography; so I'm rather disappointed in the GF1's low-light, non-flash image quality.  I may be able play around with the camera settings (e.g. ISO, White Balance, etc.) in order to improve the quality.I haven't really played with the video mode much; but so far, it appears to be pretty decent in good lighting, and only so-so in low light.2.  Camera Build:  The GF1's size is wonderful; but being tactful, the moving parts (flash, battery compartment door) feel a bit too delicate.  The owner's manual clearly states that the camera is not weather sealed and advises owners to avoid using it in dusty/sandy areas or in the rain.  Hummm?  In fairness to Panasonic, their goal was to build a small, lightweight camera that rivals the heavy DSLR's already on the market; so in order to accomplish that goal, a whole lot of plastic had to be used.a. Lens Mount - The lens and lens mount both have metal rings and contact points; but changing lenses requires careful attention so as not to strip/cross-thread them.  Even when properly aligned, the lens doesn't turn as smoothly as it should when being mounted on the camera.  I cringe as I'm mounting a lens, and then, when I finally hear it click into place, I breathe a sigh of relief.b. Menus & Controls - Overall, I like the GF1's menus and control.  They are fairly similar to my other Panasonic camera; so I didn't have too much of a learning curve.  One thing I especially like is the ability to set the function button to whatever menu option I want.  For example, I frequently change between displaying and not displaying a grid on the LCD screen.  I set the function button to access the grid menu settings; so now I can quickly change back and forth without going through the full menu system.One poorly designed feature is the drive mode lever, used for changing between single shot, burst mode, bracketed exposure, and self timer.  Having a lever to change between these drive modes is much more convenient than what I have to go through on my D40.  On the other hand, the lever is located directly in front of the camera's mode dial, making it difficult to change the camera mode without accidentally hitting it.  While changing modes, I inadvertently bumped the drive mode lever, moving it to the self timer position.  When I then tried to take a picture, there was about a 10 second delaying after I'd fully pressed the shutter button.  After a bit of head scratching and frustration, I finally figured out what I'd done.c. Flash - Most cameras have the built-in flash in the center; but the GF1's flash is located on the left side (when shooting) of the camera.  This location makes it a bit awkward to hold the camera and open the flash.  Also, if you use the auto flash and/or red-eye reduction settings, your hand can get in the way and interfere with the flash opening properly.When the flash opens, it pops up and then moves forward a bit.  When closing the flash, you have to push the flash head back before pushing it down.  If you were to push straight down, as you do on most other cameras, you might break the flash's hinges, which are very fragile.3.  Lens Build:  The lens' optical quality is excellent and the size/weight is considerably less than comparable DSLR lenses.  Aside from the mounting issue, mentioned above, the lens has a nice feel to it.  The zoom and manual focus rings have just the right amount of resistance ... not too tight and not to loose.  Also, the auto focus response is fairly fast.4.  Battery & Charger:  The battery life is average to good for this type of camera.  For all of my other camera equipment, I've purchased a spare 3rd party battery and never had any problems with them.  It's important to note that Panasonic has started encoded their batteries (supposedly for safety; but I'm sure it helps their sales too) to prevent the use of 3rd party batteries that don't meet their rigid safety standards.  As present their website says there are no 3rd party batteries that currently meet their standards.  The bottom line ... plan on spending twice as much for an OEM battery if you want a spare one.Also, my other battery chargers have a flip out plug; but this one has a detachable power cord.  The cord is just one more thing to have to pack when traveling; but the charger works just fine.5.  Viewfinder/LCD Screen:  The GF1 comes with an LCD screen; but it doesn't have a built-in eyepiece/viewfinder.  This was done in order to reduce the camera's size.For those of us who like using a viewfinder (especially in bright sunlight), Panasonic sells an optional Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) that connects to the camera's hot shoe.  The optional EVF has a diaptor dial and a button that switches between it and the LCD screen.  It also tilts 90 degrees for shooting high/low subjects without breaking your neck.There are a few issues worth mentioning about the EVF.First, since it uses the hot shoe, you can't use the EVF and an external flash at the same time.Next, when I slid my EVF onto the hot shoe, it slid on very tightly.  As a matter of fact, the fit is so tight that I'm afraid to remove the EVF for fear of possibly breaking it or the camera's hot shoe.  I'm not happy about this; but since I want a eyepiece/viewfinder and I don't use an external flash, I can live with the EVF being permanently attached to the camera body.Last of all, on most cameras, the image quality is sharper through the viewfinder than what you see on the LCD screen.  You can also see through the viewfinder even when the camera is turned off.  The GF1's EVF simply transfers the LCD image display from the screen to the eyepiece, with the same LCD quality.  It also requires that the camera to be turned on in order for it to work.Overall:I want to give this camera a high rating because (1) The GF1's features truly rival those found on larger digital SLR's, (2) It take great pictures in good lighting or with the flash, and (3) It's so lightweight and small.  On the other hand, the GF1 has too many little nuances and it's way overpriced.  (In addition to paying for the actual camera, we're still paying for the research that went into the Panasonic/Olympus development of the four thirds and micro four thirds technology.)Under the circumstances, I'm being a bit generous to give the GF1 a 4 star rating.  If I could, I would drop my rating to 3.5 - 3.75 stars.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Stephen G.
