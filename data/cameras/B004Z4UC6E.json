{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some Pretty Beast Earphones", "Author": "The Fam", "ReviewID": "R2ZK3VE62XZBWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but at a local store, and to tell the truth they surpassed what I expected of them. Granted that I didn't expect much, they really do have some good bass in them. The sound quality is very clear and the bass, although not as rich and deep as some of the others ear-phones I have owned, have a brilliant range. They are extremely good headphones for the price, and if your like me, the colors make all the difference, I mean come on, who want a boring black pair of headphones when you can get these babies?", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004Z4UC6E"}}
