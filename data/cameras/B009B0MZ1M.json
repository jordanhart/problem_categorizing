{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For what I bought it for, Its amazing.", "Author": "Nathan Hobbs", "ReviewID": "R2V4M9SB9AXF9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up on the SX50 to do wildlife identification with birds and other critters. I have spent many hours behind the lens of Canons EOS cameras including the Mark III and 5d2 with L grade telephoto glass but I needed something lightweight and compact to use when the weight of the DSLR system was not desirable.This camera is amazing for that task. I had looked at the SX30 and the SX40 in the past but for me testing them out at the stores the Autofocus just was not yet fast enough for me to be willing to work with. The SX50 changes that and has a very quick AF system that has already worked for me in a variety of situations for a sub 500 dollar point and shoot class camera I am extremely impressed with the AF system.The resolution at 1200mm has exceeded my expectations and can create print worthy sharp results throughout the entire length. To get that kind of focal length with a DSLR would require a serious  budget destroying investment that would weigh a large amount. I highly doubt my 100-400L cropped to the same reach or frame could beat this camera at 1200mm.Ill go over a few of the cameras functions.AF. Very fast for a point and shoot. Not DSLR 7D fast while running L lenses fast but still locks on with ease. The autofocus does have a tendency to lock onto foreground elements when shooting in foilage and I do wish it had a MF ring of some kind or a AF stop button that the DSLRS have. Using MF is frustratingly slow with the back dial.ISO. Blown away at how good the ISO ratings are for this camera. It has been a while since I owned a small point and shoot and I am amazed that I can get usable results at ISO 800. Raw images clean up especially well and respond to noise reduction. Its a good thing the camera can handle higher ISO's well because the slower lens does eat up and demand a lot of light.IS The image stabilizer works remarkably well and easily preforms to the claimed 4.5 stops or more, I have taken several successful shots at 1/100th of a second at 1200mm. Thats simply unprecedented. The IS also does a great job at stabilizing the image while framing. Turn the IS off for a bit and you will quickly realize how hard the IS has to work to make the 1200mm lens on this camera worth using.Zoom. looong. 24-1200mm is insane look at my sample shots of the mine at 24mm and 1200mm to get an idea of the range of this camera.Many of you will complain about the slow f stop at 1200mm but consider that a 35mm SLR lens at 800 5.6 will set you back 10k and a 1200 5.6 is 150k so a useable 1200mm equivalent at F6.5  for 479 is an absolute steal. The fact that this little camera can get a acceptable shot at 1200mm opens up a realm of possibilities that was previously simply economically impossible for many. It also zooms along the range very quickly, the framing assist button along the cameras side is a handy feature and backs the lens in and out fast allowing you to recompose.What do I dislike so far?The EVF viewfinder is garbage, there is not enough relief between the body and the EVF for it to be very useful for me and it does not have enough dots to make out what you are photographing,the EVF screen is washed out especially on bright sunlit days. I have opted for the swivel LCD exclusively and would not have missed it had they omitted the finder altogether thankfully the LCD is plenty bright so it can always be useful but a better evf would be handy to hold the camera in close.Front dial. Canon why cant you give the top of the line powershot a front rotating dial? That dial would make adjusting things on the fly tremendously easier. The body is a bit small and the back dial is low that using it while keeping a secure grip is a bit difficult for me as well I would of prefered it to be higher on the camera personally.Flash does not pop up automatically. The flash button on the side of the camera does nothing unless you have physically raised the flash yourself. This is not a deal breaker for me because I will likely use the flash rarely if everl, I have better cameras that cover the range of the tiny flash, but for the average point and shooter whom will purchase this as an only camera this could ruin a lot of photos.No front threaded filter mount. The only way to attach a filter is via the bayonet adapter. I would of preferred a screw on attachment for a permanent UV filter to protect the lens.All in all I am quite pleased with the camera its an enjoyable system and I have already gotten many great shots with it. The super telephoto lens has a bit of a learning curve but as soon as you get the hang of it and understand the IS systems limitations you will be on your way to getting many great photos with this little guy.The Minimum focus distance has a few awkward spots at around 700mm it jumps up to 6.5 ft but drops down to 4.2 ft at 1200mm this may make a few macro insect shots hard to do without externally attached filters.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is a pig laying eggs, giving wool and milk. Great.", "Author": "SelbstGetestet \"SelbstGetestet\"", "ReviewID": "R3KJLP32C865MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all: Please apologize my language, I'm no native speaker, but received so much help from Amazon.com reviews over the years, that I now try to give back my modest bit and tell about my experience with the Canon SX50 HS.Before I used to walk around with two cams standby:1st the Samsumg WB500, because I'm living at the shoreline where we need horizontal space for our pictures, hence can make best use of the 24mm ultra-wide lens.2nd the Olympus SP-800UZ, because in a harbor area  there are lots of fences and off limits zones, where they won't let you in, but you just want, want and want to take your pics nonetheless, hence depend on zoom potential.Additionally there are seabirds and seal, a shy sheep's eye, a distant cow's tongue, whatever - I just never left the house without the 30x zoom of my Olympus.Some weeks ago however, I noticed that besides taking pictures I'd love to now and then take videos, too.And this is, where the Canon SX50 HS cought my attention, because:My Olympus can take decent movies, but either you want it to zoom, so you need to go without sound. Or you want sound, so it won't zoom. No comment. :-(My Samsung can take decent movies, even with zoom and sound, but once you touch the zoom, it will produce this pesky grinding noise, which spoils whatever atmosphere.So I googled my bit and my nostrils got wide when I cought whiff of Canon SX50 HS's fragrance.A bridge camera with 24mm ultra-wide lens, x50 instead of my beloved x30 zoom?OK, here is, what I can tell about after 12 days of testing:I tested it for 3 days with 3 cameras around my neck. Every video I shot, every picture I took, were shot thrice.Meantime (day 11) I only leave the house with one camera with me, with Canon SX50 HS).Beginning with the results of what my other cams did satisfyingly good anyway:The 24mm ultra-wide lens is at least as good as is the Samsung WB500 one. No awkward distortion. You can approach the ship or whaterver else  horizontal you wish to take your pic of, and will be satisfied with the result.Canon SX50 vs Olympus SP-800UZ: Of course the zoom range 30:50 stands for itself.The magnificent difference in addition however is the Canon's stabilisation potential.No matter if picture or video, where an Olympus' shot depends on absolutely steady hand, your Canon will be tolerant and kind of swing it out gracefully.I compiled some videos Canon vs Olympus on youtube, to show the difference, you can find me on \"amSeehafen\", if you like to watch.I also put there lots of videos, which to even try wouldn't have made any sense with both the other cams.1st: Neither Samsung WB500 nor Olympus SP-800UZ are any good after sun down.Still, such a harbor area has it's temptations at nighttime as well.So one of my first Canon tests was, to see, how it would handle darkness.You can see some results at youtube amSeehafen, too. It paints black black and light light. Quite crisp and perfect. Wow.My next reason to love the Canon is, that it is way more tolerant re movements, shaking of hand, etc.Of course it shakes like hell, if your hand is directly being twisted by coastal winds.Who wouldn't.Yet if it's just halfway still, you can zoom the full ammount (including digital) zoom without tripod, and earn undreamt of crisp and calm results.The sound, however, at first shocked me. Knattering, rattling, loud. (!?)Until I found out, that the culprit was our constant coastal wind. So I reduced noise sensitivity down to close deafness, and voila: This lovely camera's sound is pretty perfect. It can even handle wind and make it sound like wind. Which - you'll agree, if you're anyway experienced - is quite a piece of artistry!(Addition - written 1 month after: On the long hand the deafened microfones are not satisfying, because they muzzle too many desired environment sounds, too. But some investigation on youtube gave me the idea, which helped to solve the problem: Just attach a piece of fur via doublesided sticky tape round the microfone holes. Make sure not to block the openings. I admit, it gives your cam quite a funny look, but hey - you'll love the sound! Find my tutorial and sound examples on youtube AmSeehafen.Well, what else to tell - I tested the macro mode with both flowers and spiders - you can find shares on youtube amSeehafen as well, it's doing good job.I found the slow motion mode, which nobody needs, but is lots of fun. I never knew how long our cat's tongues can gear out, until I could watch them slurping their treats in slow motion...The only shortfall I noticed up to now is, the lense is helluva sensitive to pollution. So you best *always* carry a handkerchief or something with you, to clean lense as soon as necessary.None of my other cams ever was nearly as 'sissy, as is the SX50 HS in this regard.But the display is fantastic. Even I with my elderly weak eyes can notice pretty quick, once the pictures or movies blurr.Talking of the display: I also love that it can be moved. I'm not so tall, and fences can be oh so high... No prob to me anymore.If I keep the Canon SX50 HS.Which I intend to do.And herewith recommend it to everybody who has about the same ideas of what to ask from their camera.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the monster-zoom, it works very well.

For what it does best, it works very well. For the rest, well... that depends.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&This is a video I shot of a fishing boat in Monterey Bay.  I used my new SX50 with a 50X optical zoom and a 4X digital zoom for a total of 200X (sort of.)  I know it's pixillated, but still just look carefully and you can see the fisherman casting his fishing pole at the stern of the boat and then sitting down.  Pretty amazing video technology they have developed for this camera. So that is where this review starts - with the monster-zoom telephoto lens.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&What this camera does best is pretty obvious - it has a monster-zoom telephoto lens.  I enjoy doing some telephoto work, and for that purpose it works amazingly well.  At a 1200mm - 50X - zoom you simply cannot buy a Canon DSLR lens with that kind of magnification for any amount of money.*1  The largest [standard production] DSLR telephoto lens that Canon makes is an 800mm and that lens costs over $13,000.  So there you have it.  For around $500 you can run circles around that magnification, get some fantastic shots and have a lot of fun with it. It will most definitely amaze your friends when you show them with what you can do with the monster-zoom feature alone.*1  Technically, \"any amount of money\" is not completely true here. Another poster has pointed out that on special order Canon will make a 1200MM lens for a DSLR. It weighs about 40 lbs. The MSRP is $100,000. Only a few dozen have ever been produced.  My bad.It also has a wide ISO range (film speed) combined with some very fast shutter speeds for fast-action shots.  And the recovery and repeat shot time is very fast too. There is also built-in HDR (High Dynamic Range) feature that will be fun to use for creating vibrant-colored, surreal landscapes. (Don't try it with portraits though, since HDR is notoriously bad at distorting human skin tones.)  For the more advanced shooters it also offer RAW files as well as RAW plus JPEG, so that you can fine-tune your photos with post-processing in a Photoshop-type program.All around this should turn out to be a good recreational and family-fun camera that will work very well for daytime things like social events and sporting events, particularly at getting candid shots of people all the way across the other side of the auditorium or the sports arena. And it has an excellent HD video feature that - with a good secure tripod - can produce some very respectable quality videos. Unfortunately, the \"hot shoe\" for the camera only works with an external flash, not a high-quality external microphone.  So no, it won't take one, so you don't even need to ask. Yes, of course with a high quality HD video feature you would only expect that Canon would allow you to attach a high-quality external microphone to the hot shoe, but no they don't. You can take that up with Canon - again - just the way people did last year, and see how far you get with it. Otherwise you will simply have to enjoy it  the way it is, or else use a tape recorder and sync the sound with it in a movie-making program afterwards.But if you want to take any long-exposure, nighttime shots with it, then this camera probably will not work for you at all.  It COULD take them easily, but for marketing reasons Canon put an arbitrary ISO limit on it last year that will no longer let it take them. (Earlier models of this same camera could easily take them before Canon imposed the arbitrary ISO limit on it.)If you have ever owned any of the previous cameras of this series, (the SX1, SX10, SX20 and SX30,) then you probably know that it has a rather small 1/2.3 sized sensor, but (now) it processes the images with a very good DIGIC 5 processor.  If you have also owned an SX40, then you also may be aware of a rather recent limitation on this line of cameras that the previous models did not have.  Beginning with the model SX40 Canon put an arbitrary ISO (film speed) limit on the camera which severely restricts one type of photography in particular - long-exposure, low-light, nighttime photographs. They are now almost impossible to take with this line of camera, because the user can no longer select any ISO greater than 100 at any of the slower shutter speeds, not even in full manual mode.ISO 100 is a film speed (nowadays called \"sensor sensitivity\", but the numbers are identical) that has been traditionally used only in bright daytime photo shooting. Low light and nighttime exposures have always required faster film speeds like ISO 400, ISO 800, ISO 1000 or even more.  Photos of that type which had always been easy to take with earlier models of this camera suddenly became almost impossible to take beginning with the SX40. Suddenly any attempt to set the shutter speed to slower than 1.3 seconds automatically reduced the camera setting to ISO 100. There was no way for the user to bypass this limit, (without resorting to a special Hacker program available on the internet called \"CHDK.\" Watch a YouTube video on that before you decide to try it. )There were a lot of complaints about the ISO limit on the SX40 from a lot of users (me included - see the YouTube video on \"Canon SX40 ISO limits,\") going on for a year now, and finally Canon has introduced the new model SX50.  So here's the bad news... Canon did not take the ISO limit off this line of cameras.  In fact, the ISO limit on the new SX50 is even worse. Now any attempt to drop the shutter speed under 1 second automatically drops the ISO setting to ISO 80. The user cannot change this limit, even in full manual mode.Adding to that problem, the SX50 has also reduced the widest aperture opening from f/2.7 to f/3.4.  The aperture is the size of the opening that allows light to enter the camera through the lens. It is variable, and the smaller the number the larger the opening. So on the new SX50 the largest size to which you can open up the aperture to let light in has been reduced from f/2.7 to f/3.4. The result is that now it is even harder to take low-light, long-exposure, nighttime photographs with it.  The current Canon SX160 with the same-sized sensor (though a CCD and not a CMOS sensor) does NOT have this arbitrary limit on it, and does very well at taking long-exposure, nighttime photographs, so I bought it too - for less than half the price of the SX50 - and I gave that one a very strong 5-star rating.  Since my primary use of my cameras, however, is expressly for taking long-exposure nighttime photographs, and since there is NO TECHNICAL REASON for putting this arbitrary ISO limit on the SX50 camera (it has already been established during the previous year that it was a marketing decision) - then I'm giving this camera a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating.  Not for what it CAN'T do, but simply for what Canon will no longer LET it do.If you want to use the camera for a similar purpose - nighttime long exposures, moonlit night scenes, deer in the garden at night, wide-angle star shots or anything similar to those themes, then this camera will not work well for you at all. I understand that the audience for that usage may well be only a small percentage of all users.  Still, some users will be effected by it and they need to know.  During the last year quite of few of them were pretty upset by that ISO 100 limit on the SX40, so those same users will probably like the the more restrictive ISO 80 limit on the new SX50 even less.  In case there is any doubt about it, the online .pdf file for the User Manual at Canon's website clearly states on pages 150 and 152 - \"With shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or slower, ISO speed is [symbol \"ISO80\"] and cannot be changed.\"If that effects you, then now you know about it.  If it doesn't effect you, then you can simply ignore this part of the review and then you may well have a lot of fun with this camera. With it's many other features I'm sure it will be a lot of fun, and that is one of the reasons I am keeping it myself - for those other features.  But for $500 for a digital camera you should at least know very clearly what you will be getting for your money, ... and what you will not.Best wishes either way you decide,  John", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, some pitfalls", "Author": "Alin S.

But it has some PITFALLS that are making me return it in favor of a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200This things main point is ZOOM... PERIOD. A monster 1200mm (50X) lens is on this baby and the optics are impeccable. Add in the DIGIC 5 processor and digital zoom and you have 200X of usable zoom. an image taken at 200X is quite usable.Manual mode on this camera is plain FUN. You even get control over the power of the flash, something I have never seen in another camera.Is this thing a performer in low light, i have reservations. Testing it against my Sony DSC-HX100V the HX100V beats the hell out of this camera because it does not limit its ISO to 80 in shutter speeds longer than 1 second. This is an arbitrary limit, it has nothing to do with what the camera CAN technically do its what canon wants you doing with their equipment.The camera has incredibly bad video encoding which results in you toting 4GB for 30 minutes of 720p HD video where in my Sony DSC-HX100V I can record easily double that, thanks to it using AVCHD codecs. This camera like the Sony has the dumb 30 minute video limit because of European Union tax on 'camcorders' so to avoid that tax they limit it's video recording.Can these limitations be avoided, yes they can by using a firmware hack kit called CHDK (Google it and get to know it, it's not supported on the SX50 yet an alpha release is in testing)So is this camera perfect, no. Is this camera probably the best you can get it's price range, more than likely a yes. (Mind you that 50x lens alone on a DSLR will cost you $100k) I got 400k dollars in lenses for 400 dollars.Knocking a star off for the arbitrary limitations on here, Canon you know that there is no camcorder tax in the united states. Give us a USA firmware. and another star for the noisy zoom and clicky lens stabilization and poor auto focus.So do I recommend buying this camera..If you are after LOTS of zoom and don't really care about attaching filters to your camera and extending the optical abilities, don't need to record lots of video, don't care if your AF lamp can light a whole room and dont care that much about battery life. fineBut in retrospect the Panasonic FZ200 has a whopping 540 shots per battery.3 batteries = 1540 shots.this thing3 batteries = 1000 shots or so.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Superzoom on the Market, Ideal for Birding, Significant Improvement over SX40", "Author": "FFDR", "ReviewID": "R16Z83QHEMJMI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I are birders and are always on the look for a camera with great zooming ability that is still sufficiently light to carry. We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth.

I've been in the digital revolution for about 15 years, and have been searching for \"the perfect camera\".  Had to send an Olympus OME back, along with the \"super zoom\" -- just didn't make the quality photos I was searching for.  We've had very good results with our little \"pocket\" Canon cameras, and decided to try the SX50.  Took about 15 minutes to sort out the operations, and when we reviewed our first 200 test shots my wife exclaimed:\"we've found the camera!\".  We'll be ordering a second one soon, so we each have one of these remarkable devices.THE GOOD STUFF:  easy to use.  image stabilizer is incredible.  Quality of wide angle shots superb.  Zoom this thing out to the 1100 mm and get INCREDIBLE photos of flowers and critters.  FAST operation -- turn it on and shoot; push the shutter release and it doesn't have to think about it like most digitals seem to -- it clicks immediately. Nice for shooting picts of birds who spend 3 seconds on a perch and then are gone, or a bee that touches a flower then moves on, or a squirrel who doesn't know he's supposed to pose for a photo.  Has superb battery life -- we've gotten over 200 shots and the battery indicator shows still \"full\" (don't know how long it will last, I recharge the lithiums after every shooting session).  Be sure and get a large capacity card -- you'll take LOTS of photos with this thing.  Closeups with the 24 mm setting are good, but I find myself using that long tele to get closeups because it has a better depth of field. The quality of the photos taken by this camera that costs (lens and all) $500 is just unbelievable.  Canon has outdone itself.THE AGGRAVATIONS:  auto focus, especially at long zoom, is -- like all auto focus cameras I've used -- aggravating.  When the autofocus is on track, it is superb.  But it sometimes just refuses to focus, no matter how many times I center the focus area on my subject.  IF it had manual focus, like my Panasonic does, it would be a DREAM camera. (It supposedly DOES have manual focus, but I haven't been able to persuade it to work, probably because the manual focus is tedious to use(as compared to my Panasonic DMC-FV50.)It is not silent -- it clatters when focusing, but not a big deal.  A little heavy, but this is in my mind actually a plus -- implies well made (not as heavy as our old Nikon with long lens, but heavier than the pocket cameras.Keep in mind this is not a $10,000 camera and lens -- you can see the hairs on the flowers, the fine detail on a bird's head, but they are NOT as crisp as my old glass lenses.  But considering how good the image actually is on most of my shots, I think you're still getting a LOT more in relative value than you are paying for with this camera!", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Massive 50X Optical Zoom is a No-brainer", "Author": "Paul W.", "ReviewID": "R87AQP1PTWDQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are those who questioned whether the 50X optical zoom in this camera is useable in view of the smaller aperture (f/3.4 - f/6.5) with some recommending a camera with a smaller zoom power and larger aperture over one with a longer zoom and smaller aperture. This may sound persuasive, but when it comes to the awesome 50X optical zoom found in the Canon Powershot SX50 HS, the pros of having a longer zoom certainly outweigh the cons of a smaller aperture.  Anyway the aperture is really not that much smaller than the previous powershot model SX40 (f/2.7 - f/5.8).  Now the full-range f/2.8 aperture of the new Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ200 24X zoom camera seems groundbreaking in comparison, but if you read its reviews, you will discover that there is a price to pay in higher picture noise levels, as the performance of Panasonic's LSI Venus processor still lags significantly behind Canon's excellent Digic 5 processor when light levels go down and ISO goes up. Furthermore, the FZ200's optical zoom range of 24X is also less than half that of the SX50 HS.I've used the SX50 HS extensively over 9 days for my vacation in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia recently and can confirm that other than for low-light photography, the maximum 1,200mm telephoto setting is still very useable - handheld, without using a tripod or any kind of support, all thanks to Canon's anti-shake image stabilization system, since I don't have the steady hands of a surgeon. Anyway, if you are into low-light photography, it's much better to invest in a more expensive digital SLR or use a compact camera with a wider aperture such as the new Sony RX100 (f/1.8) for your low-light shots.  This is not to say that the SX50 HS can't be used for night photography - just that you will need a tripod or some kind of support to steady your shots, if you won't be using the built-in flash for illumination at night.It's not always that you can move closer to a subject for the shot, without frightening it away (eg. bird photography) or putting yourself in mortal danger (eg. wildlife photography).  If you're not careful, you can even fall off a cliff while trying to get closer to frame the shot you want. For those times when you just can't physically move any closer to the subject, you will appreciate the awesome zooming power of this camera.  There were times when I even wished that the camera has an optical zoom of 60X or more, and I am truly puzzled by those who suggested that 50X is just too much zoom to handle.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that this camera at maximum zoom really makes it affordable to own a 1,200mm telephoto lens compared to a similar lens on a digital SLR - which will certainly cost an astronomical amount of money.There's no need for me to comment on the excellent color and picture quality this camera is capable of delivering, especially if you turn 'vivid' mode on - just look at the photo samples in the many reviews appearing on photography websites.  Each day more and more reviews appear and continue to affirm that Canon has indeed done its homework to produce a very useable and affordable 50X optical zoom camera for the masses.  Having owned and used a variety of 35mm film-based compact and SLR cameras from brands like Nikon, Pentax, Olympus and then digital cameras from Canon, Olympus, Samsung, Panasonic Lumix and Sony over the last 30 years, I can say that overall, this is the best camera I've ever owned in terms of features, zoom range and value for money.  This is the ideal camera for you if you are upgrading from a 10X-20X travel zoom compact camera, or if you want far greater zooming range than the typical digital SLR or have simply grown tired of lugging around a heavy camera bag laden with interchangeable lenses for your DSLR.In the end, what really matters is whether you can take the shot or not when presented with a photo opportunity that requires extreme telephoto, and if you don't have the versatility of a 50X zoom like this camera, probability of taking the shot is definitely less.  With the Vari-angle LCD on this camera you can practically shoot from the hip, zooming from 24mm wide-angle to 1,200mm extreme telephoto in an instant to capture the moment, when a DSLR user would still be busy changing lenses.

The SX50 focuses faster and the shutter release is faster, both important for capturing birds that seem to flit from branch to branch.  The center focus option is a big improvement and allows one to minimize focusing on branches and leaves. One typically has to wait till winter to shoot bird pictures to avoid the leaves, but this camera extends that season.  I like the fine (F) setting that maximizes the number of pixels.  One can use just a little digital zoom without sacraficing image quality.  I could go to 75X zoom and still get nice images.The camera seems lighter than the SX40.  I walked miles with the camera strap around my neck with no discomfort.  Try that with a DSLR with a big zoom AF VR lens and you will quickly switch to this bridge camera for wildlife pictures.  The DSLRs can't be beat for landscapes and portraits, so don't toss it just yet.I use a 58mm filter adapter so I can use a polarizing filter to take pictures of water birds (ducks, geese, shore birds).  The generic filter adapters have a bayonet type of attachment, not threads.  They work, but not perfectly matched for the Canon cameras (SX20, 30, 40, and 50).  You need to buy a new lens cap to fit the 58mm filters.The high dynamic range (HDR) works very well, especially for indoor lighting.

In that case you may scroll through to the Pros and Cons at the end.First for some background on me for context.  I am an amateur but aspiring to be advanced photographer having been only a snap-happy point and shoot user over the years.  3 years ago I bought the Canon SX120 with the 10x optical zoom specifically for a function at which I was gonna be sitting some distance away from the action.  I was very impressed with the zoom and the photo quality, especially considering this was an indoor function and the lighting was not great.Ever since then I have been hooked on Canon and have been anticipating each generation of new high-end P&S; cameras.  I first fell for the SX30, then the SX40 and finally when the SX50 was announced I knew I HAD to have it.  After researching all alternatives online for months I finally took the plunge and haven't regretted it since.I got the camera just before Christmas 2012 and was tempted to write my first impressions at that time but thought better of it.  So after nearly 4 months and over 3000 photos and videos here goes:Build and layoutThis is a $400 camera but feels like much more.  It has an all-plastic body but there is nothing flimsy about it at all.  Everything feels very solid in my hand.  Those accustomed to using full-size DSLRs will notice it is somewhat lighter and smaller but the overall form factor is identical and allows users to \"play photographer\" just like the big boys (especially if you slapped on an EOS neck-strap like I did, haha).The hand grip is deep enough to allow for a good solid one-handed grip on the camera (I'm 5'11\" with big hands).  With this hold though there is the likelihood of accidentally hitting the menu button or self-timer with the fleshy part of your palm at the right thumb.  It happens infrequently and I have learnt how to hold the camera to prevent that happening, most times.  Annoying, but not a deal-breaker for me.Other cons on the layout: the card and battery compartment are located on the bottom of the camera and are inaccessible while using a tripod.  My guess is that most users of this camera wont find that a big issue since tripod use is almost unnecessary considering the image-stabilization (IS) on this camera. Will get to that later.Personally I would prefer to see the playback and video capture buttons reverse place (as in the SX40) because I find I have to adjust my grip to hit the video button while shooting stills and that can be awkward and sometimes causes me to lose a shot.  Other than that the buttons are well laid out and within reach.Menus and controls are fairly simple and intuitive, especially for previous Canon users.  New users will appreciate the brief descriptive on-screen explanations and tips on each menu option.  Sadly, a few things are inexplicably complex and inaccessible.  (See my comment about hi-speed burst shooting in Performance below).ZoomBelieve the hype.  The zoom on this camera is THAT good.  It reaches so far that you can see details that are completely invisible to the naked eye: - the tail numbers on jets passing overhead;  Who knew that your favorite player had a wrist injury?  This camera picks up his wrist-strap all the way from the bleachers;  You can read the watch on the preacher's hand and signal him to stop already!  Pictures of the moon are detailed and sharp - the craters are clearly visible.  This camera is binoculars, telescope and spy-scope all in one!Admittedly picture quality suffers somewhat at distance but not as much as one might expect.  Truthfully, the issues you see with the camera at full zoom are minimal and frankly 50x pics are simply not available with other lesser tools so a little loss of sharpness is acceptable considering.  I am quite proud of my moon shots and the varied color and detailed plumage of the birds in my neighbor's tree are now clearly visible.  I have great close-up shots of John Legend at his piano from mid-crowd about 100 feet away!Digital zoom is helpful, but image quality degrades rapidly.  It is the nature of digital zoom and not an issue unique to Canon.Canon had the good sense to realize that zooming at those distances frequently means we lose sight of our subject and have included a \"Zoom framing assist\" feature which helps you to toggle quickly between focal lengths to re-acquire your subject.  Brilliant!AccessoriesCanon supplies this camera in a bare-bones package.  You will need to get a memory card (SD, micro-SD with adapter, SDHC, - class 10 recommended.  Also, there is no printed manual - it comes on a CD.I also recommend a spare battery, especially for a full day of shooting and night-time events.  I get approximately 250 shots per charge.I have chosen to attach a UV filter to my camera as this reduces the  haze in some scenes.  More importantly though, the filter serves as a protection for my lens (which, being non-interchangeable would kill your camera if it got damaged).With the filter attached the lens cap no longer fits - which is fine for me as the filter provides the protection while allowing me to pick up my camera and start shooting right away without having to fiddle with a lens cap.To fit a filter or a lens hood you are going to need a 67mm adapter.  Canon supplies the FA-DC67A which works perfectly.Tripod and remote trigger (RS-60E3) are useful for those looking to do portrait or macro work.The camera has a hot shoe and accepts external flashes which puts it ahead of a number of its competitors.  My own shooting style doesn't require me to use an external flash and I only rarely do.  The built-in flash is fine for me.  Its nice to know this little camera can accept external flashes though.  You may search the Canon site for compatible speedlites.  Other suppliers' equipment works too.Image quality (IQ)In the end this is the reason we take photos.  To be honest this camera is not all-round brilliant in this area.  Which camera is?  However, It is unbeatable in good light where it approaches DSLR quality (no joke).Low-light pics are not as impressive - usable, but I've seen better using other high-end P&S; cameras.The \"hand-held night shot\" feature is a good alternative in many situations.  It shoots a composite of 4 photos to give the best result.  This eats up memory though and introduces lengthy buffering so it slows down night-time shooting - definitely not recommended for fast-moving events such as birthday parties.  HDR helps too.At full zoom in good light most pictures are very good.  Not DSLR quality (this is NOT a DSLR replacement) but truthfully most DSLR lenses would not be able to reach out that far to get those pics anyway so the SX50 still wins.I shoot mostly landscapes and birds on the weekends and I find that colors are very accurately captured.  There is some fringing noticeable but only on the most contrasty shots, and only at full size/resolution.  Pictures are not DSLR sharp but not far from it.  Size 3.5\" x 5\" and 4\"x6\" prints will be fine.  Pictures for posting on your social network page will be quite fine - brilliant even!This camera shines in: macro, landscape, architecture/still-life, moon-shots/astronomy (a category that competitors cannot even enter).  People shots are pleasing and more than satisfactory but not best-in-class.  For professional-looking portraits get a DSLR.VideoCanon packed a lot of goodies into its video capabilities and there is much to be impressed with here.  The Full-HD video is incomparable.  `Nuff said.  Moving up from the 720p of the SX120 the difference was clearly noticeable to me.Luckily Canon supplies an HDMI cable with this camera so you can view your amazing videos on your flat-screen TV.Super-slow motion is useful to have a closer look at your golf swing or capture your kids at sports day.Stills can be snapped while your video is running but this creates a split second break in filming and captures the shutter sound in your video.  No biggie.  Of course, you can always use photo-grab to get a photo from your videos.Stereo sound is captured via built-in dual microphones but there is no jack for an external mic.  You cannot get it all in a $400 camera!Zooming is available during video and zooming is quiet and precise.  The auto-focus is reasonably good but tricky scenes and rapid movement can leave your subjects out of focus for a while as the camera struggles to keep up.  There is a 30-minute limit on videos.  Keep it short.Don't expect to be Steven Spielberg with this camera but your vacation videos will be quite nice.Image stabilsation (IS)This is another area where the camera absolutely shines!  Most users will never need a tripod to get great shots out of this camera.  Hand-held shots are quite still even at full zoom.  This is especially true for users whose grip is strong and stable and whose subjects don't move much (like the buildings, plants and trees I photograph, haha).  Seriously though, Canon's lens-based IS system shines on all its P&S; cameras.  In the SX50 they really outdid themselves.Videos are quite steady even while the user is moving/walking/riding/driving.  Brilliant!Electronic viewfinder (EVF)This is my biggest disappointment with this camera.  Canon should not even be allowed to call this a viewfinder.  It is crappy!It can only be used to get a general sense of where your subject is in the frame - little detail is available.  Canon must at least quadruple the resolution on the next generation or forget about viewfinders.  In fairness, all screen overlay information is available in the viewfinder - but that's just me searching for an up-side.ScreenThis will be your savior from the horrible viewfinder just described.  Still, although Canon improved the resolution over 2 generations they are still behind the competition here.  It is usable, but not brilliant.  The best thing about it is the fact that it swivels.  Also, at 2.8\" it is slightly smaller than its competitors.There are four viewfinder/screen display options: overlay on and off, screen and viewfinder.  Hitting the \"Disp.\" button cycles you through that 4-step sequence. Tedious.  Other manufacturers use a toggle that implements a lot nicer and easier.  Some more work here Canon!PerformanceThe camera shoots at an impressive speed with a frame rate of up to 13 frames per second (fps) in hi-speed burst mode.  This means you can shoot 10 images of Junior blasting out of the blocks at his school track meet before they've gone 3 steps.  13fps is class-leading speed and users who shoot fast action will appreciate this feature.I found it a bit difficult to locate it in the menu though and even tougher to toggle between this and regular shooting modes for those in-between shots that don't require 10-frame bursts.  (In fairness, with practice one can develop the shutter control to shoot single frames even in hi-speed burst mode).With hi-speed burst shooting buffering will be an issue so users have to be careful of when to fire off their 10 frames because the camera will be unusable for another 3-5 seconds.  Even so, these frame rates are not numbers that most competitors can match, indeed the frame rate on most DSLRs are less than half of what the SX50 can do.Start up time is fast even if battery isn't fully charged.  Battery life trails this class of cameras at 315 frames per charge.  Still, 300+ pics per day is a lot of shooting for most casual users.FrillsMy shooting requirements don't involve me using a number of the features this camera has.  I call them frills - they may be more useful to other users, though.These include:* HDR - high dynamic range.  This feature exaggerates the dynamic range (differences in light and color intensity) in different parts of your image.  This has the effect of making photos more dramatic, but in some subjects produces overly-stylized and even grotesque results.  HDR works better on DSLRs that capture the subtle nuances in light more intelligently and gives more authentic results.  IMO* Fish-eye Effect, Miniature Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Soft Focus, Monochrome, Super Vivid, Poster Effect, Color accent and Color swap are all novelty effects that some shooters will use to bring variety to their images.  For me they are only \"nice to have\" since I rarely need them and can achieve most of them in post-production, if ever required.* Self-timer, blink detector and smile detector also fall into the nice-to-have category for me.There are many more - this camera is packed with extras.The \"frills\" that are not present but other users may miss include: GPS, wireless control and wi-fi.CHDKThe Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK) is open-source software that is available for most Canon Powershot cameras.  It is free and allows owners to make non-permanent, non-destructive software changes to their cameras.  These changes can turn your camera into a super device by removing most of the factory limitations.  Faster shutter speed, longer exposure times,  motion detector, intervalometer (for time lapse shooting) and bracketing are some of the new capabilities that can be added to your camera.I have not used CHDK myself and thus cannot vouch for it but its nice to know that the already awesome features of my Canon P&S; camera can be extended even further.SummaryThis camera was worth the 3-year wait for me.  It suits my needs perfectly.  There is no denying its weaknesses (low-light IQ, viewfinder) but for me its strengths make it totally worth its price.  Advanced beginners like myself will find this a useful intermediate step before diving into the DSLR world.  It is sufficiently full-featured to challenge you and develop your photography skills while being simple enough for a child to pick up and get good shots of daddy frantically screaming \"put that down!!\"For its 50x zoom and image stabilization it is a worthy choice.  Most importantly, image quality is top-notch in most situations.Pros* 50x zoom* Image stabilization* Image quality* Shoots RAW* Solid build quality* Advanced \"pro\" functions* Lightning speed burst mode* Articulating screen* Full HD video* Available accessories* CHDKCons* Unimpressive low-light performance* Viewfinder resolution* Sometimes confusing menu* No external mic jack* No GPS* No wirelessI have deliberately tried to make this review detailed enough to cover most questions that a new user will have but still easy enough to be understood by most.  And so I kept out a lot of the more technical terms that can be intimidating for beginners just looking for a decent point and shoot without having to pull out a photography glossary.  Hope it helped.  Happy snapping!!", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "SX50 vs. the SX40, and some other features of the SX50....", "Author": "Joseph W. Szilagy \"Joe Szilagy\"", "ReviewID": "R1H97RRFMHZOJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "JULY 29th, 2013 UPDATE!! ....Just read on the 'Fatdragon' site (a girl who has posted tons and tons of helpful insrtuctional videos on the SX40), that the SX50 has a 'Superfine' setting, which enhances sharpness even more! The funny thing is, even though I've had my SX50 for quite awhile now, I honestly hadn't even noticed! Why? I can only assume that it was because my older Canon DSLR had that setting, and had seen it so many times that I had simply taken it for granted as something that was on my SX40 (which I still have, by the way), and hadn't paid much attention too. So there's yet 'another' great reason to get the SX50! Now I want to try the 'Superfine' setting on mine, which I'm not sure I had even really used- after all this time!!I was prompted to write this review based on some comments I'd seen on YouTube or somewhere, where someone had proclaimed something about the Canon SX50HS, \"blowing away\" the SX40HS, or something to that affect. Well, I happen to now own both cameras, (being a musician, I realized that I had one or two guitars too many, after so many years, and decided to part with one in order to buy it), and having now had the SX50 for close to two weeks, I noticed a few other interesting things about it, which I'm not sure are mentioned in some other reviews....But first, the comment regarding the SX50 being vastly superior to the SX40? (drum roll, please).... Nonsense! In fact, the SX40 is a great camera, but in my opinion the SX50 is better, but while I hesitate to say 'a lot' better, I'd have to say more than a 'little' better. Already, reviews and descriptions above mention the most obvious differences, those being 15X more optical zoom, and greater digital zoom, the RAW feature, and better image stabilizer, etc.I would have to say that one or two videos on YouTube of people demonstrating the image stabilization is what finally made me want to get the SX50 afterall. That, plus the fact that (even here in Canada), I found it on sale already for only $6 more than I paid for the SX40 when I bought that about six months or so, ago. Oddly enough, it was on sale at a regular Sears store for considerably less than at camera stores, Best Buy, etc. Even as much as $100 difference, compared to some places! I should think that Amazon, and other places will have it for even less just before Christmas and on Boxing Day/week.DEC. 16th, 2012: UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! Recently found out that another Toronto camera store has it for $385, so took my receipt to Best Buy, had them check on the Internut (yes, that was intentional), and since it's still within 30 days, they not only reimbursed me that difference, but added the 10% difference in price, making the price of my SX50HS here in the Great White North a total of $383.50!! I wanted to share that because right about now, as well as Boxing Day/Week, would likely be the best time to check everywhere (do it here online to give your feet a rest before going!) Now I've actually paid less than what the SX40 cost me- while it was on sale! It won't likely go this low, or lower until next Fall or thereabouts. Of course, in the U.S. I expect it would be even less ($320-$350 perhaps?) here on Amazon, and other places during these next 2-3 weeks, so keep your eyes peeled!NOTE: Since the last update, I actually found the camera for $349.99 at Best Buy, rather 'hidden' online, since the continued Boxing Week sale filled up most of the website page. I decided not to search the online flyer (which listed it for $399.99 the week before), and just type in 'Canon SX50', in the the window above. Much to my surprise, it was listed there for $349.99! Unfortunately, this was only minutes before midnight on the last day of the sale! Had I gone to the store earlier that day with that knowledge, I would have also gotten the 10% difference discount, which would have then brought the price down to about $346! I went the next day, but they said basically that it was too late, but I still got it knocked down a further few dollars due to another price match. Moral of the story? Keep checking all your local store's websites every Friday, or whenever they post the new sales prices, which also includes Amazon. I once bought an amazing Michael Palin travel boxset (which was regularly about $250), for around $120 on Amazon, but that sale was listed for only one day! Be vigilant!Back to review......The first difference I noticed, once I took the SX50 out of the box, was the (intentionally) rougher exterior, which I liked immediately, regarding 'slippage'. Of course, the more recessed grip also helps. Cosmetically, the SX50 is more attractive, and more 'professional' looking, with it's more angular body compared to the 'rounder' look of the SX40. Even the shiny piece of plastic on the outside of the lens barrel I find attractive. Not that these things are incredibly important!The next thing I noticed was the movie record button being conveniently placed near the edge of the right side, within very easy grasp. The two new framing assist buttons also help, located on the barrel as well. Again, (mainly concerning cosmetics), but perhaps also ease of use, is what looks to me to be a more traditional looking mode dial atop the camera, along with a better- and again, more 'pro- looking'- lens cap. Once again, not that those things are astoundingly important.As far as photo and video quality goes, I would have to say that (for the most part) they seem to be pretty much exact. Even though, (at the full 200X digital setting), the quality isn't as good as the SX40's full 140X, it still surpasses the SX40 digitally 'before' reaching 200X, when exceeding the 140X equivalent of the SX40, at least to my eye, and also when comparing videos I've seen that others have posted. Or, I guess you could say it's just as good 'past' the equivalent of the farthest SX40 digital images, yet not quite to the full 200X, which is still better overall.The swing out, adjustable LCD screen is noticibly sharper than on the SX40, which is good for checking out very fine detail when focusing, but again, the resulting photo and video quality on whatever medium you choose is pretty much the same from both cameras overall.In very low light, (especially outside at night), the SX40 autofocus works a little better but, at the same distance equivalent, the SX50 may be just as effective- it's when you go 'beyond' with what the SX50 can comfortably do, that you notice a difference. And, of course, the higher ISO settings help out somewhat, though I doubt many people would care for 6400 ISO images. But even 3200, isn't all that bad- on both cameras! Seems I read somewhere that Canon figured out a way to 'smooth out' images a little in that respect, and while using digital zoom.Regarding complaints here and there about this and other similiar cameras having an aperture being above 2.8 or whatever at the low end, I could have sworn that even much more expensive powerful interchangable zoom lenses for DSLRs have higher apertures as well. I just assumed that it got higher as the zoom becomes bigger, like on the 100 to 300mm lens I used to have, or the 35 to 105mm which I still have for my Canon DSLR which is 3.5 to 4.5.Another interesting thing I noticed today was that I can adjust the exposure on my SX40 'while' filming, which I can't do on the SX50! On the SX40, I have to start recording first, 'then' I can adjust the little exposure bar on the bottom of the screen. With the SX50, I have to adjust the exposure first, then start recording, and can't adjust the bar further, even though it still appears. (If any SX50 owners know how to overcome this, please let me know!) It does come in handy on the SX40, and even the exposure adjustment wasn't exactly described in it's manual- in so far as being operative 'while' actually recording- I still stumbled upon it somehow. Perhaps there's a way to 'trick' it into happening on the SX50! Either that, or I'd better study the manual more in depth!In the effects part of the dial, there are also some new modes in the SX50 such as 'soft focus' and HDR, along with the previous 'minature', fisheye', etc., which are a lot more impressive, and less gimmicky looking than one might think, if you take the time to really try them.Somewhere I read something from someone, (here, or elsewhere online), claiming that this camera could not achieve the attractive image of the main subject being in focus, with the background intentionally having the soft, blurred focus when seen by an interchangable telephoto lens used with a DSLR. Well, I'm not sure what setting they used, and under what conditions, but I'm very pleased to say that, 'YES', you can achieve that type of image with this camera- and that applies to both the SX50 and the SX40!I noticed the two tiny stereo mics are located high atop the camera in front of the hotshoe, as opposed to the SX40 where they are located below the flash and just above the top of the lens in the recessed area. I haven't tried audio recording yet, but I would imagine there's some difference, and reason for the change.Finally, two other small differences I noticed were the addition of a 'remote terminal' under the tiny door on the right side, and a much easier to open battery compartment door on the bottom of the camera. In time I may discover other small differences, aside from everything that people have already mentioned that I haven't.Lastly, I like having the two similiar cameras, whereby I can use either as a spare, and the SX40 sometimes in certain low light situations, or the SX50 in brighter light, plus not fussing and worrying so much over one camera, when there's two. It's also nice having two identical batteries and chargers, so that I can take both batteries, (fully charged), along with one camera so as not to have to worry about running out of power too soon.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two Minute Guide to Super Zoom Bridge Cameras", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R12OUAUYIHF7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Two Minute Guide to Super Zoom Bridge CamerasBy way of a mercifully brief introduction, I make a goodly portion of my living with the use of digital cameras, and have for a very long time. My applications are wildlife and the outdoors, product reviews, industry consulting work, and legal work. Part of the territory is optics, whether binoculars, laser rangefinders, scopes, or cameras. Image examples are readily found online and in print from numerous devices, you can check the latest issue of African Adventures magazine if you wish.We all have different eyes, heads, hands, fingers, and divergent uses for cameras. Nothing replaces a bit of quality hands on time with any camera, for what feels good to me might feel too large or too small to you. It is of course why we try on clothes and take test drives: there is no one size fits all and cameras are not excluded from that. Some folks may consider video capability of great importance. Many buying cameras have no interest in video at all.Only you can decide what fits your hands and your needs. Whether you think a camera is too heavy, too bulky, or too light and too dinky, you're always right. Some may find a 1-1/2 pound camera a lightweight dream as opposed to a system camera and lenses that totals 30 pounds or more. Yet, the bridge camera-class in its entirety could just as easily be considered horrifically overweight pigs, compared to a 7 ounce shirt pocket camera. I'm calling a bridge camera a small-sensor non-interchangeable lens camera, with at least 35x zoom range, and a 1000mm maximum focal length for purposes of this article.Fuji HS50EXRThis Fuji currently sells for under $400, has the largest and most advanced sensor of the cameras very briefly covered here, is the heaviest of the group at 28.5 ounces, has the fastest auto focus and zoom. This Fuji has a Its 24mm to 1000mm zoom range. It also has an articulated LCD at a pleasing 920K resolution, as well as an electronic viewfinder of 920K dots as well. It is capable of the best images of this group of cameras, although it takes a bit of work to explore and embrace the 1/2 inch EXR CMOS II sensor.With phase-detection auto-focus and enough features to suggest you download and peruse the HS50 manual (or brochure) for details, this camera may sound like the best of breed. Well, it certainly could be considered that, to some it is. However, the zoom is manual: a reason you will either love this camera or hate it. The manual zoom makes it difficult for smooth-zooming operation during video, so what is its great strength to some is also a weakness at the same time.Fuji SL1000A bargain at $290 street price (as low as $250!), the 28.5 oz. SL1000, uses the smaller 1/2.33 sensor (compared to the HS50), yet is still a 24-1200mm 35mm equivalent camera. It also loses 25%-35% of the HS-50's its price as well. While light in price, it isn't light enough to carry, and the lack of a fully articulated LCD is a slight negative (if you want to be in the picture), though it does tilt enabling overhead shots. In most ways, the Fuji is the better general purpose camera than the Canon SX-50: better EVF, better LCD, far better rubbery grip, slightly better battery life, better video, and a $70 - $120 or so lower price tag as a bonus. The SL1000 also has the panorama mode that Canon still ignores as well.Canon SX-50Claimed to be the world's first 24-1200mm or 50x zoom bridge, it now has a lot of company. At 21 ounces, it sheds almost a half pound as compared to the Fuji HS50EXR. The electronic viewfinder is 202K and unimpressive. The 460K articulated LCD is very well done, but small, as now there are higher resolution (and larger) displays out there. Its video mode is excellent but limited, *if* you shoot at 720p and 30 frames per second. It lacks an auto-panorama feature, its lens is slightly dim compared to many, but it is a fun camera to use with a balanced level of performance that suits me extremely well for wildlife and the outdoors, even if technically it falls short on some features compared to the Fuji HS50 and has a slippery build compared to the SL1000.Panasonic FZ-70With a 20-1200mm (60X) range, the latest from Panasonic has built-in marketing hyperbole. At 21.44 ounces, it is minimally and trivially heavier than the Canon. It shares a 202K viewfinder with the Canon, though, and lacks the Canon's articulated LCD which is a huge, inexplicable deficiency. The Panasonic LCD does not even pull out and tilt, forcing you to rely on the lackluster EVF more than you would want to. Overhead shots, as in shooting above a crowd are not possible. The Chinese build quality here is just average, and the non-Leica branded lens seems to be average as well. The images are soft, particularly at the long end, and its burst mode of only three images maximum is disappointing as well. It was a disappointment to me, compared to the rest of the pack.Sony HX300The Sony HX300 is the most expensive camera of the group, takes somewhat soft pictures, but has very good video. At 22.9 ounces, it isn't much heavier than most of these cameras, but it looks and feels bulky. It lacks a hot shoe, captures no RAW images, but its  f2.8-6.3 24-1200mm lens is slightly brighter than some, even if it doesn't translate to wondrous image quality. While its LCD does not swivel out, it does pull back and tilt. It is *sorely overpriced at $400 street* compared to the better-featured SL1000 @ $250.Nikon P520At 19.4 ounces, the P520 is the lightest of this group. Its 1000mm reach is still substantial, if not class-leading. No hot shoe, but it does have a GPS, and an excellent articulated LCD, but does not capture RAW. Its auto-focus and shot to shot shooting performance is relatively slow, the slowest of this entire group of cameras. Its battery life is unacceptably weak at 200 shots CIPA standard.SummaryThere is no such thing as a bridge camera that competes, in image quality, with a system camera, whether Micro 4/3 or the larger APS-C sensors used in D-SLR product. The core technology that allows for usable images from a small-sensor camera, along with HD video, is the Back Side Illumination metal oxide semi-conductor (BSI-MOS) that is a commonality on all these cameras, with only Fuji going with a both a bit larger sensor and different technology in their  HS50EXR.Every single one of these cameras can take thoroughly enjoyable and usable images under excellent shooting conditions. So can shirt-pocket cameras, so can smartphones. They have been doing just that for many, many years.There are differences between these cameras, of course. The importance of the differences cannot be universally quantified, for video capability means nothing to the prospective owner that wants to take no video. Those looking for a right or wrong in these cameras won't find it, for RAW capability might mean something to you or it might mean nothing at all for those that don't want to process images again and again. What the price differences might mean to you are completely up to you as well, for although there are differences it isn't exactly at the dinner and dancing for four level.Here's how I rate them and why. Naturally your intended use, your personal preferences has just about everything to do with how you view them. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so it all depends on who exactly is doing the beholding.BEST VALUE: Fuji SL1000No other name-brand camera gets you to the massive 1200mm range for $290 or less, sometimes much less. No one shoots at 1200mm all the time, or even most of the time for that matter. If you want the capability to do so, the SL1000 gets you there the most affordably. It offers a better EVF and LCD than the more expensive FZ70 and many of the others. Give it good light and it takes excellent images, for the most common end uses (snap shots, internet).BEST STILL IMAGE BRIDGE CAMERA: Fuji HS50EXRThe most capable, with the fastest autofocus, the most shooting options, the easiest manual zoom, the most advanced (and largest sensor) is the Fuji HS50EXR. It isn't my favorite, for weighing a half pound more is a significant negative for my uses, as is the manual zoom for video. It is bulky as well, with around an inch more of depth than others. Though I find it to be more than I want to carry in the field, others of course may equally feel its weight to be liberating, compared to system cameras. Phase-detection auto-focus breaks new ground in this class of camera.BEST ALL-AROUND 1200mm BRIDGE CAMERA: Canon SX-50 or the Fuji SL1000While not a spectacular standout in many areas, the Canon SX-50 is an appealing compromise. Its CIPA battery life of 315 shots (335 with the EVF) isn't all that great, but compared to the Nikon P520's 200 shots it is. Nor is its 202K EVF anything special, but it does have an articulated LCD that I feel is mandatory for this class of camera. Its shooting speed is good, particularly as compared to the sluggish Nikon, and is competitive in this category. Though released in late 2012 with a $480 retail price, it is now available for $329 or so.One thing that Canon offers that is class-leading is the current SX-50 image stabilization and its video performance (at 720p, 30 fps) is excellent, if not super-high resolution.The DIGIC 5 now has 58 shooting modes in Smart Auto mode, making this camera extremely user-friendly when you need to get that shot without having available time to adjust and experiment, though a goodly array of manual controls along with RAW capture is available. The \"gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400\" that Canon brags about is a bit of wishful thinking (okay, a lot of wishful thinking), but this camera does surprisingly well at ISO 1600: better than I could have imagined.As a few of my British friends would say, the Canon SX-50 is a nice piece of kit. In particular, the zoom assist button located on the top of the left side of the lens housing is a truly outstanding feature, one that I use regularly. The red button, to go instantly to video mode is on the back of the housing where it is easy to access, no searching needed. The diopter adjustment for the electronic viewfinder is nicely nested to the left of the EVF: and so, is hard to inadvertently knock out of adjustment. The SX-50 is full of thoughtful touches like these, some useful, some clearly in the just for fun category.As a side note, the supplied factory battery is 920 mAh. The Canon series is popular, so very economical aftermarket batteries with better capacity are readily available. I added Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Canon NB-10L, CB-2LC and Canon PowerShot G1 X, G15, G16, SX40 HS, SX50 HS to take care of my battery needs. Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) is my choice in daily use bags for this unit. The Wasabi branded replacement battery is a 9.6 Watt Hour battery vs. the 6.8 Wh OEM battery, offering about 40% longer life. If you are getting 315 shots out of your SX-50 with the factory battery, you can expect 440 shots or so with the Wasabi replacement.Yet, the Fuji SL1000 feels better in the hands and is the generally better-featured camera at a substantially lower price. Some will buy the Canon based on its brand-name (I bought it before the SL1000 was introduced). If value is a large component of your purchase, the Fuji can't be beat. Both cameras need lots of light particularly at longer focal lengths, and both give their best output at ISO 400 or lower.\u00a92013 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.

I was not thrilled with this camera.  Having owned and used the SX40 extensively, I found that the low-light focusing of this SX50 leaves a lot to be desired.  The camera,  in anything less than daylight conditions,  focuses very slowly or not at all though focus in good light is readily achieved and appears fairly speedy and accurate.  Essentially, this is just a decent good light/bright light camera and should be viewed as such.The auto white balance is horrendous which necessitates the need to use one of the presets or use a custom WB setting.  Image quality is really just so-so and nothing over 400 ISO is good for anything but small prints, email, or the web.  Smearing, noise and loss of detail begins at 400 ISO and quickly degrades afterwards.  Because the lens is not very fast, you'll find the camera defaulting to higher ISO levels more often than not with mediocre results at best.I did not check the video capabilities.  The EVF is needed in many extremely sunny and bright daylight situations, but its low resolution and smearing makes it almost more of a hassle than the LCD.  The diopter adjustment is poorly implemented, difficult to adjust, and doesn't remain at the chosen setting.This is not, in my opinion, an everyday camera; however it does fill the niche for birders, wildlife photographers, etc.  The zoom is remarkable; however, it comes at a cost and unless you are a affirmed \"zoom-head,\" your money can be better spent with another Canon, Nikon, or Fuji.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Much improved over the SX40 and here's why... (SEE PHOTOS)", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "R1D79I0WRHTYSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an experienced nature photographer, having been at it for over 50 years. I have been using Canon's PowerShot cameras going back to the S3. My relationship with these cameras has been a love-hate one, but the SX40 was a \"Like\" and this is \"Really-Like-but-Love-is-too strong-a-word.\"See uploaded photos (click on \"most recent\") many of which have been published in birding magazines as well as with Audubon societies. But remember, I know this camera...This should NOT be your first-time-digital point and shoot camera! The learning curve is way too sharp because this camera is quite complex, and has unnecessary bells and whistles that you should avoid (at least until you learn the basics).What did I think about this camera? Well, after doing an awful lot of research, *I bought two* even after there had been a \"recall\" which I still don't understand! (One of these was for my wife.) I am a pro turned amateur nature photographer, and have been for many years. As for digital, I have had the Canons S3, S5, SX10, SX20, SX30 (returned immediately), SX40, and now the SX50.After you've played with the SX50 for a couple of days, I'd be happy to send my standard settings if you just email me. Here are the improvements over the SX40 and all SX models that preceded this (you can see the progression on my web site (see my profile).The good:1. Shutter lag is minimal! You can shoot in burst mode of 7-9 frames per second depending with the mode you're in, but shutter lag has been cut by 70%. Canon says that you can shoot up to 13 frames per second. Not with this camera, but 7 should be sufficient.2. Fast focus with center metering. The SX40 (and other like cameras) want to focus \"on an average\" of all the elements in a shot. Unfortunately, anything that uses the term average is like the guy with his head in the refrigerator and his feet in the oven, and on average, he's comfortable. It just doesn't work that way ... which is why you should also steer clear of \"Auto.\" (More later) So, basically, if there's a bird on a branch in the center of a bunch of branches and twigs, the SX50 WILL focus on the bird and usually on the first try.3. Super Fine Mode. The SX40 goes to Fine resolution, but still left noise (the \"snow\" you'll see when cropped a distant shot of a bird etc.). For lack of a better way of putting this, Super Fine Resolution gives you many more pixels making the shot \"tighter\" and easier to crop without losing definition.4. Burst (continuous) Mode: This will hit a top speed of 9 frames per second. That's maximum, but if you can find a bird in flight, you stand a pretty good chance to get at least one frame in focus. It could be the bird's butt as it's leaving, but it will be in focus. There IS a locking device called High Speed AF (two buttons to the left of the lens). I am still trying to master this, and it will come to me ... I hope. So far, it feels like I'm trying to play an accordion with both hands doing something. I am pretty good at panning, but finding a bird in flight in the fully extended zoom is difficult. High Speed AF should correct that problem.NOTE: In order to get the most from burst mode, reducing shutter lag, etc., be certain to get a SDHC card! You need a fast card to maximize some of the aspects of the camera. Also, because the files will be much larger than what some are used to, I use a 16GB CLASS 10 card,* but 32GB CLASS 10 when on vacation in Yellowstone, Rainier, Bryce, Yosemite, in other words, anywhere where I'll be taking as many as 1,000 shots a day. And yes, especially with burst mode, you can easily take 1,000 pix on a vacation day. A Class 10 card will transfer 10 MG per second. If you want to - and you will - take pictures in burst mode, you need that speed between card and camera processor.5. Low light: Well, it isn't a disappointment because I expected this. You're buying a camera with a one chip sensor as opposed to 6-9 with a DSLR. The lens does allow more light than the SX40, but it still isn't a DSLR. Indoors, I recommend a flash.6. I have 9 settings that I use very often, but not all the time. One of the most critical difference is the white balance so that I don't blow out the whites of birds, goats, even recently bathed dogs. You can store ALL of your favorite settings in two modes C1 and C2. I store my settings for bright, sunny days in C1, and for low light or cloudy days in C2.7. IMAGE STABILIZATION: There's IS and then there's IS. The SX50, for a one-bit processor, has marvelous IS. I took shots of my TV's \"What's playing\" menu at 1/5 of a second (that's SLOWWWW!), hand held, and it was so sharp that my optometrist could actually see what I was complaining about, ghosting of letters and numbers on a white background. There are several photos I posted here that were taken hand-held at 1200mm (full zoom), and they're tack-sharp. Note that I haven't used a tripod or monopod since my 35mm SLR film days.8. Weight: 21 ounces and a 1200mm zoom! Those who carry a 6 pound camera around on a hiking day, often wish for the SX50. (I have a friend who carried a 34 pound camera and tripod who recently underwent back surgery, no kidding! Of course, neither of us is a young, fit 45.)The disappointments:1. RAW. All I've heard from my brother - a photographer for 65 years (but he takes pix of people and buildings, not of birds, bugs, bees, badgers, or bison) - has been touting the value of RAW. Well, the SX50 gives you a choice of shooting in RAW or RAW AND jpeg. Because the size of these files is 4 times more than a jpeg alone, continuous/burst mode just doesn't work. The processor can't process that much without a delay. And it increases shutter lag like waiting for a dialup connection!2. Auto. I don't like Auto. As I said Auto is \"average,\" and that's the results you'll get. I suggest you learn TV, AV, and then Manual to get the most of this camera. (Again, I'll be glad to send my settings and save you trouble. 99% of the time, I shoot in shutter priority, Tv = \"Time value\" whatever that means.)3. MINOR disappointment: battery life. Look, this camera is doing so much more and processing so much information that it uses more battery power. I change the battery at least once every time I go out. At least it uses the same battery as the SX40. I carry two extra batteries - reasonably priced on Amazon - whenever I hike.4. Related to battery life, the SX50 doesn't give you a choice to leave the camera in an \"always on\" mode. The camera will turn off in 2 minutes which can be problematic when you see something you want to shoot at the last second. Turning the camera on can take 2 seconds. Birds, dogs, and kids under the age of 10 don't sit still for more than 1.5 seconds.5. The Viewfinder: I will not buy or even use a camera without an Electronic Viewfinder. The one on the SX50 is still small, no bigger than on the SX40. It does the job, but not until you get your photos on a 23 inch monitor will you be absolutely sure that they're in focus. I use the LCD for a preview of what I just took, but remember that a 3\" LCD will make your pix look sharp whereas a HD monitor will tell the truth. The LCD is perhaps a good way to take a macro (though I usually zoom and crop).6. The ISO \"Button:\" For some stupid reason, Canon went and switched the ISO setting button from the right side to the bottom of the wheel in the back, and they went and put the Self-Timer on the right. That exactly where you're most likely to hit the button with your right thumb. It's a terrible idea because the getting out of the Self-timer is a two step button pushing process, and that takes a couple of seconds or more while you're trying to get a shot of something that won't wait for you.Of interest, but not to me: I won't take videos with this camera (I did once with the SX40), but I really think that if you're looking for a camera for movies of your kid's soccer, little league, or gymnastics, start with some step up from a smart phone and, if you have the money, a camcorder with image stabilization. If you do want to shoot wildlife videos, you definitely will want a tripod.Also, don't ask me about the Clear Face, Fireworks, parties, Color Accept, Swap Colors, or the other whistles (I'm a bell man) that I find gimmicky. I mean, you'd think that \"Clear Face\" would also get rid of acne! I understand the marketing value, but fooling around with these should wait until you can take a sharp photo of your dog or weasel or kid before you decide that they'd look nicer with a green complexion and yellow fur.If you're willing to take some time (2 to 4 weeks) to nail the basics, then this may well be THE camera for you. It is NOT for rank amateurs, and it probably won't satisfy most pros who are already into DSLRs. But if you want photos that are tack-sharp with a camera that's easy to use AND carry, and you're willing to learn the basics beyond Auto, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "One of the best but not perfect", "Author": "Giancarlos Dangelo", "ReviewID": "R2DM8P9OYV8NB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now is my turnIs no camera in this planet like the human EYE period.PROS1 Camera effect for change colors good2 Zoom is super ok but don't go up to 1200mm pictures are not that sharp but has a nice effect3 For Zooming use VIVID not NATURAL4 Better than many point and shoot around the market I will said the best5 Low noise in low light6 Building distortion are acceptable better than many expensives nikon lenses7 Macro is super, shoot a bird,butterfly or flowers as a distance of 10 feet8 Manual mode is better than SX 409 Tripod is required for zoom at long distance  but don,t have to for close range,sharp pictures are better when shooting with tripod10 No panorama mode but a good CPL (Moose's) will do a better job of course you need the adapter 67mm for eliminate vignetingCONS1 Canon is going bankrupt or they are saving money for the employee christmas bonus NO USB CABLE NO HOT SHOE COVER NO VIDEO CABLES, Hey CANON sale the camera without box probably you will save $2.00 in ink and cartoon.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "What this camera CAN and CANNOT do!", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R21SXYATCGAWKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short and sweet... Why would this semi-pro photographer/graphic designer buy this plasticky, consumer camera when he already has a Canon 5D Mark II with lots of good \"L\" glass with decent reach (up to 300 mm). Well there are three reasons:FIRST and most important, the REACH of this little camera is AMAZING! I took a photo of a turkey vulture walking about 25 feet away from the driver's seat of my car through the rolled-down passenger window (I'll upload it to Amazon). Even from that distance, the amount of detail was amazing! There is no way I could have gotten that shot with my 300 mm lens on my SLR. Heck, even if I owned a 800 mm lens that costs $12,000, I still couldn't get that shot because 1) I could even lift that lens, 2) there's no way I could maneuver that lens inside my car, and 3) I couldn't hold that lens steady because I would be crying because I dumped $12,000 on a lens. 1200 mm lens for $400 bucks! Amazing!SECOND reason: BOKEH! Bokeh is the background blur produced by a lens. That why folks like SLR cameras--the big sensors allow lenses to be produced that can be opened wide open to produce those artsy portraits with blurred out backgrounds. The problem with small sensors on consumer cameras is that the physics of everything makes it difficult to produce ANY decent bokeh. However, because the Canon SX50 has such an amazingly long zoom, it can produce some decent background blur. Is it as good as my SLR with a 50mm 1.4 lens? No way! My SLR with good lens produced a MUCH smoother backgrounds. But the Canon SX50 isn't bad considering how small the sensor is. Not bad at all! Actually, it's sort of a miracle that a sensor this small can produce ANY background blur!THIRD, there are MANY times where I really wished that I had my camera, but I didn't because it's a pain to lug around my SLR with a big lens. So I have plenty of missed opportunities. About two weeks ago, a bald eagle landed on the cross on top of my church. And the morning light was perfect! How I wished that I had my SLR with long lens! But I would have looked like a dork for bringing that setup to church. The only camera I had was my iPhone. Suffice to say, the iPhone was worthless and the eagle looked like a tiny dot. However, if I had a Canon SX50 with me, I'm sure that I would have bagged some amazing shots. Since the SX50 is so small, I will be carrying this camera with me at all times. No more miss shots for me! Being a good photographer has a lot to do with being at the right place at the right time (but even that doesn't help unless you have some decent gear on you).So that's it. The SX50 is just another tool in the bag. I'm still using my SLR/big lenses. Now I have more options (and I'll still be able to feed the family).UPDATE 3/21/13Amazing reach! This past weekend, I went on a boat tour on the St. John's River in Florida. I had both my Canon 5D Mark II with 300mm lens and the SX50. We came across two Barred Owls and the SLR with 300mm lens simply did not have enough reach. So I got out the SX50 and got some terrific photos. The reaction time of the SX50 simply cannot compare with the SLR (so I had to take lots of shots to make sure that I had a few keepers). And there is no question that photos with the SX50 have more grain--the SLR does much better in low light. But I'll take some grain for better reach any day!

I am not bothered by the weight of the camera but actually enjoy having something to hang onto when I am trying to take shots. I also love that this camera has both a viewfinder and a screen so you can choose which you use to take photos. So many cameras I looked at did not have a viewfinder and I use one quite regularly. It costs just slightly more than I paid for my Kodak eight years ago so I am pleased with the price as well.

Just fasten the SX50 to a table-top tripod securely, set it on a cold car hood outside, fold out the rotating LCD, and you're ready to shoot the Moon and larger planets, without worrying about a cool-down period, fiddling with complex multi-part equipment, or needing anything but the zoom to locate objects.

For the Moon for example, on the right days of the month with a good sky, my SX50 will faithfully image all 5 significant craters inside Clavius, plus Rupes Recta (the Straight Wall) above it.

With a telescopic glass solar filter held in front of the lens (BE CAREFUL!), the camera can also image sunspots during the day. The rings of Saturn plus the bands and moons of Jupiter are a little more challenging, and may require the use of manual exposure mode, plus manual focus, plus the 2X or 4X digital teleconverter, but usable results can still be obtained with perseverance.

As with any large construction project, many pictures are taken during the construction and inspection process to measure progress, capture and study problem areas and verify inspections for record keeping.  Since climbing to significant heights is dangerous for all, it should be left to trained and skilled Iron Workers.  So, how do you get closeup pictures of small construction details in difficult to reach, high elevation locations?  The answer is the superzoom camera.  I used to use an older, 12:1 zoom, 5mp camera and it was great, but compared to that, the SX50 HS is fantastic! Since it has a 50:1 Optical zoom combined with an additional 4:1 digital zoom and 12.1mp, it is possible to get up to 200:1 magnification.  With this, I can read small hand writing on an inspection point in a structure at over 100 feet away, and any other details I want, all while staying safe on the ground or a secure platform.

Read on...", "Author": "Lovemonger1", "ReviewID": "RGYBD0U44MCKB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera overall.  The image quality is excellent in terms of detail, color accuracy, saturation, sharpness, consistency, and depth of field at all aperture settings. I tested six other competitive cameras in the super-zoom/bridge camera category, and this is the camera I ultimately purchased.So . . . the end results are very good; however, I have a number of complaints concerning the poor design and ergonomics of this camera.  Read on . . .The absolute MOST annoying design flaw is that the self-timer button is the far right \"wing\" tab of the circular function wheel which is located, as one holds it, on the very far right-hand edge of the back of the camera body. This is a most unfortunate location for this or any other control button, since almost every time you pick up, pass, or hold the camera to shoot, the heel of your palm or your thumb inadvertently presses this button and activates the timer - GRRRRR!  Often this cannot be corrected with just a single button press, as the timer has a number of elapsed time options and you may have to depress the button numerous times to turn the timer off and commence shooting!  One has to learn how to delicately and unnaturally hold the camera to prevent this from occurring, and even then it happens consistently despite one's best efforts. Canon has tried to ameliorate the problem by designing a thumb-trough with grip nodules swaled into the camera back to help guide your hand into a holding position that will not trigger the timer; this helps a tad, but the resulting hand position, requiring that right-handed folks support the camera with the pressure of the ball of one's thumb is neither natural nor intuitive, and it detracts from one's ability to hold the camera steady.  This flaw drives me out of my mind, to be honest, and if it were not for the camera's good performance which has forced me to learn to live with this perpetual frustrating annoyance, this would be a total deal-breaker.If Canon improves nothing else in its next iteration of this camera, fixing this issue is a must-do. It would be so simple to relocate the timer button, or move the function wheel a millimeter or two to the left and away from the edge of the camera body which is used for gripping, even if that would mean shrinking the LCD screen a touch or making the camera a fraction wider.Second major issue:  the electronic LCD viewfinder's resolution at a mere 202k dots, frankly speaking, is absolute junk compared with competitors in this bridge camera category and price range, all of which at least more than quadruple this resolution spec! I use an EVF a lot, and it is almost essential if you want to take photos in bright light or shoot extended telephoto shots without camera-shake blur. There is no excuse for so poor an EVF. And the diopter adjustment wheel is EXTREMELY difficult to operate - fortunately, you can set it for yourself and forget it after the first grueling five minutes of fingertip-shredding adjustment, but if you want to pass your camera to someone else to use, forget them ever being able to adjust it to their own vision prescription!Related to the EVF inferiority is the inconvenient location of the button which alternates the photographer's view between the EVF and the LCD screen, and its inconvenient operation. This button is located on the bottom right of the camera back, and you must pull the camera well away from your face to locate and operate it. Moreover, since the button is one of many dual-function buttons on the camera, you must press it twice quickly to change the views -- silly, and it slows down composition and shooting. This camera either needs a well-designed automatic EVF switching sensor, or else the button needs to be relocated -- ideally to the left side of the flash unit near the [hopefully-soon-to-be-redesigned] diopter wheel, where it belongs!Some good news:  the telephoto (1,200 mm equivalent, optical, plus additional power in the digital realm) is amazing. With practice and technique, you can actually eliminate most camera-shake blur, even at such an extreme focal length (especially with the use of the aforementioned low-rez EVF).  There is also a button on the side of the lens housing that further locks in the image stabilization - although this is a bit clumsy to use, and why Canon couldn't build that tweak into the actual stabilization algorithm, I don't know -- especially since the button is quite difficult to locate by feel, even with practice, and often jars the camera when one has to depress it against the lens barrel, thus defeating its efficacy entirely!Personally, I could do with better image stabilization and less zoom - let's face it, 1,200 mm + digital zoom is simply overkill; 1,000 mm optical, tops (like almost all its competitors in this camera class), would be plenty, and the zoomed images would perforce be more consistently clearer due to more manageable image-stabilization at the extreme focal lengths. If you give folks a massive zoom capability, they are going to want to use it -- and the greater the telephoto length, the more difficult it is to keep the image stable and produce blur-free pictures.In short, one is forced to conclude that this camera was designed by individuals who never subjected it to actual-use-testing in the field, or these flaws would never have made it to market.More on the plus side:  low light / indoor wide-angle and telephoto performance is incredible, even though the telephoto aperture max is limited to f3.4, so not as good as a certain manufacturer's recent model I could name whose low-light telephoto performance is one of its main claims to fame.  Nevertheless, a flash is seldom necessary -- photos are well-lit and non-noisy unless the room is very dim -- and when it is necessary, the flash intensity can be adjusted and is overall pretty non-glary. At greater telephoto lengths in dim light the camera does often have to \"hunt\" for focus, resulting in a lot of noisy lens extension and retraction buzzes and grinds that, to be honest, don't have a pleasing high-quality mechanical sound to them!There are in-camera adjustable settings for contrast, sharpness, and saturation, among other color tweaks, although there is no noise-reduction adjustment. So far, the latter tweak has not proved necessary. These settings are buried a bit deeply within the Program menus, and initially I could not locate them. Thankfully, an early reader of this now-edited review directed me to them, and the easy way to find them is as follows: enter Program mode, then press the FUNC SET (shortcut) button; from there, navigate to Colors (default: \"My Colors Off\"); scroll right to \"Custom Color\", then press DISP button; you may now scroll up and down to the different color adjustment settings. Note that these adjustments are not available in the stripped-down Intelligent Auto shooting mode, but I find the default settings in that mode to render excellent and accurate results (see next paragraph).Very often I like to shoot spontaneously and on the fly, and thus often do not like to do a lot of fiddling with aperture, ISO, or other settings, so I make good use of the convenient memory and shortcut settings that you can pre-set and store for fast switching under various shooting conditions. Most amazing of all, and perhaps the biggest selling point for this camera -- aside from the image quality -- is just how outstanding photos taken with the no-brainer Intelligent Auto setting are!  This setting produces incredibly good photos under all conditions, a fact that continually blows my mind. My only complaint here is that this setting results in focus-area-indicator \"boxes\" appearing on the screen that often are not centered on the subject one wishes to focus upon, necessitating perhaps even a few refocusing efforts (using the typical half-depress of the shutter button). This can be a pain, but one gets used to it.The Menu is intuitive and easy to navigate, and can be customized to one's preference (with limitations) for quick setting changes. Unlike the EVF, the LCD display screen is of very good resolution and has adjustable brightness. However, it only swings out to the left side of the camera and tilts up and down, compared to competitors' camera displays that swivel and tilt into a variety of angles.Elapsed time from turn-on to shoot is very fast -- no complaints at all there. Also, the camera shoots and processes quickly, with what seems like slightly less-than-average shutter lag time. This performance is considerably better than the competitors I tested which either shot / processed faster but with poorer and / or more inconsistent image quality, or else shot great images but more slowly with glacially long periods between shots that consisted of a totally black screen (requiring you to re-compose your picture between every shot, further slowing down the ability to shoot quickly).The owner's manual is very lengthy (273 pages, excluding Specifications pages), convoluted, and most sections are loaded with cross-references to other pages and sections, making instructions very laborious and confusing to follow as you attempt to flip back and forth between all the cross-references and sub-cross references-- ESPECIALLY when trying to read the manual on an electronic screen -- since of course, like all cameras these days, the manual is only available on an in-box CD-R or in pdf form online.  These flaws make the manual virtually impossible to use.  In general, it is poorly-organized and poorly-written, and the index is a bit, shall we say, casual. However, although it is no defense, this is not a fault unique to Canon, as I'm sure is common knowledge.  Fortunately, there are online services which for a reasonable price will produce a hard (printed) copy of the manual, in 8'' x 11'' and / or 5'' x 8.5'' sizes that are ring-bound so that they will lie flat while you stare at the text and scratch your head wondering who the heck wrote this thing and what they are trying to say.  I found the larger version very handy because its large-print format was easier to read and left plenty of room for my many annotations, corrections, and bits of crucial editing. The smaller version is handy to carry with into the field or traveling. The service I used gives a discount rate on orders of one of each size of the manual, and delivered them in five business days.Features I would like to see in addition to a correction of the major complaints mentioned above:  a lens cap that pops off when you turn on the camera and the lens extends, like my previous camera offered; an on-screen battery status indicator that A.) doesn't start flashing CONTINUALLY onscreen once you get down to 25% battery power, ceasing only when battery is depleted (another REALLY annoying feature of this camera!), and B.) tells how many minutes or shots remain on the battery charge rather than simply depicting a very gross and generalized full / empty battery symbol that all-too-quickly goes into flash alert mode (see A., preceding!).So . . . after all these complaints, why do I like this camera?  Well, to summarize: with every camera there are trade-offs, and in this case the Pros outweighed the Cons (albeit sometimes barely!), to wit:  the image quality - color, saturation, accuracy, sharpness -- is excellent (reducing significantly post-production tweaking); it shoots RAW as well as JPEG; it shoots fast AND consistently; the zoom is awesome IF you can get a handle on how to use it sans tripod with minimal camera shake (i.e., brace, don't breathe, tuck elbows into sides, and use the EVF, painful as the latter may be); its menu system doesn't drive you crazy; the Intelligent Auto results are mind-bendingly good; the camera is very flexible and it has many very useful features and settings that I have not enumerated here.  Of those, a fine feature I should mention is that the EVF has a rubberized surround so that glasses-wearers like myself won't scratch the daylights out of their spectacle lenses when using it (a big problem with almost all EVFs that I have learned the hard way) -- no present competitor of which I am aware has this thoughtful feature, and it's a major entry in the \"Pro\" column!  In addition, the camera's weight at 21.5 ozs. (loaded) and its reasonably compact size are well-suited to my purposes, and the price point is low -- ALTHOUGH I would HAPPILY pay $100 more if Canon would correct all the design flaws I have described above, because those corrections would result in as near-perfect a bridge super-zoom as I can conceive of at the moment!Addendum:  it turns out that Canon has had to recall a number of these cameras due to a defect in the composition of the aforementioned (and much-touted by yours truly) rubberized EVF surround - apparently over time, affected surrounds will become whitish in color and flake off small particles that can irritate the eye!  My camera happens to be one so affected, and must be returned to the factory for replacement of the surround.  Canon will pay all expenses, of course, but how long will you be without your camera?!  Talk about an inconvenience!  I mention this because I strongly suggest that if you decide to purchase this camera, make sure the serial number is not on the recall list.Conclusion:  recommended, but with some reservations.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Impressive \"Little\" Camera", "Author": "dlv \"Debbie\"", "ReviewID": "R3JKEWXOFONCZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am the owner of many a Nikon  (Coolpix, D90, D7000, and D5200).

I was researching on line and was looking at the Nikon Coolpix P520 and read a review about the P520 that mentioned that the SX50 HS was superior.  I went to web sites that compared the two and the Canon PowerShot SX50 HS was rated much higher and had better reviews - so I cheated on my NIkons and purchased this Canon.  I can't give it 5 stars because I compare its functions and build with my dSLRs - which are much more flexible, more solid, etc. than this Canon - However, it is fast and takes great photos outside (I don't really care for the inside w/ a flash shots - but that is because I usually use external flashes with my dSLRs inside and the quality is just much better).  I like that this has a viewfinder as well as an LCD swivel screen.  I do not like taking pictures via a LCD screen unless I have too (sometimes it is nice - for instance when shooting video).  The video quality of this camera is great.  It has a very good 50x Optical Zoom (I seldom use a digital zoom - the quality stinks).  I have taken quite a few shots with this camera out the full 50x and have been impressed with the shots even without a tripod.  I wish the camera more than a quick manual in hard copy.  It really just helps you set the camera up.  The full manual is on the CD inside the box -which I have not looked at yet.  So - all in all - I am very pleased with this camera which is very reasonably priced.  It is well worth the price it sells for.  I would recommend it to those not looking for a dSLR but wanting a camera that does more than a point and shoot and that  has a good optical zoom.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Worthwhile Upgrade From an SX1", "Author": "Arnold A.

Here's the difference.Pros (Where SX50 is better than the SX1)Better images. Outdoors the SX1 takes great shots under the perfect light conditions, the SX50 takes better shots under less perfect conditions.SX50 has more intuitive settings compared to the SX1. For example, in order to record HD videos in the SX1, you have to change the aspect ratio of the photo settings from 4:3 to widescreen. In the SX50, the video resolution and photo aspect ratio are independent of one another.Better image stabilization.Better LCD screen and EVF.Higher resolution shots. (12 MP vs 10MP).Longer zoom (50x vs 20x)Better low light shots. I had to buy and use a Canon Speedlight 270 EX to improve my night and indoor shots).More solid build.Lighter weight.Pros (found on both cameras)Ability to save images in RAW format. Only the SX1 and the SX50 could save in RAW. The rest, SX20, SX40, etc. could not do.Cons (Where SX1 was better than SX50)No remote control. The SX1 had a very useful remote that you can use to take shots with.No longer uses AA batteries. The AA batteries gave me a lot o flexibility should I run out of juice. I can simply go to any store, buy batteries and continue taking shots. Now I need to buy an extra battery for the SX50 (shop where I bought it ran out of batteries). At least I can use my AA Eneloop batteries for other uses like on my flash and on my wireless mouse.No lens hood, no USB cable, no AV cables included. In the SX1 box, all of these accessories were included. All you have in the box is the camera, battery, charger, CDs and manuals.With the exception of the remote, all the cons of the SX50 can easily be offset by buying the things that you want (lens hood, cables, etc.). And the features far outweigh the loss of the remote.

More recently mostly DSLR's. I primarily use a Canon T3i for pictures and video. I recently decided that I would like to purchase a camera capable of capturing great video with the ability to self focus, I did not want to upgrade to the t4i as my t3i is still fairly new. I did a lot of research on this camera and thought I would give it a try. I love that the camera has the option to shoot in Raw, this will be a great feature for anyone trying change from point and shoot to DSLR, Raw files are much easier to work with and edit. The flash is clunky on this camera and the flash button on the side is useless until you manually raise the flash, you would think that pressing the button would automatically raise the flash, but this is not the case. Indoor shooting in low light is at the very low end of sub par, and a little over exposed when the flash is on. Moving subjects are blurry indoors and there quite a bit of noise in the pictures. It does however produce very incredible almost DSLR quality pictures with good lighting.On to indoor video, the main reason for the purchase. Low light video looks incredible while you are recording and looking at the tiny LCD you believe you are capturing nothing short of a masterpiece HD video, until you watch it on a larger screen and notice the all the grainy blur. I suspect the reason for this is the low aperture range which does not allow for much light to enter the camera. When you are panned all the way out this is not such an issue, but begin to zoom in on a subject and they become very dark. I will be returning this and purchasing a actual camcorder since that was the main reason for the purchase, I just really hoped this would eliminate having to take 2 separate cameras and a bunch of lenses when I travel, I believe Canon is getting closer to bridging the two, but there is still a long way to go. This is not a bad camera, but simply does not meet my needs. I believe if you are primarily going to use this product outside on well lit days you will be pleased, but if your trying to capture low light images or video you need to look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Bridge Camera that's Better Than Point-and-Shoot Cameras Yet Not Quite a DSLR", "Author": "MidtownRunner", "ReviewID": "R2J3EWRVQAFS9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an amateur who has long been curious to learn more about photography.  I bought this particular camera for two reasons: (1) to help promote organizations of which I'm a member by taking photos of our events, often in low-light conditions and (2) to teach myself more advanced photography through its manual controls, such as ISO, aperture, and shutter speed.Surprises:Although the zoom certainly seemed nice when I bought the camera, I had not realized how useful its 50x zoom would be.  (With digital enhancement, the zoom can reach 200x, but with heavy digital zoom, the image quality suffers.)  I can sit in the rafters of a sporting or singing event and easily photograph the faces of the performers across a crowded gym or auditorium from me.  As long as the images are with the optical zoom, they are good enough quality to be used in a newsletter or on Facebook.  The zoom has also been useful to photograph wildlife.  For example, I went to a lake, and while there, I was able to isolate ducks as they swam and even when they reached land.  I also was able to be closer to the ducks without causing them to alter their routine.  I've since learned through research that obtaining equivalent zoom functionality with a DSLR would require lenses that could cost 3-4 times as much as this camera.Various reviews, particularly on professional websites, had commented that a tripod was necessary to capture the benefits of the SX50's zoom, and I now agree.  At 50x zoom, very small movements of the camera can cause you to go from watching a bird in a tree to staring a random, out-of-focus leaf on another tree.  A tripod usefully reduces such opportunities for human error.I was also pleasantly surprised by the self-timer.  It's not a reason to buy this particular camera, but I had not realized how useful self-timing 3 shots in a row would be, especially when I'm gathering the family for a photo on the sofa.Pros:So many of these reviews have \"Pros\" and \"Cons,\" and my thoughts won't differ from those to any great extent.  The biggest pro is that this is essentially a very advanced point-and-shoot camera that gives you customization options akin to a true DSLR.  In this way, it is a \"bridge\" between the two camera categories, but you may alternatively encounter \"superzoom\" as describing its category in professional reviews.  The photo quality is solid and the auto focus is adequate.  Unlike other point-and-shoot controls that I've encountered, the on-screen controls treat you like an adult,  In fact, the scroll wheel and function button are quite easy to manipulate while staring at the image through the viewfinder.Cons:The biggest con is that this is not a DSLR camera -- though it's still a very good camera.  The auto focus and shutter speed can be slower than ideal when I'm trying to photograph a speaker using Auto mode, but when I switch to the Sports mode and take bursts of photos, I'm often able to capture the images that I strive for.  When I read reviews, a line like that will sometimes cause me to pause and over zealously think \"Oh no, I need a camera that has a faster or better X feature!\"  Still, provided that you aren't trying to be a professional photographer at a college football game, it's pretty good functionality.Various reviews state that the viewfinder is inadequate, and I agree that the viewfinder is subpar, especially when compared to the SX50's beautiful optical screen.  Nonetheless, as a practical matter, the weak viewfinder does not cause me to take bad photographs.  That is, when I photograph an object by viewing it through the viewfinder, I tend to believe that the image has some flaw in it, but often, when I look at the photograph on a computer or through the screen, the image looks quite good despite the sometimes unclear quality displayed in the viewfinder.  I credit the auto focus with making me come across as a better photographer than I actually am.Fulfilling My Motivations to Purchase:Earlier, I mentioned my two primary motivations to purchase.  As to photographing events, the camera does so well.  I've even discovered that the zoom, particularly at a setting like 75mm-100mm equivalent, has a nice effect of flattening the image and improving the appearance of the subjects (though that's not a phenomenon unique to this camera).  In low light, the camera distinguishes itself from a typical point-and-shoot camera.  Again, it's not going to create miracles and I've seen DSLRs do better, but for an amateur photographer like me using it for promotion of my organizations and family photos, I'm satisfied with the results.As to teaching me more about photography, it really is a fun camera to use because it has a serious side that treats me like an adult.  I've gone the EasyShare route with two cameras that used icons to suggest particular functionality, and the Canon SX50 has similar icons for preprogrammed functionality without being limited to those.  I really like how the camera has hands-on features that let me bypass those preprogrammed settings.  In particular, I have experimented with ISO and shutter speed settings.  The scroll wheel in combination with the menu screens is fairly intuitive to use.  As a result, I have a much better understanding of digital photography than before I bought the camera.Conclusion:In reviewing, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between my own ineffectiveness with photography and true limitations with the camera.  Nonetheless, it's clear that this is a good camera that satisfies my needs, and I'm able to take better photographs than friends who have DSLRs but don't know how to use them.  When I some day buy a new camera, it must, at a minimum, have the functionality present in this camera.  More likely, I will purchase a DSLR and will research that purchase based on what I have learned from using the SX 50 during my ownership of it.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "kbart", "ReviewID": "RBRF5RJQ8TQDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift prior to excursion to Peru and Bolivia where I took 1500 pictures and videos.

So I just want to add my personal likes and dislikes about this camera since buying it about a month ago. I have previously owned the Canon S2 and the SX20, and have used and abused them well in my travels. Furthermore, I've made some great photos and videos with these cameras, and have created several good quality DVDs and Blu-rays of my travels). With the promised better low light shooting and the greater zoom that the SX50 has to offer, I jumped at the upgrade. I'm glad so far that I did.Likes: \"It's the zoom, stupid!\" No seriously, I love to zoom in on wildlife and people from a distance. I travel a lot and this allows me to take photos of people without the need to ask first (and thereby not get a posed shot). The 50 times zoom works really well and quite frankly is astonishing.I like the larger LCD screen. It frames the 4:3 aspect photos a lot better. I have always loved and used the articulation feature of the screen.I mostly shoot in Manual mode, but I love playing with the HDR (High Dynamic Range imaging. This effect shoots three exposures and combines them to produce a tone-mapped effect with color effect options including Sepia, Black and White an Super vivid colors). I've taken some really nice shots with this, although at lower light situations it's best to have a tripod (which I plan on buying soon).Shooting in low light situations. I have gotten some pretty good shots with hardly any noise at both 800 and 1600 ISO. Far better than earlier versions of this Canon zoom. (Yes, I know: the Panasonic is better at this. But the Panny is about a couple hundred bucks more.)The High Speed Burst HQ  (accessed via the \"SCN\" preset menu) is pretty cool, shooting up to ten frames at, I believe, 13fps.I'm ok without having the 4 x AA batteries. The SX50 is significantly lighter than the SX20 because of the use of a propriety Li-ion battery instead of the AAs. Sure the battery life is not so hot, but I bought 2 extra Li-ions from non-Canon manufactures at about 9 bucks each.I am pleased with the speed of the auto focus. It did not take long to focus on and shoot some wildlife, all of which can easily and quickly slip away. Shoots well through windows.I love the electronic level. My horizons are no longer tilted.Dislikes: \"It's the zoom, stupid!\" The lens will not allow much \"depth of field\" in your photos. This is a huge dislike, although I can manipulate photos in editing software.I don't like the viewfinder. Hard to frame anything using it. This definitely keeps me from giving the SX50 a 5 star rating.The super slow motion feature is at a high frame rate (240 frames per second), but at a very low quality. You can't really use it in making your DVDs or Blurays (at least I haven't found a way yet). I guess you can just use it for a playback on the camera's LCD. The quicker slow motion has better quality, though still not HD.Panning while shooting the high quality HD video is horrible. It created a very choppy looking video I took of the ocean. I will have to test to see if the lower quality setting (which the SX20 has--which panned nicely) is any better. Update: the panning of stationary scenes is fine with the high quality setting.Although the SX50 has the ability to shoot in RAW format, I have not seen the need for it. As I progress in my understanding of how to use it with post processing software, it might be useful. For now, I am happy with the JPEGs I get.The build of the strap holders does not allow for attaching a different strap. I had a camera harness (useful while hiking or biking) that cannot attach because they made the holders--if that's the term--too far into the camera body. In the SX20, the holders stick out.The quality of the camera's build feels cheaper. They used a plastic which, although lighter, feels and looks cheaper. I am however, getting used to it.Final thoughts:  I am reading more photography books to learn how to more effectively utilize the impressive features of the SX50, such as HDR. I am looking forward to taking it up with me backpacking in Yosemite this summer, and South East Asia next winter. I also hope it will be more useful in capturing low light photos of my 6th grade students working inside the classroom. Though not perfect, and with the lens not having a low aperture--so a lack of depth of field, it feels so far like a good upgrade from the SX20.

Didn't take bad pix, but it would not capture the scene like I remembered it and my daughter's first homecoming was quickly approaching. I decided I would begin researching a DSLR. Unfortunately that turned out to be much more expensive than my budget could handle so I researched the bridge cameras as well as used/refurbished DSLRs. I never looked at this camera until I walked into a local camera store. What I learned there was that older DSLR camera are lacking in video camera, on-screen display, and long zoom in the price range of sub $500.After testing this camera, I was hooked and bought it (locally). I began playing with it prior to homecoming so I could get used to it and found it to be very easy to use. Here is my amateur review of the camera.Viewfinder vs screenFor the most part I use the viewfinder. I like it for 3 reasons: 1) It eliminates everything else from view, 2) In college I had trained my self to use a microscope without closing one eye so I could switch concentration from my right to left eye. The advantage to this is that I could get the entire view of the scene then switch back to see what the camera is seeing, and 3) the battery lasts longer. I occasionally use the screen when I need to hold the camera over others to take a picture. The view finder is nothing special IMO, but it does its job nicely.Picture qualityI took picture at homecoming that people loved. I would like to say that it was me, but it wasn't. The camera takes great pictures. My daughter met a bunch of her friends for pictures. I took the normal posed pictures like everyone else, but the ones she liked the most were the ones when I stood in the distance and took pictures she didn't know I was taking. Photos like her talking to friends, another while she was talking on the phone to her boyfriend's dad, another when Mom was helping her with a tag that was sticking out, and when her boyfriend's grandmother helping her to put on the corsage. The way this camera isolates the view is awesome, but I was also taking advantage of what I learned here [...] Standing back from her while zooming in allowed me to take a picture that emphasized what I wanted it to. Also, it is able to take quick pictures so I could take the picture at the moment when people moved and allowed me to get the shot. Recently, I was at a ceremony where my son was talking and I wanted to get a good shot, but he was shaded so it made the background much brighter while he was dark. To adjust I would have the camera focus on the area around his feet which brightened the foreground and I could then take a good picture of him. I know pros would find this a hack method, but it was a fast adjustment and worked well.FunctionsI haven't used the camera long enough to learn all of the functions, but I really like to turn on the on-screen meters, which also shows in the view finder. I am learning more about the fstop and others just by watching this. The level showed me that I have a tendency to tilt to one side because of my nose :). In playing with it I programmed a setting which later made recording appear to pink. I thought the camera was broken until I finally saw that I was using a user-programmed setting. I turned off the feature and everything was fine again. I also realized that I only needed to press the dedicated button for recording. The zoom is incredible. I have taken the standard pictures showing craters on the moon, but also pictures of people on a golf course near my house. After taking it I had look a bit to see where I actually was zoomed.ErgonomicsThe camera fits well into my hands, but I bet it would also fit into smaller hands (I am 6'2\"). The neck-strap is short when hanging around my neck. The viewfinder is very easy to use, although my nose gets in the way a bit. The flash conveniently has bumps on the side which allows me to quickly flip it up with a finger without moving my hands. I don't use the buttons around the lens and I have to be careful not to hit them. Although they have functionality that I have not explored since they are not operational in auto mode. The function wheel is something I still need to get used to, but it works and it helps that I can turn it or tap.In all, I rate this excellent for my needs and I would recommend it.

First off let me tell you that I own the SX40 and LOVE it. The picture quality on the Canon cameras are the best IMHO. I have owned several Kodak, Nikon and Minolta cameras. I have rested on the Canon brand because the pics I take with these cameras need little or no post edit fixes.I had the SX40 for about one year and honestly thought I would never need another camera. I decided to purchase the SX50 to see if it could out do the SX40...if not, I would return the SX50.It was a VERY difficult choice but I ended up keeping the SX50 and selling the SX40 on Ebay.The deciding factors and tough choices I made were all about the lens and autofocus.SX40:LENS- f/2.7-f/5.8 35x optical zoomSX50:LENS- f/3.4-f/6.5 50x optical zoomThe 35x optical zoom was fine for the type of pics I take. I did not really think that I needed a 50x zoom but I have to say, the zoom on the SX50 is amazing. You can still get good hand held shots at full zoom in good light. Tripod would be needed for either in low light. What I did not like was the loss of the f/2.7. After playing with both I decided that for the travel/night shots that I take....I would need a tripod for either the f/2.7 or the f/3.4 in low light so I felt OK about giving up the wider aperture of the SX40. If you consistently need a fast shutter that goes with a wider aperture...you may want to keep your SX40.AUTOFOCUS: The autofocus on the SX50 is faster than the SX40. It is enough faster that I really noticed the difference in side by side shooting situations. The SX50 is a significant improvement in that area.MISC: I only went over the factors that went in to my decision. For others the deciding factors may be that the SX50 shoots in RAW and JPEG...not a huge deal for me. Or that the SX50 has a few more bells and whistles such as HDR preset. I always had my C1 set for HDR on the SX40 so not a big deal either.What I HATE about both:Many other reviewers reported that they did not like the program presets in either the SX40 or SX50. I am in agreement there. Especially the fact that if you are shooting on manual and choose a shutter speed of 1\" or greater, the ISO is fixed at 100 for the SX40 and ISO 80 for the SX50. I hate that about both....I get around that with the CHDK hack. I know it may sound intimidating but it is not. If you go to you tube, you will get step by step instructions on how to do this for you Canon cameras. It does not hack your camera, it hacks the SD card so you can override the camera presets. The camera hardware is not changed. I do that so I can be fully manual and set the ISO,aperture, shutter speed to MY liking, not the camera's program.I travel all over the world and like to travel light...that is why I insist on a good 'bridge' camera. I do not want to pack extra lenses and equipment. I am not a professional photographer but I have won some photo contests and I quite often blow the photos up to 20 x 30 or 16 x 20...either of these cameras are superb for that. So in conclusion, I decided that giving up the 'faster' lens (aperture)on the SX40 was worth it for the faster autofocus and larger zoom of the SX50.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Birders best affordable", "Author": "Edith's mom \"Karen\"", "ReviewID": "R19JG8M4EX8A77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this for my husband, a novice birder because he has been frustrated with the camera he was using.

Image stabilization is very impressive - one can even take the 50x shots handheld.  Macro is quite good.  Processing speed got much faster.

It adds bulk and price and delivers nothing.*Stop overwriting the manual settings.  Let the photographer make mistakes and learn from them.*Unzooming to find the subject with one click of a button should be done much wider*Make thread for the lens without the adapter.*Articulated display should stay in the next model (g15 was a huge disappointment compared to g12 because the lack of articulated display).  It should have a 1000k+ pixels, as opposed to the pathetic 400k+ pixels that the current model has.*Canon - consider making this camera with a little bit larger sensor (maybe call it a differnt model).  I know, the lens would have to increase in size, but having the capability to increase the ISO above 100 and not loose quality is very important.*I would like to see image stabilization even better at large zoom and at macro.* Keep the buttons where they were on the previous model.

Gellman", "ReviewID": "R2F2RFK3QSFFBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon sx40hs last year, and was very pleased with the image quality. However, I was frustrated by the auto focus, which would tend to be sluggish at times, and lost at others. Also, the resolution of the lcd screen was relatively low.  So, I purchased the Sony hx200v, another prime contender in the superzoom class, because of its good reviews about the speed and accuracy of its auto focus, as well as its super high resolution screen. I was disappointed, however, despite the Sony's superiority in these areas, along with its gps for geotagging that the Canon doesn't have, because the image quality of the Sony wasn't nearly as good as the Canon! Even though the Sony has 18 megapixles compared to 12 on the same size sensor on the Canon, this is the Achilles heel of the hx200v. There is much more detail in the pictures from the Canon than the Sony, due to the detrimental effects of the  aggressive noise reduction necessary for Sony's pixel packed chip. There was too much smudging of details in the Sony's pictures, even at low ISO. Very disappointed! So, after selling the Canon sx40hs to buy the Sony hx200v, I have settled on the Canon sx50hs, and I'm very happy with this improved Canon superzoom. The 50x optical zoom is unsurpassed in its class, the autofocus is significantly better than its predecessor, and the screen resolution is higher now, too. Plus, it shoots in RAW format, in addition to jpeg, and has HDR as well. And the image quality is beautiful, much better than the Sony, which unfortunately, due to all those pixels on such a small chip, tend to look smudgy, flat and fake. More is definitely less in this instance. Canon uses the Digic 5 image processor in this camera, the same chip they put in their high end dslrs. Benefit from my experience here, and get the Canon sx50hs!

I called to say i did not want a refurbished camera given that i'd already had problems with two of this model.  Too bad they said, you're getting refurbished.  I asked to talk to customer relations. Got a lady who told me it was in the warranty they could give me refurbished and furthermore they had no new ones to give--this is the CAnon facility mind you.  I called back to try to talk to another rep--was told they couldln't transfer me. Then, when i said i was recording it, and told him i had been transferred last time, suddenly he now could transfer me. Back to initial rep who refused to let me talk to anyone else and refused to budge on sending a new camera, even though it was an option in the email. I wrote letters and emails to management.

I spent way too long looking at reviews and debates and decided all I was doing was confusing myself.  I considered other long zoom small sensor cameras as well.  Panasonic, Nikon, Sony and Fuji all make fine cameras as well as others.  But this one seemed to fit my wants well.  The FZ200 almost won out with its constant 2.8 aperture lens.  However, the 50x lens that the canon has gave it the edge.  And to be honest, even though the sx50 may need to boost iso's up to accommodate for the long zoom, it handles the noise well enough.  I also like the rotating screen and the big list of functions this camera has.  I learned from others reviewers to use the shutter priority more often.  I like to photograph birds and kids and this works better with a faster shutter than a camera may apply when shooting in auto.  You may have to raise the iso's into the 400 range but you will still get a clearer shot.  The only small complaint I have is the slick feel the sx50 has.  Others, like the Fuji have a rubbery grip that feels wonderful and secure.  I am wondering if I can apply some sort of applique or thin coat of rubber-like paint to key areas to help in this regard.  Canon should address this in the future with their larger zoom cameras.  As for the dslr, I'm sure I could never afford the zoom lens needed to reach the lengths the sx50 can.  I may still purchase an entry level one just to try out and have on hand for portrait or low light situations.  But for now I will enjoy this fun, quality built camera.

I'm just someone who wanted a better than standard camera that would be able to take decent photos in all sorts of situations without having to switch out parts and accessories or even if the guy behind the lens has no idea what he's doing.If this sounds like you, let me tell ya...This camera doesn't disappoint. Not even a little.My first impulse when shopping around was to buy a DLSR and a couple of lenses. Once the initial sticker shock of just how much that was going to cost me subsided, I set my sights on what's commonly referred to as a \"Bridge\" camera.I spent a good hour or two picking over mid-range cameras at the local big box store before finally settling on this one. My reasoning behind this over a similarly equipped Nikon was purely aesthetic. The Canon felt better in my hand and the controls were laid out in a fashion I was used to with other digital gadgets I've owned in the past. A few moments later on Amazon.com and it was on it's way to me.I told myself I'd spend a day or two when it arrived to play around with the settings and features, but like everything else life tends to get in the way of the best laid plans. So without ever even having read the instructions, I took the camera with me on a trip to Germany. And shockingly enough, I managed to get some amazing photos! The camera itself is extremely intuitive in it's own \"AUTO\" mode, and I only switched it out of that mode when I wanted to try using some of the other features for really close or exceptionally far away shots. Honestly, AUTO mode will probably satisfy 90% of what the amateur photographer needs.Speaking of the zoom feature...HOLY COW! I was taking some landscape shots and saw something off in the distance...a few seconds later and I was zoomed in so close I could read the signage on a building nearly a mile away, and pick out the individual rocks in a stream at the bottom of a very deep ravine. Not only that, but once you snapped the photo, you still had enough clarity through the anti shake feature to produce a decent photo.

But I did find the camera a little less than fully intuitive to operate. But once learned, the little beast has an awful lot to recommend it. In fully auto mode, the camera selects among the preprogrammed modes pretty much flawlessly, and the lens (and hence image quality) is remarkably fine for such a low price.  In fact, a colleague with an extremely expensive Canon SLR was a little miffed that my image quality rivaled what he could achieve with an $1200 telephoto lens.BTW, Amazon price was substantially better than my local camera shops. My local guy was pretty shocked in fact, saying that the Amazon consumer price was better than what he was buying the camera for at wholesale.Only down side is that the image stabilization features are a little awkward to use at first.

We are talking about a camera that slightly zoomed in at approx. 30 feet away, took a picture of a door handle and the lights were off in the room where the door handle was, the picture came out as if the lights were on and the detail and quality of the picture is just amazing!

If you so much as touch the control nob on the right back of the camera you can accidentally change every setting, including starting the timed shutter. It would be nice if Canon make this much less sensitive.  Forget speedy multiple picture taking in the single shot mode. Yep, if you think in advance you can set to multiple exposures but don't assume the camera stops being \"busy\" (and cannot shoot) anywhere near what a DSLR Canon can do, or even the GS12.  Be careful not to review pictures when you are trying to act with some speed. You cannot switch from reviewing prior shots to taking a new picture in less than four or five seconds. The camera does not switch quickly.  ISO at 3200 is a nice addition but it takes terrible pictures. I use Photoshop Lightroom 4 which has a pretty good noise reduction function, but it cannot fix the noise at 3200 without blurring the pictures. Even ISO 1600 is a push to fix in Lightroom. I'd call images at these ISO speeds borderline unacceptable.  The camera could really, really use a manual or complete quick start guide.

All are DSLR except this tiny SX50 monster. Mostly I use it for shooting my kids when they perform (like violin, not very quick dance) on stage or play sports games (like baseball, not very quick running). As long as they are not in quick motions (like running and jumping), I can take very decent photos from a very far distance (about 30 to 120 feet even more, for example, from the very far end of a 3000-seat theater). Even indoor and with normally low stage light, I can take very good photos. Three things I want to share are 1) when you zoom it in near the far end, the long focal length will generate more beautiful pictures with clear background,i.e. bokeh, and 2) the image-stabilizer feature of this camera can help you produce a sharp photo at the 50x end even at a slow shutter speed of 20 without using tripod (of course you need practice); 3) you can take video with it and press shutter button to take photo anytime without stopping the video, which is amazing.You may wonder how good those photos I took are. Let me give you an example. My friend (John) and I went to a concert last week, we both brought cameras to take photos for our kids. He carried his Nikon D7100 with 70-200mm f/2.8 lens (total cost over $3000), and I carried my tiny sx50 (cost over $300, 10th of John's) leaving all my DSLRs at home. John laughed at me, ' is that a toy?' , I said, 'yes'.  Then from the end of the small theater, I took photo for my son and he did for his daughter (of course his 200mm not that long enough, he had to crop his photos).  When we share the results next day, I laughed and he was amazed, by my photos, not by his.  Of course, if we can get close to the stage, I won't compete with him, I know 70-200mm f/2.8 is perfect for that (especially with a full frame body that allows higher ISO and speed).Although many other features have no use for me, I give it 5 star, for the feature I like.The only thing I want to warn you is that you can not adjust the focus completely by manual even there is a manual mode on SX50, seems the camera doesn't trust you, it always does something for you, which is funny, and annoying.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "\"QUICK SHOT\" Canon", "Author": "LT4CE", "ReviewID": "R2ERO7S46MWD2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in May 2013 and have been taking great shots of birds and other animals using our bird feeder (opossums, skunks, deer, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, etc.) with great results for wide angle to full zoom.

We also visited Columbia, Guatemala, and Mexico, generally via bus excursions.This is where the SX50 shined.  I took several snapshots thru the bus window, as the bus was moving, thinking there was no way for the camera to be able to focus that fast.  I took both video and still shots - almost all came out as if I had spent time to focus and frame the picture first.  Most were taken as I moved the camera from my lap to the window, and without pausing, snapping the picture!  In several of these I snapped down side streets as the bus was moving slowly (30 mph).

I had researched a wide array of digital cameras including the panasonic fz70, the fz200 (which based on what I read, might be better all around, but there's a reason I went after this one, and I'll get to that), and the nikon p520.  I ultimately settled on the sx50 because I did want to play with the high end zoom after seeing sample shots and because I love the canon interface.  This is a very user friendly camera and unless you want to get professional, dslr style photographs out of it, you won't be disappointed.In terms of picture quality, if you're shooting outdoors, the pics you can get out of this camera are pretty good.  I took the camera with me on a hiking trip and was able to shoot some object far away using the zoom, like an airplane flying overhead, or a tiny insect crawling through some trees.  It does some neat work.  The other wow on this camera are shots you can do at night of the moon.  Pair up the 50x optical with digital zoom and you can get some fantastic shots!In terms of your day to day photography, the camera is decent enough.  It struggles a little bit in low light.  If you're doing pictures for the web or internet, low light photographs are actually pretty good.  Canon's digic5 processing system probably has something to do with this, boasting an ISO up to 6400.  What I like about night photos on here is that color wise, they look true to what you're seeing in the night without use of the flash.  The only downside is that they are noisy unless you are doing a long exposure at a low ISO.  Still, for the price and all the features, it looks nice.The other fun part about this camera is the array of filters you can use.  Alot of the filters are things found in standard free photo software for phones, but they work well here.  One of the fun filters is color swap or only using one color and placing the rest of the photo in black and white.  The cool thing is you can use a lot of these filters while shooting.  I also particularly like the super vivid option on the canons.  The pics really come out, especially outdoors.There's also a lot I haven't played with yet on this camera, including the in camera HDR and the video.  And this is probably the one thing I really don't like about the camera - and it's not entirely a bad thing.  This camera is not a DSLR and will not give you DSLR quality.  But Canon put in a lot of the adjustment features you traditionally find on their rebels.  You will get a tad frustrated when you find what the settings can do and youll be a tad disappointed when you realize you can't get those proshots.  For someone wanting to have fun and learn how to manually adjust the camera a little more, this is a great bridge camera.  But if you're wanting to jump right into taking professional shots with this camera, remember - it's a point and shoot.  It's a really good one, mind you, but that's still what it is.  It is definitely worth the value.

It was time for an upgrade! After extensive research online and recommendations from friends we decided to go with the SX50. We wanted something that had the ability to be customized as I learned more about photography and would be similar to a DSLR yet we also wanted to be able to just \"point and shoot\" until I got the hang of it all. I enjoy taking photos but I really have no idea what a lot of the terminology is yet. The idea of getting a DSLR was really intimidating, plus the cost difference was pretty substantial if we were going to go with the \"best\" beginner DSLR out there. The SX50 offered the chance for me to learn more while still have an automatic setting that could take all the guess work out of it for me. Less than a week after we got the camera we went to a friend's wedding. The 4 hour plane ride to get there allowed me some time to play around with all the settings and trying to learn some tricks to get good pictures at the wedding. At the wedding though, I wasn't comfortable enough to actually use any of the settings so I took nearly all of the photos on the auto setting. It actually worked out ok because the auto setting took GREAT pics! Since we've been home I've gotten the chance to mess around with the settings a little bit more and I'm slowly starting to get more comfortable with them and what they do. I'm really happy that I'm able to do that. Other features about the camera that we really like are the 50x zoom. I had no idea how far that really is until I was taking pictures from my couch of a squirrel outside in a tree-I got so close that it looked like he was sitting right next to me! We also really like the screen and the way it can be folding back to protect it. Another camera we were thinking of getting was the Nikon P510 but we really disliked how the screen on that one moved. With the Canon we can put the screen facing in to protect it from being damaged when we aren't using it and that is a huge plus-the last thing I want to worry about is breaking the screen because we couldn't protect it.Overall, we really like this camera and are really happy we got it. We've yet to do a lot of picture taking since Spring has taken a while to show up and we haven't been outdoors a lot yet.

King", "ReviewID": "R1I5ZKQKGGFWF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are good reviews here from knowledgeable photographers. Mine's from the simpler view of what this camera is like for a Point & Shooter.  I can't even call myself an amateur photographer and know nothing about ISO and such. I wanted a camera with a great zoom that would take quality pictures, but that was pretty simple and fast since my subjects are likely not going to sit still while I fiddle with controls.  My father loved photography and developed his own pictures back in the day, but he was never able to teach my mother the fine points so I spent half my childhood posing for lengthy sessions while she struggled with f stops, focus and lighting.  My grandchildren are used to quick camera phones and aren't going to be sitting still for me doing the same.  My camera has to be fast, smart, easy and reliable.Since I live in the country I especially enjoy nature photography, but the wild turkeys refuse to come close enough for me to get decent pictures of them, the little birds seldom pose for long and the deer and other creatures are pretty jittery subjects.  I needed a really good zoom, auto focus, multiple shots with one press of the button sometimes, an easy way to go from movies to still shots and a fast way to access different functions.  This camera does the best job of the three I've tried and I like it, but there are a couple of issues too.It does not come with a cable to plug it into your computer.  If you have a newer computer you may have slots to insert the camera's SD card instead of plugging the camera into a USB port to remove the pictures, BUT if you want the software and user guide installed, you have to plug in the camera.  Hummm.  Luckily I have a smaller PowerShot camera and already had a cable with a mini connector that would work (there's also a slot for a wider flater connector), but I'd have been pretty annoyed if I didn't.  The second downside for me is that I'd really like to try the software, but can't get it.  The software is not on the CD like I expected.  The CD just starts the installation process and determines what model camera this is.  It then downloads the software from the internet (without telling you that's what it's going to do).  This may not be a problem for some users, but for those of us out in the sticks with poor internet access and maybe a data limit to boot, this is a huge problem.  After two tries and nearly 1 GB of data (which pushed me so close to my limit I can't do much of anything further till my cycle rolls over), I was able to get only the Image Browser which is not for extracting the pictures from the camera, but for organizing the pictures in your MyPictures folder.  I totally don't care about that and can't believe I wasted 1 GB  and two hours to get it.  Nothing tells you what the various software components are or how big the files are.Windows is happy to download my pictures and videos just like it does with my phone, but since I was unable to get the other items listed in the software download, I don't know what I may be missing.  I manually searched the CD and found the pdf file for the User Guide in the folder 'ReadMe', subfolder 'en' for English. Once you've started the 'easy' installation process for the software, you can't choose just to install the user guide, so I don't know how else you're going to get it but this manual method. I recommend choosing the 'custom' installation where I assume you could choose to get the User Guide installed first and then later decide if you want the other components.  The installation screen tells you almost nothing useful. Very dumb--and in my book they lose a star for this whole hookup software thing.On to the camera itself: I'm quite satisfied and might be even more so after I read the User Guide and learn how to do some things that look interesting like setting up certain favored shooting modes to assign to custom setting buttons for quick use.  So far the only thing I've experimented with are the preprogrammed settings.  The zoom is really good and there are assists to help you keep your target in frame and focus on it.  I particularly like that there is a viewfinder as well as the large display that can be used several ways.  I sometimes find it easier to keep the camera steady by using the viewfinder, which allows me to steady the camera against my face.I like the dedicated movie button and ability to take a picture while also taking a video.  The ability to shoot multiple pictures is great, but doesn't ensure perfect focus on them all.  Still it gives you a better chance of getting a good shot during action.  The focus, by the way, is fast and accurate compared to the two other similar cameras I tried.  The FujiFilm and the Olympus were both slower at focusing and the Olympus was annoyingly loud as well.This flash must be raised manually.  If the camera thinks you need it a message on the screen will tell you to raise it, after which it will fire automatically as needed. I like the separate erase button that reduces the risk of accidental erasure when viewing photos.The camera is a bit heavier than the others and is the SLR style bulky shape, but is not as big as a true DSLR camera.  It is easy to hold and the various buttons are well placed.  The battery life is not as long as I would like and can run out in a day of active shooting.  Best to have a backup I think as recharging the battery takes a couple of hours.I'm impressed with picture quality overall.  On a bright day, a cardinal posed for several pictures about 50' away on my back fence.  I was able to zoom until he pretty much filled the frame and I could see every feather distinctly in the finished pictures blown up on my large computer monitor.  The shot of a gopher burrow entrance in my pasture 200' away shows each detailed blade of grass very clearly and if a gopher had stuck his head out I could have seen the pupils of his eyes perfectly.  Some inside flash pictures were excellent, surprisingly so, but the flash didn't seem to carry as far as my smaller PowerShot camera when the same scene was taken with both cameras and compared.  On the other hand if I zoomed to the further location and then took the picture, it turned out very well, so maybe some internal camera intelligence was involved.  User Guide will probably tell.Bottom line, this camera is a keeper.  It's simple enough for this Point & Shoot photographer while also offering extras that will broaden my options and enhance the resulting quality of my pictures--and I might be inspired to learn all about ISO, etc :).", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "1200mm Zoom!!!!!!!

The 50X zoom is incredible. You can get a lot of shots that are impossible with other point and shoot cameras. The quality at full zoom is excellent. You can get detailed pictures of objects that you normally couldn't with other point and shoot cameras. The image quality remains good even when you throw in the digital zoom although it starts to deteriorate after you get past 100x.A lot of users have complained that the SX50 does not take good pictures in low light. This is true to some degree.  When the camera is set in automatic mode it tends to take dark grainy pictures. It often sets a high ISO and a low shutter speed. This is a especially problematic if you are taking pictures of moving objects. I have found that if you set the camera on manual and adjust the settings to your liking you can take significantly better pictures than the auto mode. This however does not need to be done in better lighting situations as the cameras auto mode works much better than in low light ones.I do recommend that if you intend to use this camera indoors that you invest in an external flash that allows you to bounce the light off the ceiling to get better quality pictures.  Again if you are taking the pictures in an outdoor environment the camera performs wonderfully.  For those of you that are looking to take wildlife pics you wont be disapointed.  How else could you get great closeups of wildlife without having to move close enough to scare them off?I have had no problems with the speed of the zoom and the time it takes to focus on your target. Sometimes it requires you to take your hand off the button and let the camera refucus but that usually only happens in low light situations and at extreme zooms. I have also been able to take a number of close up macro style photos of various objects while blurring the background for that proffesional look.I had to drop off 1 star for the lack of quality of the auto mode in lower light situations but again you can remedy this with a flash or going into manual mode.

There are lots of choices out there, but when I got my more technically minded and camera savvy husband to check my top 5 choices (by way of what I thought I wanted and customer reviews), I gave him the parameters of - least customer complaints, maximum zoom, and stick with Canon if you can because I am already used to their symbols and menu navigation nuisances. He agreed with my top choice despite strong leanings towards Nikon. They will always be faster, but seriously, I'm not that picky. I will never be a professional photographer, but this camera could be used by one. I am still working on reading the manual for a bunch of presets I can make, but it is also totally possible to just set it on auto and use it.

I honestly could not justify spending well over $500 for a bridge camera, although the f2.8 aperture over the entire zoom was screaming for me to get it. The Canon SX50 was my second choice, mainly for its insane 50x zoom. I picked it up for $369. Low light shooting and long reach have always been big draws, along with photo quality for me as a wildlife enthusiast. Turns out that this camera isn't too bad in low light either, although the trade off is higher ISO and grainier shots. Sure, I've had several DSLR's and I carried large lenses around for years. I finally got tired of all that bulk and decided to accept the trade off in a smaller sensor and photo quality. I'm not a professional and don't require full sensor quality. I opted for the SX50 based on pretty darned good reviews and the crazy long reach of the lens. Based on the many test shots I've taken both indoors and out, I am very happy with the performance of this camera! I may not have the critical expectations of a professional reviewer, but I know what I like and this bridge camera satisfies. Photo quality is very good and the 50x (200x digital) reach is incredible! That reach will bring that bird or coyote in the distance up close and personal. Also, remember that any camera is only as good as the photographer. If you don't know how to use a camera to its full potential, don't blame the camera!

Cotton \"Chris Cotton\"", "ReviewID": "R2UGRFQMR4TUJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given this camera to test and then own via the amazon Vine programme.I used to be a photography buff in the age of the SLR's, buying ISO film and exchanging filters and lenses to ensure the correct photo was produced. One would then take the roll of film to the shop and a week later you would see if what you took turned out OK. With today's digital cameras all these issues have been taken out of the equation with the compact digital cameras. There are still constraints with most compacts I have used, which is compromise between picture quality, the ability to manually set the camera for creativity purposes and the ability to change lenses to allow great macro or zoom shots. I have had 3 very good quality Panasonic Lumix cameras, the last being a TZ30. Whilst these compacts were good, they did not serve all the purposes I wanted in a camera.The Canon SX50 is not a compact camera and it is not a DSLR, but it is something in between. It is small and compact compared to a DSLR but has so many features included in it, you would think you are using a DSLR. The biggest difference is that this camera does not have inter changeable lenses, it comes with a magnificent 50X zoom, 4.3-215.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM canon wide angle lens. Having chosen Panasonic cameras in the past because they use a leica lens, all I can say is this lens is every bit as good in terms of picture quality as anything Panasonic can produce. The zoom is breathtaking in its clarity at 50X zoom. The zoom itself is very quiet and fast. The camera also has a 100X digital zoom which does not compromise the picture quality too much. In essence the lens is stunning with what it can do, allowing for maximum creativity in such a small camera.I experimented with this camera and its zoom lens. What blew me away was a shot I took in a totally dark room, focusing on a balloon with print on at 50X zoom. The result was a flawless picture whilst using the Auto mode. The picture had a minute amount of grain and the printing on the balloon was perfectly reproduced. The Panasonic cameras I have been used to, could not take such a perfect photo, as they are very poor at taking night shots. All I can say is every night shot I have taken with this camera has been virtually perfect.If the more experienced photographer wants greater freedom than that offered by the AUTO mode, there is a myriad of different settings which allow everything from fully automatic, semi automatic, differing shutter and apeture priorities, scene modes, JPEG and RAW modes which allow virtually every function of the camera to be set by the user. I have never used a digital camera which allows for so much control by the user.I must say I am an AUTO setting fan and on this mode picture quality is outstanding and with a little bit of adjustment to the menu, it eliminates red eye problems, has face recognition technology and even gives a warning if someone in a photo has their eyes shut. I have found whilst set in auto mode it has chosen the apeture and shutter speed perfectly virtually every time. It is almost impossible to take a bad photo in AUTO mode. I cannot express how impressed I am with this camera whilst using this mode.The Video function records in HD and again offers superb quality pictures and allows for the zoom function whilst filming. The sound quality is also very good and is HD.The LCD screen is large and very clear. Once set up it can display a multitude of information which helps the photographer who wants to use the RAW mode. There is a small viewfinder but I prefer the multi angle, flipable LCD screen.The quality of the camera appears to be top notch. Although it is made from plastic it appears to be quality plastic and is nicely balanced in how it feels to hold. The grip could do with being rubberised, but this is a minor problem.The battery needs charging for 2 hours and lasts for about 350 shots. It comes with a strap and lens cover. You will need to buy an SD card and I would suggest nothing less than a class 10 card from a good manufacturer, so that it can cope with all the features of this amazing camera.There is one downside and for the life of me I cannot understand why Canon did this, the internal flash needs to be manually raised and does not pop out automatically when needed. There is a traditional horseshoe flash point on top of the camera and maybe the non auto pop of the flash may have something to do with the ability to use a more powerful flash gun. Non auto pop up may be there so avoiding damage to the internal flash if it flipped up whilst a flash gun was being used.I can only find minor flaws with this camera, which are far outweighed by the beautiful pictures it produces, myriad of functions it has and ease of use in AUTO mode. Whilst I have used a DSLR and not liked it because of the lens constraints, I have used this little beauty and loved every minute of it. The zoom is outstanding and the lens produces almost perfect results. I could go on and on about how much I adore this camera, but I guess the reader gets how I feel about it.

The 50x optical zoom (1200mm equivalent) has been awesome and allowed me to get high quality shots from very long distances. Even the 100x (optical plus digital zoom) has produced some surprisingly usable pictures with good detail. Image stabilization works well enough allow me to take good hand-held pictures at full optical zoom, but a tripod is always preferred if available. On the wide-angle side, the camera zooms out to a very good 24mm equivalent lens.  The manual controls are great to have (shutter speed, apeture). The digital level feature on the display was very useful to ensure a level shot. The camera has many other useful features (multiple focusing modes, ability to control the power of the flash, compensation to make pics brighter or darker).

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  I love taking pictures of wildlife and this camera is great for that with its 50x optical zoom.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is the low resolution EVF and the very annoying feature that when you take a still photo during video this causes the video to black out and pause when the photo is taken.

Others who are more knowledgeable will likely have other things they also like, but for wildlife, to get this zoom without carrying a lens that would need a cart, is really something.  So far I'm very impressed with the images.I've also liked these cameras because of the ability to use the viewfinder or the display on the back, which faces the camera body when not in use.  Great for protecting the screen.  The display also rotates to allow for many ways to hold the camera.The Amazon price was amazing for a recent introduced camera!Bill", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Bob Anderson \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R3QCDQI7TELT33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meets all expectations and more, reach out and touch someone!!

A good buy for a beginner to middle range photographer, but not for the advanced photographer.  Excellent zoom lens for bird shots and good jpg (better than RAW development in this case!).  Faster than the SX40, lighter and overall improved.  You will need a monopod or tripod to shoot with this as that is what I carry.  Battery life is excellent as I took 1,000 shots over four hours (however, I turned off the camera when not shooting).  In fairness to the SX50, most of the shots I took would have been impossible with its superior zoom reach.  Probably the best bridge camera on the market.However, the camera should be considered legally blind as it can't focus in dim light, shadows or on dark subjects.  Really searches.

see:[...]An interesting point about the digital zoom is that the video has much better resolution at 51-200x than still photos.  The image stabilization is also a great help when taking photos at high zoom.While the zoom is unbeatable for a camera in this class, there are other features that could be improved upon.  The macro focus distance is rather far in comparison with other point and shoot cameras.  It didn't come close to the really up-close focusing of my old Olympus.Also, it is lacking a built in panorama mode.  Panorama photos must be montaged using the software provided with the camera.My only other disappointment was that the Sport Scene mode and the high burst shooting modes make the screen go black while shooting each pic.  This means that you are unable to follow your fast moving subject, thus negating the function.  How are you supposed to follow a fast moving object if your viewfinder goes black with each shot?Other than these minor qualms, the SX 50 takes some stunning photos especially from far away!I would recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't want the hassle of a DSLR but still wants high quality photos.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Has done it AGAIN!!!", "Author": "John C", "ReviewID": "R2H1G2Y706SO09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been buying Canon cameras for as long as I can remember.

But like many people, I find it gets a bit burdomsome carrying around numerous lenses, flashes, etc. I've been through a number of superzooms before and not been impressed enough to keep them long term (Nikon s10, Nikon P90/100, Fujifilm HS10) but the thought of a 1200mm lens made me bite the bullet again.This time I think I have a keeper, at least until the next model comes out!I bought it at 11.38pm on a Saturday night, then used it for a 6 hour hike, followed by dinner, taking about 200 photos, and 4 x 3 second videos.The good: - Really sharp photos. I was amazed by some close ups of leaves and seed pods that were about 20 metres away from me. I truly thought they were as sharp as my dslr - Reasonable weight, ok for holding and carrying - Good battery life. The battery indicator was still at 3 bars after the 200 photos (battery indicator has 3 bars- 3 bars- full, 1 bar- nearly empty) - Good build quality. - Smooth and quick lens zooming - Quick and accurate auto focus lock, at least during the day. Really impressed. - Nice to have some control over shutter speed and aperture. - LCD is sharp and accurate, even though it's not the max resolution you can see on some other cameras. Swivel screen is versatile too.The not so good: - It's good that there's a dedicated video button. It's not so good that it's positioned in a place I bumped it several times, hence my 4 x 3 sec videos. - On/off switch not quite in easy reach- would love to be able to just use a finger to flick a switch on/off, but I usually have to reach across and look to press- just takes an extra second, and I find I miss that bird flapping it's wings. I'll get used to the layout I suspect. - Deleting photos. So far, I've only been able to delete one photo at a time, on the camera. The only method I can think of for deleting multiples is to connect to the computer, go to the File directory and click them. - Speaking of computer, there was no included USB cable in my box. I think I read someone else said this too. If this is normal, it's a strange ommission. - The battery latch cover is a bit light. Twice during the hike it got bumped and the camera turned off, as there is no internal additional battery latch/lock and the battery moved. - The 24mm is not really 24mm, perhaps more like 30mm. I wouldn't rely on this for true wide angle photos.Overall, the SX50 is a great camera to have around during the day, and for travelling. It's capable, takes really good quality photos, and the large zoom allows you to compose photos you'd never have considered when using your normal 28-120mm type lenses.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX50 Digital Cameria Review", "Author": "John D.

This camera, the Canon SX50 HS, has turned me around on Canon.First off if you are buying this, you probably are looking for the zoom.  The 50x optical zoom is incredible and unlike previous cameras I have owned, the additional digital zoom is not totally worthless.  The digital zoom adds a mild amount of noise to the picture, but with a stable hand it is still possible to take a relatively high quality picture.When left to its own devices this camera fairs well in both well lit and night time outdoor scenes.  Where it seems to have the most trouble is high contrast scenes, like trying to take a picture into dimly lit building from a bright outdoors.  I think the Nikon had a leg up on this camera in this particular situation, but I was more interested in the zoom.Nighttime pictures with this camera come out impressive, much more so than the SX170.  I have a bit a trouble getting the camera to take sharp daytime pictures, but I am learning and there are many examples of amazing daytime images from more skilled individuals [...]  There is definitely a lot to be gained by manually tuning settings with this camera [...]  All that said, this probably isn't the camera to try and capture great shots at a sports event.  I do notice a bit of blurring in pictures with motion.  With motion, or even worse low light + motion, it can take a couple attempts to get a picture I am fully satisfied with.As for the battery, it lasts quite a while, well over 300 images.  If that is a major selling point for you, just keep in mind batteries for this camera are ~$10; keep a few on hand maybe even a second charger if it is a big issue.  I personally did not want to sacrifice quality, price, or size in order to gain longer battery life.My main gripe with this camera is that it didn't include a USB cable, and it doesn't use the same one my smartphone uses.  I figure if you are going to design the camera to take the less common type of connector you should at least include a cable.All my gripes combined are not enough to dock a star for this camera.  For the niche it is an extremely good camera.  I call it a niche, but the niche is basically doing everything well and on the fly without having to change lenses or tweak numerous settings.  This camera is well rounded and inexpensive, so don't expect it to outperform a DSLR.

So-so quality in existing light situations; again, you're not paying top dollar either. It's good for me, but for those who love dark settings/existing light it will be iffy results, sometimes great, sometimes not depending on conditions. Shooting at a full, bright moon on a clear night with stars will give good results, shooting the moon when overcast at night with tree branches will not have a good result. You will totally love the zoom, and the anti-shake feature at extreme zoom is excellent. I shot a wedding recently, and got some great candids. 300 people and I could stand at the far end of the hall and easily frame a head & shoulders on someone at the other end. They didn't know I was photographing them so I got some really nice shots. No blurs from handshake, there was slightly dimmed lighting in the hall for mood. General outdoor has excellent, deep color. On scenics, especially wildlife, you will kiss this camera, trust me. Your finger will never leave the zoom lever.

Based on the reviews, I expected better speed and more artistic flexibility. I was wrong.First, the SX50HS's nighttime performance is far below that of the previous SX cameras, due to the so-called \"upgrades.\" First, if you're using a shutter slower than 1 second, the camera takes away any ISO options and locks it on 100- Since I like to take a lot of SFX photos, that limitation sucks.Second, it has a hard time focusing at night- It can't seem to find anything in low-light situations and is constantly searching. The SX30IS is exceptional in this regard but the SX50HS sucks.Finally, the only option for night shooting is a \"high speed burst\" which combines several photos, similar to HDR. You have no option but a tripod with this and if anything moves in the shot, it's lost.The only remaining options are to toggle back and forth between manual and aperture priority till you find something useable.Zoom- incredible. Flip-out screen- marvelous. Daytime performance exceeds most DSLRs and can be operated with one hand.Quicktime video? WTF were they thinking? That sucks.

Maybe most important, the pictures are very high resolution, clear, with excellent color. I haven't had the camera very long, so most of the pictures have been taken on \"auto\" or the sports setting. They're beautiful. The camera has a 50x zoom, and you need to be well-braced or use a tripod to keep the camera steady. If you do that, you get great pictures over a very long distance. The camera has a huge assortment of settings and features. It takes a lot of time to acquaint yourself with them, and there's no manual. You have to get it on-line and there are too many pages to print. A manual would have been a huge plus.If it's been a long time since you changed cameras, here's something you might keep in mind: I always used my all-in-one printer as the vehicle for getting my SD card read into my computer. It wouldn't do it with my new camera. At first I thought it might be the camera. Then I thought it might be the SD card. Then I read that my OS (XP) might not read the newer type of SD card. I ultimately found that it was the printer that couldn't read it. I put the SD card in an SD card reader and popped it into a USB port and it worked fine.Overall, I really like this camera.

Vanweerthuizen", "ReviewID": "R2ZVNCJVX2TBJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome general purpose camera, particularly for outdoor use.  The 50x zoom is versatile and fun. This is a very intelligent camera with a high quality image sensor (well, high quality for the sensor size; this sensor is small and fights all the drawbacks that come with small sensors. But the high quality of the sensor compensates somewhat for its small size.) The 50x zoom is best used from a tripod; hand holding the camera, even with image stabilization, it's hard to avoid blur from camera shake when zoomed in that far. But this camera gives me great shots at maximum zoom when I use a tripod and remote trigger. I am also glad this model has a flash hotshoe so I can use an inexpensive Neewer speedlite with it (the speedlite helps significantly with indoor shots, especially when using bounce flash off of ceilings.)  I like that this model allows images to be saved in raw mode.I primarily take my camera with me on bicycle trips, shooting various scenery and items of interest. For that, this camera is the perfect fit for me.  Because this camera doesn't get good battery life, I carry several spare batteries with me when I go on trips. (So far I've been very happy with Opteka NB-10L 1800mAh Ultra High Capacity Li-ion Batteries.)  To protect the lens on this camera, especially when outdoors, I highly recommend a 67mm adapter ring and a 67mm UV protective filter. There are also 58mm adapter rings available for this camera, but I've discovered they cause vignetting (obstruction of the view in the corners of the image) while shooting in maximum wide angle. The 67mm adapter rings don't give me that problem.This is not the best camera for the price if you mostly shot indoors. Indoors, you won't need the 50x zoom very often, which is this camera's primary feature. And superzoom cameras generally don't perform as well as other cameras in the low light conditions one generally finds indoors. Another drawback to this camera's design is the limited range of aperture adjustment for controlling exposure or limiting depth of field.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "daylebread", "ReviewID": "RQ6T7OKJMUD8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every version of the powershot series.

So back in the box it all went, I sent for a Refund & good ol' Amazon was MORE than willing to give me a full refund.The next day it left my home & when I went back to look at other models, I decided I was NOT going to limit myself to a mere $200-250 price tag. I stepped up my budget and BOY am I ever glad I did! I saw this Canon SX50 & went to You Tube, looking at all the Reviews and demonstrations of the camera & it's 50X zoom. I splurged and put this SX50 on my Amazon.com Store Card.Believe me now & hear me later, I looked at EVERY single bridge camera out on the market in the span of a month and the SX50 is THE best deal going....could it have a 16MP on it, sure; but you'll not miss it, the pixs on this camera are just fine.I got the camera yesterday & I am ALREADY thrilled and can't WAIT to get to CA in March and try it out on the Auto Club Speedway!! This zoom is INCREDIBLE, the camera is sturdy, the functions are MANY but almost idiot-proof....I hate having to \"study\" a manual on anything, but this camera's functions are straight forward and almost make sense the way they are programmed into the camera and set up to guide the owner thru taking pictures or videos. No more dragging the manual out EVERY time you go to take an unusual picture or video,.....the instructions make it pretty safe to bet your pix will be good.If you're curious about the bridge cameras, go to You Tube, you find out ALL you want to know about this little gems.I paid $403 for mine, it's already gone down to $399 and might go down more, I have probably already sold at least 3 of these for Amazon! The filters, hood, adapters, accessories and cases are cheap enough here, or on Ebay...you do not have to be rich to HAVE a good bridge camera. You don't have to be a semi or pro photographer, this camera will walk you thru everything. The CD w/ apps and manual is easy to read and the manual is easy enuff to pull up anytime.I used to take LOTS of photos for my work & personal use with my old Yashica FX-2 & this Canon is the closest thing to my old faithful 35mm I have found yet, unless I wanted to spend the megabucks for a DSLR. Don't hesitate, if you want a good bridge camera and have $400, this is the best one to date.

This camera on auto is perfect if you want really good pics with more than a little point and shoot.  I've gotten great raves from my friends on the photos from Patagonia and the Straights of Maggellan.I used mainly the eyepiece viewfinder, the digital display is beautiful on the fold out viewfinder, but a little awkward. I think I probably got better battery life as well by not using it much.  I did use it for awkward angles as it tilts and swivels great.  But again in super bright sun the eyepiece is best.The burst shots allowed me to get some really good pics of dolphins surfacing, and birds in flight, very fast.  Only a few times did I go to the menu to change settings.  These cameras have come so far so fast it's amazing.  It offers way more control than the average person would ever want or need.The 50X lens was so much better than I would have ever imagined.  I bought it from Amazon thinking \"if this isn't what I want , it's going back\".  It's a keeper.

I also liked the Panasonic but sold it to get the added zoom of the Canon SX50 and the fun settings of miniature and especially fisheye. On a recent vacation I took about a thousand pictures with the new Canon and a new Panasonic SLR.  How did I fare?I like the CanonSX50 quite a bit. The crazy zoom alone is a feature worth having. I've taken pictures of subjects barely visible and zoomed in close up using the camera hand held. I could get the same reach with the Panasonic FZ150 by adding a teleconverter and holding the camera steady on a ledge or with a tripod. With the Canon SX50 I don't need a teleconverter.Picture quality with this Canon is very good, not spectacular, but for a long zoom point and shoot far more than adequate. I took quite a few pictures of alpaca who were lolling about in the shade; the pictures turned out well with good detail and clarity after a little bit of post processing.The menu takes some getting used to. It's not intuitive, so it'll take lots of hands on experimentation to learn. Having had the SX30 previously, I learned to navigate the menu. I much prefer the easier to use menu of the Panasonic FZ150.While on vacation I took some night pictures of the same scenes previously photographed with the FZ150.  The night pictures with the Panasonic turned out better.Comparing the Pansonic FZ150 to the Canon, I can't say that the Canon necessarily takes better pictures than the FZ150, but I love the incredible zoom of the Canon and have a lot of fun with the fish-eye effect.Many neat features are built into the Canon SX50; so many that it takes lots of trial and error to learn how to access and take advantage of them. If you want a long reach and don't want to fool with carrying more than one camera or changing lenses, this may be the camera for you.You can't add filters to the Canon unless you buy a relatively inexpensive converter ring. Then you can screw on 58mm filters to protect the Canon's lens.NOTE - Initially I became very frustrated by not being able to get the flash to work or being able to use the bracketing feature. I was ready to give up and return the camera. Then I got on line and discovered that there's a little plastic cover that slides into the hotshoe.

Was worried that at 1200mm f/6.5, the images won't be good. I was wrong. Managed to get good shots of a cat even at ASA 200. The bokeh was super creamy for the 1200mmm cat portrait.One reviewer maintained that when you view shots, the lens will retract. Perhaps I'm fortunate - this hasn't happened to me.Downside? Would be great if the Canon could be like the FZ200 with f/2.8 all the way.Of course in a few months. maybe even sooner, I'll gripe that the 1200mm lens is not long enough.18 Jan 13HA, just as I said - was shooting some birds on the way to work today. It's a small bird that hangs upside down. Have no idea what it is - it's blue and yellow with a long curved beak.ANYWAY, the problem is, the bird flits from tree to tree. And the electronic zoom lever gets annoying. A manual zoom (like what Fuji does) would be good because then if you get in too tight, you just turn the ring the other way. With e zoom levers, the focal length kind of jumps, so either you're too tight or too far.SO it's not just about a longer zoom but a zoom that's easy to control.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 50x Wide-Angle...", "Author": "Joe Kiss", "ReviewID": "R3B1ILZ9CNV7AY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was given as a gift and it takes fantastic photos.

A couple of quirks.", "Author": "Rolla Gravett \"Rolla Gravett\"", "ReviewID": "R1X8KPNCTEV5OI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is going to be a quick review of the SX50 HS camera.  I also have the Panasonic FZ200 camera and they compare very favorably in many areas.  I like the image quality of the SX50 camera and the noise is a little better than the FZ200 camera.  I like the big zoom, and it is fairly easy to take very detailed crisp shots at full 50X zoom hand held in daylight conditions.It does have a couple of quirks.  One is at any shot over 1 second, the camera automatically shoots at ISO 80, and a lot of people don't like that.  Another quirk is in Aperture Priority (probably Program as well) the exposure time will not go over 1 second shutter speed no matter how dark the environment is.  If the light and shutter speed are not adequate the camera will take a dark shot.  That makes the camera somewhat hard to use in low light dim shots in Aperture Priority.  I would use Auto in those low light conditions.  In Auto it will just set the ISO higher to get the shot, but with that comes more noise.  In many cases I think it is a good thing to have the ISO real low to keep out the noise in low light shots, but many want the option to use a higher ISO with a longer exposure time.Overall I really like the camera and plan on keeping it. The lens is a little bit slow, but it seems to do fairly well in low light as long as nothing is moving, which is the same as any other bridge camera.  It has a lot of features and takes great pictures!  The price is great too.  Not only does it zoom to 50X, but does so with very crisp sharp photos at that amount of zoom.  The stability system works very well too, allowing hand held shots at max 50X zoom with great results.I have the Panasonic FZ150 and FZ200 cameras in addition to the SX50.  I also have a Nikon D7000 with the Nikon 18-300mm lens, as well as a Sony Nex F3.

I purchased this camera because it's versatile, has lots of bang for moderate bucks, with a good-enough lens for short and long shots in most shooting situations. All in all, this camera has proven to be a sweet, sweet deal, well suited to my current needs and interest in photography.If you are new to digital photography as I was, the number of features and combinations thereof initially may seem overwhelming.  Expect to invest some time (as in hours) reading the manual, tinkering and testing features. (The manual is only available as a pdf file.)In addition to registering the product at the Canon site, you can download an ImageBrowserEX utility for copying of files from the memory card. The utility also can be used for some basic editing tasks.  You may also want to download and install the Digital Photo Professional application from the Canon web site.  It includes some additional editing functionality, like cropping images, tweaking contrast and saturation.  These two applications have so far proved to be good enough for most of my needs.The many features of the camera have been well covered by other reviews. I would like to remark upon one that has turned out to be quite useful for me: the custom delayed timer.  Most cameras advertise a maximum of 10 seconds delayed time to get into pictures. For more time, you must invest in a delayed timer accessory.Alas, for the peculiar shot angles that I like to take, 10 seconds max is often insufficient.  The Canon PowerShot SX50 HS offers the flexibility to customize the delay to as long as 30 seconds.  In all my research -- including much higher priced models -- I never found another model with such a generous delayed timer.

Of course, the SX50 has a full menu system with which I can control the camera's configurations should I wish - it's an enormously flexible piece of equipment.

There is no noticeable recovery time between photos; I've never found myself having to wait on the camera to reset in order take a picture.  The image stabilization is amazing; I took some photos while riding in a cart on a bumpy street - most came out unbelievably clear and focused.  Flash throws a good distance when needed.I usually shoot through the viewfinder, but I LOVE the articulated LED screen!  It allows me to take photos from a lower level without having to kneel.  I can be discreet when taking candid shots, as I am looking down at the screen, not directly toward my subject.  On a recent tour, I was able to lift the camera over the heads of other tourists and perfectly frame the shots I wanted.  It's idea for macro photography, plus the LED screen is protected when it is closed.It's the design of the grip that keeps me from giving this camera 4 stars.  I don't know how many times I, or someone I asked to take a photo of me, set off the self-timer or activated one of the menu items.  While this is not a heavy camera as compared to a DSLR, it is not as light as many other point-and-shoot cameras.  It requires a firm grip, but you must be careful where you grab it.  The normal \"SLR grip,\" if you know what I'm getting at, places the heel of your thumb directly over some of the controls.  This is annoying, esp when a shot presents itself only briefly; the delay involved in resetting the camera after the self timer - or some other function - kicks in has cost me multiple photo opportunities.As with many cameras now, it comes with no user manual; you must download and print it out.  I am still exploring features as I attempt to broaden my skills.  It offers many of the features available on high-end DSLR's without the need for purchasing expensive lenses, so is a good camera to learn on b4 investing in a more expensive camera.I would recommend you buy at least one extra battery if you plan on taking a lot of shots in a day, as when you are traveling.

The only problem I have with the camera is the Function/Set button is at a place where my thumb is always inadvertantly changing the ISO, exposure or other settings. I had to continually remind myself to remember to keep my thumb away from that area.  Otherwise, the camera is a gem. I like to use to use the camera to capture images of animals and to document family events. Whatever the scene, the result is always a perfect photo with sharp images, and deep colors. I submitted my photos to an online photo service that'll convert your images into a book form and I couldn't believe how beautiful my photos where. I am no way a pro photographer, but 'dang-gum' my pictures looked great! Furthermore, there is an option to use the camera either in manual mode or auto for even more control. I've had this camera since February and I am really enjoying it. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun with photography, now.

Some of the buttons had been moved but overall the usage was the same. A pixal rating above 12mp would have been better but the RAW pictures are awesome. I had always shot using JPEG until giving it a try with the SX50. Why did I wait so long? Detail, color and clarity is far beyond the JPEG photos. Software to work with the RAW images comes with the camera. I recommend using RAW for your best photos. Get a high capacity card and you won't have to worry about running out of storage space.The software will convert the RAW image to TIFF to use with Photoshop. The included software allows some capability to work with the photo but not as Photoshop or Photoshop Elements so this is a nice choice to have.The SX40 produced good photos and the SX50 does as well. Powerup is very fast. Color is very good and there are many options for different situations in lighting and environment to help get the best shot.

There also are occasional struggles with the automatic focus. The Coolpix P510 is only 42x, but its 16.1 megapixels seem to produce sharper images.

Changed up from the Kodak Max Z990 (with the same size and tech of sensor = 12M CMOS), and there is no comparison. The pictures are so much sharper, focus is easier to acquire, and shot to shot speed is just superb. Particular favourites are the 'stitch-assist' feature, the multi-shot feature, the HDR feature, and the HD movies where the zoom is totally silent.If you are in America (as I was recently) then you can get this on Amazon dotcom for just \u00a3245 (@$360) equivalent. That's one hell of a saving on the UK price of \u00a3360+ (where Canon seems to think one dollar equals one pound). Even though the misers at Canon won't give it a worldwide warranty, and Squaretrade at the moment are backing that up, it was worth it. The savings alone will let me get accessories like lens hoods, extra batteries, and still be on the up.There are various comments online about battery life being poor compared to the SX40HS. However, I actually found in real world use, that I went back to using the EVF as if it was an SLR like old times.

This camera has so many options that the printed owners manual runs to 258 pages! It functions well as a point-and-shoot on auto, but the full range of options for control of any feature is very much available. I personally love the fact that it will date and time stamp images if one wants, solving the \"when did I take this image?\" problem, though many may not see that as a problem. I don't use the video features of any camera, so I can't offer an opinion there. It does burst images, best image select, panorama stitching and just about any other feature one could want. I don't find the controls particularly intuitive; a proud owner will need to spend some serious time with the owners manual to really take advantage of many of the features.The printed images are glorious, crisp, well saturated and capable, if one wanted, of 24\" x 36\" poster size images with no loss of resolution. Extreme cropping also is possible without loss of visible resolution. The camera comes with a lens cap, a strap, one battery and a CD with the owners manual. Nothing else is available; spare batteries can be found at any good battery store; the proprietary batteries seem to be hard to find but others seem to work well.In summary this is an extremely capable camera, but a complex one with only mildly intuitive controls. Time with the owners manual will lower the learning curve. I think at the moment this 50X super zoom may be the winner in the SZ wars; more importantly, the camera does deliver superb images including those shot at very-long-telephoto ranges. The LCD in the back is large and swivels out at any angle one likes; this makes shots in close quarters much more fun. As background, I'm in a large category of photographers usually called advanced amateurs; pros would probably prefer far more expensive SLRs and casual photographers will be well served by much simpler compact cameras, which offer amazing resolution and imagery these days.

My previous camera is the Lumix FZ-50. A fantastic camera that still holds up pretty well next to this one, at least for what I want to accomplish. I have to agree that shooting at full zoom the picture gets blurry, it's not that big a deal tho, on a tripod or just using your body to keep the camera steady you can get a decent shot. The controls feel fancy and easy to use compared to my other camera and yes, there's a lot to learn, but if you're used to cameras like this it can't be all that difficult. Image quality so far is great. For someone who doesn't know a lot about photography, that's just beginning to learn more and that wants to be able to point and shoot as well and still get great looking shots this is the camera. The zoom is incredible and making videos while walking is super smooth.

No more camera bags full of different lenses.  This camera does it all, and it does it so good that I haven't met anybody with a DSLR that can do what I do with this camera.

I didn't notice until it was too late to do anything about it but the tripod socket on the OLYMPUS was PLASTIC! & broke out in a relatively minor fall ( $130 to repair ) & still plastic! Without a tripod it was very difficult to get clean uz shots with that camera. When the SX50HS became available I had already done some research & decided on a Canon as a replacement. So far I've only used the AUTO setting & found the image stabilization & tracking systems so superior to what I had that I've used it more without the tripod than with. The only faults I've found are the diopter is a bit stiff & difficult to fine tune & the Canon battery drains faster than the Photive backup I bought for it. If you're considering this camera there is an adapter ( $8.00 ) you'll need to attach filters, hoods etc. My setup has one w/uv filter & standard hood which I expect will break off ( the adapter ) without damage to the camera & only the replacement cost of the adapter in the event of an accident. This is a fantatastic camera & with the quality of the shots I'm getting ( mostly birding )I can't justify the price of a DSLR.

This is a good way to learn some the settings and modes without jumping off in to a high end DSLR with multiple lense. Don't be fooled it's not a DSLR. Go to Best Buy and look at this camera and then pick up a DSLR and you will see the difference. Just the feel of weight and quality is night and day. You also will not get out the door with a DSLR for under $400(which you can with the PowerShot SX50). You'll have to shell out another $200 for a bottom end DSLR and you still will not have the zoom power of the lense on the PowerShot. So enough of that, back to the camera. So far I've gotten some great pictures with it. Maco shots are good on it and the zoom is insane! I've gotten some great shots of the moon, with great detail. It's a little tight between the lens and the right side grip. The strap they send with the camera is junk and the battery is so, so.

There are many things the Canon doesn't do which I had hoped for, but all-in-all it's a great camera.  While few of these bridge camera's can compete with DSLR's for image quality, the cost of a single lens for a DSLR can buy you a second camera.  I will say that the SX50 is a great camera in this price range, but like any camera, it's up to you to learn how to use it within it's limitations.  Also, You'll never know what this camera is capable of until you take it out of auto mode.  Finally, the RAW images are better quality than the jpeg so you can step the quality up a notch by going RAW.What I like most about this camera is the zoom and the articulating screen, both of which I find indispensable for fun photography.  While DSLR's are arguably better, there are many shots that a DSLR owner will pass up because they can't get close enough.  As an example,  You've all seen shots of a huge moon hanging over a boat/tree etc... Very impressive photo, in my mind!  To take this kind of picture you need a boat/tree or anything else so far away that from where you are standing that it is smaller than the moon.  You zoom in until the moon and subject fills your frame and snap the photo.  This can be done with a DSLR, but many times requires a zoom lens that is too expensive for the average human being.The articulating screen is fantastic for those shots that require you to play twister to get.

Both the Canon SX-40 HS and SX-50 HS controls are laid out pretty much the same. Both cameras takes great photos, but the SX-40 HS had a few quirks that bothered me for the 2 years I had that camera, but the SX-50 HS does not have any odd quirks when taking photos yet.Anyways, I have used the Canon SX-50 HS digital camera for awhile now and took it on vacation as I required a digital \"point & shoot\" with a pretty decent optical zoom and this camera has the zoom I require for my long-range scenic photo needs of mountains and similar items.The good stuff: Long 50X optical zoom [1200mm zoom power] and it works quite well & pretty fast. Very easy to use.  My outdoor photos seems to come in quite well, especially in lower light situations such as sunrises or sunsets. Using the optical zoom, the photos will vary and the more zoom you use, the worse the photos outside turns out. Modest zoom usage and the outdoor photos are still pretty good. Marco/super close up photos with this camera is absolutely great!!! I have got bird photos so close and clear with this camera, you can see the feather textures so easily with this camera....simply amazing!! Moon shots with this camera is excellent & as good as the Canon SX-40 HS. Indoor shots seems pretty decent with this camera too, as long as you're using the flash. Overall, photo quality with this camera is very good. Controls are laid out decently for the most part. Optical viewfinder is a nice touch, even tho I use the flip out LCD viewfinder most of the time, but in real bright sunny weather outside, I will use the optical viewfinder instead. The SPORT MODE on this camera is very nice to have & very nice feature!! This camera uses the common SD and SDHC photo card, a nice plus. Video quality with this camera is decent. I only shoot short videos with any digital camera and the video quality with this camera seems as good as my prior digital cameras I have had over the past few years.Photos are a bit \"softer\" with this camera compared to my former Nikon P-510 camera, but that's just a minor issue.The bad stuff: The video button is placed right next to the thumb rest on the backside of this camera and it's easy to activate by mistake. Canon should have placed the video button on the top of the camera instead of the backside. The external flash hot-shoe on top of the camera lacks a cover, something the SX-40 HS had [a cover].Battery life with this camera seems pretty good and uses the same battery the SX-40 HS uses. Battery charges pretty quick also, 2-4 hours usually with the supplied Canon battery charger. Get a few extra batteries also if you plan on taking a trip or taking lots of photos at any public event.Overall, I think that if you need a pretty long zoom in a point & shoot camera without having to fumble around with a few different lens & still want a very good photo, this Canon SX-50-HS camera will do the job just fine.I am pleased I now own the Canon SX-50 HS digital camera and it hopefully will serve my photo needs for a year or two with minimal problems. I even bought a second SX-50 HS digital camera because I like this one so much and the second one works just fine too and is my \"back-up camera\" now.

I bought primarily this for my wife, although with the thought that I'd use it now and then as well.  We just moved near Klamath Lake, OR, one of the best birding locations anywhere, so the 1200mm equivalent telephoto very much played in our decision.In testing/learning about the camera, I've found that the stabilization works very well.  I've gotten some very sharp images of a bald eagle feeding on a fish, from 150', 1200mm @ 1/160th !  The images over the entire range of the zoom seem quite a bit better than I expected.  I may have to buy a 2nd one, just for the telephoto, a quality  long lens for my 7d is 4-5 times as expensive, weighs a ton, and no way can I justify it.The downsides to the camera;1.  It tends to clip highlights, shooting RAW files helps a lot to recover them.2.  The buttons on the back are almost impossible not to bump while holding/carrying the camera, I wish they took a firmer pressure/click to activate.3.  The menus and the various ways they are accessed are quite confusing, with many things grayed out or active, depending on whether you are shooting jpg or jpg + RAW and also depending on what mode you are in.  Having the 200+ page manual only as a PDF file doesn't help matters.Although somewhat of a pain, these things don't stop me from giving it 5 stars, it's an amazing camera that, even on full auto, takes exceptional photos.Steve", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for birdwatching bird photography.

I love their Elph pocket cameras. And I hate the ergonomics on their DSLRs, they can never get the grip right at least on the lower end Digital Rebel line. Nikon has far better feeling DSLR on the low end.For this camera I had high hopes. But I find the electronic viewfinder (EVF), the heart of the user experience, to be one of the worst implemented EVF ever. I'm not a snob on EVF. I thought the EVF on the Sony Alpha a55 were well done when most other users hated it. I have a Panasonic DMC-G5 and think the viewfinder is very good. I have owned a number of Panasonic FZ long zooms going back to FZ28, FZ35, FZ47, etc and I think the viewfinders there are very usable. But this viewfinder on the SX50 is so small its feels like a toy camera and really reminds me of some poor Fuji EVFs from years ago.I compared the SX50 and the diminutive SX510 side by side. I really believe that if you are going to have a digital camera that you really should have a viewfinder of some sort. This was part of the secret to the success of Canon's A-line of cameras of the 2000's. Even if you just have an optical-approximating viewfinder it works. There is something about boxing in the composition in a viewfinder that really helps you project in your mind what the final image will look like. That's something you can't really do with just a LCD screen that you likely cannot even really see in bright sunlight. (And you should note that Canon's A-series took a sharp dive when Canon started making the SX cameras years ago, so in many ways the (S2 IS/S5 IS) SX is the descendant of the A-series.) But in comparing the SX50 and SX510 my surprising conclusion is that I'd rather use the smaller SX510 because the EVF on the SX50 did nothing for me. Even the diopter adjustment on the SX50 felt like it was thrown in at the last minute, just not polished, not easy to find, and moved with the most of difficulty (almost like it had sand in the mechanism and would try and move past the setting you wanted. The tactile experience on the diopter adjustment was just bad).Besides EVF my other main concern with the SX50 is 50x zoom. 50x?  The rush to the long end of the zoom lens is as misguided as the other tech trends such as more megapixels. You can barely compose a shot at the longer end due to camera shake and focus hunting in many conditions. So it's great the temporary zoom-out control/indicator is on both the SX50 and SX510. And Canon is thinking about the image quality by staying with a 12mp sensor instead of 16mp or 20mp like some of the others.  A 20x or 30x option is better if you are looking for an all around camera and not just taking shots of birds or other creatures where the awe of the shot outweighs the other compromises in optical quality to get you there.Overall this camera did not feel like it has the same polish as other competitors in it's class.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Pete \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "RCK3H14BKRSF6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I found that there is a great difference between specifications and actual practical use of the camera.

I am not a \"photographer\" by any stretch, I'm just a girl with a blog who loves nature and enjoys photographing birds and such.  I had a Kodak Easyshare with a 21x zoom and was very happy with it until I started blogging, and following the blogs of some nature photographers.  It was soon apparent that my little camera was lacking.  A photographer I respect  recommended the Canon PowerShot SX50, saying it would do everything from macro photos to long-range bird photos without having to mess with lenses or complicated equipment.I have only had this camera a couple of weeks and so far I am very pleased with the quality of the photos and the zoom.  I have posted many photos of birds both on my blog and facebook to rave reviews.The camera itself probably rates a 4-star review.  My biggest complaint is that there are several function buttons on the back right where you would place your thumb.  I am forever accidentally hitting something I don't want to, and once I even messed up my settings because I accidentally hit a button, had a bunch of stuff pop up on the screen, and then couldn't undo what I did.  Also, the PDF manual that goes along with this camera is very complicated for a simple person like me.  Like I said, I'm not a photographer, I need simple and easy to understand.  The manual uses a lot of icons and symbols and also skips around a lot - giving you partial information and then referring you to another page for further information.  This is not very convenient.  If you are not already familiar with the lingo of photography, you will find the manual a bit overwhelming.  Even my photographer friend said the manual is not very user-friendly.I am not crazy about the auto mode on this camera.  I've been shooting in program mode, which I find easier to use.  I am slowly educating myself about the different settings and reading different photography books to improve my skills and understanding.

One negative is that the electronic viewfinder (EVF) is smaller than is desirable.

It is perfect for those who want to step up from point and shoot but are not willing to shell out 500+ for a DSLR and lenses. We went to the DC Cherry Blossom festival and took several pictures using only autosettings. We also tried the full zoom out aswell. Several of the images came out really well. The colors were vibrant and popping in the sun. Without the sun, the images were slightly washed out. The details in the images were awesome. Also the full zoom on the camera is something else. It was fun to zoom across the lake and be able to see what people were doing at the steps of a building far away. The auto settings sometimes tend to zoom in on the background when you really try to focus on the foreground. There are also times where it just does not know where to focus at all since there are too many things going on with the image. I'll upload some pictures to show examples of this.Before purchasing this camera, we took a look at the Panasonic Lumix FZ200K, Fujifilm Finepix hs30exr, nikon coolpix p510 and canon rebel T3 (Entry level DSLR). From the images on Amazon, we narrowed it down to the SX50, FZ200k, and rebel T3. We went to the store and played around with the rebel T3. Although the image quality for it was excellent, there was hardly any zoom with the 18-55mm lense (the standard lense that came with the camera). It would have been another additional $200-$400 on lenses if we wanted to get that camera. So we were down to FZ200k and SX50. This was a very very hard decision. Luckly, we found a website which helped us select the SX50 over the FZ200k. Google \"panasonic fz200k review\" and it is the 6th link from cameralabs.There is definitely a slight learning curve with this camera coming from a straight point and shoot. However, I think the autofocus does a good job of allowing people the flexibility of taking normal everyday pictures. The other options definitely gives those willing to experiment a wider capability.

I am not comparing this camera to the T2i or the Fuji. I am comparing it to the Kodak which, for it's time, had one of the longest zooms available (12x). I get perfect shots off of this camera, and it has nearly all the adjustments of a DSLR. I also acknowledge that I could have just gotten a bad camera, but the bulk of the camera makes it a no go for me, anyway. This review is for anyone who might really want a camera with one lens that will also do a lot of what a DSLR will do. This camera doesn't do it easy, if at all.I had high hopes for the SX50. I like a long zoom, and have no problems getting a great picture zoomed in. My problems were are follows:Much bulkier than the Z612 (makes sense, due to the long zoom, but adds one more negative for me)Bright sunlight, standing still, half the pictures still came out blurrier than the Z612. Tested on all settings, not just Auto.I cannot force a flash on the \"Auto\" setting. Sometimes \"Auto\" is almost what I want, but I want the fill the flash gives me. I don't want to the set the whole camera just to get a flash, but on Auto, in sunlight, even if there are shadows, you can't force the flash. The screen even says so, if you couldn't figure it out for yourself.Hard to set the \"Manual\" settings. I don't have big hands, but I was constantly hitting something other than what I wanted. The shot is gone.Controls are not intuitive for me. I liked the controls on the Nikon P520, but that camera was too slow to focus.The focus isn't \"on\" for this camera. On Auto settings, it frequently will focus on something in the background instead the the face in front of me. I had to re-focus several times, and still did not always get what I was trying for.Flash shots took three times longer to process that non-flash shots. What the hey?No way to take multi shots in auto settings. Once again, the screen said so.....Too many button pushes to set scenes, get your stored settings, set everything. Setting one thing is not difficult, setting f-stop AND shutter speed AND flash compensation AND ISO AND whatever else is cumbersome. (I don't have this much trouble with my T2i, although that was not the comparison-the Z612 is a breeze compared to the SX50)Viewfinder was useless. Too close to the body. Where do they think you are going to put your nose?Lens is VERY sensitive. It would try to focus in on the dust particles near the lens. No, it was not on macro.Too much lens flare in sunny situations. I had to keep moving around to avoid pink spots in my pictures. No, I was not looking into the sun, although my friend's Samsumg One Note got an incredible picture of the sun through the trees. The SX50 couldn't even hope to get that shot due to lens flare.It didn't equalize the picture on Auto settings. In a forest, where there is some shadow and some bright areas, the bright areas are over exposed, and the dark areas are still dark. Not so with my Z612.There may have been ways to accomplish what I wanted, but it wasn't easy to do.One the plus side, close up pictures were VERY sharp, but any standard vacation pictures were soft. The auto focus on the zoomed out setting was much quicker than any other camera I tried (but not quicker than my Z612). The zoom was phenomenal. The depth of field was better than the Z612, but not better than the Canon Powershot 260 a friend was using.Bottom line for me, I can't give this camera more than one star. The zoom and macro seemed very good, but I could not get a really good picture with it when it wasn't on zoom or macro. Auto settings were not usually sharp, and it took too long to set for conditions. I can see how this could be a good camera for birders, but I like a one-camera-does-all for vacations and arty pictures while on vacation.

I owned the sx30 for about 4 weeks before selling it. The image quality was horrid...The lens on the 30 wasn't sharp, the images were blurry and out of focus, the colors while accurate, were often overexposed.  So when I heard about the sx50 I was very hesitant. But I took at look at the images side by side with the SX 30, saw that the lens on this camera was much much sharper, and decided to give some credit to all the reviews that were raving about the improvement on the image stabilization system on this camera. It arrived and I had a chance on a nice sunny day to take some photos. I was blown away. The color is there, rarely did I have any overexposure (something commonly seen on many of the compact canon point and shoots), and the image stabilization allowed me. to capture moving birds at a decent 1/150-1/300 second all the way zoomed in. Full zoom. For a point and shoot camera for outdoor photography, I am very impressed by the images that this camera can put out. It balances color well. If you wish, you can take a look at some of the pictures I have uploaded on flicker.

As it so happens, I take the majority of my photos in conditions where there is sufficient light, as I enjoy nature photography and vacationing, most of which even in a dim forest, is still outside and allows enough light to this sensor to get great images.  But if this doesnt fit you, and  if your into indoor photography, and want to take pictures WITHOUT the flash, than I would encourage you to keep looking . The reason I say this is that ISO beyond 800 is not usable on this camera (as is the case with most point and shoots). You can still get some good shots in well lit rooms, but if you think your going to take this camera into a church and take wedding photos where there isn't sufficient light and have it look as sharp as it would outside without flash, I would look elsewhere. In fact there are two cameras I would recommend in this case.  Half the people on here are claiming that DSLRS are super expensive, which is what led me to this fairly camera. Its called the olymus EPM2. Its one of the new interchangable mirroless cameras on the market.  However instead of using Sonys expensive NEX lenses, it uses the Micro 4/3 system that is shared by both Panosonic and Olympus and that is taking off like wildfire right now among photography companies. If you can nab one for around 300-350 with the kit lens, its a good price as of April 2014.  The camera:The EPM2.Its a 16 megapixel camera that costs nothing next to a DSLR.  You can use hundreds of lenses and the image quality will put most point and shoots on the market to shame...save for the SX50 which im still just blown away by with good lighting. Anyhow the samples for the OlympusAgain to appreciate the optics, click on the three dots on the right hand side once the page loads and click on view all sizes, select the origional size, download and view. The senor on this camera is used in another 800 dollar camera made Olyumpus:https://flic.kr/p/eSzRgchttps://flic.kr/p/eSMwAChttps://flic.kr/p/eSzLR8Plus you can use lenses of various types as low as f1.2 for indoor photography.  Another one to look at on flicker is the Panasonic GF3. Here is a sample photo of that one:https://flic.kr/p/9T34MZ  (same process. Click on the three dots on the right side of the page and click download other sizes and select the origional size, download and view on PC).Anyhow the senors on those cameras are much larger and are on DSLR level without being nearly as expensive.  The Olympus is 16 MP, the Panasonic is 12 MP. You can find the panasonic for under 250 with the lens kit. Its a GREAT price!  Find a zoom lens 20-150mm for under 100 and your at the right at this price point.That being said, if your into the long zoom and you think you will be shooting mostly outdoors, I cant recommend the canon Powershot SX enough.  Its an amazing camera for what I use it for, and Im very impressed by the improvements in auto focus, color reproduction, lens sharpness (its a sharp lens for this focal length. Two thumbs up for canon on pulling that off!!), and while it may not be the best low light camera, you can still use flash inside and what you get outdoors with this giant zoom monster.. Besides the zoom itself, even zoomed out, the camera is sharp and takes great photos just as it is. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality megazoom out there.One last comment: Im not sure about how Apple processes preview pictures, but in windows viewer, you have to zoom in one or two clicks for the sharpness to pop on higher res. photos.

The images are plenty good enough for my purposes.  I previously owned the Canon SX40, and this newer model has noticeably shorter shutter lag, a needed improvement which shows up in my action photographs. For example I just attended an air show with the Navy Blue Angels performing. While standing at the front of the viewing area I was using the zoom function between 400mm and 1200mm, and captured a number of maneuvers being performed at 350-450 mph, in a couple of instances with jets entering the image area at 400mph from opposite directions, a total of 800 mph. I actually captured close-up images with the planes virtually nose-to nose, in one case actually overlapped - one with cockpit up, one down, all in single-shot mode. Certainly I had some misses also, mostly with planes zipping out of the image area in tight crops, not unexpected because I wasn't using a tripod..The SX40 would have been useless for this scenario. I also feel that the improved Auto Exposure  scene selection logic gives more consistent results in varying light and contrast situations. I love the new larger and sharper LCD.

Like the SX50, it was a beyond-the-basics point and shoot camera, meaning that you can put it in Manual setting easily.My Kodak had about 26x zoom. The Canon has 50x zoom. And it is WORTH.EVERY.PENNY! I went to a lake outside town last night after work. Geese and duck species often can be found here. I was standing about 40 feet away from the shore and got outstanding photos of wood ducks, mallards, and Canada geese. The colors are true to life and the images are crisp and clear until you get ALLLLL the way zoomed out. I had to do minimal post-processing cleanup.WORD TO THE WISE, THOUGH: You have to flip open the back screen of the camera to know what you're shooting in a hurry! Coming from the Kodak, I was used to being able to aim as I moved without having to fiddle with the screen covering, and I missed an amazing shot of a heron yesterday because I forgot about the screen.

I took 2,800 pictures and a dozen video clips with this camera and it fit my needs almost perfectly.  The incredible zoom capability was especially useful in two ways.  First, I can frame any shot exactly the way I want it.  With the old camera, I'd have to switch lenses or accept a shot which didn't frame the subject the way I wanted.  Second, the extra long zoom provides the ability to take candid closeups of subjects which are fairly distant.  It's also great for wildlife.  I even used it as a telescope to read signs or examine things at a distance.  The image stabilization works pretty well, though not 100% of the time.  Sometimes I would have to take a second or third shot to get a good image when on high telephoto.  The camera also compensated for low light very well up to a point.  In early evening or indoor light, sometimes pictures would come out better without a flash than with it.The video clip capability works well, but eats up a lot of space and will shut off after a few minutes.  It's really not a video camera.  A couple of negatives - the viewfinder was worthless, but the screen is bright enough to use in the sun unlike some other cameras.  Also, the video button is right where my thumb tends to rest when holding the camera, so it's easy to accidentally start a video.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Tara", "ReviewID": "RD2EQPCVT7FFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing camera for someone wanting to start a new hobbie!

Stanton \"Basil Fawlty\"", "ReviewID": "R1JC1TK9R63SG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Full disclosure - I am not a professional.  I am a serious armature who love learning about photography and improving my skills.  I currently own a Canon 7D DSLR with the kit lens and also the Canon 70-200 L F4.  I love that camera and use it when I am out on an event or outing where I really want to try to get some great pictures.  However, I decided I wanted a good light, small, bridge camera that I could use as a \"grab and go\" camera to use at events like Birthday parties, social gatherings, etc., where I'd like to get \"good\" pictures, but not out for great photography.  Just something I could keep in a small tot to have handy when I didn't feel like carrying the 7D with all it's lenses and associated trappings.I did a lot of research and it came down to this camera and  Panasonic FZ200.  Which camera takes the \"best\" pictures depends on which review you read, but in the end, after looking at may comparisons, the SX50 seemed to fit what I wanted.The Good:- The zoom is amazing.  And the IS is so good that I can take fairly good telephoto shots, even when hand-held.- Very fast multi-shot capability with the right SD card.- Lots of nice \"Picture Type\" settings that help you get a good shot under a variety of conditions, when you don't what to take the time (or don't have the time) to mess with manual settings.- Light weight, but doesn't feel \"cheap\"- Articulating LCD is a must!- Hot shoe for better flash- Shoots RAW!  This was a must for me!  I am starting to dabble with Photoshop and Lightroom and the ability to import RAW images was a must.  There are not many bridge cameras I found at this price point with RAW capability.- Excellent image quality, even at Telephoto distances.  It's \"Only\" 12MP but unless your printing huge posters, 12MP is plenty for most applications.The Bad:- Image noise when you get much above 400 - more noticeable than my 7D for sure so this Camera may not be a great choice for low light situations with no flash - a trade off I was willing to make to get the 50x zoom.- Flash does not automatically pop up.  You must lift it up manually to take a picture with flash.- The F-stop is not constant across the Zoom range.  The one thing the Panasonic I mentioned had in it's favor was a F2.8 across its full (30x) zoom.  Sine most of my shooting would be with decent light, or in situations where I could use flash, this was not a huge concern.  I can always fall back to the 7D if low light is an issue.- No USB cord.  Not going to ding it a star for this, but come on Canon, really?- The AVF (View Finder) is not the best.  Not as bad as I thought it would be based on some of the reviews I've read, but still not nearly as good as it could be.  Serve's it's purpose - just.Bottom line - I love  this camera and feel it will do just what O need it to do", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Power shot SX50HS", "Author": "sue schaefer", "ReviewID": "REHACVPM3XBC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to capture wildlife and so far love it.

It's best use is in full sun. It is really hard to get the shutter speed up on days with lesser lighting. The ISO can be cranked up but I have found this camera to lose image quality quickly with ISO over 200. Indoors with the flash it does a pretty good job also. The flash isn't very powerful though.

This one is 50x optical zoom, which has helped me create some great close up shots of far away scenes and birds.Both my former cameras were plagued by slow shutter lag, so the picture I took was sometimes not the picture I got, and then the recovery time before I could take the next shot was too slow for wildlife or aviation shots.This camera has a quick shutter and very fast recovery time so I can take the next shot quickly. No longer do I take a shot of  bird and then realize that the bird has flown off before the camera shows anything in the viewfinder again. Now I can take a shot of the bird, and then take a shot of the same bird lifting off.Sometimes when you are at maximum zoom, it could be hard to find what you were looking at because you may have moved the camera, but the Canon helps solve that problem by supplying a button that will zoom out to a wider field momentarily so you can find the subject again, and then it zooms back in.

The addition of a RAW option completes this experience for me. You would spend many thousands of dollars get\u00acting a similar optical zoom hooked onto your DSLR body for similar effects. Admitted this is a Powershot point-and-shoot camera and as such its sensor has its limitations. You are not going to get the visual clarity of a T3i, T4i, T5i, etc. But for a relatively inexpensive zoom \"bridge\" camera, this does the job quite nicely. I am especially pleased with the battery capability. Prior models have required AA's, but the lighter, proprietary battery makes the SX50 much lighter to tote. I picked up several extra batteries on line for cheap and they work just well as the official Canon ones. Optical stabilization is very helpful, especially when using the lens out to its full zoom lengths. Digital zoom is fun to play with, but you don't use it for anything other than seeing the moons of Jupiter (which I have done). The vari-angle LCD is a little bigger and makes shooting in the dark much easier.  The drawbacks?  It has a slower lens that some others in this category, so low light photography is not so great. Considering its other features, though, it's a bargain for what Canon has packed into it. After almost a year's use, it's still my favorite.

I can see objects in my pics that were not visible to the naked eye. The only negative comment I have to say regarding this incredible camera is that Canon should have kept the use of AA batteries as opposed to the propriatery Canon 10L Lithium Ion battery. I overcame this handicap by purchasing 2 more stand-by batteries. I would not want to be out on a shoot and run out of juice. I doubt this is going to happen with a total of 3 batteries on board.I have decided to keep my old Canon as it is still a gr8 camera and a nice back-up to my New and totally awesome SX50 HS. I've been into photography for a long time. I remember having a mirrored Rokor 300mm fixed focus lens and I thought it was awe inspiring.

I bought it for Christmas and I am a big fan of the zoom.I took a picture of a Kingfisher which I saw land on a tree way in the distance.  I could only see it with my binoculars. I pointed the camera in the same direction and zoomed in.  The focus was excellent and I was able to crop the photo on the computer to get a really close sharp picture. I was delighted with the result.I mainly photograph wildlife, especially birds, in good light. I haven't had the need to bother with anything in low light.I've had many different cameras over the years, all with attachable lenses, but now I have severe arthritis in my hands it's impossible for me to deal with all the extra equipment.  This camera is ideal for my situation. It's light to carry and easy to manage and I'm very happy with the results.However, on the negative side, I don't like the push button to switch it on and off.What was Canon thinking NOT to include the lead for the camera?  For we, who own the previous model it's not a problem, but it seems very short sighted to ask someone to spend $400.00 plus, and then expect them to have to buy a lead.The SX50 includes a basic instruction book, but it would be nice to see the next model include both the lead and a proper instruction book.If you are used to a good solid camera,and can manage the extra lenses this is not for you, but for convenience and comfort, it's a nice little camera.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great if you don't own a full DSLR", "Author": "Word Seeker \"Jayne\"", "ReviewID": "R1EODEGDJTHL2K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really would havegiven this 3.5 stars, so keep that in mind. It's probably the best point and shoot I've ever used, dut it definitely won't replace my Nikon D5200.  The 50x zoom is fantastic. It also performs well under low light conditions. But for someone who is used to quickly adjusting focal length and focus, this camera is as slow as any other point and shoot with zooming in and out. I missed several good shots when I was out birding because of this. So don't plan on using it if you AND the subject are potentially moving. Then I tried it for an event at my church where lighting was less than ideal. The pics were great!So bottom line is: If you already use a little pocket point and shoot, this is a huge step up.

I have to admit, though, that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The SX50HS is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and x50 zoom! The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CMOS-type. That is just a number, but one that matters. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor, so this is pretty standard.It has a viewfinder, which most point & shoots don't. The ISO rating is 6400 which makes it work better in low light. You will see chromatic aberrations much before 6400. But you don't need this high ISO unless you specialize. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It has an external flash option, but the built-in flash should suffice under most situations. The LCD screen has a 461,000 resolution, which makes for convenient viewing. The camera allows RAW processing which would matter if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. The burst rate is 2.2 frames per second. This is a heavier camera weighing 595 grams. The weight is a function of the big zoom. Compared to other big zoom cameras, the weight is not excessive and certainly not a liability.Overall, nice camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search. That will also tell you more about what you want.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for long zooms, but", "Author": "Ken Drake \"KD\"", "ReviewID": "RF4FPLX3YK476", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Best Buy for two reasons, one they would price match Amazon and two the ease of returns. Now the price is even lower on Amazon in less than 10 days, so much for price matching.The Pros of the camera are this:1. The long reach of the zoom.2. The pictures are quite good for it being a bridge camera even when not using the zoom. I do use a DSLR and a NEX, so I would know.3. Auto mode functions great for my wife so she can use it.3. It supports RAW, more on this in cons.4. It does have a hot shoe a plusNow to the cons:1. Terrible menu layout. Some features aren't available in some modes.2. Low light and ISO performance well just aren't what I am used to with my NEX or my Sony SLT, but it is a bridge camera.3. The zoom tends to over shoot where I want it to stop at. This has happened a lot and it is annoying... I find myself trying to get the range correct and almost miss the shot.4. No USB cable, come on Canon this is a 300+ dollar camera and it was over 400 dollars to begin with.5 No RAW in Auto and some other modes, or I least I can seem to get it to do this.Overall I like the camera for bird shots and other long zoom shots, but I may return it an see what some of the other super zooms have to offer.

I went out past center field and was able to zoom in on my son while he was hitting, getting everything from the pitcher's arm slot to my son's reaction to the pitch.  I was able to get multiple shots of his swing from another location and was actually able to correct a flaw that had crept into it.  I also took some video of my daughter's band concert and was able to zoom while shooting video - truly amazing.  I read the negatives about low-light photography.

With a 50x optical zoom, the Canon SX50 HS could so easily be a \"Five Star No-Brainer\", but it misses the mark in several key places. Because of the number of extensive and well written reviews of this camera and its features, I'll simply give the bulk of my review in list form of pros and cons.What I Like- \"Holy Crap It's HUGE\" zoom- Very good image stabilization- Quick focus (when it works) and metering adjustments when snapping pics... no shutter lag at all- Very good quality bright light photos- Very good (for a super zoom) color in images- Did I mention the size of its zoom?What I Don't Like- Auto focus is sometimes quirky- 12 megapixel is a little on the low side... I'd think this camera would've merited 16 MP- Camera body is just a little small for a bridge super zoom camera- Placement of Movie Record, Self-Timer, and Trash buttons ensure you will occasionally press them by accident- Not the best indoor shots (you don't want to go above ISO 800 with the SX50)- Fold out LCD can get in the way- Auto focus assist light blinds subjects, even from 15 feet away- Doesn't use standard AA batteriesThe focusing problem is my biggest issue with this camera so far.  Sometimes the camera will focus on a small object, and sometimes it will focus on the background. For example, I recently tried zooming in on a bluebird sitting on a fence post and it took several attempts before the camera would focus on the bird and not the foliage behind it, even though the bird nearly filled the screen. I ended up having to put the camera in full-time auto focus, get it to focus on the base of the fence post where it met the ground, and then move center frame up the pole until I had my bird centered.In conclusion, I'd be in heaven if I could take the best qualities of this camera (mainly the zoom) and combine them with the best of my old Fuji HS 10. Obviously that isn't possible, so the question really is, if I had a \"do-over,\" would I buy this camera again? The answer is, with a little reservation, yes. Most of the faults of the camera are things I can overcome, and I'm sure with a little time, I will learn to adjust my shooting technique to minimize them.The bulk of my photography is wildlife (mostly birds) and landscapes, so the zoom on the SX50 is perhaps the most important feature for my type of photography. If I did a lot of indoor photography I might think twice about making this my camera of choice. If I were shooting a  high school wrestling tournament or basketball game, this would not be the camera I'd want in my bag, in spite of what the zoom would do for my shots.", "Date": "March 17,

take bird pictures. I previously owned a Nikon P500 and I had some concerns with that camera, I noticed that picture color was a little bit pale. Also, the camera took some time to buffer after shooting a few pictures in continue mode (I missed a lot of shots because of this). I got rid of my Nikon and I bought a Canon Powershot SX50. There are a couple of things I had to get used to: the camera body (feels different from my Nikon) and buttons layout is also different.  I don't see that much of a difference in terms of zoom range (optical from 36X Nikon to 50X Canon)  however I notice that picture color is richer and buffering time after shooting HQ pictures in burst mode is outstanding. I have shot a few pictures in Raw and although it is a little bit slower than taking pictures in Jpeg I like the picture quality in Raw better. Video seems fine but since it is not my primary use I haven't spent time using it. Image Stabilization does a great job. Another reason I decided to buy this camera was because you can expand the camera settings by using CHDK (Beta version at this moment). I was able to take a few star pictures with an Exposure of 30 seconds, ISO 400 and an Aperture of 3.56. There are more options (time lapse, motion detection...) but I have not tried them yet.Approximate distance for most of the pictures on the video review 12 Ft.

Venugopal", "ReviewID": "R363OFNW4EPQ0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want a camera to capture a steady picture of your kid on stage, or in a marching band, and you're standing far away from the action, this is it. Birding and wildlife enthusiasts will love this camera.The image stabilization is top notch. For comparison, I own a pair of Celestron 20x binoculars. I have to hold it extremely steady to see the sky, and even then there is a fair amount of shake. With the SX 50, I was able to photograph the moon, craters and all, with simple handholding. I didn't even brace myself.I can see this being my every day camera, which I use on vacation or when visiting an interesting spot. What this isn't, is a camera that can help you with your photographic pursuits. Some drawbacks are that sharpness is lost at higher ISO levels starting as early as 1600. if you look closely on long zoom photos, some objects have a purple fringe. And the lens has a limited aperture range. You cannot take wide-aperture portrait photos that blur the background, as you can with an SLR. I wasn't very pleased with low-light performance when compared with my four year old Sony Alpha DSLR.This camera makes a great complement to a DSLR. With a DSLR you get a bigger sensor, larger aperture and finer control. With this, you get the zoom, built-in image stabilization, and something you can carry around more easily.Update: After a couple months of owning this, I still like it. Its my go-to camera. There are a few caveats though... the first is that in low light, this does not even come close to even an APS-C DSLR. The size of the sensor on this is much smaller, and there is correspondingly a lot of noise at low light/high ISO. Another thing is that ISO 6400 is a disappointment. I love to take pictures in available light, and to get a better shutter speed, ratchet up the ISO. When I go all the way to 6400, the pictures don't come out very good. The noise reduction within the camera removes a lot of detail.The second caveat is that the range of apertures is fairly limited (3.4 through 8, IIRC). Reduces the number of creative things you can do with this camera, but of course it opens up many other possibilities.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted", "Author": "E. J.

The only remedy I found was to take the battery out, wait about a minute, then put it back in and it would usually retract the lens. It would only fully retract when the lens was fully set at 24mm wide angle setting. I would expect a camera with a zoom should be able to retract the lens at any optical extension. So I'm sending this one back and getting a different camera. I found out that \"Lens Error\" is very common with Canon Powershots and that Canon typically blames it on user error (like dust, sand, or dropping it). I had done none of this and it happened right out of the box. Yes, this camera may have been defective, but I don't want to take the chance that replacing it with an identical one wouldn't do the same 6 months from now.It's such a shame because I was able to take an amazing picture of the moon last night ([...]).

I think that if a product requires a special fitting like this, that it should be included with the product.2:  The lens cap is totally awkward to take off and put on because the clip is located near the center of the cap, rather than on the sides where it could be easily pressed (as in earlier Canon SLRs which I used for a number of years and never had a problem with).3:  The on-off button is not well located and difficult to press (a sliding switch would have been much better).4:  The flash unit does not automatically pop up when it is needed, rather has to be manually lifted before use.5:  While I like saturated colors for my photos (and this unit can be set in program mode to do so), there is only one setting and I find that it is too much saturation.  The Kodak camera that I am replacing with this one has a choice of three degrees of saturation.6:  Although I've had the camera for a month now, I haven't been able to test the long-range focus, which some people have complained about.7.  The same day as this Amazon.com request for a rating arrived, I received a notice that there is a problem with the rubber viewfinder on certain models of this camera, and it happens to apply to mine, so now I have to return the unit to Canon in order to have this repaired.  Fortunately, the weather in my area happens to be dismal just now and I won't need it for a while yet.8:  All in all, the camera is a huge disappointment.  Canon no doubt thinks that the more buttons, dials, and switches, and settings the camera has, more people will like it because it makes them (the user) think they are smart.

Simplicity is always a wiser choice.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Amazing Camera!", "Author": "firefly", "ReviewID": "R3B762OZIDUBTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i don't usually use such descriptive words for products, but this camera is simply and truly amazing.My background: An amateur/hobby photographer for 35+ years. Do mostly landscapes and birds/wildlife. Started with a Pentax film camera years ago, then went to Nikon. So I am very familiar with adjusting F-Stops, shutter speed, etc., to get a good pic. Took many courses on photography over the years. Traveled around, years of some pretty great photos. Fought the change to digital, but finally gave in about five or six years ago. The digital Nikon SLR I have now is about five years old, and the auto focus always gave me problems with birds. Bought a Nikon \"advanced\" P&S; (similar to this) about three years ago. Same problem, plus the quality of pictures were never quite up to snuff no matter what I tried. Though I have a 400mm lens with the SLR, still isn't enough for birds much of the time. Along the way, bought three Panasonic P&S.; Fabulous pictures every time! Was set to buy latest Panasonic like this Canon....then they took away Leica lens, and build them in China. That was the end of that.This is one terrific camera. I've been taking loads of shots the last three weeks. I purposely have not even done anything in the way of making \"adjustments\" other than to adjust the exposure, just to see how good it is, or where it may be weak. That's it. The 1200mm lens is unbelieveable. No camera shake whatsever....although, I will have to say that if you are not steady, you may want to use a tripod at that length. It IS possible to get a great handheld shot at that length, but you must be steady enough to do it. Where I live we have high winds almost all the time, so it's a bit of a challenge! But I managed to get some fantastic shots despite it. (And mind you, I'm very particular about what is acceptable vs. what has a real \"wow\" factor.)Adjusting the exposure, which is easy to do quickly, allowed me to get terrific closeup shots of many birds (think always-on-the-move palm warblers and hummingbirds, goldfinches in flight!) in low light conditions and on overcast days (of which we have had far too many lately).The macro is also terrific. I always had a hard time getting good closeup shots of flowers with any of my other cameras. This one is right on. I'm really impressed with the results, with no lenses to change out!The crispness and clarity of the shots I've taken is amazing beyond belief. Color is right on. I am still in awe of this camera. I may never buy another SLR!  I can take this birding with me, too, and not have to lug around a heavy SLR. That way I can watch the birds and still hope to get a few good shots along the way!I have medium size hands, and the camera feels very good to hold and manuever. The moveable LCD screen is great. I've not had one before. You can use it to shoot (I prefer the viewfinder....a big reason why I got this type of camera), or it works really well to review a shot. The viewfinder has a diopter, so you can adjust it to your eyesight. You can actually see the LCD screen very well outside (unlike any other digital camera I've had before).Only drawback is that I worry about the card/battery latch at the bottom of the camera. It is not a rigid/tough plastic, and I'm not sure why they cheaped out on it. Though, in reality, if it should pop open or break off for some reason, the battery and card will not just fall out (they are secured). Also, I do wish it had a Landscape setting. My Panasonic has that, and it's great. Not a big deal; I simply put it on Landscape and adjust the exposure accordingly. I have more flexibitiliy in getting the shot I want that way anyway.Canon has a new fan! I've been told by my photographer/birder friends for years Canon was the way to go. Why didn't I listen?Be sure to always have an extra. fully-charged battery on hand. I have been shooting a lot of pictures lately over a span of a few hours, and the battery usually does go out during that time and I have to change it out.

I was skeptical to say the least. But its true, its a long neck reach into the 1200mm range.Although I have 4 DSLR's already, and a slew of lenses, the small size of the camera coupled with the talked of the fast focus made me want it.I like to travel with the smallest lightest equipment when I do street photography and or travel. I need a camera that can keep up with me in all light conditions. A camera that can shoot very fast FPS. This camera shoots 10 frames per second. The onboard lens is a 24-1200mm (35mm). Quite a focal length. The aperture ranges from wide at f/3.4 to zoomed out of f/6.5. What this tells me is that you will need lots of light when you use the longest reaches of the lens. The optical zoom has a button of the left side of the camera body that helps refocus the image when you are zoomed to the maximum. But again, this features works best when outdoors in strong light, indoors its not effective, resulting in blurred images.I also bought the YN 560II, an all manual flash for $60 here on Amazon. It outperforms higher priced Canon speedlites. The best feature is the \"slave\" mode, for off camera flash photography. You can use the on board or built in flash to trigger the YN 560II to fire at will. The YN 560II, was surprising good. In fact the flash is so large that it makes the Canon SX50 appear even smaller.Cons: Low battery life, about 250 images on one charge. Buy extra batteries. Won't last a full day of shooting. Slow to process in continuous burst mode. The self timer button area should be moved. I have hit it by accident several times when using the mode dial. The on and off button should be placed near the front of the camera. The image review, and on and off power button, are too close for me. Macro settings are only in preset shoot mode. You can still get very close with the non macro option. The flash use is very odd. You have to manually flip up the built in flash. The flash icon on the side is for flash options only.Overall image quality is okay, nothing super. The camera has trouble focusing in the longer focal lengths. A tripod helps and the more light you have the better this all works.Pros: Small and compact body. Durable, light weight. Fast auto focus. 24-1200mm great for all around picture taking. Intuitive menu options. Great quality video at 1080p. Good audio quality.  24-1200mm (35mm Equivalent) Lens  50x Optical Zoom  12.1MP CMOS Sensor  DIGIC 5 Image Processor (Same as Canon 5d MKIII)  2.8\" Vari-Angle LCD with Viewfinder  Full HD 1080p Video with Stereo Sound  Optical Image Stabilizer  High Speed AF Focuses in 0.19 sec  High-Speed Burst HQ for 13fps Shooting  Built-in Hot ShoeEmail with any questions.Cheers!", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "canon Power Shot SX50", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3LZPO9S84ISCQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did not not like this camera.

My other bird camera, the Nikon P-510 is a great camera but doesn't have the reach of the Canon at the telephoto end.  However, the Canon's focusing ability is greatly reduced when shooting thru a window at my hummingbird feeder.  Perhaps manual focus might work but the birds are so fast that time is often only in seconds.  It doesn't have an ability to accept filters.  One has to buy a filter adaptor kit  from Vivitar or Wal-Mart.  My Vivitar kit includes a collapsible hood and three filters: UV, polarizer and sky filter.

After practicing getting used to how it works (we only did auto setting) we both found this camera to be great for nature photography. We got some great closeups of birds and animals. The zoom is very convenient as it is placed right by the shutter button, and can be dialed in and out with one finger without taking your eye off the object. The camera also did well with scenery & close ups.An additional feature we liked is that it is relatively light weight and does not have the bulky, long lense to weigh one down.The one feature we did not like was the eye viewer.  The object was always blurry  and it was hard to tell what kind of photo would result.  Often the picture was clear, but the blurr was annoying. I've found in sunny situations that the eye viewer generally works better that the screen which exacerbates the blurr problem.The screen viewer was great always clear and can be manuvered several ways to help in picture taking.In general we liked this camera and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon power shot sx50hs for kids and general photo", "Author": "kmyo", "ReviewID": "R2PU55ZY2093TW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this camera is convenience to shoot general events like playing kids or birds or festival etc..Photo quility is good enough for general use.

For pro photographer this one is really nice to play for personal use. For general people it is lot of fun using this camera. For someone who want to learn photography don't buy this, buy basic DSLR.ISO and noise handling is good and I got some nice bird photo but I would like to point out some facts. It need a lot of lights for zoom. If subject is in the shade you could get noisy and blur image. If subject is 45 degree or so against the bright light you could get most part blow out image with chromatic aberration, hight light cliping. Anyway you have chances to get nice bird photo with this lens. Practice using tripod and play around with IS disable. Sometime focus doesn't work properly, using auto mode and zooming a subjects in full size filling the frame, focus doesn't work and keep hunting in enough bright light and distance. You can take macro  close up without using zoom. If you use zoom it could not focus in certain distance.F stop is very limited f4.5 ~ f8. You can't go further than f8.Built quality is normal.

So put this all in context.As with many others, I bought this camera primarily for the zoom.  I use it mostly outdoors while on bird-watching ventures.  Up through the end of the optical range (50x), I've been quite pleased with the picture quality.  Digital zooms have always been gimmicks and they're no different with this camera.  The digital range goes from 50x to 100x and the picture quality in that range is so poor it isn't worth using.  That said, it's impressive what you can get through the optical range with this point and shoot.  The biggest issue I've had outdoors with the zoom in program mode is getting it to focus on the right thing when there are multiple objects at different depths in the field of view.  This isn't new to this camera but is an ongoing one I have with point and shoot cameras.  Assuming you are able to get your object in focus, the focus-lock feature on this camera is useful in maintaining it.  I give the zoom a B+.Though I didn't get the camera for movie purposes, they've been a very pleasant surprise.  The HD movies you're able to get, even at the high end of the zoom range, are simply fantastic whether you're viewing them on your computer or your large flatscreen TV.  Sound capture with the movies is quite good as well.  I give the movie feature an A.Image stabilization on the camera is excellent.  I've taken quite a few pictures in very windy conditions and, even at the high end of the optical zoom, I don't notice any degradation of image quality compared with conditions with no wind.My knocks on the camera would include the array of buttons on the back.  I continue to inadvertently turn on the self-timer feature in the midst of shooting.  Finally, though I love the zoom and movie features, I'm a bit disappointed in the overall crispness of pictures.  I was expecting a just a bit more, and I agree with others that the camera doesn't function well without very full light.Overall, a solid B+.

Keep your expectations low and avoid comparison with DSLR features and shots.Having used this Camera for one more week I can say it does take good pictures in bright sunlight.

I researched heavily before I chose this camera and I haven't been disappointed.  First the pros:  pretty good design with nice hand-feel, but I wish it came with a wrist strap.  The flash doesn't pop up automatically, which for me is a pro because I often prefer the light effect with no flash, but if this concerns you, not to worry, it does let you know when it would prefer to use the flash.  The recording feature with HDMI video is a nice feature which I have frequently used.  you can also snap pics while recording, but you should note that it does pause the video for a second with a still shot.  The zoom can't be beat.  When you are zoomed all the way out you will need a tripod or at the least, have the camera sitting on something, but the shots I got of the moon are unreal.  The pics in general come out beautiful.  Fantastic color and richness.  The option for grouping shots on action mode is also nice.  My biggest con of this camera is that some features are buried in menus making them cumbersome to access.  Also, I wish it was more obvious when you are looking through your shots what is video and what is a pic.  More than once, I've been going too fast and deleted something that I thought was a pic, when it was a video.

The aperture range for the SX40 was f2.7-f5.8, but it gets considerably slower for the SX50: f3.4-6.5. I wonder to how much zoom is to much. I think it's a marketing tool.

I didn't even bother to take a single picture with it when, after charging the battery and firing it up, I realized that Canon had eliminated a bunch of basic choices in its Scene settings.  ie.:  landscape, night landscape, landscape with portrait, beach, foliage, etc.  Now, I realize that turning the dial to Auto is likely to produce the same type of photo that I would have achieved if I had those scene settings to choose from, but I assume they are there for a reason on the older models, and I wasn't happy that they were gone.  I found it disconcerting that they kept fireworks (a setting that will get used once a year) but got rid of landscape, which I bet people use 50% of the time.

After trying it in all differents modes and settings, and after reading the user's manual ( which i had to download because it is NOT included). Please, i would like to mention this: Don't blame me if you LOVE this product and disagree with something i will post here. I am rating this product according to what i found on it, either good or bad. I am giving 2 stars.I like the image quality in low-light, with NO flash. In these conditions camera focused faster than i spected it, despite the annoying AF lamp, which is annoying if you want to shoot a person's face, this wide beam of light will illuminate the whole face. If you turn off this AF lamp ( light) camera may not focus precisely.I bought this camera mainly because its RAW capability, and the hot shoe for an external flash. Well, RAW files are CR2 files rather than RAW, and i couldn't open them with photoshop elements 11, as i did with other  real RAW files.Build in flash doesn't pop up automatically, you need to raise it manually. Flash makes a loud \"slapping\" sound when fired.Saturacion, and Contrast are not in the main menu, but hidding in a \"My colors\" sub menu.Aperture is limited from 3.5  to only 8.0Max shutter speed is limited to 1/2000.Poor battery life, about 200 pictures, taken the same day with a full charged battery. Charged the same morning.AWB is awful for portraits, needs to be fine tune reducing the skin tone in \"My colors\" sub-menu. Or you won't get  a natural looking skin tones.And the most childish feature is the \"lens reatract\" .  Yes, if you already have some pictures and you want to view them, you switch to playback mode, the lens will retract either inmediately or after 1 minute, it depends on how you set it on the menu. You have no choice, and this is NOT a malfuntion but a ridiculous feature. After the lens retracts, you can still view your pictures, but when you are done, you would have realize tha the camera is actually off. Now you have to turn it back on if you want to take more pictures or play with the menu, or do something else with this camera.This is not fixed by turning off the power saving mode, ( which turns off the camera after certain time of inactivity).This is a different feature.In Manual mode, the camera sets the ISO to 80, if you set the shutter speed, at 1\"3. The camera won't let you set a higher ISO.There is NO user manual, NO cables, NO hot shoe cover anymore like the previous sx40.You will love this camera if you like the huge 50x zoom, in addition 4x digital zoom for a total of 200x.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not sharp pictures.", "Author": "Charlene", "ReviewID": "R1MSPG8VWI5AB9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera especially for its 1200 mm zoom...but the sensor in the camera can not handle the zoom.

Incredible zoom at an incredible price.  But what is real cost?  50x zoom --- is this really needed?  (Don't forget the ability to crop.)  Not by many.  Indeed, Canon opted for zoom at the expense of lens speed.  That is, the already zoom far enough for near anyone SX40 (about 35x) has a faster lens (check it out).  Comparing the two cameras the SX40 seems to shoot better indoors, too (not as dark).  On the other hand, this camera is a bit smaller and more elegant.  It is also very fast to zoom and can do about 10fps under certain conditions.  It has RAW --- anyone really going to use that on this?Near fatal flaw --- terrible viewfinder (I believe 202,000 pixels) --- would, say, 600,000 pixels have cost too much?  Almost useless and needed if one is super-zooming (less blur when held to nose rather than using the smallish LCD.  The noonday winter (much less later in the day winter sun) ruins shots and is unpleasant to use.  This price cutting (I'm assuming it is not a size issue) is  annoying and silly on such a camera --- charge $20 more.  As a comparison my Nikon D5100 (a DSLR) has an easy to read viewfinder in the same sunlight.  My venerable FZ35 even has a better viewfinder !!!  Get some dough ready for a new tripod :-).Very good for pics on a sunny day (especially in the summer) --- surprisingly sharp --- the IQ is great.  Indoor pics much harder.Will try and update to see if this camera warrants 4 stars (and is better than the SX40).Too bad they did not keep the prior lens and let us enjoy the relative speediness of this lens.  I mean, 35x is good enough for me, and I don't need bragging rights.The FZ200 is probably the one to get --- less zoom, better video, great lens (2.8 at any zoom) and more pixels in the viewfinder.  If the same price, I would have obtained the FZ200.UPDATE:It's close but I'm upgrading this to 4 stars.  Compared to the Nikon P500, it seems much better.  The P500 has trouble focusing at full zoom, a smaller battery, and, of course, a smaller zoom range (20x - 40x is enough for me).  The SX50 is better than the P500 indoors and out and with more use, I believe it is overall better than the SX40.  IS seems a bit better, the LCD seems a bit better, and so on.  IQ, with practice, better than expected.  No, it is not a D5100 or even a G15 in terms of IQ, but that's to be expected.Four stars is still a bit difficult.  It's priced at about $399 while the D3100 with a good kit lens is about $499.  Better value:  D3100 in my opinion.  Also, that viewfinder remains terrible (the same one is found on the SX40).  Of course, the D3100 has a much better one.  But even the FZ200 megazoom has a much better one with more than 1 million pixels.

The closest comparable ones were a Nikon P40? with 40 or 45x zoom, which was horrible and a Fuji that could get 30x. The Fuji was mediocre but could pull off some nice photos and could get pretty clear shots of planes very high in the sky without a hellish amount of blurred shots. It wasn't great for long distance for some reason when it came to people and scenery, but just a little above okay so that it was website worthy. I only used the Nikon one for a few minutes, I left a review for it, but since amazon has repeatedly banned me my accounts are fragmented and it skews how my review habit actually is and my score (and they relentlessly spam me and use my affiliate links anyways, very honorable of them huh - banned for \"an extraordinary amount of refunds\" by the way, read the boycott I made on boycottowl.c0m for more on that extraordinary claim). Anyways.2) Excellent zoom and resolution. Ironically this was nearly the reverse of the Fuji, even with 20x more zoom far away pictures of planes are blurry, then again the sun was nearly down and I only got a few shots, most of which were blurred. I used it on people that were far away and the blurring was minimal and I could see their faces clearly unlike with the Fuji which at it's best could only pull off muddyish features at 30x, and just about useless at night.3) Night video was very useable and much much better than any other camera I've used to record night video except this Sanyo cam that you hold like a gun, I forget, which could amplify light tremendously, especially for photos at the cost of making everything appear to be golden and muddy and grainy. But the Canon had no such muddy or grainyness, but as I said, I couldn't force it to up the ISO. Maybe messing with the exposure would have done something but I haven't tried it yet as it's not the easiest control system.4) It seems to have a level so you can know if the camera is parallel with the ground/horizon or not, cool! I was actually wondering why no camera had a physical level like the kinds that have a bubble in them.Negatives:1) I can't figure out how to adjust the iso on video, there appears to be no way to change it.2) No manual focus control, which isn 99.99 percent of the case with all point and shoot cams.3) I found the control ring confusing as it not only allows manipulation through the use of a dial ring, but the usual cross way button pressing. At one point when I switched to manual and macro and got the iso where I wanted, the screen kept turning white, so I was forced to switch modes and found messing with the exposure put a stop to that. For some reason in macro mode on manual I couldn't change the exposure significantly, and at one point told me I could do such and such because the shutter speed was too slow (I'm less than an photo amateur so I didn't understand what that meant, and yes, I've heard of F stop, and don't bother telling me I don't want lessons through amazon comments.)4) What little I used of the the dynamic range, and it was only a little, didn't look impressive to me and you had to keep the camera very still. This in contrast to some new Panasonic point and shoot cam (which was terrible) which came out with an amazing HDR photo when I wasn't even intending it and not exactly keeping the camera still, though I was sitting down unlike when I was using the SX50 for HDR. I was bending over and pointing it close up at a rock, and it made some sort of shaking camera symbol on the bottom and in the middle indicating to not shake the camera. I couldn't see any way to turn the anti-shake on.5) The lens already has a faint scratch on it, about half a quarter of an inch maybe, as far as I know I've not scratched it with a rock, the only thing that would have done that is an incredibly small grain in the form of dust.

However I just wanted a small camera that I could take to Africa and take some wild animal pictures. The specifications certainly made me think this was the camera. It would be small enough so that not a lot of space would ben necessary and with the zoom lens I could get some close ups of the wild game. Did the camera perform as advertised?First my photos are most disappointing. Thank goodness I took along my Nikon D-90 from which I got some great photos. My photos are not professional quality and more than likely just above candid snap shots.The camera is small and you will immediately notice this once you put it in your hand. If you have large fingers you are going to find the controls rather awkward and even the place where your right thumb fits on the back of the camera is small and my large thumb kept getting in the way and effecting the cameras settings. The zoom in switch is located on the right  at the front of the camera and once again if your fingers are large you may encounter a challenge.The camera has a fixed lens that is advertised as a 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 50X wide angle optical image stabilized zoom. Too often I let the optical portion of the lens go beyond  the optical limits to the digital and that was a total disaster. Even at the 50X mark I found that my pictures were not clear and clean. The lens is fixed therefore you cannot change lens. This is basically the same kind of snap shot camera one buys to slip in one's pocket so you always have a camera handy.  However this camera is too large to slip into your pocket. I think this would make a nice camera for a child as a first camera. It does have a screen on the back which rotates and a viewfinder and viewfinders seem to be a thing of the past unless you go into a higher priced products. I missed some really good big game shots due to using the optical and digital lens Zoom. The photos will be find if I limit my prints to 4 X 6 but trying the enlarge them is a complete disaster.The camera write up claims that you can imagine getting right down on the filed to capture sports action, zeroing in on your child's expression on a crowded stage and recording elusive wildlife shots. It's a good write up but one that certainly did not happen with me. If one would take the time and put this camera on a  tripod and then use appropriate filters you can more than likely get some good shots in what I would call a mid range area. Just don't do like I did and try to capture moving shots at 100 yards. That tri-pod will help with the stabilization. If you want to take some close up snapshots then don't worry about the stabilization and shoot away. You will get some really great \"snap shots\".The image stabilized zoom will actually help stabilize your shot if you don't have the zoom extended too much. Go all the way to 50X and that is another story. The specks refer to a \"Zoom Framing Assist\" that will help you track your subject even a long distance away. This is true to some extent. Once again don't do like I did and try to extend the zoom too far as that little square will simply move all over the place. Perhaps with a lot of practice you could get this function working better than I did.I am certainly not giving up my Nikon and will stay with inter changeable lens mounts for the future.

It can take a clear detailed focused picture of a knats ass at 100 yards. Has a super powerful processor with Canons latest technology same used in higher end canon DSLR camera's quick autofocus through out the zoom lenses range. Great low light abilities unless you want to stay up all night taking a long exposure shot of the moon. Raw format available too. Made in Japan hello! This is really a great camera!!!. The one star is only because no USB cord is supplied with camera kit. You can take professional photos with this camera but It don't do you any good if you kan't download it to your computer or printer.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but no cord to connect to computer?", "Author": "Liz H.
