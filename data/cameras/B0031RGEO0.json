The pictures look great, not only in the computer or when I print them at home. They look just super when I reproduce them at the photoshop or supercenter. And it looks real great. People ask me for the camara when they see it or see the pictures. It's like a professional camara that you don't have to do nothing but shoot the picture. The battery life is very good too.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent item", "Author": "Bill \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R20Q7BAJC68WH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent product for the intended use and cost.  Only thing to consider is that it seems to consume AA batteries rather fast but keeping a good supply on hand solves that problem.

I've had various cameras before. This is by far the least expensive camera I've ever bought, but not the least in quality. This camera takes good pictures, especially when there is a well lit area. In low light it's not as good, but I take most of my pictures outside anyways. So, I suggest that if you are getting this for a vacation or mostly outdoor pictures, it's a really great choice. Oh yeah, and it's a great price too! I would definitely recommend this camera to a someone I know. This camera has a lot of features, and honestly, it's not that hard to figure them out. I'm definitely not an expert at figuring out these things most of the time, but I just played around with it for about 20 minutes and I know how to use about 35 different things already. This can be a very fun camera to own. The blue is a little darker than the one shown in the pictures, but it actually looks nicer. If you want a camera under 100 dollars, this is, in my opinion, a great great choice.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice one.", "Author": "Srivatsan \"srisathyam\"", "ReviewID": "R21NEE6YXRH72U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My in-laws seem to like this cam..

We are average camera users who take pictures of our daily lives--kids, friends, travels, random every day objects (kids' toys set ups, flowers outside, frost on the grass, etc...), food, etc... WE are not at all professional.TOO SLOW: Talk about major delay when pressing the shutter button. Everyone's smiles become fake (held too long). It takes 3-4 shots to get the right one. And by that time, everyone (if it's a small or big group pictures) is done. Not a great camera for candid moments. By the time the pictures are taken, the moments were already missed. You pretty much have to plan to take 2 seconds ahead to get the picture you want. But that's impossible for candid shots. I have awesome cameras that take the picture as SOON as you click (Kodak EasyShare V610 and Canon Digital Rebel XSi).TOO BRIGHT: On AUTO MODE--- Hardly did I get a nice normal picture. MOST are TOO BRIGHT or TOO DARK. My husband HATED it. He couldn't believe how terrible this camera is. He my picture of what he got me for Christmas and couldn't believe how blurry and bright it was. Not too mention I'm sitting still.TOO BLURRY:  14MP really?  more like less than 6MP.  Moving kids---FORGET IT. Still objects--TERRIBLE! Forget about thinking of blowing up the picture to bigger than 4x6. If it's blurry on review mode, it will be blurry on print (hard copy). Blurriness goes for video mode as well. NO ANTI-SHAKE CAPABILITIES....NO ZOOM on VIDEO mode:  Before taking a video, you have to focus your camera, by letting it sit on the object you're about to take a video of (VERY HARD when it's moving objects like kids. TERRIBLE since that's what video mode is all about anyways--MOVEMENT. If you record and the pictures are blurry to begin with, the video will be blurry all throughout the takes. When the pictures are decently clear, then that's when you click record (shutter button). Then I found out NO ZOOM on video mode, so you pretty much have to follow your object around. I was taking a video of our son riding his new scooter around the backyard. The zoom on video mode while it's on WOULD've been NICE.THIS CAMERA IS EXHAUSTING TO WORK WITH. IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE.
