Although I wished the design were slightly different: the electrical prongs could be on the other end -- when I take out the battery, it's easy to inadvertently pull the whole charger from the socket.  But otherwise, a very useful product!", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Halcyon Batteries for FUJIFILM X-S1", "Author": "Don Lewis \"sperrier\"", "ReviewID": "RI853BLNDJ78I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The price is right and I have had good results from other after-market camera batteries.  Too soon to tell until I have several charge cycles on them.  I needed a car charger also, so that was handy. Fits into the camera well; no problem being too thick as some others are.Good so far.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fuji x100s batteries DO fit in this charger.", "Author": "Dan Murano", "ReviewID": "RWHFF330IQZLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Charging is a little slow (same as the Fuji charger), but they seem to last a long time. I'm glad I bought this - I had bought a different brand and had to tape the batteries down because they didn't fit in the charger - The Fuji batteries fit in this one.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DELJT1S"}}
