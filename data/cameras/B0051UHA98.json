This camera has a lot of the features that my DSLR has and much more than my cell phone camera has. The quality of the photos are really good. Sorry but I haven't used the video function of the camera yet.

Instead of buying a Rebel or Nikon DSLR, she said \"16MP will take good pictures!\"  I told her she was crazy, but I have to say that I was really impressed by some of the shots she took.  Will this ever stand up to a high level camera? OF COURSE NOT! Apples and oranges.  But - this camera holds its own in this class and is phenomenal at sub $169.99", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Deal", "Author": "joseph roger porter", "ReviewID": "R2FAPRH23WGLW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Direct Deals came through for me.

While I am walking through New York City or running in the Adirondack mountains I enjoy taking pictures. The quality is excellent and a 3GB memory card can hold more than enough pictures. The price of $100 is exceptional and the size makes it very easy to place it in my pants pocket for that quick picture. I highly recommend the Panasonic DMC-FH7 Lumix.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent camera!", "Author": "Sergio", "ReviewID": "R2TDK0NMOOMKW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very satisfied about it, is cheap and his features are excellent. the best option in the market for a hundred dollars!", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3-inch Smart Touch Screen, enabling Touch Auto Focus (AF), Touch Zoom, Touch Shutter and Intelligent Scene Selector\n28mm wide-angle LEICA DC lens with an impressive 4x optical image stabilized zoom\niA (Intelligent Auto) mode, making it easy for anyone to take great photos\nBeauty retouch mode\nIntelligent Scene Selector automatically selects the best option from: Macro, Portrait, Scenery, Night Portrait, Night Scenery and Sunset", "Name": "Panasonic DMC-FH7K 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom Touchscreen - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ton2URs7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0051UHA98"}}
