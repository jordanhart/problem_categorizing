Very slick little camera with lots of features.  Only drawbacks: 1. a memory card is not included in package; and, 2. there is no viewfinder other than generous LCD.  You can spend a lot more and get no more so why do so?", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the price", "Author": "JessicaS", "ReviewID": "R2GVEUPUWJ8P0H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to have a nice little point and shoot camera handy to take pictures of my child.  This camera takes the worst photos!  Everything is blurry no matter what setting I have it on.  It is also difficult to find just a standard photo setting.  The thing that bugs me the most about the camera is the slow shutter speed.  Every time I try to snap a photo, it takes 3 seconds before it takes.  I tried calling Samsung for assistance, and they were less than helpful. I would not recommend this camera.  Save the $ and put it towards something a little nicer.  The only plus, is the size.  It is easy to keep this in my purse.  Unfortunately, I would rather use my phone. We love other products by Samsung, too bad this camera isn't one of them.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value for it's price", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2HS1Y2HN49AU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great value for the price considering it's many features offered.

As a result, typical ambient lighting situations cause the camera to 'process' the image and leave it either under or over exposed. I've attempted to mess with all the setting to no avail -- if some strange combination works, then it defeats the purpose of a *simple* point-and-shoot camera anyway. This thing sucks. Don't buy it. Your money would be better spent on other items to torture yourself with.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Daughters Christmas Gift", "Author": "Brian Petrangelo", "ReviewID": "R26MA2MENEAALG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and decided not to review till now. The camera is perfect for a 14 year old. Features are easy to use and picture quality is high.Screen size is adequate but the one knock I have to give it is the outdoor shooting. Upper midwest winters and lots of snow produce some wonky photos because of glare. My daughter took or at least tried to take pictures outside at night with snow and they just don't come out right. The camera quality is great and I purchased Samsung because everything in our home is Samsung and you can't go wrong with the manufacturer.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks nice, good size, takes a nice clear photo on occasion but a lot of issues with blurry pictures", "Author": "Zoink", "ReviewID": "R154EKM8TXGXO7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is pretty small and a really nice colour.. it looks really cool.Initially I was happy with it, but noticed quite often it's hard to get a non blurry photo.
