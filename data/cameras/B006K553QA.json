{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More than I expected - Still!", "Author": "Fair Minded Guy", "ReviewID": "R1H0JX9QZMZPBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are a photo-purist, you will not like this camera. It does not take RAW images; there are no manual exposure controls (other than the ISO setting); and it lacks both a manual focus ring and the ability to switch-out $1,500 lenses. Add to this the fact that the camera applies a degree of in-camera processing to every shot taken and you pixel-peeping people will be outraged at the result when your images are blown-up to the football-field proportions that 18.2 megapixels affords. Maybe a D3 is the camera you need after all? Similarly, you geeky folks that wax lyrical of bells and whistles will be disappointed to learn that this camera does not do wi-fi, does not contain a GPS and, so far, I have not discovered any way to use it for sending text messages.If, on the other hand, like me, you accept up-front that the WX150 purports to be nothing more than a darn good 'point and shoot' camera, you will not be disappointed. The stats are there for all to see and, in the two weeks I have owned and used this camera, I have been more than happy with the performance. What is not there to see so obviously on amazon.com is that this camera feels sturdy and well-built, yet is small enough to fit into a cigarette packet. Battery life is excellent (250+ photos per charge, even with the $5.00 look-alike batteries); there is no (yes zero!) noticeable shutter-lag when not using the flash; and it is blazingly fast (getting from switch-on to 'ready' probably takes less than 2 seconds and when zooming/focusing it is almost instantaneous, rivaling DSLR's).Having switched off the battery-saving 'eco' option (which, in the default mode, annoyingly shuts-down the camera after one minute if no settings are changed) I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the WX150 at this stage. I will be back to update this review if I am subsequently disappointed by some as-yet-undiscovered weakness.July 25, 2012 - UpdateLooking at all the other reviews here, it seems I was wise to wait (as I did) several months for this camera to become available in the USA. I have now been using the WX150 for a further eight weeks and its performance as a truly 'pocket-sized' point and shoot continues to be hugely impressive. It could never compete with a mid/high-end DSLR, but I defy any DSLR user to find a better 'pocket alternative' at present.In addition to the 'core' camera features, I have recently been enjoying some new perspectives using the (pretty much 1-click) artistic settings. Initially, I thought I would have no use for these 'novelty' features, but the Watercolor and Line Drawing in-camera processing effects are producing some interesting and worthwhile shots. Neither did I anticipate using the video recording option, but I discovered that, (even at the lo-res MP4 setting), this camera takes high quality video indoors in ambient lighting conditions. The hi-res video consumes a lot of memory (of course), but the quality of both picture and audio are absolutely remarkable for a camera of this size ... now you'll have to buy a 55 inch TV from Amazon.com, just to see what I mean ;-)I would advise buyers to also get an external battery charger and an additional battery. The USB charging connection can be very convenient, but so too is being able to swap-out a battery and carry on shooting while the original recharges. The Wasabi batteries are working just fine for me. Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-BN1 and Cyber-shot DSC-T99, DSC-T110, DSC-TX5, DSC-TX7, DSC-TX9, DSC-TX10, DSC-TX20, DSC-TX55, DSC-TX66, DSC-TX100V, DSC-TX200V, DSC-W310, DSC-W320, DSC-W330, DSC-W350, DSC-W360, DSC-W380, DSC-W390, DSC-W...I would also strongly recommend installing a 16GB/32GB Class 10 SDHC, or better, memory card (to get the high-end performance from this camera, you cannot shackle it with a low-end memory card).We can expect broken battery/utility doors, damaged connectors and the occasional 'lemon' failure on miniature cameras such as this - only time will tell us whether these and other reliability features are any better or worse for this camera than they are for its peers. So far, so good, it seems.A photographer friend asked me the other day, \"What would be the one thing you would like to improve on the WX150\". He forced me to answer. After a few moments thought I replied that the one thing that I would personally like would be for the camera to provide a menu option to capture a RAW image in addition to the processed image. Don't get me wrong ... the image processor in this camera is astonishingly intelligent, but on the odd shot (less than one percent of the total) I would like to try my luck with some manual post-processing. This, despite what I said above - I guess there's still some geek in me after all :-)Mostly though, I am just loving the convenience of my WX150. You can pull this little camera out and be clicking away confidently in a couple of seconds. It is a joy to use and the resulting photographs can be posted, printed (to at least 8x10), or displayed anywhere SOOC (straight out of the camera).November 20, 2012 - UpdateA couple of quick notes to add my latest experiences ... Some may find this useful.On the negative side - despite keeping my WX150 protected at all times when not in use, a fleck of dust somehow became apparent on one of my lens elements, causing a slight shadow in the corner of photos taken at the mid-zoom range. On the positive side (and quite different to my lens problem experiences with Canon and Olympus in recent years) - Sony respected the warranty. The repair center cleaned and returned my camera within two weeks without charge. We all hope we do not have to return stuff under warranty, but when we do we expect to be treated like a valued customer, so this was a BIG plus for me.Also, I've changed my mind about what I would wish for (If I could have Sony improve one thing on this camera). I would ask for a more scratch-resistant display screen. Because it stands slightly proud of the casing, protective adhesive covers are pretty much useless (they quickly peel at the corners), consequently the surface of my display is now covered with small scratches (from general use and from carrying a spare battery around). Although still fine in use, this degrades the appearance of the camera. I fail to understand why it should be so delicate - the 3 year-old screen on my Blackberry has received severe abuse (it's even been kicked, spinning across a concrete station platform), but it has barely a mark on it. Alright, the phone sucks, but the screen is robust. Come on Sony - you can do better - this weakness is causing me to question whether I might invest in a more expensive camera from Sony.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for an upgrade from an older point and shoot", "Author": "B. Wueste", "ReviewID": "R3A5FKCAQG2Z5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're still using a point and shoot camera that's more than a few years old and you're tired of pushing the button and holding it down waiting forever for the damn thing to take a picture then this is a great next camera for you.Our old digital camera was fine for throwing in our pocket when we went on trips, but the shutter delay was so horrible that we'd miss fast paced moments or people would get tired of smiling as they hold a pose anxiously waiting for that flash. We had a few trips planned this summer and wanted an upgrade that would take clearer faster pictures generally for photo books and online viewing.I did TONS of research online and got all tangled up in megapixels and optical zoom and features that I probably would never use anyway. I'm not advanced enough to move up to a SLR camera, but I wanted something that was a step up from the camera I have now. After getting dizzy from all the online reviews I finally just went to some big box stores and played around with the cameras on display. I used them like I would use them on a trip and I even brought along my wife to make sure that she was comfortable using it.Based on the reviews I was all set to buy a Panasonic Lumix model, but there were too many dials and settings and it wasn't user friendly when actually holding and playing with the camera. I honestly hadn't even seen a review for this Sony WX150 camera, but it was so easy to use and was much smaller than some of the other \"travel zoom\" cameras. It has three basic modes that you could easily toggle with a button - camera, movie and panorama.Camera is where you spend most of your time and on here 95% of the time we live it on \"auto\". There are several scenes you can select if you want to optimize something for a specific setting. For example, if you're shooting through glass in low light you can set it to that it doesn't flash. If you're moving around a lot you can set it for extreme anti-blur where it takes like 5 pictures super fast and then puts them all together for a crisp image. Most importantly it's easy to toggle between the settings and you don't have to scroll through countless menu/info screens to find things.Panorama mode seems awesome when you read about it, but in practice it's been tough to get to actually work out well. The pictures always end up getting cut off pretty short. Maybe they'll look good on the computer when you blow them up, but on the camera screen it's a little disappointing.I haven't used movie mode yet so I can't speak to that feature.So this camera doesn't have GPS (which I think is just a battery drain) and it doesn't have wifi (another battery drain) but it has everything else you could probably want for the best of both worlds between point and shoot and travel zoom. Sure you can probably find more zoom or more megapixels, but if you play around with this camera I guarantee you'll appreciate how easy it is to use, how compact and lightweight it is, and how fast and clear it takes pictures.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beyond Impressed!", "Author": "Tarra Grammenos", "ReviewID": "RQNEARKP4FB8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're reading this review, chances are you're researching and shopping around for a camera. I did the same thing for over a year (no even kidding). I had my heart set on a Canon because every person at Best Buy pointed me in that direction. Here were my wants:Long zoomLight weight and smallCool colorEasy to use - I wanted a point-and-shoot... I wanted to do exactly what it said in the title... point... and shoot. Not point, adjust, move, zoom, adjust, tweak, change color, move a few steps, and finally shoot. No thanks.I seriously had my heart set on a Canon until I walked into National Camera Exchange in Edina and the sales guy showed me the Canons, said they were great cameras but wait... have you checked out this Sony? Again, I was stubborn but decided to check it out. The guy literally spent a half hour with me trying to sway me away from the Canon and towards the Sony. I'm SO glad he did. Sony has a 10 times zoom - the Canon only had a 5 or 8, its much lighter and smaller, so much easier to use, really quick - I can point... oh and look at that - I can shoot! And it turns out awesome! Have you used panoramic before? It sold me! I just got back from Hawaii (the reason I bought the camera) and it took AMAZING pictures of ocean, beaches, rocks, ohhhh amazing. The picture looked better than it did in real life!I know the other reviews on here have given the camera a 5 star and I did too but coming from someone who: A. I'm cheap. Spending 250 bucks on anything is a lot to me. B: I used my iPod touch camera for a while... apparently my standards aren't that high. C. I'm stubborn and for a year thought I wanted a Canon. Turns out I didn't. D. I listened to the expert at the store - he wasn't a Sony rep, he wasn't on commission - he sold me the camera he thought fit me the best and gave me the best 'bang for my buck' as I told him I wanted.

I wanted a camera that I can tote comfortably in my pocket but didn't want to sacrifice photo quality or capability. Here's a synopsis of what I found and why these didn't not make the cutoff:Canon S100- only 5x optical zoom, high price, and low battery life (CIPA rated at only 200 photos)Canon Elph 510- only takes 10 minutes of HD videoCanon SX260 HS- typically has high review ratings however lacks HDR, only takes 15 minutes of HD video, and no in-camera stitching of panorama photosNikon S9300- nice feature set but reviewed lower than the competition (CNET, Amazon, PhotographyBlog, and TechRadar)Panasonic SZ7- compared to the WX150 this has shorter battery life and longer off-to-on-and-shoot time but otherwise was competitive in my search, however, in direct comparison at least one pro review (PCMag) site says WX150 is much sharperPanasonic ZS20- more than one pro review site indicated strong redeye and limited ability of in-camera adjustment to reduce this; additionally not as good in low light as others. Further when I played with this model in the store the autofocus seemed slow to reactSamsung WB850F- reviewed lower than the competition (Amazon, DigitalCameraInfo, PCMag, PhotographyBlog, and TechRadar)Sony HX20V- larger than I prefer, otherwise I would have bought this oneAfter a week of looking at paper stats the Sony WX150 won out so I picked one up at Target for the same price as currently here on Amazon (~ $250). Target only has the silver, although I'd call it gun-metal grey because it's a dark silver. I wanted black but in the back of my mind I thought I'd be returning this for the Sony HX20V. However after several days of practicing with the WX150 I'm going to keep it; plus the \"silver\" color is growing on me.As suggested in reviews, the pics are sharp and colors are punchy. No complaints there. My main concern were lack of manual controls, particularly shutter control when taking extreme low-light pics. This baby has a max shutter speed of 4s but control is entirely automatic. I selected the low-light setting in the SCENE controls, mounted on a tripod, and gave it a go. The WX150 did ok but nothing to write home about. If you have specific need for extreme low-light photography you'll want the next class up in P&S; cameras with a 30s max shutter speed.With that said, in conventional low-light settings the WX150 is fantastic! If you want pics that look like what your eyes see then use the auto mode. If you want pics that capture more light than what your eyes can see then use the handheld twilight setting. On this setting I can take pictures in a dark room and the photos look as if the light was turned on. Its pretty amazing.Low-light video is exceptional as well; the videos you take will be WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). The video does not fall down in low light however it cannot \"add\" lighting by adjusting shutter speed as in the case of capturing stills.Pictures taken at the full 10x optical zoom are just as good as with no zoom. The ClearImage zoom goes to 20x and only a really critical eye will see any differences. Beyond that, the digital zoom takes you out to 40x which indeed shows image degradation as expected. Overall, exceptional. Truly exceptional considering it's less than 1 inch thick.Focus, metering, white balance, ISO, and exposure are individually selectable. A live histogram is displayed. Tracking focus is a usefull feature if you wish to make sure a specific spot is continually in focus.Panorama capturing is easy as pie. The camera lets you capture in any direction: up, down, left, or right.Off-to-on is as quick as advertised. Press the on button and you're ready to capture in an instant.I bought a class10 32GB SDHC card and downloading 100MB videos happens in just seconds.When I was reading the marketing promo's for this camera I kept seeing it has what Sony calls an Exmor R sensor, which is simply their branding for backlit CMOS sensors. Judging from the low-light capabilities I'd say this technology is more than lip-service. If you are in the market, keep this in mind. Last year's models may be cheaper but those would likely have the older frontlit CCD sensors.Overall I'm very happy. I won't be trading this for the bulkier Sony HX20V but I don't need anymore capabilities than the WX150 has. They say the best camera is the one you have with you. This thing slips into your pocket with really no more bulk than your phone.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "State of the art travel zoom", "Author": "Abbey Normal \"J39\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q0P7Q19LWP9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for the following qualities in a travel zoom:1) At least a 10:1 zoom2) Good low light performance3) Lightweight and compact4) Optical Image stabilizationIt performs well in low light.

I am not as experienced at the craft as some others especially those who are professionals in the trade but starting with my Nikon FE back in the early 80's I knew I was hooked. This Sony Cyber shot is not to be confused with a DSLR which has aperture and/or shutter speed settings as well as interchangeable lenses. But what this camera excels at is that it thinks. It's amazing. For example if you want to emphasize your subject in the shot, normally you would adjust your aperture to blur out the background. With this camera and a quick click on the menu button you can choose to emphasize your subject, and blur out the background automatically. This camera actually instantaneously takes two pictures and blends them both together into one shot; one with beautiful clarity of the subject and another of the background that it blurs just right to a pleasing degree, and then blends them into one shot. Like I said, \"This camera thinks\".The totally amazing thing about this camera, something my nephew took to testing out right away was the clear image zoom and stability. I don't know how they do it but Sony has accomplished two things that are from outer space. One, you can zoom this camera using 10x optical zoom, considered the ideal method, and also use the digital zoom for another 10x for a total of 20x. Most camera aficionado's roll their eyes back when you talk about digital zoom because that usually means a camera derived cropped shot with lots of graininess; not with this puppy. They have somehow managed to create a \"clear image\" method that gives you absolute clarity even when zoomed out to 20x. Not only is it clear but it is also stable.I have been using Flip Ultra and Creative cameras and unless you have them on a tripod, even taking a standard shot will record every little minute shake of your hand. The Sony Cyber shot not only steadies the jitters, it also is effective while zoomed out at 20X; that is nuts. So this camera can actually give you results that you would feel proud to publish even without a tripod.I love the full size 3\" LCD on the back, something that only full size DSLR's are accustomed to. Yes in direct sunlight it is a bit hard to read, and is something to learn how to deal with, but otherwise it is large and clear. I have it set to display in HD which eats up more battery life but I love to see the high quality right when taking a shoot, or when reviewing it. They have a lower setting which conserves more battery life.Talking about batteries, be sure and get some extras. This camera provides 29 minutes on a full charge. You can buy them from Sony, or get an aftermarket offering. This camera also does not come with a memory card. The internal memory is only designed to give you practically no shots, so get a memory card. This is key because I spent a lot of time researching this and the answer was nowhere to be found, and that is will this camera accept the UHS-1 newly designated cards? It says that it takes the SDXC cards, but not whether it would accept the UHS-1. After reading the reviews I was warned that if the camera you are buying it for doesn't accept them, they simply won't work. So the answer is here, and the answer is yes, you can use them. I bought the SanDisk Extreme 32GB 45MB/s SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDX-032G-X46,Black and it works like a dream; not formatting or anything, just install and shoot. Other reviewers of that card talk about how much the 45MB/s speeds up their cameras over the old style 30MB/s cards.Now let's talk about the video quality. In a word; amazing. This is a shocker when you plug this directly into a high def TV running 1920x1080. If you shoot in the native format for high def it may take up a good amount of space on your card but with 32 Gigs you have way more than enough. With a simple change in the menu you can shoot in MP4 which saves space and is the preferred method for the internet.I love how small it is. It really is a pocket camera. You can fit this in your T-shirt pocket, although buying one of the many cases designed for it here at Amazon is a good idea. That provides a safe haven for the camera as well as extra storage for extra batteries and memory cards. It is traditionally a good idea to get more than one memory card in the event you are away and a card starts to act up; this way you have a backup.When you zoom all the way out to 20x this camera takes on an awesome look. The lens is really out there for a camera of this size. No matter how skilled you are at taking movies, having a decent editing software can make all of the difference between a more professional clip and one that is strictly for amateurs. Windows 7 has an available download for free of Windows Movie Maker, and it even comes included on some PC's like my friends Dell. I have Pinnacle Pinnacle Studio HD Ultimate Collection Version 15 which has more Hollywood type studio effects than most of the others. It seems to be a nice go between the free versions, and getting the full blown professional programs in the thousand dollars plus club.Overall this camera is a quantum leap in technology, level of resolution, features, and precision over the Flip cameras and other competitors that I have grown accustomed to using. The kicker is that this camera sells for only a few extra dollars over what those went, and are going for.I bought an Olympus digital camera setup in the past ten years, and it garnered top honors in printed picture results from the leading consumer reporting magazine. I'm hoping to get back into a full blown DSLR for even more exploring into the realm of both movie making, and still photography. DSLR's have experienced a technological breakthrough in the past few years making them capable of taking high def movies. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black) has the capability of generating a 60 fps output which is what you need if you hope to have slow motion in your bag of tricks when editing; that is really a nice feature.By the way this Sony also has the ability of when you are taking a movie that you can still click the shutter button to get stills albeit at a slightly lesser megapixel level than the camera is capable of. For the full 18.2 which is the highest megapixels that a CMOS lens is capable of according to the Sony rep, you will have to them as a standalone shot. I see Nikon has 24 megapixel advertised but they allude to software enhancement to create that kind of equivalent. One last thing worth mentioning is that this camera takes up to 10 frames per second in burst mode which are shutter derived for maximum clarity. The Nikon D3100 only takes 4, the D3200 only takes 5, and the Panasonic G2 at four or five times the price, which is highly touted only takes 5 as well. (It does have a 40 picture burst mode but I think that is done electronically)One other feature I really love is the Panorama setting. You can take a sweeping shot of a landscape, or a room and the camera instantly gathers it all up and makes one large panoramic shot. I hate it when you take a picture of a room indoors and without a fish eye lens, not only does it not capture the whole room, it only captures a piece of the opposite wall making the room look tiny. I don't know if you have priced fish eye lenses, something the real estate pros use because they know how important it is to make the house, room, panorama look as large as it is, but they are a fortune. This Cyber shot has the Panorama feature built right in, and wow does it work. Once again I don't know how the camera knows how to glue together the pieces when you are taking a wild swooping shot across the room around three walls for example but it does. Once again, this camera knows what it sees and thinks. Let's call this the smart camera.So when you add it all up, this is quite a camera to beat. Ideally as a professional you carry this Sony around to capture events on the fly, and also have a full DSLR with all of the lenses for your general work. That is a lot to carry around so having this Sony is a quick shirt pocket, on off button click away from capturing great footage in HD. I love it, and you will too.

I have read almost 500 reviews before buying this and I am completely satisfied after using this camera. I should tell you what dragged me to this product. I made up my mind to buy a camera from one of the top three camera Makers....Canon/Sony/Nikon. Lot of recent models from canon are suffering from lens error after some initial use (even after taking extreme care). Shutter lens will get stuck in the middle and says lens error. You have to shed money to get it repaired or buy a new one. There are dedicated web sites which shout \"Lens error Canon\" (you can try Googling this). When everyone was getting ready to take July 4th New York Fire Works event a person next to me surprisingly shouted \"Lens Error?????\".....You know what he has canon in his hands and poor fellow he ended up not taking a single shot of that event.Well Nikon/Sony has not got such an error I guess (at least as per Google or earlier reviews). But P&S; of Nikon defies the base definition of a P&S; camera. You have to focus the object by half pressing the shutter button and then when lens adjusts you have to press the remaining half to get a meaningful photo. The whole process takes 3/4 secs and the object is GONE. Nikon is not Point and Shoot. It is Point Wait and Shoot. Even the picture clarity is far lesser than canon and sony.When I was roaming in best buy to see some cameras the sales guy took me to Sony WX150. The moment I saw the LCD screen's crispness I took it into my hands. Shot few sample pics from this camera/Canon Elph camera (could not remember the exact model)/Nikon L810. The picture is ultra sharp in Sony. The Auto focus is extremely fast. Less than a sec. Turn on time is blazing fast. Full HD video is amazing. Sound is superb. 10x Zoom is sufficient. Sweep Panorama is good (It is fun). Low light performance is amazing. Shot lot of photos in low light and no flash. Pics came very well. There are so many settings in the camera that you will definitely fall in Love. It has a size equal to the size of my wallet and slips smoothly into the pocket.Build quality is OK. Great wide angle lens. ABOVE ALL when you are shooting Full HD video you can take still pics also at the same time. WOWThe reason why I gave four stars is there are few cons also. I feel manual settings work better than auto. In auto mode photos came with a slight bluish tinge (which can be adjusted while auto correcting the images in computer). So if you are looking to use it in a manual mode, for changing light conditions you have to change the settings manually every time. It uses some in-camera processing after every shot. So in some settings the processing time is too high (3 secs). Zoom could have been better and price wise a little higher.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool but Lacking Camera", "Author": "Everest", "ReviewID": "R2YC8TT3YD1J0F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This small, thin camera quickly takes good pictures and is very easy to use - you hardly need the built-in manual! Unfortunately, there is no way to set the quality of the photo or the amount of JPEG compression (like you can on the Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera), so if you want to shoot extremely high-quality images for any reason, this camera won't work for you. Also, there is no manual focus and no way to set the exposure time.One of the neat features this camera has is \"Clear Image Zoom\". It zooms in on a small portion of the CCD chip and converts the lower resolution photo into a higher resolution one that has a higher quality than a cropped photo would have. I like to use this feature when shooting distant non-moving objects. There's also \"Digital Zoom\", which is basically the equivalent of cropping the image, except with lower JPEG compression. Even without either of the zooms I mentioned, the zoom abilities are still amazing; the lens is basically like a telescope, protracting about an inch and a half from the camera when zoomed in at max. With all three of these features combined, the camera can pick out details better than the average person claiming to have perfect eyesight.Of the shooting modes, \"Intelligent Auto\" and \"Superior Auto\" automatically choose a camera setting for the particular scene, and the second even reduces the noise a little. After that come a bunch of special effects. I prefer Intelligent Auto when I'm photographing in dim light or things without a whole lot of detail, and Superior Auto when it comes to finely textured things that I don't want to be smoothed out at all.There are some other nice settings, too: \"Backlight Correction HDR\" digitally reduces under- and over-exposed parts, so you can take photos containing both bright and dim spots; but if anything moves, there are ghosts in the image. There are some nice settings for low-light situations, too - some that use flash, others that don't. The ones that don't use flash usually take advantage of the camera's 12,800 ISO.When viewing already-taken photos, the switch from one picture to the next is so fast you can use the camera to preview stop-motion animation videos. If you try to zoom in on a photo, however, it's much slower, taking about 2 seconds before anything happens. The trimming feature is mostly a waste - when you try to center the subject in the screen, the camera takes such big steps that the subject is first on the left and then on the right, but never between.You never need to take the battery out of the camera to charge it - it comes with a USB > Micro USB cord and an adapter for a wall outlet, so you can charge the camera from a computer OR from a standard power outlet. Once the camera's charging, you can't enter camera mode, just playback mode. And in playback mode, you can't see how full the battery is; the only way to check is by unplugging the camera and turning it on.The camera has a liquid crystal display screen, commonly shortened to \"LCD screen.\" Most LCDs are polarized, so if you're wearing polarized sunglasses and tilt your head to one side, the screen goes black. This camera is different - the red, green, and blue components are polarized slightly differently, so when you wear sunglasses you see funky colors, but the screen never goes black. This can be a little weird, but it could be very useful.In the end, I strongly recommend this camera for anybody who doesn't care about manual modes or a little noise, but wants nice pictures.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera!", "Author": "B.", "ReviewID": "R1QM151NJON1MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing for its size and price. 10X optical zoom in a thin body!

As a photogrpaher, I always have a little point and shoot in my pocket in case you come across something you like to photograph. With 10x zoom this has become my travel camera for casual long weekend trips. The defocus feature is amazing. I use it for portraits and even macros. The intel auto is really intelligent. To capture sky details, you can focus on sky first then re-compose and you will be suprise with the outcome. Other features are plus. The night shots are so, so but still good for its kind.

It was 16.2 megapixels and purple and had a bunch of bells and whistles (it seemed) and I was pretty happy with it. I'd been a bit confused before that about how \"fancy\" I needed to get with a camera and whether it was worth it to pay more for this or that inscrutible feature. My boyfriend was buying me the camera and I didn't want him to pay more for features I wouldn't appreciate or use or megapixels that make no visible difference.Then, a few months later, I ended up with this Sony Cyber-shot. I'd been pretty happy with my new Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH25 until then and I was really ready to be not-impressed with the Cyber-shot.As soon as the Cyber-shot arrived, I took both cameras on a biking trip in wine country with my boyfriend. He was using the Lumix, and I was using this camera. I have to say, this camera blew the Lumix away. If I didn't understand before why I would pay a little more for something like the Cyber-shot, now I do. The stability feature worked very well, the zoom took great pictures, and when we zoomed in on the same things (a lizard, a crow in between grapevine rows) my pictures came out much clearer. I also got more detail out of pictures shot in blazingly bright sunlight. Holding my arm out and taking video while wobbling along on my bike looked good and came out pretty smooth. Low light conditions also looked great.I played around with the different settings on the camera. There are some artistic modes like \"illustration\" which are very cool. After taking a few pictures this way, I realized you can take a normal picture, then go back and apply the illustration effect (or one of the other effects) and then save it as a new picture, which makes more sense. Ultimately I found I'd rather save one copy as illustration, one copy as watercolor, bring them both into Photoshop and overlay illustration over watercolor at 47% opacity, but I guess I'm never happy with just using things the way they are. You can adjust the settings, though, so your illustration is a little less heavy on the ink outlines or whatever. Your choices are just high, medium and low, or in the case of the \"extracted color\" filter, you choose between red, green, blue or yellow. The choices are in the setup menu, so you don't automatically get them when you choose a filter.I can't say I've used all the features on the camera, but I've been trying! There is 3D, but I have no way currently to display anything 3D, so that feature is a bit useless to me...for now. The sweep panoramic mode is pretty great, I've gotten great, sweeping shots of the San Francisco Bay using it, and I just figured out how to shoot it in a higher definition. I do wish you could sweep in either direction. I've been taking sweep panoramas where I'm trying to get my bike in the shot on the left side and it can take a few tries since you sweep the camera right to left.I really like that you can charge the camera using usb from your computer. That means you don't have to open the flimsy battery door and disturb anything. It won't charge at the same time as you are using it for anything, but the fact that it doesn't have to be plugged into a wall outlet using an expensive, proprietary charging unit is fantastic.This is definitely my fun new toy.The camera goes up to a 20x zoom (10x optical), but I've given up mostly on using the zoom. I take pictures mostly when riding my bike and I would probably be really bad at biathalon, since exercising and then trying to shoot something with a steady hand seems pretty impossible for me. When not using the zoom, the stabilization works very well for me. In some situations the camera takes more than one shot and I don't know exactly what's going on in there, but it's fast and works well. When using the zoom, though, I've found that the picture will usually look good if you reduce the size of the image, but if instead you want to use it at full size, maybe cropping a piece of it out, that piece will be quite pixelated. Sometimes it's hard because it's such a wide angle and I can't get closer to what I want to shoot, but overall I'm happier with the image quality without any zoom. It wouldn't even matter except I'm able to print 13x19 prints at home these days, and at that size everything better be perfectly clear and crisp and cropping is going to make the image too small for the format.Overall, I think this is just a fantastic camera. I'm still learning all the features and haven't tried things such as anti-blink or auto-smile, but I really do understand now the benefit of paying a little more to get a LOT more camera.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera I've Ever Owned", "Author": "L.

It is smaller than other cameras with less features and less zoom. The 10X optical zoom was great -- as expected. It's the extras that are incredible. I took it on a two week trip to Europe. It performed well in low light settings like churches. The panoramic feature was great and worked well for a vista from a citadel in Namur, the Grand Place in Brussels, and a courtyard in Vilnius. Some settings allow you to blur the background which was probably the feature I used the most. At the end of the day the battery was low or completely exhausted; I wish I had bought a spare.I'm a self-confessed camera junky and I love this one. My last camera was a Canon. It worked well but there are feature I like better on the Sony. For example, to review photos you've taken, you push a button and to return to shooting you simply press the shutter. On the Canon, you have to toggle from viewing to shooting. I've missed shots with the Canon because I didn't realize the selector was in the wrong position. The screen on the back of the Sony is big but like most cameras, in bright sunlight it's tough to see. The key was to trust the camera's automatic settings.

Given it's compact size and relatively low cost it produces great images.There were only a few things I was looking for in a compact camera: image clarity/sharpness, optical zoom, color fidelity, open shadow areas when background is bright, and low light shooting, and this one does it all very well. I didn't really care about all the other bells and whistles - GPS, video, etc.There are a couple of things Sony can improve on. The analog user interface on the back could be better. Placement of various controls can take a little getting used too. The other is when shooting indoors in iA mode it wants to fire off the flash even when there is plenty of ambient light, ruining the picture. It works great if you turn off Auto flash and turn on only in really low light conditions.

(Great for most situations).* Background defocus; adjust how much defocus you want the background to have which gives you a lower or greater depth of field.* Picture effect; tons to choose from such as partial colour, watercolour, illustration, black & white, pop colour and more!Partial colour is my favourite as it lets you single out a particular colour (red, blue, green & yellow), so if you have a red rose and have it on the red setting, the rose will be red, however everything else will be in black and white.* Scene mode; 15 pre-set modes to give you the most out of certain scenes. Here are some scenes available; soft skin, landscape, night portrait, hand-held twilight, gourmet, beach and more.* 3D still picture; viewable on 3DTV's.- PANORAMA:* iSweep panorama; shoot panoramic image by panning across the scene.I love this setting, it's extremely easy to do and the results are fantastic, also choose from standard, wide or high-resolution panoramic shots.* 3D sweep panorama; take a 3D panoramic image displayable on a 3DTV.* Sweep multi-angle; can be displayed on a 3DTV or this camera, though personally is a bit of a gimmick setting in my opinion.* Underwater sweep panorama; natural colours for a fantastic underwater shot. *Need the underwater housing for this mode!- MOVIE:You have the choice of three different video quality; FX (highest quality with 1920x1080(60i) resolution, FH (High quality 1920x1080(60i) & HQ (Standard quality with 1440x1080(60i) resolution.Two modes are available in movie mode; 'Intelligent Auto' or 'Scene Mode' which will effect your picture outcome when taking a picture whilst recording.The overall quality of the video and sound was decent, it's not as good as most camcorders available, however it's great for family videos and outings.- - -The battery life is pretty good, I've had it out for a whole day and didn't once need to recharge it until I got back home.I have been really pleased with the outcome of most shots, it does portrait, landscape, panoramic, daytime shots and night-shots(as long as the flash can cover the subject) brilliantly, as for low-light conditions without flash or night-time shots even when using hand-held twilight settings, have been extremely poor in my experience, I still have yet to take one good photo in such conditions.Apart from that I really like this camera and would still recommend it, but for those who want that little bit extra, I would recommend an upgrade.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA", "Author": "A Gamer at Heart", "ReviewID": "R3V3ODS02COJ3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer, nor a serious amateur photographer.  I am a dad who likes to take great pictures of his family and important events.  I say that so you can gauge the value of my review accordingly.I have owned several Sony digital point and shoot cameras over the last 10 years.  I recently switched from Sony to a Canon point and shoot.  I was mildly satisfied with the Canon's picture quality and was eager to try another camera.  I have had this camera a while but wanted to wait on my review until after I used it over our recent summer vacation.  In short, while no point and shoot camera is perfect, this Sony is a tremendous camera and a great value for the price.The beauty of this point and shoot is the ability to be as involved, or as uninvolved, in the  photo setting up process as you want. A point and shoot, by definition, means you turn the camera on, point at your subject, and press a button.  This camera performs that function very well - it turns on very quickly and is ready to shoot almost instantaneously.What I really like is the easy to navigate and understand menu.  Select EASY and most options are just removed.  You point and shoot.  Select INTELLIGENT AUTO and the camera does its best to determine what type of scene you are photographing, selecting from 10 different scene types. (night, portrait, backlit, etc.)  Select SUPERIOR AUTO and the camera adds three additional scene types.  Select SCENE and you can choose from a myriad of additional scene specific settings, like for the beach, shooting at night with or without a tripod, defocusing the background (so it looks like a DSLR), etc.  Overall, I found the camera did an excellent job correctly detecting the settings and delivering very high quality, color correct, images.One of my pet peeves is auto flash destroying the background of a picture shot at night.  The subject is lit but the background is too darkened to see any detail. This Sony thankfully does not have that problem.  It properly lights the subject while correcting the exposure to show background. One of the scene selections is called HANDHELD TWILIGHT and allows you to shoot in low light without a flash.  My pictures taken in this setting were excellent.The menu settings are intuitive, and easy to understand. You can even access a built in help menu, which I thought was a very nice touch.  The camera is incredibly small - which I like because I prefer a small, compact camera.  Both INTELLIGENT AUTO and SUPERIOR AUTO contain an image stabilization ability, and out of the hundreds of vacation photos I took (many on horseback, moving and bouncing) only a handful were out of focus. I point this out because some believe a camera can be too small and difficult to hold, producing shaky images.  I suffered no such problems.  The buttons are small as well, but manageable.This camera shoots video in high definition (1080P).  The highest quality video setting can only be burned to Blu-Ray.  I shot my vacation videos in this mode and suffered some minor stuttering during playback on my gaming computer which has a high end gaming video card for rendering video.  I would recommend the next lowest setting unless you plan to burn your movies to Blu-Ray.  The minor stuttering aside, the quality was amazing.  My relatives (who I forced to watch my vacation videos) were stunned by the video quality that this tiny camera delivered.  The zoom is also very impressive.  I took clear, quality images with the zoom nearly maxed out with little noise.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this camera. SUPERIOR AUTO takes the guess work out of settings and delivers wonderful pictures. The BEACH mode delivered stunning ocean photos. Give this camera a try and I suspect you will also be pleased.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera", "Author": "Sierratango", "ReviewID": "R31MC6HQVO9ETR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went for the WX-150 after trying a Panasonic ZS-20 (which I also reviewed) and have to say that I am much happier with the WX-150.  It is definitely slightly pricy for the features offered, but I think you're paying for the premium lens and processor/sensor package.  The photo quality definitely justifies the price.  It's the same Exmor-R sensor offered in the Sony HX200V which goes for over $400.  The photos are the best I've seen in a point and shoot in this price neighborhood and I spent hours upon hours researching cameras, reviews and comparison photos (thanks digitalcamerainfo).  Considering I paid $200 for my Kodak C875 five years ago I would say this camera is very fairly priced.Okay, so I'll cut to the chase.  All of the features mentioned on the Amazon item description for this camera are great and exceeded my expectations.  So, I'll skip re-describing them here (as much as possible) and mention the things I would have liked to know before buying this camera.  I'll start out saying it is tiny.  Like almost spy-camera tiny.  At first that seemed very strange to me, but it's like anything else, once you get used to it it seems normal.  The WX-150 was weird to hold at first and I was afraid it would easily slip out of my fingers.  That's what the provided wrist-strap is for, I suppose.  Now picking up my old camera makes me feel like I'm picking up a clunky plastic brick.The next thing to mention is that the camera seems a little slow.  Taking burst pictures takes about 3-5 seconds to record after doing the burst and that is a lifetime if you jumped the gun on trying to capture that perfect action shot you were trying to catch.  However, it is amazing when you do capture a cottontail rabbit in mid-hop or a bird taking off into the air with wings outstretched.  The burst photos aren't perfect but about half of your ten-shot series will be beautiful.  The burst mode shuts off the flash so you better have good lighting (preferably outside) if you want to capture action.  I have to agree with the reviewer who said they wished Sony would have offered a 2-per second burst mode for up to 50 shots like Panasonic.  That would almost guarantee capturing any action shot you were trying to catch.  I guess that's what video is for, though.Taking regular photos is also a bit slow - especially if you have the flash on.  The camera waits until the capacitor is recharged for the flash before it will let you take another photo with flash on.  My conspiratorial side thinks that Sony detuned this camera's speed so it would take less business from their more expensive models.  The speed definitely isn't a deal-breaker - this camera is like greased lightning compared to my old camera, but it does seem a bit slower than the ZS-20 I tried for a week.Now the zoom, while the zoom is only 10x I found cropping (or using the digital zoom at 20x) provided better quality photos than the Panasonic at 20x optical zoom.  Sony has a beautiful thing going when it comes to picture quality.  For a non-DSLR this camera takes great photos and that's the most important feature for a camera to have.The user interface takes a little learning, but you should have it down pat after the first 200-300 photos.  There is an onboard user manual which is very nice and answers most of your questions.  It even describes what all the little icons mean for the current configuration you have the camera set to - so it's pretty easy to know what is going on.  The buttons on the back are tiny and I have bumped the spin-dial a couple of times while taking photos which can screw up your shot because the spin dial changes the camera mode and the camera will take the photo in the accidentally selected mode.  The on/off button takes only a touch to turn the camera on so that may cause the camera to accidentally turn on in your pocket.  Hopefully Sony was smart enough to put some sort of limiter on the lens so if it does turn on in your pocket it won't try to force the lens to come out and cause damage.  I'd test it to find out, but I'd rather not break it two weeks after getting it.The camera has onboard red-eye correction software that will do a good job of removing red-eye after the photo is taken if you go through the steps.  I've needed to do that a few times.  It also offers \"smile-detection\" software which works okay.  I've noticed that the kids need to really be smiling big and for more than a second or two to make it work.  Kids who don't smile very big or very long won't work very well with this feature.The camera does not allow aperture or shutter control so don't buy it thinking you'll be able to get that cool nighttime freeway shot where the car lights are streaking down the road - or capture a bolt of lightning during an electrical storm, unless you're extremely lucky.  The camera does provide what 99% of camera buyers want - a camera you can turn on, take a great picture, and move on with enjoying what you're doing.The pictures turn out very nicely in \"intelligent auto\".  It does a great job of taking any thought out of taking a great picture and makes pointing and shooting easy-breezy.  I've noticed, however you need to have the flash on with motion/action photos even with moderate light or you end up with blurry pictures.  That goes for all modes, not just \"intelligent auto\".  Also, the intelligent auto changes scene modes automatically - though not always completely accurately.  Oddly, when running in \"intelligent auto\" mode I did have \"infant\" come up while taking a photo of my one-year old so the camera can do it, but it isn't an option if you try to select it manually by switching to scene mode.  A lot of times the intelligent auto mode sets to \"flower\" mode when taking pictures of the kids.The scene modes seem a little limited in options.  There is no infant or kid mode (though they do offer \"pet\" and \"food\").  The camera has artistic modes that do things like cut out all but red, green, blue, or yellow and makes everything else back and white.  That makes for some cool pictures especially if you're at a flower garden.  It also has a cartoon feature that makes whatever you take a picture of look like a cartoon drawing.  It's kind of neat and fun to play with.A couple of last minor things.  The cord attaches to the bottom of the camera so you can't have it sitting upright while charging or hooked to your computer.  I suppose it doesn't matter because it's so skinny that it would be susceptible to tipping over anyway.  Also, it would have been nice if they had provided a rubber grip on the front to aid in one-handed holding of the camera.  It's so light that it isn't a big issue, but a rubber grip would have been appreciated.  It wouldn't have had to be much - just a small protrusion of rubber sticking out no farther than the lens.So, to summarize, the camera is very nice for people who want to take great pictures without a lot of hassle all while being able to put the camera in your pocket without it being very noticeable to you or anyone else.  The photos are great for a non-DSLR and the features are plentiful enough to keep you from wishing too much that you'd spent another $100 for only a few more features.  Definitely a camera for point-and-shooters who want a few more features like panorama, HD video, and burst shooting and a lot better photo quality.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great technology in small package", "Author": "J. Franzel", "ReviewID": "RYKQD5H4WIK15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Point and shoots seem to be getting replaced by smart phone cameras, but I think they are still useful and relevant if they pack a lot of zoom, and handle low light conditions well.  The WX150 seems to do both of these well, and it produces really nice images.  While I have both an SLR and smartphone camera, I needed a camera for taking images/movies at my kids events where I don't want to lug an SLR, kids are up on stage or in a gym outside reach of flash, the lighting is not great (inside).  Its also nice to have a tiny camera for birthdays, hikes, and other events where you want to take a lot of pics with flash and don't want to drain you phone battery.A few thoughts on things people are talking about in other reviews:Image Quality - search the web and Flickr and judge for yourself.  Some of the shots I've seen and taken are pretty amazing.  Be aware this camera is doing a lot of processing before it delivers the final image, and this may include taking several shots in quick succession and combining them for a final image.  Taking a few shots quickly allows better exposure when there are both dark shadows and highlights in the same scene (HDR).  The algorithms used are decent, I'm impressed.  Obviously an SLR will give you a better original non processed image if you have it with you, you have the right exposure set, you manually do HDR in post processing, etc. (who has time and energy for this with kids?).  The CMOS sensor does seem to provide better low light images, and this combined with the software algorithms and stabilization provide a decent final image.  A note about blurry images: 1) some modes on this camera assume a tripod as they use slow shutter speed, so don't use them or allow camera to pick them, and expect clear shots if the subject is moving 2) when you are zoomed in 10x and trying to capture a moving image outside of flash range with no blur, its almost impossible to get a clear image, but that will be with any camera unless you have a $10,000 lens.Usability - Generally the usability is good.  The buttons are placed well, and are fairly standard as point and shoots go (for Sony and Canon).  However, this is a small camera, thus its buttons are small.  If you have large man hands, it will be harder I think.  I have medium man hands and its a bit difficult, but manageable.Mac Compatibility - Don't worry if you have a newer Mac.  Movies import to iMovie 11 just fine, and no problem getting images into iPhoto or Lightroom 4.  Since this camera support SD card format, you can also pull the card and insert it into your Mac's SD reader to extract the images (but not movies).Manual Controls - no pure manual control for things like aperture and shutter, and no RAW mode, but I don't want this anyway.  There are many scene selections you can manually set, so if you recognize the lighting conditions of the scene, and the auto mode doesn't figure it out, you can manually override with the scene selection.  This includes shots such as beach, snow, night portrait,  landscape, high sensitivity, etc.  You can set your ISO, metering (center, spot), turn off flash, etc. so overall I think there is pretty good manual control if you need it.Manuals - The printed manual doesn't really describe the camera settings.  You need to go online and find the HTML version, or use on-camera manual.  On camera manual is a great idea in case you forget something, but I found the online HTML help the best (to learn all the settings of the camera).Build Quality - Jury is out on how well the camera will hold up.  Its seems like the plastic is softer than older generation cameras.  I already have a few scratches and gouges on it, and I have barely used it (not sure how they got there).  The battery cover seems a bit flimsy as well, and could easily break.  I'd be careful with is camera, and don't let the kids play with it.  Also, get a square trade warranty if concerned.Charger/cables - Note that the charge supplied is just a USB charger, so you must charge the camera by keeping the battery in the camera and plugging it in to charger with supplied mini USB cable (like a smart phone).  I actually like this in some cases, but I can see this being a limiting factor if you have a couple of batteries (there is a solution for this, after market charger).  It seems you can use any USB charger to charge this camera, and you can charge by plugging in the USB cable into your computer.  If you lose the charger or cable, they are standard, so easily replaceable (great if you lose them on vacation).So, after a few weeks of use, I'm giving this 5 stars for now as initial impressions are good.  Certainly this is the best point and shoot I have ever owned for creating the best pictures possible in such a tiny form factor.Update:If you need a good case for this camera, and okay with another brand, look here (I posted a review): Canon 5601B001 Deluxe Soft Camera Case PSC-2070, Black", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great back up", "Author": "Stacie L.

This camera really surprised me.  It is very quick to focus and takes quite good pictures.  I can easily see this camera being the grab and go one I use at boring events I just want to have a camera at.  Believe me, this may not sound like much of a compliment, but I will not use a point and shoot unless it maintains a minimum quality so it really is a good camera.Dislikes is the power cord needing to have whole camera plugged in to wall.  I will get over it, but I think I also may invest in the aftermarket second battery and regular style charger. Images are just not as good as DSLR, but really I cannot possibly expect them to be, so I need to be fair. Also not wild about the small lag between being able to take a second image.  It's small for sure, but being used to DSLRs zero wait time has spoiled me.Major Likes are super small size (which may be a dislike for someone with big hands), and speed of image capture.  Battery seems quite good as well.I sincerely think this camera will not be shoved in a drawer somewhere.  As much as I like my DSLR,I don't always like lugging it around.

I was leary about going Sony after I bought a Lumix and was disappointed. But this is by far the best camera I have owned. I have a 32 Extreme Card which makes this lightning fast with 180+ minutes of highest quality HD video to capture. Here is what I liked:- Clarity, it takes quick sharp photos because the lens is amazingly intelligent- Low Light/Non Flash indoor pictures. I take more pictures indoors with no flash and the colors are richer and more accurate- Video! Video! Video! While not a dedicated video cam, it is mine. Has a dedicated video button and allows you to capture HD camera pics without stopping your video. Now you dont have to decide HOW you want to capture.. DO BOTH!- Video Clairty, True HD video with decent sound quality. Zoom is nice and slow and not as distracting as others Ive owned- Panorama, not that new but you can take a WIDE shot in great quality. Awesome for scenic views or even indoors- Size and ease of menusNegatives...- Even for a more natural flash, I still get typical washed out indoor photos- Charger connects to camera not a battery dock.

The F30 set the standard for low noise, low-light photo quality in small-sensor cameras and its performance has been difficult to beat --and I've tried, and purchased, several cameras since the Fuji. The new Sony Exmor R sensor appears to be the low-light performer I've been looking for and so I purchased and tested both the Sony WX50 and the Sony WX150 for comparison.The specs for the Sony WX50 and WX150 are virtually identical except for the optical zoom range (5X Carl Zeiss lens vs 10X Sony G lens) and sensor size (16MP vs 18MP). I fully expected the WX50 with its 5X lens and 16MP sensor to have a slight edge in image quality due to simpler optics and fewer megapixels in the Exmor R sensor. What I discovered was exactly the opposite.I took several photos of the same low-light scene using each camera set to ISO 200, 400, 800, and 1600 in the widest angle setting (no zoom). When reviewed at 1:1, the WX50 photos showed considerable noise at ISO 400 and above (800 and 1600 were nearly unacceptable) whereas the WX150 was extremely noise-free even at 800 (with 1600 being quite impressive). The WX150's images were even slightly better than my trusty Fuji F30 --finally! There was no comparison --the WX150 lens/sensor combination provides noticeably clearer, lower-noise images at high ISO and it provides better shadow detail and clarity despite its 10X zoom range (usually a compromise) and higher MP (higher MP sensors are usually noisier).  Very impressive.In addition to its excellent low-light performance and low ISO noise, the WX150 is the fastest focusing camera I've tested.  Focusing in good lighting is nearly instant.  Focusing in low-light is faster than most cameras can muster in good lighting.  This means you're never waiting for focus lock --it just happens immediately and you don't miss a good shot.The WX150 also excels when zooming during video recording.  The lens is rock-stable and quiet during optical zooming unlike the WX50 whose lens \"wobbled\" during zooming and this shows up as side-to-side image \"jitter\" in the recorded video.  The WX150 clearly has a more robust lens mechanism than the smaller 5X zoom in the WX50. Just to be sure I didn't have a sample defect, I purchased and tested a second WX50 camera and it had exactly the same lens wobble. So the WX150 wins hands down.Overall, the Sony WX150 outperforms similar cameras I've tried from Canon and Panasonic. The Sony Exmor R sensor is indeed an excellent low-light performer as advertised and finally gives me a reason to retire my trusty Fuji F30. The WX150's focus speed is the best I've seen on a point-and-shoot regardless of price.  If you desire the lowest image noise at high ISO settings along with a stable lens during video zooming, then the Sony WX150 is the way to go. It is the highest quality point-and-shoot camera if your maximum budget is about $200.  I never considered Sony a serious contender in a point-and-shoot market dominated by Canon and Panasonic but their WX150 with the Exmor R sensor stands head and shoulders above the rest.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!", "Author": "Rivers \"Rivers\"", "ReviewID": "R3061XT1RKMSAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome!!!

The camera came with the battery, battery charger, mini USB cable.NOTE: I bought the camera with a 32 GB SD card. Because the package did not include an SD card. The 32 GBs allow you to take up 5000+ pictures. So if you're going on a vacation. This should be perfect because you won't have to plug it on your laptop everytime to transfer the pictures. The 32 GBs is enough. I recommend you buy a case as well. Maybe a screen protector, none of those came with the package.WHAT I LIKE:+ The panorama feature. Excellent! You have to put it on a steady surface and do it somewhat quickly for the picture to come out right cause when I did it really slowly, I couldn't get it right but if you have a tripod, you don't have to worry about that .+ The partial color effect. My friend has a DSLR and she has to load the pictures on the PC in order to do the partial color effect. But with the WX150, you can just set it and shoot. I put up two images on Amazon that you can see, partial color red (The car) and partial color green (the plant). HOWEVER, it does sometime leave out parts of that particular color, but it is understandable, every color has different shades .+ Quick shots. You can take quick clear shots in less than 1 second, as opposed to waiting 2 seconds until the target if your pictures has moved and the moment is gone. But of course its not the same as take your time with the camera so it can get a crispy clear shot. But its great nonetheless+ Its really easy to use. Theres scene selection which I enjoy but if youre not the type to pick what sort of setting you want for your picture, you can just put it on easy mode and it'll do that for you. However, setting it yourself might be better sometimes.+ 3D feature. Although I'll probably never use it . It's still nice to mention this to people, that makes them understand how advanced this camera is.WHAT I DISLIKE:- Some pictures lack detail, I expected it to be more detailed than that and I expected them to last when you zoom in on your picture, but theyre clear nonetheless- No Bluetooth or WiFi. This may be a good thing or bad. Depends on you, it'd take a lot of your battery life that's for sure. But when youre travelling it's nice to just upload it to whatever you want, but if you have the SD slot on your laptop, that makes it eaiser as well, you don't have to plug the laptop to the camera everytime just take the SD card out and put it on the laptop- NO HDMI CABLE, NO CASE, NO SD CARD with the package. ALSO, BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY!!! One won't last you a full day esp if you're travellingI love the camera, I recommend it to anyone who wants a compact camera close to an DSLR that's light and small.WHAT I DISLIKE:", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3RPZYOGTSYLK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received this camera today from Amazon. This camera is replacing a Sony DSC-WX9 which is really last years version of the WX-150. Sadly, the WX9 did not survive a mountain biking accident last weekend and I need to replace it before vacation next week. Enter the WX150. Took about 100 pictures around the house tonight. This camera has a few more bells and whistles than the WX9 so I wanted to try them out. Some of the new scene modes are really fun to play with although you could probably do most of those things with a good photo editing program. I really like the background defocus feature, great for portraits. I'm no photo pro just need an easy point and shoot and this camera fits the bill. Turns on really quick, quicker I think than my WX9 and is ready to shoot. Way better in low light conditions than the old unit. Most shots around the house were with out flash taken at dusk and they turned out excellent! The 10x zoom is an extra bonus and works really well. Video is top notch full HD 1080i and looks great when burned to blu ray. I bought this because the old WX9 was an excellent camera and always took great pics. Never had any problems with it and I already had extra batterys ect. One thing that always bugged me with Sony cameras was you had to use their proprietary charging cords. Not so with the WX150. Sony finally got their act together and this new camera uses a standard micro usb charger. Sucks, because now my old charging cable from the WX9 wont work with the WX150, but we have a dozen or so micro usb chargers laying around so you dont have to worry about losing or forgetting your charging cable. Kudos to Sony! All in all a great camera and I would highly recommend it! Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera specs but below average images.", "Author": "80sGuy", "ReviewID": "R2P6SXJR91PX2T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overview/Image Performance:The WX150 is perfect for hauling around and conceals well under any purse or shirt pocket because it is lightweight and not much bigger than a cigarette box, but unfortunately the camera produces sub-par image quality at best. Yes, it is an 18-megapixel camera, but more pixel count doesn't necessarily mean you will get better picture results. I have two other cameras, an early Leica D-LUX (3.2MP) and a Panasonic Lumix FX9 (also Leica lens, 6MP) and both took far more superior images; the pictures are much sharper, richer, clearer and virtually distortion-free while maintaining color-balance compared to the Sony. Colors from images taken with the WX150 were way off, especially with 'red' when shot under low-lit conditions or during night scenes. The color appears washed-out and rendered more of an 'orange' tone.Day shots were okay in certain conditions but suffers major tone-balance and shadow-separation; meaning if I took a picture on a bright sunny day, the sky would look nice and blue but shady areas under trees are darken to a point where it is impossible to point out the subject. Images viewed under 1:1 (full size) also looked like pastel or watercolor paintings and the subjects often looked smeared and soften beyond recognition thus making it very artificial.Ergonomics:While the camera is very compact but it also felt cheap and flimsy, especially with the dial and buttons. The scroll wheel has too much 'play' to it and I often find myself scrolls pass my intended selection. The little setting buttons offers little tactile feel and requires more push to engage. The play button for image preview worked fine without needing to power the camera 'on' but pressing the play button again would not turn the screen off. The only way to do this is to press the power button located on top of the camera, confusing yes. Last but not least, the Shutter button; it is way too sensitive when trying to engage 'autofocus'. Most cameras have a two-step push feel (half way stop until focus, then push down all the way to a final step to shoot) but the WX150 only have one, that is if you can avoid slightly pushing it beyond, otherwise the camera would start shooting.With a that said, the WX150 isn't a bad camera for the average user, or for someone that is used to taking pictures from a smartphone. The camera does offer a good amount of auto settings but none seem to be able to adjust to the effects of colors and shadows correctly. Needless to say the camera went back. One feature that will be missed would be the 'Blur' effect -- tricky to use, which I find very useful.Pros:*Light and compact*10X Zoom*Blur effect.Cons:*Mediocre image quality*Poor color-rendering (washed out)*Poor color-balance and shadow-separation on images*Lack of 'two-step' press feel on Shutter button for autofocus.*Lack of traditional Battery Charger, can only be charged with USB/adapter to wall.

image/video...I have both Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 and Canon Power-Shot SX260 HS...- The photos quality produced by Canon is better if you use the \"Manual Option\".  However, if you compare both cameras in \"Auto Mode\", Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150  is the Winner.- The video quality produced by Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 is much better than  Canon Power-Shot SX260 HS (particularly during night time/low light).  Canon SX 260 struggles to focus when you use the video in low light, whereas  Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 keeps crisp images/ video in low light.  For shooting movies in FULL HD QUALITY:  * Canon SX 260 HS:1920 x 1080 (24 fps)in MP4 format only.  * Sony DSC WX150:  1440 x 1080 (30 fps)in MP4 format,  1920 x 1080 (60i)in AVCHD format, and  1440 x 1080 (60i) in AVCHD formatSo, it is depend on you, if you prefer shooting images only and like to use \"Manual,Tv,and AV Mode\", you may prefer to buy Canon Power-Shot SX260 HS;on the other hand, if  \"Auto Mode and Video Mode\" are importantfor you, you may prefer to buy Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150.Canon SX 260 HS has feature: GPS & Optical Zoom (20x),but Sony WX150 has abilities to shoot images while recording video & zooming, and 3D Sweep Panorama function...Both of them are best seller at Amazon...", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing little BEAST!", "Author": "ThatOneDude", "ReviewID": "R2NG5DVWFHUIRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good camera no doubt.

Something I can keep in my coat or bag to have at all times.  Bought several others and returned them.  This is the keeper.  The image quality is DECIDEDLY superior to anything else I've tried in the sub-$200 price range.  Also superior to a few more expensive models I've looked at in store.In full daylight, the pictures are sharp as tacks.  In a poorly lit room, the quality does go down a touch, but nothing like any of the other cameras I've tried recently.  With this camera, I usually manage to avoid using the flash when shooting indoors.  Even a reasonably bright room gets excellent sharpness.On the practical side, it's ridiculously small and portable.  Fits in the breast pocket of my windbreaker, would even fit in a pretty small purse I'd imagine too.  Battery life has been excellent as well.  I was shooting pictures of my daughter most of the day today, as well as a few videos (which are GREAT quality, by the way), and barely dented the battery life.This camera is definitely not for someone who wants easy options for manual focus and exposure control.  It's not a dSLR, but that's OK.  A dSLR is not the best choice for every situation.  Sure, they take great photos, but they're bulky and heavy.  They're also HUGE theft targets.  If you want to take pictures of daily life, or when hiking maybe, you don't want big.  What's the point of superior image quality if you always leave it at home or in the car?  I've been pretty into manual photography, but lately, I don't really find myself wanting to take the time to do that. The camera makes most shooting decisions for you, and it does them pretty darned well.  80% of the time the Intelligent mode is fine.  When I have to switch to a scene mode, usually those modes do a great job delivering what they claim to offer.  That's more than many can say.  The handheld twilight mode delivers the best no-flash handheld night shots I've ever seen.  Anti-motion blur really stops most motion blur.Oh, and the digital zoom?  Always been of the impression they are useless.  Not this one.  Combining the 10X optical and 10X digital has produced some excellent shots, and surprisingly sharp at that.  Sure, you could zoom in afterwards in Photoshop, but if you zoom in right then, the camera makes shutter, focus, and aperture decisions for the scene you actually mean to capture.  That may not be true if you go wide and zoom in using Photoshop.  Seriously, try the digital zoom!Overall, best digital camera I've ever owned!", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lightning fast very slim point and shoot camera capable of capturing high quality images", "Author": "dlc \"dlc\"", "ReviewID": "R3SJTSL46RZUSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a point and shoot camera the WX150 is simply phenomenal, it is very slim and small making it super portable to easily take along anywhere. It uses a \"BSI\" CMOS sensor improving low-light performance and this camera is ultra fast! It starts up very, very quickly and the shutter lag is virtually non-existent, allowing one to quickly capture those precious spontaneous moments. Even with all this performance in an extremely compact camera the image quality is excellent.I recently purchased a Canon SX160 I also reviewed on Amazon that the WX150 cannot match in terms of maximum zoom, 64x vs 20x, and with all the manual controls the Canon has. Although the SX160 is an inferior \"point and shoot\" camera compared with the WX150, the Canon is much bigger and much slower with very long flash recharge times. I was able to find the WX150 for $149.99 at a B&M; store with the big red and white bulls eye logo.Video is impressive at full HD 1080p with stereo sound which also allows you to capture still photos as you are recording, very nifty! This camera also has a burst mode capable of capturing 10 frames per second and I tried it, and it works. I believe my Canon Rebel XS DSLR is only capable of approx. 3 frames per second.The only potential downside to this camera may be durability as it does feel very plasticky and light, so I do tend to handle this Sony with more care than my other cameras. In comparison the Canon SX160 feels very robust and a metal Sony DSC T99 I have has been very durable.Although the Sony lacks manual controls it has an impressive array of usable custom settings and artistic scene modes. With superior portability and a 10x zoom the Cybershot WX150 is very close to being a perfect point and shoot camera, and did I mention this thing is incredibly fast?UPDATE: I just realized the \"Superior Auto\" setting on the WX150 uses advanced HDR (High Dynamic Range)technology which very quickly captures multiple images at varying exposure levels of the same subject with a single click of the shutter release button. The camera gathers from the under exposed to the over exposed ends of the images captured then processes them together for a single photo of greater dynamic range, pretty cool for a point and shoot camera!", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great all-around camera for novices", "Author": "John E.

The criteria for the gift was easy to use, nice looking, and under $250 (she didn't want the stress of carrying a $500 camera around).  I initially bought a Fujifilm F660EXR but the pictures were constantly coming out washed out, so I decided to look for alternatives and spotted this model at CostCo.  It seemed to be everything I was looking for, and after reading reviews here, I pulled the trigger. After 3 months of use, I can say I'm overall very happy I returned the Fuji and went with the Sony.Loves:- Simply wonderful pictures.  Images are sharp and true to color.  It generally does a great job with skin tones and bright colors- Low light pictures come out well with no need for adjustments or use of strobe flash.  This is the part that truly amazes me every time- Panaromic feature works nicely and is a breeze to use- HD Movies are easily shot with the push of one button and come out sharp with stereo sound- Camera automatically turns off to preserve battery- Charges via USB cable, so no need to lug battery charger around- Uses standard SDHC memory cards.  No more Sony Proprietary \"MemStick\" adapters needed.- Clock allows for setting of \"Home\" and \"Destination\" time zones, letting you easily change to a different time zone when travellingSo-Sos:- Battery life is just OK.  Generally speaking it's good for a few hours of picture taking.  Shooting video drops the battery life significantly.- Size of the body is a bit small.  It's fine for women with small hands, but folks with large hands may find it easy to drop.  I'd recommend investing in a wrist strap, which inexplicably is not included- Direct video output is only via HDMI, with no cable or adapter includedGripes:- By default, movies are taken in AVCHD format (\"MPO\" file extension).  This format is not supported by Windows Media Player, YouTube, etc. so you'll need to download the \"PlayMemories\" program from Sony to get them converted.  I preferred to use MP4 format for videos, which is easily configured in the camera settings.- No waterproof housing available. It's a shame, because I would love to take this on a dive.

I rarely took it out of auto mode, and 95% of the photos I took came out great.  That's close enough for me.  I didn't even think about the camera, because it worked every time and was frustration free.I 'upgraded' to a Canon sd4500 in 2010.  Hated it. While it was a more advanced camera, it was slow, which meant that I could only use 20% of the photos I took of my toddler as the rest were a blur, because the auto settings 'thought' about things too much and I missed photo ops from a wiggly toddler.  I avoided taking pictures because I hated that thing so much.This Sony is as close as I've found to the old SD750.  Similar layout, size and it's quick and easy and hassle free. Just what I was looking for.This isn't the camera for you if you want to mess with a lot of features.  It's designed to be idiot proof and a true 'point and shoot'.The quality is also on par with the old Canon.  It seems to be well made and sturdy enough that it might survive a fall (though I certainly don't want to test that).I'm not used to how Sony set up their menus, but it was intuitive enough for me to figure out everything I wanted to do without the manual (mostly to turn off the obnoxious navigation beeping.)The auto focus settings work great and the vast majority of the photos I've taken have turned out wonderfully.

I went with the Sony because of it's supposed speed and better low light abilities and 1080 video.The low light photos are better, but with way too much noise reduction. They look like paintings in many shots. The video is much better. The 10X zoom is convenient. But the camera is not all that fast. There's no sport scene option. The super intelligent auto mode takes forever to process every photo taken. The P mode suffers from poor and inconsistent exposures. The AF tracking has a mind of its own. It rarely hits and tracks what you want it to unless you're zoomed in or really close so nothing else is in the frame. It needs to start in the middle of the frame to make it easier to track what you want. Continuous shooting is limited to 10 frames. Processing is slow.The zoom control scales WAY too fast. Nearly impossible to get the zoom you want, plus it flies through to the \"intelligent\" zoom way to easy. The OIS is not that effective especially in video.The screen I would rate as below average. Very difficult to see in the day and not very sharp for 460K. It also smudges something awful and is difficult to clean. The build is really lightweight flimsy feeling plastic. Which is good and bad. Good that it's really light, bad in that it doesn't feel like it will last long. My Panasonic is mostly metal and not that much heavier.

Shepard \"Rural Art Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RGQ4KXOSDMNMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really wish this could have been an Amazon purchase, but after watching the prices for 2 months, and realizing I would still be buying from a third party that may or may not be a Sony authorized dealer, I just went ahead and chose an authorized dealer listed on the Sony site that also had great Google reviews.  Saved me 30-50 dollars that way.  If you're spending more than $139 total, you may consider this route too (sadly).  I chose this camera after extensive research on reviews, both professional and by users, and tried the cameras out in stores first.Anyway.. on to the camera.  I just got it in the mail today and have been playing with it on and off. I have an 8gb, class 10 card in it. While it's not the most amazing camera ever made, I get a number of great usable shots, even with a wiggly child, just using the intelligent photo mode. I don't have to try and get her to hold still for 3-5 seconds anymore, and got many photos while I had her moving around, just to see what would happen. It's no 100%, but it's pretty blasted good, and for the size and price point? Incredibly good. My Kodak ran around $200-250 when I bought it, and even on sports mode, doesn't do as well as this Sony in this respect.  The march of technology I guess. So, I guess while not being  the most incredible camera ever, it's one of the most incredible I've actually had in my hands and knew how to use, regardless of price point.The color grabber mode (where everything is black and white, except the color you choose - red, blue, green, yellow) is fun and seems quite accurate :).  This camera is sometimes scary smart, and it's neat to see what mode it sets itself to as you're moving around in different environments. It feels like it's lightyears ahead of my kodak in this respect.  Like the difference between cell phones and smart phones.  And fast?  Omg.. it's MAYBE a full second after turning on that I can take a photo.  No lie.  And I can take back to back photos quickly!  The only mode that seems to take forever is the high iso (to be expected, high isos are usually painfully slow) and the intelligent+.  I was NOT impressed by the intelligent+, as it seemed to add skin softening effects to the photos I took.  And it takes longer to process, so you're down to 2-5 seconds between shots. Macro mode, letting the camera select it while in Intelligent auto, was pretty impressive for a little camera. Things like pen caps, the small text at the bottom of a bottle of crafting stuff... clear as day and big on screen.  I can't wait to try taking photos of flowers with this :)Video so far has been very impressive too.  I took a test video in dim indoor lighting, and it came our great.  Not grainy, the sound was awesome.  Very cool.  And this was on the mp4 setting (which is more universal for websites and programs). The photo-from-video I took was just like a screen shot from the movie.  Same colors, lighting, clarity.Now, the bad.  I, too, found the door to the battery/card compartment to be seriously weak.  C'mon, Sony! When closed, it still leaves a hair of a gap (just enough to gather dirt). The internal latch that actually keeps the door closed is so incredibly tiny.  Out of everything to go wrong on this camera, I'd say it would be that before anything else.  It does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty, so let's see how far I get with it.  If nothing else, it looks like you could secure it with tape if you had to, and it wouldn't interfere with anything else.Oh, and don't pull on the wrist strap.  Due to the incredibly tiny size of this camera, it seems the plastic on this is a bit on the lighter side, too.  But, you really shouldn't be tugging hard on it anyway, so I don't see this as a serious flaw.  Just be aware.  This camera is tiny and built for small size and small weight. Why wouldn't you consider something like that as anything but delicate?  It's smaller and lighter than my droid phone by a good measure.  Crazy. I have small hands and a great sense of feel, so this camera is incredibly easy for me to use.  I have no problem getting the zoom to work perfect, the selection wheel to go where I want it to (it doesn't look like it from the photos, but aside from it being a 4 way directional button, there really is a wheel there too!)  Contrary to some reviews I have read, it does have a \"half-press\" shutter action, as in, pressing it halfway down gets your focus, and all the way down takes your picture.  It's just incredibly sensitive, and takes a very light touch. I actually love this, but I could see a lot of people having issues without knowing ahead of time.  The menu takes just a little while to figure out.  For me, going from a kodak to a sony, it was still a breeze to figure it all out.  I had a minor hick up in getting it to recognize the card I formatted for the Sony, though. I had to go into the settings for the photo files, and it figured it out from there.Overall, I would say this is an awesome camera for what I was looking for:  something very very fast, something small, and something that takes good photos with little effort.  This totally fit the bill. I have a feeling I may be using this much more than the more expensive Kodak I bought just a year or two ago.  It's just so much easier to carry, and is so much faster, which is what I need with a small child! The Kodak can do some really neat things, but like another reviewer says, you miss every shot you don't take, and when your camera is 1 lb+ and big, you don't take as many as you could.If the plastic was a little thicker maybe, or at very least, the battery door latched better, I would consider giving this 5 stars.  It really is a smart, fast, fun little camera.  I hope to continue updating this post as time goes on, as I do most of my reviews on electronics and household items.  I also hope to add a video to this review of things I have mentioned here, as well as uploading photos.Update March 12, 2013:  I haven't gotten a ton of playtime with it yet.  But I have yet to recharge the battery.  I expected it to dissipate quickly in the camera due to some other reviews, but it's still showing a totally full charge. Very cool :)  Pet mode doesn't seem to have a flash, so becareful using it in low light areas.  It takes good photos, but my dog highly distrusts it, flash or no, and wont hold still.  Ah well.  So far, still perfect for my needs: fast, good pics, and few errors. I should get more use by Easter, and hopefully get that video up soon!Update March 20, 2013:  I went to finish this review up with some video of the door issue, but it seems a bit of a moot point now.  The manufacturer (sony) has discontinued this camera, so getting a hold of a new one for a reasonable price looks to be almost impossible right now.  It looks like the successor of this camera comes in the form of the WX80 and the more expensive WX300, both of which have wifi and very similar features to this one (even the same buttons and case and look of this model).  I only hope they fixed the battery door issue, because that was the only real complaint I had on this model.  So far, I am still in love with this camera, and I am STILL on the same original charge on the battery. I can't wait to get more usage out of it, and if it gives me a good run, I will definitely consider the WX300 or whatever else they come up with in the future.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good upgrade", "Author": "Nancy Rector", "ReviewID": "R30UPSO52YM5KY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I dropped and broke the predecessor to this camera, a Sony DSC-W530.

I can't explain my bad luck. I research, I study, I test, and yet . . . awful photos.  Finally, a camera that takes great photos!Here's how I see myself: catlike movements silently across the gym floor as I shoot with precise timing to grab that \"Awwwww\" shot for my sons in the school play or effortlessly shooting the action on the little league field and even the soft focused family shot where everyone looks happy, serene and surrounded by love (and we're all gorgeous, of course).Here's how it really is: bump the lady next to me, accidentally photo bomb the guy behind me and after 100s of shots in just a few minutes, I end up with heads: the guy's head in front of me and the backs of the heads of nearly every first grader on stage. Or the family photo is everyone gathering or separating, or auntie is fuzzy,  the toddlers kinda blend together and there must be an unearthly visitor cuz the upper left corner has a glaring sun spot.This camera can't solve my composition problems, by it's gone a loooooong way toward compensating for every other one of my photographic deficiencies. My photos actually LOOK GOOD.  Better than good. Especially important is that there isn't any lag between shots (or at least I don't notice). I've been frustrated in the past that I have to wait a few seconds before the camera or flash is ready to take another shot. (My family isn't even that patient.)  I didn't know to consider that feature until I suffered repeatedly because of the delay. This little camera is fabulous. The only negative is that it really is diminutive. I have to concentrate on keeping track of it.  If Sony could add a \"find my camera\" feature, I'd pay a premium.With this purchase, I gave up my grandiose plans of photography excellence, and accepted that I just will not use all the advanced features and adjustments of other cameras. It's too cumbersome and I end up avoiding using a  camera at all. And turns out I don't have to because this little baby takes care of those details so I can focus on the bigger picture.

I ended up choosing the WX150 primarily because of the 10x zoom and the larger LCD screen; these features fit my needs better and the special pricing was just right too!Even though I've only had the camera for a short period, about 3 weeks, I've used it quite a bit and am very happy with my decision. Over Thanksgiving weekend I took several hundred pictures and about a dozen videos, 98% of the pictures and all of the videos were perfect. I kept the camera in Intelligent mode for the pictures and it performed exceptionally well through the entire weekend from mornings through night. Low light scenes came out amazing as did varied light scenes at the bowling alley, which are challenging for all compact cameras.

This camera is the new flagship for Sony's lineup of lower end Point-and-Shoot line, and is an awesome upgrade.  The zoom is amazing, the picture quality is good and always focused, but mainly the video quality and options are great, all of which is why I upgraded this camera.  I will admit the colors have a bit more 'POP' or vividness, but in a good way.  This camera records video up to 1920x1080 60i at 30 frames a second in AVCHD.I highly recommend using the middle quality 1280x720 MP4 option just because of its ease to edit on a PC and WAY lower file size than AVCHD.  I tested video after video between 1920x1080 AVCHD (24Mbps), 1440x1080 MP4 (12 Mbps), 1280X720 MP4 (6Mbps) on a HD computer monitor and 1080 HDTV, and could not tell the difference in color or quality.  The video is clear in low light with little noise and the same with pictures.  The battery life is decent for a point-and-shoot.  The audio quality is very good. It picks up noise at all volumes from whispers to booms and bangs just like the Flip Ultra HD II and Logitech C910, but this camera picks up the booms and bangs WITHOUT distortion (Picks up bass very well unlike the two listed above).Once, I shot a video for YouTube outside in the sun, using a tripod, and the camera, after about 20 minutes, stopped recording and turned off by itself about a minute after I noticed a high temp icon started flashing on the screen.  This is a downside if you are looking to do continuous recording in hot weather as it shuts itself off.  Needless to say, this might affect video recording if you leave this camera in a hot place like a car.  I paid a little over $220 for this camera, and it is a lot better (in just about every way) than my overpriced Flip Ultra HD II.  Although the WX150's (China) build quality isn't as good as my W350 (Japan), it seems like it is better than my W350 in every way.  Panoramic shots are still kinda disappointing on this camera (as with all Sony's), very grainy and low quality.  If you have time to play with this camera, it does come with all kinds of cool, but some useless, effects that you can change in pictures and some carry over to videos like partial color.  You can also take some cool photos in the panoramic mode, such as 3D panoramic photos.  It takes multiple pictures at once synced with the cameras gyroscope, and plays back on the camera as you move the camera.  Neat!This isn't a DSLR or close to it, so don't expect too much manual settings.  Point-and-Shoot.  Overall, if you are looking for a very decent point-and-shoot for very good photos and very nice HD videos for a decent price, this is THE camera to get.Pros:  Great stereo & good 1080i video  Great high-quality photos  10x optical zoom  Fast focusing and minimal shutter lag  3D Panoramic photosCons:  Stops recording in high internal temperatures  Flimsy HDMI cover  Panoramic quality", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera", "Author": "WLSD22", "ReviewID": "R2H8T0IOA7M9C8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 18.2 MP is perfect for me.

It was such a convenient (small) little camera to grab and go, and a mp upgrade from my Pentax Optio P70 that I loved and also takes great shots.The things I did not like about it were the dials and controls and \"hook\" closures for the battery and memory card.  It was so fast I almost couldn't stop the Auto Focus at the right spot, but that was good for catching something quickly, altho I missed a lot of shots cuz I wasn't ready and had to find the controls.  The tiny grab dial to zoom in or out was hard to find and I kept hitting something next to or above it, some dial, can't remember now.  I tried to catch an eagle on the Elk Refuge in a tree before he flew away and got a great shot, but it was VERY hard to hold steady when in a hurry and getting the panic button shot where you needed good control over what you were doing to hold/focus/zoom/press without moving so much.  The camera is so fast but my fingers were freezing in this incident and I was on a sleigh with about 15 other people also trying to see the eagle.  I got lucky with my eagle shot.  I blew it up to 13 x 19 I think...big...and it is really nice.  An 8x10 would prob be amazing considering all the panic that went into the shot.I could not get my videos to show up in iphoto as videos.  I had a 10 video card.  I don't know where they are.I was going to buy another one, the silver one is a great deal right now, but researched several other sites and found the Sony Cyber Shot HX10V which design wise is just what I want.  I got it at a great price, for only about $50 more than the blue WX150 ($188) cost me, and so I thought I'd try it. It has a few more choices for being creative.  WX150, I didn't play around with too much cuz auto was so fast and pictures, how could I do better!  I just hadn't gotten to that part of experimentation with it yet.  Rates on the HX10V on Sony.com site are great.  I am only hoping that the pictures will be as good or better.This little Blue Sony WX150 is wonderful but clumsy controls are small.  The on/off button is flush with the top and very small making it hard to find/turn on quickly, but it turns on fast once you find the button.  The battery/card open/close door is crummy.  You have to use your finger nail on a very tiny door, also flush with the bottom, instead of the old slide open with your thumb method which I like/love.I was trying to catch something (a rapidly dying sunset shot) while driving slowly down a road one evening and I dropped the camera from my almost rolled down window and I watched it fall about 10-15 feet from the car door on the hard icey road.  The battery fell out and the door was open.  I got out of the car depressed at what I had done, picked it up almost crying, but the camera suffered nothing at all.  (yea, thank you God)I was impressed with this, but I'd check out the HX10V.

Compared to the pricier Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX66 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.3-inch OLED (White) (2012 Model), this one provides more zoom; however the pricier DSC-TX66 provides a touch-screen control (OLED display) and is much thinner and lighter.  The picture and video settings are almost identical for both cameras.  Just like other cameras in this family, the battery compartment doesn't inspire much confidence with its flimsy looks.Having used to the touch-screen controls of TX66, the scroll-based menu in the WX150 seems less impressive - however, the controls on both are very intuitive - given the wide range of options, it will take some time to get used to all the command settings.  The video quality of both cameras are exceptional - and either will replace a handycam easily.  If you are more interested in a lighter camera with a touch screen and willing to compromise on the zoom (5X opposed to 10X in the WX150) and pay up for it (about 100$ more), DSC-TX66 may be a better choice. But if the touchscreen is not a critical requirement for you and zoom is of more importance, WX150 is a very compelling choice at this price-point.

It fits in my shirt pocket, one of the small pockets on my cargo shorts, or even the watch pocket of my jeans.zoom: the 10x zoom came out great. It starts fairly wide angle, so I usually zoom in a bit for family shots.smart+: it has a 'leave everything to the camera' setting that worked great for me -- i think it does some post-processing.easy mode: makes the print on the screen bigger!select-a-scene: there are lots of special case situations  you can select: at the beach, sunsets, two anti-shake selections... more than I will probably ever bother to investigate.CON:instructions - It took me two days to figure out how to get the thing not to flash! I was putting my finger over the flash so as not to get reflections back. annoying and not in the meager instructions. This is the only 'basic' function that was not obvious. In retrospect, it should have been obvious, so this is probably not much of a 'con'.movie button - there is a tiny button on the back that is hard to press, but that you have to press to take movies. There is a slider switch that says 'still' or 'movie', which one would think would tell the camera to take stills or movies when you press the regular button on top. But as far as I can tell it does nothing and you have to push the tiny button to start shooting the movies, which meant that all my movies  started and ended with pictures of my shoes, or terrible shake. I think they did this so you could take stills while in the middle of shooting a movie.Just in case someone does not know this, a warning:I have Mac computers, which do not handle the hi-def movies of the Sony cameras -- shame on Apple!If anyone knows any good fix for this, please let me know.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R2J1SN4QF2MQNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, which was important to me.

I have actually been using it mostly with the flash off, even indoors with the blinds closed and feel like I'm using my old SLR camera in terms of how fast the shutter response time is since it is so fast to focus.

I feel a bit silly for how excited I've been about this camera, but it is really thrilling to get such great results for such a reasonable price!

I received it today so I tested it out by taking about 20-30 pictures of my baby. I'd say out of those about half of them were blurry and if you zoom in on the ones that weren't blurry they had a sort of oil painting quality about them - it's weird. Anyway, I zoomed in on 1 of these new pictures and compared it side by side with a zoomed in picture from my old Kodak and in my opinion my Kodak picture was better! I showed it to my brother as well (I didn't tell him which picture was from which camera) and he also thought my old picture was better.

Let's just put it that way.  Wait for it to go on sale since it should drop at least a hundred bucks below the MSRP.  With that out of the way, on to my review.  I had a chance to preview this camera at my local Costco and compared it to other similar products.  I wound up going with this camera mainly because I liked how fast the shutter was taking pictures and the price point at which I bought it outdid the competition.  I purchased this for a trip to southeast Asia, where it is summer over there this time of year and VERY sunny.  I won't lie - this camera takes some getting used to with the different modes.  For instance, the all inclusive \"intelligent mode\" is different than the \"superior mode\" and learning the quirks of each takes a bit of time and practice to see what works best in your particular scenario given we do not have the option to choose ISO settings with these cheap digital cameras.My overall impressions: the video this camera takes is awesome.  I mean it's as good as or better than a camcorder.  The button wheel to select your picture mode is kind of annoying compared to a canon or nikon, where everything is painted on the top of the wheel and you can just move it to the desired location.  So yea, it takes an extra couple seconds to rotate the wheel on the Sony DSC to get to the correct picture mode you're looking for.Picture quality: Overall the colors come out very nice, again depending if you choose the proper picture mode to fit the situation.  Case in point, in low light during a sunrise with a little cloud cover.. the \"intelligent mode\" will make the background appear brighter than it really is vs. the superior mode which will more accurately reflect the color tone, however it may be too dark for your taste.  Some experimentation is required for those who want the best quality photos.  It will take good pictures regardless, but experimentation with the different modes can turn a good picture into a great picture.I'll try to post some of my photos with this camera for you to view and make your own decision.  One point of warning: this camera sometimes cannot accurately record dark reds very well.  A lot of times, I found certain red colors like a red rose would turn out more tomato colored red than deep red.  Those are really my only downsides to this camera: red tone can be off and you may need to experiment with the settings wheel to get the best pictures possible out of this camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've ever owned", "Author": "extreme0120", "ReviewID": "R3ENBL9UEOTS5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going into detail about this camera because there are other reviews here that have plenty to say about this unit.

It's been only a week, and I can't believe how well this little camera performs. I purchased this camera after my son broke my Nikon s6100 which I didn't care for all that much. Took great pictures outdoors and in well lit areas, but forget about low light situations. I've owned a d70s, and currently own a d7000. After using the s6300, and reading reviews on the new 6300/9300/6400 no way would I ever go back to a Nikon P&S.; After doing some heavy research and reading reviews I narrowed it down to 3 cameras: The Sony DSC-W150, the Panasonic sz7, and the canon sx260. Other Cameras Included the Nikon s6300, s9300, and a canon elph I can't remember the model #. I really wanted to go back to Nikon but After all my research and reading, this is what i ended up with. Keep in mind that I had an older Sony P&S; and HATED it, to this day it still works, and even my 7 year old son wont use it. I was reluctant to go with Sony as well, however for the price I got this camera at, and after reading all the reviews I pulled the trigger.  I purchased it the night before a trip to Disneyland. This is a good test for me as I get to shoot in day and night, and Disneyland Has all kinds of great architecture as well and bright vivid colors to shoot. Everything from little props to the shops, to the characters, Disneyland has it all. From the second you press the button, this little camera starts up very quick. No fancy logo at start up, just press the power button and start shooting. The first test was basic shooting, rides, buildings etc. What immediately amazed me was how quick the camera fired. There is very little shutter lag to begin with. Shutter lag was the first reason I stopped using my last Sony. I missed so many shots, and going to the Nikon was a breath of fresh air. This one puts the nikon to shame. As time goes on, technology continues to improve and this camera is no exception with it's impressive shutter lag (oxymoron). As with most point and shoot cameras it did, at times, take an extra second to focus at full zoom. This is my first 18mp P&S; camera and It does take some time to record a shot with that much info and a file that big. You definitely need to be patient when shooting when it comes to processing and recording images. The camera came with a class 4 card, and I did put one of my class 10 cards in and it did seem to slightly decrease the time to process and record and image. (I haven't had a chance to use the multi bust shot yet). Then there's the panorama sweep mode. Instead of taking multiple pictures and use a program to stitch the pictures, you press record and you have a few seconds to record a panorama. Again only a short period of use with this feature but so far pretty cool. There are scene modes aplenty here, everything from night portrait, low light no flash, pet mode, soft skin.. etc. There's tons of in camera editing options as well. Now you can't adjust shutter speed and aperture, but to be honest here, that's not quite what a P&S; camera is for. With all the scene options and in camera editing options being able to choose my shutter and f-stop aren't high on my priority list. If i wanted that much control I'd take my D7000 with me. What really impressed me was the intelligent scene mode recognition. No matter what the situation, the pictures came out perfect. I was pleasantly surprised with the sharpness and colors of the pictures. Each picture no matter what the scene, came out spectacular. The colors, the focus, not dull or not over saturated.Now for the bad. This camera is VERY VERY lightweight. This is bad and good. It's bad because it feels awkward in my hands, and in most people's opinion, the lightweight body will give the impression that it's not built well. Because it's so light, it was a little hard to keep steady at full zoom, however it does have image stabilization to compensate. The menus are not very intuitive at all. AS a matter of fact, I did some things that I thought would take me back, or to the next item I needed, and It was all messed up and had to start over. The buttons are again a little intuitive and the more playing the more confused I was. The one thing I do like is that switching from picture mode to movie mode to panorama is a slider which is nice because on my old Nikon a slight press of the movie button and you recorded a movie. As mentioned earlier, processing takes some time but again, get used to it, and you'll love this camera.I can't wait to play around with all the in camera editing and in camera effects this camera has to offer. But up to now, This camera is a perfect combination of great features and great picture quality, wrapped up in a lightweight body. While it doesn't give you the opportunity to control the shutter and Aperture, you won't need it, it takes great pictures all on it's own!", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures", "Author": "M.

It worked in extreme climatic conditions (-22F),but it was exposed to that environment for only about 10 minutes at a time.  I loved the way the camera automatically changed modes with the conditions (e.g., from standard view, to macro when dealing with extreme close-ups, to landscape, etc.).  I won't bother with the manual settings, as the camera does its thing with no additional help from me.The video also worked well, particularly the image-stabilization feature.  I was able to take great videos from a moving vehicle.On the down side (all of which are minor quibbles)----The zoom is slow to activate, and once it does start, the lens zooms in rapidly.  It works better when zooming out, but my videos are full of excessive zoom-in shots followed quickly by zooming out.--The 1.0X zoom level is very wide angle, and I often found that it was necessary to zoom to properly compose the shot.--I did not like Sony's license terms for their software, and I read these documents thoroughly before downloading software.  In particular, Sony demands that they have open and automatic access to one's computer to update and change their software without letting the user know. I didn't load their software because of this language.--The mode change wheel on the back is clumsy to use, but fortunately I have little need to move out of their automatic mode.  Others who want to change these settings may feel differently.--Once I had mounted the camera as a hard drive on my desktop computer, I could not get eject it.  The error message was that the Generic Volume couldn't be stopped.  So I had to shut down my computer before disconnecting the camera.  This problem may be attributable to my old machine (2002, Windows XP, but patched up to date). Your mileage may vary.--Once I transferred the videos to my hard drive, their .mts format would not play on my computer.  Again, the problem is likely to be my old hardware.  However, I downloaded a video conversation utility package, and it crashed as well.  I had hoped to convert these videos to .avi files.--The Sony batteries have 50% of the capacity of the generic Wasabi batteries (also purchased through Amazon).  One Sony battery was more expensive than two Wasabi batteries and their charger.  So I recommend the Wasabi hands-down compared to the Sony.I also recommend purchasing two memory cards.

Maybe a little large, but that never bothered me. What did bother me was that it took a fairly long amount of time to focus. When it had finished inwardly reflecting and gathered the courage to take a picture, it gave me a blurry mess. Not all of the time, but enough to make me look foolish with my incessant \"Wait. Let's try that again.\" There was this brief, half-second window before the picture was taken in which the stars would align and everything would be clear; however, my camera chose to be obscure. Perhaps taken by an artistic whim, I couldn't get much cooperation from it.This camera, however, is much more agreeable. It can be turned on and ready to go within 2 seconds and you can have a clear picture a second later. I'm satisfied with how it deals with low light.The flash works really well, but sans flash is appealing as well though there is noise, as expected. After the picture is taken, there is a brief wait (maybe a second or two) for the picture to show up on the screen, but I'd rather than a delay during the picture-taking process.I haven't messed with the video too much but, from my little experience, it looks great.A couple other things of note: (1) I don't usually care too much for special effect, but I thing the \"Illustration\" effect is pretty cool. It makes everything look as if it was drawn. (2) The two auto-focus settings may be all you need. They pick the right setting (e.g. Macro, night, etc...) and they do so seamlessly.

And I like that Sony places a small internal memory inside, so if the card is out, you can still shoot a few pictures. The zoom is acceptable -- of course even with image stabilizer you cannot get very sharp pictures with 10x zoom, then you can choose not to go that far and it works well.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of this camera.  I had a SC DSC-W730 prior to this and it was my favorite camera I had owned.  I go through digital camera's every couple years or so.  I'll admit, I'm hard on my cameras.  I'm around children a lot and I let them take pictures, inevitably the camera gets dropped...I throw my cameras in my purse at times and generally, I treat them as a functional daily item without tons of reverence.  My SC DSC-W730 lasted the longest of my digital cameras (almost 4 years) and until the last month of it's life every picture I took was beautiful.  Action shots, still shots, the photos were amazing.  I decided not to get the same camera because this version (SC DSC-WX150) had a higher zoom and that drew me in.  The zoom is pretty substantial, and for what I use it for it does it's job.  What I am NOT a fan of is this camera's ability to handle action shots.  I want to rip my hair out.  I have a 3yo child and before that (with my old camera) I babysat for a family of four children.  I know what to expect with (amateur!) action shots involving kids.  This camera does not give me beautiful, clear, first-time-photo shots.  I'm lucky when I get an action shot with this baby.  I'm still pining for my old Sony Cybershot.

I love the picture quality and the features are great. I've had it for a couple of years now and I still love it. I bought my mom a newer model of this camera for Christmas and she loves hers too. I have a DSLR as well but this little point and shoot is much easy to grab on the go just in case I want to take a few pictures. The picture quality is fantastic, the zoom is really impressive and the newer model has WiFi capabilities. It's very easy to use, I highly recommend this camera!Update: This camera has been treated like a baby, covered from weather, kept in case and used with care throughout it's entire life. After reading other reviews regarding a dust problem, I figured I could beat the odds, not so much. A little more than a year later, it now has a speck of dust on the sensor that cannot be cleaned by a professional camera shop. It shows up in EVERY picture in any level of zoom. Sony told me that for $91 plus taxes I can have it repaired because it's out of warranty. I'm not going to pay more than it's worth now to have it cleaned, so it's pretty much a useless camera that still has the ability to take beautiful pictures if cleaned. It's sad, I loved using this camera for everything, now it just sits on the shelf and I have gone back to my old faithful DSLR.Another update: After much contemplation regarding potentially damaging the camera, I used a vacuum on it and tada!

After doing a lot of shopping around, I found that there were two options and price ranges. You either get a highly complicated, bulky full size digital SLR, starting around $450 and going way way up in price, or you get a sub-standard light weight 16 mega-pixel or less camera for $170 or less.This camera is very unique. It sort of bridges the gap between the two. While you certainly cannot change the lense, it has many other features found in high-end full size digital SLRs while having a lightweight and ease of use closer to the lower digital cameras. It also has an 18.2 Mega pixel sensor, which is a few higher than your typical cameras of its price range and still costs less than $200 brand new.It lets you decide what kind of camera you want it to behave like. You can actually put it into 'easy' mode, in which the camera does all the thinking for you and works as fast and with higher image quality to your cell phone camera. But if you are doing some complicated shots, you have a HUGE variety of options.It has scene modes, where the camera adopts specific settings depending on what you are trying to shoot. It has a pet mode for example that makes great photos of your pets. It has a snowy outdoors mode, which makes shooting a ski-trip quite easy and effortless. You can even capture fireworks in its specific mode. There are about a dozen different scene modes.It also has a \"P\" mode which roughly equates to how an SLR would work. You can set the exposure and various other settings manually. You can even have it adopt various ISO's, simulating different types of film, which adjusts the sensitivity. This camera thereby performs incredibly well in low light.Finally, there are intelligent modes that adjust the various settings on the fly. I took a picture of an owl in a tree at night using one of these modes and the camera automatically took two pictures based on refocusing on the flash.The focusing mechanism is incredibly smart. It has properties typically seen in the big DSLRs like object tracking. You can have it target a particular object and if that object moves in the frame (or you move the camera), the focus square stays glued on the object. The focusing mechanism also has a mode whereby it recognizes the overall shape of a central object and attempts to focus on the average of that shape. For example, if you have a guitar in the picture, it will create a boxed shape around the guitar and make a good focus on the whole object.It even shoots photos in 3D, which is really really rare in cheaper digital cameras. You need a 3D tv to view the pictures and an HDMI cable to connect the two.The video capabilities are quite impressive. Not only does it shoot in 1080p, but it has a stereo microphone on the top of the camera. This makes all the difference in the world when shooting action. If someone is running across the field of view, you not only see them moving across the video in beautiful HD, but you hear their feet stomping from one side to the other, adding excellent realism to the recording.If you don't need 1080p you can shoot at lower levels. This is great for shooting relatively unimportant stuff for posting on websites as it makes the videos much smaller in file size while still looking great on smaller screens.The 10x zoom is a little slow to engage. But it works quite well and is an actual optical zoom. This means what you see is not going to be all pixelated when you zoom in on it. This works well when shooting distant objects.I purchased mine used from a pawn shop and the camera looks like it is brand new. The body is a light aluminum, and it feels remarkably solid while being quite light weight.So before you slap down half a grand on a big DSLR, ask yourself if you really are ready to deal with the complexity, expense, and weight of such cameras. And before you consider a lesser camera, check its mega pixels, 3D capability (really fun to use), stereo audio recording capability, and if it is just another plastic rectangle with minimal settings flexibility.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than my last overpriced crappy camera, but not the best", "Author": "K W", "ReviewID": "R1R4IOI43FQFS0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera works fine, however I am really disappointed that within a year of use (and careful storage when not in use), it has fibers or something inside the lens. So frustrating. My last camera (different brand) had the same issue quickly, and I had to buy this one. It doesn't seem to affect most pictures, unless it is something very solidly plain or white. The other issues I have are that I have to avoid using the flash like crazy because it makes a shadow behind the objects/people that I am photographing, no matter how close or far I am from them. Yuck. Also, it appears that the lens causes a shadow in the corner of some pictures, which is irritating.

I own two Nikon semi-pro DSLRs, which are heavy but give incredible control over a picture and elegant color rendering.  If you need to shoot wildlife in a forest, birds on the wing, or anything that requires clear control of the focus, this camera will disappoint completely for the simple reason that it has no viewfinder or manual focus control.

It eventually will download if I ignore the message.  The software also has no editing capability.  I end up still using my Olympus software for that.  2)  The settings are almost impossible to figure out.  Especially when you are in the middle of shooting and need to make an adjustment.  There is no way to over-ride the settings and put it on manual.  My Olympus had manual settings; this doesn't.  Just to turn the flash off requires going to the menu to try to find it every time.

There has been some absolutely thorough reviews posted and that is how I made a decision to buy this camera. The camera is small and I always use the wrist strap. One other note is that if this is your 1st. camera be advised that Sony has to be the worst company in the world for their Manuals. I had a Sony about 5 years (my 1st.) ago and almost sent it back, because I knew nothing and didn't know what the icons meant. I bought this point and shot because of reviews and I have used other camera's since. This camera is wonderful for those spontaneous shots and videos. One final thought is I have found that for me: I shot all my videos with the Movie Quality set to HQ standard image (1440x1080(60i) setting. The reason is that this setting views great, but more importantly, you will find it to be much more Forgiving to Sudden Movement than the higher settings and uses less storage.

It was the first 18MP point and shoot I had seen PLUS 10X zoom... and I haven't seen it at Sam's Club since, not sure what happened.  It replaced a 14MP Sony 5X lens point and shoot that my wife now carries.The Camera:  GREAT!!  I still have my 18MP Canon 60D 18MP DSLR, but I only use it for archival and document work on a tripod.  This Sony stays on my belt in a cell phone carrier and I use it all the time.  I don't know the amount of shots I've taken, but it's got to be over 10,000 since I bought it.  I have taken so many photos just because it's alway there.  I purchased 2 10X SDHC 16GB cards and two extra batteries and a combo 12V/wall charger, which I keep in my truck.  I use the after market batteries first because they have a more mAh ratings than the stock Sony battery.  I don't use a tripod with this camera and get good image results.  I've been able to identify birds at a distance with the image from this camera at 10X zoom that I could not identify with my 7X35 binoculars.  So, it's a good camera.  The video is fine.  The panoramic feature works okay, but I've gotten better results using individual images and stitching them together with PhotoShop.... or whatever program you wish. It takes more time that I expected to save an image and get ready for the next shot, but I've been spoiled by my Canon which will burn 90 or so shots in a row.

This camera is great under good lighting condition without doing too much scrutiny:Macro focusing is good even in zoom (Panasonic Lumix SZ7 has great trouble).Video quality is great and optical zoom adjust automatically according to image resolution and works smoothly with minimum lens movement noise pickups. Sound pickup is also pretty good.However under slightly challenging or low-light conditions, the image quality is poor and cannot withstand any close inspection.One explanation is the S/N of Exmor R CMOS Sensor. Another One is the small lens max aperture f=3.3 in order to implement the 10x optical zoom. 5x optical zoom in this price range of cameras usually have max aperture f=2.7 and thus have better low-light performance.To compensate its low-light inadequacy, Sony adds iAuto+ (Superior Auto) picture mode by automatically taking multiple shots and processed them together. Not a very useful feature in my opinion. Instead improve current Anti-Blur feature.Judging based on specification only, the new 2013 replacement model DSC-WX300 (20x optical zoom, max f=3.5, max ISO 12800) to be released in April 2013 will not fair any better in still image quality. However I do like DSC-WX300 more standard conventional buttons layout and all metal case construction.Features that can be easily added in firmware to make the camera more usable are adding at least one more still image size selection in 16:9 and 4:3.

Zoom not crystal clear at 10x optical.", "Author": "L. B. Keller", "ReviewID": "R8V2IAAJ4GPV7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (DSC-WX150) and the Sony DSC-HX10V.  I ran various home grown tests on both cameras under various conditions: action, with flash, without flash, zoom, natural light, etc.  Both cameras were set to the \"automatic smart green setting\".  Consistently the WX150 (this camera) had a blueish hint to the photos - as in a vivid purple iris looked blue not purple like real life.  We have oak bookcases.  Comparing photos side by side with both cameras, the bookcases with the WX150 didn't have the golden undertones.  The DSC-HX10V photos were much more true to color in all photo testing.  We called Sony about the blue issue and they said it must be a defective unit.  That may be the case.  I can only report on my experience.On the zoom test, I put both cameras to 10X optical and turned digital zoom off (note the HX10V has optical zoom to 16X).  I took pictures of the spines of my kids books from across the room.  The edges of the letters with the WX150 (this camera) were \"noisy\" whereas the HX10V at 10x optical were very clear (no, I did not pixel peep).  If you don't plan to do a lot of detailed zooming because you can be closer to your subject, this should be no big deal.  I take pictures of my kids swimming from the stands - I need a decent zoom without lugging a DSLR or hybrid.Both cameras performed about the same on action shots.  I had my kids jump on the bed for several minutes while my husband and I took photos with both cameras at the same time.  The HX10V does have a true sports mode which helped to reduce the blur some.  I still had to take a bunch to get the lucky action shots on both cameras.Note: all pictures were taken from the same distance, compared side by side, at the same size on the same monitor.  In other words this was as scientific as an average camera owner (not photographer) would do.  Ultimately we opted for the HX10V for the extra $60-$70.The only thing I liked better about the WX150 is the flash is built in whereas the HX10V's flash is a pop up and it is right where I want to hold the camera with the left hand (very annoying).  Though the HX10V flash is brighter and goes a farther distance.This is a great camera for many people.  I spend a lot of time making digital photo story books of our family every year so I wanted the best compact camera I could afford.  I wish this 150 didn't have the blue hue issue or we would have chosen it instead.I hope this helps the average camera buyer.

I only have one minor complaint but its so minor that I will still give it a 5. The battery is a bit smaller (250 shots) give or take. The battery if its in the camera will also drain battery, i notice that my battery was 25% just by having it in my camera for about 4 days and not shooting any pictures. But thats very minor and the battery will not change with a one day or night standby. I also bought another battery for it and its better than the one that comes with the camera so battery life is great right now!

If you want something that is instantaneous you probably need to spend more money.  This does exactly what I need when I need it to.  I also like the multi-shot feature.

The DSC-WX150 is cheaper than the old model and quite a lot less configurable. We've tried three or four cameras over the years and until now haven't been able to find an adequate replacement for it, not for 200 bucks anyway.This is a tiny camera, we have it set to 6:4 picture shape or postcard size as I always think this shape looks so much nicer when emailing or printing images. The default aspect is 4:3 the same shape as the cameras sensor so like an old fashioned TV screen. By setting aspect to 6:4 does mean a pair of small blank strips to the he top and bottom of the monitor screen. This also brings down the number of pixels in play from 18mp to a more manageable 13mp - so more space on the card and your PC for images. Who needs 18mp pics anyway?Okay about the camera, first the few niggles and quibbles I have with it. The camera does a lot of smart processing of images, there is no raw or less compression settings, so you're basically stuck with this whether you like it or not - Ideal for anyone who who's not into post-processing. The result of this process is revealed when you look at images at full size, white faces look pink and smoothed with artifacts evident. This appears to be caused by some over-zealous noise removal. The flip side of which is the camera performs well in quite dark situations without needing flash. As with most things your gain can have consequences elsewhere,in this case cropping and blowing up a portion of the image isn't very rewarding to say the least. I would also have liked the usual menu item giving, vivid/bright/natural saturation options. This is not much to ask in a camera at any price level.That's the not so good, hows about the good and very good and there's plenty of that! The 10x optical zoom is smooth and there appears to be little image degradation at either wide or telephoto. The zoom works in movie mode. Movie mode? why bother? This is an excellent movie camera. My wife has a dedicated Sony DCR-SX65 handycam and this baby knocks the socks of it and it's full HD as well.  Pictures are sharp straight out of the camera with reasonable resolution, until you pixel peep, but we're looking at a $200 camera here and not a $1000 dSLR.  We intend taking this camera which easily slips into a top pocket without bulging or weighing it down to Thailand and Cambodia next month, it looks exactly what we need.I agree with other feedbacks, grab yourself a replacement knockoff battery, they're as cheap as chips, we had one delivered to our home from China for $3.50. So for a few ommissions like the ability to choose some settings I can recommend this Sony for anyone looking for a cheap point and shoot which delivers sharp and decent resolution images in a very small case.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than anticipated", "Author": "Steven Takahashi", "ReviewID": "R34XRMIAODK01O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This unit takes great photos when there is low light.

So far I have used it exclusively in the Intelligent Auto mode, and photos are invariably appropriately focused and usually appropriately exposed.  I say \"usually\" because the camera seems to have a different exposure philosophy than my Canons.  The Canons seem to play \"by the book,\" underexposing to protect highlights.  Consequently I have to boost brightness of most of my photos in post processing.  The WX150 aims for correct exposure and pays the price of blown highlights in some situations.  I am happy with this tradeoff, and, if I weren't so lazy, I could easily make simple adjustments to prevent overexposure.  Video capability goes way beyond my Canons, as does the automatic panorama facility, though the latter is very poorly documented and hard to control, often requiring multiple attempts at the same shot.  One serious weakness of the camera is battery capacity.  I always carry an extra charged battery in a pocket of my camera case, and I have purchased an external charger.  Moreover, I have taken to removing the battery from the camera when the camera is not in use.  I have the impression that this gives me more shots.  For some potential buyers, poor battery capacity would be a deal breaker, but it is not that big an issue for me.

I have had it for a few days now, and have found nothing that I do not like about it.  All the features in the list by Sony, work as promised; the only one I have not tried and am not really interested in, is the 3D feature.  But everything else is top notch.  I have taken pictures at 18.1 MP and cropped them down to only 1/5 of original size and have still had sharp pictures.  Impressive.  That is a feature that comes in handy if you have kids or pets running around away from you and you want to catch them from a distance.The HD video is also impressive, and I have had fun taking pictures during video recording; the pictures are set at 13 MP and turn out nice and sharp.One of the features that makes this little powerhouse so easy to use, is the help feature built into the camera itself.  Scroll down the letters of the alphabet and you find help for anything you need in simple easy to follow instructions.I have two tripods that I have not tried out with my new camera, but will do so over the weekend.

This is the best camera I have ever owned !!  This camera is soooo  goood.  I am really happy with my Sony WX150.  I have had it for a month now and I can't stop smiling.  Pictures are really good (tons of settings to use and many of neat features.)  18.2 MP means there is lot of room for manipulation of your pictures.  I can't stop talking about the 1920x1080 crystal clear video (in stereo also).  When you watch the HD video on a large screen monitor or tv, it looks like you are right there.  It is very compact and packs a lot of punch for your money - the low light video and pictures are amazing.  I am going to treat this WX150 camera like it is having an Uncle that is on \"life support\".  If you treat your Uncle really well,  take him out only on nice and sunny days, make sure he has ample supply of oxygen bottles to live, keep him clean and well looked after - theory is, that if you keep looking after your Uncle, he will keep looking after you - Your Uncle will be able to keep signing the \"cheques\" = the WX150 should last a long time with proper care (well, that is what I am hoping).  I am very happy with my purchase and hope the camera can last a long time because I love the performance this camera gives.  Thanks Uncle !Update**** - Have you ever tried to read the small \"warning\" print on the side of a triple AAA battery ?  I set up my WX150 on a tripod on one side of the house, on the other side of the house I put a AAA battery, lying down on top of a tote-box.  I shown my flourescent desk lamp (about 20 feet away from the battery) onto it.  I set the WX150 to \"program\" mode and set it to ISO 100, and to flourescent light setting. I zoomed in using the 40x zoom and I used the 2 second delay timer so the camera wouldn't shake and took a pic.  With the picture that was produced, I could read the small print on the side of the AAA battery that says \"warning - do not dispose of in garbage\"I also tried out the panoramic mode - really cool.  No more snapping individual pictures for the panoramic.  With the WX150, you position the camera where you want to start the panoramic and the push the shutter button once,  then slowly move the camera around to take in your entire view - the camera does everything else.  The result is a high quality panoramic picture.

The flash on this camera is so bright that the main subject looks pale and washed out.  After reading all the positive reviews, I am very disappointed with this.  Yes, you can manually turn down the flash, but this takes time and the camera seems to re-set itself the next time it is used.  Additionally, I don't feel I should HAVE to always turn down the flash level on an automatic camera.  The daylight pictures are fine; however, I think some of the example pictures were placed on Amazon by Sony employees, because I find them rather incredible, especially the light-house zoom picture.  If anyone has any advice for me, I'd be happy to receive it.  I was very excited about this purchase and this is such a disappointment; considering returning it.Update:  I finally had enough with this camera, so I contacted Sony to see what could be done.  The flash continued to be problematic, causing subjects to be very washed-out and pale looking.  The colors on all pictures are not true, either.  Sony stated it was too late to replace the camera, but stated I could send it in for repair.  I did so, and included examples of pictures I printed out that were taken with the Sony and also comparison pictures from my i-phone (which really should NOT be better pictures).  Sony's findings?  They sent the camera back to me stating \"no problems found.\"  At this point, I wrote a scathing email to Sony and I will never purchase another Sony product.  The camera is listed for sale and I will be purchasing a Canon, which I should have done in the first place.

Just be careful that the subject is not  moving.3. It takes great low light pictures. I mean it is good at low light that it actually can beat $800 Cannon SLR cameras. I went on a trip to Carlsbad Cavern and me and my friend who has a $800 cannon and took pictures. Later on we came to Hotel and compared and the SONY took better and clearer pictures that the Cannon. Then we went for  camping and at dark with some firepit, the SONY pictures came out better than the $800 Cannon!4. It takes great HD Video and the sound is great as well. I recorded a Acrobatic show in Beijing and it was great to watch it later from my SONY camera.5. The SONY battery lasts a long time.

My biggest complaint with this in comparison to the Canons I have owned is the necessity of charging the battery through the camera. The charger is not external. You can buy one, apparently, but I don't want to buy extra chargers for my camera. I like buying extra batteries to slide into my pocket or purse while traveling--12 hour days during vacation can challenge any camera battery if we are sightseeing enough. The issue of charging through the camera adds some inconvenience and/or cost to keeping those extra batteries handy.Overall, the size of the camera is great, very comparable to my beloved Canons. I like the large screen ratio to camera size but I wonder how it will hold up to abuse in my pocket. I also found menu navigation somewhat easier on this than on my Canon out of the box but the raised dial also worries me about it's durability. I cannot compare the MPs between the two since this Sony is newer and has even more as the cameras do each year. This also has more photo features that I need to experiment more with but overall the pictures it takes are great for a point and shoot. Over time and use I will decide if I prefer Sony cameras over Canon. Under average conditions, the photo quality is pretty equal. I have a feeling it's going to be about the features--Sony has more on this model than I've used in the past but I also wonder if it is overkill. After all, I want point and shoot.

The downside to this is that you feel you could break the camera just by using it. I also noticed there are some lose parts on the camera. For example the SD card/battery holder. The actual buttons on the camera are good. The are many setting on this camera for you to take the perfect photo(im not really going to go into all the settings).Quality of photos- I've only taking about 5 photos but the are pretty good quality. There is no light in the picture even if you took a picture of something in front of a window.Quality of videos- Like I said this was the main reason I bought this camera. The HD videos are amazing. However if your a Mac user, like me, videos won't import into iPhoto(which is annoying). So if you want to import videos you have to plug your camera into your Mac, go to iMovie and import form there. Also iMovie doesn't support 1080p videos, which is a huge letdown. So you'll have to buy a separate program for Mac, unless you own one, to have true HD videos.Overall- This is a good camera. Lots of settings, battery life is good, videos are great, and photos are great. The only downside is the camera is fragile, and Mac users might not like how iPhoto cant import videos.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good pictures but not well built", "Author": "R.

So much so that I just bought a second one in less than 6 months (as I stupidly lost the one I purchased this summer).This review will be on the camera I actually used for several months:I spent hours comparing reviews, features, and prices before I finally went with the cyber-shot dsc-wx150, even though it had been the favorite to week since early on in the race.At the top of my list was for high quality photos in different types of lighting (especially in dark lighting), and less blurry-ness and noise. I also wanted something small and portable, with decent zoom, video recording with sound, and fairly easy to use. Essentially, I was looking for a nice, compact point and shoot. Which the Sony CyberShot DSC-WX150, I got that and so much more.Some of the \"so much more\":-Taking photos while recording a video-Different photo effects, my favorite being all in black in white except shades of red. There are also settings to make it look like a painting, a watercolor, etc.-Panorama option-Saving photos on camera by date groupings, and thus also being able to delete by date.-Anti-blur and motion detection. Easy to take a shot while walking that wont come out blurry, and is great at catching movement, so you can catch that instant when they kick the ball, jump in the air, or anything and everything else.-Superior Auto: automatically detects the best scene setting, and takes 6 shots to combine into one final photo, on top of the regular features of the camera including anti-blur and motion detection, and the clarity of zoomed in photos. Upside: I hardly ever even think about checking photos after I take them to ensure they weren't blurry or hard to see (in the dark, I do check them more frequently)as I had to do constantly with my old camera; I know that they're going to be high quality because you get nothing less witih this camera. Downside: Slower shutter speed as there is a long processing time for each photo.The \"downsides\"--more accurately, minor grievances I sometimes note, but by no means deterrents to getting this camera.-Zoom speed/button. It could have been just on mine, but it would have a delay like it wasn't working, and then go in too much if it did work.-I have had mixed success taking photos of night scenes that have a lot of light in them, like a bridge lit up with streetposts or an illuminated fountain. This is more likely because of me, than the camera.All in all, you can't go wrong with this camera, except maybe more skilled photographers and enthusiasts who prefer DSLR's. Though for being a point-and-shoot, I'm sure it would be more than satisfactory. Absolutely worth the price.

First we were exited that the DSC-WX150 is very small, shots HD video and supposedly is very capable.

With the flash colors are better at a distance 6-12 or so feet; however,  at 2-4 feet flash just bleaches everything. On the other hand, the flash is not powerful enough for large distances like 15-20 feet.  We tried so-called \"easy mode\" and other modes which are plenty of and none works well for us. Many images are not in focus if shots are made without flash. The wheel that changes shooting modes could easily be accidentally moved to another position. The lens optics is probably of the low quality: in many pictures, faces are elongated  of other wise distorted. Movies are great but the Win XP transfer wizard doesn't recognize them. On the other hand, some service files and directories that are in the camera's memory always pops up during the transfer.Our old Sony DSC-W100 had none of these problems.

I can't believe it got the good reviews it did. Have those people never used a digital camera before? It takes 30+ seconds to ' process'  each picture.

I was on the fence about it due to mixed reviews. I have mainly used it for everyday pics of my cats and friends. I took it to the zoo this past Sunday and I got such amazing pictures. The color is so sharp and the zoom is beyond insane. Even when it goes into the digital zoom, most pictures on cameras would blur, mine were totally clear.It also takes pictures very fast. My old camera you had to hold the button down and it took a couple seconds to take it. This one snaps it in a second. Works well when people are in front of you and you need a quick picture.I also love the big LCD screen, such a must for me.A couple negatives - when I took pictures of a gorilla inside the zoo, the lighting was VERY dark. Even to the eye it was hard to see the features, just a black shape. I got a few pictures on my camera but then it started shutting off when I kept trying. It would turn back on when I'd face it away from that area but when I put it back it turned off again and wouldn't turn on until I moved away. I don't know if it was because it was so dark that it couldn't find anything to take a picture of? That was the only time that has happened so I'm thinking it had to be something like that. There were other dark areas, not as dark as that one and the camera was fine.Also my battery went dead after about 5 hours. Granted, I was using it almost constantly and I kept it on superior auto where it chooses which scene is best for that picture. So I don't know if that uses up more battery life? Plus it was kept on constantly, though after a couple minutes of no use it will shut itself off, so there was a lot of turning on and off.One other thing, when I transferred my pictures to my computer a few of the ones that were taken in darker lighting barely show up. On the camera itself they are clear but on the computer it's just dark shapes. It's only a few and I took over 200 pictures, but I was a little disappointed. It could be the memory card and not the camera though. I think that's more likely.I know it seems I have more negative than good things to say, but  I must stress strongly this is the best camera I've owned. My pictures are so amazing and I've had people online comment on how good they are. If it weren't for the fact that it is a lithium battery which costs more than rechargeable double A which is what my past cameras have taken, I wouldn't have even had a problem with it. I will definitely be buying another battery for it when I can afford it and have no thoughts on returning it. I am in love with this camera and can't say enough how awesome the pictures are. My friends were even saying the camera is pretty cheap for all it does.I'm not an expert camera user, just for everyday, concert, and outings such as the zoo and small trips. But this camera is beyond the best for it's price range.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "really good value!", "Author": "Ward J.
