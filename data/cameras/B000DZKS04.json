{"Reviews": [{"Title": "nervous at first, now, very excited about it", "Author": "poppyo", "ReviewID": "R1CVIGCDE79UED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before buying my first digital camera.  I wanted a quality camera, and I went back and forth between the $300+ and the under $150 camera's.  I chose this one because I figured at $140, 5MP, and 3x optical zoom, I would use it for a year and then get a new one and not feel gipped.  Well, the camera is so great!  I knew nothing about digital camera's, the instructions use language that I'm not familiar with, but the camera is very user friendly.  It takes some tinkering with, but it's easy to figure everything out.  Pictures come out crystal clear.  The different picture scene modes make for some creative pictures.  I travel a lot, I love to go out to the clubs and bars, party in the moonlight and dance till the sun rises, I love to do outdoor and indoor sports... this camera is light, small, I can keep it in my pocket, and it takes great pictures.  I have a mac computer, so the cd didn't load.. but all you have to do is connect the camera and the computer and an icon pops up.  Do a little copy and paste, easy.  The battery life is good.  I like the fact that it used AA batteries, because when travelling overseas, it's easy to buy batteries, and more difficult to make sure you find an outlet to charge your camera.  After about 4 days of using it continuously, the battery still was a little over 1/2 full.  I was a little concerned about the optical zoom, thought maybe I should invest in a camera that had more... well, after taking a picture of a house, I was able to zoom in and read the words on a post-it note on the front door- 3x is plenty!  I Highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "fantastic camera", "Author": "R. Gupta \"badmaash9911\"", "ReviewID": "RFLGT0OM0PNGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera.  I owned a pentax optio, which was very small, so I was hesitant to purchase this camera due to its somewhat larger size.  However, as the poster before me mentioned, this camera is not only small (not tiny though) and light weight, but it also takes really incredible pictures.  For under $150 this camera offers alot more than other cameras in the same price range and better quality pics.  One thing I would like to mention, aside from taking great standard night and day pics, is the ability to adjust the picture ratio.  On the second night out using this camera, I was able to fit all 6 of my friends in one shot, sitting comfortably on a sofa at a club (at the 16:9 ratio setting).  That really blew me away.  After careful research and consideration, I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Totally terrific camera!!!!", "Author": "S. Geisel", "ReviewID": "RJRHNCEQ1I2WD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is supposedly an entry level digital camera, but I have already found more cool bells and whistles than I will ever use. Since most of my photography is of performance horses, I was very interested in how the camera would handle the in motion pictures. The \"sports\" mode stops them in their tracks with totally terrific resolution. It is very easy to operate with on screen menus that really are effortless to use.The only thing I am diappointed in is the strap for carrying. It is so flimsy as to be useless.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "great first camera", "Author": "Steven P. Wood", "ReviewID": "R2KSAIOBW6J041", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Chicago and must say I'm very pleased overall. It's my first digital camera so I am still figuring out the intricacies of the many available options and modes, but even for an unskilled novice, the camera proved easy to use and took some great pictures. My friend used a far more expensive camera on the trip, and when comparing our photos afterward I was hard pressed to see any real differences in quality. I sneaked in the order in time and received the $129.95 deal, but even at $150.00, or whatever it is now, it remains a fine value. I recommend purchasing the 512 MB card, the carrying case, and the AC adapter (50 bucks) to complete the package.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "fun camera", "Author": "Karen Ehlebracht \"philosophy feline\"", "ReviewID": "R1YSC4X6KLG6ZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is easy to use and has great quality. You must purchase an additional memeory disk to hold photos because space for only 4 photos is on the factory camera.

The instruction manual is okay, I was a bit dissapointed in the rebound time it takes the camera to recover from taking a photograph. My Kodak cheapo Easy Share was better at rebound. The \"Burst\" feature that allows the person to take multiple pics in a row is still a bit difficult for me. I am mostly dissapointed in the size. This is not nearly close to a micro or mini sized camera but at least it isn't bulky and the price is very fair from Amazon. Hopefully I'll have a better review after owning it a month or so.

I used it for a couple years and it takes just as good of pictures as my current camera, which is 10 megapixels.  Battery life was horrible, even if you turned off the display, which I did often.

I was looking for a simple to use camera, so I pointed towards Kodak but found nothing to suit my taste. So I decided to try on Panasonic, and now I'm glad I did.First of all, the camera is easy to use. Mostly point and shoot. However, if you have special needs, the special settings are very helpful. It has a long time exposure setting that allowed me to a picture a lightning scenery with high detail . However, a tripod is a must if you want to enjoy this feature.Batteries? I used the Oxyride batteries that came included. Used them to set the camera up, fool around a little and  take about 150 pictures and maybe 20 minutes of video without flash. At least, it is not a battery eater when used with the oxyride batts.More goodies: of course. The camera is quick to start up, pictures easy to review and manipulate and the stabilization system really does work. Also, you can take this camera out of the bag and start using it without even looking at the instructions manual. However, I recommend reading it to fully understand some functions.The down side? Well, I have to say this: the videos are only recorded in QVGA (320 x 240) and they will have no sound.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "C.

My first one (an Olympus D-340R) still works even if it's a \"dinosaur\" when compared to today's digital cameras.  But I can no longer connect it to my computer (cable causes computer to reboot) and because it is so old I wanted to replace it ... or at least augment it with something newer.  I also had an old Sony handicam.  It also still works but... again.. it's old.. wanted something with newer technology.  Last year I thought I had replaced both by buying a Samsung SC-D365, but I discovered that it doesn't have a flash and even in the brightest indoor light the still pictures were too dark.  I wanted something on a par with my old Olympus, but didn't want to spend a lot of money since I'd already sunk quite a bit into the Samsung (which, btw takes okay outdoor pics/films).  I started looking for something around $100.00 and finally stumbled on the Panasonic DMC-LS2.  I read all the other owner reviews and was happy to see the majority gave it high marks.  It sounded like just what I was looking for.  What also helped at the time I bought it the price was just slightly over my $100 \"looking range\" ($130) and to sweeten the deal at that time, Amazon was also giving away 2 free memory cards to go with it.  So, I've had it about a week and have been trying it out (and reading the manual).  I was pleased to see that it was everything everyone's been saying and then some.  I took a few pictures using just the camera's internal memory and was amazed at how clear and sharp they were.  Took some really close up shots of one of my cats and could actually see each individual hair.  Amazing that this little mid-range camera can take such clear shots.  Of course, as I familiarize myself with it over time I will learn more about it's strengths (and weaknesses, if any), but so far it's exactly what I was looking for and I'm quite happy I found it.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "great  little camera", "Author": "DinoC", "ReviewID": "R28US2NSFTFTAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it.
