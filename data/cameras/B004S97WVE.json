Fletcher", "ReviewID": "R17FEM7RE9K165", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried a lot of security cams over the years and this is by the best ... and one of the cheapest.  NOTE:  After setting it up, you need to twist the lens cover to focus it on the area that you want to capture.  When I first installed it, I was unimpressed with the video quality.  Then I went to clean it one day and noticed that the lens cover turned.  Well, I turned it and the video got SUPER sharp ... duh!  The manual says nothing about focusing the camera!  However, once you dial this thing in one time, it is by far the sharpest image available.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unimpressed", "Author": "ns", "ReviewID": "R1SS3YVY2CMG2R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera can only do 15 FPS at any resolution.
