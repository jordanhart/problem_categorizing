Other than the occasional re-boot never had an issue.  This was the replacement.  Right away we never could get 33 of 36 computers to be able to access it (all 36 worked fine with the DCS-900).  Technical support was a joke, \"lower the security on the computers and remove the old activeX object installed by the DCS-900\".  Turning off security didn't help (like we were going to do that for any length of time).  We couldn't find and they couldn't say what the activeX object was we were supposed to be deleting (nice job, most reputable companies sign their objects).  Now the thing has gone totally toes up after just a couple of weeks.  Guess what, D-Link says no returns under any circumstances, deal with your vendor.  If we can't get it going in a day or so, hopefully Amazon will take it back/exchange it.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "D-Link DCS-5300 Review", "Author": "Terry L. Duff \"TDMusic\"", "ReviewID": "RLGNZH36ISVEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is excellent. I have retail stores 50 miles from me and I can watch my employees while I control the movement of the camera from my PC at home. There is no DVR necessary as the software is in the camera. It will move almost 360 degrees. However, be careful about which vendor you use. I have purchased 6 of these and the last two were older models although the model numbers were the same.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works well enough", "Author": "S. Wilensky", "ReviewID": "R1KID02BCHLF2O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was to replace my old D-Link 6620 camera which just quit working eafter about 1 year.  I figured why spend a fortune if they don't last.  This one is clearly a lower quality camera in every way.  The lack of an auto focus, or even a way to focus it from my PC, makes it nearly impossible to set up properly.  The low light ability is not as good either.  All I can say is it works...for now.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Do not buy - no after warranty repair available", "Author": "DS", "ReviewID": "R218OAHXINKNYS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a DCS-6620G and DCS-5300W. They both developed minor problems shortly after the 1 year warranty ran out. The DCS-6620G ethernet port failed and the DCS-5300G pan capability failed. I called DLink tech support and they told me that they will not repair these products or exchange them after the warranty, and that there are no authorized service centers. I escalated through 3 levels of tech support and then to US customer support and was given the same story and no way to get them repaired. The customer service lady stated that this was their policy on all products. They expect you to discard your $800 camera and buy another one. I recommend you don't buy any DLink product costing more that $100 - $200 as they are not very reliable and are disposable once they fail.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "okay when it works", "Author": "TLuke", "ReviewID": "R2O7U9JC4EK6QE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The DCS-5300 only works with Internet Explorer, which is okay.The DCS-5300 lets you remotely control the camera, which is okay.The DCS-5300 reboots itself every 24 hours from when you plugged it in, which is okay.My DCS-5300 doesn't always respond to the remote control requests, which is not okay, but it will reboot in 24 hours and some times that fixes this problem, so that makes it okay.It's just okay.
