It is the perfect \"lazy\" camera if you want more then a standard point-&-shoot but aren't ready to invest in a big DSLR. This camera does support other DSLR lens, but the one is comes with works beautifully. The bundle is alright, Haven't found the need yet to use the cleaners. The bag is not specifically for the camera, but still works. The SD card in the bundle is the right speed. Only thing I don't like is the extra battery it came with. It will charge to 100% in 2 hours, then when you use it the next day says it is at 30%.The sensor size on this camera is the same as the higher end Nikons and the Macro function is particularly good if you need close up shots/product shots.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Light and compact, great pictures!", "Author": "Luis Montesino G", "ReviewID": "R30DTETCAJW0AL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for a couple of weeks and am very happy with the ease of use and the great pictures it takes.. The automatic setting probably make it one of the best point and shoot cameras in the market, because in many different settings the pictures always look great. I definatly recommend this camera for for any one who wants more quality than what you get from all the regular point and shoot cameras on the market.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C7TBKM4"}}
