{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A510 vs A520 vs SDxxx", "Author": "diljs", "ReviewID": "R13VL6OPIGG3GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now. This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.The Axxx series is the successor to the excellent Axx series, with a few very useful upgrades, such as the switch from 4AA to 2AA batteries (with no decrease in camera life!), and the 4x optical zoom.A510 vs A520 vs SDxxxFirst off, the A510 and A520 are identical except for the 3.2 megapixel sensor in the A510 and 4mp on the A520. Today, megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but with today's cameras, it doesn't mean that much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image. In this case, the A510 has a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels, or an 8.5x11 picture. The A520 has a max resolution of 2272x1704 pixels, or a picture slightly larger than 8.5x11.Unless you need a slightly bigger picture, the A510 is a better buy.When it comes to the Axxx or an SDxxx, it depends on what you need. The Axxx series will give you a better picture quality, manual controls, and standard AA batteries which actually last twice as long as the SDxxx series' proprietary batteries. The SDxxx series will give you better movies, the new Dig!c 2 processor, and a compact, cool looking camera, at a higher cost and with a very fragile exposed LCD screen.Features:Pros:-Beautiful image quality, better than any other camera at this price range (no purple fringing like on the SDxxx)-4x optical zoom! It's very hard to find another camera in this class. This alone makes the camera superior to most of the competition-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Easy to hold naturally - no fingers in the way of the lens-Beautiful 1.8 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-The lcd is protected by a plastic layer, unlike the exposed and easily broken SDxxx lcds.-Uses AA batteries, which are cheap and easy to find instead of expensive proprietary batteries-Uses widely available and cheap SD or MMC cards (SD are faster)Cons (most of these are minor quirks):-Movie mode isn't as good as the SDxxx series-Only USB 1.1 transfer speed (SDxxx have usb 2.0)-Uses the still good, but outdated Dig!c processor, instead of the Dig!c 2 in the SDxxx series and some newer Canons-A historical problem for Canons still shows in this camera in the flimsy battery/Memory card coversIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card. The camera comes with a 16mb MMC card, which is pretty much useless. MMC cards are slower than SD, and 16mb will fill up very quickly.You should also consider a case, such as the very affordable and custom fit PC-65.Also, as with any camera, rechargeable NIMH batteries are a must. You don't need to pay for the expensive Canon set however, similar offerings from Energizer, Rayovac, etc. will work fine.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best selling digital camera series!", "Author": "superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"", "ReviewID": "REA9U072F9HS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon has fully redesigned the Powershot A series to make it lighter (uses only 2 AA batteries now), smaller and with 4x optical zoom.Pro's,1. Very good image quality.2. 4 MP and 4x optical zoom (A510, the 3.2MP version should be fine for most though).3. Priced right, unlike some overpriced digicams out there.4. Works on 2 normal AA batteries (buy rechargeable ones for extra life and lower cost), unlike expensive & hard-to-find propreitary batteries.5. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and scene modes.6. Battery and SD card doors seem to be of above average quality.7. 1.8\" LCD screen is bright and fluid.8. Uses standard SD cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card.9. Can attach extra lenses if one buys the adaptor for it.10. Actual LCD screen looks nicely protected below a plastic plate.Con's,1. The camera is still quite thick (although not bulky).2. It uses Digic instead of Digic2 processor in other new Canons.3. Tripod mount is on the corner and made from plastic.4. Doesn't have that cool-ness like iPod or Elph series.5. Nothing else different except extra MP from A510. Save your money and get the other one.I guess you gotta spend more money to buy Elph series for more pocketability & style. I am almost sure this will be THE best selling camera series of 2005, just like A60 & A75 in past. With a price this low for a fully loaded A510/A520 there really is no reason to buy slightly cheaper but vastly inferior cameras from HP, Kodak, Olympus, Fuji or Samsung.

After extensive research on the net looking at prices and reviews, I really thought that their wasn't a camera for me, one that I would be happy with. Most Digital cameras on the market, for consumers, are these really small things that are fully automatic and have limited capabilities. And to add the to the previous statement, really really expensive. Olympus offered some nice cameras with 10x Zoom lens, at a reasonable price, but if you look deeper you'll find that it uses these tiny rechargable batteries. Two reasons why I do not like those, the main reason is cost. They cost a bit and you cant do with just one, you have to atleast buy several. Another reason, (which is quite big) is that if you somewhere were you're not going to get access to a power source then you're screwed when you run out of batteries.O.k. so I finally got two decent cameras that fit basically my needs, and they both happen to be Canon. The Powershot A520, and the PowerShot A95. So now to explain why I chose the former. The main reason was \"Cost\". The A520 was quite allot cheaper than the A95, (err, around $80-$100/\u00a58,000-\u00a510,000). The secound thing that I was looking for was Image quality, both are great, i mean really! But the A95 came out slightly higher. Next thing was Manual controls. Both met that one with flying colors. And then there was Optical Zoom, A520 was the winner here. Then there was which one was newer? (not a big deal but still, the newer the better) The A520 was newer. Which one felt nice in the hands, looked nicer? The A520 in my opinion. Which one was lighter/smaller (I never really looked for that, but when it came down to the A520, and A95 it did) the A520 was.So those were the main reasons that I looked to compare with the two cameras. The main reason was which one was cheaper, and in the end I decided to go with the A520, and I deffinetely think I made the right choice.I was able to buy the A520, with a 512mb High Speed (the fastest one there was, read 20mb/s) Buffalo SD card (around 220 pics, Large and Superfine). A520 Case, 4 rechargable NiMH batteries (one of the, if not the best there was). And a A520 Lens Adapter, for the same price if Id bought the A95 by itself (the SD card was the expensive one).The major difference between the A520, and the A95 besides the extra megapixel is that the A95 was faster at taking and saving pictures. Thats is why I bought the extremely fast SD card, making the A520 a fast little bugger. The major downfall of the A520 which is the only reason I see customers going for other cameras is the time that it takes to reload the flash. Its quite allong time.... But really if you think about it, and if you get to know your camera better and its manual controls, the only time you need your flash is at night or indoors. Neither of those settings requires you to quickly capture a little critter jumping from one shrubbery to another. You can take great pictures with-out using the flash, and just adjusting the shutter speed and Aperture, and if you really need to the ISO.So I chose the A520 and I love it! (Pros)I love its small size,I love its great quality pictures,I love its manual controls and many pre-settings.I love that it takes only two batteries and has great battery life with the NiMHs.I love its 4x Optical Zoom.I love that you can get other lenses to atach on.I love its design.I also dislike (Cons)I hate its really really slow \"flash charging\".I dislike its Optical View finder, it only covers 81% of the actuall picture!", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great camera with some major downfalls.", "Author": "S. Halberg \"shalberg\"", "ReviewID": "R1OBR1691YDY51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get this camera because all of the features it has, and it has a ton.  I liked the feel of the camera in my hand, though the camera itself is smaller than I would have liked.  Still, the controls were easy to access, and the weight of it felt good in my hand.  It looks to be quite a sturdy camera.  The 4X zoom is great, the colors are brignt yet natural, and the screen quality is pretty good.But despite all the strong points this camera has, the negatives were enough that I returned the camera.  I found ALL the images were overprocessed and needed sharpenening when editing the photos on my computer.  One of the reasons I am in the market for a new camera is because my current digital camera now produces images that need to be shaprened, and it is annoying to go through every single picture and adjust it.  Many (%80) of my pictures needed red-eye adjustment when a person was not looking directly at the camera.  I found the start up to be too slow, the focus was too slow, shot-to-shot lag time was too slow, and (the biggest negative in my opinion) the flash recycle was WAY too slow.  The screen goes black for 6 to 12 seconds after taking a shot with a flash, depending on your battery charge.  It was incredibly annoying, and one of the major reasons I returned the camera.  I missed a lot of great shots waiting for the flash to recycle.Overall, the camera has a lot of great features that I really liked.  However, the negatives were so major that I couldn't see spending money on a new camera that would just frustrate me, especially when I am buying new camera to replace the one that is breaking down...and frustrating me!", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "D. Sivley \"D\"", "ReviewID": "RR8LARXSYY6KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've just taken the first 133 pictures.  They are all great!  The flash is incredible for such a small camera.  The picture quality is real good, even when zooming in on my computer display screen.  I am really impressed with the color and light balance in the interior pictures I took, which usually challenge many 35mm automatic cameras.  Outdoor pictures are not usually a problem with any.  I bought a 512 MB SanDisk memory card.  I took the 141 pictures on the first set of AA batteries.  So I am going to get some rechargeable ones.  The nice part about AA, is that if I am out somewhere, and need some working batteries fast, I can just buy them.  Otherwise, recharge is cheap.  I've got $214.94 in the camera plus $44.99 for the extra memory card ($265 total, including shipping).  The camera comes with a USB cord to instantly download picture to the internet.  It also comes with an A/V cord, so you can just show the pictures directly from your camera to a TV.  This is a great feature when you are on vacation, and want to look at full size pictures before returning home to your computer.  The camera screen is 2\", and does fine.  I had no trouble holding the camera still enough to get excellent pictures.  And it is small enough to fit in my jeans pocket - although I wouldn't want it there all the time.  Add a small $5 gadget bag to put the cords, extra batteries, charger, and camera in - you're ready to go!

It's my first digital camera - I've used regular film for years.  I was able to take pictures with it straight out of the box, 2 minutes after buying the camera.I like how it has a lot of manual controls but you don't need to use them unless you want to because \"Auto\" does a pretty good job with photos.  At first I stuck to Auto mode but I've been using the manual controls more and more as I learn them, and I'm sure I won't be able to go back to a camera without them ever again.  This camera is flexible enough for creativity, but easy enough to hand to a friend to take a quick snapshot.The 4x optical zoom is great - more than the standard 3x offered on most cameras.  The image quality is top-notch and is truly stunning for a camera in this price range.  The LCD \"gains up\" in low light and is easy to use to frame shots, but you still have the useful optical viewfinder as a backup.  The camera is 4 megapixels, which is a good \"compromise\" size because it allows cropping and still good prints up to 8x10.I've seen complaints about redeye and difficulty in low-light focusing on other review sites, but I have yet to encounter any major problems. My indoor flash shots at a restaurant had some redeye, sure, but it was WAY less than I used to get with my my old film camera, and I found the photos came out clear and sharp.  Night shots without the flash are also easy to take, because you can slow the shutter speed right down.  All the scene modes seem to do what they're supposed to.A few minor gripes: the LCD is difficult to see in bright sunlight.  The camera literally eats AA batteries, so I recommend picking up some rechargeable NiMH batteries instead.  And the movie mode - while cool - isn't all that wonderful because you can only take 30 second clips and they look grainy.  But hey, it's a film camera, not a digital one.  Also, the recharge time after flash photos is a bit slow.  And images are a bit noisier than I'd like, especially at ISO 200 or above.To summarize:Pros:-Fantastic image quality-Compact, portable and ergonomically designed-Uses 2xAA batteries, which is really convenient especially for travel-GREAT battery life with NiMH rechargeables-4x optical zoom-Lots of scene modes-Full manual controls (aperture, shutter speed, white balance including custom, ISO, exposure)-Pretty powerful built-in flash that \"zooms\" with the camera to focus light on the subject at telephoto end of the lens-AF-assist lamp for better low-light focusing; LCD visible in low light-Nice software packaged with the camera that's easy to useCons:-Camera literally eats AA alkaline batteries; rechargeables are more or less a must-Movie mode leaves something to be desired-Uses DIGIC processor instead of newer, faster DIGIC II, which leads to slightly sluggish performance, especially on flash recycle and shot-to-shot delay-Images a bit noisier than I'd like to see at ISO 200 and above-4 megapixels is adequate for most needs but most newer cameras have 5-7 these daysAs you can see, I'm very happy with the camera. I think it offers a great range of features and quality for the price, and I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good all-around usage digital camera.", "Date": "April 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Avoid; E18 error very common.", "Author": "madeinusa", "ReviewID": "R3PPOPFD5RHRSO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera and all Canon A-series cameras should be avoided.

I was going to stick with the A510 but upon hearing the A520 was lighter, smaller and used 2 batteries as opposed to 4 I decided to take the plunge.There is a TON to like about the camera. The pictures it takes are excellent, the most important aspect of a digital camera. The controls are very intuative, and I find it to be the perfect size for a grown man. There are smaller cameras out there, but having used them I find it difficult to hold them steady and keep my fingers out of the way of the lens. The number of accessories for the A520 (and A510) is second to none for anything it's class (and above). Lenses, flash packs, underwater skin, etc.. are all very readily available. Most excellent.Now, for my complaints. I wish the processor was faster. It definetly is slower in compressing and storing the photo than my friends modern digital cameras (3 and 4 MP cameras of the past year or so). My other complaint is in Canon software. I had no intention on actually using the included software to download pictures. On every other digital camera I have attached to my computer, the memory card appeared under \"My Computer\" and I could freely move or copy pictures from the memory card. Not possible with the Canon A520. I was forced to install the TWAIN software for the camera, which does work fine with the Canon downloading program. Unfortunetly the included TWAIN driver crashes Picasa which is my picture manager of choice. Sigh.A great price for a very good camera. I'm not sure I would buy it again if I had to do it over again.

The actual trend is very much directed to make digital cameras smaller every time, but nonetheless this one has a good size. It is not one of the tiny little narrow ones, but it is not bulky either. It is narrower than it's older brothers on the \"A\" series from Canon, because it uses two AA batteries instead of four. It will still fit in your jacket pocket.Some people call this the Canon \"economic\" series. I think that is true if you compare them to the Digital Elph series, and this is mostly because of the use of plastic cases and several plastic parts instead of metal. Like one reviewer stated, the tripod mount is made out of plastic, and yes, I don't understand why it is in the corner. If your tripod is very light and the tripod head is small, it might cause the camera to tilt to the side and find it difficult to make it sit straight. To me this is a major flaw which I noticed at once at the moment of using a tripod, which I do often. You have to be real careful when you screw it on and off the tripod, frequent use might wear the plastic screw receiver.You also have to be careful when you pull up the rubber strip that covers the inputs and outputs to transfer your pictures to your computer or view them on your TV screen. If you pull it too far back, this may cause the little rubber hinge that attaches it to the camera to break, with which you will loose this cover forever and beyond repair. I have seen this system before on several cameras and camcorders of different brand names and I think it is too fragile and should be changed.This are maybe the main reasons I did'nt give it five stars, because otherwise, I am very much pleased with mine. I got it about four months ago and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I had a Nikon 3100 for two years before the Canon, and I liked it a lot, but I must say this is a better camera overall.The fact that it has a Digic processor instead of a Digic2, like more expensive models, is true; but hardly noticeable by most users, given the excellent picture quality that it delivers.The 1,8 inch display has a very nice size and is very clear under most light conditions. It does'nt scratch easily, which did happen with the Nikon 3100 (read my review on this).Battery life is great. Last weekend I took more than 200 pictures  in the M1 setting which is 1600x1200 quality, the second larger available (it fills your computer screen), on a single pair of AA rechargeables, and they are still going.I very much recomend the wide angle snap-on lens that you can get from Amazon at... 20 bucks!! It makes a world of difference when you are shooting landscapes or... whatever!! Besides a memory card (I use a 256MB and it stores hundreds of pictures), a carrying case (it does protect your camera), and a battery  charger (it WILL save you a lot of money), this is definitely the best accessory you can buy.The camera has a huge menu of manual settings, effects, scene modes and more that, I must admit, I haven'nt figured out or used totally yet.

Hope the camera remains under warranty till the time this happens &*(^%$#The body is flimsy and so is the place to hold the AA batteries. It can break if you mishandle the camera a bit. Suffice it to say it is not robustAnd finally the thing sucks up batteries like its main function is to finish these up even when you are not using the flash.In summary no matter what you hear of Canon and its Quality Assurance practices dont buy this model.

The camera takes good picutes and has many exposure options. Being able to use standard AA batteries is especially useful if you're traveling or outdoors and don't have ready access to a charger. I have been using a Dimage X for the past 3 years and have been very happy with it; however, the Dimage provides relatively few exposure options and movies are limited to about 20-30 seconds. The Canon offers many more features.So far I have found 2 major drawbacks with the Canon A520:1. You can't zoom while making a movie. The 3-year-old Dimage provides this feature. This is frustrating, because while the Canon provides seemingly unlimited recording time compared with the Dimage you don't get enough control while filming.2. The Canon does not emulate a Windows disk drive when you connect it to a computer. To download picutres you have to install special software that Canon provides or use another program compatible with the TWAIN standard. This is a big inconvenience if you want to use the camera on different computers, as I often do. (I have sometimes used the Dimage as a USB disk to share files with others while traveling on business.) Copying images with the Canon software works ok, but it seems slow - and that's one more piece of software that you have to install and manage. When I connected the camera to a computer that lacked the Canon software, but had Adobe Photoshop Elements, I could use Elements to get the images - but it took forever: don't just go out for a cup of coffee; take a long lunch.If these 2 features aren't important to you by all means consider the Canon A520.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Once again, Canon is the master.", "Author": "Christina.Whiskhands", "ReviewID": "R2M6SZQQQ9YBRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my first digital camera in 2001: a Canon PowerShot A10, with 1.3 MP.

Since I have gotten this digital camera I have never waited around for expensive film to be developed, but instead I print out my pictures right at home. This product comes with software that allows me to format and manipulate pictures the way I would like them to be. The crystal clear 1.8-inch display shows me the picture I have taken within seconds whereas many other brands and models like the Samsung Maxima don't even have a screen to view the moment I just captured. The convenient switch from taking to viewing pictures just takes the flick of a switch. While the screen may not be as large as the 2.5-inch screen of the Olympus SP-350, it gets the job done. Size does matter when it comes to cameras, the smaller the better. You don't want a big, bulky one to carry around during family picnics and Christmas gatherings. The A520 model is wide but not awkward compared to the Canon A610 at a massive 2.9 pounds. Zooming in is exceptional for a camera of this small size; this camera may not have the focus of a professional photographer's camera, but it is perfect for those in-the-moment party pics. Many would expect the above features to be standard, but the random, personal features are a bonus. This camera allows you to choose themes for your camera like planets or birds. These themes allow for fun sound effects when taking and viewing photos. The thirteen different modes may also seem like a bonus, but they're not necessary.  These modes let you chose the setting you are taking a picture in to get the optimum quality. Thirteen is a bit much if you ask me; I just leave it on auto, which works well enough.

After getting it home I messed around with it (even read the manual, amazing what kind of information you can find there), taking probably 150-200 photos, checking out exposure etc. and it seemed to work and I was impressed with the quality of the pics and the ability to manipulate the exposure. The control of exposure is remarkably similar to my old Elan II 35mm.

I pressed the button to turn the camera on and found the lens cover only a quarter open. Turned it on and off and it was fixed, I thought. Once in Bali it continued to hang up every once and while for the next day or two but it was tolerable, and we are on vacation (good), long way from home (good) 't too many camera repair shops there (bad).A couple of days later another problem cropped up, it wouldn't retract the lens when you turned it off. Ok, I could just push it in.A day later, it wouldn't obviously focus so it wouldn't take the picture, very frustrating. After getting back home I found that even photos that looked in focus on the LCD were actually out of focus but just a little. Shortly after that the zoom quit working too. And we still had three weeks left. GroanWhat to do? We tried finding a repair shop in several towns but to no avail. We soldiered on with it screwing up regularly and with us getting a couple of decent photos here and there. We also looked at shops to buy a replacement. As an aside. Why don't cameras cost less in Southeast Asia? You think they would. The A520 is made in Malaysia, about 3 hours away from where we were. We never found any better deals than what you can find here and usually it the same camera was significantly more expensive????On the next to last day in Indonesia it completely broke down, with the lens stuck almost all the way back in. We were without a camera for those two days and the three we spent in Hong Kong. And us with no camera to document the 15-hour flight back to JFK.

Message to others, don't even try to use alkaline batteries.

I had no idea it was such a highly rated/high tech/quality camera! The bottom line is, this is an absolutely FABULOUS, easy to use, dummy can-do camera! BTW, the features I knew to look for were:1) Decent MP resolution (ie 3 or above, which just isn't an issue anymore- any/all 'real' cameras have at least 3 MP resolution, this one has 4. In laymen's terms this means how many tiny grains per area, or how 'sharp' the photo quality will be- allowing for larger pictures overall to be nice & sharp, vs. photographed subjects/objects 'dulled' at the edges).2) OPTICAL zoom resolution, at least 3 or 4X. This Canan PowerShot A520 has $X OPTICAL zoom. Again, in laymen's terms, this means an actual zoom lens that you can adust from where your'e standing in relation to the subject of the picture your'e taking. So you can zoom right in on that mean eating lion, & make it look like your'e in the cage with him at the zoo. Alternatively, you can zoom out, and take a more panoramic (larger range) photo. Digital zoom resolution, on the other hand, simply means that the camera's software zooms in- it's really practically a meaningless term- of course a digital camera has digital zoom! You really want to make sure you have OPTICAL zoom. Decent cameras have both. Cheap/undesireable camera's have ONLY digital zoom.3) Battery type- some accept only hard to find/expensive to replace batteries (Sony is guilty & known for this- apparently thinking the Sony name can carry them to additional profits by requiring only Sony-specific batteries, counting on clueless people like me who just unquestioningly have trusted the Sony name over the years... No more!) This Canon PowerShot accepts readily available non-name rechargeables, and/or drugstore AA's. Battery power is decently long lasting, DEFINITELY bring along spare/back-ups for any important event, or for a trip. (Or just bring your second set of rechargeables, camera takes 2, 4 fit in a standard re-charger). I'm realizing that after a year, my rechargeables have about outlived their re-chargeable capacity, & I just need to purchase a replacement: ~10-$20. NBD for a year's worth of picture taking!3) Ease of software installation & use: Self explanatory. Couldn't be simpler! Easy to initially load camera software & plug in using USB port (you need to make sure your'e using a decent/recent PC- if it's more than a few years old (this means 2 or 3 years at most!), your Desktop is outdated, and you'll likely have compatibility problems- this means you'll spend hours becoming increasingly frustrated because your'e too cheap to buy a decent, entry level PC, & your camera will not work with your computer.  Provided your PC & your camera are compatible (if unsure, call Canon before buying, or before opening packaging, to ask!), it's SO easy to install software/configure camera, take & upload pictures, learn to modify them in all sorts of ways to improve them, etc., easy to attach them as e-mail attachments &/or send photo's independantly, etc.  This is really a 4 year college degree in itself. But you can easily learn & use the basics, such as red-eye elimination, cropping photo's, etc.  If you do run into software/useability problems, just call Canon right away for technical assist. (Make sure you call RIGHT away- after the return period has elapsed, & later the warranty period, they're less & less desireous of helping you). This has a zillion photo settings, including a highlighted 'Auto' selection- Hello! Works great!4) Lightweight, small (fits in purse), wrist strap, easy to carry with you without severely weighing you down. Feels 'right' in the hand to snap photo's.5) GREAT sized screen on back for both original picture taking- can use either actual eye-view hole, OR the digital screen, to see what your'e photographing. ALSO needless to say, this screen is FABULOUS for playback/review. You can set it a gazillion different speeds, as well as other options- I just left it at the factory setting, works great!6) THIS AMAZING LITTLE CAMERA EVEN HAS BRIEF 'MOVIE MODE'! You can take up to 3 minutes of sound enhanced movies-my daughter LUVS this feature! (It's a power hog though, to use this function). Works great! Camera itself has limited memory capacity, and a card slot for insertion of a 512 MB (or up to 1G? Unknown?) for dramatically increased memory capacity- translation- you can take & store a lot of pic's, using a memory card (VERY readily available & inexpensive), before the card is full, & then you have to stop, upload those stored pics on your PC, clear ('reformat') the memory card, & start anew.

No need to have a matching 'Canon' printer, although they're good too- I have just an inexpensive HP printer/copier/scanner (digital, not laser), it produces incredible quality, color saturated, high resolution photo's! (Tip- while your'e learning, set the printer setting to 'fast draft'- this will use dramatically less ink & produce a much less color saturated picture, while your'e getting the hang of it. Once your'e ready, change the printer setting to a higher level, & you'll get a more colorful, professional looking photo.) I've found that of the 3 printer settings, using the highest level just plain pours out the ink, wastes ink, saturates paper, smears before drying, etc. So I just use the middle setting.I'm tired now, this camera is FABULOUS beyond my expectations!

Great quality pictures, the optical zoom is great (4x instead of 3x with most cameras in this range), the lag time on saving pics might be a little slow but unless you are constantly taking multiple 'action' pictures with continuous frames there is no need for those. Pay NO ATTENTION to those who complain about about the picture to picture lag time....if they want to 'snap' continuous frames of let's say a soccer game....then get a camcorder.

It's one of those things that 2 AA's are great in order to keep the camera small but then you have an energy problem. Get a camera case that allows the extra space to carry extra AAs.

If they get a little dust on them, they are ruined. Next, the battery life is horrible although, if you buy the Energizer lithium batteries they do last a little longer. You have to take the batteries out of the camera when stored away because for some reason it will drain the batteries in the off mode. When needing the flash, you have to wait ten to fifteen seconds for it to recharge. Then there's the most aggrivating feature of the camera, the lense retracting mechanism. On every A series camera I've used, this part is pretty much the death of the camera. It's the E18 lens error horror story.

In the 3 years that we have owned this camera we haven't had too many problems.  This camera is a great camera for a family or someone who wants to take \"casual pictures\".  I don't recommend this camera for someone looking for profession landscapes or other high quality photos.  Otherwise, saying that, it takes great pictures for the photo album of family vacations or of a first birthday.  Photos of faces have great detail!  Onto the pros and cons:Pros:Lightweight and durableFits well in the handShort and longer timer settingsDifferent photo settings to choose from (videos, fast motion, landscapes, people, etc)Spot for a tripod connectionTaking videos is a breeze...even has decent sound quality.You can view the videos and photos right on the camera...it even allows for you to zoom in fairly well to see more detailsEasy to useEasy setup to transfer pictures from the camera to PCI am sure there are more, but I am not big on remembering the zoom statistics...Cons:Taking pictures in a lower light setting (even with the flash on) isn't that great of qualityAfter 3 years I have found that older rechargeable batteries aren't working as well, but this is solved with purchasing new rechargeable batteries.Other solutions for batteries...definitely buy rechargeable batteries.  I also found that if you take the batteries (of any kind) out of the camera when you are done using it, the batteries will last longer.  Now that last suggestion may not be for everyone, especially if you want to be able to grab your camera for a quick picture...but I would really recommend taking your batteries out if you are packing them for a trip or won't be using it for a while.  This way when you go to use your camera again you won't be stuck with a \"low battery\" message.Other suggestions...buy the case for it too.
