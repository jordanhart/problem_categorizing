{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent as a first digital camera.", "Author": "James Arvo", "ReviewID": "R1G3HW0UKE6INA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are considering the Sony P10, you are probably looking for your first digital camera.  If so, you are considering a very worthwhile purchase, both in the abstract (acquiring a digital camera) and in the concrete (the Sony P10). I've had a P9--the previous model--for about six months, and I am extremely pleased with it.  I often comment that it has \"changed my life.\"  (More on that below.)  First, here are the features I really like about the P9:__ 1) Very small (fits in your pocket).__ 2) Great resolution (5.0 megapixels is very nice).__ 3) Delay after pressing shutter button is quite short.__ 4) Good selection of features, which are easy to access.__ 5) Very easy to download images to your computer.__ 6) Memory sticks are very compact and have multiple uses.If you are new to digital photography, #3 will come as a surprise to you. Be sure to check this on any digital camera you consider!  Some have a delay of close to a second, and it will drive you crazy if you intend to photograph anything but static objects (i.e. NO people).  With regard to memory sticks, I'm a big fan.  They are very small and can be used in other devices such as camcorders, computers, and voice recorders.There are a few things that could be improved in the P9, although these things do not seem to be appreciably better in other models that I've considered, and are often significantly worse. Here are the things that could be better:__ 1) Built-in flash is terrible (as are all built-in flashes).__ 2) No connector for an external flash.  (Argh!)__ 3) Annoying delay after pressing the on/off button.__ 4) High capacity memory sticks (over 128 MB) are expensive.With respect to the flash, I think it is best to think of the P9 as having no flash at all.  If you don't mind having everything look flat, with stark shadows, go ahead and use the flash.  Otherwise, you are much better off using natural light--the brighter the better.  (Note: low light images are grainer, and consume more memory as the compression algorithms are less effective on grainy images.) I would really ding the P9 for this, if it were not that every point-and-click camera I've ever seen, digital or otherwise, has a similarly pathetic flash.  (Why can no manufacturer get this right?  Simply being able to bounce the light off the ceiling would help immeasurably!) Finally, when you hit the on/off button, there is a delay of several seconds before you get any indication that the camera is going to turn on/off.  This can be very confusing, especially since the button provides no tactile feedback!Now, a few comments to newbie digital photographers (as I was six months ago). I'm sure you can already list some of the obvious advantages of digital photography: 1) You can preview them on-the-spot, 2) You need only keep the ones you like, 3) You can store them on your computer, email them, and post them on the web very easily (i.e. no scanning).  But, is this all hype, or does it really make a difference?  My answer is this: It makes a FAR GREATER difference than you can begin to anticipate!  To me the difference is so significant that I can scarcely compare digital and conventional photography.  They are distinct activities. As proof of this, I now take (conservatively) ten times more photos than I used to, and I continually view them, compose them, and share them using my computer.  All of these things are possible with conventional photography, just like it's possible to walk ten miles to work rather than drive.  You could do those things; you just won't.  Admit it, you're human.Whether you buy the P10 or not, do yourself a huge favor and purchase a digital camera (especially if you have kids).  You'll wonder why you waited so long to take the plunge.", "Date": "July 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "best camera for printing big pics", "Author": "S.

This can only be seen on the screen and not in the view finder. The video compression works well but fast motion may seem a little jerky. Almost 6 minutes of VGA fits on a 128 meg card. A 256 meg card goes for as little as [money amount]plus shipping on the net. Camera allows dividing video and deleting unwanted side for reducing memory use. Zoom function does not work during video probably bewcause of noise or focus issues. There is also an email quality video mode which will give  90 minutes of recording with adequate sound.This allows recording a lecture or interview in video with sound! The included software seems to only allow saving editing to MPEG1 which is computer only. I don't understand this. Maybe they want to sell something else. Don't get stuck with a lot of work you can't put on a video disk and look into other software.On the web you can download Projector Station 4.1 which is for putting  jpeg images into xga format and into a file on a memory stick card for projectors. This allows about 500 images onto a 128 meg card in a file that can be accessed from your camera. When you are visiting the relatives you can bring all of your family photos in the camera for playing on the tv with the video output cable supplied. If they have windows xp the camera will allow you to hook up with only the cable w/o any software and and have camera memory show as a drive. You can copy any pictures you want to other computer. Very 2K!The battery really lasts quite well and the camera will tell you how much time is left on it. You can also purchase extended life batteries. The long cords on the charger are awkward and it must plug into the camera to charge battery. An external charger would be convenient.Camera will stay contiuously in focus allowing a much quicker shutter response than other cameras. Using the manual distance setting speeds things up also. You can edit still pictures by zooming in during preview and then cropping what isn't in the screen. You can also make lower resolution copies of pictures for emails.The camera takes surprising quality shots in low light without the flash. I am guessing that it somehow processes the images to avoid some of the low shutter blur.

I have never had a problem with anything Sony I've ever owned--and this camera is no exception.  It boasts 5 megapixel pictures, countless features, good looks--in a package small enough to drop in your pocket--amazing.  Menu is easy to navigate, read and understand.  We upgraded immediately to a 128 meg card, although we wanted to get the 256--we opted not to deal with the copyright issues on the memory stick pro cards.  It seems some photography stores can't develop pictures from those protected cards--not good.  You can get a nice 128 for about $... now!...  Other options include upgraded lenses, tripods and other toys you can grow into--very nice indeed!  We have been told by some very knowledgable industry folks that we may never have to buy another digital camera again!  Overall--we are very happy with this Sony DSC-P10--we can't wait to start booking vacations!", "Date": "June 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Corrections for the reviewers who wrote incorrect things", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "RINN24GZE13ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I was reading some of the reviews posted for this camera, I felt compelled to clarify some of the glaring errors in other reviews. For my complete review, please scroll down.maflleje complained thoroughly about how there is no black and white shooting mode. Despite claiming to be an \"advanced point and shoot user\" he still has not figured out the basics. Turn the dial to SCN and press \"menu\", it's right there. You can even shoot in Sepia, negative and many other modes that have come with Sony's for a long time.Another incorrect statement is that burst mode takes 3 pictures in succession, when it can actually take up to 16. Also, the lack of a swivel LCD is also irrelevant, because the only digital camera that comes with that also happens to be terrible. The Nikon coolpix has a swivel LCD, and I have never seen such awful pictures from a digital camera as I have seen from that coolpix. And no, the included 32MB stick cannot take 32 pictures in 5 megapixel mode, it takes less than 10. My 256MB card can hold 100 pictures in 5 megapixel mode, therefore 128's can hold 50, etc...Also, one of the best memory sticks also happens to be very hard to find in the search. Search for \"Sony MSA128S2 256 MB\" on amazon. It's cheap, fast, and sony brand.Another ridiculous comment is that you can't delete pictures from your camera from windows explorer. I think that person just needs to learn how to use windows. Simply click \"move files to different location\" which is in the upper right of the window, and after moving the pictures to whatever folder they are automatically deleted off the camera.Another person complained about having to buy a memory stick reader. Any memory reader is the most useless thing ever and a complete waste of money. You can already leave your memory stick in your camera and then plug that directly into the computer. With a memory stick reader you take the memory stick out of the camera and plug it into the reader which plugs into the computer. THAT IS THE EXACT SAME THING.Also, people have complained about the included 32MB memory stick. Almost all other leading manufacturers don't include any memory at all. Nikon, Fuji, and Canon do not come with compactflash cards, and some Kodak's come with small internal memory. So be thankful that you get anything at all from Sony, it's a good way to start.Also, one person complained about a lack of a 2 megapixel setting on the camera, making it slow to upload pictures online via dialup. If you post your pictures to MSN groups or many other sites, they automatically truncate the pictures for you, so you don't have to reduce them to that size. On top of that, you could even use the included 1 megapixel setting if you have dialup, because 1 megapixel looks almost exactly the same as a 5 megapixel when printed or viewed in 4 X 6 format.So, unless you're an absolute hardcore professional, this camera is awesome and is almost for everyone. If you're pro, go for a Canon rebel Ti digital or Sony V1. Otherwise please do not make baseless incorrect complaints about my favorite camera.", "Date": "December 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable pictures and great features!", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "R1RQRVA4NWZOFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a digital camera user for over 5 years now and I have been fortunate enough to experience a variety of cameras including the Kodak DC 240, Canon A400, Canon S30/S45, Nikon Coolpix 3100, Kodak DX6340, and finally Sony P10. Let me just say that the P10 takes by far the best pictures and it's compact size can easily fit into your pocket. Of all the digital cameras I have used they all have varying degrees of lightning problems, but the Sony P10 has the best looking night pictures of the group. The P10 comes with a lithium ion battery that lasts way longer than the conventional Nickel metal-hydride batteries other cameras use. I believe it is most useful to compare this camera to the competition. Almost all Kodak cameras include a one time use battery that cannot be recharged. In fact, you cannot even put in a lithium ion battery into any Kodak except for the very top model. A lithium ion battery is almost essential for digital cameras since they use so much power. If anything other than Lithium ion is used, you will be changing batteries every 10 minutes. I ended up returning the Kodak to amazon.com for this reason alone.Canon digital cameras include a lithium ion battery but my biggest gripe about Canon's are poor quality pictures indoor or night conditions. Many pictures were taken in a cave with one of those compact Canon cameras and they looked awful when compared to the Sony. The Canon S45 is far too big and heavy and the indoor pictures are only mediocre.My friend has a Nikon coolpix 3100 and for a brand that professionals use, this camera has the worst lighting problems of any digital camera I have ever seen. In fact, the lighting issues were so terrible that even my five year old Kodak DC 240 looked way better.Olympus cameras are okay only that they do not come with Lithium ion batteries, but you can buy those separately at least, unlike Kodak.The reason I do not mention the many types of shooting modes each camera has is because they are relatively the same. The Sony comes with a lot of features including Night Shot, night shot with a person in the foreground, multi-burst shooting which is useful for sports (you can take up to 16 consecutive images of things like a baseball swing), it even has special modes for taking pictures of water and a separage mode for snow.The great thing about this camera is, it's perfect for amateurs and people a little more advanced. All the pictures I've taken so far look great in point and shoot mode, but it also allows you to adjust the shutter speed, white balance, and much more for people who are into that sort of thing.I found the controls for the Sony P10 very intuitive. For all the basic controls I didn't have to consult the manual. The controls are not as intuitive on the Canon S45, it's a little weird, and the Nikon coolpix doesn't record sound in the movies. Most Kodak's play back movies and pictures with the lens open and out, which I think is stupid because then you risk damaging the lens when you don't have to.Also, if you subscribe to consumer reports, you will notice that Sony has the lowest number of repairs followed by Canon in a close second. I have experienced repairs myself as my Kodak DC240 lens got stuck one day and I had to send it in to Eastman Kodak for repair.Also the Sony doesn't have a great big delay when taking each picture, a lot of cameras have this problem. Another thing that bothered me about the other cameras is the time it takes for the camera to be ready to take pictures after you turn it on. Sony cameras tend to be ready fast right after you turn it on, which has helped me capture so many more moments, believe me when I say you'll miss lots of great moments before other cameras turn on.The sony also has a really wonderful movie mode, where the audio is crisp and the movies are clear. My only complaint about the movies are, they don't have image stabilization, so they turn out a little more jiggly than I would like, and for some reason the zoom is disabled when you're in the middle of recording movies. All minor things, but they should be noted.The great thing about 5 megapixels is, you can get your photos blown up to 20X30, and believe me when I say that is really cool. Also, if you were ever to make these pictures your desktop wallpaper, they look good even at 1280 X 1024, which is the highest resolution on a 17\" monitor.Also, I don't know why everyone complains about the included 32MB memory stick. Yes I do understand it is too small to truely use and you have to buy another one, but most digital cameras such as the Canon don't come with any memory at all! The small card that comes with Sony's is to just get you started, and by giving you that they already outdo other manufacturers.Overall, the Sony P10's compact size, wonderful quality pictures, intuitive interface, good price, variety of features and durability make it the perfect choice of digital camera for almost everyone. I cannot recommend this awesome camera enough!", "Date": "December 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "4.5 star: Great! Just a bit slow to capture \"Kodak\" moments", "Author": "Manny Hernandez \"@askmanny\"", "ReviewID": "R3200SG5FGQ2G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For what it offers, this camera is a great deal (both, price and mail-in rebate considered). After shopping around, this was one of the best options we found in the 5MP range. Things we've loved about it:1) Portability (fits in almost any pocket).2) Default picture quality is great (even indoors or by night), plus the max. resolution (2592 x 1944 pixels) allows you to obtain huge enlargements, though the 32MB Memory Stick that comes with it will not fit too many of them.3) It captures video with sound, an upgrade from our previous camera which only shot \"silent\" movies.4) Built-in display has great contrast and picture quality.5) Pictures can be downloaded to PCs or Macs using the traditional USB mode or the faster, more recent USB 2.0 mode which spits them into your computer in a snapshot!The biggest drawbacks I see with the camera are:1) Dependability on propietary technology for storage (Memory Stick) and power (lithium-ion battery).2) Long time it takes to shoot the picture after you press the shutter. This has caused me to loose a few \"Kodak\" moments that just passed \"too fast\" in front of the lens for the camera to react in time to them.All in all, I can live with the cons and highly recommend the camera.

I loved that camera, because it was Sony quality which seems to last forever; I admit I have dropped it several times and it works great. The camera is still running strong as I sold it to a friend, sadly I was slowing becoming unhappy with it because of the lack of zooming features, I knew that I should have bought the one with zoom. Well back in early august I decided on the DSC-P8 as my replacement digi-cam as I from my P3 that Sony cameras last, and it had a 5 mega pixel resolution with zoom, everything I wanted. As I walked into the store to look at the display I felt uneasy about spending the $400 on the camera because it was not as compact as my P3 and I didn't like the look as much as my old one. Then I remembered how I regretted not getting the next model up from my P3 which was why I was in the store looking at Digi-cams again. So I looked up one model then two, and alas I found that I liked the P10 more and could afford to spend the extra $100 for the extra features that were the best at the time, and still are I hope, as so two years down the road I wouldn't be buying another yet. So Far it has been a few months and already I have taking thousands of pictures with amazing quality and I love the camera. So many features and great battery life, not to mention the zoom is so great that I closed in on a plane flying over head that looked no more then a dot in the sky and managed to see the planes markings in the picture on my computer without any enhancing. Great! Not I finally have the camera of my dreams.This is the camera for me, great features and improvements over my P3 and well worth the money. For $100 more I am happier that now I have a super compact, fast and reliable camera that I have already dropped once and it is still fine. When I say compact, it is half an inch smaller then the already small P3. Check it out! It have USB 2.0 which I don't have yet as I need to convince the girlfriend first, and supports up to 1GB which is more then an hour of high quality video as compared to the seconds I got with my P3.BUY ONE!", "Date": "September 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera", "Author": "Sergio Armendariz", "ReviewID": "R387W0HX16PZD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th Sony camera and this is the 5th generation of Sony's DSC's digital cameras (prior main models: DSC 30,50, P5, P7, P8). So this model have evolved with time, refining features, resolution and size, with every model I wished some changes, and for the next model the changes were done, even minute changes... however, it can be overwhelming for a newcomer to check all the 40 or 50 features, variables, settings, modes, screen symbols etc.Regarding general features, you may check Sony's website ([...]) but here is what I personally like and dislike:My favorites:-The all time favorite: You can zoom, trim, copy and save from exisiting pictures, all inside the camera . Say, you want to make a single, separate copy of just one face from a group picture. This is far faster than using the computer.- It has the option to make 3 copies from one single shot...with bracketed exposure (every copy of the picture will come with a different exposure and you keep only the one with the best amount of light). The amount of light between each copy is user defined.- It has an option for a series of 3 pictures with a 0.5 sec. delay between them. This is new in Sony's, a welcomed feature,it's easier to freeze \"the right moment\". It might compensate an existing delay when pressing the shutter, too (if you use it moments before the moment you pretend to capture).-Improved white balance: You con control indoor light color from incandescent, fluorescent etc. with very acceptable results.- It is possible to organize your pictures in different \"folders\", so you can organize them faster once in the computer.- It has several combinations of shutter speed/aperture: small aperture and long shutter (\"fireworks\"), large aperture and fast shutter (\"sports\") etc. etc. ( 7 options); I guess it must compensate the lack of manual controls over aperture/shutter speed.- About the 640X480 movie mode: since this is a series of photos instead of real video, objets in swift movement are blurry, and since not everyone has a steady hand, images usually are a little shaky. In spite of this, this feature was the main reason I purchased this camera, I don't like to use or carry a videocamera, instead I always carry this camera in my pocket and I has been able to capture key moments in the life of my 2 kids, in the most diverse places. Please note this: I takes 128MB to record 6 min. If you buy a mega-hyper-expensive 1GB memory stick you'll get some 45 min. but yo'll be able to record only some 30-35 min. in one standard 800MB compact disk. Remember that you can cut or delete unnecesary portions of movies right in the camera (it splits a movie and you delete the undesired portion).- You can adjust the picture's sharpness, contrast and saturation (besides of exposure adjustment). Adjusted at its maximum setting, a picture of some glorious clouds over a blue sky will be captured very,very close to the real thing.Drawbacks:- Painted, plastic case (DSC-P5 and  P9 were all brushed stainless steel!)- The 6X zoom (3 optical and 3 digital) works only at 3.1MP, not at 5MP (here only takes optical 3X).- I found the font size in messages etc. too little (Am I getting older?).Features I find useless:-There is an histogram, a graph showing the amount of light and shadow on the screen. What is the real and useful purpose of this? Mmmhh..-I've never used the \"sepia\" mode. I guess someone in need of a brown picture, would change the color with software, not with the camera. Who knows?.A note for first timers: Remember that a tiny lens (like the one in this camera) will gather just a small fraction of light compared with larger cameras, so be prepared to get yourself used to the flash when taking pictures at dawn, sunset or indoors...it means a shorter battery life, too. More: In a trip, I used to take some 20 or 30 pictures everyday, and at night I review them in the hotel and kept only the best ones (1 or 3 per day). Just imagine the quality of every picture kept.About the software: Ill-designed. You'll have to get some decent editing software separately. They pretend you should learn to use a non-standard software with limited features...it might be well for someone living in Mars or where fine editing software is non-existing.The bottom line: I have had DSC's cameras over time because they always give you more features for the price...if a small size camera is important to you. Otherwise, there are many other less expensive cameras with many features, but they will be always larger in size, and only if you're lucky you'll have good color reproduction and easy file handling.", "Date": "January 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "For the money: Five Stars", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RTR4GPE4P0F62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a terrific little camera - well-built, easy to use, nice features, compact and classy look.

My first digital camera was a Sony DSC-P30 (1.3 mpx). This camera is the smallest camera out there that offers 5 mpx. I like it because it easily fits into your pocket so you're more prone to take it with you randomly. Sometimes, there are moments you just have to capture on film! There are a lot of accessories that you can purchase (against what someone else said, there is an additional flash add-on, and filters and other things).This camera offers basic features for those \"point and shoot\" people out there. If you have no idea with what to do with ISO settings, exposure, etc... this camera is perfect for you! It has so many preset modes (most of them work well... some have to be retuned). The image quality is about the same with other cameras in the compact range (this camera is sub compact) if you consider the size. Yes, the Canon 5 mpx cameras have better image quality, but they are much bulkier. If you prefer a camera w/ more manual control options, then I'd go with a Canon or Nikon. They seem to have the most features that make the digicam rival high end SLR cameras. If you'd prefer Sony, I would go with the new V1 5 mpx.

The automatic exposure control seems to vary widely from one shot to the next under these conditions, and it's very difficult to get a nighttime picture that isn't blurry.  The only way I've been able to make it behave is to go to manual settings, and even then the pictures aren't as sharp as my old 1.3 Megapixel Olympus in full automatic mode.

On the plus side, the size is great, the movie mode works well, transfers to the computer couldn't be easier, and battery life is reasonably good.

As an owner of a Vaio desktop, a Clie handheld and a Sony Digital HandyCam, it was obvious that when it came time to upgrade to a quality digital still camera, I was going to buy a Sony Cybershot.  So after reviewing the options, which at the time consisted only of the P10, the V1 and the then-new U series of super compacts, I chose this model in the spring of 2004.  Initially, my experience was good.  I was upgrading from the 1MP camera that was part of my Sony Digital HandyCam so the image quality to me was astounding.  Other advantages were:- Easy point & shoot right out of the box...it did not require my wife to read the manual in order to begin taking stills.- Unlike my previous digital still experiences, this camera performs well in low-light situations.  The integrated flash is capable of lighting small rooms.- Battery capacity is ample and the features, although some difficult to use, are comprehensive.  Disadvantages:- STARTUP TIME...don't expect this camera to be able to power-up and take a candid shot within 8-10 seconds.  By the time you get this puppy ready to fire, the moment is gone.- The menu tree is cumbersome and not altogether intuitive.  Changing advanced settings is difficult unless all you want to do is switch modes (Program AE, etc.)- As with most still cameras (Sony & the like), the included MemoryStick is way too small.  So the purchase of an additional MS is obligatory.My biggest beef with this camera, and the reason it earns only two stars is that it seems FRAGILE.  After only 5-6 months of use, it began to occasionally have startup/shutdown problems.  By the end of 2004 (~9 months of use) the auto focus was beginning to fail on a regular basis.  Now, outside the 6-month warranty window, I am forced to pay $200 to $300 for LABOR ALONE to have the camera fixed, parts still covered under the original warranty.  But still, this is a cost prohibitive solution.So now I am at the crossroads with my Sony products.  My PDA is approaching the end of its useful life and I find myself without a digital still camera that is capable of taking any pictures in focus -- remember the cyber-shots do not provide for manual focus.  Perhaps it is time to consider a Canon product or other comparible vendor?", "Date": "January 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but recommend Canon S400 instead", "Author": "tmchow", "ReviewID": "R1N8BRNVSXR9HV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought the S400 from Dell for $xxx a little while back and was considering the Sony DSC-P10 at the time as well.  I figured I'd write up a review on amazon to help other people out that are in the decision making process.  **I posted a similar writeup for the Canon S400 about 10 mins ago, and also provide recommendations in that review of what accessories to buy for that camera if you decide to go with it.**  Price:-----The Sony DSC-P10 is 5 MP vs. 4 MP for the S400.  The difference in resolution may immediately sway your decision to teh DSC-P10, but I would think very carefully. While the extra 1 MP sounds like a lot, my old 2.0 MP Canon S00 was fine for priting pictures all the way up to 8x10 (w/o any cropping). 4 MP resolution should allow you to price 11x14 with no cropping, and 8x10 with a lot of cropping.  5 MP is just excessive IMO. These days, it's just a race among manufacturers to see who can advertise the highest MP number.Shooting modes and menus---------------------------------P10 also has some convenient shooting modes which make it more user friendly.  It also has great features like cropping, resizing and rotating right on the camera which helps when you are not by a computer and want to free up room on your media storage.  P10 Also has a smartzoom feature which is neat in theory, but as all users of digicams know, you should never use digital zoom of any kind. Turn it off and stick to optical zoom. You can always do the equivalent of \"digital zoom\" on your computer later with any photo editing software, even MS Paint!The flash on the P10 is more offset from the lens than the S400, which will cause shadows to be cast on subjects when you take pictures. Imagine someone shining a flashlight on someone's face from an angle you you taking a picture. You'll see shadows on one side of the person's head. While it is not severe, it is worth noting that this effect is not as noticeable on the S400 (the flash is closer to the lens).S400 has 9 point autofocus system, while P10 has 3 point.  It means that the S400 can choose from 9 points to autofocus from in the current settings you are taking a picture of.  In the end, this means that the canon has better of of chosing the right thing to focus in on which will mean better pictures.  Imagine having 3 oranges and 1 is rotten. You have a 1/3 chance of picking the rotten one. Now imagine you have 9 oranges with 1 rotten one -- you only have a 1/9 chance.  This analogy isn't perfect, but you get my point :)The Canon S400 has a far superior menu system and is much easier to use.  Size:-----Canon S400 is smaller, making it a more pocketable camera IMO. The specs shown them being only very slightly different in dimensions, but the total volume of the cameras makes the S400 ideal.  Those with bigger hands may prefer the layout and slightly larger size of the P10 though.Memory storage:---------------The P10 uses Memory cards, which are limited to 128 MB, unless you use the double sided ones (Sony Memory Duo), where you can flip them over to get another 128 MB. Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it. My friend who bought the P10 surely does.  You can get larger memory sticks, which comes in the form of the \"Sony Memory Pro\", which are 256 MB and 512 MB.  Keep in mind though, that these cards have problems acting as regular storage for files, and things like Mp3s for sony mp3 players. They have some type of digital rights management (DRM) on them that have causes lots of problems for people (so i've read on many reviews).  Also, these PRO cards only work in 2003 (or newer) sony devices.  Lastly, the memory pro cards have some type of management files on the cards themselves, taking up about 20MB of space. So a 256 MB card, really only has about 230 MB.  Maybe not a big deal, but com'on, at advertise the size correctly!Battery Life:-------------Battery life on P10 is better than the S400. It will last about 20% longer.  However, the batteries are cheaper for the S400 AFAIK and they also charge in about 1/2 the time vs. the sony batteries.Conclusion:-----------All in all, i think the S400 is a better choice. Sure, CF maybe outdated in a few years in favor of smaller, superior storage media like SD, MMC or xD cards (which are going up to 1 GB btw), but until then you can get a great digicam with dirt cheap media. I picked up a 512 MB Kingston card for very cheap from eBay.  Memory sticks are IMO, completely limited in storage and future expandability. The fact that sony has shunned all pe-2003 devices from using larger than 128 memory duo cards, indicates that users of the P10 can expect similar treatment going forward.

Hope this review answers all those inconsistencies.Fact 1: The camera does not support black and white pictures.  HOWEVER, it supports Sephia, which is just like black and white, except instead of shades of grey, its in shades of tan color.  Maybe this was added in instead of B&W; because Sephia seems to look better than B&W.;  In any case any picture in Sephia can be converted by paint software to b&w; (but you can convert color pictures to B&W; using paint software too)Fact 2: Blurry images can be eliminated by choosing the correct options.  It is eliminated completely if you force the flash to happen (via option) during each picture.  The flash brightness is adjustible.  Blurry images happen only if the scene is bright enough and the default options automatically turns off the flash, and you can't keep the image steady.  The only problem comes is when you wish to take pictures of places that are not too bright and the objects are too far away for the flash to brighten.  In this case, forcing the flash to happen will remove any blurry images, but the long distant objects will be dark.  For this special case, you need a steady hand or a tripod.  Why do blurry images happen?  Because the aperature is left open longer to gather more light for the scene.  (Otherwise it becomes too dark in the picture).  Any movement during the time it is open will end up being blurry.  If you leave the flash on, the camera always assumes there will be enough light, so it always closes the shutter fast, removing blurry images.Fact 3: Cool accessory to have for this camera is the 2.6X telephoto lens VCL-DH2630 (requires another separate adapter body VAD-PHA as well).  It increases the total optical zoom to 7.8 times, which you will not regret having if you are taking scenic pictures.Fact 4: The camera can take 22 minutes 37 second movies with the included 32Meg memory stick if you choose the 160 pixels wide movies.  And with the default 32 megabyte memory stick, you can only take 1 minute 27 seconds of 640 pixels wide movies.  Increase the stick size, you and increase the length of movies proportionally.  So with 2 Gig mem stick, you get more than 24 hours of 160 pixel wide movies, and 1 and a half hour 640 pixels wide movies (length of most theatre movies).  And they all include sound!Fact 5: The camera has a deep list of features.  Most of the people who use it will use the default automatic mode.  There are two other modes (scenic, and programmable) you turn with the dial.  It is in these other modes that you can get special features or tune your picture capturing options.  The only thing you can't manually adjust is the focus, but the camera comes with many different auto-focus settings and predefined focus increments.Fact 6: The camera takes pretty good pictures.

In fact, they are so close I had to print out both feature lists to find the three small details that are different. One difference is the battery: the P10 has an InfoLithium NP-FC11, and the P92 has NiMH AA batteries.  The InfoLithium is square, sealed and compact compared to the AA batteries in the P92. Both are rechargeable and the charger comes in the box, but the AA batteries in the P92 must come out of the camera to be recharged, whereas the P10 just plugs into the wall (a nice feature.)The P92 is (a hardly-noticeable) two-ounces heavier than the 7.5-ounce P10.  This probably comes from heavier batteries and larger case.  The case on the P92 is slightly larger, and to my judgment, a bit more bulky feeling than the P10. I REALLY like the way the P10 feels in my hand.  I had a Fuji digital camera that took GREAT pictures and had a quick shutter speed, but it was bulky and felt cheap.  The P10 feels solid.  Even when the lens is fully extracted, it too feels solid.The other difference is in the available Scene Modes: P10 has seven (Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Fast Shutter) and the P92 has five (Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Beach, Snow)The buttons feel like they will last the life of the camera and are labeled and quite easy to use.  Just from the labels/icons next to the buttons I was able to fool around with the camera for awhile before I had to consult the owner's manual.Speaking of the owner's manual... this camera has a deep list of features, and when you break down the how-to of each feature it can make the manual a bit lengthy.  But, it's worth it in the end.  You will be taking better pictures because you will be using more of the features that are designed to make your picture taking easier and better.  So far, my favorite feature is the Snow Scene Mode. I took some pictures in the snow at the normal setting and later took some in the Snow Mode.  After downloading them I noticed a big difference; the pictures (in Snow Mode) looked exactly the way it did to my naked eye.Cons:- My Fuji digital took better low-light pictures than this one.  The flash on the P10 has three settings (Low, Normal and High), but it still seems to overpower some settings where you would like to catch the ambient lighting. I think this is simply an operator error and me not reading even deeper into the manual. But the Fuji low-light pix looked better with less button pushing and feature fumbling.- The shutter is a bit slower than other digital cameras, but that is due to the 5 megapixels it is trying to gather.  I bought a SanDisk 256MB MagicGate MemoryStick Pro because I was told that it took faster pictures and shortened your downloading time versus a regular issue MemoryStick. You can also use the Fast Shutter Scene Mode (better used outdoors) to help you out with the slow shutter.Favorite features:- Display is bright and can even be seen outside.- Your most often used features are just a button away.- Size and feel. Just slightly longer than a deck of cards.- You can alter (i.e. Solarize, Sepia, Negative Art) and edit pictures right on the camera.-  You can take movies with sound!

The only problem we had was the standard memory card given was way to small. We can take only about 30 shot each time. Then after a month the picture turn blurry and fuzzy sometimes. So far we took only 250 pictures with it.Then last month the flash gave up on us. We read the manual and tried to fix the problem but nothing help. We call the SONY help line and they can't solved the problem either. If we want to get it repair we have to send it all the way to TEXAS as they don't have any customer service or repair technician here in LA or California. And it will cost us $171.00 excluding S/H for the workmanship. What made me mad was I paid $420.00 for this camera and it is not cheap. I expected much more from this camera for the amount I paid. If the camera cost only $200.00 I won't be so heart sick about it.We decided not to repair it because with the cost of the repair we can buy a BRAND NEW CAMERA that works much better than a \"SONY'.

It is easy to use and it takes great pictures on the day time. At night it is always hard to take sharp pictures though, a lot of my pictures are blurry, especially when you do a full optical zoom. I am not sure if it is a problem across all digital camera though. The picture colors are not as bright as some other cameras but it seems to be more \"realistic\" photos (ie not articially brightness enhanced). I would have preferred to get DSC-V1 though, because of so many enhancements as well as Carl-Zeiss lens but at the time of purchase the price of DSC-V1 is out of my league.Here are some of the things that annoys me:- Does not have 2Megapixel settings. Sure, why do u want 2Megapixel pictures when there is 5Mp and 3.2Mp available? But have u ever try to load up 3.2 or 5 Mp pictures (about 1.2 - 3 Mb in size) to the internet, if you only have dialup modem available? Also, you really do not want to put such big pictures on the net anyway. 2Mp pictures are sized around 300 - 400k which is reasonable.- Only silver color camera available in USA (Asian countries and Australia sells red/blue colors as well).- 32Mb memory sticks included: I mean come on, that is so small! I thought it is a joke that Sony gives such small memory sticks. I never used it because it would too easily be filled up after taking a few shots. I probably will use it for backing up of my Sony Clie instead. Sony should give out 128Mb memory sticks instead, especially it is so much cheaper these days.My recommendations are:- Get a spare battery, especially when you travel overseas. Even though I sometimes managed to use only 1 battery per day, when u go somewhere u just point and shoot and do not think about battery life, so it is simply better to get a spare. if you can afford to fork out so much for this camera I cannot see why you cannot get a spare battery as well.- Get large size memory sticks (like 256Mb or more), especially when u are taking high resolution pictures. I personally have multiple 128Mb memory sticks. By the way, get the Sony tripod as well. It is small, portable and reasonable price.

Aflleje", "ReviewID": "RHS59SEQ7CJ6K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As an owner of the 2 megapixel Sony DSC-S50 I was a little disappointed with the DSC-P10.  First of all it's missing the ability to shoot B&W; photos.  Although you can edit your photos with basic photo software later, you no longer have the ability to view and shoot B&W; photos.  Another feature greatly missed is the 2\" swivel LCD display.  This allowed you to hold your camera over your head, out over a ledge or lower than eye level without you having to get in those positions to take a picture.  Most disappointing, though is the slow response time.  Being new to the 5 megapixel realm, this may be common.  But taking one picture to the next, especially when using a flash, can take up to 7 seconds.  A cool new feature is Burst mode, which allows you to take 3 photos in a little over a second.  But again going from one set of three to the next takes a whopping 9 seconds.Now for the good stuff.  Being an \"advanced\" point-and-shoot user, I like the ease of use along with the more advanced controls the DSC-P10 gives you in taking photos.  I'm learning how to use the histogram to get desired lighting effects.  The menus are fairly easy to learn and navigate and the compact size makes it easy to carry.  The Burst mode, mentioned earlier, is a cool feature.  And, as was with the case of the DSC-S50, I'm very satisfied with the sharp picture quality.  A great improvement in the Movie mode is the 640 x 480 resolution and no longer being limited to 15 seconds worth of video.  Now your only limitation is the size of your memory stick.One recommendation if you decide on this camera, get a spare battery or the starter kit that includes the spare battery.  The battery life on this camera is about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Not long enough for an event or a day out on vacation.  Also get at least a 128 MB memory stick.  The 32 MB stick that comes with the camera only gives you 24 pictures in the 5 megapixel mode.

Compare a Sony picture with an Olympus, Minolta, or Canon, even with a lower amount of Megapixels the quality will beat sony at the highest setting.

Yesterday I tried to catch some candid moment about my daughter's basketball practice.  I caught the shoots but the focused object was not in the center of the picture .

I just rated it a 1 for the article because I am focusing on what I didn't like).One of the most annoying features (and technically embarrassing for Sony) is that the internal viewfinder and LED do NOT crop the photo the same way.  As an example, take a picture of a horizontal line on a wall, and position the camera so that the line is at the top edge of the photo.  If you use the LED on the back of the camera, the line in the photo will appear about where it should be.  However if you take the same picture using the internal viewfinder, the photo will show the line about 15-20% of the way below the top edge of the photo.  Therefore, on bright days when you have to use the internal viewfinder, whatever you shoot photos of appear much lower in the photo than how you actually cropped it.  It is very annoying as you try to compensate by guessing.  This is very sloppy engineering.  Other annoying features include:The wide angle/telephoto control makes exaggerated adjustments that make fine adjustment difficult.  This is very annoying when trying to make fine cropping adjustments.You cannot delete photos off the stick using Windows Explorer.  If you want to delete all the photos off the stick, you have to drill down several levels into the camera menu.To turn on \"Red Eye Reduction\", you have to turn off the camera mode, and go several levels into the menu mode.  This is very annoying when you have people waiting to take their picture.  There should be a direct access button to this common feature.There is little photo quality consistency.  While some outdoor photos look fantastic, seemingly similar conditions produce washed out photos.Why am I keeping it?  You still have to love all the features that they DO pack into something this small. You gotta love the size!!!", "Date": "December 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Shutter delay makes this camera unusable.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3QHIP8W0HRM24", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera yesterday and began trying it out.  I tried to take pictures of my cat and my daughter under medium light conditions (indoors at night, but well lit).  The shutter delay made taking pictures impossible.  I depressed the shutter half way and waited, but my cat ran out of the room (frightened by the bright orange autofocus helper light) before the camera could get ready to take the picture and my 3 year old looked away.  The average shutter delay for these conditions was around 3sec(which is completely unacceptable).  The autofocus has such a hard time with lighting that half of the pictures turned out blurry.  I would not recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take candid pictures of real subjects.  It's almost impossible even using burst mode to capture those \"once in a lifetime\" shots.  Also when I called SONY tech support for help I wasted a bunch of time with an automated system and finally got to a guy with a thick accent that was difficult to understand.  He basically read page 21 out of the manual to me.  What a joke!This could be a good camera if the shutter delay was shorter.  On still life objects the camera gave impressive results and great special effects - like the sepia mode.

It just sticks out from the camera, open to any insult, however minor it might seem.  Other sony cameras have a metal frame around the LCD (think of it as a picture in a frame, vs a picture in glass without a frame).
