{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A much needed improvement of the coolpix range", "Author": "Jared", "ReviewID": "RPSI80O40JK26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found the last generation of coolpix cameras to be disappointing at best. This one however has received some massive improvements.1. It's very very fastIt is speedy in all ways possible. The shutter response time in almost instantaneous. As soon as you click the button the photo takes... give 1 additional second in poor lighting at worst. Best of all is the photo navigation. Remember those old coolpix commercials where Ashton Kutcher would flick his finger and all the photos would scroll by fast? That never worked before, but it actually does on this one. There is no lag whatsoever on photo viewing or changing settings.2. Excellent photo qualityI was playing with this in best buy and it took very noticeably clearer photos than the other camera in the same price range... including the Canon powershots. Its actually what made me decide to buy one before I learned all the other good stuff.3. FunctionalityIt doesn't allow manual exposure and aperture controls because of its size. However they give you a ton of different scene modes to play around with. Some are a little too niche to matter, but all the main ones are there. Also you can do lots of adjustments to a photo that has already been taken. These are made even easier by using the little included stylus which hangs off your camera strap. The camera has a very good feature which allows you to choose the focus of your picture simply by tapping it on the screen. Finally a purpose to using a touch screen besides flashiness.4. LooksIts slim and the screen is large and clear. It's very minimalistic with only 2 buttons on the back. The camera looks very traditional and minimalistic, like most of the coolpix range. It doesn't look or feel cheap by all means, but you're not gonna turn heads when you use it... unless of course you're caught scrolling your library (which does feel pretty cool).The Bad PartsThis camera only has a couple of negative issues. First off, the lens does not retract into the body when you're viewing photos. It means you can switch to shooting really fast, but it also burdens the way in which you can hold your camera. I would have liked to have been able to hold it flat in my palm while looking at my photos. Another problem is that it doesn't use a battery charger, it charges with a usb cable that plugs directly into the camera. It comes with an AC power adapter that you can plug the cable into if you want... kind of like what an ipod uses. I guess it makes everything simpler and you can carry less stuff when you travel, but I like to charge extra batteries while I'm using my camera.The touchscreen has a slightly matte surface. Which means it gets very dirty very fast. I put a surface shield on this immediately and it has eliminated that problem completely... but it also makes the touch controls slightly less responsive. If you do this, you can still control the camera well with your finger, but it's faster and easier to navigate photos with the stylus.I HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone needing a good point and shoot, especially if speed is important to you.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, stylish, easy to use and excellent pictures", "Author": "Surgery100 \"ADJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1RQ4MWPLU5FDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary: A great everyday camera.

Sherman", "ReviewID": "R1HXW0NHESWPQZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's interesting how Amazon has divided up the reviews for the Coolpix S4000 based on the color of the camera (at least as of this writing). Moving on: This is a nice little camera, it's the third in my collection of compacts, the only one with a touch screen. I have posted photos taken with it, both post-processed and straight out of the camera. My notes:There is an issue with charging the battery. This has been mentioned in at least one other review, don't remember the color of that camera (doesn't matter). Recharging is not done as described in the quick start guide. Put the USB connector in the wall plug-in part, and plug it into your outlet, THEN attach the other end to the camera. This is the only way that the camera will be triggered to turn on and recharge. Wall first, camera second.The guide says charging a fully discharged battery can take up to two hours and 10 minutes, or thereabouts. After three and a half hours, though the light was still blinking, I unplugged mine during its first charge. The battery icon did not show up in the display, meaning it was charged.The default should not be for digital zoom to be turned on. Make your first menu adjustment turning that off!Another reviewer got the best results with a setting of 3m for the images. I set mine at 8 and they seem fine; unless you are going to print very large posters, you also may want to cut back from the 12m.Flash settings aren't sticky, so if you turned it off and then turned the camera off, the flash will be back on auto when you turn it back on.I found the color to be good, white balance to be fairly accurate, exposure to be so-so, all in auto scene mode. The touch screen works well but it does pick up fingerprints--scrolling and selecting worked better for me using my fingernail; they provide a stylus that can be attached to the strap and would also help reduce greasiness on the screen.The red version looks just plain cool. It's very small, even for a compact, and very lightweight. It's a camera for snapshots, and with that limitation in mind, I think it does very well. (Don't over-expect.) I noticed that it sometimes found more than one focus spot in a scene, and that worked well. Mine came with a carrying case included in the box. It comes with the full manual on a CD. The card readers built into both my laptop and desktop computers (both Windows 7, a Dell and an HP) were able to read the card with no problem, so I did not install any of the software that came with it.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S4000 12MP", "Author": "Ronald R. Riesbeck \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R1HNX8WSRRC9Y9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera on a Nikon promotion for Mothers Day.  It included a case and a Sand Dish 2g card.  I would like to tell you of some issues I had with this camera and have since cleared it up with a call to Nikon.Charging the battery:First, is how to charge the battery.  You must plug the a/c charger into a electrical outlet.....THEN.....plug the adapter into the charge port of the camera.  If you try it any other way, it won't charge.  The quick start, manual on CD and the downloadable manual from Nikon............spell it out the wrong way.Firmware update:My camera came with version 1.0.  If you go to [...]  you will find a new version is waiting for you to download.  They also have an illustrated file to download to help you do the update.  The SD card is formatted by the camera........... .......a PC will not read the card.  My XP pro did not read the card.  Therefore, you cannot copy the firmware to the SD disk.  My Windows 7 machine did read it, copied it and I made an update to my camera.  So your XP machine might not be able to do the update.Another issue is how to power the camera during the update.  The instructions were not clear to me and a call to Nikon approves of this approach.  Use a fully charged battery as the only power source and you will be able to complete the update.The update will change the HD video from 24 to 30fps.If you buy a SD card...check with the 200 page manual to see what cards are approved.  Write times vary with manufacture.  The Sand Disk, I felt, had a rapid write time.I am pleased with the camera.  It is packed with features that Amazon points out during camera description.  It should be noted that in AUTO, the camera picks out what it likes to make your shot.  AUTO is a place to START making your perfect photo.  The camera has many features to fine tune that shot into a family treasure.  Spend some time and try ALL the features and see what happens to the same photo shot.  Its part of the fun of digital cameras.  I don't mind saying, I resisted digital and stayed with film for many years.  This camera will allow you to be creative in a much faster pace.  Is it going to replace a 650$ SLR.  No way.  It will allow you to carry a very cool pocket camera to get those \"grab me shots\" or just really get into digital photography.Nikon can be reached at 1 800 645 6689  7days a week from 8am to 2am Eastern time.  They were very patient and helpful to me during my two calls to them.  Also try their web site for answers on consumer questions on this camera.  There was an answer on XP problems during transfer from camera to pc.

This camera's touchscreen interface was great. I really enjoyed the options available along with having the ability to press a button for preview and some settings (not 100% touchscreen), but was disappointed with the quality of the photos and video. The video was nowhere near HD. I played with the settings and used it outside with plenty of light and it was choppy and noisy. I installed the included photo software and that just made it play without breaking up every second, but it was still not HD. I took some photos in low light indoors and played with the ISO settings along with the auto setting and none of them proved to be adequate. You get fuzzy photos without the flash too. In good lighting I found the photos to be too soft around the edges of faces and routinely took blurry pics too. I had to try a couple times just to get a solid photo of my toddler...not enough of a stabilizing feature for me.I returned it with regret and am looking into Canon compact digital cameras because the Canon Powershot SX20IS that we have now we are very happy with.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "T.

Baecker", "ReviewID": "RGJ2GDJBTL9G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I was first scouring the net for reviews on this baby, I kept coming across \"image resolution not as good as advertised\" and \"deleting photos is such a pain\" but personally, I found the resolution of this camera absolutely amazing. While I do agree that it does take a while to delete individual photos, it's actually not so bad when you're deleting photos en masse. (A lot of people complained of the absence of that particular feature, but in reality you just zoom out while flipping through photos, hit the little garbage bin, just tap each photo you want to delete, and hit OK.) The flash is surprisingly pretty good, though you have to hold down the shutter button for like, two whole seconds, and it's crazy bright, but it's tolerable. And I love the flash-only-to-reduce-red-eye option! The start up and shut down is nice and quick, too. I like how slim and small it is, makes it easier to just shove in my skinny jeans pocket or into a small handbag. The touch-screen is also pretty magnificent, and it's actually really sensitive to touch; there's an option to take a photo just by tapping the screen, and all I did was graze my fingertip on the screen and it took the photo! (The camera comes with a stylus, in case you're like me: paranoid about getting icky finger prints and such on your screen.) Editing isn't great, but the quality makes up for it. And what made this even better was the very reliable shipping. Overall, I definitely recommend this camera.

The only option for Image Review is On or Off.  I primarily take pictures of my young children, so I need the instant image review after taking a picture so that I can make sure I got the shot.  However the image review time is between 5-7 seconds and there's no option to reduce that time.  My previous Kodak would clear the image review when I pressed the shutter button, but this one doesn't have that feature or any other way to clear the image review early. Turning off the image review just doesn't work for me since I then would have to hope I got the picture or go into the image review and check the shot.  It's also possible that it just takes too long to store the image, though this doesn't seem to be the case when I turn off image review.  Nikon tech support wasn't very helpful.  They said that maybe a faster data card would help (I have a class 2 I believe though they weren't even able to help me confirm the class.)The size of the camera is great and picture quality seems good and the price is good.

But after a few weeks and months with the camera, the love affair comes to a screeching halt.When taking pictures one after another the camera is very slow. You wait a good 3-4 seconds before a second picture can be taken.The touch screen is a great tool but is somewhat unresponsive. This definitely is not your \"iPhone\" multi-touch glass. The screen has a somewhat rough texture and gets fingerprints way too easy. It kind of reminds me of a credit card reader at the super market. Sometimes you have to tap multiple times to get it to recognize your input.Lastly, The SD card goes in smooth but doesn't \"spring\" out very well. Even after you push down to release the spring on the SD card it doesn't come out without some prying.iPhoto USERS!!! Beware! This camera will not automatically orient your pictures to \"portrait\" if you take a picture with the camera sideways...

Madsen \"jcmadsen\"", "ReviewID": "R1JN4HTW8EOO4I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the S4000 after reading the extensive reviews.  It really came down to the Nikon or the Canon S1400.  The Canon was almost too small, so I decided on the Nikon.  I already had 2 other digital cameras, both Canon, but needed one that could easily slip into my pocket.  The purchase coincided with our family trip to Disney World, where I took approximately 1000 photos.First, the good - the size, feel, battery life and 3 inch touchscreen are all definite pluses. Easy to use on automode.  I've had no problems with charging the camera and getting a full day of photos.However, I have to concur with many of the negative aspects I've read about the camera from other owners/reviewers.  Most frustrating was speed.  When you take a snapshot, you really can't take another for almost 5 seconds.  This is especially annoying when your trying to capture a photo of, say, your child with Mickey Mouse!  You take a pic, and have to give the \"one more, just a second, don't move!\" line as people are waiting behind you.  When outdoors, I finally switched to \"sport\" mode, and just held the button down.  That allowed me to get a picture about every 1-2 seconds.  No waiting that way.The photos I took outdoors came out great!  No problem with them.  But, inside?  Well, not so great.  I'll admit, I could probably stand to read up on what setting is best for indoor pics.  But, most point and shoot cameras on automode will adjust for this.  I won't say the pics were a disaster; but, they certainly could be better.As far as video, it really didn't work.  I had two occasions where I was shooting in video mode, indoors, and both times the camera just stopped.  Again, before I say that the video doesn't work at all, I need to do some more experimenting.  I will say I've never had a problem shooting video with my Canons.  But, neither have 720p HD capability.  Perhaps the SD card needs formatting?  I don't know.  I'd like to see if others have issues with the video as I did.As I point out in the title of the review, you pretty much get what you pay for.  At $110, it's a very good price.  The size is great when you don't want to haul around a larger camera, strapped to your shoulder, for 12 hours as you walk all over the Magic Kingdom.  The screen is great, and overall, the pictures are decent.  If you're looking for an economical camera that you can slide into your front pocket, and aren't overly worried about speed of taking multiple picutres, the S4000 can do the trick.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not happy with lack of sharpness", "Author": "MuseumBooks", "ReviewID": "R1Z0KADWFISYBO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a street photographer who usually uses an slr but always carries a pocket camera for grab and go shots.

I carried an Olympus weatherproof pocket camera for 5 years with good results and thought it was time to upgrade.  The wider zoom range is a cool feature but not at the expsense of sharpness.

This camera does have a 16-shot continuous function but this is not what I need.After my first two Nikons I purchased a Canon and an Olympus. Neither suffered from this limitation. With both of those I could pint, shoot, point, shoot, over and over. The Canon allowed me to select a zero to three second period for each image to be displayed after frame capture. This worked well for my needs. The reason I have gone back to Nikon is that my previous Nikons had noticeably better image quality than the Canon and somewhat better than the Olympus.Unfortunately the Nikon COOLPIX s4000 picture quality is poor.

The camera feature is excellent.  Great sound...amazing clear videos.7. slim, lightweight design.  You could put it in your pocket if you wanted.8. when playing video back, the camera actually has speakers to hear it.  My old camera didn't which was annoying.9. you can touch the screen to tell the camera what part of the picture to focus on.What I don't like:1. Touch screen can be a little frustrating.  If you're used to the touch screens on smartphones or ipods, this one isn't as seamless.  You have to press harder and sometimes a few times before it processes that you've made a selection.2. speed.  In most settings, the camera takes what feels like too long to allow for another picture.  So when taking action pictures, or trying to get that blurry baby picture to be clear, you want to take several pictures rapidly....the only way to do this is to do the multi image, but then you ahve to edit those out seperately.  It's just kind of annoying.3. Reds don't seem QUITE as brilliant as they should be.4. blink feature.  Doesn't work as it should....seems kind of pointless to me.5. different colors cost different amounts?  not a big deal but I got the plum one because it was cheapest.Overall...if I had to purchase a camera again right now, I'd very likely pick this one again.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's good", "Author": "Jejelinda", "ReviewID": "R19AD03GZMOFBL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's good.

Someone took the first one out of my person and I bought another one just like it because I had invested so much time learning how to work it. I assumed all digital cameras were difficult to use. Now I wish I would have bought a Sony.The pictures are decent, but the camera is not intuitive. If I want anything other than a regular shot I have to spend several minutes pushing buttons and it is usually a matter of luck if I get to where I want. I just randomly move about until I see something that might work. It you want an easy, intuitive camera, got for a Sony Cyber-shot.One of the nice features about this camera is that it has the feature that I call \"beauty\" - it softens and edits blotch blemishes on faces. It lets you do it subtly or intensely. My daughter doesn't like this feature because she says it makes peoples' faces look fat. Another nice feature is that the camera picks up people's faces and automatically focuses on them.I'm sure this would be a wonderful camera, and has lots of great options like self-timer, fireworks, low light, beach light, indoors, mountain scenes, flowers, etc, but I can't ever figure out how to get to them at the moment I need those things.

Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I want a camera I can just set to auto mode and not have to worry about fussing with settings for different pictures.  So I took this out of the box and started shooting.  I just downloaded the pictures for the first time...and they are very blurry.  I thought no worries, I'll take care of this in editing.  Well, I couldn't figure out how to edit, I called Nikon and they informed me that I have to purchase NX2 editing software separate from the camera to get red eye, crop, and auto adjust editing.  The cost of the software is $180!!!  That's the price I paid for the camera!  Are they serious?  For someone who is in the $200 market, I will find another camera for $200 that includes the editing software.  Good grief!  They did inform me that the camera has red eye settings, etc. that I can adjust up front.  But again...I want a camera I can set to auto and not worry about settings.  I am most concerned that the quality came out very poor.  We had purchased a Canon 3100IS prior to this, the picture quality was great and the editing software came with it included in price of camera...we returned it only because it seemed slow to take pictures.  This Nikon isn't really much of an improvement as far as response time...and given the quality and editing issues, we will be returning this and probably re-purchasing the Canon.

Fuji FinePix F300EXR and Nikon Coolpix 8100.I read a lot reviews and specs. Made online searches. It seems these two have both cons and pros. Could not decide.I went to best buy to touch and benchmark these. Still could not decide.Then, I found, [\u2026] vs-Nikon_Coolpix_S8100Was I lucky or what? Beautiful. They just did it for me. (I did not thank the reviewer though)So, I decided to buy a Nikon S8100, It seems, I did the right choice, as I always do (not humble? may be).I have been using Nikon S8100 for several days. Very likable camera. Easy to handle. High def LCD is fancy. Nice dial and lots of functions. (You gotta read the manual for them). If you are lazy, then use auto function. For many cases, you will get good quality pictures. However, you might need to adjust your shooting conditions, if the scene is not suitable for auto mode.From previous feedbacks, several of them are poorly said and concluded. It seems they did not even the the manual. This camera has a lot of options (I mean a lot) and manual is 220 pages. So, read it. (It takes 2.5 hours to finish). Then you will have some idea how to shoot.Now,1. Feedback regarding \"Poor low light condition\", I took several pics in low light with auto mode and manual mode. They are both fine. Image stabilization helps a lot. So, read the manual. It tells how to shoot in low light.2. Feedback regarding \"Continuous zoom noise in video mode\", If you set your AF focus single mode rather than AF continuous, then it goes away. It is in the manual.3. Feedback regarding \"battery\", I took ~250 pics, It is still going. Manual says, once you first got the battery, charge it for 3.5 hours. That's what I did. I did not record long run movie though. This might be the case for video mode in high def mode.4. There is multi-function menu dial. I love it.5. You gotta get a additional memory card (I got 8 GB, it seems more than enough). Internal one is nothing.6. You can charge the camera via your computers USB. Love it.7. If you buy a leather carrying case for Nikon S series cameras, it does not fit.

Added expense ???.The Nikon consumer rep said they were saving me money by no longer supplying a printed manual with their cameras. Really? The manuals are printed in China on paper that is just a notch above bathroom tissue, so the cost of printing 200 pages, is what, 25 to 50 cents.  I'd be quite happy to fork over another dollar or two for a written manual that I could take along on trips.Nikon does include a 20 page QUICK START guide, which consistently refers to a page in the CD manual for more detailed information.
