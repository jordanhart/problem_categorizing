The first time I took it out it leaked and destroyed my camera. Thankfully I had insurance and was able to replace it. I was super worried taking it out again. I followed the directions step by step and tested it several times before trying again. I took it out and watched it carefully for signs of leakage and sure enough it leaked again. I got it out of the water before it could do anymore damage. Terrible product, just buy a camera that's made to go underwater because this case is super high maintenance  and doesn't even work.

I haven't tested it out yet but it coming from Sony, I have no doubts of its reliability. It seems to be built very sturdy and comes with a set of dessicant packets which is a plus! I use it with my Sony Cybershot DSC-T110... It comes with 3 different adapters to fit other cybershot cameras. The adapter that works with my camera doesn't allow you to use every function of the camera (like if I want to switch modes I have to change it before placing it into the device). I can't even access the zoom in/out outside of the device which is a big bummer but I'll get over it. Overall, great product.

So before our trip to Kauai we decided to do some research on water cameras. We already have the Sony DSC-TX7 so we also researched this case and decided after many good reviews to purchase.I made sure to read the manual from beginning to end since I read that some people didn't do as such and did not get good results. I did exactly as the manual suggests and had absolutely no problems with my camera getting wet and the picture/video quality is awesome. The sound on video isn't that great but then again your camera is inside the case. Also to mention, if there are water drops on the lens then you will get water drops in your pic. This is the only issue...but not really much of an issue. We have absolutely no regrets. Also make sure to soak it in fresh water after using in salt. I dried it off and took out my camera, then closed it back and soaked it.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product for the buck!", "Author": "Iva", "ReviewID": "R3R8GUO2TPHVC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've researched underwater cameras and marine packs for months!I'm a scuba diver so I wanted a good product,that's going to last me years,without paying a thousand dollars!I'm extremely happy with my choice-the Sony MPKTHJ DSC and the Sony TX-9:) I first bought the sony TX-10 to put in this pack,but as other reviews pointed out-they don't work together!
