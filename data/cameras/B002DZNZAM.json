{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great Buy!", "Author": "Alan B. Richards", "ReviewID": "R3KKTA6JN7LRYA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, this camera is a great buy! But it would not be such a good choice in the $90 dollar price range. It does snapshots very well but the quality of the photo goes down with zoomed or low light shots. It uses 3 triple-A batteries, readily available just about anywhere. A real plus in my book. A replacement battery pack for my SLR is more expensive than this whole camera!I purchased this from a local retailer on a Christmas sale for even less than Amazon's price. I had been looking for a more portable camera for snapshots as my SLR is a bit much a lot of the time. But was not willing to pay $100 - $200 for a snapshot camera. 5 megapixels is the minimum resolution anyone should ever accept from any digital camera. And this fills the bill nicely. Small, convenient, easy to just slip into the pocket. And cheap enough to not have a heart attack over if it were to get damaged. This is the digital equivalent of the old Kodak Instamatic with slightly better pictures. Almost a throw-away. But not quite.Picture quality is fair, sometimes even good. Zoomed shots get a bit fuzzy & the speed is not good enough to stop motion. The flash is minimally useful in a small room but useless elsewhere. Outdoor shots are much better than indoor. But picture quality can be improved considerably with good photo editing software. Like Photoshop or Paintshop Pro. It came with Vivitar Experience imaging software but as I already use Paintshop Pro, I haven't tried the included software.No, you're not gonna win any photo prizes with this camera.  But for a carry-in-the-pocket camera, it performs adequately. It is the total package at under $50 that makes this camera such a good buy.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!!!!!", "Author": "C. Robertson", "ReviewID": "R3AGG5XADWUV28", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. She is young, and I didn't want to spend too much money on a camera that might get dropped or left somewhere, so when I found a silver one at walmart for 39.99 I thought it was a great deal.  WRONG!!!!!!  I took a couple of pictures to test it out, and they all came out dark and blurry-even when the subjects were not moving.  We had bought some of the kid-tuff type cameras years before, (which are fun for the kids, but like a 1MP or less, so horrible pictures) and I would equate the picture quality to those!  I know the price was low, but I had expected way more for a 5 MP camera.  This camera is getting returned and we will spend $20-30 more to get something of a better quality.  I guess you do get what you pay for!!", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money, and try to get it back from Vivitar!", "Author": "Barry W.

Didn't work this time!  I'm a long time 35mm photographer and would rate my level of expertise at about 8.5.  I've used Vivitar products in my career because they represent a fairly high level of quality.  I've bought lenses, lens hoods, equipment bags, filters, tripods, etc.  Their stuff is nearly always high quality, well designed, and the fit and finish is nearly as good as OEM.  I bought three of these based on the history I'd had with their stuff.  I wanted to replace a 'back-up' camera I keep on hand for odd times.  My granddaughter used it for a few weeks but then called me one day and said that the pictures weren't very good.  I hadn't used it that much so I hadn't noticed because my main camera was doing fine.  I went to her house and looked at some of her photos she'd shot with it.  The quality of the shots was just awful!  The shots were dark and all of them were out of focus!  I took the time to start shooting some stuff in order to prove it or disprove it.  I shot over fifty frames under all light conditions and they were all uniformly Awful!  First, it was impossible to see the image on the small screen in any level of sunlight!  If I used it outdoors after dark the image on the viewfinder was completely black!  I was clearly disappointed because I had purchased what I thought would be an inexpensive camera that my grandchildren could use and instead I found that they were all completely unusable!  The finished photographs were seriously out of focus and really grainy.  I'm going to try to get Vivitar to either refund my money or maybe send me a higher level piece of gear.  I'd bought these at WalMart, and today while I was over there I noticed that they had a higher priced rig and I'm going to try to get them to swap it with me.  I'll let you know about any success I might have.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "No SOUND for video feature", "Author": "J.

Kohn \"kohnhed\"", "ReviewID": "RHXFDUUQ9RILB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A friend bought this for me to help me with my cigar photos for my cigar blog. Up til then, I was using my phone which actually ended up taking better photos than this camera. It's very frustrating. There are two switches. 15mm-30mm and 1.5m to infinity. The flash only works on the 1.5m switch. And the close ups are not accurate. It has a no shake option which doesn't seem to work. And the viewing screen is so small, I can't see the subject without my reading glasses. I have to take 20 photos to get 3-4 good ones. The flash is too bright. I have to tape a piece of tissue over it. Bottom line: It's not reliable. It looks good in the view finder but when I upload it to my computer, its out of focus. How can that be? I look forward to buying a much better camera. One reviewer is right. This is a camera you give your toddler. One last thing...the software is a pain. If you use the editing bay, it constantly gets stuck on the option you are using. It takes forever to edit the photo. And the absolute worst thing is that in order to use the software, you have to plug the camera in and keep it plugged in. I have to buy batteries 24 at a time. This gets expensive.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst camera I have ever owned!", "Author": "Tommyboy1981", "ReviewID": "R2FV8MPX9S5S6H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Now, I understand that this is not a camera that one should be buying for everyday use. I bought this camera for my 4 year old daughter. I didn't want anything expensive in case she dropped it, but she has gotten quite adept with our normal camera and I felt like she was ready for her own. I bought this for the price and figured while the pictures weren't going to be great quality, they would at least be passable for a 4 year old. I was very wrong. First off, the camera feels like a toy. It is plastic and so cheaply made. It is so light and junky feeling. The buttons are very unresponsive as well. Probably the worse feature on this camera is that when you take a picture, there is nothing to indicate that the picture has been taken if you don't have the flash on (And you don't want to use the flash because it takes in excess of ten seconds to shoot another picture while the flash recharges.). There is no beep or no picture to pop up on the LCD to let you know that it took the picture. The only way to know for sure is to look in the picture gallery, which is access by pressing the mode button twice. Pushing it only once, sends it to video mode, but you have to be careful because if you push it twice too fast, then it doesn't respond. Even it's size is a disappointment. It is kind of big and clunky for as light and minimally functional as it is.And last, and absolutely least, the picture quality is beyond abysmal. No matter how still you stand, every picture is grainy and super blurry. Even in the absolutely terrible LCD screen on the camera, they look blurry. On the bright side, you don't even have to take the memory card to the computer to know that you bought the most poorly made electronic device ever produced. I can't say a single good thing about this camera. I was irate that my daughter couldn't even take semi-usable pictures on Christmas Day. Even at 4, she looked at the pictures she took on the LCD and said that she thought they looked blurry. I didn't have the heart to show them to her on the computer later so she could see just how much worse they really were.There is no circumstance that you should ever give money to Vivitar for this product.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Spend more money on something decent", "Author": "qhorses", "ReviewID": "R22ILCNG437XA3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased at Walmart before I depoloyed to AFG because I didn't want to take my $250 camera.  Wished I would have spent more money and got one worth while.  Picture quality is really poor and it takes a long time to take a picture. Have to manually turn on the flash every time you turn it on.  I find battery life seems decent.  It has an auto turn off mode when you don't do anything for like a minute. I still got some decent pictures but will be buying another cheap camera for when I ride ATV and also don't want to wreak my nice one.

There is no mention of how to set the time/date.  It appears that all photos taken with my camera will have a date of 3/29/2009.  I noticed several people were also asking about sound on video.  There is no sound feature.  No mention of these lacking basic features is mentioned in the manual either.  The camera does not come with any memory card and won't work without one.
