{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review from a long time NEX user", "Author": "Josha D. Schwarzenbach", "ReviewID": "R1D1CGX39HYGEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting with the NEX system for a couple years now, starting with a NEX 5n. I am thankful I found this system because NEX is the reason I am so into photography today. Since the release of the original NEX 3 and NEX 5, Sony has done an excellent job at building a strong ecosystem with high and low end models for every type of shooter and every budget. The NEX 5 series is famous for being the best compromise in price and performance of all the other NEX cameras.Standard for the NEX 5 series the 5t has the following advantages vs. other cameras in its class:-Small size, yet powerful \"big camera\" performance.-Some of the best low light capabilities thanks to the Exmor sensor and 16 megapixels-High speed 10 FPS shooting for action/kids-Wifi and apps-Very fast auto-focus-Excellent video performance-A great lens lineup that keeps getting better each yearThis model, the NEX 5t, is another incremental upgrade for the NEX 5 series. It brings some cool and innovative features to the table. This year's model take all the great features from last year's 5r and adds NFC and  changes the kit lens to the 16-50 power zoom, making this system even more compact. The NFC is really cool because for those with android phones equipped with NFC, it means quicker pairing between the two devices. The only real drawback is for those NFC equipped laptops, windows doesn't support large file transfer. The new kit lens is a welcome edition.Now the NEX isn't a perfect system, but Sony has worked hard to introduce new features with every new release. The only problem with this is Sony decided it would be a good idea to release these features in incremental upgrades every year, rather than release big upgrades over a longer period of time. Those looking to upgrade from a NEX 5r will find themselves with mostly the same camera. Going from a NEX 5n, this may be a worth upgrade however. I really think the 5r and the 5t could have been the same camera.Sony's aggressive release cycles don't affect the performance of this camera, which is nothing short of amazing. Sony put a DSLR sized sensor in this tiny body, making for a potent but tiny camera. It has 10 FPS, faster than most canons/Nikons. It has quick autofocus. It has extremely good dynamic range (most people call this better picture quality). Sony's sensor has some of the best low light noise performance of any camera in its class, largely due to its 16 mega pixel count. One mostly unknown fact is that lower megapixels tend to have better low light performance, and high 24+ mega pixel sensors are historically nosier due to pixel density. I applaud Sony for keeping it at 16, and do not wish for the NEX line to move to 24 any time soon (excluding NEX 7).The NEX also has a very small distance between the lens mount and the sensor. This is a huge advantage because it allows for a wide range of adaptors to be made for the system. The Sony A mount adaptor offers all functionality of the alpha lenses on the small NEX. After market dealers have even created canon/Nikon mounts for the NEX, allowing the use of those lenses, minus the electronic functions (like autofocus). This is important because older lenses can be found for cheap on the used market, and gives the NEX one of the largest list of lenses to date.But no, even the NEX 5t isn't perfect. There are some small, but noticeable flaws with this system.-Small buffer, it can take 10 photos each second, but it can only do this for about 2 seconds before it slows down to fill the memory card. This is historically a problem with all Sony cameras, or any camera of this class.-Occasionally inaccurate auto focus. The AF system isn't quite up there with DSLR's, but its getting closer and closer each year.-Average battery life. I recommend a spare battery for long days.These shortcomings are all pretty minor and expected in a camera of this class, so I do not hold them against it. All 3 of these problems are due to its small size, which alone makes up for it.If you're coming from a smart phone, or a standard point and shoot, this camera will be a HUGE upgrade. Size alone makes this a worthy choice over larger DSLR's. The 5 in particular is the best price/performance compromise in the NEX line. For those a little strapped for cash, but still want similar performance look at the NEX 3n, mostly the same camera just much slow, plastic build, and weaker video performance compared to the 5t. If you want a little bit of an upgrade, look at the NEX 6, offering a viewfinder and a hot shoe.Feel free to ask me anything regarding this camera or any other NEX camera in the comment section, and I will try to respond quickly. I hope my review helped with your buying decision.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great photos and video if you're willing to overlook some annoyances", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R31ISWT4DU7OO7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The NEX-5T is Sony's midrange-ish mirrorless camera.  It's not as compact as the NEX-3, but is still much more pocketable than a lot of interchangeable lens cameras.  I've had the older NEX-5N for a couple of years and never really took to it, even though it produced great photos and videos.  It was just too much of a chore to use most of the time, so I ended up taking photos with my smartphone camera or my dSLR.  I had high hopes for the new NEX-5T, especially with its Wi-Fi support, but alas, the 5T is probably destined to sit in a bag most of the time too.PROS- Excellent photo quality- Great video quality- Very compact for an ILC- Articulating LCD- USB charging capability- Reasonably fast autofocusCONS- Not enough physical controls- Proprietary \"accessory port\"- No built-in flash- No external battery charger- Wi-Fi feature is just so-soDESIGNI really like the design of the NEX-5 series.  It's smaller than most mirrorless cameras, has a good grip and is pretty easy to carry around.  The new 16-50mm power zoom kit lens is much smaller than the old 18-55mm lens, making the whole kit just that much easier to carry around.  The power zoom lens takes a little getting used to and I'm not a huge fan of the power zoom, but it's fine.The LCD is nice and bright and articulates.  In addition to being able to shoot above your head or below your knees with the aid of the LCD, you can now also shoot selfies with ease.  The external flash does get it in the way, however.There are more physical controls on the NEX-5T than was on the NEX-5N, but it still lacks a PASM dial for whatever reason.  Sony included a new control dial for aperture value and shutter speed, but I personally would've preferred a shooting mode dial, like on the NEX-6.The NEX-5 series is the only NEX camera that still uses the old proprietary \"accessory port.\"  If you don't use a flash and don't want an EVF, then this might not be a big deal for you.  I personally avoid flash photography whenever possible, but it's not completely avoidable.  I actually have the larger flash unit (HVLF20S) from when I used my 5N, but it is a pain to put on and take off.  Leaving it on all full time takes away the compactness of the NEX-5, which is one of the primary benefits of having the NEX-5 in the first place.One neat thing about the NEX-5T is that it can be charged via USB.  So you could essentially charge it with your computer or maybe even your smartphone charger (microUSB).  The downside is that Sony no longer includes an external battery charger with the NEX-5, which is unfortunate.PHOTO & VIDEO QUALITYPhotos and videos look very good with the NEX-5T.  I've taken more photos with the 5N than the 5T, but I haven't had any complaints with either of them in regards to the quality of the shots.  I've been happy with the detail and color in nearly every photo I've taken.  I shoot mainly in RAW for the occasional exposure fixes, but I don't do too much in the way of post processing with Lightroom or Photoshop.  Videos also look great most of the time and I mainly use it to record my kids at recitals, pageants, talent shows, etc.  I normally use the 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 lens for those occasions.WI-FII don't use NFC so its inclusion in the 5T isn't a big deal for me, though, I suppose it might be for some.  I was, however, pretty excited about being able to use Wi-Fi to send photos to my phone or PC so I could share my shots on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.  I previously used an Eye-Fi card in my 5N, so to have built-in Wi-Fi and be able to use a high performance SD card was enticing.  Unfortunately, the iOS and Android apps aren't that great and its implementation isn't as intuitive to use as I would've hoped.  Beyond that, most of the downloadable in-camera Sony apps cost money and you're required to use a Sony account to download them -- no thanks.CONCLUSIONThe Sony NEX-5T takes terrific pictures and video and at $600 for the lens kit, is a pretty darn good deal.  However, if you can put up with a slightly larger size, the NEX-6 might be a better camera for only $150 more.  For one, it comes with a built-in flash and a real hotshoe for accessories.  It also includes an EVF, so when you're out in the sun and can't see your LCD at all, you can take the guess work out of it and get your shot.  Did I mention that the NEX-6 also has a physical PASM dial?  Yeah.  I think Sony has one too many NEXs, and the 5T is the one that really doesn't seem to have a proper place in the lineup.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the Sony NEX-3NL more", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R1H9ZZ8ZRMCLPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a white NEX-3NL I purchased last summer that I'm happy with, so I was very excited to try the NEX-5TL, thinking it would be a substantial upgrade over the 3NL. Personally, I don't think it is.Sony NEX-3NL/W Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera Kit (White)Not to say this is a bad camera, especially if you want Wi-Fi and NFC, which the NEX-3NL does not have. I don't own anything that uses NFC - Near Field Communication - (such as a newer model Android phone or tablet)-- and while the Wi-Fi feature is OK, I can live without it.  The Wi-Fi connects easily if you use the WPS button on your router, otherwise you will be entering the password on the screen manually. But the actual file transfer from camera to PC is slow, may be partially my network's fault, but I find myself just popping out the SD card and inserting it directly into my computer to get the photos off much quicker.Comparing the NEX-3NL with the NEX-5TL, a few points I'd like to make about each camera:LENS:* The cameras come with the same kit lens, the SELP16-50 (16mm to 50mm).FLASH:* The separate flash with the NEX-5TL camera is a pain to attach and limits your use of the articulated screen. That is, if you're lucky enough to get it connected with that tiny screw which doesn't grab hold 1/2 the time, you can't move the screen much with the flash attached.* The NEX-3NL has a built-in flash which can be held upwards to bounce the light. Although this flash also inhibits the use of the flip-up screen if trying to do a selfie with the flash. Still preferable to me because the flash is always there and ready, just push the flash button and it pops up. No need to attach the flash.PRICE:* The NEX-3NL is, as of my review date, $150 cheaper (but pricing can change from day-to-day on these cameras).LCD SCREEN:* The NEX-5TL has a touchscreen. I tried it for a couple days, and then disabled it in the Set-Up Menu. I hate greasy screens and it used substantially more battery power.* The NEX-3NL does not have the touchscreen feature.* The NEX-5TL has a better-looking screen over the NEX-3N, 921,000 vs. 461,000 pixels.RANDOM NOTES:If you are wondering what the difference in model number is:* NEX-5T is the camera, body only.* NEX-5TL is the camera with the kit lens included.* The older NEX-5RL is the same as the 5TL, but doesn't have NFC. Not having NFC on the NEX-5RL is the only difference I can find, and the NEX-5RL comes with a choice of lenses, either the Sony NEX5RL/B 16.1 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LED (Black), or the Sony NEX-5RK/B 16.1 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lenses (Black)* There are many Scene Settings, but no Pet Scene setting like my cheaper Sony Cyber-shot cameras have. Yes, I could probably tweak some manual settings with this camera for the same effect, but it's hit or miss when you have a fast-moving pet that won't hold still on command.* Neither camera does well at very close-up macro shots with the kit lens. I guess you need to buy another lens for macro, or back-off the subject a bit to get \"focus\".* This is a well-built line of cameras, no matter which NEX you choose. My NEX-3NL has been used constantly since I bought it last summer and I've had no problems.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good camera", "Author": "SN \"SN\"", "ReviewID": "R2HLJNDCVLVSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have not used a DSLR before and was in the market to get a camera that is comparable to SLR.  My wife wanted something that is not too big to carry around. My previous camera was a Canon S90, which is good, but I wanted something better than that.  Picture quality in NEX 5T is very good, it is easy to handle like a point and shoot.  I read some complaints about Sony's confusing menu, but I didn't have any problems with it.  The Power zoom lens is good, it gives a point and shoot feeling (good thing). There is barrel distortion at the wide angle.  Need a software to correct it.  So far I have used only iAuto and iAuto+ settings and the images came out good. I might add a fixed length pancake lens later.If you mount the flash, you may not be able to use the LCD to take self portraits.  I didn't try the NFC transfer, probably won't be a big deal for me as I dont have an Android phone.  I will post some pictures later (shot mostly with iAuto or iAuto+).  I couldn't find the software for Mac in Sony's website.  However, the PlayMemories app in my Windows pc works just fine. Also, I couldn't register as the product is not showing in Sony's support website menu yet.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "LCD Screen Tilts Up, Forward for Selfies AND Down for Overhead Shots", "Author": "DC Jakel", "ReviewID": "RJ40R1ZOSLZQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No need to repeat what others have praised or faulted with Sony's NEX compact camera system.Overall, I am very pleased with the features and performance of the 5T. My favorite feature with this compact camera is the ability to tilt the LCD screen down allowing the user to hold the camera overhead in order to shoot downward.Highly recommended.I purchased a Case Logic SLMC-200 Compact Systems Camera Case from Amazon. The case provides good protection and has room for the camera with power zoom lens attached, spare battery and a couple of lens filters.EDIT November 26, 2013: Downgraded my overall rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I continue to enjoy using the NEX, but the WiFi features, particularly the ability to transfer photos from the camera to an iPhone, is clunky and slow. What should be a simple process is confusing and slow. Sony, look at the app PhotoSync to see how easy photo transfers should be.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera, with a few quirks.", "Author": "C. Weaver", "ReviewID": "R1C8LSO09OGOPQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX-5TL is a fantastic mirrorless digital camera that supports multiple lens. it has a large sensor that produces great photos in low light especially with the optical image stabilization. This large sensor also produced really nice quality HD movies. With built in WiFi and NFC sharing photos is also fairly quick and fairly easy although the WiFi capabilities with the companion PlayMemories Mobile application is pretty basic. The remote viewfinder is a great way to frame and take a shot on a remotely tripod mounted camera giving the shooter an easy way to be a part of the photos while still maintaining control beyond a simple timer.I was especially impressed with the quick and accurate auto focus, even in low light. If you need more light the included detachable flash will light up your subject, although a bit too much if the subject is close. It would have been nice if the camera had a basic LED flash for adding just a little light to close subjects without the full size flash being attached.The camera has a few neat apps you can download, although a couple are free such as a flickr add on and the smart remote. Sony has taken this too far by charging $5 and $10 a piece for capabilities like motion shot, time lapse, lens correction, multiple exposure and bracket control. This was a great idea to have apps you can install and add capability to the camera after it was shipped and keep the camera from getting too complex with apps you wouldn't use. I am not happy with the price which currently is over $50 to add all the available apps.The camera is a bit confusing to use at first with a mixture of touch screen, dynamic physical buttons (screen shows function) and dials that are physical and screen based. After a bit of use I warmed up to the controls and have been able to take control pretty well. At times annoying but helpful are the on screen help pop ups that describe each function and setting. No need to run to the manual to look up what some setting means or how it works. Best of all the touch screen is very responsive and works as well as your tablet.As with most mirrorless cameras there is no viewfinder included but the touch screen display is easy to see in all but the most glaring sunlight. It also tilts out and allows you to use the camera down low or overhead with the screen angled for easy viewing. I found this to allow me to take a lot more candid photos as the camera rested on my chest so I didn't cause the subject to strike a pose whenever I pulled the camera up to my face. The display also flips all the way around for perfectly posed \"selfies\" UNLESS you have the flash attached. Sure you don't want to use the flash for a close up selfie but you won't want to be taking the flash off and storing it every time you take one. And speaking of flash, this is a proprietary connector, not a standard DSLR type hot shoe.The built in microUSB based charging is a really nice feature for on the go charging, No need to carry around a base plate and charging cord when you travel. However it also means no external charger to keep a second battery topped off as it takes about 2 hours to fully recharge. Fortunately you can buy a charger with extra batteries.I have mixed emotions about the lens. It has both a dial and slider to control zoom, but both are motorized. The dial zoom ring is awkward as you don't have direct control of the zoom, you turn the dial which activates a motor, which adjusts the zoom. I feel a major disconnect of control with the function. Strangely enough next to the dial is a slider control to zoom in and out. This I liked for movies as it gave smooth control for the zoom and made a professional looking zoom with the ability to control the speed by how far you pushed the slider. I just wish this was a hybrid so the dial gave me direct control for quicker zooms when taking photos.Overall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it as the photos are great and it is easy to use. The minor issues listed above would not keep me from choosing this camera again as the image quality and ease of use more than outweigh any opportunities for improvement.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "**BUYERS BEWARE!** Awesome camera BUT ORDER FROM SONY instead!", "Author": "Jenny C", "ReviewID": "R17E98ZYP8XQJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything about this camera is amazing. Sharp quality, compact, good battery life and quick shutter speeds and it does what I need it to do and happy with the results. I am giving it a 5 star considering that this is a product review and I'm not going to knock off any stars because I had other issues.***THE \"OTHER\" ISSUES***As far as the seller that my camera was shipped from, which was Focus Camera, my product seemed to be in used condition, it did not come with the manufacturer's seal, product tags with info or stickers. For the most part, unless it is an open box item or display item, it will have all those things in the box. My shipment also did not come with a battery and the top right part of the LCD screen is warped like someone had pressed really hard on it and did not retain the shape. I kept this product and complained to Amazon Customer service and they had sent me a replacement product within 2 days. I received the second shipment and come to find out that it was the same exact issue, used condition with all the product labels, tags, etc. were missing and on the bottom of the camera there are scratches on the part where you would screw the camera onto a tripod. Same LCD issue with a bigger warped area more on the middle right hand corner where there is supposed to be an orange sticker if the product was brand new. I had even gone out of my way to go to a local Best Buy store and even their floor display had orange stickers all over it with the product tags. Their product was in perfect condition even though it was a display, no screen warping whatsoever so BUYERS BEWARE.This is not acceptable if you are paying for a BRAND NEW ITEM. I've never had a problem with Amazon products so I'm used to ordering stuff on there so I didn't think to order it anywhere else and I've never had a used product sent to me. I am in the process of returning both cameras and ordering it directly from Sony which is what I should've done in the first place, but I hope this helps.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "A well crafted camera with interchangeable lens", "Author": "eau", "ReviewID": "R13YHT7OPW6AL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Alpha NEX-5T is the updated version of previous NEX-5R. NEX-5T is the camera body and NEX-5TL is the body plus a 16-50mm lens kit. NEX-5T is virtually the same as the 5R with the addition of NFC radio.Having owned the Cyber-shot RX100, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to try the NEX-5TL. Loosely speaking, RX-100 is a compact point-n-shoot camera while the NEX-5TL is a rangefinder camera. With NEX-5T, you have over a dozen E-mount lenses to choose from, as well as an optional viewfinder. With RX-100, everything is self-contained in the camera body. At the end of this review, I'll highlight some key areas that I observed between the two cameras. For Now, I will focus on the NEX-5TL.The NEX-5TL is fairly compact and light. The body is mostly smooth, save the textured grip. The body is so small that any lens attached to it would dominate the whole camera. The on/off switch is a thumb flick switch surrounding the shutter release, as opposed to a button located elsewhere on most compact cameras. This is handy since you can quickly flick the switch and start pressing the shutter release like you would on most DLSR cameras.The LCD screen is crisp, spec'ed at 921,600 pixels. It's vivid and bright (but still hard to see in direct sunlight). It is articulated and can be tilted up by 180 degrees for arm's length self-portraits (caveat: can't do this when the flash is attached - more of this later). The touch screen LCD is of capacitive touch, so you can install the official semi-hard screen protector over it without problems. By the way, the touch screen is a finger magic. It probably would require wiping often enough that a screen protector is recommended to avoid scratches.There is no built-in flash. However, an external flash is supplied and can be attached to the camera via the Smart Accessory Terminal type 2 shoe on top of the camera. Attaching the flash with a lens already attached can be a challenge since the barrel of the lens is higher than the shoe, providing less clearance to engage a screw to secure it to the camera. Do expect instant attachment at the last minute when you need the flash. Once attached, the flash can be flipped down and remain low in order to maintain portability. When needed, the flash can then be flipped up at 45 degrees.The video mode features its own button next to the command dial. Pressing the button would start/stop filming video immediately, regardless of what previous shooting mode you were in. Mic are located at the top of the camera for stereo recording.NFC connectivity is useful for transferring your pictures to your NFC enabled smartphones and uploading to your social networks. If you have an Apple iDevices, you will have to revert back to the WiFi connectivity, which takes a little more effort to set up. I don't have an Android device so I can't test the connectivity.When it comes to performance, NEX-5TL fairs pretty well with compact DSLR's. The bundled lens isn't the greatest or the sharpest but it is very compact when retracted. The Hybrid AF system is very fast and accurate. In low light conditions, the AF system still hunts occasionally. The Hybrid AF only works with compatible E lens (I think there are currently 2 lenses that don't support it, in which case the AF defaults to phase detection). You can also use direct manual focus as well and the camera provides manual focus assist (enlarge port of the frame) for you to fine tune your focus. You can also have the camera auto focus and then do your manual fine tuning.Low-light shooting is excellent. I can shoot in the city night light conditions at up to ISO 3200 with great results, thanks to the large sensor and optical image stabilizer in the lens . However, any settings beyond ISO 3200 become very noisy.Pros:+ APS-C sized sensor+ interchangeable lenses+ fast Hybrid AF system (phase detection and contrast detection)+ articulated, high resolution LCD with touch control+ full HD @ 24fps, 60fps+ NFC  & WiFi connectivity+ SD/SDHC/SDXC & Memory Stick Pro/Pro-HG Duo memory cards compatibleCons:- external flash attachment- flash attachment obstructing LCD articulationThe NEX-5TL is a great camera, compact and light, and yet rivals entry level DSLR's. Comparing to the RX-100, which is similarly priced, I would go with the RX-100. RX-100 is smaller, lighter and has a built-in flash and a 3.6x lens. It is pretty easier to carry the RX-100 in one's pocket all the time and do candid shots when the occasion rises. The NEX-5TL, although small, is not exactly pocket sized, and its external flash would create some challenges to being fully portable and always ready. This is not to say that RX-100 trumps RX-5TL. Both takes excellent pictures and perform comparably well. But I prefer the former for its smaller size and being fully self-contained. If you want a rangefinder type camera with interchangeable lens, NEX-5TL is a great choice to consider.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent offering - but consider the NEX-6 instead", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R17WUX3F21C5XX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very competent performer - quick startup, excellent low noise images, very intuitive to use, great build quality, and awesomely compact.In fact, this camera would rate 5-stars from anyone who had not used the NEX-6.Unfortunately, the features missing from the NEX-5 are precisely what made the NEX-6 such a joy to use:1. The NEX-6 has a hugely useful mode selector (PASM) - rather than the soft-key based selector on the NEX-5.2. The NEX-6 has a very usable control screw on the top - rather than that on the NEX-5.3. The NEX-6 has a built in strobe - the NEX-5 has an ill-designed add-on that interferes with LCD motion.4. The NEX-6 has an extra assignable hard button (AEL) - the NEX-5 does not.5. The NEX-6 has an external strobe hotshoe - the NEX-5 does not.6. The NEX-6 has an optical viewfinder - the NEX-5 does not.Whether these options are worth the extra price premium is a personal decision, but I expect the answer to be yes - especially given that the target segment for these cameras includes photographers who desire DSLR style performance in a compact package.Final notes:The NEX-5 suffers from the same software quirks as the NEX-6. There still is a strobing issue on the LCD in AF-C mode; and it still lacks the Auto ISO mode with min/max limits (which is amazing on the A99.)Finally, the two features unique to the NEX-5 are a touch screen LCD and Near Field Communications.Of these, I found the touch screen particularly useful when using Tracking AutoFocus (a huge improvement over the NEX-6). On the other hand, NFC does not fit into my digital workflow - so I cannot speak to its utility or function.Happy photography!~A_E~", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Former compact digital camera user review", "Author": "error", "ReviewID": "RHV4OXE081PBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for those who, like me, have never before used anything but a compact digital camera for their photography needs.  Sony NEX-5TL is an upgrade for me from Samsung 12.2 megapixel camera with 4.6X optical zoom.  That being said, this is not just an upgrade, this is a huge leap forward into an unknown territory for me.  I was both excited and nervous at first.  Excited because I heard these cameras have much-much greater picture quality.  And, nervous, because I thought I\u2019d have to take a course in professional photography to get the full benefit out of this camera.  I am happy to tell you, that I was both right and wrong, in that order.On Day 1, I have mastered all of the camera\u2019s features w/o referring to the manual.  All of the functionality, all of the options are well explained on the 3.0 inch touchscreen LCD.  So, as you scroll through the menus and go through the setup, you will learn all the ins and outs of what this camera can do.  And it can do a lot!  But I\u2019m sticking to its automatic features for now.  It\u2019s easy to use.  The quality of pictures is superb.  The camera is a great upgrade and I give it 5 stars.  The most useful feature for me is transferring pictures from camera to my Mac over WiFi.Some Things Worthy of Noting:1. This camera could use a better, more comfortable neck strap.  It looks and feels cheap.2. There is no internal memory in this camera.  You\u2019ll need to purchase an SDHC memory card.3. The external flash, when installed, will prevent the screen from tilting all the way to the front.  So, if you are in a low light area and want to take a picture of yourself, well, you\u2019ll just need to ask someone to take it for you.On Day 2, I have bought a new lens - Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 lens.  Yes, I feel ready to upgrade and I want to be able to take great pictures when zooming in on distant subjects.  This lens fits NEX-5T and provides a wide focal range of up to 315mm.  This is ideal for sports and nature shooting.  I\u2019m sure you are aware by now that Sony NEX-5T accepts Sony E-mount lenses.  This opens up a world of endless creative options.On Day 3, I have bought a case.  I recommend Case Logic SLMC-201 for your Sony NEX-5T.  It\u2019s cheap and will protect your new investment in memory foam-lined interior and plush padding.On Day 4, I have sold my old Samsung compact camera.Day 5 and Onward, I am very happy with this camera and I\u2019m never going back to compact digital cameras.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is fantastic, lens so so.", "Author": "Michael B", "ReviewID": "RGJPRG5TSYUJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is everything the reviews say plus some.

Had to return the kit and buy the body and lens separately.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for those who already have DSLR or for those who do not but want to take great photos.", "Author": "Comp Expert \"Comp\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZUGZVHVNAL8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IntroThere's so many cameras out there on the market and I tried to analyze from a consumer's perspective where this camera would fit in.  In my opinion, it would cater to a) those with a larger budget seeking a high performance camera but have little knowledge of photography and no DSLR experience or b) Those who already have a DSLR but are tired of a traditional DSLR's unwieldy size and want something more pocketable (Yes, remember how you hate that amazing DSLR when trying to travel light on vacation?).In both cases, I believe this camera would be ideal and I have to recommend it after using the device for several weeks, including a recent barrage of holiday photo shooting.  It lives up to its name in producing clear images and excellent low light use without the need for a flash.  The touchscreen is useful & rotates for self portraits, to which the widescreen 24mm equivalent lens captures everything close up.  Fit and finish is high, and the size truly compact.  It will truly go wherever you want to go with ease rather than a hindrance.LensThe kit lens is a 16-50 which is equivalent to 24mm lens with the unit's 1.5 crop factor.  This makes the camera have true wide angle capabilities to take in sweeping vistas.  More important through is the ability to capture self portraits without requiring extra-long arms.  Top end is equivalent to 75mm.  Now I know many others might slam this as being too weak as only about 2x zoom but it's enough.  Truly enough.  Wide angle is far more useful for everyday photography than a high zoom lens.  Zooms also incur significant issues with light gathering ability until you creep into some crazy expensive level priced lens that would cost more than the camera itself.  So was this lens a good choice by Sony?  Absolutely!I found the bokeh on it to be pretty good considering its only a kit lens.  Not anywhere near as good as my 85mm Rokinon on a D5100 but way better than the 18-55 kit lens that came with the same camera.Low light performance is amazing when at lower fstops and of course drops off markedly the higher you zoom in. You want to keep the zoom minimized.  Speaking of which, by default the zoom comes with digital zoom activated. You want to deactivate it to get the best quality.  Digital zoom can be done on any computer, even 20 year old models can do it.  Nothing amazing to this function.Lens is, of course, removable so you can buy other compatible lenses.  If you don't have a DSLR camera you'll probably go crazy and want to buy a lot of other sizes - go for it and get ready to go into debt for a month or two.  Those who have DSLRs will probably find the kit lens just perfect for their needs though.AutofocusMirrorless lens design means the unit can lock on to focus at speeds that only can dreamt by with those on traditional DSLR's with LCD screen mode. It's rather startling to snap shots that quickly.  Even in low light, the autofocus worked so well that I loved using it rather than cried when using LCD mode on a D5100.Flash photographyFrom the get-go, you'll think flash photography was an afterthought on this camera.  It uses an external flash device that attaches to the top of the unit.  The flash itself has a flimsy, almost toy-like, feel to it. No doubt it's external to reduce physical size of the camera while retaining the ability to reduce red eye.  I'm pleased by this decision since it does reduce unnecessary size and weight of the unit.  Compromising a flash to be smacked more into the body would've created serious red eye effects.  Otherwise, I can't really give much more criticism of the flash as I am not one who enjoys flash photography at all.Built-in wifi/NFCOne of the highly touted features is built in WIFI and NFC connection.  The process of activating WIFI is somewhat confusing, as you need to launch an application to do it rather than just click a button to activate. You also must have the appropriate software installed on your phone.  Using an android phone, the download process was much faster than those old clunky eye-fi cards I have used, but still pretty pokey when doing massive file transfers of hundreds of photos, where it's still going to be easier to just take the card out and transfer through a card reader. Therefore I see this as much more of a niche feature than useful one.NFC itself never worked reliably on my Samsung Note 3 phone.  However, I have read others have faced this same problem.Speaking of applications, there are external apps you can download.  Some free and some not.  I did not try them all as working on the tiny screen did not appeal to me when I have a phone, laptop and desktop all with much larger screens.Size/weight/ErgonomicsWeighs about 14oz, which is a shade under 1lb.  The screen will rotate but it does not pivot.  Handle is creased well for one-hand operation.  Screen is capacitive touchscreen and implemented well.  Button placement relatively logical.  No complaints about any of this.Recharging / Battery lifeRecharging is made through the usb port.  There is an included AC adapter.  Overall recharge time was relatively quick at under 2 hours for total depletion.Battery life was somewhat mediocre by DSLR standards but average at regular compact cameras.  The culprit is no doubt the LCD screen which needs to be on all the time for photo takes, unlike the ability to use the optical viewfinder on a DSLR which dramatically reduces battery drain. With some light to moderate spontaneous shooting going on, I didn't feel too comfortable going past 2 days without a recharge.  Wi-fi activation also increases battery drain as you'll see the battery % indicator dribble down pretty quickly.ConclusionOverall, I believe Sony has done a good job at designing this camera.  A lot of thought went into choosing a kit lens that would deliver results consumers want to have - wide angle is one of the most useful features for a travel and everyday lens setup. Autofocus is amazingly fast and the large whopping sensor size ensures great flash-free images even under dark light conditions.  Imagery will blow away any regular consumer level camera and of course absolutely destroy any phone camera.  I cringe at those taking important photos with just their phones - what a horrible way to archive important epic events in your life.Does this camera suit one who does not have DSLR but wants superior images over anything else yet remaining compact in size ?  Yes.  Does this suit those with DSLs but are sick and tired of a large DSL in everyday use?  Yes.  The camera is compact such that you will take it everywhere without a sweat.  This unlike a DSLR where I often labor to take my D5100, which in itself is known to be a \"small\" DSLR of its size.My only real criticism is the flakey wifi connectivity of the camera.  It needs improvement.  But this does not detract from the main purpose of the camera - to take pictures.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Quoad Toad", "ReviewID": "R3GPO4D13X8PF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Sony NEX-5N and now an NEX-5TL.  I am very happy with the NEX line of cameras.  The NEX-5TL contains a few upgrades from the 5N - including a new automatic mode, flip up screen, wi-fi, and NFC.  The lens is also different.  Despite the new features of the 5TL, I have found that the picture quality is about the same as the NEX-5N.  If you already own a 5N, upgrading will give you a few new features.The lens on the 5TL is significantly smaller than the 5N lens.  It makes the camera more pocketable and lighter.  You still can't really fit it in a pocket, but it's easier to carry on trips.  The lens on the 5TL is electronic and the zoom is controlled on the lens itself as opposed to the camera.  I thought it would be great upgrading to this new electronic lens, but I find that having the zoom controlled by electronically isn't that important to me.The camera still takes great pictures.  Right out of the box, you can begin snapping and taking nice pictures.  I'm still learning about all the functions of my new camera.  The 5TL will work for both amateurs and prosumers.  It's easy to start taking pictures on it, but it also takes some time to master all of its functions.  In general, I dislike flash photography and the 5TL does well in low light.  I can snap pictures in low light without worrying about blur.  The problem with low light images, is that as the ISO goes up, the noise level goes up.  I still get a lot of noise in my low light images and some need to be touched up in Photoshop.  I still appreciate being able to get non-blurry images without using a flash.The camera is quick to focus compared to other cameras in its class.  I found it takes a little longer to focus than my 5N, but doesn't take so long to cause issues.  If you have a fast memory card, you can take up to 10 images with one push of the shutter.  I love this ability since I take a lot of pictures of my dogs who move so much that taking one picture at a time, makes it difficult to get a great photograph.Another great feature of this camera is the ability to flip up the screen and take self portraits or to even be able to set it down and get into a family photo.  There is one huge issue with the flip up screen and that is that it can't flip up entirely when the flash is on.  I find this extremely frustrating because I like to keep the flash attached to my camera.Overall, the 5TL is a great camera and I highly recommend it.  Admittedly, I'm a huge fan of the NEX camera line.  I especially recommend this camera for those who enjoy tinkering with different settings, but who also just want to be able to take out the camera and take good pictures.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The size of a point-and-shoot with similar quality to a DSLR", "Author": "J. Maxon", "ReviewID": "RYYY7YZBQB1OM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm amazed at how small and lightweight this camera is. Especially since the image sensor is comparable to the one on the Sony Alpha SLT-A77. The body of this camera is similar to the size of a point-and-shoot, but with a much higher picture quality. Part of this is do to the ability to swap out lenses; like on a typical DSLR/SLT model. But of course, these lenses are much smaller.A disadvantage with this camera over a typical point-and-shoot is the range of the zoom. For example, on a Sony DSC-WX300/B, you get a 20x zoom (35mm equivalent of 25-500mm), but with this NEX-5TL, the kit lens maxes out at 50mm. The idea is you would switch out lenses depending on what type of shot you are taking, but there is some inconvenience (and extra costs) with doing so.I also found it awkward to have the mechanical zoom on the lens itself, rather than by the shutter button; in this sense it's more like a DSLR than a point-and-shoot. But after retraining my muscle memory, I found that this wasn't that big of a deal. In fact, I love the special focusing ability this camera gives me. The NEX-5TL provides the option to autofocus, then manual focus. After autofocusing, a slightly twist of the lens blows up the image on the LCD screen, showing a digitally zoomed preview of the subject; which goes in closer than the final shot. From there I get a clearer view of what I want to focus on, and thus end up with a sharper image. This is the only camera I've had that lets me do this, and to me, it's an invaluable option. But keep in mind that the focus and zoom use the same motion, so if you twist too far, the zoom kicks in.Besides better image quality, another advantage the NEX-5TL has over a typical point-and-shoot is the ability to tweak advanced settings such as shutter speed, aperture priority, and ISO. You might have noticed by viewing the product photos that the NEX-5TL does not have a mode dial. This may seem disconcerting at first, but don't worry; it's there. Unlike a standard SLR, it's not on the camera body, it's viewable from the LCD screen. Meaning, it's a setting in the camera, digitally, not physically. At first I wasn't thrilled with this, but after getting the sequence of button presses down, I found it was fairly easy to access. And because there's no physical mode dial, you get a smaller and lighter camera. All the advanced features you are used to on a DSLR/SLT are available in this compact model. Something experienced camera operators can't live without.If you don't consider yourself an experienced photographer, or just want a quick solution, the camera has modes that makes this easy to do. Such as the background defocus you can adjust by turning the control wheel. I'm impressed with how well this works, which takes the guesswork out of tweaking the aperture controls. There is an assortment of picture effects too, which I typically don't use; I prefer to Photoshop my images afterwards. That said, I do like the Partial Color option (creates an image which retains the specified color, but converts others to black and white). Most cameras with this feature only allow for one color, but with the NEX-5TL, you can choose between blue, red, green, and yellow. This is great for shooting things like flowers and butterflies.The 16-50mm kit lens is perfect for landscape and indoor shots. But if you want to head to a zoo or take pictures of birds, you'll want to consider something like the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 Lens for Sony NEX Cameras. The battery life is pretty good, and charges inside the camera so there's no need for a separate battery charger. Another nice feature is that the camera uses a standard Micro USB cable (for charging and connecting to a PC); so no need for extra cables--unlike some camera manufacturers. Just don't forget to get a SD memory card (or other supported type); the camera itself has no internal memory whatsoever.Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera. The fact that I can take RAW images on something so small is very useful. It's not as powerful as my Sony SLT-A99V, but very comparable to my Canon EOS Rebel T3i. When I want to travel light, the NEX-5TL has become my camera of choice. Where it doesn't have the wide zoom range (in a single lens) of a typical point-and-shoot, it does give me quality similar to a crop-sensor DSLR, but in a much smaller and more convenient package.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "It seems the one I got is used.", "Author": "Haiying Fu", "ReviewID": "R29MH47P4VF5FD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It seems the one I got is used.

The photos it produced were fantastically clear and bright. I was given the opportunity to have the newest version NEX-5TL at 16.1mp. Let's face it, there are a lot of small cameras out there today that takes really great photos. But the pickens get somewhat slim when the person buying the camera doesn't have a degree in photography, but still wants a professional camera. This NEX-5 fills the bill. Why? Because it come with great settings that make this little beauty take perfectly clear & bright pics called Superior Auto. This setting takes Auto Focus to a new level of performance that doesn't require you to be a pro and still get those perfect shots. And its really nice that you can take shots in .jpg and RAW at the same time, which enables you to have your basic clean cut photo and a RAW copy that can be edited beyond belief with the proper software and its doesn't have to be the super expensive Adobe Photoshop. This camera shoot really fast, comes with an adequate flash, has wonderful battery life and what is really great is its compact size. Granted, its not as small as some, but with a full size sensor. OK, this camera has more features than I will probably ever use, like WiFi, Bluetooth, interchangeable lenses and lots more. All I know I I want a great camera in a small package that is really and truly automatic that take super great photos of any type that won't break the bank and won't require a degree to operate it. This camera fits that requirement perfectly.So if you are looking for a review from a person with a Masters in photography that owns several 5k cameras and makes a living at it, look elsewhere. However, if you are anything like me and just want a light weight camera that will shoot perfect pics fast and has more features than you'll ever need, take a close look at the Sony NEX5TL, you won't be disappointed.

It has a full size image sensor for low noise and high light sensitivity - it enables the camera to take images with a high degree of detail and the camera great in low light situations.  It accepts interchangeable E-mount lenses.  It has an amazing flip-up and tilt LCD touch screen with a high-pixel density so images are super clear and you can easily frame and even manually focus shots well if you choose to do so without a viewfinder.  It has almost all the latest bells and whistles such as Wi-Fi, NFC, face recognition, a fast autofocus, touch-to-focus, and full-HD video recording at 60-frames-per-second, etc.  The one thing it does not have is a built in flash.  Surprise!  That's right folks, Sony sacrificed functionality for form factor and this camera does not have a built-in pop-up flash.  It comes with a separate flash unit that you have to plug in and screw onto the top of the unit, which is a pain in the #$$ and I think it kills the overall flexibility of the camera.  If you're buying this camera instead of a larger DLSR, are you going to want to carry a flash around with you, either in your pocket, or mounted on top of the unit where it can be easily damaged?  Sony has other cameras in the NEX line with a built in, pop-up flash such as the NEX-3NL/B.  Why couldn't they have made this camera body slightly larger to accomodate a built in a flash?  What was Sony thinking?  It seems like such an afterthought.  You either have to have the flash unit with you and/or attached at all times or do without the flash.  Either way it limits your flexibility.  A lot of photos are taken indoors, with friends or at functions, etc. and you need a flash.  I want to be able to grab this camera and go.  I don't want to have to think about whether the flash is attached or not.  It's not even like its a hotshoe flash (which this camera does not support, no hotshoe on this model).  Its a dinky little flash.  For me, this takes what could have been a great compact camera and relagates it to only good.  And what a shame considering all of the other technology they put into this thing.

Its not a huge lens (17-50mm) but it has a zoom that extends out when in use. It comes with a strap, battery, very small usb plug and usb/ac adapter. The usb cable is way too small (about 15 inches) so I had to purchase a 6 foot one seperately. Sony also gives you a mini flash attachment which is decent for most but its probably got the same strength that a normal small point and shoot has so its not super powerful. You can get a bigger flash but it costs $150. It needs to go in the hotshot/accessory port on the top, its not built in.I also purchased [...] Wasabi power battery and charger. One battery isn't enough and then having to plug your camera into either a computer or ac plug to charge it doesn't work for most. This is something Sony needs to fix. I would like a charger that doesn't need to have the camera plugged in because you can't recharge additional batteries and use the camera at the same time.APS-C sensor which is in many the full size DSLR's. Its a 16mp with ISO from 100-256000. It does full 1080 HD movies in mp4 or AVCHD. Also has wifi to send images to your phone or tablet and near field technology to tap your phone to caper for image uploads. There are tons of settings on the camera like iAuto and scenes which you can specify particular settings for night time, sunsets, portrait , landscape etc. You also have the capability to go full manual or shutter, aperture etc. So although its small footprint, you have the same freedom as a full size DSLR.The startup is instant, the 3\" lcd screen is crisp and bright and tilts all the way up. there's a selection wheel like on many other cameras. as well as a few other buttons. Although many of the buttons will not be needed if you choose to use the touch screen instead. The screen has a pretty responsive touch sensitivity but its a greasy fingerprint magnet. I've purchased a screen protector which will help keep things more under control. Constantly wiping it, i was afraid of scratching it so hopefully when i get the protector this will keep things safe.As for the photos...i'm very impressed. I'm an amateur photographer and have tried/own many types of cameras over the last few years from full size DSLR's, Mirror-less, to high end point and shoots. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised not only with the small size of the camera but the impressive shots it took in just my tests. The autofocus is super fast and taking a photo to saving it is also fast. if you do not have the quick view of the shot you took on, there is no lag at all. My needs in a camera are image quality, fast focus, fast saves. The lens has a manual zoom ring as well a  a slider and its fast and gets that new focus quickly. This camera has it. I can go on and on about things but this review would turn into a book.Small things I didn't like about the camera were, the menu's were a little hard to navigate thru. I found that scrolling using the touchscreen got annoying because when your trying to scroll you select instead. Some of the placement of certain items seemed out of place in the sections they were in. I couldn't easily find format card at first. Maybe it just takes a bit of time to get used to sony's camera os. The other was charging battery in the camera and small usb cable. Those most people will fix like I stated above.Overall if you are looking for DSLR quality and its options but don't want a huge camera I would definitely give this one a try.
