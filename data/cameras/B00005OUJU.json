{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mixed news", "Author": "Brian Dunham", "ReviewID": "R282FLDXF7Y3GC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am new to digital cameras, and picked up one of these.  I found a few things that I didn't care for (see the reviews for the 318, similar comments).  First, the focusing process seemed slow, I'd guess upwards of a second to focus.  Second, the display image, when using it as a viewfinder, was very dark and hard to use.  In display mode (reviewing your pics) it was also quite coarse and grainy.  It also seemed to have what in a film camera would be a very slow shutter speed-inside, with room light (and flash) it had a tendency to blur pics unless the camera was held rock steady.I am exchanging it for a Fuji 2600, for only slightly more money.  To me, it seems to be a better camera, and has none of the problems described above. LCD display is much sharper and brighter, doesn't seem to have the same propensity to bluring, and is a 3X optical zoom to boot.I really wanted to like the HP, due to familiarity with their other products.  In all honesty, it seems to be a very solid camera, and would probably preform adequatly.  Setup of the software was simple and straightforward.", "Date": "December 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "Don't let low reviews fool you", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2XUZOINIDWU2O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great entry level digital camera. The pictures look good, even on the lowest quality setting. In response to the people who say the pictures are too dark, use some \"photo-sense\" and don't shoot into unlit corners. Or, simply force the flash option.I particularly enjoy the large photo capacity. One the low setting the camera can hold 110+ pictures. If you find the need to take pictures on the maximum quality setting, an expandable memory card is recommended.The only thing keeping me from awarding the 5th star is the fact that the AC adapter is sold separately, which is necessary if you plan to use the camera to recharge batteries. If you own a charger, then it's a moot point.Let me say again for clarity, this is a great entry level camera. The photography enthusiast may not be won over, but for shooting birthday parties, holiday gatherings, and Jimmy's T-ball game, this camera is a good buy.", "Date": "March 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "am pleased", "Author": "meto \"meto\"", "ReviewID": "R3KDW0438Q8P3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera, got tired of missed photos only discovered when developed  on my 35mm....I am so impressed with the HP612.. the set up is easy, using the camera for a novice like me made me look good.

Have printed my downloads on regular paper, still experimenting, and they came great.  The only con, and that's why I gave the camera 4 stars, is that the HP program allows all manipulation except \"reducing red eye\".

I think this is a great camera!  It's extremely easy to use!!  I found the software so easy to install...I didn't need to refer to the manual!  The downloading of photos to your system (I have a HP computer as well) goes fast (no sitting around waiting for the download).  For personal use...it's perfect.  The photo quality is excellent.  The only 2 \"con's\" I have for this camera is:  getting used to having to hold down the shutter button to allow the camera to adjust for 1-2 seconds before actually taking the photo (some great shots were missed until we got the hang of it).. and the fact that it goes through batteries like water.  It also doesn't come with the ACD Adaptor - so that is an additional expense - but rechargeable batteries are the answer!Overall - a great investment!!!", "Date": "January 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Highly Reccomend It", "Author": "Matt M \"nothingisworking2\"", "ReviewID": "R3KNOUA0M7IO3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After shopping around long and hard, I finally decided on the HP 612. I think my biggest reason for choosing it was the optical zoom. Which by the way, works quite well. No one ever seems to talk about picture quality in reviews. Well I'm going to. The pictures as they come straight out of the camera are a little bit grainy. But it comes with ACD photo software, and all you have to do is click enhance, despeckle, and adjust your level, and it looks better than a lot of point and shoot 35mm cameras. It captures skin tones very well, it captures the complex greens in outdoor settings, and the lighting is very accurate. I'm very pleased with the quality of the photos after playing with them in the software.It has a very nice preview screen, as most digital cameras now do, and a very simple interface. Its somewhat bulky, but still very comfortable to use. And you just don't find optical zoom in this price range. Overall, I think I made the best decision for my price range and needs, and I highly reccomend this camera.", "Date": "July 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "2.3MP is all you need for great 5\"x7\" photos", "Author": "Blake M.

After watching my friend blow [money] on a 4MP camera that he will never use to its full potential I decited that this was the camera for me.  It is realy simple to use and is a very tough camera compared to what is out there today.  I only noticed two problems: 1 is that it goes through batt like water (I highly recomend a batt charger and a CF card reader), and 2 that is slows down when taking high res pictures.  Other than that the CF expantion slot is nice (I have 128MB which gets 1953 low res, 277 med res, and +100 high res pictures) and I recomend it to any one who needs a good digital camera", "Date": "July 3, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good Digicam", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R392JAHXGWEI0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I have found it quite nice.

The picture quality is amazing and with 2x optical and 2x digital zoom it can get upclose. The only problem i have found is that it eats up batteries incredibly quickly.

It is easy to follow the display indicators as they are similar to what most people would be used to in a non-digital camers. Focusing is simple; viewing pictures on the LCD display is simple; deleting unwanted pictures from memory is easy. The easiest part is uploading pictures to your PC--the software installs itself, and the pictures can be set to upload automatically if the camera is turned on when attached to the USB port on your PC. The camera comes with a set of alkaline batteries, a wrist strap and a USB cable. It is hard on batteries if you use the LCD display a lot, so purchasing a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger is a good idea.

All of the pictures were grainy and dark.  Takes great pictures outdoors, but indoors, it was terrible.  Since you can't adjust anything on this camera, there is nothing you can do but live with it.  The 'shutter speed' is slow.  It took forever to take the picture.  I exchanged this camera in 2 days.  Even after we used software to fix the pictures, they still looked bad.  (We bought an HP photosmart printer and the pictures looked bad.  It wasn't the printer, but the source:  THE CAMERA!)Granted I'm new to the digital camera world, but I would have expected this quality from a 1.X mega pixel camera.  Spend a little more money on an Olympus and get a camera you'll like.  The picture quality is not worth the price of this camera.  I wouldn't recomend this camera to the very novice buyer.

I needed a light-weight, point-and-shoot camera that I can take with me everywhere without bothering to carry a big case, lenses, films and all the other stuff. Having excellent experience with other HP products, I chose a HP and I never regreted that (I already took more than 9,000 (nine thousand) photos since I got it... and is still working! ;) )The pictures it takes don't even dream of being \"pro\" ones, but it has gorgeous colour tones (comparing to other cameras in this price range) and does great clear pictures in day-light (it is, after all, a ISO100 equivalent camera, so don't expect it to give you too sharp pictures for dark rooms, although the flash does help a bit. In darker areas, the pictures came out a bit grainy, and if it's really dark, they come out blueish - a thing that can be repaired in PhotoShop and... it's ok, as it's only doing the \"blue\" thing in very low light).I use the camera with an extra CompactFlash of 128MB (it can hold 138 pictures taken at maximum quality), and I use a pack of Kodak rechargeable batteries of 1800MAH which drain after about 150-170 high quality pictures. If you keep the window open too much of the time, the battery life may go down 20-30 pictures. I would say this is a great battery life for a digi cam! For those who cry that this camera is a battery drainer - try other cameras! :) Anyone who thinks of buying a digital camera should consider buying a recharger with batteries.Downloading: easy (through the HP software - just plug in the USB cord and off you go!), fast(!), and the HP printing software provided with the camera can help a beginner or the rushy person to quickly enhance the brightness and the tones of a photo taken in too lower light.Printing: I finally decided to print a couple of the photos I took woth my HP 612, and went to my photolab (Photo 1-2-3, Toronto) and the 4x6 pictures came out at the SAME quality as the ones on a ISO200 film taken with my SLR Canon EOS. This is great! Anyway, I don't think I would go bigger than 5x7, though it says on the camera that you can go up to 8x10 :)Should I say that my Hp deskjet 3820 gets the best of those pictures too?  :) I think HP will thank me for my review here, but it is true. :)If you are a beginner or you just need a camera to carry with you practically everywhere, this is the one: you've got quality, good colours, optical zoom, easy shooting, fast downloading, and all for the lowest price you can find!", "Date": "January 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great little camera with a nice price tag.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3B8TW4D5MWAM5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried several different cameras and I was very impressed with the output of the picture quality for a $200 camera. The software and USB interface make it easy for anyone to download the pictures from the camera. The quality is best, of course, on the best setting but I do recommend getting a memory upgrade. The only downfall is that it does not come with rechargeable batteries/charger although that is hardly worth counting against the camera since these reviews are for judging the camera's picture taking ability and ease of use rather than someone's lack of experience with digital cameras or how to shoot objects in the dark.
