I bought the camera for my older parents who needed a simple camera.  I was choosing between the Kodak M1033 and this camera, but decided to go with this camera because it is slightly easier to use.  Kodak describes the C series as a line of easy entry-level cameras, and that's definitely true.PROS:- Easy for first-time digital camera users- Large LCD screen- Large amount of megapixels- Many \"scene\" settings pre-programmed for different types of shots- Very low price- Compact size- Plug and play sharing via EasyShareCONS:- No viewfinder- M1033 has a couple extra features (i.e., panoramic stitching)- Uses AA batteries vs. charger (although this is mitigated by a good set of rechargeable batteriesBuy this camera if you're looking for an affordable, compact, easy to use camera.  It will meet the needs of most point-and-shoot users.  Do not buy this camera if you're looking to customize your shots beyond pre-programmed settings (i.e., adjustments in ISO, f-stop, shutter speed, etc.), but that should be self-evident, as this is a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Tremendous Bargain", "Author": "Mary J.

Yes, it's slim and lightweight. Yes, the shutter speed is snappy. But the photos are of such poor quality that it's a pretty useless camera.I bought this camera at Best Buy for $100 because my Olympus SP-320 is starting to act up (sometimes it won't turn on). During the first two days I owned the Kodak, I took nearly 100 photos in a variety of lighting conditions; none of them were keepers. A few looked okay when viewed on the computer at 25% size, but most were noticeably fuzzy. When viewed at 100%, all 97 photos are fuzzy; some of them even look like paintings rather than photos. Most of the photos had awful contrast, too.As a last test before returning the camera, I took the Kodak and my Olympus outside and two a set of identical photos with each (a park with lots of trees on a sunny day). The photos from the 7 megapixel Olympus were sharp even in the shadowed areas and the sky was a beautiful blue. The photos from the Kodak were noticeably fuzzy and the sky was nearly white.

I gave the Easyshare as a Valentine's Day gift for my fiance.  He (and I!) has had a lot of fun taking pictures using the different settings, which is my favorite part of the camera.  For example, \"up close\" is for extreme close ups without blurriness, \"sport\" for fast movement capture and \"backlight\" for backlit pictures.  The night settings are great, like \"extreme low light\", \"night landscape\", and \"night portrait\".  It even has individual settings for capturing fireworks, sunsets, sunny beaches and flowers.... interesting.Truth be told I've never owned a digital camera before, so I'm sure there are better quality cameras out there. But for our general use needs and for the price it's great. Its a decent size overall and the picture display is easy to see.The EasyShare software is simple to use to edit pics as well as make cards and other picture items.  I haven't tried the \"share\" function yet for uploading to youtube, but I'll try it when I've taken some video clips on the camera.Overall the Kodak EasyShare is a good general use camera with a nice amount of bells and whistles.

I took 10 pictures and a 10 second video and the batteries registered half used. So, I tried fully charged rechargeables and the same thing. Then, I tried a different brand of alkaline batteries, just went through the camera to adjust my preferences and the batteries were already showing at about a quarter used - I hadn't even taken a picture!The reason I purchased it in the first place was to take it with me on my trip to see my 18 month old grandson. It would be easy to transport and easy to tuck away in a pocket, keeping little hands off it. I have a Nikon SLR that I love, but it's not as practical for the at-the-moment shots and much larger to pack away. Had the Kodak had a different battery system, it would have been a keeper.So, I purchased the Fujifilm Finepix Z30. Same price range, but more features, smaller in size, takes beautiful pictures and has a rechargeable battery. Also, video playback has sound when played back on the camera - not so on the Kodak.I know there are tons of little cameras out there, and if you don't mind changing out batteries every time you use it, then this Kodak is for you.

Although it takes perfectly good pictures, it has two very major drawbacks (both of which I would have been warned about had I been more thorough).  First, it has no viewfinder through which to frame your photo -- the only image you have to work with is the one that appears on the LED screen.  The problem there is that in anything even remotely resembling full sunlight the LED screen is virtually unseeable.  So you are literally shooting blind much of the time.  Second, it doesn't have a rechargable battery...and the battery life isn't very long.  So you need to always carry a spare set of batteries around....just in case.

Put the Kodak Alkaline batteries in it that came with the camera, took about three pictures and the batteries were bad. We replaced the batteries with new Duracell Alkaline batteries, took a few more pictures and the new batteries were bad. Tried this a few more times in denial that a brand new Kodak camera would be bad.Contacted Kodak and was instructed to send the camera to their repair center in Conneticut and it could be repaired or be replaced with a refurbished one.  The repair service sent the camera back and it was just as bad as when I sent it.  The repair service told me it was because I used alkaline batteries and I should buy rechargeable batteries and a charger.  Why would Kodak send the camera with alkaline batteries if they didn't work?  Kodak's website indicated if you use alkaline batteries you should get between 30-70 pictures, and of course we got no where near that, maybe 5 at the most.  Even if the camera was not in use, it was draining the batteries.  It is obvious that the camera is drawing more current than the batteries can hold.  The repair center told me to basically live with the problem.  After indicating the world was going to come to an end for their reputation by way of the internet, they called back to say they would send me rechargeable batteries and a charger and if that didn't work, to call them back.  I most likely will be calling back.So I have paid for brand new batteries that lasted no more than five minutes to test the camera, UPS charges to return the camera and am no closer to solving the problem.Today I am going out to buy a Sony camera because I think my graddaughter has waited long enough for her Christmas gift.

Nonetheless, it is still very portable. light, is quick, takes very nice photos, and is intuitive. Digital cameras have come a long way and the fact there many 10MP cameras out well under $100 is awesome.  I have a Canon Rebel Xti and no a camera like this C180 will compare but I don't think any point and shoot will.  I have also owned 2 Canon point and shoots - both had the LCD die over time.  I also had a Nikon Coolpix, and it was way too slow which caused poor picture quality as well, hence soon sold it.  So these little Kodaks I think are well worth it when compared to the other major brands.  If you want a thinner camera, I suggest the M340, I would of paid the extra $15 for that.One odd but good thing, photos shot at full resolution 3664 x 2748 come in at only 1.6mb whereas my Canon Rebel (also 10mp) shoots 2592 x 3888 but each photo is much bigger = 3.8mb.The HD photos on this C180 are a misnomer.  They are actually wide angle, panoramic photos which can only be shot at 7.6 megapixels - which is fine but not what is advertised.It has video, but buy a video camera if you want to shoot videos.

Not that I hate shooting color because I don't.The problem is the more I read reviews, the more I'm questioning why so many of them gave this a 3 or 4 star rating when their reviews said it sucked. For ppl like me who just want to take a clear photo and will never end up being professional photographers, the 3 and 4 start reviews on a camera they think is crap is very confusing for those of us are searching and searching for a good one who look at these review stars and think it is when it's not.So if anything I just want to let ppl know that if you don't like your camera, please give it the 1 star review so more ppl know to avoid it.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "A.
