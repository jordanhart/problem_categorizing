{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Smart Camera for the Photography-Challenged", "Author": "Emily M. Lee \"Emily\"", "ReviewID": "R1N4T0RO0FNPE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a family member who wanted a camera that would be easy to use.  And boy is this easy to use!  This is by far the most intelligent camera I have ever used in terms of the accuracy of its Auto mode.  Just point and click, and the camera will select the appropriate settings every time.  No more blurred action shots, and no more washed out flash pictures where the entire background is just black.  This camera selects the appropriate ISO setting for each shot - in milliseconds.  Very short shutter lag, I would say unheard of for a point and shoot.  The touch screen is very intuitive and simple to use, and I like the absence of \"confusing\" dials of settings that most point and shoot cameras have.One feature I like is instead of having to choose the shooting mode (i.e. Portrait/Landscape/Night Scene/etc.) the camera automatically detects which shooting mode it should use, and switches to that mode - again, in milliseconds.  This is easily the most user-friendly camera I have ever come across, and my grandmother is already delighted with it.To be clear, this camera is not for a photography enthusiast, as you really have almost zero control over the settings.  This camera is fantastic for the demographic it was designed for: those who want to be able to push a button and capture the moment every time.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Top of the line - But!", "Author": "porback", "ReviewID": "R3SRO2I1O9ZU8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is no denying the fact that when it comes to Point and Shoot cameras, this one is at the top of the line.  That is,in quality, and extreme detail in the photos, which are absolutely beautiful!  So why four stars?  Because unless you are a mind reader of the engineers who designed this equipment, you will pull your hair out trying to figure out how to access the numerous modes and functions available that make the photos come out so great.  The literature that comes with it is not worth the effort in trying to decypher.  Even after downloading the full manual, I found the text would be an embarrassment to any tech pubs department.  My other problem with this camera is the touch screen controls, which are difficult to engage and require an inordinate amount of pressure to activate.  I found the use of the touch screen to be totally frustrating when trying to switch modes from one type of photography to another.  That, coupled with the \"hidden\" functions just became too much for me, so back it goes to be replaced by a more manual and therefore more useable Canon SX 40 Digital camera.  I would still recommend this camera to someone who is already knowledgeable in the use of upper class point and shoot cameras.  I realize that sounds like an oxymoron, but pointing and shooting can get downright complicated in the hands of a newbie like me.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "John Madura", "ReviewID": "R3MKJ8XQX834LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a small, quick , responsive camera that auto-focuses as fast as you can push the button. For those of you who need glasses to read - this is perfect - aim at the general area and click the button. - Alternately it has a nice array of optional settings that work real well.

In terms of size and picture quality this camera fit the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, I found the interface very difficult to use. While I am not an expert photographer, I do occasionally like to fiddle with the settings and when I got the camera it took me a full 5 minutes with the manual to figure out how to take a long exposure picture, since the settings shown on the screen didn't make any sense to me and didn't include any descriptive text.If you're looking for a small camera that takes nice pictures without changing any settings then this is the camera for you. I ultimately decided that I wanted a camera that with a more intuitive interface, and exchanged it for a Canon ELPH 310.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes awesome pictures", "Author": "K0rrupt", "ReviewID": "R12VMQ25FFU680", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Canon DigitalElph SD1000, until one day it wouldn't turn on again.I got this Panasonic Lumix because it got great reviews, and because my two 42\" Pansonic LCD TV's pictures are far better than any Samsung or LG... same with my two Panasonic Blu-Ray players as well.

Up to now I discovered the basic things and I'm quite satisfied with the results.  My only problem is the instruction manual that comes on a disc.  My computer does not have a disc reader and I wrote to Panasonic to have the e-version but they never answered me back. Search on line and didn't get any success eather.  Seems that I am on my own to find out all about it.

It is impossible to see the screen on a sunny day.  I mean -- IMPOSSIBLE.  You can't see your subject.Indoors you can see what is on the screen just fine.  Too bad the camera manufacturers are doing away with viewfinders for outdoor photography.  They should either have viewfinders or better screens.The other thing that is truly obnoxious is the fact that it has a proprietary cable connection.  Standard USB cables will NOT fit this camera.  I think devices that use non-standard interfaces should be boycotted at all costs.  We assumed it was a standard cable and should have checked before purchasing, but often it is hard to tell when it is boxed up in a plastic container or if you purchase it online as we did.Never again will we purchase a camera with a non-standard cable connector.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.95", "Features": "The DMC-FH27 features a newly developed 28mm wide-angle high quality LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens with powerful 8x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 28-224mm) into a slim, compact body\nThe 28mm wide-angle lens lets you easily capture large groups of people indoors or expansive architectural structures and scenes with dynamic width and rich perspective, even from short distances\nThe DMC-FH27 gives you smooth touch-control shooting.
