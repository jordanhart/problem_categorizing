{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little budget camera!", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "RNFYNOMXUDBSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very handy and easy to use.  Requires a micro SD card, but such are cheap and easy to get nowadays.  Be sure to set the resolution and quality level to the maximum according to the manual!  Anything less won't do!  Video mode works fairly well.  If you need a digital camera but are on a budget (I got it on sale), give this one a try!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprise for my grandaughter!", "Author": "Sharon R.

She was very surprised and thrilled with it.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awful quality", "Author": "Alana Jordan \"In Missouri\"", "ReviewID": "R1UVIRLNCQ1ICG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed a camera for eBay photos, so I chose this one since it was very affordable. I discovered I couldn't use it at all until I bought a memory card, so I spent another $20 on that. The quality of the photos is HORRIBLE and I can't use any of them. In my opinion, this camera is worthless - it wouldn't even be good enough for a child to tinker with. Save your money and pass over Bell & Howell.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "5.0MP resolution on still pictures VGA video resolution\n1.8 inch LCD screen, built in LED light\n4x digital zoom\nDirect upload to YouTube, includes image editing CD\nMicro SD compatible up to 16GB, 3 AAA batteries included", "Name": "Bell+Howell DC5-BL 5MP Digital Camera with 1.8-Inch LCD (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410fKnaMYZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DRG0AKY"}}
