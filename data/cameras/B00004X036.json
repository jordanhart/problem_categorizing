The fun, sweet little pictures are a hit, no matter who you show them to!  It's so quick and easy to grab a picture and bring a smile! :)  One thing I became aware of... a couple of times when trying to transfer the digital pictures to my computer, I got a \"No camera connected\" error.  In each case it was just that the plug wasn't all of the way plugged into the camera (it took me awhile to figure this out because it appeared to be plugged in well, but wasn't).  I was relieved to find that it wasn't a fault in the camera, because I was having so much fun with it!  The biggest drawback I find with this camera is that it seems to be made somewhat cheaply (though I haven't had time to either prove or disprove this impression).  For example, the battery compartment cover on mine doesn't fit really well, and made me that much more aware of the concern about breaking the plastic when closing the compartment. I don't think the plastic will be a problem as long as it's not rough handled.  I also found that, while a lot of instruction isn't so much necessary, I think the manual is lacking.  For example, I had no idea if I should pull out the film right after I made the exposure, or leave it in the camera (I don't have instant camera experience, yes, you can pull it right out) and all I found in the instruction manual about that after the camera's operation instruction was \"press the shutter button to take the picture\"  DUH!  (no, I'm not from Florida <j/k!> <grin>)...  I should also say that the \"troubleshooting\" part of the manual was very helpful!The quality of the pictures, both digital and instant, is good!  I just had to be sure not to get too close because the flash will blast out the image if it's less than... maybe 4 or 5 feet away.  So resist the temptation to get in close because the picture is so small on the instant shots.  The software that comes with it is a blast!  Lots of fun stuff to do with that!I like the camera A LOT and am so far VERY happy that I bought it!  This really is a positive review, I just wanted to give a very honest review of the product. I'd buy it again in an instant (no pun intended)!  It only comes with a 6 exposure non-sticky \"roll\" of film (but everything else you need), so you might want to get some extra of that right away.  ;)", "Date": "November 30, 2000"}, {"Title": "Will not work on computer with scanner or Palm software", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2XYNNI30N3E18", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If there is a hint (or even more) of frustration here....good!  Your computer, if you have any scanner or Palm software on it, will not recognize the camera and, therefore, you will not be able to download digital images to it.  This makes the digital feature of this camera totally useless.  Polaroid knows this problem exists (but isn't telling anyone unless they call their customer service department for help) and suggested I uninstall the scanning and Palm software and then reload the Polaroid software to solve the problem. Then I supposedly could relaod my scanner and Palm software and everything would be fine.  Two hours later...same problem.  With a dozen or so million Palms out there, and every one of them synced to a computer, and probably at least that many scanners in homes, and all of them tied to computers, it is hard for me to believe that Polaroid did not test their software against a computer configured with scanner or Palm software, if not both.  But, they apparently did not do so.  Accordingly, if you have Palm or scanner software on the computer to which you plan to download this camera's digital images....forget it!", "Date": "January 29, 2001"}, {"Title": "This is one AWESOME camera!", "Author": "Mama2Twins2008", "ReviewID": "R23EL74Z8294XG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a birthday present and I have loved it since I first took it out of the box!  It combines the best of both worlds...a fun instant polaroid and a digital camera all in one!  I started taking pictures the second I took it out of the box and haven't stopped for the past three weeks.  The polaroids are fun and if you ever want a bigger picture all you have to do is scan it and print it out on photo paper...the quality of the instant prints is EXCELLENT!  The pictures are clear, sharp and full of vibrant color!  The digital part of it has basic features, but still allows you to take great pictures that can be printed out on photo paper (and if they turn out a bit fuzzy any basic photo program will allow you to manipulate it and clear it up.)  This camera has come in handy quite a few times since I got it because if there's a picture you want to take really quickly, you don't have to waste time looking around for film.So far I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and I've used it every day for almost three weeks so far.  Contrary to what another reviewer said, the time that it takes for the digital pictures to download to the computer is just seconds!I would absolutely, DEFINITELY recommend this camera!  After seeing how awesome mine was, my boyfriend decided that he now wants one of his own!

The concept of the camera is awesome but the quality seems to be so-so. You have to be really careful of the lighting or the pictures come out too bright or too dark. We also had to make sure that the subject was far enough away (3-4 feet as someone else pointed out) and that there was no movement when the picture was snapped or it would turn out blurry.I like the camera and will probably use it for fun shots but will make sure to have a regular camera around for really important photos.", "Date": "December 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "Mellennia", "Author": "Rebecca A.

He loves the instant stickers and although we went through 3 packs of film the first day the kids all enjoyed it and the stickers can be used for a number of things.  The digital camera is excellent for beginners.  This is the first digital camera we have owned and it has worked well.  It is easy to use, the software is relatively simple and is fun.  Had a little trouble with the serial ports - which could have been more a problem with my computer than the camera - once I had my brother-in-law look at it he figured out the problem.  He did say a USB would have been better.  The quality of the pictures is good and you can adjust the quality through the software.  I have had as much fun as my son with this camera.  It only stores about 16 pictures in the memory and then you need to download them onto the computer and clear the camera so it wouldn't work well if you wanted to take alot of pictures on vacation and didn't have a computer handy!  I think for the price this camera is a really good deal and seems to be pretty sturdy.  My son has had it outside and all over and it hasn't broken yet!! I would recommend this for anyone with children who want to enter the world of digital photography!!  I will eventually buy a more advance digital camera for the family but this one will be great for the kids and definetly has been a good learning tool!!", "Date": "January 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "A fun toy at a much lower price.", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "R2VO5C10A49CIY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "... this limited capability hybrid is an affordable toy. It blends the popular I-zone Polaroid instant camera with a *very* basic digital camera. Well, it does neither task well, and no one is going to come to love this thing once the initial cuteness wears off. As an I-zone, a fun little camera that prints instant postage stamp photos (from pretty expensive Polaroid-only film), it's no longer way overpriced, though the film will keep setting you back. As a digital camera, it's way underfeatured. It lacks a zoom, an expandable memory, a decent resolution (it's not good enough to print even 5 x 7s), and, most woefully, a USB connection to download the few pics the onboard memory can handle. You may think that's no big deal, but it makes getting those pics onto your computer a slow, painful and battery-consuming process. If you want an I-zone, buy one; if you want a basic digital camera, look at Amazon's great collection (or the ones I've reviewed). If you're looking for a bargain on Christmas gifts, this just might fit the bill!", "Date": "September 5, 2001"}, {"Title": "Some Details About the Polaroid I-Zone Digital Combo Camera", "Author": "Robert A. Gilliam", "ReviewID": "R294V1JVJ2KA32", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Polaroid i-Zone combo digital camera is a 640x480 digital camera with one meg non-expandable memory, fixed focus lens, automatic flash, and no preview screen on the camera jammed onto a mini-polaroid i-Zone camera. It's big and awkward, which is probably why it hasn't been successful. I can never figure out how to grab it without putting a finger into a lens. I only bought it because I got an extreme bargain on it at my grocery store of all places. Overall I'm happy with it and will use it for my web site and to send photos by E-mail, but it's no replacement for a 35mm camera and a scanner.It's a TWAIN device so you can acquire photos directly from the camera with any TWAIN-supporting software, such as Paint Shop Pro. Photos are compressed as JPEGs inside the camera. It holds \"up to\" 18 shots, but unless you're taking photos of blank walls, it'll be more like 16. It takes about 2 minutes and 20 seconds to transfer a full load of photos from the camera through your PC's serial port. You can download the photos selectively, but you can't selectively delete. You can only clear the entire camera memory at once. The JPEGs are copied directly from the camera to a folder, so you don't have to worry about appropriate recompression unless you want to make modifications. The compression is a little too extreme. If you brighten with gamma correction, you can really see the JPEG squares.The flash doesn't go off unless it needs to, so you can get non-flash-lit pictures by providing enough light. The exposure isn't very well controlled. Indoor pictures at less than 2 feet are totally washed out by the flash, but that's easy to fix. Either light the subject better so the flash doesn't go off, or partially cover the flash. I used several layers of masking tape. The lens is so small that you can take pictures really close, like a few inches, and they'll only be a little blurry, but the flash must be totally covered with aluminum foil.It uses 4 AAA batteries and doesn't have a plug for a DC adaptor. I'll probably install one myself.It uses a 9 pin serial port, so if you have a serial mouse, you'll need a second port. Most computers have a second port, but it might be a 25 pin rather than 9. If so, you'll need a converter which will be about (dollar amount).It does not have a tripod mount or a timer, so you'll need help if you want to take pictures of yourself.It comes with a mosaic application which converts images to mosaics of other images. You'd think it would be fun to play with, but it lacks a simple browse option to select your own photos to use in making the mosaic. They don't let you use your own images because they want to sell you their supplemental image CDs. Of course they don't tell you this up front.

The camera is basically two cameras joined at the hip, which makes it very bulky.  The instant mini-photos are fun, especially with the sticker film, but the picture quality is abysmal unless the lighting is very good (i.e. outdoors).  It's almost impossible to get a good close-up shot unless you get right in someone's face, but I still like the concept, and it's very fun to use.As for the digital camera, it's about as basic as you can get (No zoom, no memory card, no USB) The picture quality is decent for e-mail use, but I haven't printed anything and wouldn't expect it to be very good. The colors come out true and fairly vivid for low resolution digital. One thing I like is that the camera responds instantly when you take the picture, so you don't miss the shot.

Have them all stored away and still send some along with emails ! And still taking more pictures. For the price as compaired to one costing hundreds, this isn't such a bad camera. I've also got a good digital \"only\" camera that takes 30 regular, 10 fine and 5 extra fine pictures. To me the Polaroid i-zone's picture quality isn't much different from the picture setting of 30 on my more expensive digital camera. I'm sure there's some i-zone camera's made that are duds, but lets face it, no matter what's made, there is always bad ones ! Just trade it back in for another !!!  Or put out the cash for a expensive one----but you'll find a bad apple among them also ???", "Date": "December 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "june myars", "ReviewID": "R3KD8CPHE7CDMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "awesome!takes good pictures with super-sticky film. the one problem I had with it was that it is not that portable.

REAL GOOD!So, I have to reconfigure the TWAIN driver every frickin' time I need to download from the camera.I purchased this camera as a fun, basic digital camera. I'm no novice at photography, and wanted to get a basic, decent camera to start with.Unfortunately, a decent product this is not.The digital photos are grainy, and the lens/viewfinder is misaligned so that the picture target is always missed.The instant mini photo feature seems to work adequately, though. I may keep this contraption just for that reason, but I swear- any trouble with the instant film option and I'm pitchin' this mofo right into the dumpster.  I'm so fed up with it!!Apparently you get what you pay for- I'm gettin' a Minolta Dimage 7 -a \"real\" digital camera.

A woman got in line and started passing around a \"review\" she had gotten online, saying this wasn't a real digital camera and that pictures would be horrible.  Several people left the line and when the store (called Tuesday Mornings) opened its doors, I watched this woman run into the store and grab up at least 8 of the cameras.  I only bought one, because the store had a very limited quantity and because what the woman said made me think I'd be wasting my money.  Since they were unbelievably cheap (...), I wasn't expecting much from the camera, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The pictures are not perfect, but they are certainly clear enough for sending in emails and printing.  It is a lot of fun as a first digital camera and takes much better pictures than another much higher priced polaroid digital I had purchased and returned because of terrible quality pictures.  I am sorry I didn't buy the 2nd one I had planned on and now cannot find this camera anywhere for less than twice the price I paid for it.  Locally (Kansas) it is regularly priced at 4 to 5 times the price I paid. If you want a fun camera that is easy to use, takes perfectly fine pictures for simple needs, and is affordable, this is the one.  The only negative I find about it is the ridiculous price of the \"sticker film\" to make postage stamp size pictures (remarkably clear for their tiny size).", "Date": "November 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "Stupidity from Polaroid", "Author": "SchmuckyTheCat \"schmuckythecat\"", "ReviewID": "R1FF0K8G9FC08L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a fun camera if you don't mind expensive mini prints.
