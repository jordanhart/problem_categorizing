Just a little thing though, the macro lens that goes on another lens, does not fit on top of the 50mm, which is slightly annoying.

If know anything about cameras and lenses look for a good deal on the body and buy the lenses separate.

The plethora of accessories that comes with the package including various lenses, filters, tripod, flashes, chargers, and more. The two lenses included are good for beginners. About the only thing I would have liked better is if I had a choice of a wide angle lens with the package instead of all the small lenses and filters.Shipping was prompt and customer service excellent.

Why did you send me 3 batteries and one of them do not fit the camera? Also, only the filters along with the macro wide lenses only match the 58mm telephoto lens. The regular 55mm has no filters nor am I able to attach the other two lens.

The two Canon lens are great. The extras, filters, lens extensions and such are a waste of packaging and I would have happier without them since now I have to make a place to store them until I throw them out.

And it is, really. But I don't need all that stuff, and the flash, the tripod and etc are not the best quality. I'm glad I chose the 50 mm prime lens and the long lens rather than getting the standard 18-135 mm kit lens that most of the kits come with, because it is easy to find a cheap used 18-135mm lens. That lens is really handy, but the 50 mm lens  and 75-300 lens is a better value. I was disappointed to realize that each of these lenses take different size filters. The \"macro\" and \"wide angle\" filters that come with this kit only fit the long lens. And the extra battery only works with the replacement charger - not with the Canon OEM charger.All in all, its a great deal, but not 'too good to be true'.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "LENS/FILTERS", "Author": "Beltecezar G.", "ReviewID": "R94W5FWBXN2R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera is great but the filters and the Vivitar lenses in the bundle DOES NOT fit!

This package comes with plenty of stuff to make this a great deal, but I think the camera body and lenses alone are worth it. My one complaint is that the macro and wide angle lenses aren't actually lenses. They are add-ons that you would screw onto your existing lens. HOWEVER, these lenses don't fit on the 50mm. It's kind of pointless to have a macro lens on the telephoto lens, but it does fit. The macro and wide angle lens each had a piece of paper with them that said that to find compatible parts, contact the company. I e-mailed the company and they were incredibly rude about it and as of yet I still have not found adapters or anything to make the macro and wide angle lens work with my beloved 50mm.Additionally, the camera bag isn't very nice. I already own a very nice camera bag and so the one that comes with this set will just be for the random stuff I need to store at home. I will probably never take it out of the house. The tripod isn't the best quality, either, but I already had a really nice tripod, too, so I wasn't too upset about that.Even though there were some bummers about this kit, I'm so completely happy with it. The 70D is amazing and takes excellent quality pictures. I upgraded from a T3i to the 70D and have not looked back. The 70D has wifi and a (huge!) touch screen. This is such a great deal and I am so happy with my purchase.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP dual pixel CMOS digital SLR camera body\nCanon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III telephoto zoom lens\nCanon EF 50mm f/1.8 II SLR lens brand new\nTwo LP-E8 rechargeable lithium ion replacement battery + external rapid quick-charger and car charger", "Name": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP Dual Pixel CMOS Digital SLR Camera + EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens + Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II SLR Lens + Two LP-E6 Replacement Lithium Ion Battery + External Rapid Charger + 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card + 58mm Wide Angle Lens + 58mm 2x Telephoto Lens + 58mm 3 Piece Filter Kit + 58mm Macro Close Up Kit + Mini HDMI Cable + Carrying Case + Full Size Tripod + Multi Card USB Reader + Memory Card Wallet + Deluxe Starter Kit DavisMAX Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512yvg5HMuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EPOJDNM"}}
