We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian \"ger\" (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.", "Date": "November 23, 1999"}, {"Title": "Truly a great little camera, especially for the price", "Author": "\"jeugenides\"", "ReviewID": "R28RQHJKHM2A2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If it had an optical zoom lens, this camera would be perfect! But, it would also cost a lot more. The  camera is nice and small, fits easily in a coat pocket so you can take it  anywhere. Picture quality is great, a bit soft on landscapes but all  digital cameras are, even the 2 megapixel ones don't really do landscapes  that well. The macro shots from this camera look spectacular, and people  shots are just great. They print out very nicely, too. The autofocus works  very well, and the metering is excellent (you can adjust the exposure up  and down 1 stop if you want, but so far I haven't found it necessary).  Color saturation is great, and very accurate. You can't adjust the white  balance manually, but fortunately the camera's automatic white balancing  works extremely well. You have 4 options when taking pictures, SQ (standard  quality), HQ (high quality), SHQ (super high quality) and SHQ uncompressed.  SQ is 640x480, the rest are 1260x980, the only difference being the  compression used. HQ uses the most compression, and SHQ uncompressed uses  no compression at all (a nice feature that many cameras don't have -for  those really detailed shots). I find HQ works just fine for most pictures,  and I can get 73 of those on a 16MB card. The viewfinder is a bit small,  but not hard to find, and it's quite clear. The LCD is good, even in the  daylight. Controls are easy to learn and well laid out. It's easy to view  your pictures on the LCD, and you can delete any one (or all of them) at  the touch of a button. You can also protect any of them from being  accidentally erased. There's a 3x feature that allows you to see a portion  of the picture a 3 times the size, useful for determining how sharp it  really is, or if you moved the cameral during the shot. The flash works  very well for its size, and you can easily turn it off, set it for fill, or  red-eye reduction. The panorama mode works great, even hand-held. I took  some shots of a church with the steeple way, way up there, using the  panorama feature, and when I assembled the shots later on the computer  (it's an automatic process) the result was tremedous. You could not see the  seams at all, even though I took the shots hand-held. Great stuff. The  camera is pretty sturdy too. I dropped it from about 3 feet and  (thankfully) it survived. The software is reasonably good, and I really  like the little Camedia thumbnail viewer. Downloading from the camera is  smooth, although a bit slow since it's serial. However, the FlashPath  adapter works really nicely and is much, much faster. The camera uses batteries pretty quickly,  but if you get some NIMH rechargeables you'll have no worries. Go to Thomas  Distributors on the web, and buy the MAHA MHC-C204F charger  and  8 NIMH batteries and you'll never run out. With the MAHA you can even recharge them in your car. Don't buy the Olympus NIMH charger, it only works with Olympus batteries (yes I tried it with some others and it  got so hot it almost caught fire) and doesn't have the features of the MAHA  (and it costs quite a bit more).  By the way, the camera comes with a  home version of PhotoDeluxe, which is an OK photo editor. Has the basics.  But you'll probably want something else eventually. I recommend PhotoSuite  II - really great for the price and very easy to use.  Anyway, I guess  I've rambled a bit, but bottom line I'm very happy with this camera. Going  digital is so freeing - you can take as many shots as you want, no film  costs, see exactly what you have before you walk away, and then put it all  into your computer to play with.", "Date": "October 29, 1999"}, {"Title": "good camera, but it costs more than you think...", "Author": "\"superstar_kennyd\"", "ReviewID": "R34XX9OGNJ8Z6T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and my very first camera forover $200. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.", "Date": "November 29, 1999"}, {"Title": "Best buy at this price for everyone who wants a digital cam!", "Author": "J.

Do what I did and check the reviews.  Amazon's is slightly off mark. Most rank the D340R at the top of the \"Under $300.00\" class.  1280X960 TRUE megapixel resolution is hard to beat at $250.00 (what I paid) and the quality is just what others  have said....1st rate!Unlike Amazon's review, it IS a battery miser,  second only to the HP C30 (1000 photos).  The full motion LCD screen is the  only credible drain and not using it will give you well over 700 shots on a  set of AA's.My camera came with an 8mb card.  Amazon is incorrect in  stating 8megs give you only 60 standard quality photos.  It's 122 640x480  pictures.  If you plan on doing a lot of picture posting or emailing,  640x480 size pictures don't overwhelm the servers out there.  You get 36 HQ  pictures (1280x960)...4x the file size of a standard quality pic.  18 SHQ  pictures (1280x960 but with superb crispness and detail) fit on the card.  What am I saying?  You won't need to buy a spare card if you can hook up to  the computer every few days or weekly at the most.  I'll buy a couple extra  cards for any long road trip!A final comment on downloading.  Serial  cable connections are inherently slower than USB hookups.  However, the  Olympus D-340R's download time through it's serial connection is remarkably  fast...a lot faster than HP's and Fuji's....about 5-7 secs per 640x480 pic.I hope this helps.  This camera truly is fantastic and I've become both  a website buff and amateur photographer as a result.

People that have problems with battery life are obviously keeping the LCD screen on alot.  If you turn it on to take a picture, review it, then shut it off till you get to the next picture, it will last  for days on hi-capacity Ni-Hi rechargable batteries.  In my opinion, DON'T  buy the AC adapter.  If you are using hi-capacity rechargables, you will  not kill the battery life by downloading pics into your computer.  Once  they are downloaded, turn the camera off.  People make the mistake of  editing their pictures on their computer and the camera is still left on.  Referring to only downloading one picture at  a time - use the software available from the Olympus website.  The software  that comes with the camera is junk.  Their new software gives you more  simplicity and control over what you download into your computer.  In my  opinion, this is the best camera around for the price.

The ONLY downside is that it does use up batteries quite a bit so I've got  an AC adapter for mine for when I use it indoors. Also when the camera malfunctioned (my fault, water got  spilled on it) Olympus fixed it for free under warranty and had it back to  me within two weeks working perfectly again.

Contrary to many reviews, the camera DOES NOT eat batteries too quickly; I  used it heavily for days before the meter showed any drain.  The desirable  missing feature is an optical zoom, but you can't expect one at this price.  (Those of you not living on a college student's budget may want to post  the extra $, though!)

I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV.

Here are some things that missed the mark.  The manual is a human factors disaster.  The print is tiny, the table of contents is on about page 30, if  you can find it and they used that confounded \"all four languages on  each page\" format instead of four separate sections with black blocks  at the edge to make each section easy to find.  The software had a few  problems.  There was a little utility that appears to be a general camera  interface for Windows.  When I tried to set it up, I found that it listed a  wide variety of cameras but the D-340R wasn't among them!  It also came  with Adobe Photo Delux.  I've heard a lot of raves about this and other  Adobe products.  They were all from people who'd never tried competing  products. In other words, the software will do a lot, but as with the  manual, the human factors are terrible. They don't even follow the  \"Save As\" convention to output different file formats. With  Adobe, you use the old \"export\" convention.  I also found that  some of the JPEG's output by Photo Deluxe could no longer be read by the  other viewing software that comes with the camera.  I recommend you find  people who have other cameras and look at their photo processing software  to find a more user friendly program. Finally, the manual frequently  recommends using the AC adapter for some common operations.  Well, if its  the best way to go, why is does it not come with the camera?  You may as  well buy one when you order the camera.  As for the camera, its fairly easy  to use, but not before you've read the manual which isn't easy to use.  Once you've done that, the pictographs make sense and the frequent user  shouldn't have to consult the manual again.  A little more effort at user  friendliness here would obviate the need for a manual for most  operations.Does all this mean you shouldn't buy the D-340R? No.  If the  hardware turns out to be reliable, its price performance combination is  hard to beat, and the difficulties are all surmountable.  They just make it  an target for the competition.

At $400 in early 2000 (everything electronic has is relative to date), it may represent the  best value going.The pictures are great (don't rely on the autoflash  indoors...for indoor shots, set the camera for flash).  The operating  manual could be more user-friendly, but is tolerable.  Once you get the  hang of it, it's a very easy camera to operate.  The built-in shutter  cover, which doubles as the power shutoff is an example of simple  engineering genius.On the downside, you'll read that the 340R is a  \"battery hog,\" and it is.  Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride  batteries (get 8 + a charger) are a must.  I also recommend the FlashPath  adapter.  It's a great way to transfer your picture files to your computer  and saves on battery usage.Though I LOVE Amazon, the truth is that  you'll be better served if you buy generic versions of these accessories,  rather than the Olympus versions that Amazon sells.Another battery  saving technique is to avoid using the built-in mini-monitor to take  pictures.

I  haven't done that, so I'm sure those are 2 main reasons the batteries are  already low.Also, it is suggested that you use the LCD screen for  viewing pictures only, as not only does it eat up battery life but you can  take more steady pictures when using the viewer rather than the  LCD.Camera --> PC transfers are slow and you can get quite impatient  waiting for the included software to index/thumbnail all the pics on the  cam before you can do anything such as download, etc.But, for the price  it's an excellent camera.

The adjustment allows you to take photos in low  pixels so the saved photos won't eat up all the space on your computer or camera card.**A note of caution, the smart cards with 4-8 mpixels that fit this camera are very difficult to find now days and expensive to boot.I think it won't take over a 16mp card.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent 1st timer", "Author": "Norman", "ReviewID": "R26Q920GJN7IPP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent for 1st time users I have had my D-340R for 4 years, have found that you need to spend alittle more money and get a dig.card reader (if that's what you call it) It takes no time to up load pictures onto my PC with it.

I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.

It would be nice if the camera had more of a zoom feature, but that's probably its only shortcoming.Best results come with the HQ mode. You can save up to 36  pix on 8MB card in the HQ mode. The SHQ mode provides less JPG compression  and a truer image, but the tradeoff is that you can only save 18 images on  an 8 MB card. I haven't noticed any real improvement with the SHQ mode and  -- in my opinion -- the pictures actually look more pixelated in the SHQ  than in the HQ. The JPG compression of the HQ mode smooths the gradients a  bit more, it seems. So HQ mode it is for me on almost every shot. The LQ  mode is only 640x480, and the image quality deteriorates rapidly if you try  to do any zooming or cropping on LQ pictures.I print my photos on an  Epson Stylus Photo 750 printer. In most cases, the output looks to the eye  to be genuine photo quality. As mentioned above, if you try to do blow up  pictures too much -- especially in LQ mode -- the image quality  deteriorates visibly.Battery life has not been a problem for me, but I  use the LCD display as little as possible. I only use it to review pictures  already taken, not to frame or compose shots. I use the viewfinder to  compose. You get a little more in the picture than what you actually see in  the viewfinder, so it's not likely that you'll cut someone's head off in  the picture.I download pictures using the serial cable (included).  Download is rather slow, and it takes several minutes to dump an entire  full camera's worth into the computer. I haven't figured out if there's a  way to select just a few thumbnails off the camera and not download the  whole set of thumbnails. Once you have the thumnails downloaded, though,  you can select only those you want to download for real.The manual is  straightforward and easily understandible, and all the camera controls make  sense once you're up on them. You probably would have a tough time figuring  them out without consulting the manual, though.I hope this is helpful.

The first problem about this camera is that it has no zoom.  i cant stand a camera without zoom.  that might be enough to throw it in the trash right off the bat.  But theres more!  This camera eats batteries like crazy.  That is to say you put batteries in, take pictures for 2 minutes, and then it says the batteries are dead and wont let you take any more pictures.  If you take the batteries out, you can use them in another device for hours, but the camera says they are dead.  This seems to happen with only non-rechargeable batteries though, but still, thats another 10, 20$ you have to spend on rechargeable batteries and a charger, plus it takes 4 AA's when it should only take 2.  The camera is also very cheap.  The whole thing is made out of the lowest grade plastics i have ever seen.  If i ever dropped it i am sure it would break.  When you turn the camera on, the display on the back doesnt go on like it should.  The shutter button is often reluctant to snap a photo.  These features make it very hard for me to teach my not-too-savvy family how to use this camera.  The flash also makes pictures come out terrible for some reason, and i always find myself shutting it off to save the photo.  Not that the photos look anything better than terrible without it.  This is a 1.3 MP camera, and a terrible one at that after all.  Now we come to the worst feature, the software.  This is the most poorly designed software anybody could make.  Only a monkey could design software that was any less quality.  First off, IT USES A SERIAL PORT!  That might have been the height of technology in 1985, but anything less than USB is INEXCUSIBLE!  This software is very picky and choosy about when it wants to see that your camera is connected to the computer.  And it takes about 30 seconds to detect if it is.  Then it takes forever to download just a thumbnail of all the images on the camera.  And if you try to transfer more than oh, say, 5 pictures at a time, you risk having the software close on you.  Now this might happen before you wait the 10 hrs it takes to transfer the pictures over the rediculously slow serial port, or after.  I have it happen to me often after the pictures have supposedly transfered, but then the pictures are nowhere to be found on the hard drive, and i have to spend the 30 min re-transferring them.  The people at olympus are obviously not your friends, because i wouldnt wish this digital camera on my enemies.  NEVER BUY THIS CAMERA.  But if you do, spend the extra 20$ to get a smartmedia USB card reader.  It will save you the agony of using the Serial port and the Camedia software, which are both horrible.  Also buy rechargeable batteries, as from what ive seen, all olympuses like to eat batteries like theres no tommorow.  I would just like to emphasize again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY IT, ACCEPT IT AS A GIFT, ANYTHING.  If this camera was free i wouldnt take it. Well i might just to stomp on it 30 times and break it just to save anyone the agony of having to use it.", "Date": "January 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excelente Camara", "Author": "Luis Fernando Hurtado", "ReviewID": "RAMHG8EFR3VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compr\u00e9 esta camara y estoy fascinado, me parece una excelente compra, obtuve la mejor relaci\u00f3n beneficio/precio, aunque definivamente le faltan mas funciones en su patalla LCD, la opci\u00f3n de panoramico me parecio  excelente, ayudado obviamente por el software que viene con la camara.
