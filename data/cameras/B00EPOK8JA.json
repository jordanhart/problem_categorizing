Its not fancy but it sure does the job both close up and farther shots.  the Tripod is small and nice for my table top photos.  I got it at an insanely low price.  double reduced  so I couldn't pass it up.  Not sure why but mine came with 2 batteries, 2 tripods and 2 memory cards.  One set was \"in the camera box\" and the other was outside the camera box..  Anyway great deal.
