{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera for the price! Grab one right away!", "Author": "Vikas", "ReviewID": "R2ZKXQEKHNNWXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera recently, as a backup camera to use when I don't feel like lugging around my D-SLR. I am amazed by its performance. For such small size, it delivers tremendously.Pros:- I picked up the red one. I like that it comes in different colors.- It is so small and compact that it can fit comfortably and snugly even in the smallest of pockets. I can take it to any place where I want to hang out and cannot carry my D-SLR. It is just like a cellphone.- Amazing and crisp 16MP picture quality. Smart mode works pretty well recognizing scenes. More so, the numerous scene modes work beautifully. It also has excellent wide angle coverage for landscapes. I am not much of a 'zoom' or 'crop' person, so 5X zoom is pretty neat for me.- 720p video shoots some very nice quality videos.- Lot of fun effects in both camera and video modes that you can explore and enjoy.- Love the panorama mode.- Battery lasts long enough for an occasion or a day out. I have not counted the shots on a single charge, however I have never run out of battery before I returned home.- makes an excellent camera for beginners. Very intuitive and has help messages to work your way around different functions.Cons:- None so far. I am loving it.This is an amazing performer and a beautiful looking camera and it is hard to find a camera with similar specs around the same price point. I would suggest to grab one while the deal lasts.

The pictures were blurred no matter how still I held it; the shutter speed was extremely slow.Don't worry the camera is great. The factory pre-set is a slow shutter speed with a long processing to finish the photo. Just go into the camera's menu and set the auto function if you expect to use it in the standard aim and fire way. The pictures are acutally pretty nice.  Plus the small size makes it easy to carry.*You need a MICRO SD memory card for this camera*", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good for the Value", "Author": "J.

It's easy to use, doesn't take up much room in your pocket, and takes very good photos.  I looked up spare batteries on Amazon and found them relatively cheap.

It has a lot of features for just a begginer like me, is compact and the zoom feature really impressed me, because it still has very good quality in maximal zoom. In a occasion i was aiming for take a pic at maximum zoom , and the image looked so poor, but when i took the picture and saw the pic taken it looked in a too good quality.Overall the camera enhance the quality and appearance of pics(mainly the people skin).I bought it in Target but im sure from Amazon is evenly good.

Not a slight chance to ship it back to seller as it arrived shortly before my scheduled international flight.  Intentionally bought it for the specific travel but in only less than a week of minimal use and it's already malfunctioning!!!  All pictures were so disappointingly blurry since day one!!!  Shutter button got stuck during a family reunion...grrrrr!!!  Definitely unacceptable!!!!!  Wish I could get my money back but ran out of time to do so.  Extremely mad, sad, regretful, frustrated, & entirely dissatisfied!!!

That is where the troubles began.I called Samsung for warranty repair and went through all their prompts for digital cameras but got sent to the Blue-ray department every time. I then had to get transferred to the camera department.I called 5 times but every single time the Samsung operator hung up on me. Five times is no \"accident\". The fifth, and last, time I asked to speak with a manager. That made no difference. He put me on hold for 20 minutes and then hung up on me.So I was forced to write to Consumer Affairs in New Jersey. Almost 2 month later, Samsung finally accepted me returning the camera for warranty repair, But they did not fix it. Instead they sent back a new battery and charging cord. The camera still does not take a charge.All this for an $80 camera. Might as well have thrown it in the trash when it stopped working. Or better yet never bought a Samsung product in the first place. I was looking into their netbooks but after this experience, I will never buy anything from Samsung again.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Misleading color", "Author": "CoffinSupply \"CoffinSupply\"", "ReviewID": "RM20Z9VQYIQ2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes grainy pictures no matter how still I hold it.
