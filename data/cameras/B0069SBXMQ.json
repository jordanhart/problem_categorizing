I was quite impressed being that I was coming off a typical point and shoot camera from Nikon. Coming from where I stand Ineed a camera that takes better still photos. im tired of the blurry shots I was getting from my old camera. It is true if you are taking pictures of something moving it will come out blurry...but there is a sports mode that takes clear shots of moving objects. Most camera's need alittle play time to get used to and reading the directions is helpful but straight out of the box this thing is self explainatory. I will give it 4 stars for the price I paid 99.99 and the fact that its a step up from my old and the zoom is unbelievable. And less the 5th star because the blurry thing. I'll have to remember to put it in that mode if the person or thing im shooting is moving. I did not want to spend 200 or more on a camera to get good shots for the holidays.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hold on before you return it. . . .", "Author": "David K. Miller", "ReviewID": "R2JHWLB3J08D83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up at Target on 12/24/11 ($99).  I'm still shopping for a better (and more expensive) camera, but the 15X zoom on this caught my attention.  I figured if the negative reviews were true I could still use it as a birding camera and just keep it in the car.I took about 100 shots last night in and outdoors, and another 100 today (in and out, sunny).  I'll admit I was ready to take it back after the first 50 because the auto settings produced too much blur.  Then I read the ENTIRE manual and tried some settings other than the defaults.  Based on my limited tests, here are some adjustments that will make you feel much better about the camera:*ISO is manually adjustable all the way up to 6400.  I'm getting decent low-light indoor shots at 800 without excessive noise.*Use the \"slow sync\" flash mode.  It illuminates with less glare in some situations but still provides enough light to freeze the action.*There are TWO types of Vibration Reduction (VR).  The normal mode works very well with the zoom at full extension and is the VR that's automatically set for most of the shooting modes.  But there is a 'hybrid' VR setting that snaps the shutter twice (at ISOs of 200 and below) and compares the images.  Processing time and saving is a bit longer but I was able to take indoor pictures (without flash) of my dogs moving around and get clear images.*The \"exposure compensation\" control appears to adjust the shutter speed within a limited range depending on the initial shooting mode that's selected.  If the flash is washing out your shots this control can damp that down some.*Try to pre-focus on 'sports' shots by holding the shutter halfway down on the spot where you anticipate capturing the movement. Finish the shot when the subject is in the center of the frame.  It's tricky but can yield some surprisingly good results.Notes: The f/stop setting is controlled by the level of zoom magnification.  (I haven't found a way to override that setting.)  All of the settings are displayed on the LCD when you push the shutter button halfway down so it's pretty easy to keep track of what works best - I'm generally setting the ISO higher and exposure compensation lower than the defaults suggest.  And, the performance of the zoom at full magnification with VR is really quite impressive.Bottom line:  This is a pretty decent camera and IMHO worth the price, if not more, for the Nikkor lens alone.  You do need to spend a little time getting acquainted but the results are worth the effort.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spoiled Much?", "Author": "iBelieb!", "ReviewID": "R31WFW25OTNRP5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am amazed at some of the reviews on here regarding the Nikon L105/110.  Reminder: This is an entry level, point and shoot digital camera boasting 12.1 MP.

The zoom is fantastic and the pictures come out so clear, I love how light it is, and I just love how the pics come out!  The ONLY thing I don't like is the 3\" LCD screen.  It's great and all, but with pics of people from far away (with scenery in the back), the people's faces look blurry, but when I zoom in to the pic, it's actually fine.

At first I didn't think it worked very well and these reviews made me very nervous. After playing around with it for about a week and bringing it to my cousins wedding I am in love. This camera is great and maybe 5 out of the 80 pictures I took came out blurry. The key is to put it on an auto mode and it chooses which mode is best. I took many picture of the bride, groom, and guests dancing and they all came out completely clear. I have a sony camera that cost me $300 and I can ONLY take pictures where people are moving in a sports mode and the pictures were always too dark. This Nikon is amazing for $100 and I don't understand what these other people were expecting when they bought it...after all it's NOT a DSLR.  I must warn you that on the screen the picture LOOKS blurry, but when you zoom into it or put it on your computer the pictures are totally clear, so don't worry about that. Definitely worth it just take the time to play around with is and use the manual CD they give you it has a lot of good advice. Enjoy!

I have a Panasonic Lumix that cost me $250 and this camera takes way better pictures in low light than that camera! I was even taking pictures outside at night and they came out so clear and bright!

I was pleasantly surprised with how well the menu's work. Rather than a dial on top of the camera to select shooting modes, it has a button on the back. You don't have to take your eyes off the view finder to change modes. Another great feature is the button that lets you start shooting video without taking your eyes off the back of the camera, again a seamless transition from video to still shots. The image stabilization works great, I can hand hold a 15X zoom pictures and get good results 3 out of 4 times. With a monopod or tripod it would be great. It seems to give good results in low light conditions. I have a lot of digital cameras. This is my new favorite. You need to take the time to learn how to use it. It has a lot of capabilities. If you do your part this camera will do it's part. It is most probably a much better camera than the average user is a photographer. Push down the button and let it focus. I love it.

I bought this after reading that it is a good entry-level \"bridge\" camera for inbetweeners - and I was not steered wrong! This camera has excellent picture quality and a variety of great options, I absolutely love playing with it.This is not a simple point and shoot camera, it is definitely a bridge, and can take some getting used to. If your pictures are \"noisy\" (i.e. grainy) reduce the ISO by simply going to the Menu and selecting an ISO sensitivity. If the shutter speed is too slow, stop taking pictures in darker settings. If the flash is washing everything out, turn it off, or play around with the different scenes, and if you want motion pictures, utilize the sports mode that will give you non blurry shots. Since I've had it, I've had one blurry shot because I made it that way.As for the battery operation, I prefer it (although I might be the only 24 year old that does), but instead of forgetting a battery charger on vacation and being SOL, I can just run to the nearest store and pick up a four pack of AA's - it's not like it takes a specialty 50$ battery or something.Overall, if you take the time to get to know the camera it is absolutely, positively worth every penny. Be sure to check out a local target and ask if they have the L105 in stock, my Target did not have it out on display, it was tucked under the display case.

Jordan \"Voracious Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1AHR48F1P7LAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is much smaller than it looks in the photos online, the menus are harder to access and figure out, and it does NOT come with ANY photo editing software! What does come on CD with it is a photo viewer, a panorama pic program and a user manual on disk only (quick start guide is very limited). The website for uploading Nikon images to does NOT have photo editing capabilities, I couldn't even find a place to add tags to images, though ratings and labels are easy to find. I'll stick with Flickr. My 1st test images lacked color, were either washed out of over-saturated yellow, many were fuzzy & low quality even with flash. I was using the \"Easy Auto\" default, but when I switched it to regular \"Auto\" mode, the colors were more realistic, there is a full menu there for white balance and other settings, though it is not at all intuitive in getting to those menus.The best things are that it is the easiest camera to use right out of the box, without reading the user manual. One just inserts 4 AA batteries, turns it on and waalaa. The zoom is extremely powerful & fast! It beats my pro DSLR camera in speed and telephoto capability. The built-in memory is perfect to start off with, but one will want a memory card for more capacity, though it took over 50 pics at 6 MP setting with no problem using camera memory without memory card installed. The flash is manual pull up, push down, and I don't see an easy way to access settings unless one chooses one of the program modes and edits through there, missing the shot if it's unexpected while figuring out and setting it up for the shot. The continuous shooting feature is incredible, I was able to make 3 GIFs of the resulting images immediately, didn't know what else to do with 40+ shots of my cat licking his lips. I wasn't aware it was shooting multiple images, I hit the shutter button accidentally and it was only in reviewing a later image that I found the 40+ images it shot silently from one button push! The quality was therefore extremely bad, since I had flash off and no tripod at the time. I look forward to experimenting with that feature while aware I'm doing so! However, the images of action come out clear, like stop-action photography. I'm not sure how one would do blurred water/moving images, as opposed to freeze frame, but being able to quickly capture an action image in excellent quality, sold.The video is very easy to use though there is no lighting settings as there are on digital camcorders (low light, daylight, bulb, etc) but there are scene modes that handle those situations, am just not sure the flash adjustments apply since one cannot use flash with video on the Nikon. I'll be testing the sound & low lighting tomorrow night filming a live band, and will update with the results then.One of my favorite aspects of this camera are the easily accessible features right on the rear navigation buttons--macro, self-timer, flash and EV adjustments, all one touch access without scrolling through menus to find. The Delete button, review button (for seeing images previously taken, then easily deleting while viewing, or protecting from deletion), menu and video buttons are all on the rear panel. The zoom is left/right slide on the top right of the camera. The battery compartment has space for one memory card.Least fave aspects: this camera requires the lens cap be off to access any menus or setup scenes in advance, as well as to review images to delete them. Since the camera will not take accessory lenses or filters (such as ones to protect the lens), this makes the lens easy to damage and smudge. In fact, when I tried a close up on my cat, his nose smudged the lens numerous times as well as condensation from his breathing on it (he explored it while I shot, I did not put it on his nose :) Lastly, the size of the camera is much much smaller than expected. The lens and LCD screens looked huge to me in all advertisements and the included product info, but in reality they are small, with little weight to the camera & a thinner plastic body than I am used to.All in all, I would recommend this camera to most budding photographers, a portable option when watching sports and action events, or for those like me, who have extensive DSLR cameras who need an inexpensive & quick option for video AND high quality photos when lugging all the other gear out isn't needed for the situation. My goal was to find good quality video and camera in one unit, and I have tried many products (mostly camcorders that promised great photos too & failed) & been disappointed, until now. If it can handle the loud bands I film, it might even become a favorite, but if not, I have a special camcorder that will.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK for beginners, I was not impressed.", "Author": "Stephanie Kendall \"Kendall Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R8G4FSEN71R7Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice camera for a beginner, but no way compares to the Nikon Coolpix P520.

I've always had positive experiences with Target so I really don't have any issues with this.The Nikon L105 is great entry level super-zoom camera.  It offer more features and higher optical quality than most point and shoots without the large price tag typically fount on super-zoom cameras like the P500 (~ $300).  It takes phenomenal pictures outside and its \"easy\" mode will automatically pick whatever settings it thinks are right for the environment.  If you don't like it's choices its very easy to change.  I did find that pictures taken indoors tended to be less crisp than those taken outside and the camera has a tendency to really pick up the \"yellow\" given off by an entirely light-bulb lit room.  It does use 4 AA batteries, and initially this bummed me out a little, but I have yet to go through them; so it seems to have decent battery efficiency. I'd like to emphasize again that the L105 is intended as an entry level camera; if you are someone that's used to lugging around 10 lbs of SLR gear this camera is not for you and, frankly, it wasn't made to be.Bottom Line: Wonderful product for the price and a great camera for people who would like better pictures than what a point and shoot can offer without having to pay $400.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Tabata", "ReviewID": "R2FYFMW8YTIDER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera because for someone like me does not have any skill in photography this camera  is excellent choice.

Took it home and proceeded to test the heck out of it. Took 125 pictures, indoor and outdoor, with many of the various presets and defaults changed for really investigating what this camera could do.End result: I almost immediately got back in my car, and returned the camera to Target.Out of all those pictures, only about maybe 10% were of borderline acceptable quality. Most were grainy, blurry or washed out/lacking in color. There was significant noise in ALL the images, such that even some untrained eyes I put on the images said the same thing. Many were over/underexposed, bleached by flash, or just bad. Also, I noted that even if I occasionally got the image in focus, the edges of the image were still blurry. Worse yet, the shutter was usually slow, meaning you'll never get good shots of kids or pets, or anything with any movement for that matter.Sometimes, it is acceptable if you can fiddle your way to a good image. This is after all a \"bridge\" camera between the just-aim-and-press crowd and the SLR crowd. However, even here we failed. This camera lacked good manual control. Sometimes, some control was granted in some of the preset modes, but all in all, it was just a bad user interface.Other minor nits: uses AA batteries, and you apparently should not use rechargeable per manual.Most telling is that a search for the L105 at Nikon USA's website returns nothing.I wanted a good camera with more zoom and better optics than the average diminutive point-and-shoot to take pictures of my daughters at events where 5x zoom isn't quite enough.

OTOH, you already have the camera and like it mucho, skip reading this review, you have made the perfect decision, enjoy it!Bought it on BF sale from Target for $99. A day later, having shot about 50 pictures, I decided to return it for the following reasons:1. Flash used indoors invariably over-exposed the subject, while the same shots came out much nicer without flash. The flash is not auto, I had to pop it open manually.2. Moving subject resulted in blurry picture - and I am talking about my kid on his bicycle, not a high-speed projectile!3. When the object is too close, the camera provides a \"not in focus\" warning, but the lens motor keeps trying to focus and you can hear it. Why does it simply not stop? Poor design choice!4. The zoom is not very well controlled, which I presume comes from having only a few 'stops' between the W and T extremes for the zoom.5. While the picture size is ~2.4 MB, the camera took a while in writing to a cheap Lexar card. It could simply be the card.6. I was unable to connect the camera with the provided cable to 2 different computers. In each case, the L105 monitor turned on, which should not have happened, if the connection procedure is documented correctly.7. I called Nikon USA for help with the connection problem, but could not sort it out and suggested that I go to Target as this camera was created for Target. Wow! That was an honest feedback! Therefore, I conclude, the 199 MSRP is a price at which the camera was never sold to one single buyer, it was meant to be a 99 dollars goody.In summary - this camera is marred by several shortcomings or flaws or design choices, which I find unacceptable at the price I paid.

If you are a dedicated, creative photographer, you probably detest the use of Auto Mode. This camera is basically stuck on Auto Mode. You can't be creative with this one!-VERY SLOW... Example: Takes forever to take two shots. I'd say it shoots at 1/3.5 pictures per second. (A shot every three and a half seconds.)Overall, my bad portion of the review would stress, in a few words: This is a glorified cell phone camera and is overpriced.Pros:-Fairly good 720p HD with good, not great, audio. (Mono, not stereo. See here for a video I recorded with this camera: [...])-It has a pretty decent zoom and wide angle lens.-Compact and affordableMy Pros section would stress that this is a good camera if you aren't interested in pro photography.

The colors were off and i know for a fact my old camera would take a better shot since it is awesome in low light. Seems you can not change the ISO in this camera either. At first I was like \" it is $99\", but now i am like i rather put the $99 into somethin better. I don't have a lot of light at my place, and my iphone took a better picture then this. The flash washed out everything. So the reviews who say you dont know how to use this camera, you shouldn't have to \"use this camera in a special way\".

I brought the camera back to target.  I bought a nikon coolpix p500 during the summer, which I returned.  The shutter broke while on vacation.I just purchased another sony.  I purchased a sony cybershot dsc-h70. Every picture taken with this camera is superb.  I have no blurry pictures thus far.  I  have always purchased sony cameras and will continue.  My next camera will be a sony nex 5n.  I will not experiment with another brand again.  Stick with a sony you cannot go wrong.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Nikon L105 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Zoom - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XYsp5R1rL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0069SBXMQ"}}
