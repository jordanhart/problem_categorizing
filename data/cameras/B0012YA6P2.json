{"Reviews": [{"Title": "(Just an amateur here)", "Author": "C. McColl", "ReviewID": "RNVZV1UHQG9BR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the list price ($129.00) I really couldn't find a better camera. I work in a photo processing lab, where I also deal with and sell cameras for most of the day, so before purchasing my own I did a lot of hands-on research playing with and reading about all the cameras that were within the price I wanted to spend.  I'm still learning as far as all the fancy features, but if you're like me and just need a good camera for everyday type stuff, this one is perfect.  With its 7.1 mega pixels, it takes really sharp pictures and what I really like is how fast the shutter is. There's virtually no delay between the time you focus the camera and go to snap the actual picture. That was my biggest problem with my old camera-- I'd go to focus in and then by the time I actually snapped the photo, the delay was so annoyingly long that the moment was lost.  The LCD screen is a great size, not too large and not too small. At 2.5\", you get a really good idea of what you're shooting, even without a viewfinder.  The only complaint I have is that it's not as great outdoors in bright weather. The screen gets really washed out and makes it kind of difficult to get a good shot. This is fixable though, as they sell pop-up shade clips (about $10) you can attach to the camera so as to correct that. I haven't tried them personally, but heard they work really well.  I also really like the size of the camera itself. A lot of people are attracted to the super slim tiny cameras you can fit in a pocket, but that didn't appeal to me.  I wanted something I'd be comfortable holding, fit well in my hands, and didn't feel like I was going to drop it. Its like the perfect size for me, because it's still really compact but not so small that it gives me anxiety over dropping it/breaking something. Alternately, its not so big that I can't easily carry it around with me.I would consider this camera a step up from a lot of others in the price range. Along with the scene modes (which is pretty standard on most point and shoots anyway) it has a manual setting, which is fun to play around with and really easy to navigate. For someone like me who is still learning all the technical stuff it's a good first camera. You can customize a fair amount but its not overwhelming and hard to learn. At my job we are trained on what are the best selling points, features, etc, and whereas I take that into mind I also know that everyone is picky in their own way and some people care about certain features more than others. Personally I just wanted something to use on vacations, to take pictures of friends and I, my cats, etc.  If you want something for fast action scenarios, sporting events and the like, you might want to skip this camera. It's only got the standard 3.4 optical zoom, which really is not that far, and even though it zooms farther digitally...it will get more blurry the further in you go.  That is one thing Canon needs to improve upon-- a lot of their lower end models like this one have poor image stabilizing.Canon's face detection technology is pretty cool though.  In Auto mode (and probably manual too, I'm not positive though) it actually locks onto a person's face and almost highlights it...like zooms just their face in so you can see if it's clearly focused before taking the pic. This is a feature you can turn on or off in the Menu settings.  It throws you off a bit in relation to the rest of the photo, but once you get the hang of it it's really helpful (in group shots especially.)Bottom line - great deal for the price!  You see a lot of Nikon's (Coolpix series) in the $89-129 price range, but in my experience this newer Canon definitely surpasses them. I had a Nikon Coolpix 5600 (probably about 2 yrs old now), and whereas it took beautifully sharp photos, the lag time was incredibly slow and that's what made me like this Canon better. Faster shutter times make all the difference! Canon's photo software is easier to navigate as well, with more custom settings to play around with when you want to edit/share your pictures on your computer.  Most people are surprised to learn what kind of camera I have after they've seen the photos it takes.  I just think its really nice that you can get something of this quality for such a low price.OH- And a note about the AA batteries for this Canon:  Obviously if you use standard alkaline AA's your response time is going to be a lot slower. Investing in good quality rechargeables is more than worth the money, it makes all the difference.  I myself prefer Energizer's Lithium batteries, the blue and silver ones, as oppose to the rechargeables...just because they are specially designed for high powered devices like digital cameras, and you don't have to mess around with a charger, or the whole rotating batteries in and out.  I got a good couple months of use out of a set of two, while taking pictures frequently...on a trip, and even just in everyday daily use.  It's about $5 for a two pack and $9 for 4.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "A good entry-level camera", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R2KPA1WGVUWKZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These PowerShot \"A\" cameras are Canon's attempt to deliver the quality and features of its more expensive PowerShot \"G\" and PowerShot Pro \"S\" lines (such as full zoom lenses) at a budget price. The results are pretty good. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use all of these cameras. I earn my living at Walt Disney World writing a travel guide, and nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShots.)Here's my opinion of the top-selling \"A\" series cameras:7TH PLACE: Featuring Canon's acclaimed Digic III processor, the 2007-model A560 includes the company's face-detection metering system and a decent red-eye removal. It's a nice camera, but a better value is the new A470 (see below). $150 list.6TH PLACE: The A570IS is the same camera as the A560 but with optical image stabilization and the ability to shoot manually. $200 list.5TH PLACE: You can do a lot with the sweet little A630. It's a 2006 model, but has a flip-out LCD panel and lots of manual controls. The shots I've seen from this model look great. Keep your ISO under 800 and you won't get any noise. $350 list. (Canon offers a 2007 version of this camera that I haven't had much experience with yet, the A650 IS. It also lists for $350.)4TH PLACE: The 2008-model A580 is an A590IS (see 1st Place, below) without image stabilization and with semi-automatic instead of manual controls. $150 list.3RD PLACE: The fully-loaded A720 IS has all the toys, including a 6x zoom (35mm film equivalent of 35-210mm), image stabilization, adjustable flash power and optional second-curtain flash. This last feature means you can make the flash fire at the end of a long exposure, instead of the beginning, so moving subjects streak into focus instead of out. A 2007 model. $200 list.2ND PLACE: The 2008 entry-level A470 (the camera on this page) is great for kids or anyone just looking for a good basic camera. But frankly, it's better than basic. It includes Canon's face detection technology and has a zoom lens, 14 shooting modes and the ability to set exposure compensation, ISO and white balance manually. Plus it looks great with the color inserts. Everyone with this little camera always seems to be having fun. $130 list.1ST PLACE: The A590IS is the A580 (see 4th Place, above) with image stabilization and with the option of full manual controls. For an extra $30 those features are well worth it. I bought this model for myself. $180 list.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful camera with one major shortcoming", "Author": "JOHN F.

The drawback is that the camera has no view finder. You take a picture by looking at it in the LCD display.

You will definitely want to purchase the memory card on amazon as well because the 32MB memory card that comes with this camera will hold maybe 15 pictures or so.  The 2GB memory card for only $10 holds about 1000 pictures.When this camera arrived to me, I turned it on and it asked for the DATE and TIME.  But when I powered down the camera and then turned it back on later, it again asked for the date/time.  So the camera was not saving the Date/Time.  I opened the battery cover and their is a slot for the CR1220 Date battery which is as small as a watch battery.  IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN.  The + symbol of the battery was facing up and in reality, the - symbol needed to be facing up.  After I flipped around this 'watch battery', the camera was able to save the Date/Time and it never again asked me for the Date/Time each time I started it up.  I wrote to Canon and requested they retrain their staff with this issue since it caused me alot of headache.  Overall, the camera works great!  Large LCD screen, easy to handle, uses only 2 AA batteries and has 5 different resolutions to choose from when taking pictures, including a widescreen resolution and a Date/Time stamp selection so the date/time get stamped onto each picture you take.

The image stabilization worked well - I didn't have too much trouble due to camera shake, despite having to hold it at arms length to take pix, rather than look through a viewfinder which I had been accostomed to. Shot almost everything at 5 Mpixel rather than 7 MP, though I did use the widescreen mode a couple dozen times, which I was very happy with.

Klinker", "ReviewID": "RKAC4X5UL891U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one fantastic little camera.  I purchased it for my wife as a replacement for an earlier generation Sony about two months ago.  It is also one of Consumer Reports recommended cameras, is simple to operate... turn it on and click. It takes excellent photographs considering its 7.1mp and 3.4X zoom.  It does its best in the auto mode, which is what I think this camera was really intended for.  The camera's 38-to-132mm-equivalent offers a slightly longer than usual reach. A 2.5-inch screen is the only method of framing your shot, and can be difficult to use on sunny days. Get a little peel and stick folding hood for those occasions.  You won't find a lot of controls on the A470, but adjustable ISO, exposure controls, and manual white-balance settings offer some flexibility when shooting. The antishake works very well.  Another nice feature is that it uses AA batteries.  I use NIMH and keep a couple of extra sets charged and handy.  There are many more usable pictures now than we had with the sony.  One thing I have learned is that megapixels means little once you have reached a certain point except for the size of the end product.  And, for an entry level point and shoot it is doubtful most of us will be making too many 11X17's for Life magazine.  Even then, you could do so if you keep the ISO at 80.  The other nice attribute is the capability of movies.  This little camera has been used several times in the movie mode and I was delighted with the outcome.  Size wise, it is not one of those slim ultracompact pocket cameras at about 2 inches thick.  It can fit into a pocket with a bit of a bulge, but I really like this size better as its more substantive to hold and steady when shooting..  I have used the ultracompact, and find it more difficult to handle and the shake possibilities are greater.  The software it comes with is a snap to use and makes the download process easy searching for only the most recent photos in memory.  I have put 4GB SDHC in the camera, which gives it around 1000 pix at the highest resolution, or a combination of ample movie making as well as couple of hundred photos.  If you are looking for a simple point and shoot and don't mind the heavier feel, then this one is for you.

I expected it to be better than my Nikon as this one is 3.5 years newer, has better resolution and a bigger screen.  It's just okay, IMHO, hence the 3-stars.  I'd probably give it a 3.5 star rating if I could.Battery:  Battery life seemed a bit weak to me.  This camera uses AAs so I bought the Energizer Ultra Lithiums.  They're pricey but they're good batteries.  I did not count my shots but I did use the flash on about 30 out of about 100-120 photos before the batteries were nearly done.Controls:  The controls seemed fairly intuitive to me.  This camera uses a wheel the change modes but also to access the \"view pics\" mode.  My Nikon has a separate button to access \"view pics\".  So do some of the Sony's.  Personally, I prefer that but that is more of a preference than anything.LCD:  the LCD is good  I have not used it outside in bright light yet.  But be aware that w/o a viewfinder, the LCD is the only means you have for properly framing your subject matter.Size and feel:  the camera is a little bulky at 1 5/8\" thick but the overall size and buttons should be conducive to comfortable use by any size hands, small lady or large man.Connectivity:  on one end of the camera there are 3 interfaces:  1. DC in, presumable for use with an optional (not provided) power supply;  2. USB works well.  Simply put the camera in \"view pics\" mode and plug it in and you can either do your thing in the Canon software (which I have not/will not do) or simply access them via Windows Explorer.  3. A/V - a single proprietary 1/8\" mini pluag into the camera produces a single composite video RCA/M plug and a single monaural RCA/M audio plug to connect to a TV or VCR or DVR.Picture Quality:  This was probably my greatest disappointment.  I expected that a 3.5 year newer and 40% greater resolution (7.1MP vs 5.1MP) would have given me greater clarity and detail.  Usually with electronics as the months go by, yesterdays \"cutting edge\" becomes tomorrow's \"plain vanilla\".  That was not the case for me with this particular item.  I still prefer to use my old Nikon, with the now broken battery door (thanks to the unconfessed sin of one of my 4 precious children), for capturing important moments.I'm going to stop here because this is (currently) a $100 7.1MP Canon camera.  Not deserving of being \"picked to pieces\".  For $100 it's a pretty decent little unit.  I have to think this is a whole lot better than some of the other full-featured, sub-$100 cameras out there.  Just be aware that it is not on par with (probably any) $250 point and shoot.  Be aware that the specs and the brand do not dictate the quality or performance of the camera.  In fact, hands-on experience will demonstrate that quality and performance of particular features/functions of cameras will vary from model-to-model, regardless of brand, specs and price.As I finish writing this review I think that perhaps this camera may deserve a 4-star rank, if it is being compared to other low-price cameras but since I have only used mid-range digital P&S; cameras I cannot make that determination.  As a digital P&S; in general I can only give it 3 stars.  I hope this is clear enough and helps someone with their purchase decision.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fine general purpose camera", "Author": "John A.

If I had to make a less than positive comment, it's that the 186 page manual is in PDF format; that means iit is in the Canon disk, not a printed manual!  It's a bugger to print if you're not good at printing such PDF documents using both sides of the paper.  On the computer screen, the manual is quite big and bright. Also if your sharp with computers, you can download the manual to your memory card and read the manual from the camera screen, while you're away from home and your PC!.

Camera takes a great picture and does video. We haven't tested the video just yet. Camera handles dim situations relatively well, not without moderate pixelation, but I am nonetheless impressed.I have not deciphered how to easily remove mass photos from the camera on my Macintosh. Camera seems to be one-by-one delete. I guess I could drop and dump when the camera is on my desktop downloading photos.Still playing around with the camera with time I don't have currently to discover all the cool features. Downloading is a snap, and similar to most cameras. I also appreciated the use of a SD memory card. You can buy them anywhere. Love the orange color! Exactly what we wanted.Fits well in our hands and pockets (a must for us). We didn't want a large camera. For the price I wouldn't be devastated to take this camera as a loss and I have been nothing but pleased to this point with this great little camera. Perfect for our needs of real estate. Clean crisp photo and not an overbearing flash. No big \"blow-outs\" of white to discriminate details, but again early on with the camera. Still takes a great well-sized photo and love it. I will take it also on personal trips too.Only thing I am not crazy about are the markings of how to \"hit enter or accept\" on the camera. It doesn't come naturally with the icons and markings Canon chose. Just something to get used to and not second nature for me yet. Still LOVE this camera.update 9/18/09: Camera is still working great. Lapse between photos for quick shots gets annoying after awhile, but it does the job and takes a decent photo. We use the video portion of camera still as well. This camera has been good to us overall for our quick business camera. There are many more fine tuning features we could be using as well to even further enhance the quality of our photos that I am still discovering. I love Canon cameras. Great for the price is still my feeling. (plus it's orange! LOL) ... please note I am not a professional, but I do take a decent photo. ;-)update: 6/10: The camera has now stopped focusing and is taking horrible photos. It's done. LAME! LAME! Two years for a point shoot's survival? That's a joke. We took such kind care of this camera. Even if it were an easy fix, I wouldn't put another dime into it. Since my 9/09 review it's been downhill and shutter time was taking longer and longer to rip off shots. I grew a strong hatred of this \"easy\" camera.

The manual recomends that you take some practice/test photos to find out which features you like and of course to see if the camera works like it should. So I put in a new set of batteries and I ended up taking about 10 pictures and the annoying low battery warning light came on. Ok, I thought just a bad pack of batteries. So I decided to try another unopened set of regular(alkaline) batteries, so after 15 photos this time, the low battery light came on again! I said: \"thats it, Im returning this camera\".

It's survived 8 years of heavy use, lots of drops and even some abuse in it's life and it still manages to work to this very day, something many modern cameras won't do so if you are a klutz with cameras, it might be worth picking one up if you need a camera that keeps on tickin' at a reasonable price used. Just know the majority of these cameras are going to have to be bought used unless you're lucky to find NOS of Refurbished models and New models, so buy these knowing you have to be careful what one you buy. If it's beaten up, price accordingly or skip for a good condition one.If you do pick one up, the image quality is good, but as I said before it's been surpassed by leaps and bounds, so it simply will not compare to a new camera sensor wise. It is however a very capable basic camera, as long as you don't expect images as good as newer cameras can pull off at this pointFor the zoom, it has 3.4x Optical zoom and for most people, this is going to be adequate unless you need more zoom, and if this is the case, shop the \"G\" or \"S\", or \"SX\" cameras instead. These have far more zoom then this does. I find this level of zoom to be find for most things I use this camera for, and that's cases where I don't bring my SX150 or don't want to because this will suffice. Just know the more you zoom, the more trouble this camera will have with Autofocus.As for the Autofocus on this camera, I won't call it great or even perfect, but so-so since it's a budget camera. It tends to have a bit of trouble focusing in on smaller objects, even a good distance away and zoomed in a little. There is a Macro mode that helps in the P mode of the camera, but you can't use the flash so it's not ideal in low light or cases of shaky hands, and should use a tripod if you ever use the Macro mode on it.As to the battery situation, use Lithium batteries or NiMh batteries, not Alkaline for good runtime. It's not as bad as say a newer camera with Alkaline batteries used, so they may work longer in a pinch, but you should still not use them in it. They're a waste of money for Digital cameras. You will end up paying more for Alkaline batteries over time then NiMh or Lithium batteries.For manual controls, this is a \"A\" series camera, so don't expect too much. You'll get the bare minimum that entry level cameras have, and nothing more or less. It's not substantial enough to dedicate as much of this review to, except leaving it at very limited manual modes.If this camera were to die tomorrow, would I consider it again? No. It's too old to consider unless you're on a very limited budget that doesn't allow better then this age of camera used. It's a great camera, but it's time came and went. These are also knows for lens error issues that can be fixed, but usually aren't worth the trouble and picking another used one up is more viable then repairing the old one at this point, unless circumstances require you to repair it for whatever reason. You can use the worn one for parts, so it makes no difference since it's still reusable for parts anyway. The only case this would be viable is if you need MMC support since newer cameras usually lack it because it's being phased out of newer cameras at this point. Unless you need MMC support or can't do better, this camera isn't the best choice anymore. It was a great camera in 2008, but it's best to upgrade this camera if it fails at this point.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "Bob Urbani", "ReviewID": "R1FUQDCWHM34TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced the memory card with one that has more memory and cannot be happier.

I expected it to be a wonderful camera for taking all those pictures of my vacation. It never did disappoint me and it produced wonderful results, some of which do indeed look very artistic. I have a friend who's a professional photographer, and he did praise some of the pictures that I took. It really never failed me.The first major thing that other reviewers mention is the design of this beauty. It's very well-designed and isn't ugly at all. It sure isn't as slim as some other cameras, but I think that the size is just right, the buttons aren't hard to press and it has that intuitive Canon interface that allowed me to take my first pictures of my vacation right after I left the airport.I bought Energizer Rechargeable Batteries for use with them, and they generally lasted for about 4-5 days of average tourist usage - this means taking a picture every 5-10 meters. I don't use flash as I only took pictures in daylight, when sightseeing and public transportation networks were functional. The battery life is great.I only had one issue with the battery life. I always had the camera in my backpack, and it did get turned on somehow and remained on till the batteries were empty a couple of times. This actually prevented me taking any pictures of one of the most beautiful towns that I have been to, which is a real pity. It was on a weekend and I couldn't find any place where I can find some batteries. I think that Canon should add a functionality that will prevent the camera from staying on for too long.Another issue that I had with this Camera was the fact that it takes grainy pictures when the light is poor. This means that most pictures taken in the dark will be somewhat grainy. I don't think that it's a real issue as taking pictures of ghosts isn't one of my hobbies, but it still is something to consider.Another thing to consider is the level of the details. When you download your full-resolution pictures to your computer, open them in an image viewer, and zoom in to 200-400% you will notice that the pictures can be grainy. This isn't that great when you're editing those pictures in Photoshop, but this isn't a real issue if you're not a professional photographer or a hobbyist. You can not the pictures from this camera to be as crisp as those coming from a Nikon D3 after all.All my customer images on Amazon were taken using this camera, you can see how great this camera really is.I took thousands of pictures with this camera and it's still going strong. I think that it will really serve me well for my needs for years to come. I am not a photographer, and all that I am interested in is taking pictures of the places that I go to, family, and friends. This camera does that, does it well, and comes at a great price. It's unbeatable in this price range. It's a great camera for a student like me.It really helped me document my vacation and gave me more than two thousands pictures of pure beauty. I am really grateful for that.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "A470", "Author": "Camera Coffee", "ReviewID": "R3B1HQHT6BZKYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Takes nice quality pictures.As far as it being noisy, it is a bit noisy when you turn it on, and when you adjust the lens, but i didn't think it was bad at all.Cons: I don't think its heavy at all, but of course it isn't a really slim camera either.Summary: The delete button could have been marked better, as it has a diagram on it but not of the usual trash can. The trash can icon is directly under the delete button. My older dad, who's not so techy figured it out pretty quick but i still don't care for that particular thing.When your looking at the screen sometimes its a bit fuzzy or spotty but its great in macro if you hold the shutter button for a second or so. And the quality is never spotty or fuzzy, just the screen isn't perfect at times. Sometimes is great. But no major problems with it really. More on the noise quality: I don't even think it would wake a sleeping baby. There is no other noise except when the lens adjusts. You can turn all the other sounds off via the menu. Its not that heavy, but i suggest on any camera if you can to make sure it's the fit for your hands and to make sure that it isnt to heavy for you.Takes nice pictures, the video is good too.

Previous to digital, I had an old Canon Elph film camera that I loved (and previous to that, an old Canon AF35 from the 80's, which I adored-even though I had several SLRs)), but digital was the way to go for me, as I'm the type of person who will shoot 50-100 shots to get a good one.  This camera does it for me except for one feature:  when I am viewing pix on the camera, the zoom stays right in the center, I can't wander all over the image as I have been able to do in other Canon cameras, Sony Cybershots, and Olympus cameras.  That's it, my only complaint.  The nicest thing about this camera for me is that I can take shot after shot with minimal waiting.  Two weeks ago, we went to shoot the \"Fall Foliage\" (that always sounds so pretentious!)up by Flagstaff and my partner said \"I can't believe how fast that camera shoots-I've never seen one recover so fast!\".  Got some really nice shots,even while driving, so the motion thingy works pretty well!  I have a 2GB SD card, it's been enough, but I always have a spare in case I'm not able to get to my computer and upload the pix to Costco in a timely fashion.  Oh and the battery issue?  I have no complaints,when last used, I went through 250+ pictures before they registered as low (Kirkland Alkaline).

Meaning a camera I can haul everywhere I go, mostly for cloud pictures, when I can't carry my Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS 6MP with 12x Image Stabilized Zoom around.I picked this camera because it has a few features I hadn't found in other cheaper point and shoot cameras.  In manual mode it has an infinity focus mode, which I haven't seen anywhere.  This is excellent for cloud photos, as my other camera could almost never focus on them, but this camera lacks a manual focus, so I wasn't completely sure it would work.  The Infinity Focus completely solved that problem.It's other main selling point is an ability for \"Super Macro\", ie focusing on objects almost touching the lens.  It is also found in Manual Mode.  My S3 can do that, but I didn't think I would find a point and shoot with that capability.  Especially since I've played with some of the more expensive Canon powershots and they DIDN'T have the capability.  It makes up for the measly 3.4 optical zoom.One feature I haven't played with yet is long shutter, also in the manual settings, reached by pressing menu in the Exposure area of the Manual settings.  It looks like it can go up to 5 seconds or so.  Another feature I didn't expect on a camera without Manual Aperture or Shutter Speed adjustments.The lack of a viewfinder is a bit irritating, and noticeably a problem in direct sunlight, but the focus modes more than made up for it for me.It does have a big lag for flash pics, even with NiMH batteries.

(Maybe it'll still turn up, if not I may get a fancy camera for a replacement later.)The old one was 5 Mega pixels, the new one is 7 Mega pixels. What is shocking however, is the amount of improvements that were made in digital cameras, in only a couple of years. While the new camera is relatively cheap, it is vastly better than my old one (and the old one was very highly rated, and from the same manufacturer).While the old camera would take decent pictures, to get the exposure and colors right, I would always run the pictures through Photoshop's Auto-correct mode, before printing them out. With the new camera, they have somehow improved the electronics so much that every picture looks good straight out of the camera, without any correction in external software. (The external software will further improve on the pictures, but they're pretty good, even without touching them up.)I don't know if I just lucked out with this particular model of camera, or if every new camera is this good. Anyway, when I need another camera, I'm not going to waste my money on a high end feature loaded camera. I'll just buy another cheap highly rated  camera in a couple of years, and by then the advances made will more than outweigh the premium that I'd have to expend to get a loaded camera, now.All in all, this camera is a great buy, great value, and can't take a bad picture!", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "J.

It's a hassle changing these modes. And the modes that don't darken your picture, the blurry shows so you have to hold the camera very steady. There's also a choice of it not being blurry even if you're shaking it, but in that case, the camera is slower to take pics and load, and/or would have to be placed back to darken mode. You can't see full screen pics by setting the view mode to \"View All\" so it sucks having to see them smaller or you can do the full screen but then it sets to one-by-one.And the worse part is the batteries. It's what you get for paying cheap for a camera. I had to buy a Duracell battery charger and even duracell can't last that long before I have to charge it again. I end up having to charge it over just for using it a few hours. So it eats up a lot of power from the batteries.
