{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good", "Author": "David Tyree", "ReviewID": "R1P56QVGNJM4CT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I bought this with the hope of using it for all sorts of different projects. The one that prompted me to buy it is to look inside of one of my cars to see how bad the rust inside the frame rail was. It worked pretty well for this.The camera is pretty clear and the rotate screen feature, is nice, along with the brightness and contrast adjustment. I have used a rigid see snake before, and I find this tool to have a better quality camera and display then the see snake.It does have a jack for video out, which I haven't tried yet because it didn't come with a cable :( so far I haven't been able to find the cable for it yet - I'll probably have to make one.The camera requires 4 AA batteries to function. It feels reasonably well built and the quality looks to be pretty good - overall I am happy with it.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent product, a Must Have in the tool box", "Author": "Morphyous \"Eric LaPointe\"", "ReviewID": "R1LHR3JRRMIXGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read ALL the reviews prior to purchasing, and I'll admit, at first I was not sure about this one. But, I'm glad I had the guts to buy it.The pro's...It does what it says it will do.There are available add-ons (which I have not bought)The PRICE.The Con's...The plastic of the base unit is (as mentioned in other reviews) a little on the cheap side.I have used it several times, during some resent home upgrading projects. I have had no issues with this unit at all. I only buy and use high grade rechargeable batteries, and have yet had to recharge the batteries at all, so long battery life is possible... one thing to keep in mind is their are three on/off switches on this unit, I wonder if others made sure all three were in the off position which resulted in poor battery life, or if maybe they used cheap batteries. I also have borrowed an other make and model of this type of product from a friend for use during past projects... The only different was, his cost $250.00 and had a much shorter camera cord, the plastic of the handle was also of higher quality.The handle plastic is the ONLY reason I took away one star and only gave it a four star rating...BUT that is no reason not to buy this product. I am very pleased with the product, the seller, and the order processing. If I ever needed to buy another one, I would buy this one again, it has already paid for itself with the time that it has saved me, not having to spend hours blindly fishing wires threw the walls and floors.This would make an excellent gift.I would highly recommend this product to anyone.--Eric", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good piece for the dollars", "Author": "Chasman", "ReviewID": "R1MZ7PKAM4ST15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera works pretty well. I would recommend the wireless version. The camera cable is pretty stiff, as it needs to be, making the viewing of the display difficult at times while you maneuver the camera. This is an observation  of the product, not a complaint. For the money, it is hard to complain.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "maximum stars", "Author": "Roberta A.

I had no idea this existed for purchase by laymen; but for kicks did a search for \"fiber-optic camera\" because I was wishing I had a colonoscopy tool for what I needed to do.

Works really great and with the built in light you don't miss a thing. Well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone needing to see into really tight and dark places where mirrors won't fit.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works okay, but kind of awkward", "Author": "J \"tech head dc\"", "ReviewID": "R1G6CCH4DMQ4W5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this to look for critters that died in the wall. Gross, but I did find them. The batteries seem to last a long time for the unit, the screen is okay. I wish it was detachable now that I've tried fishing around some. The picture is kind of washed out and the LED lights only illuminate so much of a distance. It does have a night-vision kind of feel, but it's hard to get a great image. The tube is rigid and only 3 feet long. I have to twist it to rotate the camera more than I expected, to know what angle I'm looking at inside the wall. Manipulating the tube into a shape can be tricky. The attachments aren't super helpful, but who knows, maybe they'll be handy for something. Overall, not as easy to use as I'd hoped, but with a lot of practice and effort, it got the job done. I with the tube was longer, and I would opt for one with a detachable screen if I were to do it over again. For the price, I think it's a decent value.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Bad But.....", "Author": "G.
