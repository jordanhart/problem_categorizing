{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R2WA2HUIP4UBAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE:  I own this camera in silver, but the features are the same as the blue color.Let me tell you what a great camera this is - for the low price Amazon is charging you absolutely cannot go wrong choosing this one. It's on special for the Holidays but even if it goes up in price a little afterward, it's still a bargain for the features you get. The camera may be plastic, but it's a high-quality plastic with raised lettering, the build quality is excellent as well as the fit & finish, and the sharpness of the LCD is as good as I've seen on expensive cameras.I own a Panasonic DMC-TZ4 which cost well over $250 two years ago, and this is just as good, if not better, than my TZ4 which I still use, I just don't carry it in my bag as it's too heavy. This camera is light-weight and easy to toss in a bag, but I do recommend a case. It keeps your camera looking nice.One thing I want you to note if you don't get anything else from reading my review - the best way to keep your camera from getting a zoom error is to flick the switch on the back to the VIEW images side (green arrow); that way if your camera accidentally gets turned on in your bag, the lens will not open and zoom out. Not all cameras have the slide switch, but all the Panasonic cameras I'm aware of, do have the same type switch.OK, back to the camera. One thing I like about the LCD screen on this camera is you have a high-angle view choice. This comes in handy at parades when all the tall people are standing in front of you; all you do is hold your arms up over your head and you can still see what you are shooting at down below.The camera turns on fast, shoots fast, and recovers to take another shot the fastest of any camera I've ever used, and I've used many. This camera has MEGA Optical Image Stabilization, which is hard to find at this price. The lithium-ion battery life is excellent, I've shot over 250 pics and movies and it has not needed recharging. The battery charger comes with the camera, and will charge a dead battery in 90 minutes. Naturally, it also comes with the USB cable, photo-editing software which I don't care for and is not worth installing, and the A/V cable to plug into your TV for viewing photos & videos that way. BTW, A/V cables aren't being included in the lower-end cameras much anymore, but this camera does have them.Most of the time I leave it on the Intelligent Autofocus (IA) - this dedicated button is located on the top to the right of the shutter release - you can push and go from any other mode to this in an instant - this will let the camera choose on its own any of 6 different scenes so you don't have to decide yourself. I also like the regular scene modes - one of them you can make yourself skinnier. :) Another scene selection you can choose one of 3 frames to automatically surround your picture. Yet another you have a choice of Baby 1 or Baby 2 where you can also add name and age.One of the scene settings is called Flash Burst, where you can take 5 consecutive pics with flash by holding the shutter down; this is a great feature to have if you have a moving object such as a child or pet as you are bound to get at least one good shot out of the five.Picture quality is excellent. I've taken quite a few shots of my cats (on the pet scene mode) and when enlarged to full screen-view size on my 22\" monitor, I can see every strand of fur in great detail.One thing I find to be cute and I've never seen it before: the little green dot that comes on to show you are focused can be changed from a plain green dot to a heart, a flower, or even a car among other things. So this may appeal to the younger photographers too.The HD movie quality is excellent, even better than my Flip MinoHD 2nd generation. The only downfall of the HD movie is the QuickTime format which this camera uses, is an SD card HOG. I recommend getting a minimum of a 16 GB SDHC CLASS 6 memory card if you plan on taking a lot of HD movies. If you are just primarily taking photos, a 2 GB or 4 GB card will do fine and they are fairly inexpensive. And no, you cannot zoom in and out while making a movie. You can set the zoom before you press the button, but not during.This camera case is a perfect fit: Lowepro Volta 20 Camera Case (Black)", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice camera and a bargain also", "Author": "J. Pfeister", "ReviewID": "R1A0NF2ZD09LOO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been pleased with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1.  I have also purchased an 8GB SD card to use with it so I would not run out of storage space in a normal day of vacationing.  It is a little larger in size than my Canon Power Shot SD1100 IS but it will still fit in your jeans pocket so you don't have to carry around a camera bag.  The view screen is about as large as would fit on the camera.  Because it is a 12mb camera, you can do a lot of cropping and still end up with a printable picture.  The best thing I can say about the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 is that I would buy it again for myself and recommend to my friends.  The Amazon's price is right on this camera.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera, \"Why pay more?\"", "Author": "Raymond F. Hendrix", "ReviewID": "RGYZLLOG198BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really impressed with this camera. I had a more expensive Canon that I was replacing after it was damaged and I was expecting an inferior camera because of the price. Also I was not very familiar with the Panasonic line of cameras. My wife convinced me to buy this one after we reviewed the specs and reviews (most on other variations of this basic version i.e., FH1-20). Because of our budget we opted for this model and were we surprised by it's performance and quality! The lower number of pixels is really not a disadvantage unless you are planning to make large posters and the advantages are, more pictures on the battery and a few other things (more pictures per second in Burst mode for example). The camera is simple to use but it also has advanced features that enable you to take sunset views, action shots, close ups, bright back lighting conditions etc. etc.My first shot after I opened the box was of a rotating ceiling fan with the light on. What a beautiful photo! The next one was of a close up of a page in the instruction manual. Another crystal clear image. If you happen to get a poor image just search the advanced instruction manual (on supplied CD) and you will find how to do it better next time. Or, if you are lazy, just use the Auto Mode on all your shots and I assure you that you will not be displeased with the results except in unusual conditions.If you decide to buy an extra battery from Amazon it will be more powerful than the one supplied and you will get more photos per charge but the one included is adequate. Some memory is built into the camera but I advise that you buy a memory card to supplement it. By the way the camera takes great movies too. With the 8 GB card I purchased I can take 8 minute clips (I am not sure if the card or the camera is the limiting factor).All in all I can only say, \"Why pay more?\".", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great over all camera", "Author": "Luke skywalker", "ReviewID": "R1WFZATO2ZEWAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Camera takes really good pictures over all.

I ended up ordering 2 of these, one for my mom and one for myself. I LOVE this camera. I have a big Sony A200, but wanted a small camera for my purse and this is it. The picture quality is really good and I was even more impressed with the video quality. I didn't know it took video when I ordered it. Great and easy to use (for my mom), but you can customize a lot of things at the same time (for me). I also love how the battery comes with a small charger that plugs right into the wall and I don't have to worry about rechargeable AA batteries. Love, love, love this camera.

The FZ28 was bulky so we were looking for one that was pocket-sized. We went with the Panasonic brand because of our experience with the FZ28. When the FH1 was being sold under $100, we got it. Pictures and videos are just okay, nothing great. Not bad, but could be better. Images were crisper with the FZ28. It's okay for everyday use, but for special occasions, we will still be using the reliable FZ28.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Little Camera", "Author": "T.S.", "ReviewID": "RUOGAKV6IPIFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased several cameras and returned them before finding this gem.  Don't be fooled by other cameras offering more megapixels but inferior lenses and sensors. Even on full auto point-n-shoot mode or the many presets, this camera takes very good quality pictures. At full zoom pictures aren't grainy or indistinguishable as they were with other cameras we tried.  White balance is good - no orange people unless they over did it in the tanning beds.  Love the 5cm macro.  When you don't want to lug around your anti-tank DSLR, this Panasonic Lumix is a great choice.  If you're not used to small cameras, it'll take a little getting used to.  Good weight - feels perfect in your hands.  Nice metal body.  Great colors.

The main problem is auto exposition errors, also it's gets pictures on high iso's when it's not necessary, so you got dark grain pictures in the perfect sunny conditions. It occurs not every time but quite often. I had very old and cheap camera - Nikon Coolpix 4600 and it makes pictures better.Vide is not bad for the price, better than I expected.Good accumulator, works long. Also it qorks quite fast, looks good.So, it's probably worth it's price if it does pictures better.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Die hard Panasonic fan", "Author": "lovetoshop \"lovetoshop\"", "ReviewID": "R1CO020ABU30QQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned a Panasonic since 2004 and love that camera, last month while taking it out of closet, I bumped it against the wall and now the lens is stuck. So I had to buy another camera that was small enough to fit in my purse because the first one had 12x zoom it was as big as an SLR. Long story short, after doing a lot of research and reading reviews on numerous sites, I decided to buy this camera because it was on sale and I didn't want to buy other brands. I have been pleased with the results. For a camera that cost less than $100, since it was on sale, pix are great and shutter speed has improved also from the old Panasonic that I had. Just to compare, I got Nikon coolpix S3000 also since people keep praising Nikon and the shutter speed was painfully slow and the picture quality didn't even come close to the one that this camera had. This baby is small and lightweight though the battery life is not that great when compared to my 6 yr old Panasonic, the reason could be that this doesn't have a view finder so the lcd screen is always on. It'd be better to keep an extra battery handy. I am not a professional but I love taking pics of various objects and I am not easily pleased when it comes to a camera which is under $100. Mind you that this is not an SLR but for something that is less than $100, it takes great pix. I haven't explored all the settings yet but just used IA mode and it takes awesome pix with just that mode if you don't want to experiment with all the settings. I have had it for 2 weeks and have taken pix in a club,zoo,and on a cloudy day and I have been pleased. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars because of battery life and the shutter lag which is a lot better than the first Panasonic I had and the Nikon coolpix but I still with it were faster.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes great pics !", "Author": "Buckles", "ReviewID": "RI41ATUV575JE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't used it extensivly, but so far the camera seems great.
