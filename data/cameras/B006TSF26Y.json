Most pictures taken have to be deleted or just not used. Purchased for a ministry to take photos at our events. Has been mostly useless to us. We've tried everything we could to make it more profitable to no avail. The batteries have to be replaced constantly so we started taking the batteries out after each use to preserve them longer. The camera shuts itself off contantly; is noisy in its usage. Just an overall disappointing product. Would never recommend it.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1-megapixel camera for beautiful, frame-worthy shots.\nCase helps protect your camera from the elements.\nCleaning kit helps keep your camera free from dust and debris\nCamera features image stabilization, a 2.4\" LCD screen, 3x optical zoom and more.
