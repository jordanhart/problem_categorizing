It has a good picture and I was astonished at it's low light capability. The only complaint I have after about 1 month's use is that the information and directions included with the camera are VERY lacking. The only thing included tells how to adjust the varifocal lense and even then it is a poor desription and apparently poorly translated from another language (grammar). Even though there are 6 switches & 1 rotating level adjustment on the back of the camera there are no directions for any of that whatsoever. Perhaps they think a pro installer don't need them but for a camera of this price there would probably be many amateur installers buying them. There is also a tiny allen wrench included with the camera and I found \"a place\" on the camera to use it but I have no idea what it does! Lack of information is why I only gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 but otherwise I highly recommend.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Teaching Microscope Camera", "Author": "microscopyman", "ReviewID": "RCHNJQPE4JVNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent value and service.
