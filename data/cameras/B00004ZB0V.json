Add to that the high resolution and Sony's novel pixel interpolation software, and you've got a camera that will produce absolutely striking 8x10s- prints so good that you'll find it hard to believe they weren't made from film. Add to that the manula override and incredible cool looks of this camera and you've got a winning package- almost.Unfortunately Sony decided to equip this otherwise outstanding camera with their own proprietary memory stick storage format. These sticks cost anywhere from 20-50% more than SmartCards and are only available from Sony. And with the resolution this camera produces you'll need at least one 64 meg memory stick- more if you plan on extended outings. The ergonomics aren't great, either. This is not an easy camera to use with two hands and work the controls as well. It almost looks as if ergonomics were sacrificed for style.Hence only 4 stars. If Sony had used a more standard high-density storage format nd made it a little easier to handle they'd have a 5-star product.", "Date": "December 29, 2000"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use, Great Pictures", "Author": "Groovy Vegan", "ReviewID": "R1UIER3KZI1XVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a photography novice who chose this camera because I wanted: 1. a point and shoot that would make good shutter speed and F-stop decisions for me.  2. a single, high quality lens that telescopes and does wide angle, so I wouldn't have buy or change lenses.  3. excellent picture quality in prints and on screen. 4. an easy to use camera.  (I was quickly up to speed on most features after 1 read of the manual and a few experimental pictures.) 5. easy transfer of pictures to the computer.6. easy to use photo software that comes with the camera.The product excels in all these qualities except #5.  Also, I'm glad the battery's rechargeable, and that the lens cap is attached to the camera.I'm deducting the 5th star for 2 reasons:1.  I followed all the instructions in the manual for downloading my pictures and it didn't work.  I had to call customer service and be walked through an entirely different procedure not in the instructions.  Also, they recommended that I save pictures on my desktop so I won't lose them.  She told me other people have had the same downloading difficulty, but I don't know how widespread it is, or if it's been corrected.2.  I had to buy a couple extras to be completely satisfied with this camera:  (1) Extra battery because the one that comes with the camera only lasts about an hour.  (2) 64 Mb memory stick, because the 8 Mb memory that comes with the camera runs out very quickly.Bottom line:  Now that I've troubleshot the downloading problem and bought the extras, I'm very happy with this camera.", "Date": "April 20, 2001"}, {"Title": "DSC F505V vs previous F505E model", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RFZT4WEKLHHUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new F505V camera is a superb camera that has cured any niggles that I have with the previous F505E version, but Sony have  introduced a new problem that wasn't present in the F505E.On the F505E, with a 64 Mb memory stick, I could take over 300 shots at 1024 x 768 resolution, which matches the resolution I use on my PC. This is ideal if you have a month's annual leave (away from the ability to download all your shots onto your PC).  With the F505V, the lowest corresponding resolution is now 1280 x 960, which allows only 90 shots on the 64 Mb memory stick.Even if they can't provide a mechanism for fixing the resolution vs storage problem on the F505V itself, I would strongly recommend that Sony re-institute the 1024 x 768 resolution on future models of the camera.PS  The primary problem I have with the F505E is \"red-eye\", which means that, on all my indoor shots - and there are very many of them - I have to use the software provided to try and edit out \"red-eye\" manually. This painstaking problem has been eliminated on the new F505V by strobing the flash before taking the picture.  The F505V also now has the ability to use an external flash, which might have also helped with the \"red-eye\", had it been available on the F505E.", "Date": "March 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use; Astounding Image Quality", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RQJCPPG0G419N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi professional photographer.

It is VERY ergonomic, contrasted to what another reviewer said. In fact, that's one of the MAIN reasons I bought it! It just feels so good! In fact, it's about the ONLY camera out there that you can say that about.Second, low light etc. - I think that review was for the F505 - the F505V has MUCH improved all of that and I am quite impressed! I've taken the thing ALL around London, Europe, NY, LA, Las Vegas, South Africa etc. and taken GREAT, stunning night shots with it in almost zero light. It's awesome! Ya just gotta 'work it' right. (and have a tripod or very steady hands!)It works like a standard 35mm - slightly depress the button and it comes to focus - then you hold it - compose and wait for the right moment - then - press all the way down and it's taken THAT instant! That's the way to avoid the delay. Still - less of a delay would help!Lack of viewfinder?I thought that'd be a real problem - but have not yet found it to be. It's an excellent screen - I've compared it to many and it is just gorgeous with detail. In bright sun you hold it 'waist level' style and actually capture the sun light in it to make your image clear. Quite cool - like those waist level 2 and a quarter cameras. Once I got used to it - I love it.All and all - a gorgeous - beautiful camera that EVERYONE will admire and ask you about. (trust me - I met MANY people at stonehenge, South Africa, Rome etc. just asking about it.)Ya don't get that with those cheesy 30 dollar-looking '60s silver box cameras or with the plastic 'don't-drop-me' wimpy looking Nikon cheesy sounding 'coolpix'.

The 505's image quality is very good and often opt for the lower resolution images (1856x1392).  The low light capabilities are quite good, but you end up having to take one or two shots before finding the best as there is no enhancement of the LCD image prior to a shot.  It is sometimes difficult to target with the camera unless you are used to the LCD screen.  The menu system is very easy to navigate and allows you to do almost everything you need w/o the use of the computer.  Despite the limited (~65min) battery, it is adequate to fill a 64 or 128Mb Memory Stick through normal use.  A second battery along with the charger can keep you shooting all day long or as long as your memory holds out.  As with any Sony product, the memory will cost you more but go to Synchrotech.com and they have good prices.  The flash on the 505 is excellent.  At its highest setting, it can easily penetrate 16-20ft.Because of the 505's odd shape, it can be a challenge finding a good case for it other than the custom Sony case.  I ended up with a Cascade Pack (#66009) a part of the MULTI pack series by MRock.  Everything I need (camera, extra memory, extra battery, A/C battery charger and cables) will fit into this case and the overall size isn't much more than the camera itself.Many of the people I work with wouldn't buy this camera as it is more camera than they need.  The 505V is really for someone who wants more control of their shots than the simple point and shoot cameras that are out there, but the 505 does have that ability.", "Date": "January 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "Theresa M.

I've taken some stunning night shots, but dudded out on what I would have thought were easy twilight pics.  Go figure.  I'm sure there are ways to overcome this problem, but I have yet to mine them out of the manual.  (I bought my camera in Japan, and I think I got the hastily translated version of the English instructions!) Backlighting the screen more in low light would, of course, spoil the low light of the environment, wouldn't it?That said, I 'm really pleased with my purchase. It's several classes above the silly toys which passed as digital cameras until now.  Yes, the memory sticks are expensive, but I use mine in other Sony devices (like a dictating machine) which makes the price a bit easier to take.  And, yes, you do need to supplement the puny 8 MB stick you get with the camera.I had no problems with the software, in contrast to some of the other reviewers.  In fact, I use it in preference to Microsoft Photo Editor for images I capture elsewhere.The lens is marvellous.  It makes the camera a truly professional instrument--in fact, one of the reasons I chose it was because I noticed an art-director friend of mine had bought one.I must admit, though, the lens doesn't seem to go as wide as standard cameras.

Early attempts by the industry were just that, however it seems strange to me that the pioneer of the digital revolution (CD) would be ahead of the major camera makers at their own game (at least in price range). As for this particular camera it's nothing but great. With the rotation feature of the camera body, it can used as a waist level viewer with all the advantages of such. The hardest part I had was not trying to put the LCD viewer up to my eye like a 35. The Carl Zeiss lens however was the turning point for me though, and the lack of this fine lens in Sony's new CD burner was a great disappointment. The little tricks that comes with this camera including an incamera editing and a computer photo shop for PC use only make it better. (Not as poweful as Adobe but easier to use). The clipette movie pegs are one of the best features. If you want kid movie pictures simply take a 15 sec. MPEG and edit for the best in the computer.

I had been going out on nature outings with the other interns, and wanted a way to share my experiences with the folks back home.  Over the last year I've taken my 505V on hiking trips, trips into caves and even on a diving trip, where I took some pics before getting in the water.  Here are my observations from my experiences.First of all.  NEAT camera!  It looks like something Captain Kirk would use to snap pictures of the orange-skied planets he used to visit!  The controls are laid out well, so that buttons and things are under one's fingers when he holds the camera, and the menu system is simple enough to use.  I did not notice any loss of sharpness around the edges of the frame; the Zeiss-designed lens, mounted well away from the heat-producing CCD, probably has something to do with this.  The controls permit some simple Real Camera-type manipulations: several shutter speeds, several exposure times, that sort of thing, but there aren't nearly as many tweakable settings, or as much range, as there would be in  a film camera.  The 505V is designed to be used as a waist-level camera, and shots taken this way should be composed with this in mind.  The front of the lens is threaded for standard filters (don't recall the size offhand), obtainable at a photo store.  A UV filter to protect the lens and a polarizing filter for outdoor shots of sky and clouds might be a couple of good things to consider.As did several of the other reviewers, I have had problems getting good pictures in low-light conditions.  Perhaps the CCD is not sensitive enough, or the shutter is held open too long for hand-holding, but low-light pics tend to come out blurry.  The built-in flash is, of course, too close to the lens, though that's a problem with any camera whose flash is mounted right on the body.  Last, the 505V is big.  I've had it in some rather surprising places, but it was an effort to take it out of its case and put it back for every picture.  I am considering getting a simple, compact digicam as an auxilliary adventure camera for spontaneous shots or narrow cave passages, though I do not anticipate the new camera replacing my 505.I have bought a PCMCIA card for plugging the Memory Stick into my laptop (heh! I can mount it as a Linux filesystem and not have to touch any Windows software at all!), an extra battery, and of course, a bigger Memory Stick than the 8M one that came with the camera.  I have also purchased a small Pelican case from the dive shop, so that I can get my pack wet or drop it onto hard places (or fall and land on it, as has also happened a few times), and not worry about damaging my camera.  The Pelican case also fits an extra battery and as many Memory Sticks as I care to take along, and is thus a Good Thing.", "Date": "October 31, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great curves and handling", "Author": "J.

The image quality is outstanding, only the colors are a bit dramatic (SONY style..) but that is easy to fix in Photoshop, just reduce the hue a little bit. Light sensitivity is not overwhelming, like ASA 100, the low light pictures are a bit noisy - I cool the camera to below 20 degrees Celsius for reduced thermal noise from the CCD. The lens is top quality and it shows, unusual for a digital camera. My main problems: There is no real view finder, only the LCD. In low light situations (night, romantic restaurant shot, etc) you see plain nothing on the LCD. You have to shoot a couple of times to adjust the frame. Basically not usable in real life conditions when you have to deal with moving objects - shame. Great plus for low light is the manual focus, though. If the autofocus doesn't work properly you can switch to manual and adjust a ring on the lens like in a SLR camera - great idea, but poor execution, the ring is so sensitive that you jump from infinity to 1 meter so quickly that everything inbetween is very hard to adjust to. Also the time from first pressing the button to autofocus ready to exposure can be some 2 seconds - try shooting kids with that, a nightmare. But, since the extra tries don't cost you anything extra, you can just freely fire away, eventually you will catch a nice shot that way too (need a 64MB stick though, the 8MB it comes with are plain useless - not very customer oriented, SONY!!). The video modes are just a joke, at 320x240 pixels the 15 sec movies look horrible on anything but a tiny window on the computer. Alltogether a great piece of equipment. I made 2000 images in the first three weeks and I still love it. Maybe future versions will even have a better low light viewer function, faster response, better manual focus and pseudo-motor function.

The LCD screen is washedout from the light of day. NEVER BUY A CAMERA THATDOES NOT HAVE A VIEW FINDER ALONG WITH THE LCDSCREEN! When I first bought the camera I thought it hada view finder and ended up keeping it too long beforeI could really determine that I needed one. By that timeI couldn't return the camera! I think Sony deliberatelyomits this information on all cameras in order to sellthose with LCD screens that don't have view finders.Wouldn't you know it, SONY upgraded thismodel with a 5 pixel WITH a VIEW FINDER! This seemsto be a problem with SONY. There are just too manydifferent models that Sony should retire (pull andtake the loss) instead of confusing loyal customersand selling out dated and techno defective productsto a public that still tends to trust the SONY Brand.I think my next digital camera will be a Cannon!", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best camera you ever own!", "Author": "\"stanmed\"", "ReviewID": "RCQVIZZ3IX4RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this camera very professional and effective in many ways.
