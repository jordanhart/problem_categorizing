Wild", "ReviewID": "R23P3A27YTN1CI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Despite the less than glimmering reviews on this page, I researched this camera and others for 2 weeks before ordering it on Amazon. Being neither a camera-know-it-all with the leverage to criticize a Carl Zeiss lens nor being technologically deficient, I use this camera to take casual photos of family and friends and landscapes and am greatly looking forward to taking it with me on summer travels.If you are an average to novice photographer looking for a lightweight, slim, sharp, and efficient camera, don't be put off by other reviews which throw around numbers and names and put this camera down. It is not designed to be a $500, state-of-the-art, professional piece of equipment so I do not know why people are writing about it and putting it down like it was supposed to be.:: This camera does the job and the 1000 ISO speed is superb. Without flash, I can take clear pictures that are not grainy.:: There are no functions on the camera that are difficult to figure out, and many optional funtions which I like such as an auto-focus on the foreground subject with slight blurring of the background, which makes the subject seem sharper in contrast.:: Start-up time from pushing power is incredibly fast.:: Battery stamina is truly impressive (my previous camera guzzled AA batteries like no tomorrow). I half filled my 1GB memory stick before recharge. Sony has improved their Stamina line of batteries a long way.:: The flash is not over-powering and white-washing like on other cameras, but is still powerful enough to light subject fields nicely:: For the $50 price difference from the DSCW50, it seems like the only considerable difference is a bigger LCD screen, and the screen on the DSCW30 is quite sharp enough.:: I agree with another review though that the only particularly discalming feature is the plastic slide-cover over the battery and memory chambers. At times it seems as though it is not protective enough, and it is just a little too easy to slide open.For a little over $200, 6 MP, versatile shooting modes, great battery life, and the sleek, compact design, I think this product is the best bang for the buck and I don't regret my purchase in the slightest.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very nice portable camera", "Author": "N.

It's about the size of a cigarette box.  I also like the fact that there is no wait-time for this camera as far as going from the on button to taking pictures -- it doesn't take as long as some cameras I've seen.  It also doesn't take long from taking a picture and viewing it.  There is virtually no wait time.  Also, I'm very happy with the picture quality.  It has a very nice natural look to them, instead of some cameras that are over-saturated with unnatural colors.  Another great feature I like about this camera is the battery life.  You can pretty much take lots of pictures (over 400 according to Sony) with one battery charge.  Overrall, I'd recommend this camera for anyone who wants a good quality camera that is light and easy to carry around, with a great battery life.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "comments on reviews....", "Author": "Christopher T.

No, it doesn't perform as well as cameras that cost 50-100% more, but why would it?!?!  It does perform better than everything else I tried in this price range.One of my top priorities is how quickly a camera powers up, how quickly you can take the first photo after turning it on, and the overall shutter lag - out of all the cameras I tried, in this price range, this was the clear winner.\"I ended up selling mine and got a Sony DSC-P200 instead. Superb construction (made in Japan) with all-metal body, much better quality images.\"While it is true that you can find P200s for good prices now that it has been discontinued, comparing the W30 to what had originally been a >$400 camera hardly seems fair...there is simply no reason the W30 should perform as well as the P200, it was never designed to.I have owned (and currently own) a lot of cameras.

So far I haven't been let down by this little camera. Not only is it tiny and pocketsized, but it can take up to 400 pictures between charges- fantastic! I'm also pleased with the range of photos that you can take- it has several scenery settings, including landscape, beach/water, and snow for instance, and a comprehensive auto mode with programmable settings. The video capturing is surprisingly clear and it picks up sound much better than I thought it would.Its ISO sensitivity (that goes up to 1000) feature is GREAT and is something I haven't seen with many digital cameras- I took recently pictures in low light and the clarity was spectacular, and the photos didn't look washed out at all. I took pictures with my old Canon in a similar setting and the photos didn't come out nearly as good.The playback button is also a very innovative design, and I love the trimming feature- you can crop a picture using the camera itself, instead of using photoshop afterward.My only qualm with the camera so far: the battery/pro stick cover is a cheap plastic that was poorly put on the camera... other than that, I *love* this camera and would recommend it for anyone who wants an easy to use point and shoot!", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good investment, more research would've helped...", "Author": "Booker T. Law", "ReviewID": "R2L3RN2PJNXSB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony Cybershot DSCW30 digital camera is not made with a metal body! A metal framed slim-bodied camera was what I really desired. Instead, I received a slim-bodied metallic looking camera. If anyone is looking to purchase a metal framed camera and is conflicted about who's right on this feature of Sony's Cybershot, visit any electronics retailer and view the Cybershot DSCW30 for yourself. I was lucky enough to have a Sony company store near my home where I was able to talk to the manufacturer's people directly. They confirmed that while the camera appears to be metal, it is really all plastic. I too have experienced problems when focusing on images I've zoomed in on via the LCD on the camera, but these focus issues are not reflected in the image once captured. I took this camera to Europe and it was a real gem. I highly suggest purchasing a memory stick, as I used a 2GB Memory stick duo (the manufacturer's website instructs users to only use the \"duo\" and not the standard sized stick for all who are wondering about compatibility) and the camera captured approximately 450 images and says it could get about another 400 in 6MP fine format. To boot, the battery is awesome and never required charging for all those shots and still shows more than half power remaining. A good camera deal, though I might have chosen the larger LCD of the DSCW50 for an additional 40 dollars.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "Alex Green \"alx779\"", "ReviewID": "R3G18EIEYY96G3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Cybershot DSC30 6MP camera as a replacement for my 3-year-old 5MP Sony. Sadly, I have to say that my older camera took much better pictures than the new one.The construction of DSCW30 is cheap (plastic) and rather flimsy. The camera is made in China. My old camera was made in Japan and had an all-metal body. This explains the lower price of DSCW30.The LCD is bright and easy to see. The control layout is good. There is a separate power button and a separate \"play\" button (so you don't have to rotate the mode dial back and forth anymore). The menu system is simple and intuitive.I have only the good things to say about battery life. It is simply great! You can take up to 400 shots on a single charge. Separate charger is also a plus.The quality of the photographs, however, is not what you would expect from Carl Zeuss lens. They often come out soft and there are occasional focusing problems. The colors aren't always reproduced correctly, especially in low light. Moving objects appear blurred even with high ISO settings and there's no way to control shutter speed. Weak flash doesn't help things either. Overall, the photo quality is below average for this class of camera.While there are some bright spots, in my view, the lower price does not compensate for all the shortcomings of this digital camera. I ended up selling mine and got a Sony DSC-P200 instead. Superb construction (made in Japan) with all-metal body, much better quality images. It simply leaves DSCW30 in the dust. It is my understanding that DSC-P200 will soon be discontinued, so you can get a good deal if you look around the online stores or on Ebay.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "William G.

I really liked this camera at first, but then I took it on a trip with me and really put it to use, and found out it was not so great afterall.What attracted me to it first was a 6.0 megapixel camera from Sony, at only $300 CAD, and of course, it's gorgeous.Some pros: cheaper, beautiful, lightweight, compact, long battery life, fast start up time and the time it takes pictures, very clear outdoor pictures when you do not use flash on a nice day, fairly easy to use, video with sound, the LCD screen size is good enough, has a viewfinder.Cons: My night time pictures are useless. Well not useless, but they just aren't very good. I don't think the flash is powerful enough. Indoor ones don't look too good either, they're okay, but definitely not as good as a normal film camera would do.-I've only had this camera for 2-3 months, and my buttons are fading and one part is chipping.-There's not enough picture modes to choose from (snow, beach..etc).-The part where you plug in the cord to upload pictures on your computer is very cheaply made. I'm sure it will snap off soon.-The cd it comes with to store your pictures sucks. I think that's all you do, just store your pictures on a calendar. My Olympus camera come with a cd that let me edit my pictures!Overall the camera is okay. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though. I'm still going to use it, but it's unfortunate because I bought this camera and thought it would be my last one I'd ever need. I thought a 6.0 would be good enough (I had an Olympus 4.0, and Canon 5.0 previously) for life, and it probably is, but just not this one. I wish I shopped around a bit more, and I'll probably end up buying another one in a couple of years.Get it if you want a stylish, lightweight camera, that is a good price, and takes decent pictures.", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT !!", "Author": "J.

Eventhough it's a bit \"flimsy feeling\" because of the plastic case, it seemed to work relatively well for the 20 shots I took.  Why 20?  Well, i quickly found the \"deal-killer\"...The shutter-sync speed for the flash appears to default to 1/40.  This is ridiculous!  1/60 is the usual.  1/40 means even with the flash things outside of the flash range will be blurred if they're moving (or you move).  Even at 38mm, I had noticeable blurring in the background (and I have steady hands).  Even if the subject IN range of the flash moved enough I could see blurring.  This is absurd.  I played with several different settings and didn't see the flash move higher than 1/50.  STILL too low imho, especially when that was with a higher ISO (i.e. more noise).I gave it 2 stars because it works reltively well *without flash*.

Looking at the other reviews, I realized that the people who were disappointed were the people who wanted more than a point and shoot.If you just want to take pictures of your friends and good times, this is a GREAT camera. You have to hold it steady, like any other camera, and the flash can be a little bright, but that's easily adjusted with all the special features it has. It's incredibly easy to use, you barely even need the instruction manuel - especially if you've had a digital camera before - and I think that it's a fantastic price for what it is.A couple other reviewers mentioned the size being a problem for keeping it in their pocket, maybe it's just because I had an older Sony digital but this thing is tiny!

I took vewry good care of it and was happy with it for three years. Then problems began with the lens and zoom. Lens went in and out on it own, locked, using the zoom caused camera power to shut down. Did everything possible for fix--nothing worked. Checked online and youtube, and found many others were having the same problem and no fix for it. One person even shipped it back to Sony and they mailed it back to him saying they could not fix it.  took the camera completely apart, cleaned it, made sure gears were not stripped, damaged, and moved freely. So I determined the motor-like part connected to the  gear, or something in the electronic circuit went bad. It's better to purchase something else that has already gone through its technical problems and manufacturer has resolved. But this particular Sony Cyber-Shot is not one of them. You also won't find it sold at any walk-in retail stores any longer. Those still being sold online are probably left-over cameras from the time they were discontinued years ago. Before buying any digital camera, first check online and on youtube to see what problems current and previous owners have encountered. This will help you make a more informed discision before spending your hard earned money. But this particilar camera Sont Cyber-Shot Model is definitely not worth the price being asked, or even half that price.
