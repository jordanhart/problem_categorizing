{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So Far .. Very happy with the 850", "Author": "Stacey Tomoda", "ReviewID": "R2FTH8G6I9R3QH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera based on the reviews of the previous Olympus 830 model from Amazon, Consumer Reports, & various others sites being generally positive.  There was no single water camera ( in the price range I wanted to pay) that had perfect reviews so I focused on finding, what I thought, was the camera with the fewest negative reviews & the 830 seemed to be the best choice but then the 850 just came out ...so I rolled the dice with newer 850 model.I'm not a camera pro  - just wanted a camera to take beach, snorkeling, swimming/pool,& camping trip photos.  I received the camera the day before a spring break trip & it got a lot of usage.  It was easy to use, had so many settings to capture a variety of different shots, & most importantly - took great photos.  The colors were vibrant, clear, & focused.  The snorkeling photos took a couple adjustments based on the lighting but once I was able to figure that out, pictures were very good.  I'm fine with some of snorkeling pictures not turning out that great due to me moving, the fish moving, or the light not being right but the majority were great.  I just kept taking a lot of pictures til I found the best way to capture the shot.  The flip screen was cool, not used a lot, but was great for taking the underwater selfie or odd angle shot.  It worked great taking zip lining pictures with fast moving targets in the sports mode and it also worked for taking just general pictures.I saw reviews of some other underwater camera having issues with leaks & this was a major concern for me being it's an underwater camera.  No issues with this one so far  - I'll post back if I do.  Overall - camera worked great & very happy with the 850", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything I expected", "Author": "MC J.C. \"Photographical Luddite\"", "ReviewID": "R3D6T3LEQZVKKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own many cameras. In buying the TG-850 I hoped to get a \"go everywhere\" point-and-shoot that would do the same job as the Olympus Stylus Epic and Olympus XA 35mm cameras I've carried in the past.  While I haven't snorkeled or gone kayaking in years I wanted a camera that I could confidently take with me while cycling without too much concern about exposure to the elements.Something I think many people don't realize with \"underwater\" cameras is the level of care necessary to keep them functioning as such.  Despite the fact that these modern digital \"life-proof\" cameras have only one sealed door for battery, media and I/O ports that is still their achilles heel. Any microscopic grain of sand or even a human hair can be enough to defeat the seal thus flooding one's camera with water; in the case of salt water the threat is even greater since it takes only a bit of moisture to completely foul the circuitry permanently.  Since I am generally using this camera on dry land please view my review in that context.Before buying this camera I compared it to the Fuji XP-200 (only had 1080i video, good but not great) the Sony TX-30 (touch screen only? yuck) the Olympus TG-630 (well reviewed, but hey there's one with a higher model number!!) and the Panasonic, the name of which escapes me at the moment.  The TG-850 had 2 deal-breaking features that set it apart - the tilting LCD screen and the wide-angle zoom lens (a 21mm equivalent). These two features are excellent in tandem, if you've never used an articulated screen on a camera I suggest you try it, you'll find that you're able to get angles and compositions previously impossible.  Since lens allows \"zooming-out\" to an ultra-wide angle you can shoot from a truly unique perspective.As with all tiny point-and-shoots low light performance leaves something to be desired. I really wish that instead of trying to jam 16 million pixels on to a 1/2.3\" sensor they'd work on making a low-noise 6MP model. As it is there is quite a bit of detail and accurate color reproduction, but if you view your images at 100% you will see the \"smudging\" effect typical of these cameras.  The macro mode works well and flash metering is excellent, even close-up when taking \"selfies\" with the screen flipped up.  My only real disappointment with this camera was that the ubiquitous \"snap-sort\" which ranks so highly on Google when the camera is searched insists that this camera has an external mic port - I've yet to find one and there is none mentioned in the manual.This is a good buy, I'd say it could replace all but the most \"pro-sumer\" of point-and-shoots. It's not as quick as my X100s or D600 but like the old saying goes \"the best camera is the one you have with you\" and a truly durable and compact camera such as this is sure to be with you all the time.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "A. Newbury \"A. Newbury\"", "ReviewID": "R3B24XOGDN94B6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this camera a few days ago so I don't have a lot of experience with it, but I can say this:For the price point, this is a great addition to our camera collection and I've been very happy with it so far.  We appreciate picture quality and also own a DSLR, but because it's so expensive we're afraid to take it along on most of our vacations.  So, after days of research we chose the TG-850 as a solid point-and-shoot that we're not afraid to get dirty, or wet.  It was a little risky as a brand new model, so we based our decision on the earlier model and so far I have no complaints.  It has the flexibility of other point-and-shoots with different scene settings (including some specifically for water and snow!), decent zoom, ability to record video, and while not exactly tiny, it easily fits in a large pocket or small bag.  I especially appreciated the action setting (I have a toddler!), and the ability to take a burst of continuous shots at hi-speed. So far the only water shots I've taken were at a water park, so it hasn't been submerged for long lengths of time but it was dunked, splashed, and banged against concrete repeatedly for several hours and appears to have survived without a scratch.  As expected, the picture quality is not as high as our other camera, but it's still very good and all of my 4x6 prints look great.  Battery life lasted through a day and a half of constant shots, next time I will definitely recharge overnight before the next day of vacation so it doesn't run out on me.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with our decision to purchase this camera and now we have a ton of fun vacation photos that we would not have otherwise.Tip:  Waterproof cameras are finicky things, as electronics and water generally do not mix well. In doing our research, we found that ALL of the \"waterproof\" cameras in this price point had a small percentage of negative reviews regarding failing in water (10%-25% depending on brand), so I was careful to put it on a specific credit card that offers an extended warranty on my purchases.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "slsak", "ReviewID": "RZ4A301CA8N0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the 850 for my trip to Mexico that involved a lot of beach/snorkling.

I've had it for about two weeks and its worked great so far.  I bought this camera while I was there as my Olympus stylus 790sw suddenly stopped working while taking photos of my family in the water.  I'm a bit nervous about the flip screen on the TG-850 and don't really see the need for it.  However the few hundred photos and short videos I have taken with it so far, have been flawless.  The quality of both the photos and videos are very good.  I have a time share in Florida that we go to every year.  I also like the ease of use as my wife likes more basic features.Now the 790sw is about 7-8 years old and I've taken thousands of photos with it in fresh and salt water.  I watched the LCD go out on it.  Later that night I pulled the card and battery and found water on them.  I thought 7 years of dry and wet photography was a great run.  This is why I stayed with Olympus.I want to add that as I write this I was looking over my 790sw.  Remember the screen that died due to water seeping in?  I'm happy to report that after letting it sit; amazingly the camera seems to be working (in a dry state or course) like it was before.  I plan to look into getting the seals changed out and maybe handing it on to a family member now that I have a new one.Bottom line is that I will always have Olympus as my waterproof camera.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "How does this happen?", "Author": "Andrew N Booher", "ReviewID": "RLR1OG8TAMZJU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm not one to usually have anything negative to say, but add me to the list of those experiencing button issues on first time use. I purchased this product to replace another Olympus WP camera that gave good service for two years, and then one side of the zoom button quit functioning. So maybe I should have been leery, but I was intrigued by the wide angle.I was very pleased with the camera when I tested it and set it up, although the size was a little larger than I anticipated. But then the very first time I took the camera to the water park (the exact way I had used the previous camera many times) all buttons ceased to function except the shutter button. At first just the zoom button ceased to function, which was concerning, but everything else was functioning. But then the rest of the buttons quit working, and nothing I could do would restore function.Later that day I tried again and to my surprise everything was functioning again. But since I was getting close to the 30 day return period I just returned it and got a refund. I will say that Amazon handled the return effortlessly. But how disappointing to have a brand new product fail in the exact environment you purchased it for, and to see that the problem seems to be common. Hate to lose out on the wide angle lens, but I'm not willing to take a chance on it again. Bummer.

It was all dancing bars and white noise.  When the replacement came, I took some pictures with it, learned the functions, and was liking it a lot.  It takes great pictures!  And then I took it on vacation to Cancun  (the reason I bought it).  And on day 2 the LCD screen started doing the exact same thing - cutting in & out,  dancing bars . . .  so water got into the hinge?  or it's just a bad hinge?  The first one never touched water.  The 2nd one did, but I had not opened the secured compartment at all since I initially charged it and put in the SD card.So . . .  In my opinion it has an inherent bad design on the hinged LCD screen  (possibly not even related to water usage???).  I just squeaked in under Amazon's 30 day return policy and after the 2nd one am not willing to take a chance on a 3rd camera lasting a little longer and then forcing me to deal with olympus customer support.  So, my current strategy is to wait until just before my next planned beach vacation and try another brand of waterproof camera.  And if it fails then I'll be within the 30 day window and return it and will be done with waterproof cameras.On the plus side, it did appear to still work for a while (made the shutter noise) so I was still taking pictures during the visit to Xel-Ha.  On the minus side, I couldn't see what I was doing really or change any settings and 1/2 through it stopped making the shutter noise and without an LCD screen couldn't tell what might be wrong.  Just got back and it turned out the card was full but I did get a few usable pictures of part of the day.  None of the amazing fish we saw while snorkeling though.

I was interested in a rugged camera without GPS, WiFi, altimeter, compass and other futilities.My 10y-old son is using a Tough 3000 and my 8y-old got a TG-820 for Christmas. I pre-ordered the 850 in January because of its two good features: 21mm and tilt-screen. I received it end of March . The next day I returned it.First disappointment is the feeling. Although the camera looks nice, the black sides are not rubber but hard plastic.Second is the ergonomics: Have the Olympus engineers taken pix with gloves or cold fingers ? They put the three buttons in line on-off / shutter / W-T zoom right next to each other. I'm 100% sure you will hit the zoom when you want to press  the shutter or you will take a pix when you need zooming.Third is the image quality: I always take a topographic map as test. Ten shoots between 21mm@ 3.5 and 105mm@5.7.It's never crispy, it's ok in the center, bad on the corners. Hard to believe there are 16 MP. On my 27\" iMac, 800 ISO is the limit of acceptable quality.Fourth is the 460k screen. Like the TG-830, it's a step back with the 920k on the TG-820.So still three stars for this camera because the AF is excellent, it is well build, the macro mode is pleasant. Maybe the climbers will appreciate the 5-axis stab for video (although they will choose a GoPro).I paid $189 for a the TG-820 five months ago. Now it's almost $300.
