{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great", "Author": "J. Tanaka", "ReviewID": "R1L8CJ6ZZDD3L1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No hardware problems so far but I had it only for a week. Install was pretty easy. Just note that this DVR unit does not come with cameras. I also bought the 4ch for my parents and that one came with cameras. Also note that this unit does not have a power splitter so you need to use the power adapters that come with the cameras. If this unit came with a splitter built in you wouldn't need to make space for 8 power adapters. Make sure you have a big enough surge protector as you will need 9 outlets. The video comes out good with my 32\" LCD tv. You can display all 8 cameras at once or 4 and then it will flip to the other 4. you can also display one camera at a time. when you buy cameras make sure you buy one with night vision that can reach far. i got the 30ft and 80ft. the 80 ft comes out much better. but the way i set it up is that the 30ft is next to motion sensor flood lights. when the lights turn on the video comes out great. the 80ft reaches all the way across the street to my neighbors garage. so essentially the better your camera the better the video. oh i used a 1tb seagate sata HD. i will be installing more for backup and to extend the length of recording. just install it and format it with the unit and off you go. another thing before i forget, i also used 100ft extension video/power cable. the video still comes out great. i didnt get the q-see brand as that had bad reviews. i did however had to get female to female bnc adapters to connect the extension cables. the ones that come with them is not the right type. i got them from radioshack for around $3.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "it was as advertised", "Author": "glenn black", "ReviewID": "R19Z1ZXS8SDNKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this product was properly advertised and the unit worked exactly as describedi would reccomend this selller in the future", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000WUQ5XO"}}
