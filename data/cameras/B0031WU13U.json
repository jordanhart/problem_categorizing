{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good Value For The Money", "Author": "Pechmerle", "ReviewID": "R348PWIH9HBB2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the modest price, you get a quite decent camera.  It weighs about 4 ounces, so it is very easy to carry around (in a pocket, a purse or bag, a case attached to your belt, whatever).  It's a bit thicker than the Casio super-compact credit-card cameras.Like all the very compact Casio's, its control buttons on the back panel are quite small.  If you have big fingers, you probably won't like those controls.The camera has a very good assortment of scene mode choices, from \"landscape\" to \"food.\"  There are no truly manual controls.  But you can compensate for that by making some setting choices, and be set up for the type of photo you are most likely to want to take.  I bought this camera for my wife (a certified non-photographer who wanted something to take on trips).  So, I set the ASA to 400 and a few other things.  This turned it into a truly point and shoot for her:  she could just turn it on and shoot anything in the daytime, have an adequate shutter speed, etc.  She never changed the scene mode on a ten day trip last summer, and didn't feel frustrated by that.  On the other hand, if she ever does get motivated to learn a little more, the scene mode choices are there.The camera uses a rechargeable mini lithium ion battery, rather than AA's (whether disposable or rechargeable).  I like this better, because AA's get expensive if you use them up, and are really expensive abroad.  The battery's charger is external, but is quite light and fairly small.  And you can use the charger in other countries.  It works in Europe; you just need a simple, inexpensive round-plug adapter (non-electronic, just for the shape) between its plug and a wall socket.All in all, good for what it is.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheap price, cheaply made", "Author": "Kristen Broussard \"GlutenFreeDiabticPumper\"", "ReviewID": "R3JJ85S643DU9Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as I thought it was a great price and I loved the color.  I was even happier with the color when it arrived...it is not a true purple.  It is more a fuchsia pink/purple.  It had some cool camera settings but they always didnt work out well as the ones with a flash, the flash was to bright and made the pictures white out and the non flash ones were too dark.  The camera also had a slow recovery time...so if you missed the perfect shot the opportunity was gone as it took a few seconds before you were able to take the next picture.  The main body of the camera seemed sturdy, but the battery door was a cheap flimsy plastic and seemed like it would snap off easily.  The battery door also did not like to stay shut.  Every time I turned around the darn thing was poped open again.  It was hard to get it to shut again...and would only stay a little bit.  Overall there are many better camera's for less than 100 bucks.

So even though it's a great deal for a 12.1 MP camera that can shoot Youtube videos, you really aren't getting much. It doesn't come with all the \"extras\" that some of the other camers have. But it takes great pictures and video quality is pretty good in the right light. In low light situations the video looks grainy. but still better than most. I'm giving this a four star because of the price and the customer service that Casio has. I haven't had a problem with this camera but i have needed to call Casio's customer service before and well, they are pretty good and there isn't a whole lot of waiting on hold to talk to a person.So remember, for the price AWESOME camera, but you get what you pay for so don't go thinking that it is going to do what the $250 and $400 point-and-shoot cameras do.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice n easy", "Author": "ARIS", "ReviewID": "R1FPBRNISKPRLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i really like this camera it was so simple to use. its small size made traveling with it very easy. i found that the camera is also pretty durable as i fell while holding it and banged it into the ground and it only was scratched up and still worked perfectly fine", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent design with all the basic options & HD", "Author": "AenJailies", "ReviewID": "R5O32RAXP8C76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes very good pictures, has a super quiet video zoom and HD recording option along with youtube.The HD option is not advertised for this camera.

While it has 12mp, it lacks any shutter speed and 80% or more of photos are somewhat to extremely blurry.  The menu is complicated and limited in choices.  Battery is not compatible with other Casio cameras.  Fair first time camera, but not dependable for quality.I purchased this model of Casio as a graduation gift for a friend.  It was actually a replacement for a Casio EX-Z80 which was damaged by airport baggage handlers.  The Z35 has a smaller screen, slower shutter speed, and is made composed of plastic whereas the later model was scratch resistant aluminum.

The menus are so easy you don't even have to read the instructions (but I recommend it anyway). Tye body is solid and it's design is nice. The viewing screen is large, sharp and easy to see. The flash is powerful, so much that you'll have to back people off and use the zoom otherwise they may appear too bright and washed-out.

Flash forward a little over a year and we still have the thing. We've read the manual, we've looked online, we've messed around with it endlessly, but it's just super fickle. Sometimes the pictures come out great, and sometimes they're REALLY blurry. It has a feature where the little red marks on the screen turns green when it's focused if you hold the button 1/2 way down. Ours NEVER focuses. Sure, we get lucky occasionally, but really, who wants a camera that you can't rely on?! I actaully never even use it anymore since I got my Samsung Focus phone. Believe it or not, the phone is more reliable and takes better pictures.The zoom button has also been sticking when you try to zoom in or out.I consider myseld a fairly competent person, but I just can't figure out why this thing won't work, other than it's just a piece of junk.We're looking for a new camera for a trip because we can't rely on this one.
