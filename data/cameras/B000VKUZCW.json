Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R2Z3GEOTENVM0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been toying with the idea of getting a digital for years but I wasn't sold on the picture quality, (without spending a great deal of money) and I'm frankly a film snob. I have a vintage Fuji SLR and a Canon Photura which both produce great shots but are cumbersome to chase the kids around with. I wanted something easy to set, with minimal buttons so my kids could use it as well, but with a quality worth printing at least a 5x7 with. The specs are well detailed in the description so I'll just go general. I found the camera very intuitive. I haven't looked at the manual but all the modes are easy to figure out by the 'press a button and see what happens' method. Editing on the fly is quick and easy, the video I took looks as good as a minidv tape, the pictures blow up well. It fits in my front jean pocket or in a small matching Samsonite hardcase I found for $4. With a 2 GB card I can do 30 minutes of video or about a thousand pictures. This camera is advertised as long life batteries and so far I've done about 200 photos and 15 minutes of video on the supplied batteries. One negative is the shutter time - when using flash mode it is s-l-o-w. You can't catch something quickly, you're going to get three or five seconds after you think you are. However, turning the flash off made this shutter as fast as my Photura, (if not as fast as my SLR) but still had a lag time between shots. It's a trade I can live with since the multiple exposure settings make it easy to compensate for not using the flash. The design is excellent. I'm left handed and a lot of things designed for one handed use annoy me by placing buttons where a left handed user will hit the wrong ones. Although there are three buttons on the top of the camera, I had no problem at all with this. The kids are very interested in the stop motion feature. While I got this as a snap shot camera for my own use, it would be an excellent choice for an 8 year old's first camera. I spent a long time (about a year) choosing between a Nikon, Canon or Kodak model. I think the Nikon was the right way to go for ease of use, results, and visual styling. Couldn't be happier with it.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is an awesome camera just need to know how to use it", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R16J0JGNR6NT5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago. I was very skeptic about it but i gave nikon another try.I had an old 2.5MP from nikon I loved, so i bought the Nikon L1 and hated it to death it was garbage - slow, worthless video and so on.I returned it and purchased the canon with 6MP..it was nice but i still missed the old nikon.After going back and forth i decided i give nikon another try - i love it !The Nikon is quick even with Flash but you need to know which setting you need for what type of pictures.I work in a daycare and tokk pictures of kids today i caught them in the position i pressed the shutter...awesome.Took a picture of my daughter playing with water and you can even see the single water drops when she splashed.the macro is awesome - you can see every single detailIt has a little shutter lag when you take pictures in low lightalso when you just to far away and the object is moving. but thats ok.you can however adjust this yourself and yes after reading the manual you can take awesome pics and FAST !!!The video quality is like TV or DVD...i have an samsung camcorder 8mm tape and the nikon takes better quality video..and my camcorder is only 2 years old.You can use up to 4GB SD Cards and the battery life is long.I took at least 1 hour of Video and maked the rest of my 4GB out with Pictures and I am still on the Batteries that came with the camera...If you just want to take some camera out of the box and shootthis might not be the one but if you dont mind going through the manual for 30 min, so you know what you doing you will get rewarded withawesome pictures, awesome video and of course a reliable brand with little costs.I am back with Nikon and i love it !!!All i can say this camera has no negative side effects for me since i went throught the manual and know what i'm doing and yes i am not a geek or anything like that, just a mom and a daycare provider and i was able to manage it.if you want a real good camera for lessthis is the one, is not only small and handy but very light.It can easy fit in a pocket and no one would know.and besides that it looks nice and shiny,BTW you can see the display in direct sunlight.I am still discovering the camera and with each day I love it more!", "Date": "December 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Elegant, easy-to-use digital cam that takes EXCELLENT pics!", "Author": "CQ DX", "ReviewID": "R2ZPDS235IXV8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying that this is a GREAT, maximum bang-per-buck 'point-and-shoot' compact digital camera. I conducted a LOT of research before I decided on the 'Coolpix L14', and it is one of my best purchases ever. I've been using an old Fujifilm 'Finepix 2650' (2 megapixel) for a few years now, and it's served me well. I wanted a more compact, simple to use and intuitive brand-name (like Nikon, Canon, Sony, etc.) digital cam that took high quality pictures in 'auto mode', and still had some advanced features and options that I could use in a 'manual mode' for even more control of the shot. I also wanted a camera that would use both 'AA' batteries, and high-capacity rechargeable 'AA' batteries, if I so choose. This camera takes both, and the batteries last a lot longer than many other cameras that I researched (Nikon claims about 1,000 shots with 'Energizer e2' lithium batteries), owned, or borrowed. The LCD screen looks sharp and crisp as well, and I like the 'face finding' and 'red eye fix' technology too, and they both work quite well. In addition, I tested it's video abilities as well, and the audio/video look and sound seamless, although you really need to get a 2GB card to get any meaningful length video out of this cam. The pic transfer software also works perfectly with my Windows XP PC, with no glitches. In summation, for the price, this cam is a truly GREAT buy, and it looks GORGEOUS in blue too (classy, expensive look)!

Almost every picture I took was blurry.  Outdoors it takes fairly decent shots, but indoors it is extremely finicky.  I poured over the manual and tried every combination of settings, but I could not get the camera to take consistently clean pictures.  The action settings seemed to have no effect.  Just taking a still photograph indoors with the flash usually came out blurry.  The manual even warns not to press the button too hard, saying otherwise pictures could come out blurry. (!)  With the flash was always better than without, but at no point could the pics hold up against a family member's Olympus FE 180.  Worse still was how slow the camera responded, taking 3-7 seconds to save a picture.

But getting into this camera more now I find that I'm carrying it everywhere as it's pocket sized, and taking pictures all over the place.  But to get the best you need to use the programmes - there's 5 settings for pictures and 5 for white balance.  The settings bring the best out of daylight photos or indoor electic light pictures.  The picture programmes get the camera set up for automatically getting the right settings for a portrait or a landscape.  The camera takes it's best pictures in good lighting and without or not much of the 3x zoom.  Low light is difficult, even with the flash it's not great - just OK - same as any inexpensive digital camera - not great, just keep it real steady.  But at this price, what do you expect from a quality manufacturer like Nikon (- a press camera at a disposable price?  Not going to happen is it?)  Take a look at the photos I've put on the UK Amazon site with my UK review of the Nikon L14.Given it's price and the pretty good photos I've taken once I got used to it, I think it deserves somewhere between 3+ and 4.Update - Well in the end I sent it back to Nikon to have the focusing sorted - it came back a couple of weeks later a Little better so I gueaa this is the best it can get.  Anyway at the price it's not too bad - it's the least expensive of all the cameras we have in my family", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware of this camera", "Author": "Mark A Bolton", "ReviewID": "R3EVFHLARHIYFW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate to say this, but I own three of these cameras.  I was attracted to them because of the long battery life, for I take a lot of pictures, and have two employees that also take lots of pictures of our work.  I wish I would have tested the first one out more before I bought two more of them.  You see, one camera on its FIRST day of use crapped out with a lens error, rendering it useless.  After doing a search on the net about the Nikon L14 lens error, I come to find out it's very common.  I had no idea how common, until it happened to the 2nd one, this one only have about a week's use on it.  I did send the first one back to Nikon and it is covered under a one year warranty.  I'm sure they'll cover the 2nd one, but I have no idea if the camera will actually be fixed to not happen again, or if this is what I'm in for.  If so, you can count on one year's worth of use out of these cameras.  After the warranty runs out, I doubt that it would be worthwhile to pay to ship them and pay to have them repaired.  I'm really disgusted by all this.  I always thought Nikon was a quality product.  When two out of three fail, that's a bad sign.  I'll start using the third one and see how far we get with this one.  I thought to just resell them on ebay after they return from repair, but I can't do that to someone.  I wish Nikon would give me my money back on those pieces of junk and take them off the market, because they are bad news.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera very satisfied", "Author": "R.

In my opinion, Nikon and Panasonic have the best design on point and shoots because you can put your thumb on the back of the camera and hold it securely without fear of hitting other buttons.

I used it a total of 5 times before the battery ran out, which is pretty good for me since I take a lot of pictures.  My problem was that the lens did not retract when the battery died, so I put the camera in my purse.  When I bought the batteries and placed them in the camera it resulted in a \"Lens Error\".  I noticed that the lens was a little crooked and so it wouldn't retract.  Thank goodness I had brought another camera with me on my trip otherwise I would have been highly disappointed.When I return to my trip I sent my damaged Nikon to the customer repair center thinking that it would be covered under warranty.  To my disbelief I received a bill in the mail 10 days later saying that it would cost $107 to repair my camera (MORE than the camera cost itself) because the damage was not covered under warranty.  I called the repair center and they notified me that it appeared as though the bent lens was due to impact, which was NOT the case.  I advised them of that fact and they said I could file a dispute.

The photos it takes are, to be honest, not up to snuff.  This camera actually takes worse photos than most 2 megapixel and 3 megapixel cameras that were out 4 years ago.  Give no thought to the fact that it's a 7 megapixel camera.  It just means you get 7 megapixels of a poor photo.  Maybe it's the lens, but in all honesty, my wife's new Samsung Cell Phone takes photos as well as this disappointment does.We purchased this Nikon because my wife has had good experiences with her Nikon Coolpix 5900.  That camera is a few years old, and was three times the price, but we feel we got \"taken\" by trusting the Nikon name on this.I will say that it does take decent close-up shots.  Anything in the mid-range, however, is generally blurry or out of focus 50% of the time.  Honestly, to look at the photos, we can't figure out what the camera was trying to focus on, either.  Nothing at a medium range looks good.  Long-distance shots are quite ho-hum.The PC mode is, strangely, somewhat useful.  Anything in between that and the highest 7 megapixel mode should be avoided.  We feel we need to take photos on the highest setting at all times in order to get a photo that is at least acceptable.In all honesty, you should avoid this camera.  I know it's cheap, but for the price, there has got to be something better.  There's no point in a camera being \"easy to use\" if it takes awful photos.I have no hatred of Nikon.

No problem, we figured, send it back for a warranty repair.  Wrong.  Nikon claims it was dropped (no dings on the camera, I was using it when it stopped working so I know it wasn't dropped, child was always supervised when using it so I know SHE didn't drop it).  They refused to repair it.  It works sporadically, still takes good photos when the lens decides to open.  My opinion is that since it's their \"value\" line, you get what you pay for.  It's disappointing, because my family has used Nikon products for over 50 years (including professionally) and has always been pleased with the quality and service.  Is this the new Nikon?  I will think twice before purchasing another Nikon product.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Piece of junk ,,,, and I love nikon products !!!", "Author": "Peter A.

Apparently I didn't do enough research when I selected the Nikon Coolpix L14.  This camera made me think twice about the supposedly top brand of cameras.  In the two years I've had this camera, I've sent it to the repair center twice for the lens becoming off track.  It's not that I didn't take good care of it.  Sometimes when I turned it on, the lens does not open right - \"lens error\" showed up too often.  If that didn't make me hate this camera, it was the picture quality that did.  I hated asking other people to take a picture for me because they don't understand that whole face detection and anti shake setting.  Basically you have to press a button to activate this setting, hold down the picture button for a couple seconds, allow it to focus on the subject for another few seconds and then take the picture.  Without doing this, portrait pictures come out blurry.  What a waist of time!  Also the shutter speed is annoyingly slow.  My final complaint is a general complaint about all digital cameras - battery life.  Even the Energizer Digital Camera batteries did not last more than a day or two of vacation picture taking.  My boyfriend and his mother also have the same camera with the same problems.  So, no, it's not just me with these complaints.  I suppose if you are looking for a camera with advanced complicated settings, this might be a good prospect.  Yet, all I wanted was a nice point and shoot camera for everyday use.  My sister recently bought the Casio Exilim camera.  I was hesitant at first because I've always seen Casio as a cheap quality brand.  In no time I was borrowing her camera and I just recently bought one myself!  The shutter speed is fast, I love the rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the picture quality is amazing and best of all no blurry pictures!!", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix camera", "Author": "C.

Presumably, they were very similar to the previous models, but hey, they used a NEW processor, and new is better, right? And look, they come in cool colors! I like the blue! So I ordered one and was quite disappointed. Comparing my photos to the many L10,11,12 sample photos available on the websites, the photos from this camera have much more pronounced noise indoors. This is due to the camera choosing a high ISO setting, and you cannot control it. The photos from this camera have strange defects, like a fringe, that comes off high contrast subjects. Example: I took an outdoor photo which included a Panera Bread sign, white letters with thick black outline. The white center of the letters was washing off into the black outline. This is not noticable in the center of the picture, but anywhere outside the central 1/3,  it gets worse, and is worst at the edges and of course the corners. As a result of this, the whole photo has a slightly out of focus quality to it. The clincher for me was when I did a side by side shoot-off between my 5 yr old 3MP Canon compact and this New Nikon L14 7MP. The Old Canon won! I returned the L14. I really liked the blue.Dec 7 update: Just received the L12 I ordered as a replacement. A world of difference! Sharp edges, no fringe or smearing, less pixel noise, focus acceptable out to the edges.
