{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent travel camera, but WiFi is of questionable value", "Author": "Jerry Jackson Jr.", "ReviewID": "R29GDNMCP21JCJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's hard to find fault with the TZ50 as a basic compact ultrazoom camera. The T50 offers all the performance and flexibility of the excellent TZ5, which is certainly why many consumers will find it so appealing. Sure, Panasonic could have made the TZ50 a much more useful photographic tool by including basic features like P/A/S/M modes, but the reality is that most point-and-shoot users won't miss these features. The new WiFi upload feature is sure to be attractive to many consumers looking to quickly share their vacation photos. Nevertheless, it's hard to overwhelmingly recommend the TZ50 over the TZ5.When everything is said and done, although the TZ50 allows you to wirelessly upload your images to your Picasa web gallery the process isn't nearly as easy as it might sound. Since the TZ5 can be purchased for a full $100 less than the TZ50, I suspect most average consumers will be happier uploading images the \"old fashioned way\" directly from their desktop or laptop computers rather than stumbling through the clunky WiFi interface on the TZ50.If the WiFi mode setup doesn't scare you, though, the TZ50 makes an excellent choice for anyone who wants an ultrazoom camera and wants to quickly share photos while traveling.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great value, great zoom, great features, good video, good photos", "Author": "TonyCool", "ReviewID": "R2914OCZC97J60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very satisfied with this camera. It's loaded with features.While you will find on expert reviews that the manual control is poor, it's not that bad, in the manual mode you can even modify the shutter speed and the exposure (better than most ELPH Canon cameras, you will have to choose on a limited set of options for this though).It takes better pictures than what I was specting (they are not as sharp as they could be because of the Panasonic approach to handle noise reduction, but they are good), and the video is also really good (the audio recording is not perfect but what were you specting this is not a professional camcoder.)It records really good video but it requires lots of space a 15 min video will need about 1.5 - 2 GB of storage), the zoom is pretty awesome its 10x but if you need a little more power you can take 3MP photos with a 16.9x zoom, and the digital zoom is not as bad as I thought. The wireless capabilities are a plus and just in case you were wondering as I was before, you do not need to use the Tmobile service if you don't want to, you can configure internet access through your own access point. The high definition LCD is really good. It also takes good pictures without flash.From my point of view right now (July 27 2008) there is not a competitor for this camera, the tx1 is not a rival for this one. The only thing I can think of that will improve this camera enormously will be to make the LCD movable (to take pictures on difficult angles or self portraits like the tx1). And this is still a compact camera although it may not fit in some pockets you can take it anywhere easily.As a conclusion you will not regret buying this one.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Splendid Compact Digital Camera Courtesy of Panasonic and Leica", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "R3V0ZGYABLPJDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5OS 9.1 Megapixel digital camera is truly in a class by itself. It is the best compact digital camera I have seen so far, and strongly recommended it to a relative. My relative is enjoying hers now, and I have been quite impressed with the results. This camera performs superbly under both bright and low light conditions without a flash, certainly an impressive result for a camera as small and compact as this. Pictures have ample contrast and resolution, though tending slightly to the warm side. While she hasn't tried the HD video application yet, I wouldn't be surprised if the contrast and resolution is identical with still pictures. Without question, the Leica zoom lens is a fine performer and is a primary reason why you ought to buy this camera. Without indulging too much in hype, I can say with utmost certainty that Panasonic and Leica have hit a home run with this splendid little camera.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "OIS...Wide Angle...Wireless...It's All an Incredible Value!", "Author": "J. Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R34T56E1WLD2I2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love everything about this camera. It's my first upgrade since my two megapixel Sony MVC-CD250, but I don't get this excited about a camera without a good reason and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ50S is everything I could want in a compact camera and so much more.You get more than just 802.11 b/g wireless connectivity for your extra camera buck with this jewel! You get a few more picture formats over the non-wireless model in some of the zoom ranges and you also get twice as much internal built-in memory, too.This camera takes beautiful pictures. The OIS (Optical Image Stabilized) Zoom is a huge deal with any camera, and this one utilizes it with two options.Features are plentiful and quite innovative. Selective playback and delete options which utilize favorites. Picture classification by type. So much stuff works together. I even dig the musical options for the slideshow playback, too...an entertaining bonus! There are travel features and LCD viewing angle options...there are just too many features to repeat in a reasonably sized review.I have yet to use the wireless feature, but I plan to check it out. That's not to say someone with lot's of (or any) distant, web-surfing relatives to share pictures with wouldn't benefit tremendously from this feature set. I read the wireless manual - yes, its own little bonus manual - and it totally makes sense, and I can see the value in this innovation as well.I'm absolutely, completely pleased with the feature set, performance, versatility and everything else about this camera.It saves photos in .jpeg format.Oh! And the multiple-quality movie modes, including hi-def, are phenomenal. Audio is just typical, as it should be with a camera which is meant for photos.I totally recommend the Panasonic DMC-TZ50S to anyone interested in a compact point and shoot (but so far beyond the definition) digital camera.

Despite that, I still went on and buy the TZ50.  Though this is a bit more pricy than the TZ5, I didn't find any flaws for taking indoor pictures.  Well, I didn't compare side by side with the TZ5.  At least from the pictures I took, I dont see any picture quality issues ......The best part of the camera of couse is the Zoom capability and this is the main reason I buy the TZ50.  With the 10X optical Zoom, it pretty much handle all of your picture taking needs in travel, sports, parties, wedding, etc.Cons of the camera?  1) The size is may be a bit bulky (for ladies) but to me this is OK.  The TZ50 is about the same size as my old Canon SD500.  2) Never tried the Wi-fi and not sure how useful it is.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic tmz50", "Author": "Gary A.

Panasonic can't help me because I'm from Brazil and I didn't find anything about it on google. So, I gave up.Other terrible point is the software included. They are very poor.

I was studying there and wanted to document my experience for obvious reasons!After researching for months I decided on this Panasonic model and all the accessories so I would be prepared...and it took the most beautiful pictures - while it still worked! After only a month the lens cover wouldn't open when I turned the camera on. Then my zoom went. Then the thing wouldn't even turn on. I was stuck in Italy with no camera and two months of my trip left.Luckily one of the other girls there had a spare camera I could use some of the time, but its really disappointing when you fork out all this money and your amazing camera craps out after a month of ownership. Like I said, this camera worked beautifully when it worked. I have never seen a camera take such amazing night shots. Maybe I just got a fluke model.Well, I've sent it in to be repaired so hopefully things with be resolved...but I still spent two months in Europe with no camera.
