This may me because there is less shielding around the wires and that the wires are thinner in general.The video quality was very poor in my opinion. The picture was fuzzy and grainy compare to the stock cables. Maybe you won't notice on a 400 TVL resolution system, but for our 660 TVL system, it looked pathetic. So much so that I returned two of the three cables I purchased. I only kept the one I opened since I took it out of the package. It is installed currently and there is a CLEAR DIFFERENCE in the quality.I would NOT recommend this to anyone, even for the low price.

We bought 2 of the 150' power/video/audio lines.  The power is the black connector on these, while video is yellow, and the red ones are audio.  Really cannot see a difference in video quality between the 60' and the 150' on my monitor.  We are using 5 of the 60' ones that came with the DVR and cameras; 2@150' (with audio), and a 100' one without audio connectors.  All the cameras, pigtails, connections, and audio video power cords tested well, and are still working after 2 weeks.The video/power cords must be hooked up while they are still on a machine, which has the middle of the lines held while the end connectors are being installed.  While the line is still being held by its middle, the two ends are rolled, then strapped together.  To unwind with the least problems, it is best to unroll and straighten with ALL of the connectors at the same end and the other end being the middle of the lines.  Then untwist the lines and straighten them out.  My husband showed me how and we had all 8 of the lines stretched out in around 45 minutes.  It is cool to note that the company has audio microphones that you can attached to the lines with audio connectors AND the DVR has audio inputs as well.  Haven't used them yet.  Will re-post if I ever do, to let anyone know if they record audio.  Figure I might want to invest the $12-15 to get audio if it will help me recognize a vandal.Since all of the video quality is good, but not like what they show on any TV programs or those used for giving you a ticket, I have no problems with the quality of the reception.  In other words, the quality is good, but will not allow you to read license plates or get a definite ID unless you are quite lucky.  But you will be able to tell species, quantities of those surveyed, general clothes, general stature, model of car, and that type of thing in the dark.  During the day the video is even better, with facial recognition possible.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Price for the product", "Author": "E.

You may be able to notice a quality difference on 600TVL cameras but then again if you had those you would probably have enough cash to spring for high quality cables.Included audio cable! I was very happy to get an included audio jack on the cables in case one day I wanted to upgrade my cameras I would nto have to replace the cabling.Cons: I may be a little at fault here but the cable wrapping is atrocious.

Also 150ft of thinner cable is easier to work with as opposed to thick ones. Only 2 things I didn't like was the fact that I need to completely un-roll the cable then re-roll it to make my runs because of the way it was packaged and the connector ends have very short leads meaning the connections on the DVR need to be close together.

The biggest problem I had was tangled cord.  They folded the cord in half, then wound it up as a pair of wires starting at the point of the fold.  With the first cable, I just undid the ties holding the wire in the loop, and kind of tossed the roll to unroll it.  That was a huge mistake - it took about 1/2 hour to untangle the mess.  On the second cable I took a couple of minutes and unrolled it very carefully, then rolled it back into a spool starting at one end of the cable.
