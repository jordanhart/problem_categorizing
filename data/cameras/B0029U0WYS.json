I didn't really know anything about using one, and I wasn't willing to pay over $700 for one.  I saw this camera on a Sony flier I received in my e-mail and showed the specifications to my professor.  Overall, he thought it was a pretty neat camera for it's price.So far I haven't had any problems with it, and most of my pictures have come out the way I wanted them to come out.  The A330 is very light and fits better in my hands than some other DSLR cameras I have been playing around with.  What I really love about the camera is it's help guide. For someone, like me, who has minimal DSLR experience the help guide is extremely useful.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Alpha 330", "Author": "carolegs \"carole\"", "ReviewID": "R1DT8PVUTURM0E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I very much like my Sony Alpha-330. It is easy to use, the weight is comfortable...I wish the higher ISO values created less noise in the image.I'm very happy with the image stabilization within the camera.Can't think of too much else that isn't perfect, except the noise in low-light images.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long?", "Author": "mint snow", "ReviewID": "R11T3TD63TCOAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only have one question and that is \"Why did I wait so long\"? I haven't had an SLR since my Minolta film camera many years ago. I tried a Nikon DSLR a few years ago and hated it...it was bulky, the photos were blurred and I had to edit almost every photo I took...so I sent it back disappointed. My first digital camera was a Sony Cybershot and I had great luck with it. I tried several of the high zoom Sony Cybershot digital cameras with great success. While I was very happy with my results, I knew it was time for me to move on to a DSLR. SOOOO, I decided to give the Sony Alpha 330 a try! WOW!! The photos are AMAZING!! I have taken hundreds of photos so far and have NOT had to edit one of them! I bought the kit with a 18-55mm & 55-200mm lens' and the quality of my photos has improved tenfold. The technology of Sony is beyond compare and this camera gives me razor sharp, colorful photos each time I snap the shutter. I will be adding extra lens to this camera for years of professional looking photos! And I will be adding some photos here soon in the photo section. BUY THIS...you won't be sorry. Also, I highly recommend this very helpful book by David Busch to compliment your Sony a330 called: David Busch's Sony Alpha DSLR-A380/A330/A230 Guide to Digital SLR Photography, Softcover Book, by David Busch", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great entry level DSLR", "Author": "princegc", "ReviewID": "RBEAV8PHPP5ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is excellent.  Especially for extreme close ups.  The shutter speed could be a little bit faster during sports mode.  It also requires a great deal of light in order for moving images to come out in-focus when avoiding using the flash.  Overall, however, this camera is excellent.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Enjoyable", "Author": "David J. Yang", "ReviewID": "R2UJO5MG1XSKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have been using it for over 6 months replacing my aging Canon first digital rebel. Very responsive shutter.  Tons of special effects and tricks.  Built quality is excellent, as known for Sony.  All in all not a bad camera.  Only thing missing is video.  Would recommend Canon T1i or similar with HD video capabilities.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "The product fulfilled all my expectations.", "Author": "Alejandro Tortos", "ReviewID": "R3B4K85AE7LIU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me I'm an amateur photographer, but I like to take pretty pictures, the camera fulfilled with most of my expectations.

Sony bought the moinolta camera division. The picture quality with my small sony 8mp takes better photos with the Zeiss lens than this camera does. Also, the camera is slow to take a second picture which is a problem sometimes. Standard settings which are easy to change. Takes all older Minolta lenses which was one of the reasons I bought it.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Alpha A330Y 10.2 MP Digital SLR Camera", "Author": "Robert L.
