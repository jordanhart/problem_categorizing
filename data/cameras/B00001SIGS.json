The best feature is the floppy disk storage media.  You're out of town, no laptop mega-drive and out of storage?  Buy a $5 box of disks and shoot for another  month!I bought an extra battery for mine which is real handy when  traveling.  The battery life is real good - several hours of continuous  shooting and viewing, even with the lower life battery supplied with the  camera.  These batteries also interchange with Sony video cameras, so you  can get double duty out of them if you own a video camera also.I have  used the camera to take pictures to email to family & friends, Fox  & Friends, post on auction sites, send to publications and even just to  print out on photo paper.  I used the camera on a tripod to take pictures  of kids on Santa's lap this past Christmas, printing them on photo paper  with an ink jet printer - a terrific success!  The quality was not quite  35mm SLR, but it was a whole lot better and faster than a cheap 35mm.I  am now experimenting with the mpeg video mode for our local track team,  many events are completed in less than the 1 minute limit in extended mode.  We may post these to the students web sites eventually.All my old 52mm  lense accessories  fit this camera.  The filters, effects lenses & etc.  add to the creativity you can unleash with this camera.  The ability to  instantly check your work by viewing on the screen is impossible with 35mm.  Many years ago I considered becoming a professional photographer and back  then you had to do a test shot with a Polaroid to check lighting,  composition and so on.  I believe this camera will take the place of  Polaroids in all applications.  Don't throw out the old Nikon 35 yet  though, for true quality work, you still need film.This camera also has  a whole disk or single frame copy feature that is really nice if you want  to give copies of your pictures away in the field.  You can also delete  unwanted frames to free disk space in the camera.  The controls and menus  for all these functions are intuitive and straight forward to use.Exposure control is also easily accomplished with a series of  programable features.  The shutter speed, apeture, flash and white balance  can all be set manually if you don't want to use the automatic mode, which  really is adequate for most situations.  You will want to read the book  first, but once you have the basics down, it is just infinite  experimentation from there.  You can't make a mistake - just reset and try  again - you're not wasting expensive film!I would recommend getting a  wide angle accessory lense; if you are taking pictures of large subjects in  tight quarters, (no, I'm not talking about Santa Claus!), sometimes you  can't backup far enough.  An extra battery, as mentioned above, is also  essential if you plan to use it traveling or on all day assignments.", "Date": "April 30, 2000"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Flexibility", "Author": "Dick Lutz", "ReviewID": "R1Y0568ZK95PUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I run a small newspaper.  The FD91 has become so indispensable that I now own 2.  I can lend one out to an experienced emulsion photographer and, when necessary, teach him/her the essentials of how to use it in 5-6  minutes.  These flexible features make it perfect for my situation:  The  14:1 zoom means less cropping, and therefore higher resolution in the final  cropped photo; the swivel LCD means it's easy to shoot from a higher angle  (like over heads of a crowd or from a low angle, or even around a corner;  floppy-disk media means film is essentially unlimited, or limited only to  roughly 8x the number of disks I'm willing to carry, and they're cheap so  \"film cost\" is never a problem.  Finally, of course, in a  newspaper operation there are the digital camera advantages of immediate  availability, unlimited no-cost shooting because there are no one-time film  or processing costs.  As to resolution, the 1024x768 size means that a  landscape shot can be printed as wide as 12 inches in an 85-line screen  without apparent loss of resolution.  (But because this camera is so  oustanding, I've now purchased a third Mavica, the FD95, for its  resolution, which is 2.5x the FD91's.)  The cost equation on the FD91 is  outstanding, because although the purchase price is high, the advantage of  no film cost soon makes it the cheapest possible photo solution for anybody  who shoots a lot of pictures.", "Date": "July 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "All in all, the BEST camera out there for the home user", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2EYUGZM8PE2S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is TOPS for home use.  The pros might find a few things lacking, such as the limited flash intensity and inability to add an external flash.  The ONLY other draw back I have found it the length of  time it takes to save a pic.  It takes approximately 3-4 seconds for the  pic to save, so rapid fire shooting is out.  But, with the floppy drive,  and ultimately endless storage capacity (how many disks can you carry?)  makes this a tolerable drawback.  It is not in the megal pixel range, but  in the 1024x768 fine mode, I have found that the resolution is very good.  NOTHING beats the zoom on this thing.  14x zoom!

(Amazing in the computer world) Others have cameras with more pixels, more storage, etc., but no one has  matched the lens. a 14x (38mm-510mm) optical zoom is unmatched. Combine  that with the floppy storage (no easier method for transporting to multiple  computers) and the multiple viewfinders (LCD screen and eyepiece) and you  have an unbeatable combination.  The resolution is more than acceptable for  anything but professional use (and even for professional use online) and I  bet hardly anyone uses anything other than JPEG mode anyway. A real winner!

Those features make it into a very high quality camera.  I bought this camera thinking that it was an  advantage that it uses 3.5\" disks instead of memory cards but I now  think I would rather it use memory cards just because it would hold more  pictures and I wouldn't have to carry around stacks of disks.  That's not  too big of a problem though because the quality of the pictures are  fantastic.  I use this camera all the time and would recommend it to others  that don't mind that it uses 3.5\" disks.

Holyoak", "ReviewID": "RZU64U8QZLKEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, a confession...I am not \"Joe-digital camera.\"  I don't get involved in discussions about how many mega-pixels a camera has, etc., but I know that I am sold on the Sony Mavica line in general, and on this camera in particular...here's my story...When my department found enough funds to purchase a digital camera I campaigned for a SONY Mavica. I had used one briefly, with nothing but success.  What a camera, easy to use, and good results, too!  We went the rounds about pixels, and the rest...but in the end the point that tipped the scales was that this camera has an option that other makers simply didn't offer, the ability to use standard 3.5\" floppies.The 3.5\" floppy option is perfect for us.  The camera is used by multiple people (including students), who work at their own computers.  That means that we could avoid having to track down the patch cords for downloading, hassles associated with multiple station use of software, and etc.  Whew!The camera has a 14x zoom capability that makes it easier to use the entire frame.  You can take photos at different resolutions, depending on the use and the number of images you want to put on each disc.  In addition to still images, this camera lets you make MPEG files.  They're fun, and they can be useful.As for ease of use...I was taking pictures in less than 5 minutes after I picked up this camera for the first time -- and this is the first digital camera I ever used!  When you take photos you have the option of using a viewfinder or a small LCD screen to frame your photo.  As a long-time 35mm SLR camera fan I the eyepiece a comforting option.  After a while I suppose I could get used to the LCD screen...it's a reasonable size, and in color.The camera's menu system is easy to use, you can even delete unwanted photos immediately.Be prepared for a camera that's a bit bigger than most digital cameras out there.  This camera is comparable in size and weight to many changeable lens 35mm cameras systems.  On the plus side, the design is ergonomic.  It feels good in your hand.  The grips are well designed, there is someplace for your hands and fingers to go.  I like that.Our department bought this camera at full price.  At the currently discounted price I'm toying with the idea of getting one of these for myself...but I better talk to the wife about that (hint -- that's always a good plan).To sum up, this is a great camera.  It's convenient, easy to use, and a great deal to boot! What more could anyone ask?  And this is a lot of camera for the money!  If you take a lot of photos, the money you save in developing will eventually pay for the camera!P.S.  I wonder how long it will be before my 35mm SLR is a collector's item?  Probably not too long with cameras like this one around.Happy snapping!Alan Holyoak, Department of Biology, Manchester College", "Date": "January 20, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "bob donnelly", "ReviewID": "R1TC0L73XYBOCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best thing sence the toaster!

This camera, is definitely worth the money that i paid, therefore it is without a doubt a hot buy here for its current price.The camera is truely state of the art, one of my many favorite features of this camera would have to be the usage of a 3.5 floppy disk. thats right folks, you simply insert a 3.5 floppy disk into the side of the camera, and vwoala! you snap pictures, when that is used up, insert another one. if the disk isnt formatted, the camera will format it for you. you then insert the disk into you hard drive (Computer drive, that is) and view your pictures.The picture quality is wonderful, its clean and crisp. I actually used this at my brothers highshool graduation, took the pictures home, and printed them out. The pictures came out fantastic. not only did i snap pictures, and delete the ones that i didnt like right from my camera, i recorded approx 30 seconds worth of video footage, which can be used with real player.This camera is one of my favorite electronic goodies around my house, and i have a lot of electronic goodies. The zoom on this camera is quite good, but it pales in comparison to the 1.4X zoom lens that i bought for this camera, man, now that thing is sweet. can we say telescope?!This camera is definitely worth the mula. whether youre looking for a camera for recreational use (like me), or if youre going to use it as a professional photographer (like my dad's friend, who introduced it to us) this camera will satisfy your needs, and then some.It's a fun little gadget, its easy to use, and you'll love it.

It makes use of an HTML index of all photos or video recorded on a floppy diskette. The floppy disk as storage is one of the primary attractions in terms of getting digital images to the computer. It is also its greatest weakness. In the RAW image format (TIFF), the Mavica can store (1) image on a diskette. With a \"fine\" setting you will likely get storage of 20-22 JPEG compressed images on a single 1.4 MB diskette. Being a MAC and PC user I was very concerned about the PC format required for the floppy diskettes. But, I know most modern Power MAC's can format or read a diskette from a PC. The format of the photos (JPEG) is universal across most all platforms. The digital video output is limited to 60 seconds at the most modest resolution setting (approx 180 X 240 pixels.) Video output can be edited or viewed by Quicktime Pro for MAC or any MPEG-2-able video editor on the PC. The other setting for still photos will give the photographer a wide range of resolution choices for uses like e-mail or still photos with short accompanying sound tracks (also in MPEG-2.) As a professional photographer, I've been very happy with the photo-quality output from a variety of color printers (Apple and Epson). There are distinct limitations due to the .8 megapixel resolution, which really doesn't allow for much of an enlargement over 8\" X 10\". On top of that, your original image needs to be exposed correctly and should not require a lot of digital filtration or cleanup once it reaches the computer. The best original  yields the best results. On the whole, I've found the results to be a little below my desire for better output and higher resolution. This camera has maintained an excellent price resale level as a used camera, and the optical 14X zoom is one of the best around with top notch optical quality. The next model up with a Zeiss lens sells for several hundred dollars more and may be justified with Zeiss-quality optics and the option for Sony memory for storage in addition to the floppy disk. This camera does require a little setup to use, it is not a point and shoot camera. There's a white color balance option based on evaluating the hue of the incoming light through the white translucent lens cap- don't lose the lens cap! Overall this is one of the best digital cameras I've used in terms of color rendering. Perhaps one of its' strongest features is the camera's ability to achieve very life-like color and it does so without much muss and fuss. The Mavica FD-91 handles close-ups extremely well, even with the built-in flash. I found it lacking only in it's inability to trip an external flash unit with a hot shoe or synch plug. You have to rely on the built-in flash as the main light source and this becomes a real drain on the battery. By the way, purchase a couple of optional Lithium batteries; the NP-F550 is Sony's longest charged battery for this model to date. I also recommend getting a camera case for this model as a plastic, Kevlar reinforced body is no substitute for a bomb-proof metal body at half the weight. Without breaking the bank, originally this would have been considered as one of the nicer buy-ins of digital image creation technology. But, according to current standards (2004), it is considered expensive and lacking in the higher resolution that current cameras 1/5th of the price now incorporate. Currently, I could only recommend it for purchase as a used camera, provided you could get it for about a third of the orginal price when sold new.", "Date": "February 20, 2000"}, {"Title": "A Military Perspective", "Author": "Melissa Meinzer", "ReviewID": "R2C8Z8G5QCD8AU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera while overseas in Macedonia.

In the entire 10 years there have been NO camera issues whatsoever. it's been perfect and has been in use at least weekly the whole time. I have replaced the battery several times; count on it to last a couple of years with regular use. The only drawback for me is having to constanty swap floppy disks since in its max jpeg resolution, it only holds about 5-10 shots per disk, depending on image complexity. And of course, it's a pain to transfer files to a PC. You have a choice of using the LCD panel or the viewfinder, which is really handy in sunny locations.

First, it doesn't store pictures on memory cards like most cameras, it stores on floppies.  This means you probably already have the \"memory.\"  When I first purchased this camera, that was great because 16 MB memory cards were expensive and if you were taking a lot of pictures, it could add up real quick.  Now, 128 MB memory cards are cheap and will hold 100x the pictures a floppy will hold.  That said, the picture quality is great for this class, and the zoom will astound you.  A friend has this same camera and uses some passive flash units with it to create off-center flash lighting.  The built-in flash is only good for a narrow distance range of about 10 ft.  Much closer and it floods the subject, much further and it doesn't reach, but this is easily overcome, plus, you don't need a flash with this camera in many situations where a conventional camera would need one.

Garvey \"Shastalore\"", "ReviewID": "RMZTEG5W9HAZQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up this 33-ounce dinosaur-of-a-camera at a yard sale, for $ 5.00, simply because I was intrigued with its well thought-out design and many clever features.There are two major points I'd like to make, before delving into the details of this camera:If you're going to seriously use this camera, be sure to purchase a Sony (or an equal capacity clone) NP-F550 InfoLITHIUM battery, 7.2V, 18.5Wh = 2500mAh, Li-ion.Maximalpower SON NP-F550 Battery for SONY InfoLithium L NP-F330 NP-F550 NP-F570 CCD-SC55 CCD-TR516 CCD-TR716 CCD-TR818 CCD-TR910 CCD-TR917 2500mah fully decoded w/3yr warrantyThis will last all weekend, going through multiple 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskettes, and still show no signs of discharging.Only batteries with the internal \"InfoLITHIUM\" microchip will work in the MVC-FD91. Believe me, I've tried. I removed the vertical plastic rib inside the battery compartment and inserted a generic 7.2V Lithium-ion battery, but an error message appeared on the display and the camera promptly shut down.And the standard Sony NP-F330 (7.2V, 5.0Wh = 676mAh, Li-ion) InfoLITHIUM battery will only get you through one 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskette  -and that's provided you don't decide to erase any photos in the process.The next important point is that the Sony MSAC-FD2 Memory Stick Floppy Disk Adapter  -or any brand of floppy disk adapter, will not work with the MVC-FD91. You're confined to basic 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskettes on this camera. I know, the Sony MSAC-FD2 was a Memory Stick Floppy Disk Adapter that was designed to be compatible with many of the Sony Mavica series cameras with internal 3.5-inch diskette drives. But the MVC-FD91, unfortunately, was not one of them. The Sony Mavica series cameras, that did work with the floppy disk adapter, had a small switch inside to detect the adapter and align the head. So attempting to use any flash memory floppy disk adapter, in the Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD91 camera, will only generate a disk error message on the display. Anyway, even those Sony Mavica cameras that were designed to use a flash memory floppy disk adapter: Its two CR2016 internal batteries entered discharge mode everytime the floppy disk adapter was inside a 3.5-inch disk drive, in the Mavica series camera or in the computer. Not exactly an efficient design.For those who truly miss the days of the 35mm single lens reflex film camera, read on, as this one just might be the digital camera for certain limited applications. The shutter release triggers an unmistakable electronic sound that mimics the mechanical shutter release of vintage 35mm SLR film cameras. This camera was shrewdly designed to wean old school photographers from their 35mm SLR film cameras. With automatic/manual toggle on many features, this digital camera does give the skilled photographer considerable control of every shot.And those who wax nostalgic about their old 4x5 sheet-film view cameras will feel quite at home, using a heavy tripod, black cape, and frequent switching of the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskettes, although the lens is permanently at 90 degrees to the digital CCD image sensor, and the digital resolution is much less than 4x5 sheet film images. But I'm not really joking about the black cape, as it is still helpful for those shots in the field that require careful manual focusing. But I have since attached a \"eFilm DU2.5\"-M\" fold-out sunshade (see link posted below) to the 2.5\" TFT color LCD monitor, and while not as good as the black cape, it's more convenient, not as ridiculous, and greatly helps in direct sunlight. It also protects the 2.5\" LCD monitor from damage, when the camera is not in use.Delkin Devices DU2.5-M Universal Pop-Up Shade for 2.5-Inch LCD ScreensSporting a 2.5-inch TFT color LCD monitor that physically rotates 180 degrees, the camera functions quite well for flat-field copy shots, when mounted vertically, and pointed down at a copy board with side illumination. This camera also has a \"optical\" digital through-the-lens viewfinder, not unlike those of the single lens reflex 35mm film cameras of yore  -great for action shots in bright sunlight. The two viewing modes, both fully digital, are easily toggled back and forth as needed. There is also dioptic adjustment on the \"optical\" digital viewfinder for those who wear glasses.But, instead of using manual focus, I have found a way to be expedient in the field, by leaving the camera on \"Auto Focus\" mode, as well as \"Steady Shot\" image stabilization mode, and then on my laptop at home, opening up each photo in \"iPhoto Plus 4.0\"  -or any photo manipulation software, and electronically enhancing the sharpness by only one increment. \"IrfanView\" will also do this, and will even batch process the sharpness of all of the photos in one sweep, if needed. The photo resolution is not changed by this, but the image really \"pops out\" and appears clearer and sharper. I uploaded some of these \"sharpened\" photos, for you to judge, but you'll have to scroll down the web page to find them.As I usually shoot XGA 1024x768 jpeg photos, in fine mode. The 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette has the capacity for 6 photos per 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette, and is perfect for my requirements.VGA (640x480) jpeg photos, set on fine mode, provide a 13-photo limitation per 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette. Typical 640x480 fine-option jpegs can range from about 51KB to 147KB in size.Note: While capable of saving a bitmap photo, the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette only has the capacity for one such photo.I've applied a 2.75\" x 2.125\" label to each 1.44MB 3.5\" formatted diskette, for special notes  -a definite plus for organizing photo-shoots.For quality ambient-light photos, I find that a sturdy, retractable mono-pod is essential in any less-than-bright sunlight situations, as the 1/3\" CCD (0.8 megapixel) sensor seems to exhibit a true ISO rating of only about 50 (although Sony optimistically specs a ISO value of 100). So, especially for those long-telephoto shots, the use of a mono-pod is mandatory, for image sharpness.Featuring a 14x optical zoom (5.2mm to 72.8mm) lens with auto-focus option (equivalent to a 37 to 518mm zoom lens on the old 35mm film cameras), the camera has a f/1.8 to f/11 aperture range.Exposure range is 1/60 to 1/4000 of a second, for ambient light, and 1/60 to 1/1500 of a second, in flash mode.The OEM Sony NP-F330 (7.2V, 5.0Wh, Li-ion) InfoLithium battery has adequate power to handle only one 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette, before a mandatory recharge. Attempting to load and shoot a second diskette may produce corrupted image files that are not obvious until uploaded and viewed in your home desktop computer. And don't forget that erasing images in the field still drains the NP-F330 battery, sometimes shutting down the camera before the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette is completely filled with photos.But I have since purchased a generic NP-F550 (7.2V, 18.5Wh, Li-ion) battery, for all-day shoots, on multiple diskettes.And, as another reviewer noted: This old camera will NEVER be stolen. And I also feel that it's just too big to ever be misplaced or lost.And, at a market value of $ 5.00, I won't hesitate to put it in harm's way, for those demanding shots.I gave this camera a 3-star rating, simply because it's just too out-dated to seriously endorse. But if I had done this review back in 1999, I would have most certainly given it a 5-star rating.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for work", "Author": "kim a paulsen", "ReviewID": "R1PUC5VG23ZMRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This takes great pictures.
