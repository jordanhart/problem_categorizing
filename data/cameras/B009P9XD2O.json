Alone I would 5-star that part. You probably have seen the score of 80 that it got on dpreview.com, or if you haven't, you should. It is well worth it. The extras that you get with this entire kit are not so hot. Perhaps I will use the case for one of our smaller cameras, but this is like a classic bait and switch. The case looks big in the photos, but no sizes were given. Turns out it is too small to hold anything except (barely) the camera. So far the telephoto lens would not let the camera focus correctly. Maybe I need to read more. The tripod looks big, but fully extended and all legs together it is 36 inches tall. With them spread correctly it is 34 inches tall. This is about 2/3 of normal height. The flash provided is an Agfa, and it takes about 10 seconds to recharge. It is provided with a bar for use with a pocket camera.  The actual flash on the camera recharges quickly--say in about 2 seconds. There is a cord provided for linking your camera to your computer for downloads, and a high-speed card reader for the 16 GB SD card that is part of the kit. The filters provided are UV, Circular polarizer (removes unwanted reflections) and a Fluorescent (FL-D) filter. I haven't tried the macro lens adapters, but they are +1, +2, +4 and +10 close-up lenses. There is an HDMI cable for attaching to a TV. There is a starter kit with a tiny tripod, 5 q-tips, and a bottle of lens cleaner and a tiny lens cleaning cloth. There is the lens cover and cord to attach it to the camera. There is the hood for outdoor use to prevent sunspots in the lens. There is the battery and wall charger and a travel charger for use in a car. There is a lens cleaner brush that is like a pen, the brush pops up when extended. There are two CDs to instruct you and provide SilkyPix Developer Studio 3.1 SE. Oh, and the flash battery cover came with rust specks on its steel part that touches the batteries. Add it all together, and you have a lot of useful things and maybe you'll still want this, as there is a lot here, but you at least will go into it with your eyes wide open.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "cindy", "ReviewID": "RFN3WKXYPR8OK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera bundle at a real good price and i did alot of research on the type of camera i was looking for. I wanted one with a super zoom range and one that i could take pics of my children in sports. I found many cameras that did just zoom or one that was good for sports. I found this camera and read nothing but great reviews about so this is the one i bought. Now let me tell you it has the best zoom i have ever seen and it takes great fast moving pictures. I am still getting use to all its features but so far its been great. now with the bundle package its comes with alot of stuff. The first thing i want to say is the camera bag is really small and only fits the camera snugly. So you will have to get a bigger bag to take the camera and any accessories you want to bring. but if you are looking for a nice professional like camera but don't have thousands to spend on one then this camera is for you! so i definitely recommend.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009P9XD2O"}}
