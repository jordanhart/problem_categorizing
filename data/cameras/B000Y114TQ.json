They work great to convert a CCTV camera to IP signal for recording to a network server and for live viewing from the web browser. This seller HDVideoDepot has not sent a shipping confirmation and the product was ordered 10 days prior to today. I would love to have the product, but I may have to cancel this order and find another supplier that can get it to me tomorrow. I give 4 stars for the product and 0 stars to the company for no response. Please correct his issue as soon as possible.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "J. R. Schwartz", "ReviewID": "R1PAOC1RY4YUJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of those $500 wired security systems (made by First Alert) from Menards. It comes with for cameras, its own monitor for viewing and a built-in DVR for recording. But I wanted a way to view the video feed from elsewhere in the house. This item fits the bill! I just plugged in a coax from the output of the First Alert to this video server, then plugged an ethernet cable to a network hub.It did take a little configuring... you have to use a program on the CD to initially configure it, and this program works only on Windows. All I have are Macs. The program would not work using Parallels (which lets you run Windows on the Mac within Mac OS X). But I do have a Macbook with Windows installed in Boot Camp, which lets you boot up the lap in native Windows mode. The program ran fine that way. The important thing in using the program is to initially set the IP address for the video server. Once you do that, you can just configure the device with a web browser.Another nice thing is the built-in web server of this device does not use Java or Flash to serve the video, so the video is viewable on iPads.Also, I was concerned with the small size of this device that it would get hot (devices that process video tend to create a lot of heat). But it runs cool as a cucumber.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000Y114TQ"}}
