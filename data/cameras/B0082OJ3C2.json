{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Going....Going....", "Author": "Jeff  Czaja", "ReviewID": "R2IKNJ47HU0QIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...GONE!!!  Pentax, in my opinion, has smashed a home run with this camera.  I am a current K-x owner and that camera has served me very well for the past couple years.  I wanted to upgrade to a newer/better version of a Pentax.  This camera offers everything that the K-x had going for it, and expands what made that camera great into what I consider is an awesome camera.It's high ISO pictures are extremely good.  I've cranked it up to ISO 6400 and notice no noise in my Christmas light photos.  I'm sure that when you approach 12800, or expand up to 25600, you will notice significant noise.  But I would have no lack of confidence in shooting 6400 and below.The viewfinder is a pentaprism.  Which in it's price range is a rarity.  Most similar cameras offer pentamirrors.  What's the difference?  With the pentaprism you get 100% view coverage, what you see in the viewfinder is what will be taken.I have not found fault with the 18-135mm lens I bought with the kit.  I haven't and normally do not pixel peep.  It seems like a very solid lens.  I like that it covers a very nice range from wide angle to moderate telephoto.Weather resistance is AWESOME for this price range.  I've already taken it out in the rain, and have had my 3 year old son splash it while I was photographing him in his bubble bath.  I can't wait for some snow storms (as long as it doesn't drop below 14 degrees F) or next spring/summers thunderstorms when I try to get a perfect lightning shot.  You honestly don't understand the piece of mind this weather resistance offers until you have had it.  I used to scurry indoors with the K-x.I mainly, almost exclusively use the camera for photos, not video.  The K-30 shoots video in 1080p/30fps, so that is a selling point for some of you.  Although is doesn't have stereo mics.  Again, no biggie to me, I photograph things, not video record them.  I could purchase a $250 video camera that would blow almost all cameras out of the water if I wanted to take videos.The display is worlds better than the K-x, I can't do justice to the upgrade it is versus the K-x. 3\" and 921K.  A very solid display, sure no flipping and moving, but the camera is water resistant after all.  Doesn't bother me that it's fixed.  I do 99% of my photography through the viewfinder anyway.I can't really give a fair review of the live view composing, I have tried it, and with the new bigger, crisper display it seems to make it easier.  Focusing is much faster than the K-x, and it does have focus peaking when composing your shot/vid.  Again, I can not fairly review this feature.I bought this camera instead of the K-5, K-5II, and K-5IIs mainly because it's cheaper, but in all honesty I like that fact that if I am pressed for time I can choose a scene and let the camera do the computing, and if I want to set into full manual I can do that as well.  Pentax also offers Av, TAv, Tv, User modes, etc; in which the camera selects one (or more) of Exposure, Aperture, ISO, and you choose the rest.  Very nice feature.Honestly I can't think of anything to bash this camera on.  For the price, compared to similarly priced DSLR's; in true Pentax tradition, you get A LOT of bang for the buck.  Class leading APS-C images, weather resistant body, fantastic ISO images, etc.  I only wish that Pentax spent more money on marketing, and re-introducing themselves to the USA market/stores.  These cameras are extremely good, and I love the fact that nobody seems to know this.Please ask me questions and I will try to respond...if you've read this, and were hesitating on purchasing, DON'T...this camera ROCKS", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent DSLR...another winner from Pentax", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R122NB58L3EWR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DISCLAIMER: This review is from a still-shooter's perspective. I don't use video that often so look elsewhere if you want an in-depth review of the video functions on this camera.Updated 7/24/13The K-30 is an excellent DSLR for still shooting and offers a very robust feature set for the money. It has since been replaced by the K-50 in Pentax's lineup but the differences between the two are minute. So unless you want access to the new DAL WR lenses, you can save yourself some money by going with this model (I suggest getting the kit with the 18-135 WR).Image quality from this camera is excellent. It has the same look as files from the K-5 (except for slightly inferior dynamic range)..bright, punchy, and sharp. The camera produces exceptionally clean files right through ISO1600 and even through ISO6400 it does a good job balancing noise, noise reduction, and detail capture. The 18-135 WR is a good starter lens due to its focal length. It's sharp at the wide angle but gets sort of soft at the telephoto end (not an uncommon problem with zoom lenses). But despite middle of the road optical performance...you aren't going to find a kit with an 18-135 weather sealed lens for under $1,000 from the other guys...so it's still a worthwhile purchase.Speaking of RAW files... Pentax saves RAW files in the Adobe dng file format exclusively with this camera and does away with the .PEF format on their older cameras. This is a wonderful feature because this universal file format will open in most photo editing software (I use Apple's Aperture and I had no problem opening the files).The only real downsides to this camera image quality-wise that I can think of is that the camera has a tendency to underexpose a little and the colors are somewhat inaccurate (and a tad oversaturated) in its default setting. However, these are only minor demerits and are easily adjustable in the camera settings. And on the exposure issue, I would rather the camera underexpose and retain detail than overexpose which makes it harder to recover lost detail in some instances.In other areas of performance... the AF performance is a distinct improvement over the K-x and K-r and is about on par with the K-5. In most shooting situations, it performs quite well, but it can struggle in low-light situations sometimes. One good thing about the 18-135 WR lens is that it has a built-in focusing motor so that helps AF performance overall. Shot-to-shot times are good, and the camera's burst speed performs as advertised with a decent buffer.The K-30, like its predecessors, offers a pretty good set of still shooting features for the enthusiast crowd. Things like Chromatic Aberration adjust as well as the highlight correction option which helps preserve detail. You can also convert JPEGS back to RAW in this camera which is something very unique. It also has a RAW button on the front of the camera like the K-5 did. The viewfinder is great, 100% coverage with a high degree of magnification.The camera is comfortable hold and shoot with. It is not a light camera overall, but it feels very solid and well-made and of course its weather-sealed. I have yet to test its weather-sealing so I can't vouch for how good it is, but from the reviews I've seen, it works as advertised (just don't completely submerge it in water though). I especially like having dual dials which is something that isn't terribly common on a sub-$1,000 DSLR. Overall the menu system is similar to its predecessors although the main interface has been redesigned a little to make it look more modern. The LCD on back is generally nice but has issues in direct sunlight like a lot of them do. One thing the camera does have is pretty snappy AF performance in live-view, which sets it apart from most other DSLRs. It's not lightning-fast, but it is faster than any other DSLRs I have seen, and is only bested by Sony's DSLT models and most Micro 4/3rds cameras as well.The battery port is the same as the K-r. It comes with the same Lithium Ion battery pack which delivers okay battery life. However, like the K-r, AA batteries can be used with the same adaptor that was used with the K-r. So that's one bonus if you're thinking about upgrading from the K-r.As for the video... it's good from what I have seen and an improvement over its predecessors. But Pentax does not offer an external microphone jack... which is a puzzling omission at this price point. If you are equal parts stills and video enthusiast.... the Canon Rebel T5i/700D is a better choice in this class of camera.Despite being a year old, the K-30 remains good value for money. And since its successor offers no real benefits over this model (only slight improvements), you can save yourself some money and buy this model instead while it's still around. For still shooting, it's one of the best APS-C cameras on the market.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the advanced photographer.", "Author": "Lloyd W. Hayes \"Lloyd\"", "ReviewID": "R210YYCL49M7FR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 40 years worth of Pentax SLR and DSLR cameras. The K-5 and the K-30 can stand right along with their 35mm equivalent cameras. They are great cameras. I bought the K-30 a few months ago, and have used it for portraits. It has far more features then I need, since I really only need a camera with a manual setting.It is an advanced camera for advanced users. It can use any Pentax lens made for any previous Pentax SLR or DSLR model, including the older 35mm film cameras. All Pentax digital models have been water resistant. They simply tightened the seals for this camera.Many people here will list all of the benefits of this camera, and it has many really nice features.But it also has two down sides.1. Unlike the K-5, this camera does not have a PC plug for external flash units. I use a wireless transmitter which sits in the hotshoe. You can also use an adapter with a PC Plug. (The camera has a wireless system for using a wireless flash, but I have yet to get the camera's wireless system to operate correctly with studio flash units.)2. Like all auto-focus cameras, it does not always auto-focus correctly on very black skin.In the end, all that matters are the photographs. This camera makes great photographs. If you don't want to spend enormous sums of money on Nikon or Canon DSLR cameras and lenses, but you want the same great photographs, then this is the camera for you. Plus it will go where Canon or Nikon wishes they could go.  (I like Nikon and Canon cameras. Mainly, I like Nikon. But I don't like the amount of money that you wrap up in them. That is why I have always ended up with Pentax. Same quality. Nearly the same features. Less price.)OK, I read a review here where a person purchased this camera, but didn't like it because they couldn't figure it out. I understood the feeling. I am now 62, but when I was 14, my Aunt, who had been a magazine photographer, gave me a Leica 35mm camera. I took it home and tried to figure it out, but couldn't. I had been used to using drop-in cartridges in cameras with simple lenses. No one at home knew how to operate it either. I gave it back to her a couple of months later. In later years, I wished that I still had it.DSLR cameras are great for advanced amateur photographers and professional photographers. People who get into doing things with cameras that automatic features and setting just won't handle. Or they need to sometimes use a +1,000 mm telephoto lens, or a 15mm wide field lens, or some other uncommon situation. Or these cameras are for people who want to learn to do these things.If you are not in this group, and you don't wish to invest the time and effort necessary to learn the art of creating nice images, then a small point-n-shoot camera is probably a better choice for you.I hope that this helps. I really like this camera.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible Value, Pictures, Menu System", "Author": "Eric Cartman", "ReviewID": "R3GLRD7NEHLN6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sold my Nikon D40 and had some decisions. Was looking at the Nikon D5100, D7000, and the Canon T4i. Considered waiting to decide until Nikon introduces the inevitable D5200, but after weighing all the options, and considering the phenomenal value that is the K30 - I bought it. (white body w/standard 18-55 lens - sexy) I'm new to Pentax and glad to have made the change. Nothing against Nikon or Canon, but on top of taking excellent pictures, there is something unique about having the Pentax. I prefer the menu system over both Nikon and Canon - simpler for me to navigate. (Though deleting photos on Nikon remains simpler - hitting the 'delete' button does it all.)I'm waiting for Sigma to release their newish 18-250mm F3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM in a Pentax mount - then all will be perfect. They already have it for Nikon/Canon - gets great reviews. Not water-resistant (the Sigma lens), but that was never a decision making factor in the K30. (Though nice to have.) I wanted a great camera to fit a good all-in-one lens onto and be done. It lets me take great photos (and it does - even with the stock 18-55 lens) and ease into more complex picture taking as I feel fit.People dog the video, on this and other DSLRs. My response is - get a video camera. Video in the DSLRs has been something of a gimmick since introduced. DSLRs aren't great for video, camcorders aren't great for stills. I wanted great stills - the K30 fits that bill.Love the grip, ergonomics, the picture quality, build quality, and value compared to competition. Highly recommended if new to the DSLR world, or like me - upgrading from D40 or the like.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXTREMELY AWESOME CAMERA FOR A DSLR PROFESSIONAL OR BEGINNER!", "Author": "THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"", "ReviewID": "RBX8PUW1UEM4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST OFF I am not a PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER there are plenty of reviewers who can tell you the facts of this camera from a true photographers perspective.  I am just an average consumer guy who likes to take QUALITY STILL PICTURES of whatever strikes my odd AUTISTIC WEREWOLF fancy's!  My problem, I've found the standard point and shoot camera's lack the enhanced image quality I demand.  Point and shoot cameras are designed with built in compromises to compensate for its single lens.  Most point and shoot camera's are horrible in low light conditions.  Most point and shoot cameras create images with too much image noise in them for my liking.I think the Pentax K30 is the best Digital SLR Camera you can buy.  Right out of the box on automatic mode you will take pictures that will likely astonish you and make friends drool.  The standard low end kit lens does a perfectly acceptable job photographing most subjects.  The built in flash does a great job illuminating most close range subjects.  If you just used this camera on fully automatic mode you would have at your command a photographic instrument capable of producing picture quality far superior to any mere point and shoot mongrel out there.  If ever you decide to be adventurous the Pentax K30 Camera has ample button's knobs and other controls needed to manage iso, aperture and other vital photographic settings.  The full color display is large and clear.  There is a rare and great optical view finder, I think goes the distance in making this a truly awesome camera.  For those who love using video only to frame their shot that mode is made easily available with the change of a few settings.  This camera is killer awesome in most low light situations which is much better than most other camera's I have used.  The pictures have VERY LITTLE NOISE in the final images.  This camera takes pictures in RAW formats that are compatible with Adobe Photoshop, Photoshop Elements 10 and Adobe Lightroom 4.  The advantage of capturing images in RAW format is that you do not lose any video information.  You see exactly what the video sensor saw without loss caused by processing images into JPEG \\ JPG format images.  More video image information contained in the RAW image format gives you greater freedom to manipulate your raw images during post production.The Pentax K30 is a camera the average customer can grow into at their own pace.  The Pentax K30 camera makes it easy for a DSLR newbie like me to experiment with light, shutter and focus settings without fear of breaking something.  The Pentax K30 Camera has an optional adapter that allows it to take conventional AA Batteries which means fresh batteries are always close as the next market, pharmacy, mini mart or other full service store.  You will never lose the opportunity to take that terrific shot because your special camera specific batteries lack sufficient charge.  The Pentax K30 Camera uses any of the K TYPE LENSES which are numerous and made adequate for most any situation.The Pentax K30 Camera is on a whole well made.  I find the battery closure mechanism to be the cheapest most ill engineered part of The Pentax K30 Camera and its not bad just it should have been more strongly engineered.  I have a Pentax K5 Camera and the Battery closure mechanism is far more secure.  The Pentax K30 Camera is made out of plastic and while I like the feel and weight of a metal Pentax K5 camera more, The Qaulity Thick Plastic Pentax K30 Camera does not feel at all cheap.  One of the finer things about the Pentax K30 Camera is its size and how it feels in my hands.  I have small hands with unusually long fingers and the Pentax K30 Camera feels as if it was made exactly for my hands to hold.  The Pentax K30 Camera is so perfectly sized for me; it is almost as if the Pentax K30 Camera is part of or an extension of my body.  The camera is not heavy at all.  My brother is a really BIG DUDE, 6 feet 8 inches tall and about 320 pounds, he has HUGE hands about the size of baseball mitts, with huge fingers. While my big brother can use the Pentax K30 Camera it is less comfortable for him.  My MUCH larger \\ younger brother favors my Pentax K5 which by it self is still on the small side for his BIG HANDS but becomes better suited for his HUGE GRIP with addition of its optional extra AA battery compartment.  Despite its plastic \\ Polycarbonate body the Pentax K30 Camera feels surprisingly solid in build quality.  The Tripod Mounting Point is metal not cheap plastic.  The Pentax K30 Camera hot shoe is covered but easily accessible.  The Pentax K30 Camera has various doors and flaps that are on a whole easily accessible.  The rubberized flaps used to access the USB and hot shoe take time to access until you get the \"Hang of It!\"The Pentax K30 Camera's digital view screen color is rich and true.  The lettering on the menu screens can be sized to normal or LARGE for those like me with older eyes.  The Pentax K30 Camera has many do-dads and special features that let you do lots of in camera processing too many for the likes of me to list.  Another cool thing about the Pentax K30 Camera is the radical luminescent cobalt blue color that literally jumps out at you.  The blue color dances in your eyes and is so different from the standard plain jane black cameras.  The blue camera makes a bold statement even when it is sitting still not being used.  For those artists who demand their equipment stand out from the photographic equipment pack this camera is sooooo YOU!  I am not prone to writing great reviews for any product at a drop of the hat BUT this Pentax K30 Camera is no ordinary photographers best friend.  Some time effort and thought went into designing this Pentax K30 Camera and in almost every aspect of its execution the lavish attention to detail certainly shows.  This Pentax K30 Camera is the perfect crossover camera for those tired of the point and shoot dull-drums that are not ready for the high-tech buttons of a full out professional grade DSLR.  The Pentax K30 Camera puts and keeps the fun in entry level DSLR photography.  The Pentax K30 Camera is the perfect storm of near perfect out of the box ease of use and mind blowing options for the experienced photographer.  Finally this Pentax K30 Camera is a workhorse camera that is sealed against weather if used sensibly.  This Pentax K30 Camera is not so delicate it will break at the slightest environmental challenge.  Yes there are better cameras in the world but, the Pentax K30 Camera is a near perfect fusion of form and function that is solidly built.  The K30 lacks some of the versatility of the K5 but the K5 lacks many of the consumer driven ease of use and image manipulation features of the K30.  The Pentax K30 Camera appears to be aimed squarely at consumers looking to trade up to entry level DSLR's from Point and Shoot Camera's and if I am right the Pentax K30 Camera hit almost center of its intended audience bullseye!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Weather sealing really works!  And focus peaking is great for old lenses...", "Author": "vagrant10 \"mh\"", "ReviewID": "R1NEH5ZO1D3K8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this camera and lens combo is a great deal!  The DA 18-135 picture quality is really good - it's quite sharp, gives great colors, and has a handy range where I can shoot pretty wide to a decent telephoto.  Great for a good all around lens.  It's also light and not very big.  But the amazing thing is the weather sealing in this price range.  I've taken it into some driving rain conditions and it handled it with no issues.  I've had Pentax weather sealed cameras before though starting with my 5 year old K10d, so I knew Pentax knows how to weather seal their cameras before I bought this K30.  But I had to test it and the weather in the Pacific Northwest this time of year makes it easy to test if the weather seals are working or not, and the K30 passed.I have some older lenses that I sometimes have difficulty focusing accurately on my older DSLR's so that was one of the main reasons I bought the K30.  I already knew the reviews on the K30 were all really good and the 16MP Sony CMOS sensor was an awesome performer in cameras like the Nikon D7000 and the Pentax K5 (which I own).  But I have some old lenses with apertures as wide as 1.2 and when shot wide open the really narrow depth of field makes focusing on what I want it to a real challenge.  With the K30 though, there's a feature called focus peaking which when live view is on, the area that is in focus is highlighted on the back lcd screen.  It's really cool... as you turn the focus ring, the highlighted part of the screen will move telling you what is in focus!  Seriously easy and very effective.I've been spoiled by some really good cameras like the Pentax k5, so I was a bit hesitant to buy the k30 since it's priced as a mid level camera and not like their semi pro models that I've gotten used to.  But I am really pleasantly surprised at the quality of the K30.  It's fast, it has 2 control wheels to make operations quick and intuitive, the grip is great, it feels sturdy and well built, the pentaprism viewfinder covers 100% .... and it's weather sealed and has focus peaking.  Just an awesome deal!Now some of the negatives... there is not a mic input, so if you're doing video, you will probably want a separate audio recorder.  I've found that sound quality is usually better anyway if you get the audio recorder as close to your subjects anyway so this is what I plan to do in any future video projects.  Another thing I'm not too thrilled about is that there is not a grip available for the k30.  Also, the battery is a bit small - I'd get an extra battery or at least the AA battery adapter just to have as a backup (which I'd recommend anyway).  I've bought the Wasabi branded generic batteries for one of my other cameras and they worked fine, so I'll probably be picking one of these up soon.  Another thing that I find a little annoying is that the bracketing option only allows for 3 shots instead of 5 like on the K5.  This is just dumb; there is no reason to do this since this is just a software issue.  Personally, I think this is just an instance where Pentax wanted the K5 II to have some features that the K30 did not have to help justify it's extra cost.  I hate it when companies do that... (I understand the marketing side, but it's still annoying).But really these negatives are pretty minor on a camera that is a over achiever on every other level.  Putting pro level features like weather sealing, pentaprism 100% viewfinders, dual wheels, electronic level control, micro AF adjustments for up to 10 lenses, TAV shooting mode (where you set the aperture and shutter speed and the ISO floats to get the right exposure), and button customization, all make this camera an awesome value.

I also read reviews of K-5 and K-30 to decide which would be my upgrade for my K-x.I chose K-30 because I have found a better price for it and it was offered with 18-135mm WR (which cost a lot more by itself) I enjoy this mid-range dslr with performance and build quality of Pro-dslr.K-5 was reviewed and named the best APS-C sensor dslr for Image quality, Dynamic range, and ISO performance.  Since K-30 shares same sensor but just with slightly different filter its images are almost identical.  Therefore, you get one of the best APS-C dslr on the market for less than half of the price of K-5 when it was introduced.Overall it is a great step up from K-x with too many improvements to list. (live view focus is way faster than K-x, and should be faster than K-5 and it has focus peaking to help with using awesome Pentax manual lenses)16mp is more than enough to make huge prints if needed, My K-x was 12mp and that was enough already. Some competition is increasing MP to 24 and higher, but I beleive it will not make pictures much better on APS-C sensor; It will fit full frame sensor much better because of less pixels per sensor size.I highly recommend K-30 to anyone that is looking to upgrade or to a new user that wants to get best dslr on the market, very good value for your money and with WR body.(see some of my images in product info for comparison of K-x and K-30 high ISO)", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbelievably clean images up to 12,800 ISO", "Author": "the blind hog", "ReviewID": "R25F1JV1LM989V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received mine a little more than an hour ago and have not done extensive tests yet because I am waiting for the battery to charge.

Anyways after just coming from a trip to the beach with it I can put a review as I finally tested it's WR. Got sand all over it and washed it off with water. Off course that now that I'm home I'm doing a proper cleanup (using a blower to get some of those small grains of sand out), but I'm now sure the WR is not just marketing. The camera (and the 18-135 WR lens) kept going just fine and I got great pictures that I wouldn't got with my previous DSLR. For me that's what's great about it, getting the camera out there and taking pictures no matter what condition you're in.On the camera side, dual sliders is great to quickly set aperture and shutter speed, and the viewfinder is also very good, bright and clear with 100% coverage. The sensor is also very good, producing images with great colors and dynamic range. It also handles high ISO very well. Focus peaking is also great on those older Manual Focus lens. I have a f1.2 lens that got a lot more use because of this feature. The menus are also direct and easy to use. The AF worked very well and very fast. And I say that after did some extreme usage inside a high speed vehicle! AF was great, framing the images was the hard part :)I haven't use the video very much (more of a still shooter myself) but it worked very well when I did. I also rarely shoot on auto mode (only when giving the camera for someone else to shoot) so I can't comment much on it. On a powerful camera like this I feel it's really worth taking a bit of your time to learn the basics of photography (like aperture, shutter speed and ISO) and really get the most of this camera. While a bit frustrating at first, in a very short while you'll start getting those pictures you just can't with auto modes (regardless of the camera). It's very rewarding!In my opinion this camera for it's price range is the best option. It really offers great features (WR, Shake Reduction, great sensor, pentaprism finder with a 100% field of view, great AF, dust removal, etc) at a great price. The Pentax System is also very good, it offers great lenses at a good price, and you also have the compatibility with older lens with means you can find great older lens at a bargain price.

The screen not tilting is one less thing to break.  The thing I have been most impressed with so far is the autofocus.  It is fast.  The exposures have been good and of course you can turn it all off if you want to.  I used Pentax in 35mm and have some good lens.  They all work just fine on this body.  The one thing that I just don't understand is why they call this an entry level camera.  I just can't can't think of anything else that I would need or want.  It's a huge step up from the Pentax K1000 that I started off with back in 1977. The 18-135 lens seems to be a great lens too.  It fast for a zoom lens and is a good lens if you only want one lens.  The one thing that you do need to remember is that the lens have to be weather resistant (WR) to keep the WR rating on the camera but any lens made for Pentax will work just fine.  I have Tamaron, Sigma and Pentax lens left over for my 35mm days and now I can put them back to use. Then there's Amazon.com.  I ordered it Sunday and it was on my porch Tuesday just in time for my birthday.  I do like to buy myself a nice present every now and then.

Many new camera enthusiasts are spurred to acquire their first DSLR camera upon certain upcoming life events such as a wedding, starting a family, or a upcoming overseas vacation. As a result, the market is flooded with cheap DSLR cameras vying for the attention and dollars of unsuspecting consumers. As anyone with a remote background in photography will explain, these cameras have little to do with megapixels and more to do with aperture, seamless functioning and lens capabilities. In most cases the image quality you receive ultimately has more to do with the focus capability and lens quality than the actual camera body. If you can understand these basic principles, you will understand why then Pentax K30 stands above several of its peers in the entry level DSLR market.Canon and Nikon are by and large the \"top dogs\" in this industry. Pentax has always been a step-sibling of sorts with Sony, Samsun, Sigma, etc. chasing behind. While Canon and Nikon make fantastic cameras, I believe they have begun to conform to using the entry level market to make markedly increased margin. For example, the Nikon D3200 boasts 24 megapixels. Compared to the K30s 16mp, it would seem like the Nikon is providing significantly better value. But as mentioned above, the megapixel rating has little to do with the overall camera ability.So what sets the Pentax K30 apart? In summary, it has many of the features that come standard on much more expensive professional DSLR cameras. Nikon and Canon tend to cut corners are their entry level models. This doesn't mean that they are bad cameras or won't take good photos. For 90% of people purchasing their first DSLR for basic picture taking (family photos, kids sports, vacation photos, etc.), you really won't notice many differences. But to people who know and understand cameras there are some significant differences. For example, the K30 employs a pentaprism viewfinder compared to a pentamirror in most cheap DSLRs (like Nikon and Canon). Professional photographers generally desire a pentaprism viewfinder as it lets in more light and provides a better true view of the picture. And as you might guess, pentaprisms are harder to build and thus more expensive. The K30 also comes standard with image stabilization and is weather sealed. These are two important factors. Image stabilization can assist a beginner photographer in capturing a better photo, and typically comes standard on much more expensive cameras. Weather sealing isn't normally that important (unless you're a sport photographer) because most professionals will pack up or move indoors once the rain starts falling and the light goes. However, for a beginner I think weather sealing is much more important. Professionals take special care of their equipment, whereas we know that most beginners won't think twice about cleaning their lenses. I think this provides an extra layer of protection to any new DSLR owner simply not used to the normal care a camera should have.However, two things that I wish the K30 did come equipped with that some of their competitors have are embedded wifi capability and an input for external mic.Bottom line, if you're looking at several entry level DSLRs on the market right now, I believe the K30 provides the most bang for the buck. You really can't make a bad choice between Pentax, Nikon, or Canon if you're only looking for a camera to capture some good photos, but if you're looking to learn and/or start a career as a photographer, the K30 stands above its competition.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "only nit picking", "Author": "walking", "ReviewID": "R2LUFEEWVBZLHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my K-1000 and wanted to get back into SLRs. Everything was in the package as I expected. My only nit picking is that the lens cover of the 18-135 lens can snag on just about anything, such as clothing, camera bag, thin air etc and fall off. I will either get a tether or another lens cover. If I put the light shield on, then the canmera will not fit into a camera bag, so that option is out, but it would solve the problem, if you do not mind the light shield. Also, the Li-Ion battery that shipped was totally dead. It would not charge in any charger I got that was designed to charge this specific battery. I got a new battery for this camera, and as stated, it does not last long as it is small for this camera. I think the AA batteries last longer. But I also got the AA battery holder so got to use the camera right away. Amazon was perfectly willing to have the entire package sent back and replaced with a new working battery, but could not, understandably, replace just the battery.  In my case they offered a rebate.

Before this upgrade from a Pentax Kr I researched all the major brands Nikon, Canon, Sony and Olympus however when I matched them up against each other the K30 was by far the most camera for the money.I'm into still photography so the one area that Pentax lags behind (video) wasn't much of a concern for me. I seriously considered dumping Pentax and going with another brand but at this level of camera the drawbacks to the other brands were just to many. Those camera were nothing more than point and shoots on steroids. They had none to little room for the growing photographer unless of course you bought a higher level of camera.This camera offers so many features that are usually found on camera's hundreds of $ more expensive.* Weather and dust sealing* Electronic level* 100% view through the viewfinder* Lens Auto Focus Fine Adjustment for up to 20 different lenses* Focus Peaking* Programmable Front and Rear Wheels* It not only has aperture and shutter priority (Tv, Av) it also has TAv(shutter-aperture priority ,Automatic Exposure)* Two USER Modes to save your favorite settings....and much more....The best though is the cameras exceptional IQ and handling of noise. I am no longer concerned with shooting at 3200 ISO and even up to 6400. ISO 3200 shots need little to no work while 6400 may need some depending on its use.Many fan-boys of other brands will point out the lack of lenses for Pentax. I have never found this to be the case there is a lens for everything I do. I've got 5 lenses some primes including the 100 mm Micro lens, and the Pentax 18-250mm, I've not wanted for anything.While this camera may be classified as entry level by some it has many features of a prosumer camera at hundreds of $ less. It's an easy enough camera for a beginner and has enough room for even the intermediate photographer to grow.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone considering a DSLR whether a beginner or intermediate user this camera will satisfy.Amazon did their usual wonderful job in getting this camera to me on time and also a shout out for Emmy Photography for offering the great Price. Thanks to both.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I wanted in a camera", "Author": "Marktwain10 \"Marktwain10\"", "ReviewID": "R2G3XUMXJIJYJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera fits my needs perfectly, and does everything better than the camera I had before it. And it is amazing at high iso values. I recently switched from a Sony a55 and though that camera had the same sensor, this Pentax version has been tweaked better. It's hard to describe, but he patterns of grain are just much more pleasing. I am debating if I will even need to buy a flash when my 50mm 1.8 lens gets here, since this lens will give me 2 extra stops of light. With some noise reduction in photoshop I wouldn't even rule out using iso 6400 on this camera. I have even successfully post processed an image shot at iso 12,800 that was nearly shot in the dark with the kit lens and it's not too bad. I will try to include it in the product images so you can see how the noise/ grain appears and that it can still be usable. I personally wouldn't ever go higher than this iso though. Note that I do shoot in Raw format, which is labeled as DNG format on this camera. DNG is a format written by Adobe (who makes Photoshop) but the good news is DNG never becomes outdated like other camera manufacturers RAW formats do, so I can use raw files from the K30 in Photoshop CS5 and don't need to upgrade to CS6 which would become VERY expensive.I really like how so many things can be customized within the menus of the K30, and buttons can also be customized. The image quality this camera delivers is good enough that I don't think I will be upgrading for a long time. I feel the autofocus has been sufficiently accurate and quick during the couple hundred of photos I have taken with it. It has been much more accurate than my entry level Sony a330 and even my Sony a55 was less impressive than the K30, which is strange because the a55 was advertised as having one of the best focus systems when it came out. The K30's focus peaking is handy for manual focus, but it would be nice if other color choices were an option. Since you can only focus peak with white highlights, this makes the focus region difficult to determine when in bright light. I feel Pentax should release a firmware update to allow users to switch the color to red or yellow like Sony DSLR's allow. Most of the time, I use the large and bright 100% coverage pentaprism viewfinder for manual focus, and it is so much better than the small pentamirrors and electronic viewfinders of the other DSLR cameras I have used. I personally always felt too disconnected from my subjects when using my Sony a55, because the small lcd viewfinder was as if I was looking at them through a small TV screen.Something else to consider is that the K30 has a small green button placed near the shutter button, which can easily be pushed to automatically meter and set the shutter speed that will correspond to your aperture and iso when shooting in manual mode. This is so much faster than scrolling one of the wheels to set the shutter speed to match the light meter. This reason alone will make it hard for me to leave Pentax! This green button is also what allows you to take a meter reading of the old manual focus Pentax lenses. The fact that the K30 has 2 control wheels (front and rear) was another consideration to my purchase. The K30 video is good enough for anything I will ever need. The K30 feels great in my hands, the grip is nice, and the camera isn't too big or heavy.Some small cons:  The SD card is a little difficult to get out of the camera, and the battery door seems a little flimsy, but this is me just being picky. My past Sony a55 had a sensor that turned off the rear screen when you put your face up to the viewfinder. The K30 doesn't have this, and won't turn it off until you half press the shutter to focus. This annoyed me at first, but I just keep the screen turned off which really prolongs the battery life. I just use the detailed info screen in the viewfinder to see my settings, and only use the rear screen to review photos and go through the menu settings. One last small gripe is that the K30 battery indicator shows battery life in 1/4 increments, whereas my Sony a55 could tell me the battery life down to the percent. None of these are deal breakers in any way, and these are the only small advantages I ever felt the Sony gave me.The weather sealing is a neat feature. I don't have any water resistant lenses but the fact that wet or sweaty hands can't get water inside and damage the buttons is reassuring. The weather seals will also keep dust and grime from getting under the buttons; another plus. And I forgot to mention, this camera looks like no other DSLR ever made, and is definitely unique. It's kind of fun to be different than everyone else and still have a camera that's a great performer.As with all DSLR cameras it is good to consider having spare batteries. With about a 500 shot battery life, this camera definitely needs a spare battery. I bought a $14 off-brand one that is working well. I like the fact the K30 can take Lithium AA batteries with the D-BH109 battery adapter and supposedly get over 1000+ photos. Rechargeable AA Ni-Cad batteries (like eneloops) are another option too. The Pentax branded battery adapter is rather pricey, but there are aftermarket ones for much less that I bought for $7. I have so many power options that I will never run out of juice during a shoot, and can use my AA eneloops for my flashes or K30 with adapter. I like to use fast primes, so \"in body image stabilization\" is a must for me. Since Nikon and Canon put image stabilization in only some of their lenses and not in the camera body, I prefer my Pentax which will stabilize any lens. It is also neat to know older Pentax K mount lenses from the 70's will work with this camera, and even Pentax screwmount lenses will work with an adapter. I was looking at buying a Nikon D7000 but I am glad I bought this camera since it gives you about just as much for much less money. I occasionally shoot engagement photos and family portraits, and would consider myself a skilled photographer. I hope this camera lasts me many years.Update: I have since bought and tested the DA 50mm 1.8 lens. I would like to add that sometimes the K30 autofocus will occasionally be inaccurate when using a narrow depth of field such as at f1.8, so take multiple shots and refocus between shots to make sure you nail it. Also the large viewfinder or focus peaking can help you confirm if the subject is in focus or not. But, the K30 is no less accurate than my Sony a330 and a55 were when using a Sony 50mm 1.8 lens.I also would like to add that my pop up flash stopped working after it had only been fired about 100-200 times. I was using it to trigger off camera flashes, but I found out that other Pentax users have had problems with pop up flashes dying early. It was replaced under a warranty, so with my new K30 I will save the pop up flash for emergencies only. I bought a set of low cost radio triggers to trigger off camera flashes instead. If you plan on using a pop up flash a lot, I would highly recommend using a bounce flash which gives much more natural lighting anyways. I use a few manual flashes that did not cost too much at all (one was a late 80's Pentax flash for $12, another was a new Yongnuo 460ii for $43). I still enjoy this camera a lot, so despite the minor flash issue I will keep my review at 5 stars.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "My best camera, ever!", "Author": "Alan Bruce Mccornack", "ReviewID": "R26D9XEO2KQSAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A longtime Pentax fan, the K-30 does not disappoint.

But I have to say that the (JPEG only) High Dynamic Range photos are INCREDIBLE, especially in low (or ordinary room) light.  Get the 18-135mm waterproof lens; until you find a macro subject, that lens will not need to come off the camera, rain or shine!

It shares the same sensor but a faster, more efficient processor. The button layout isn't quite as nice (especially the LV on the LEFT side of the body) but the 4-way directional toggle buttons are actually an improvement since on the K5 they were easily accidentally triggered while the K30 avoids the problem with a welcome properly elevated ridge adjacent to them. I found this arrangement less frustrating and more amenable to my large fingers.The shutter is very noticeably louder than the K5's. It also has a max speed of 1/6000th second compared to the K5's 1/8000th second. I suspect the life expectancy of the shutter is similarly compromised. There's no HDMI out. But most annoying of all is Pentax's decision (unlike the K01) to force purchasers to buy a lithium battery incompatible with the previous K5, K01, and K7. What were they thinking? There's no provision for a battery grip either. Yeah, you can buy an accessory to allow the insertion of AA batteries, but those don't exist in rechargeable lithium. Lithium is advantageous due to its light weight and power capacity. The lithium battery supplied is roughly the size of the ones that come with those little P&S; cameras like the Lumix ZS5 or ZS9 series. Thus, the K30 loses a great deal of what it could have kept with respect to staying power on long shoots despite having more than ample room.The door to the battery compartment doesn't feel as solid as the one on the K5 or the K01. Other ports are covered by rubber partitions that may avoid some moisture but feel annoying to close properly. The mode dial does not have a lock button in its center like the K5. It feels much too easy to inadvertently disturb during shooting. I didn't find a rear IR receiver for remote, either, like the K5 has. Possibly I just overlooked it if there.I had to send my K5 in for repair due to it easily overheating when LV is left on or during video recording. I waited until this K30 arrived to do so. That the K5, K01, and K30 all share the same extensive line of lenses as well as the same excellent sensor was a huge inducement for me to buy these. I'd advise buying the K5 while the fire sale prices last. You won't regret it. The K30 is simply fantastic as a backup camera which I'm hoping won't have the overheating problems I experienced with the K5. The K01 is also a reasonable backup (especially for video) but lacks a VF. That it (along with the K30) *DO* include focus peaking doesn't quite make up for the missing VF. The VF image on the K30 seems a bit muted compared to the K5. This may be due to the smaller prism. The lesser VF and niggardly battery on the K30 don't bode well for what may be in store: Pentax gaming its consumer base.Some may find the neck strap that comes with the K30 too short, but there's plenty of inexpensive alternatives.I haven't had a chance to put this thing through its paces in the field. I'll include an update when I do.At this stage (no field testing yet), I'd recommend this body as your SECOND one after the K5/K5-II, unless you're a serious wildlife photographer. The K30 is simply too noisy for that. In fact, it may be too noisy for some serious events like concerts, courtroom hearings, and religious/wedding services. The K30 is a good argument for a mirrorless camera, like the K01. On the other hand, it has just the panache for those news gathering scrums while it announces its presence with every shot. It might go unnoticed on a gun range, though. Other than that, it's totally inadequate for surreptitious photography/news gathering. Ultimately, due to Pentax withholding the goodies to keep this from cannibalizing its other models, it will come down to around 4 C-notes before too long. I parted with just over half again for mine. Still, it's all relative. This line is the best currently being developed on the APS-C style market. I did look at the Pentax Q model camera while at Robi's in Lakewood, WA. The Q looked & felt cheap. If I were given one, I'd immediately put it on Craig's list. Compared to the Lumix ZS* series, it seemed like a Cracker  Jacks box prize. The Q will end up as a forgotten footnote in the Pentax lineup.

So far I've taken a couple dozen photos in various light settings indoors and out.I am amazed at the quality of the photos even during \"shaky hand\" which there were a few.As I continue to get more involved with my K-30, I'll share more involved information about this great camera.Thanks again!VERY SATISFIED owner!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just plain awesome.", "Author": "Pericombobulation53", "ReviewID": "R26KZAV51OBEF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To summarize my review, I believe you simply will not find a better camera at this price (or even a few hundred dollars higher) from any other brand.  In my opinion, no other camera maker can touch Pentax's value proposition right now.  Am I a brand loyalist?  Not usually, but in this case yes I am because I've had other Pentax cameras before and they have all been wonderful photographic tools.  There are 4 reasons why I'm sticking with Pentax:1)  Build quality.  Sorry Canon and Nikon, but your sub-1000 dollar cameras feel like toys to me.  I don't mean to suggest that other companies build junk... I have friends who own Canon, Nikon, and Sony DSLRs and like them, and I have seen many good pictures come from these brands.  But in terms of fit and finish, and materials, Pentax is the class leader.  Just like my K-r and K-01, the K-30 feels very solid and well-built.  It has its share of plastic too, but somehow it just feels more durable.  I could never love a camera that cost me hundreds of dollars and feels like a toy.2)  Weather sealing.  I don't often shoot in the rain, but I might occasionally.  More to the point, weather sealing helps for more mundane scenarios.  My kid spilled milk on my camera.  My water bottle leaked.  I accidentally put my bag down in a puddle.  These kinds of situations are common enough (and DSLRs are expensive enough) that it's worth buying a camera that can protect itself.3)  Pentax generally offers more features at a lower price than other brands.  AF fine adjustment.  A pentaprism viewfinder.  Dual scroll wheels.  AA battery capability (if you buy the optional adapter).  Focus peaking.  Electronic level.  Interval shooting.  Catch in focus.  Expanded bracketing (some of the other entry level cameras don't even offer bracketing... totally ludicrous, especially in this day and age when bracketing is more useful than ever for HDR post processing).  What other camera offers all this in a sub-$500 body?  None that I'm aware of.4) Shake reduction on the body.  Nikon and Canon do shake reduction (vibration reduction) on the lens, not the body.  This means that their lenses are more expensive and complicated (and larger!).  It also means that on a Pentax, you can use any of the hundreds of different lenses that were made from the past several decades and they will all work ... with shake reduction!  I have some lenses which are almost as old as I am... they were made during the golden age of Japanese lens manufacturers in the 70s and 80s.  Incredible pieces of glass and generally very cheap too.  Pentax has not changed the K mount except to add auto focus and auto aperture.  So you'll have to set focus and aperture manually, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a problem at all.  There's a whole world of very high quality and affordable lenses for sale used that will all work just great with the K-30.  For instance, one of my favorite lenses is an SMC Pentax M 50mm f/1.7 that I picked up used for twenty bucks.  The shipping cost almost as much as the lens.  It produces stunning images and works wonderfully with the K-30.  Just read Pentax's online FAQ about how to set up the camera for older lenses and use stop down metering.The K-30 is very similar to the K-r which I recently traded in.  Yet the K-30 is more evolved.  The main reason I wanted to trade was for the newer 16 MP sensor, which offers better low light performance (less digital noise).  Pentax has tweaked numerous other things too, while still retaining the same basic look and feel of the K-r.  This is a very high performance camera and I for one could scarcely ask for more, as it suits my needs perfectly.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!

I am upgrading from a Panasonic point and click, and the quality of the images are just truly amazing from this camera!

The 55-300mm lens is truly amazing quality w/ this camera, and the kit lens performs well.  The scene selection offers great options for easy transition from point and shoot.  How I choose this camera was by reviewing the images comparison between similar cameras w/in the price range on the following site: imaging resource web site comparison tool.  For me, there was a distinct difference w/ image quality, that is definitely noticable.

What do you expect from a beginner to the dslr world. And I really hate these guys that ramble on about ISO and f this and f that, don't you? Like ' we ' in the common world know what in the world you're talking about. I do *NOW... but, not then and I found it to be quite irritating so, why don't you come off your rant and put it in language the rest of us can understand. And some do, don't get me wrong and we're all grateful. Anyway, I wrote I'd come back and edit my review so, here I am...Honestly, in my opinion, I think it's a great camera. I don't know exactly how it would stack up against others but, it is a great camera. I've heard it mentioned that you can't beat Japanese build quality. Which was one selling point for me. I didn't want something falling apart on me the first month of use. And it hasn't, still going strong. I haven't had one problem with it. Uh, well, something I did which was stupid... I got dust all over the sensor :| ... so, I bought some eclipse and some swabs and went to town, guess what, it worked, one beautiful, clean sensor now. No spots *at all.Ok, moving right along... I've taken something like 7000 photos so far and I don't honestly have any complaints. Like I was saying, I have nothing to compare them to. Ah, and all the ISO business and f this or that are all fun to play around with, by the way. I'm not completely up on it all yet, but I'm getting there. I just started playing around with *Raw mode. I don't get it yet, the picture I took in Raw/fx looks the same as the jpeg, of the same shot. Don't know, you got me.And I won't go into lenses here... quite honestly, I bought 4 great lenses.  I'd read everyone's reviews closely on lens's, because there may be 400 good reviews, but one that you need to read that is a 1 star review. That's my opinion... I bought a 50mm, 18-85, 35mm and 55-300 and all work great... $800 for the lens's and $450 for the camera... not bad for a beginner kit.Ok, bottom line, why did I settle for this camera... well, once upon a time this was a $8 or $900 camera so, it's got to be worth something! I've heard it compared to high end cameras in picture quality... And honestly from the pictures I've taken I'd tend to agree. And like I mentioned, build quality... I don't want something breaking down on me anytime soon. if I can get great photos out of this camera and have a long life camera, then I think it's worth the $450 I dished out. And I'd read a whole lot of reviews before purchasing the k-30... I'm not going to mention any manufacturer's here, but some really seem to stink. I started out looking for an Olympus and for one reason or another decided against the brand. One thing or another led me to and back to the k-30. Not just the price, I would have held out if I honestly though I was buying a piece of junk.Ok, the downside to this camera is that it's not the newer 24mp cameras... if you can, go ahead and find a good 24mp camera. I tend to think I wished i'd held out for the Pentax k-3 but, I didn't. The $1000 price tag was just out of my reach at the time I bought the k-30.And it's probably a little slower than your high end cameras... not that it's sloowww but, it's still probably slower. You have to learn to use this camera to get the shots you're looking for. And if you do I think you'd be well pleased at $450. But, like I mentioned, if you can go ahead and get the k-3 or maybe just a different 24mp camera.Not that it seriously means anything to me at the moment but, I've taken like I said 7000 pictures and whether it be low light, inside, outside, in the shade, wherever... given you know your camera and how to set it for each given situation, I think you'd get the shot you're looking for.D o n ' t  t r u s t  *Auto Mode* It's not always the shot you're looking for ... even though they do have a basic scene mode where you can select, low light, sun behind object, portrait, moving object, etc.. These work pretty well or ok... but, you still have to learn to use the ole camera and get it out of AM into M mode.And it has a Dust Removal mode, mmm, not sure about this function. I'd just go ahead and buy some cleaning equipment. Quite a few settings but, not really that difficult to learn. You just have to keep at it and memorize where everthing is and what they all do by, practice and reading the ole manual.Ok, did I do well enough job putting things in down to earth terms here? What do you want me to say? That it's like really really fast and it takes great shots every time... not happenin'. You have to find the right settings, the right lighting, the right flash, etc. (lens).All in all I think it is a great first dslr even though, like I mentioned, I wish I'd held out for the k-3 at 24mp...", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE THOSE DIGITAL FILTERS", "Author": "Robert D.

What I like about them the most is their post image processing abilities that other camera manufacturers skimp over.  The new K30 is probably the best example of that so far.I'm an artsy kind of person but don't like to use photoshop.  The K30 gives me great lattitude in creating wonderful images that can be created right in the camera.  It has about 20 art filters that can be used.  You can combine filters or vary their intensity and effect.  Thanks to this camera I have portfolios of photographs that have wowed family and friends that have viewed them.  You can take very ordinary pictures and turn them into literally works of art with very litle experience.  The croping tool in this camera is far better than any other Nikon or Canon camera I have used.  I have no need for photoshop.  I hope that Pentax continues to expand the number of art filters in future camera models.  I would really like to see an oil paint filter.The other functions in the K30 work equally well.  It doesn't have the heft and solidarity of the K5, but is lighter and easier to handle.  It also costs a great deal less.Of all the cameras I have purchased, I find myself drawn to the K30 more than any of them.

After looking at similarities, differences, pros, and cons, I realized I could get a lot for my money by going with Pentax. The Pentax K-30 includes most of the features one would expect on a higher-end camera (minus the top LCD), and takes great quality photos. I've only had this camera for about a week, and I've realized unless you are doing large prints, this camera is GREAT. I don't need 20+ megapixels, especially when this camera yields some very sharp images. Even cropping the image quite a lot, the images look great. I hear a lot of people show their dislike of the design of the Pentax K-30, but i love how it looks. The build quality is good. The only thing I am not fond of is the Body Cap.

I bought it in mid-April of 2013. I am not a Pentax partisan, or at least I wasn't when I bought it: I made the decision based upon a comparison of features with other, similarly-priced cameras at the time. The deciding factors were the weather sealing, the in-camera stabilization and the low-light performance, all of which have lived up to the reviews and my expectations. I also like the idea of at least partial backward compatibility with most existing Pentax lenses from pre-digital days, although I haven't had the money to take advantage of that yet.I haven't used the video function at all and it isn't important to me, so I can't speak to that. This review is mostly intended for people who aren't experienced DSLR hands -- if you are one, you already know everything I do and more.I got the body (black) with the weather-sealed 18-135mm lens because I didn't see any sense in buying a weather-sealed camera with a non-sealed lens, and I wanted the extra reach over the 18-55mm kit lens. I'm glad on both counts that I didn't go with the less expensive option, and now that the body prices are dropping with the release of the next model, the K-50, I would recommend the better lens to everybody.I'm still learning about the camera's features and how to use them but even as a complete DSLR novice, I was able to start taking good pictures pretty much right out of the box.  The menu system seems complicated initially but if one starts with the simpler settings and progresses from there, it's easy to learn. The manual is comprehensive and comprehensible, and the Pentax Forums web site (not affiliated with the manufacturer) has been really helpful as well for getting the most out of the camera.Physically, the camera suits me well. I have relatively small hands and have no difficulty with the grip or the weight even with the larger lens. The controls are reasonably well laid out, and I've had no problem with accidentally changing settings while shooting, or with fumbling around to change things when I want to. The viewfinder is comfortable and the 100% crop prevents any surprises -- you get what you see, for good or for ill. I don't use the lcd screen to shoot very often, but haven't had any problems with it other than in very bright sunlight or at awkward angles.There are no other weather-sealed DSLRs at this price. I like taking pictures in the rain and at the beach, so keeping water and sand out of the camera and the lens are big deals for me. I haven't been really adventurous yet, but I've had the camera out in the rain and at the beach, including one thorough salt-water soaking, with no problems. I get a little kick from watching owners of other cameras scurrying back from the waves or rushing to get their gear put away in the rain.At this point I'm usually shooting in the mode that lets me set the aperture and shutter speed while the camera sets the ISO. At first, though, I used the auto setting almost exclusively and generally got good results. I use the image stabilization all the time because I don't have the steadiest hands, and after experimenting with it off a few times I find that it makes an enormous difference at lower shutter speeds.The picture quality is very good. 8x10 prints from my semi-decent printer look great. The native size of the images is 13.6\" x 20.5\", and while I haven't seen prints that large I would expect well-executed shots to be usable at full size. That's with my decent but not great lens; I would expect better lenses to yield better results.The camera does really well in low-light situations. Particularly when shooting in the RAW format, it's possible to retrieve very good detail from poorly-lit shots despite the increase in noise over well-lit ones. I haven't figured out how to use a flash to best advantage yet, so it's good to have a camera that performs well without the additional light and in situations where one doesn't necessarily want to announce one's presence.Speaking of announcing one's presence: the lone drawback that I know for sure isn't a product of my own lack of experience is that the camera is pretty loud. It's noticeably noisier than my friend's Nikon D-7000, for instance. In normal environments that's not a problem, but I have drawn a few glances in quiet surroundings. Using live view with the screen, the mirror raises and lowers twice (depending on the autofocus settings) so you get twice the noise. This shouldn't be much of an issue unless you're doing candid shots in close quarters or taking close shots of shy creatures, but it is a thing, and I've felt a bit intrusive sometimes when out shooting on the street or beach.I shoot mostly landscapes, flowers and people. I haven't done much action shooting so I can't speak to how well the camera will handle things like football (whether US or the rest of the world) and basketball and such. I have gotten some good surfing/bodyboarding shots. (To view some of my results, see flickr.com/photos/honolala)I would advise getting a spare battery -- I got this one: Pentax K30 Digital Camera Battery Lithium Ion (1200 mAh 7.4v) - Replacement For Pentax D-Li109 Battery -- and the AA adapter just in case. I've gone more than 400 shots before changing the battery and have yet to drain one, but I don't use the flash or the LCD very often. I also recommend getting the fastest memory card you can, and carrying a spare. I got two of these SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s SDSDX-016G-AFFP cards.The K-30 has a wealth of features that I haven't fully explored yet, but even without using it to its best advantage I'm able to capture some very satisfying images. The more I learn the better it gets. I heartily recommend it to anybody who wants the security that the weather-sealing provides along with a very good sensor and an easy-to-learn menu.

At current price levels it is excellent value for money and althnough rated as an intermediate level camera I would say its specs are very advanced.

The color, dynamic range and ease of use make this a total joy and a bargain compared to Canon's or Nikons. It has in-camera IS so lenses are cheaper and I got by with a Tamron 18-200mm all over Europe, inside dark churches and outside in the sunshine.You can get the technical aspects for other sources and reviews but from a Pentax user (K-x and K-5) I tell you this baby is sweet, durable, versatile and a joy to behold. It is hard on batteries and will not accommodate a battery grip but will take AA's with a separate adapter I purchased here. Pentax could have included one for good will but I also bought 2 extras so this is not an issue now.Again, can't say enough good things about this camera but be careful who you buy it from here. I got mine from The Portable Guy and when the price dropped $85 in 3 weeks from another vendor, they (and Amazon) would not give me a rebate as is standard policy here. Very poor of the Portable Guy and I would not do business with them.

It balanced well while hand-holding a Sigma 120-400 telephoto attached and the continuous shooting mode was spot on, making panning and stills all tack sharp. Pentax currently is fixing my K-5 and to be honest, I don't really miss it with this camera. In retrospect, I'd buy this one and get a nice 18-270mm lens and call it a day for 90% of my shooting requirements. The menu is sooo easy to go through that I was shooting 15 minutes before my buddy with a new Nikon 7100 had his ready to go.

I've brought it out in the rain to shoot multiple times, without a care in the world.-Backwards compatibility for lenses. I just got my hands on a 30 year old 50mm prime for all of $40.-Insanely fast shutter lag. Nearly on par with a 5DM3, which costs roughly 4x as much.-Buttons are all placed in an easy to use layout. I can operate this camera with gloves without too much issue.-The \"feel\" of the camera is fantastic, like you're holding something really well made.-Video feature is really convenient.

As such, my exceptional vintage SLR camera and all of its associated gear has gone neglected for quite some time.This camera has once again enkindled my love of photography.The Pros:This camera is able to accept practically all Pentax lenses dating back to the 1950's, provided you purchase an inexpensive adapter. If your lenses are already K-mount ready, you're good to go. Add the fact that the shake reduction technology lies in the body, and not the lens, and you can see why picking up some vintage glass (at much more reasonable prices) and placing it on this camera will give you exceptional results, on a very affordable budget.This camera is completely weather sealed. While this is hardly an invitation to treat your camera with wanton disregard, it also opens up a lot of possibilities for photos that you might never have had the opportunity to explore with a non-weatherproof model. Shots in the rain, snow, and sand are now fairly worry free.The cons:This is heavy. Seriously. It's very heavy when compared to nearly every other competitor's model in it's price bracket. This isn'tmuch of a deal breaker, considering it only weighs a few pounds with the case. But I wouldn't advise wearing it around your neck for any prologed length of time.Battery life: not the greatest. This camera is basically down for the count after about 400-500 exposures. If you shoot with the flash off and focus manually rather than using the servo-active lens, you might be able to prolong your battery life, but unless you only plan to have a short outing, I'd bring an extra battery pack with you.Overall:This is a no-brainer if you have existing Pentax Gear.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Jeriame Zenzayer \"jzenzayer\"", "ReviewID": "R1QGKCIE01CCU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on this camera before buying it as a gift for my wife, and although I have yet to test the weather resistance (bought a WR lens to match), I am impressed with the level of detail, sharpness, clarity, and color vibrancy.

After shooting a bit with the 18-135 indoor, I realize that although the lens is versatile, as I am learning more about lenses and their capabilities, I think it may have been wise to go with a body only price and purchase a low F-stop lense between 25-50 MM.  As I am learning, and most of you may already know, you need a lower F stop in low light, which lowers the Depth of field but captures more light.  When shooting indoors (kids and sorts) there is movement and to capture that clearly you need to jack up your shutter speed to 1/50-120 that dampens the light and the only other way to compensate is a lower f-stop or higher ISO.  ISO dramatically reduces clarity which you are paying for; but the only other option is to slightly over expose and lower f-stop.  Hence, the need for low f-stop lens which brings me back to the fact that it may be wise to buy body only and add a prime (fix length) lens of 35MM at a 2.0F which would be very versatile for family shots whoever you don't have the zoom flexibility. Just a thought.  Great camera other wize, I like the OS, very easy to use after some research.

I took a step back in the digital age, figuring that most everything I shot was going on the Internet. Having owned a couple cameras with swiveling LCDs and large optical zooms (Casio QV8000sx and Canon Powershot S2 IS), I really appreciated the ability to shoot from strange angles, but didn't like the drop off in picture quality at the edges of the frames. It was painfully obvious when stitching together panoramas. I was ready for the optics of a true DSLR. I really thought the swivel LCD would be a necessity. OTOH, I had four lenses left over from my 35mm days when I owned two Pentaxes (K1000 and H1a). I had read that they still worked. Tough decision.I decided to try the Pentax and I'm glad I did. The LCD viewing angle is very wide. The only place I miss the swivel is directly overhead. My wife and I do a lot of car touring. I drive; she captures memories. With the weatherproofed modern lenses she can point and shoot from our roadster in sun and downpour. When we're not driving, I get creative and play with the manual settings and my old lenses. I adapted to the controls quicker than I did on the Canon S2 IS, so I guess that means they are intuitive, at least to me.The only thing missing from my 30-year-old lenses is auto-focus and weatherproofing. OTOH, the Pentax, unlike most other DSLRs, has image stabilization built into the camera, not the lens, so I still have IS.I'd still like a swivel LCD for those rare occasions when I need to shoot over something really tall, but the other features far outweigh that rare circumstance.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for under 1,000 dollars", "Author": "Jason Best", "ReviewID": "RFM6UOHJF69HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great weather sealed camera for under one thousand dollars.

My husband and I do a lot of traveling and I like to take pictures, a lot of pictures. The Pentax-K30 has the features I need, such as dust resistance and water resistance (I can rinse the camera after taking pictures at the sea). I also bought a Pentax WR 18-130mm lens when I purchased the camera in April 2013. I didn\u2019t find out if the camera was really water resistant until on a recent trip to Page, Arizona.We were at a viewpoint called Horseshoe Bend when we got poured on by a summer monsoon rain. Knowing my camera was water resistant, I kept taking photos even as the rain came down. My husband has a Cannon Ti3 which he was using. He would tuck it under his rain jacket in between shots. Finally while taking a rest under a covered shelter I noticed that my camera would not turn on. I replaced the battery but still no luck. My husband\u2019s camera was still working even after getting wet.The next morning I turned on the camera and it worked but there was a large amount of condensation inside of the viewing screen \u2013 so much so that you couldn\u2019t see any image on the viewing screen. I had my husband take photos of just how much moisture was inside of the screen.My husband suggested that I send the camera back to Pentax to get it checked out. I was told by the Pentax repairperson that the camera was fine; that no water went in. I asked why the screen got so foggy. He said it was the condensation from the temperature. You can look at the photo and judge for yourself if this is condensation from temperature change (Not able to paste photo on review).In my opinion this camera isn\u2019t the water resistant camera it claims. My husband had better luck with his camera which isn\u2019t water resistant and took better photos. The service wasn\u2019t that great either. Why didn\u2019t my husband camera get this bad of \u201ccondensation\u201d while my \u201cwater resistant\u201d camera did and we were in the same location.

The camera handled very well, the controls were easy to use, and the screen was sharp and bright.  I was buying this to upgrade my Canon SX40 which takes excellent pictures for its class, but I wanted something a bit better.After taking some shots with the standard lens that comes on this camera at both 18mm and 55mm, with and without a flash, at various shutter speeds and f-stops on automatic and various manual controls I put them up on my computer to check them out.  To my surprise at large magnification the photos were not super sharp.  This was very surprising to me.  I compared them to shots of the same subjects around my house taken with the SX40 and found the SX40 pictures were just as sharp or sharper.Very disappointed, I returned the camera for a Canon T5i with an 18 - 135 lens.  Of course, I immediately tested the Canon against the shots I had taken with the Pentax and I found the Canon photos on extreme magnification were sharper than the Pentax.  I found these Canon T5i pictures to be superior to the SX40 shots I had taken as well; thus, I am satisfied with the Canon T5i.IF the Pentax pictures had been sharper I would have kept the camera.  The first true 35mm camera I ever had, about 35 years ago, was a Pentax and it was a wonderful machine.  This particular camera may have been flawed; however, I wasn't going to go around waiting for repairs on a brand new camera.  Plus, I couldn't be sure that after the repairs or even a new Pentax would work any differently than the one I had.  I need to stress that I am being picky about the sharpness of the pictures; however, at these price levels I expect the camera to work better than the SX40 when it comes to good photo resolution.  The color in the photos was fine.One other problem was the automatic focus.  The Canon is much superior in that department.  The T5i focuses immediately and without problems even on a relatively flat surface.  The Pentax searched when trying to focus on nearly flat surfaces and that became annoying very quickly.AD2", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pentax K-30", "Author": "Curt Kipke", "ReviewID": "R36BHGR3GRDUYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

I live in Poland and  I don't know to I qualify to the cashback promotion. Before the order I was calling to pentax cashback consumer hotline.  Someone from the Pentax support told me: \"You can ordered this camera to Poland, this promotion cover all European Union (also Poland) and You will receive money when You purchase Pentax dslr K-30 body\". After that I ordered Pentax K-30 DSLR body. Camera came before  the Christmas. Next I sent completed letter with invoice and claim form to Pentax (before 15 January 2013). Two months later, I had no answer (money on the account).  I wanted to know where's my Money. I sent a few e-mails and I called to dedicated hotline number. After exchanging several emails I got the answer: Your claim has been rejected, cashback not cover you ...\" I do not know who works in the company...  Some incompetent people work on the support line. If i knew that the promotion does not include people from Poland, I would choose another DSLR manufacturer . If  the warranty service looks the same, I regret that I chose pentax company... I could buy a Nikon d5100 (or another camera) - the same CMOS sensor, but the price much lower. For the saved money I can buy better lenses. Everybody knows the dslr camera body is not important, but the lenses. I could consider the Canon 600D, although I know that in Poland they have a good warranty service (I fixed compact camera). In conclusion Pentax K-30 is not a bad camera, but I would not recommend this company for the approach to the client. I regret, because I feel cheated.

It is an EXCELLENT VALUE for those looking for a more durable and versatile \"entry level\" camera.  Some things I did love are the weather resistance (WHEN YOU HAVE WEATHER RESISTANT LENS), excellent options and image quality.  If you have no previous DSLR experience or only Pentax experience, then this may be an excellent option, but those who are used to a different set of rules may be left displeased and frustrated.Some things I did not love were that you have to pop up the flash yourself when you want to take a flash picture or might need one, it does not pop up on its own.  I found that it was also quite loud both in lens focus and the shutter compared to my D3100.  I also do NOT like the auto setting at all.  To me auto should mean give the monkey a camera (or in this case, my husband) and let him take the pics.  The reason this stinks is that it auto detects your environment, chooses a \"scene\" and you can get some odd settings (especially when using a flash) that make hand held shots not practical.  Well guess what, sometimes the monkey wants to take a shot in a darkish room and needs a flash.  I called regarding this and they disagree with what my interpretation of what Auto should mean.  Also an extra battery is a must, this battery is too small for this camera.  Thankfully they are cheap batteries.  I also am underwhelmed with the choices in lenses that are weather resistant and affordable.  There are practically no hidden jewels like I have found in other lines.All in all, it IS a good camera, don't get me wrong.  I might feel differently if this was my first DSLR and was not switching from a brand I have used for ages and am very familiar with.  I tried REALLY hard to love it, but I did not.I decided to return it though and upgrade my Nikon to the D7000, since my existing lenses for that line were already weather friendly and outstanding.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice appearance, but...", "Author": "Kenny G \"REAGP\"", "ReviewID": "R1SH4TY6MKTQ6I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not a novice nor an expert, and it is mandatory to use a camera all day long in my business and sometimes it takes me out into inclement weather conditions and I literally wore my last Kodak DC5000 out as it too was a water resistance camera.

But, I need simplicity and I don't want to have to keep searching in the Menu for what I want to do. I found this camera to be one of the most complicated cameras I have ever used. It is NOT user friendly and I repeat NOT user friendly. Don't buy this camera for simplicity and it is not what they tote this camera to be and that is unfortunate. Don't let the looks or the price deceive you. I had this camera for 10 days and I really tried to make it work, but I ended up sending it back to Amazon and thanks to Amazon for their return policy. The only thing good about this transaction was Amazon - I got every cent spent refunded to me, but I really wanted this camera to \"be the one\" and I ended buying a Nikon that does the job, but lacks the water resistant feature that this camera has.
