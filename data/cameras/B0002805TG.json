First and foremost, it takes incredible pictures.  I've had prints made and they look just as good as the ones from my old 35 millimeter, if not better.  The Nikon 5200 is compact and lightweight, but not so small that it's uncomfortable to handle.  It's easy to use and has a large LCD screen for you to preview your pictures right away.  The zoom is also pretty good, although it took me a little while to figure out how the enhanced digital zoom works.There are a bunch of different shooting modes that you can choose from, and they're very easy to figure out.  I've been very impressed with the battery life, too, and that's a big selling point for me.All in all, this is a fabulous camera.  I suggest shopping around for it online, though, because I was able to find it selling for about $150 under the MSRP (brand new).", "Date": "September 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nikon gets it!", "Author": "J. Cleveland", "ReviewID": "R2VPWF5ZZ6P0T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While looking for a pocketable and powerful digital camera I tried out the Pentax 555, Optio, Sony T-1, Canon S500...and the Nikon 5200. And the 5200 simply takes the highest honors and my hard-earned cash--$410 from AMPhoto.com! While each of the cameras I compared and tested are small and pocketable-the Nikon was the easiest to reach in/pull out and \"know\" which end you have-which is important when catching spur-of-the-moment pictures at parties or other events. The grip and feel in the hand is great and can easily be operated one-handed-unless you have very small hands. The display is bright and easy to read-even in regular sunlight. The auto-gain for the display the camera uses while \"looking\" at a dark area is ingenious and incredibly useful. Controls/buttons are well-placed and thought-out. The menu system is great and very intuitive-no guessing/digging for features in menus. Pictures simply are wonderful. Contrary to other reviews-I have had no issues with color being off for people. This is a FAST CAMERA. Start-up is under 2 seconds. Without the flash picture-to-picture time is just over a second. With the flash picture-to-picture time is about 2 seconds. Nobody has talked about about how FAST the zoom is! While looking at the other cameras I thought all zooms were lethargic-but Nikon's zoom is incredibly F-A-S-T!!! I did heavily consider the Pentax 555 but its zoom was so lethargic that I'd miss the action before it zoomed all the way in! Macro mode is a blast and VERY good. The focus for macro is as close as an inch which allows you to get up close and personal with the object/subject The movie mode is just incredible! While not camcorder quality, the 640x480 30 fps rate is great and a lot of fun for clips. I don't know why other camera manufacturers put limitations on the amount of video you can take...but Nikon gets it-if you've got the memory the use all you want for whatever you want! Battery life hasn't been an issue and the fast charger which is INCLUDED lives up to the promise of fully charging a dead battery in 2 hours. I do wish Nikon had included the AC adapter but no matter...it can easily be picked up for $30. I would recommend BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY! They are small and light-and you'll definitely be taking lots of pictures with this baby, and while battery life is good-the last thing you want to do is run out of juice when the party is just getting started! Also buy as much SD memory as you can afford! **Please note-this is a point-and-shoot camera with a few advanced features to play and have fun with... it takes the guesswork out of pictures. While the camera has a host of features to help you take better pictures based on the situation and lighting, it does not prevent or protect the user from taking bad or poorly composed pictures. Read the manual for the basics then get out there, take lots of pictures and find out how to improve yourself!", "Date": "July 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Reasonably good with a few glitches", "Author": "Bobby", "ReviewID": "R3MYD0TRSOIO4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon Coolpix 5200 is my first digital camera, bought after siginificant web research. I used SLR cameras in the past and was initially reluctant to use digital point-and-shoot. After having used this new camera of mine, I must agree it is not bad at all. Let me list down some positives and negatives that I have noted so far:Positives:  1. Very light weight. When I compare with my friend's Canon A85, etc. this one is really light.  2. Clear picture, nice color balance. Quality lens.  3. Decent battery life + rechargeable battery.  4. Great look, nice design. You feel proud.  5. In-built Red Eye.Negatives:  1. The auto focus is not up to the mark. Unless you are very careful, there is a high chance you will land up in out-of-focus shots.  2. The potrait mode comes with default Red-Eye reduction and you cannot permanently change it. The problem with Red Eye reduction is that several flashes are triggered and wastes battery life. Note that you don't necessarily need Red Eye for all potrait shots. So for every shot you need to change the mode to single-flash.  3. Too many modes unnecessarily create confusion. Pictures taken in different modes not necessarily are different.  4. In-built Red Eye works, but not always. I have got quite a few Red Eyes even using Red Eye reduction mode.  5. 3x optical zoom is barely enough.A few tips on purchasing digital camera:  1. Don't go by the megapixel bandwagon. I rarely use the 5 megapixel feature of this camera and almost always use it in 2 megapixel mode to store more shots in my 128 MB flash.  2. 2 megapixel shots are good enough for up to 8x10 enlargements.  3. A good camera is defined by its lens, metering ability, focusing, zoom, low distortion, color balance, etc. They come from the digital processing and the lens function.

From the start this was an easy camera to operate. I was taking pictures right out of the box. After spending some time to read about it's other capabilities, I learned that there are some super cool things it can do.  The \"sport\" mode is wonderful. I can take a picture of a golf swing, my son pitching, or any other action shot with a series of 21 pictures in rapid succession. You get to see the progression of the action through each frame.  The Movie mode is also cool. It is very easy to move from pictures to movies. You don't have to be a member of Mensa to maneuver through the options.

As it turned out, the camera is very competitive with others and takes great pictures.Pros:- Color - I had a Minolta and a Pentax before this and the Nikon provides the best color saturation and true color. The Minolta had a habit of making everyone look slightly red and the Pentax made darker skin people look even darker.- Design - although not as shirt pocketable as the Minolta Dimage X, the new Canon SDs or the Pentax Espios, it is still pretty compact.  The \"handle\" on the right side of the camera makes it easier to hold, but makes it a little bulkier than the other cameras- Flash - a decen flash for a camera this size.  Some of the others I have used can't illuminate anything more than 6-8 feet away.  This camera can go a little farther and wider.- Lens - a true Nikon lense, you can see the difference in the clarity and when playing with the \"depth of field\"Cons:- Pictures can be soft - They look great at 4x6 prints, but you can tell a little fuzziness on a large LCD monitor.

The first thing that struck me was the smooth design compared with the rather chunky 3700, 4300 and 2100. The main reason is the new grip and battery compartment - a vast improvement. The pictures are faultless for amateur use, the lens is above average (somewhat distorted in the edge), much better than the Canon 500, and on par with the Pentax 555.The menu system is very intuitive and easy and most importantly the recycle time is comparable to normal cameras - it has always annoyed me when I have to wait for a digital camera to be ready for the `Kodak moment', no such problems with this Nikon.

I have two Nikon SLR cameras already, so I decided to go once more with Nikon for my first digital camera.  I bought an extra battery (batteries take 2 hours to charge, but battery life is good), a 512 mb card, which holds a LOT of pictures, and a camera case.  Most of my pictures have turned out pretty good.  I have had a few that were blurry.  I have also had some reddish skintones, but by trial-and-error, I have come to the conclusion that it was from poor indoor lighting.  The red-eye feature is great, but if your kids more around as fast as mine do, using this feature slows the shutter speed, and you miss the actual picture you were trying to get!  I think the few minor problems I have found with this camera  are due to my mistakes. I have yet to try out several of the other features.

Navigation in and between menus is straightforward and comfortable. On-screen display is great. The camera also has lots of \"modes\", which are presets of configurations designed for common photo opportunities.Cons:- First and foremost, *Really Bad Focusing System*. Unless you're an experienced photographer (and then again, even if you are), you may lay to it that this camera will take allot of getting used to. Blurry, out-of-focus pictures are common, and you're going to have to repeat shots until you get the hang of it. This is a major issue in comparison to other cameras I've been using.- Mediocre automatic flash system. When using \"automatic flash\", in many cases the camera flashes unnecessarily, creating over-brightened images.

After 2 years I'm on my 3rd one & Happy!", "Author": "Olaf Johnson", "ReviewID": "RJQDIR1QF9NGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a few cameras since the digital age submerged the photo world in a sea of memory cards, megapixels and jpegs. I went from a horrible  1 MP Vivitar, to a great but really slow 4MP Minolta/Konica Camera, then to this Nikon 5200 in 2004. Initially, I was weary about buying a 5MP camera, since the technology advances and becomes cheaper within the space of a few months, but the 5200 was not the case. After the first year my first one was stolen and I decided to try out the really slim 6MP Casio Exilim s500 and I was quickly disappointed with picture quality, durabilty and start up speed, before exchanging it for my 2nd Nikon 5200. Last month after 1 year and half of consistently rough usage the battery door came loose and then stopped connecting at all. Even though the battery is still secure without the door there I wanted a new camera and was planning to upgrade to the $1700 Canon 30D, but after playing with the 30D instore, I decided I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment and realized I was genuinely happy with the Nikon 5200. I played around with newer models as well and found that the Nikon 5200 is still a top camera for taking awesome pics in a wide variety of settings and delivering sparkling prints. So I just purchased another Nikon 5200.PROS: 1. Above all, this camera is really fast. That is my favorite feature. With other cameras I find that the start up and picture to picture speed is slow enough that you can miss many great picture opportunities whiles waiting for the camera to warm up.2. Great Pictures in all ranges & conditions. I used this camera outdoors whiles on backpacking & mountaineering trips and always came back with great pics. Macro/Micro/close-up pics are awesome as well. I mainly use that mode for taking pictures of stuff I'm selling on eBay and I've gotten many of compliments from bidders on the quality of the pictures.3. Long battery life. I usually fill up 1GB worth of pictures before the battery meter flashes that 50% power is remaining. After 2 years of lots of use the battery's stamina does dimish some like all electronics using lithium batteries.4. Durable; I've dropped my 2nd one many times, used it in rain, snow, sleet, at the beach and it looks like it been thru war but works like new.5. The Auto Picture mode actually works because the base of the camera is wide & flat enough to sit on ledges, tables, etc... so you can take many self pics where ever you go. I find slim style cameras (which is now the style of about 90% of mainstream cameras) fail at this unless you tote around a tripod.6. Dynamic Flash Modes actually work. Also the Scene modes are easy to use once you understand what does what.7. Video Mode has really loud sound recording and you can take unlimited length clips depending on you memory card'c capacity.8. Nice package in box. Comes with alot a good stuff, software, cables etc.CONS:1. Weak battery door clip-in points. Most cameras have this weakness and its not inherent to any one brand. Most cameras' battery door have weak hinges which is alot worse than the weak clip-in points for the 5200's battery door that eventually wears down or break off after a few years of rough use. But in the 5200 defense the battery has its own internal sliding lock that holds it in place so the door in not even necessary to begin with. Also the way the door clip in points breaks is better than having the hinge break because its easier to fix with tape (or glue if you are skilled).2. Learning the various camera modes and figuring out what does what takes some time only because the modes actually work (meaning every mode will give a different picture), and there are a lot of scene modes.Especially when it comes to taking nighttime pictures, unless you are a genius with cameras expect to spend a few weeks to a month perfecting night pics on this camera. They are a few modes for night where you have to determine if you are in normal, party, fireworks, or dusk night then you have to figure out if you want the flash or not, then after that if you choose flash you have to figure out what flash mode you want(party, sunset, fill-in, macro) . The positive thing is when you learn the sweetspots you will find that this camera takes really good night pictures a big positive that is lacking in many reviews.3. Battery Charging. Not really a con as much as it is my griping. I just wished the battery charged like a cellphone/iPod instead of having to travel with the separate charging plug cable & battery charger-block.4. No Sepia or BW filter modes! However the software that comes with the 5200 enables conversion to these filters.BOTTOM LINE: If you getting a 5 megapix camera that you want to last a long time and take great dymnamic pictures get this one! It is also on Steve's Digicams ultimate \"BEST Camera\" list(On the list it is refered to as the Nikon 5600which is a European version that uses 2 regular AA batteries instead of the lithium ones that the 5200 has, other than that they are the same cameras.)", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "David W.

It's perfect for me.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't believe they are still around!!", "Author": "MiserableOldFart", "ReviewID": "R1JRS42DW71RYB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This must have been a very successful camera to still be in the retail chain, unless there are just a lot of leftovers.  I have had this camera for six years.  It takes sharp pictures.  Does a very creditable job with video, and amazingly the sound quality is awesome.  It's small, handy, and pretty ruggedly built, though, thankfully I haven't put it through any unusual ordeals.  The downside is that interior pictures have a lot of distortion. This is more of a point and shoot type camera and will likely disappoint those who are moving from a film SLR, especially younger people.  As I get older, I am less fussy about trying to get THE great photo, but I still would love to see better quality.  The newer cameras have higher pixel ratings, but I would look for more serious SLR type lenses on the things.  Yes, more megapixels are a good thing, but unless you have less distortion in interior shots, you're not going to really make much better use of it.  This is a great camera to have around and handy because of its size and lightness, but I'd look for something with a bigger and more serious lens for any kind of serious work.  I'm quite amazed that the price is still where it is.  I would have thought that after six years this would be a fifty dollar camera.  Yes, I paid a lot more than the current price, but it was six years ago, and I would have thought that the digital camera world would have moved on a very great deal from then.  If you are a young family looking for some nice shots of the baby, and want something handy, this might be a good choice.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!!

My pictures have turned out great!The program it comes with to edit your pictures has a great email feature...  It automatically reduces the size of the picture from 5MP (or whatever you took the picture in...) to 640x480 for easy and quick emailing.  It sends the picture(s) directly to your email software.I have only 2 problems with the camera...(1) you can't rotate pictures on the camera.  If you take a picture lengthwise, usually a camera (like many Cannon and many Sony cameras) will have a feature that allows you to rotate the picture so you can view it without holding the camera sideways.  Nikon should have added this simple, but useful feature.  You can, however, rotate the pictures once you upload them to Picture Project before emailing them.  But, it takes time to go through each photo and make sure it is positioned correctly for email, but at least you can  do it so people don't have to lay their heads on their desks to view your pictures!(2) the Picture Project software that comes with the camera makes it very easy to post your pictures to Nikon's website, but it takes alot of time to post your pictures to (for example) Ofoto.com or Sams's Club.com.  Both of those companies print cheap digital prints (Ofoto is .29 cents and Sam's Club is .18 cents per print)... I think Nikon.net's price was .45 cents per print (no thanks!).A BIG plus to buying this camera is their technical online help.  They were GREAT!!!  I emailed my questions about my two \"problems\" above and they emailed me back with solutions within 3 days and it was FREE!  I can wait up to 3 days for an answer if it is free.  No problem!!All in all I think this is a GREAT camera and I would purchase it again even with the two MINOR problems I've had!!  It was even rated \"Editor's Choice\" in a few magazine's.

No other cameras I have experience with is anywhere close to its 2,5 pics per second (you'll probably need a good quality SLR to match this). If you, like me, plan to take action pictures (skiing, etc.), no other compact camera is better.The picture quality is very good, and the \"red eye-fixer\" is working allmost perfectly (I think I've seen red eyes ONCE during my first couple of hundred pics). The user friendlyness is also very good, logical and easy to understand, even for me that have little prior experience with Nikon.The only downside with the camera is the screen size which does not match many of today's new cameras. Besides the size the screen is good, with excellent visibility in most situations.

We started to see problems when shooting in sunlight. The screen on the Sony was much more readable. Like 30-40% better readability. Ok , now for the bad news.. The Nikon's color is way way off for pictures of people. What amazes me is all the reviews that get done are with pictures of frogs and flowers. How about most people take pictures of people. The skin tones on the Nikon 5200 Are terrible. Skin looks pink and burned. Not very real at all. Way to redish pink and not natural even a little bit. This was with flash on and off in both indoors and outdoors shots. The sony pics were much more true to life.

Practically impossible to get a clear, focused picture inside, and when I do get a picture that is technically focused, it just isn't very sharp.

I called Nikon and they said to take it back.  The second one took decent quality photos, but not only was there a pixel out on the display (which would be okay if the camera wasn't $525), but there was also a defect on the ocular viewfinder which showed as a \"warped\" area in the form of a line right across the center.I have a Kodak DC290 2.1 MP that is about six years old and it takes much sharper pictures that this Nikon.  I was really shocked by the lack of overall quality control (two cameras defective) and the lack of sharp images.
