I have found that the battery  life is best when I use NiMH rechargable batteries. I carry an extra set at  all times.  Using the highest quality image setting and a 30 MB flashcard,  I can get about 45 shots.  I use flash quite a bit for interior shots, and  this of course reduces battery life just a bit.  I don't quite trust the  wimpy little wrist strap, so usually I use a camera bag or my pocket (One  of the reasons I bought it was the compact size, compared to other digitals  in the price range). I also purchased several auxiliary lenses - a super  wide angle and a couple of close-up lenses - from Kodak, and find them  quite useful.  For my work, being able to date stamp is essential, although  I suppose all digitals probably allow date/time stamping.  My major  criticism is the lack of recovery time after taking a shot.  The longer the  batteries have been in use, the longer the wait.", "Date": "November 1, 1999"}, {"Title": "With this digital camera I gave up my film cameras!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2OZI9KW2XJFOL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my DC260 for about 9 months now and I have been very pleased with the results. The pictures are every bit as good as a good point and  shoot...without the film expense!I print a lot of 4x6 prints from the  camera on my HP Photosmart printer and you cannot tell them from a good  35mm print. Well actually you can....the prints from my DC260 and printer  are better!I bought Ni-MH batteries and charger and they are a MUST. I  don't have problems with the batteries draining too fast with the N-MH.  Another must have is a USB ScanDisk compact flash card reader. It's  lighting fast and saves camera batteries since you just pop the card from  the camera and then download to your PC. You need the fast download you get  from the USB because you will take a LOT more pictures with a digital  camera. There is one last MUST have and that's MSPicture-it2000. I have  just about all the photo programs...but the only one I loaded on my new  computer was Picture-it.The only negative to the camera is that it takes  a little long to process mulitple pictures...this camera is not for quick  action shots!I have been VERY happy with my digital camera and my  \"digital darkroom\" setup.", "Date": "October 27, 1999"}, {"Title": "Lots of drawbacks", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2HM0XVOHI5O01", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Yes, it takes great pictures, but there are several things I'd change about it.  First, don't trust the wrist strap to hold the camera.  My broke in a matter of days and the camera plummeted to the ground.  It's extremely  flimsy for and $800 camera.  Second, there is a one-second delay between  the time you push the shutter button and the time the camera takes the  picture.  This is extremely annoying for users of traditional cameras that  respond the instant you activate the shutter.  It makes candid shots nearly  impossible.  Third, the camera is ridiculously clumsy to hold.  It's not  built to fit the human hand at all.  The user's thumb naturally lands on  the LCD screen, which is very difficult to clean after ; the camera fall  over too easily when standing on its base; it's very easy to drop.  Fourth,  the LCD screen is hyped as a great feature:  well, what Kodak fails to tell  you is that using the LCD screen while the camera's running on batteries  causes the batteries to overheat and freeze the camera until the batteries  return to normal temperature.  Yes, the camera takes great pictures, but  you'll probably be disappointed by everything else wrong with it.", "Date": "August 2, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent pictures but battery life absolutely poor", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3DKZRNQAHX1WD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the DC260 for almost a year and the pictures are 100% fabulous! no complaints there...

When the camera is  plugged into the computer (USB port), the drive letter appears in windows  explorer.  You can then simply navigate and use the standard cut and paste  tools to move the files.  I am extremely impressed with the qualitiy of the  pictures, ease of use, and clear instruction manuals.  The camera does eat  the batteries.

Three  cameras and all have the same problem - not good!  Not exactly the best  design either - clumsy to hold and awkward to use - not much thought went  into the design of this particular model while other Kodak models seem  better designed... not smart for the \"top of the line!\"No  wonder Kodak discontinued this model.

Not only can I can share photos with friends by e-mail, but I can crop small parts of the photos and these parts become great images in their own right.

I recommend buying and using a 32 meg flash memory with the 8  meg as a back-up.  I also like that the camera can connect to my  computer's USB port because my LPT1 port was already over-used.
