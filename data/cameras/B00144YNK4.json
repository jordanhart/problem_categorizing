Best camera still", "Author": "Frank Frank \"Frank\"", "ReviewID": "R14YWV5OF6R7OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best! An oldie but a goodie. First off it is an unbelievable 24mm ultra wide. Can't beat that.But the amazing feature is this camera has an option to PAUSE video! Saves hours versus editing. Seems like a little feature, but virtually no other cameras have this. Perfect for real estate photos and videos. Love this classic. The price actually went UP when they stopped making them.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.5 Megapixels, 1/2.33 CCD, up to 3,648 x 2,736 JPEG resolution, AVI (MPEG-4) Movie\n2.5 TFT LCD Display\nFocus Type - TTL auto focus (Multi AF, Center AF, Face Detection AF)\n1/1,500 - 1 sec.
