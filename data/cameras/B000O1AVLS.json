I am happy to convey this boffo little dynamo gives your steady hand way more bang than expected. As an avid diver & photographer I did a lot of research, wedged between some mecha-$1000s set up with strobes out to the sides like insect eyes - and the stoopid $20 disposable film jobbies I'd hobbled by with for years.Lucky to have found this camera; their (Intova) newer, more mega-pixeled versions could be better - I would not be surprised, given the overall workmanship, quality of build & performance I got. Caveat: 90% of my opinion is based on scuba pix in warm & clear tropical environments; however, the responsive convenience of the digital itself - sans housing - should not be overlooked. For a suave dinky 6MP point & shoot, the built-in flash functioned admirably, if sometimes pawn to close range (~<5 ft, better 3 ft & in) & victim of lens housing shadow casts. Used skillfully in conjunction with your natural light source, you can capture very decent color renditions below 40 ft. (\"photoshop\" up your reds). While Intova's labeled claim of 180 ft. wasn't challenged by me, I spent plenty of time >100 ft, & my IC600 negotiated >30 dives without so much as a hiccup. I did also attentively maintain my housing, well rinsed & clean, with good quality fresh silicone grease on my o-rings when I changed the batteries. By the way, the red filter accessory is too much (overtones) & not worth it.Two other tips - some may ponder ordinary \"alkaline\" vs rechargable batteries here; follow me & many other reviewers & use rechargeables ONLY. I got a sony 4-pk w/ wall charger & easily kept them going in&out; by 2's ~every other day with zero performance lapse (eg, 50-75 HQ photos per day +some videos, over 600 files in total; didn't barely fill half my card). To that end, I also added a better-quality \"fast\" 2GB SD card. Very curious if the processor reads an SDHC (since the specs don't say), but haven't tried.For what this camera costs versus what it delivers, it's 5-star, frankly. It is though an \"entry level\" option, and not meant to compete with those huge multi-eyed 12MP rigs fellows tote around. As at the start, sometimes we're lucky to get what we pay for, and MY IC600 to me is \"worth\" way more than I paid here on Amazon, that's for sure.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "David Herrington \"scubadave\"", "ReviewID": "R1KDWPKAYIKBRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very easy to use. The double o-ring ensures an airtight compartment with little or no hassle, particularly as compared to ikelite housings which are notorious for sealing problems unless you are very careful.

Not sure why, but the housing is cheaper than most others like it and you get a camera too!  I just got back from a diving trip to Honduras and the pictures are ok.  The closer you are to the surface, the better the pictures.  Alot of the photos were greenish-blue and not very vivid, but for the price you pay, it is an excelent way to remember a dive.  I would rather take another diving trip than pay for a camera, but that is just me.  The housing is very tough and didn't leak at all.  The screen is sometimes hard to see underwater, depending on the sunlight.  The camera is slow to take pictures, but you get used to it after a while.  I would definitely recomend getting a large memory card and rechargable batteries. (the disposable ones only last about one dive)  The functions are more than adequate and I enjoyed the video mode which also captures sound underwater!

A couple of notes, when shooting underwater you need to set it up in Program mode, for cloudy day and always use the flash.  The housing blocks part of the built in flash so you need to make or buy a diffuser.  I made one with a translucent plastic top off a can of nuts.  Attach it at the end of the lens opening on the underwater housing, I attached it with tie wraps.  You really have to be close to your subject (less than 3 feet) for the flash to light up the subject and deliver true colors.If you plan to get serious about underwater photography this is not the camera for you.  I will use it on casual dives when I just want a shot.  It is compact so you can kind of clip it on and forget it.A couple of downsides, it goes through the batteries in about 75 shots so a couple of dives and you need new ones or rechargeable ones.  The auto focus is slow so when you press the button it take a couple of seconds or 3 to auto focus, sometimes by then the fish is gone.Here is a link to some of my photos I took with the camera in Bonaire.[...]", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "A.J.", "ReviewID": "R1EPICD42NBS4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera works very well and has plenty of features.

I used thecamera on two dives.  We got down to a max depth of 57 ft. The cameraand housing worked well. I got several pictures of turtles. Since Iwas new to underwater photography I didn't realize that I should keepthe camera and housing cool between dives, so the camera was fogged upon the 2nd dive.

The waterproof housing worked great on two scuba dives down to 60 feet.  The camera has several nice features including a flash that works in auto, flash off, flash on, and red eye modes.  The flash is weak, and it has to be used close to your subject in clear water.  The photos are of nice quality.  You can experiment with white balance settings to give different color qualities underwater.  The housing allows for 46mm filters to be attached, although the 85B filter I used tended to give photos a green hue.  Intova offers an underwater filter that may or may not help.  Definitely use rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries with the camera as they last longer than regular batteries, which get eaten up fast.  The rear screen is hard to see through the housing in sunlight, but is slighty easier to read underwater.  This is the perfect underwater camera for the occasional scuba diver or snorkler who wants to see immediate results and preserve underwater sights with good quality photos.  The camera takes standard SD cards up to a couple gigabytes, and by taking numerous photos, you're bound to get a few keepers.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Intova INWD-IC600 Camera", "Author": "D.

The casing often got fogged up underwater so it was hard to see the screen to aim3. The resolution on the screen is not the best so I couldn't really tell if my pictures were good until I put them on my computerHowever, the camera only cost me $120 which is not bad at all for the quality.

If it were just any old camera on the market, I'd say pass it by without a second look...but it's not just any old camera.  For less than the price most companies charge for an underwater housing, Intova delivers both the housing and the camera.  This makes your decision a bit more complicated.  The first (and largest) problem is the battery life.  It's horrendous.  With alkaline batteries you'll get maybe a hundred pics.  With rechargeables (I use 2500mah), you'll be lucky to get a couple of dozen.  Intova recommends against using alkalines except for occasional emergency use (even though they ship two alkaline batteries in the box), and I've noticed that when you put alkalines in the camera, the screen glows lightly, even with the camera off.  The second problem is the time to take a picture.  If the camera isn't on when you see something you want to shoot, you can forget about it, especially if the shot requires a flash.  Time to first pic without a flash is about 15-20 seconds...and charging the flash requires an additional 20 or so seconds.  Even if you already have the camera on and the flash charged, getting your shot could be iffy, since it takes about 2-3 seconds to take a picture from a ready state.  The pictures themselves are generally fine.  The camera has a bit of noise in low-light situations, but most digital cameras do, these days.  It embeds Exif info, and you can choose image size and quality.  The video quality is sub-par at best.  It is over-compressed, noisy in low light and the sound tends to drop out every few seconds.  I suppose it works okay as an emergency video source, but don't expect to replace your camcorder.  Like I said, if this were just any camera sitting on the shelf at Target or Wal-Mart, I'd recommend passing it by without a second thought.  However, the inclusion of the waterproof housing changes things by giving this camera a niche.  The underwater housing is a high quality acrylic case with a double O-ring design and external buttons for all the functions.  It is not a glorified zip-seal baggie like many 3rd party \"cases.\"  It is rated at 180 feet.  It is easy to open and close, without any significant risk of accidental opening while underwater.  The only issue with the casing (and this is common to all underwater housings) is that the cold water could cause condensation and fogging inside the case.  The inclusion of the case with the camera for less than the cost of most manufacturers' cases alone makes this worth picking up *if you want or need an underwater camera*.  If you don't require the case, then I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for an everyday use camera.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "great bargain", "Author": "Ward S. Otake \"poopsicle\"", "ReviewID": "R1BV76NDLTSRXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've tried the IC600 out for a few dives now, and it works pretty well, especially for the price you pay.  As long as you're not expecting to get the same level of quality images as with a professional system, it really is a great bargain.  Very user friendly, it's perfect for an entry-level use underwater as well as having a pretty good digital camera out of the water.Pros: It's easy to use, the housing is solid with the two o-rings, image quality is fairly good in clear water, the price is outstanding, it records sound in video mode underwater, it is versatile with the removable housing for use dry or wet. Easy to turn on and off and change shooting modes in the housing even with gloves on.Cons: The shutter delay for still pictures is a little slow so it's a little tricky to take stills in rougher water, the screen is a little hard to see underwater in bright sunlight, the function buttons on the housing are a bit too close together to use effectively with gloves on, high power drain.Overall, the cons are sometimes irritating, but in my opinion they are pretty minor compared to the performance you get for the price.  If anyone has serious complaints, they probably should invest more $ in a higher-end system, their expectation are too high for what they're paying.Using a 2GB SD card is a must.  THe internal memory of the camera can hold 6 shots at fine qualty and 30 seconds of video.  THe SD card can hold 600 shots and 2 hours of video.  Also, the camea is often sold with the blue SD card.  The black SD has a higher transfer speed and seems to work better.One piece of advice from other reviews that I have to agree wholeheartedly with is to use at least 2400 mah rechargeable nimh batteries.  the camera will drain even duracell ultra AA batteries in one use, or even when playing around with the settings before you take it underwater.  I noticed in the instruction manual (on the page that explains how to install the batteries) there is a tiny, fine-print helpful hint that says nimh batteries are recommended, and regular alkalines are not recommended except for testing settings because \"they can degrade camera performance\"; probably due to the gradual power loss of alkalines.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good beginner camera for the price!", "Author": "Ann", "ReviewID": "R3JSQPO7F71GCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first underwater camera.

I usually end up taking 2 or 3 images of the same thing to make sure one is in focus.  The screen is also difficult to see under water, so you can't see if somethign was in focus or not.The camera appears to be an older model cannon powershot rebranded as Intova.  The picture quality is very good below and above water (though of course not DSLR quality) and the flash is sufficient for taking pictures from a few feet away on night dives.The case has worked fine so far with no hint of any problem.  On a trip, it's a good idea to leave teh case sealed as much as possible to keep moisture out and to only open it somewhere dry or air conditioned.  I've had problem occasionally with the area in front of the camera lens fogging on a dive as the air inside the case cools.Overall, this was a surprisingly good camera and case for the price.",

This is just a short run so you can see it works. I used a 2G memory card. Picture quality is not super but good and video run times depend more on the batteries. Use the 4x or 8x and your set. Diving you will find it easy to handle but hard to slip out of a BC pocket. Skiing it did well. I should just make mounts for it. Both camera and underwater case have the standard 1/4-20 tripod mount. There is a clicking sound when it tries to adjust either focus or lighting. I'm not sure which but for the price a very nice little starter. Again I use it all the time and it is only now starting to show some signs of use. All controls are there in the underwater case and even my big hands and 5mm gloves not a problem on the buttons. I am very happy with this product and actually am considering the big brother. Oh one thing, it likes light and so while pictures can be resolved with the extenral slaved flash (cost as much as the camera) my underwater cavern video isn't too good. But a great starter and I really recomend it for a good fist time system. Just a 2 GB memory card because I didn't see it but don't think it will take anything bigger.

All of my dive buddies have these elaborate cameras with strobes... sure they take better pictures but they are awkward and very expensive and rarely used because of there bulkiness. We have enjoyed my pictures 10 times as much because it's so compact I take it with me on every dive and as a result have taken some amazing pictures which have been sent to the local paper and TV stations who have broadcast them.

I was impressed with the quality of the images and the construction of the case with no leaks to 120 feet. Some things that I do not like are Very slow response time between taking the picture and the actual capture, the relatively poor battery life, and the high cost of the red filter.This is what I did for my next Dive in Belize. I purchased rechargeable batteries and memory cards and change them after each dive, and purchased the Red Filter which dropped in price. I Thought I either lost the filter adapter or was not included in the package and CALLED Intova and they sent another immediately (I paid for Postage)- Customer service is very good. I did eventually find the original so I now have an extra.I also run the camera in movie mode with the red filter on below about 20 feet and the images are good - not great! but good enough to run on my 58\" plasma to show the land lubbers what it looks like down below. The movie mode gets rid of the lag time in taking still pictures. I find that if I turn the camera on and set it to movie mode before I go under it is easier to take the video, just hit the shutter release button. The 2Gb flash memory card will last about 2 hours, almost about the same as a good set of batteries. The sound is also a bit of a bonus - even though I am hearing a bit of a background Buzzing noise.After seeing some fellow divers with Professional camera setups and knowing that my camera cost was less that half the cost of one of their strobes and seeing them struggling with their bulky gear, I feel that I made a good choice. It enabled me to enjoy my dive without the cumbersome equipment that others use. Granted my picture quality was not as good as more expensive camera systems but enjoyed my dive and have a great memory of my dive. I do highly recommend the camera to novice photographers like myself. I couldn't help notice that that the price almost doubled since I bought mine - but still worth it.

Leichtenschlag \"Dan L.\"", "ReviewID": "R1QPCB0N98RXOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera over a year ago and have photographed over 10 dives, probably 500 pictures.  It was one of the cheapest cameras I saw for fairly deep underwater photos so I thought I'd give it a shot as a first underwater camera.  Overall, this camera has exceeded my expectations.  Couple of specific points:1.  I read reviews of terrible battery performance, but while worse than a typical point and shoot, I've taken 100 shots and 10 minutes of video with Energizer rechargable 2450 Ma Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, more than enough for a two dive outing.  I carry a backup set and have never used them.2.  Only real complaint is that bootup and picture taking are a little slow.  You have to click the pic and hold for a good \"One 1 thousand\" before moving.  A little annoying, but you get used to it.3. Simple to use, but you'll have to memorize the buttons because it's impossible to read once inside the housing and underwater.  I assume any camera in a housing is going to be the same.4.  Picture quality doesn't seem that great when you initially review on the camera or view once pics are on your computer, BUT, if you get into photoshop (or some pic editing SW) and play with the contrast and tone, they look AWESOME!  E.g., I get into photoshop and batch autotone, autocontrast, and autocolor (set up a script for all 3) and the difference is simply astounding.  The originals that are somewhat washed out green/grey come to life with perfect color as I recall seeing it underwater, and look absolutely beautiful, 1000% better.  I don't know if this is the case with other cameras, but since the picture/color quality is NOT a problem with pics taken with this camera out of water, I'm thinking that almost any underwater photography will need editing.  I tend to modify all the pics I'm going to keep/post, so it's no big deal for me.  I wish I could post a pic here of a before/after of a 2 second tone/color/contrast change.5.

Putting the camera together and setting it up for taking pictures was very simple.  I followed the step-by-step instruction booklet. Putting the camera into the underwater housing was equally as simple and straight forward. I also installed a 2 gig memory card which was plug-and-play.  Underwater, this camera was lightweight and taking basic photos was very easy. Just point and click.  For close up photos, I found it difficult to use some of the buttons to focus and change camera settings as the buttons are small and very close together.  I also found that the view finder was very small. This made focusing on small fish and invertebrates on the sea floor difficult. I often found myself wondering if I had captured the image I meant to.  I found that I needed to get much closer to things than I'm used to, in order to see them in the view finder and take a picture.  Also, this camera eats batteries quickly.  I used 2 batteries a day taking pictures and afterward reviewing those pictures.  These are all problems that I think can be overcome with practice and the use of rechargeable batteries.  The quality of photos taken with this camera was excellent.  Viewing them on the computer was very easy.  I just plugged the camera into the USB port on my computer with the included cables. Connecting the camera to my computer is the best way to view the photos for deletion or saving to computer because the screen is much larger.  I think this camera makes an excellent starter camera.

That's really Amazon's fault not the camera.  I'm very happy with it.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked great for us", "Author": "William M. Hutchins", "ReviewID": "R1IXDZU7ZSICBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had originally bought this camera as a gift for my son who is an avid SCUBA diver to use this summer while in the Keys. Not long after I purchased it, his mother decided to buy him a more expensive camera so I ended up keeping this one for myself. We had scheduled a cruise on NCL out of Miami to Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay so I took the Intova with us. My son talked me into trying a 1-tank dive in Nassau and we took this little camera with us. We used the camera both below and above the water and was pleased with the results considering the price we paid. I would recommend this camera to others for it's simplicity, ease of use and results. Be aware that this was my first experience with underwater photography so I have no point of reference in that department but I am an experienced photographer above water. Another surprise was that the camera is equipped with AEB (auto bracket exposure) which is a great feature for any camera.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "It Worked Well With a Few Flaws", "Author": "J. Green", "ReviewID": "R1GIEXCHYK1DES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am overall VERY satisfied with my decision to buy this camera, and I highly recommend it.  I used this camera for 10 days while in Roatan, learning to dive.  I don't claim to be a pro at either photography or diving, so this is an amateur's opinion.  The good and the bad:The good:The camera housing kicks butt!  I found it easy to tap into all of the functions of my camera at various depths, and I changed between the Auto and Video mode frequently with nothing but success and ease.  I never saw water seap into the housing, and it is very sturdy and rugged.  My photos came out better than expected (in most cases).  The videos also came out better than expected, but I will admit to having low expectations for that function.  The price is unbeatable.  I was the envy of many experienced divers, and many wanted the pictures I took above and below the water.  I bought the diffuser and the red filter, and these accessories fit perfectly.  Many are bashing the diffuser, but I got shadows just about every time I did not use it.  I cannot comment on the red filter, as I noticed close up pictures were hurt by it while normal pictures were helped by it.The Bad:My strap broke on the first dive...I am still not sure how it broke, but I know that I did not do anything extrenuous to break it.  Some of my pictures came out bad in that they had some sort of digital discoloration.  I would say about 10-15% of the pictures had this problem.  I am not sure if it was user-error or camera malfunction, but I am going to blame both.  The spring on the flash/back button of the casing malfunctioned to where I was unable to use it on the last 2 days.All in all, the good outweighs the bad, and I think this is a great travel companion for those who want to remember their aquatic adventures.  I plan to have many more adventures, and this camera will definitely be among the first things packed.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for the Money", "Author": "Colleen Chatman", "ReviewID": "R2VFOE2IKGRZBV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice computer for the money.

It seems to take a good picture in and out of the water.  Problem, it's so bright in the pool that I have no idea what I'm taking a picture of.  You cannot see the LCD monitor in bright light.  Also, I agree with an earlier posting, the quality of the pic on the monitor isn't even close to the quality of the actual picture, so don't delete any pics until you've looked at them on your computer.  I've been practicing with choosing a spot above the camera and using that as my focal point.  Also, when the kids were in the pool, I had trouble with the shutter delay.  But I think that was more related to my being unsure if the picture I wanted was in the frame.  It won't be nearly as bright in the water when snorkeling so I think everything will work out fine.  I think I'm gonna enjoy the camera.  The only other concern I had was finding silicon grease.  I missed it on the Amazon site so I didn't order it when I ordered the camera.  Finally found it at Home Depot in the plumbing department.

And I did my research. I also found some recommendations on which settings to use. Using this the picture quality within five feet was excellent. In my experience with this camera, the water quality in Maui on my trip declined somewhat with distance, but with sufficient natural light, even at 25' the picture quality was good. But the lighting was very important.  It was good that this was a digital camera in that I could take a lot of pictures and dispose of most. These discarded shots were due to poor timing in shots of marine life as the camera's auto focus took considerable time to process. The second issue was shots taken at too great a distance given the visibility. And the third issue included shots taken while the protective case got foggy. This last issue is a bit complex. I took an estimated 50 - 75 shots per set of batteries (rechargable). But after I had to change them while on the beach, invariably the air in the case afterwards, mixed with the cold temperatures of the water caused condensation.  The other option for buyers are the new slim cameras that are water proof to 5' -12'or so. These are optimum conditions for underwater photography for most swimmers anyways. I would expect better auto focus speed. But I have not tested these. Good luck and happy hunting!", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Unerwater Camera", "Author": "C. R.

Used it three times and reviewed the pictues and they were some of the best we have had.  The 6 pixal must be what does it as we had a camera with 5 or less and the pictures seem much better.  I like the underwater housing and latch very well.  We had another camera and the latch was nothing like this one and ended up breaking. This one will hold the water out.  For the price, this is a great underwater camera or all weather camera.  The extra megapixal seems to make the difference.  We had one problem on our third time out.  Took a bunch of pictures and then noticed the lens had fogged up and it would not turn off.  Upon getting back to shore found the batteries were hot which evidently made the fog in the case.
