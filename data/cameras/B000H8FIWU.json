{"Reviews": [{"Title": "\"The lens\" for Pentaxian", "Author": "LFLee", "ReviewID": "R21HKKWI4L2Y0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is 'The lens' that every Pentaxian (well, this is what Pentax user called themselves) wants. It is a 'legendary' lens in the Pentax lens line up. Currently, Pentax have 3 FA limited lens: 31mm, 43mm, and 77mm. Their odd focal length number is also unique and add a sense of special to these 3 lenses. Pentax also have DA series limited for crop-sensor/APS-C cameras (current Pentax dSLR are all APS-C camera except, of course the medium format 645D). The FA limited fit full-frame digital camera, and of course can be use in crop-sensor camera as well. The 3 FA limited lenses are long been crowned as 'the three princess' in Asia, and ordered them according to the date they were introduced, the 43mm is the 'eldest princess', and the 31mm is the 'youngest princess'. More recently, (In US) some less-poetic folks called these three 'The three Amigos', which I think, doesn't fit bill to describe the size and beauty of these lenses (FA* lenses might be more suitable for 'Amigos').There are various versions of this lens. 1. Silver/Black color; 2. Japan/Vietnam made; 3. Brown/Black leather color lens pouch. Nowadays new FA ltd lens are all Vietnam made, come in Black leather lens pouch, either Silver/Black lens color. There are discussion among Pentax user that the older 'made in Japan' version is better (You can find the discussion and clarification from Ned Bunnell's blog, president of Pentax USA, though he concluded that there is no difference). They usually also command higher price in the 2nd hand market. I think it is personal preference. The old FA ltd that also come with brown lens pouch is more difficult to find (they are like the very first batch produced). A rare version of these 3 lenses come with different color lens pouches to match them as well! The 31 Limited came with a red pouch originally. The 43 with a brown one and the 77 with a green pouch (+silver color lenses), very hard to find. These 3 lenses, has achieved a 'cult' status among Pentaxian. You often hear high praises from Pentax users about them. Often, once you own one of them, you would like to collect all three of them eventually. The 31mm ltd is also the only FA ltd not design by Jun Hirakawa (the 77mm and 43mm is). The older versions of these 3 lenses are more expensive. Side note: The FA43mm ltd, however, is the only Pentax lens that was made to a Leica compatible mount (Pentax-L 43mm ltd).Rumor has it that Jun design the 31mm ltd trying to make it having the same size as 43 and 77 before it, but could only make it a f2.8 lens (due to size constraint). Pentax then change the design team, and resulted in this current large lens (compare to 43 & 77) with f1.8. Because of this (compromising in size to get larger f-stop), we now have a amazing lens. But the 31mm is the largest limited, the DA limited after it all has more compact size but with higher f-stop (slower). Guess 'compactness' is the direction of Pentax limited lens series design goal (sacrificing some f-stop) after the 31mm. I guess this is also why the new 100mm WR macro is not given a 'limited' status even though it also have a limited-like metal finished body - because of its size. whereas all DA ltd series lens are not as fast as FA ltd series lens.The price of this lens is around usd1200 everywhere. Some would say it is not worth the price. It probably is, as Pentax produced many great prime/limited lenses over the years at a lower price tag. But its built (all metal), it's sharpness at f1.8, it's special rendering (color and bokeh) and its cult status command such price. If you hold one of these lens, you know they are special. In term of price, 31mm > 77mm > 43mm (31mm price = 77mm + 43mm price). For comparable focal length lens, there is a FA 35mm f2, DA35 ltd macro f2.8, DA 35mm f2.4, FA 28mm, for 31mm ltd. There is DA 40mm ltd for 43mm ltd. There is DA70mm ltd for 77mm. The DA version is more compact than the FA version. But Pentaxian will tell you that the FA and DA ltd render the picture differently. They said the FA ltd give 'pixie dust' that DA ltd can't compare. Others say DA ltd are better because they are design/optimize for current digital camera. DA limited is also not that 'fast' (higher f-stop) compare to FA limited.The 31mm ltd is the most expensive one among the 3 FA limited. It is also the most heavy, and largest one (58mm filter size) - note 'heavy' and 'large' are relative to other Pentax FA/DA limited prime. But attached to camera, it make the camera-lens combo well-balance. Size-wise, 31mm > 77mm > 43mm.Pentax also gave the three limited lenses a unique lens hood style, which is a very nice touch. 31mm lens hood is fixed on the lens body, you can't remove it, or turn it at all. 43mm ltd has a screw-on metal lens hood, while 77mm has a slide-in lens hood that is integral part of the lens. This is just another nice touch that Pentax has put in these 3 FA limited. They each have a unique characters.If you are into Pentax system, eventually you will know about this lens. It is, of course not for everyone because of its price. But if one was to call him/herself a Pentaxian, this is one of the lens he got to own. They are not only lenses but a piece of beautiful engineering work. Its like the 'One Ring' in Lord of the Ring that rules all other rings, this is the lens that rule all other Pentax limited lens... and when you hold one, it become your 'precious'. :)If you want to start collect all three of the FA limited, I (as my friend suggested me) would suggest you to start with 77mm, 43mm, and finally 31mm. But if you come across a 31mm with a good price, just grab it. Yes, you might get cheaper fast lens in similar focal length as these 3 ltd (either from Pentax or 3rd party), but these 3 will render the picture different and unique in its own way.Hope I provided some background and history in these lens for those who wanted to own them.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great but not as good as reviews lead me to believe", "Author": "Matt Hollingsworth", "ReviewID": "R16U2P018YJ16A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My main hobby is photography. I have a pretty large collection of Pentax lenses, including the following which are of similar focal length: 35mm f3.5 Takumar, 31mm Limited FA (this review), 35mm DA Limited Macro, 40mm DA Limited (sold this one a few months ago), 50mm f1.2 SMCA, 50mm f4 Takumar Macro, 50mm f1.4 Takumar early 8 element, 50mm f1.8 Helios in K-Mount. So here's the deal - the best constructed lenses are the old Takumars. They are the smallest and best made. They 50's also have the best photo \"look\" which is hard to describe but they also have the most flare which is sometimes good and sometimes bad. Across all the lenses, the ones with the most lens elements have the least contrast/richness of color and the ones with the least elements have the most. In order from least elements to most: 50mm f4.0 Tak Macro (4), 35mm f3.5 Tak (5), 40mm DA (5), 50mm f4 Takumar Macro (5), 31mm f1.8 Limited (6), 50mm f1.8 Helios (6), 50mm f1.2 SMCA (7), 35mm f2.8 Macro Limited (8 or 9). So for low contrast subjects the 31mm lens is great. But for direct sunlight, it tends to have washed out highlights and dark dark shadows. You can photo edit it later, but getting the original balanced has worked better for me. In direct sunlight, the 35mm f2.8 Macro is superior. Neither is better all around than the other, they are just different tools. The sharpness of the lenses is similar from f2.8 up. I like the slightly wider angle of field of the 31mm for street shooting, but it is also a less portable and more intimidating lens to the subjects. The wider available aperture of the 31mm @ 1.8 is great to have. The sharpest low light lens is the original 50mm f1.4 Takumar 8 element lens. And the 50mm 1.4 Tak has the most impressionistic bokeh of any lens I own, followed closely by the Helios. The 50mm f1.2 has the smoothest bokeh of all, but is less impressionistic. I also find that the 50mm f1.2 taking pictures at f1.4 has less depth of field than the 50mm Tak at f1.4. It should be noted that the Tak's, 50mm f1.2 and Helios don't have autofocus, which can be a big deal for street photos but is not relevant at all for critical wide open shots because you will want to use Live View to focus manually in many of those scenarios anyway. So the net/net of this is that it probably doesn't matter much which of these you buy. If pressed, I'd have to say that the 35mm Macro Limited is the one I'd prefer in more cases since the lower contrast seems to turn out better in many of my daytime shots (less blown highlights/dark shadows during middle of day). And the 35mm Macro Limited is cheaper, smaller, and is capable of amazing close up shots. If you are mostly interested in close up shots, go with the 50mm f4 Takumar from the 1970's. It's even sharper and the contrast from the fewer elements produces amazing flower and insect shots (and you can get one for $100).

Razor sharp even wide open, with silky bokeh and beautifully rendered color transitions. There is a luminosity to images that I have never seen with any other lens. The all-metal build makes this lens a joy to have in the hand, and the slightly damped focus ring makes it a terrific manual focus lens. One finger is all that is needed to focus manually, making it feel more like a rangefinder lens than an SLR lens.

Waldron", "ReviewID": "R37JPVE34CUFTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the FA 31 limited for about a year, now.  I went through a number of lenses in that focal length along the way.  I shot for a long time with the Pentax DA 35mm f2.8 Macro Lens for Pentax K Mount Camera].  I really liked it, but it wasn't fast enough for low light situations.  So, I sold it and bought a [[ASIN:B000FG6CME Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras.  Finally, I decided to buy the lens I had really wanted to have the whole time and got the FA 31.To begin with, the FA 31 has a really nice build.  Very sturdy, metal construction.  As far as size goes, I would classify it as relatively small.  Bigger than most of the DA limiteds, but smaller than most zooms, even the kit lens.  The built-in hood is pretty much a waste of space.  It probably does something on a full frame camera, but on APS-C it just makes filters harder to get on and off and does little to eliminate lens flare.With regard to image quality, it is excellent.  Moderately sharp wide open, it achieves excellent sharpness by f2.  It is quite resistant to flare, has good colors.  Manual focusing is very smooth, although it lacks quick shift focusing ability that the DA line of lenses has.  Rendering of out of focus areas is excellent.  The reason that I sold my Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens was because it had a tendency to render the out of focus portion of scenes quite harshly and its edge sharpness could be quite dismal.  The FA 31 is better in both respects.The biggest problem with the FA 31 limited is that it is expensive.  If it was 100 or 150 dollars less, I would feel better about recommending it.  Still, it is just what I want and I will not be parting with my copy for anything.  If you don't need the faster aperture than the Pentax 21987 DA 35mm f/2.4 AL Lens for Pentax Digital SLR cameras is a reasonable option -- quite sharp, but with not quite as nice rendering and distinctly worse build.  If portraiture is what you are after and you don't care about edge sharpness than the Sigma 30mm f1.4 would be a reasonable option as well.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Needless to say....This is a LEGENDARY lens", "Author": "TOKUSHI \"TOKUSHI\"", "ReviewID": "R3O2YF3CAL7JIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This lens gets perfect 10 forDesignBuild quality (smooth metal body)SharpnessCreamy bokehWhat more can you ask for?If you are a Pentaxian, you owe it to yourself.Just buy it and you will find yourself smiling every time you pick up your camera.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't say enough about this lens.", "Author": "J.

(Mainly because of the high cost of admission!).  Really tough, parting with just under a grand for a 47mm f1.8 lens.  Bought the FA 43 a few months ago.  Phenomenal lens.  Gorgeous colors with silky smooth transitions, just a joy.  BUT, not quite wide enough...I'm a portrait shooter.  I won't be selling it, but still needed something wider..  Had an FA 50.  Great lens for the money, IQ not quite what I'd hoped for, and again...not wide enough.  DA*55--glowing reviews, but even more narrow.  Let me save you some time.  Buy the FA 31.  An absolute dream of a lens.  Sharp wide open, the best bokeh you'll ever see, fast, dreamy rendering.  It'll take almost everything you shoot to the next level.  That said, it will also require you to be a better shooter.  I can't put what I just stated into a succinct summary, except you will often notice what \"could have been done better\" than if you were shooting another lens.  This is THE best natural perspective lens Pentax makes, bar none.  I love it, and should have made the dive a while back.
