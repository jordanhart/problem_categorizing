{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only 3 Days In", "Author": "Lee Hodges \"Kahi\"", "ReviewID": "R2JSE3FDICU1UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "But I absolutely love this camera so far, and the other review is way off base. Firstly, of course it's going to take awhile to upload to Picasa, you are uploading pictures that are 3mb a piece, it takes just as long on my PC when uploading at full quality as it does on the camera at full quality (timed)Picture quality is great, saw a helicopter while walking to my car, zoomed in, and took a picture, WOW, if you download the full resolution version you could totally say the dudes name if you knew him. [...]Picture locking: It took me 3 minutes to figure out how to password protect pictures, when viewing pictures one of the option is a lock, you press that, and then you can password protect that picture. You can also password protect complete folders.Services: Right now it offers Youtube, Picasa, Shutterfly, Daily Motion, and Photobucket. It is only missing facebook and flickr, hopefully both will be added soon as Sony has stated they are working on bringing more services over. Kind of disappointed that it is missing flickr right now, rumor is the second week of February it will be added *fingers crossed*Value: You can definitely get a comparable camera (minus wi-fi) for a little cheaper ($140 cheaper at the time of writing this for a comparable cybershot). But come on, you are buying this camera for the cool factor; It was totally worth every penny to me to have the latest and greatest in the world of small compact cameras. The main reason I bought this camera was for Wrestlemania this year, as I do not have a camera. You can follow me on Picasa with that link earlier, and on flickr (ikahi) and on twitter [...] to see more pictures I take with the camera.Sorry for the non-sense review, wrote quick.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Better camera's out there", "Author": "Kenny Nipp \"Comicus\"", "ReviewID": "R1R10ZOU9BJT16", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought this camera's 'Wifi' would connect to my network pc's. Nope. All it does is allow the camera to connect to preloaded websites. Such as photobucket, ect... So to get my photos wirelessly to my pc I have to first upload the photos to a website, and then access the website with my pc and then download the same shots. Lame. Very badly thought out product by Sony.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "leonidas", "ReviewID": "R1J919PAIRZRIA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this because I am a sucker for cool-looking things.Wirelessly connects only with DLNA compatiple products, and is slow to upload to the internet.Very heavy.Pictures suck (a lot). Basically can only rely on it to take decent pictures in bright natural light.There are other cameras that cheaper, take better pictures, and whose battery life lasts much more. Canon PowerShot SD1400IS is just one example that comes to mind.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wifi?", "Author": "Abdus Salam Atif", "ReviewID": "RODQTZ1FPQCFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A good handy point and shot camera, just a but heavy compared to its size. Photo quality is also very good based on the form factor.Everything was fine except that battery charger got burnt after putting it in for about 5 minutes, still wondering why it happened.The Wifi speed seems very slow, I could upload the same photo with my phone a lot quicker.", "Date": "November 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Best Ever", "Author": "Paul M.
