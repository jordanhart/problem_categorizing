The paper drill whole guide is wrong in that the suggested holes are in the wrong place.  They indicate that the holes should be drilled in the 'open' position, when they should actually be drilled in the 'closed' position otherwise the lens does not look straight ahead.Don't insert the batteries either, real dome cameras do not have flashing red lights.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look real!", "Author": "Patrick Egan", "ReviewID": "R2PNSW7J5572I7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would not install the battery, as I've never seen a real camera blinking... Otherwise a good value!

They are very well made, and sturdy.The mounting is simple, and as others suggest, leave out any flashing for realism.I chose the varying colors (a real plus IMO) so they'll blend into the places I mounted them - you have one of each color.Great product and thoughtful pairing of colors.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$29.99", "Features": "Realistic Light Effect of Infrared LEDs (Battery Required)\n3-Axis Bracket for Flexible Installation", "Name": "Q-See QSM30D2PK Dome Decoy Cameras 2 Pack", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417NfIBQerL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00470GWCE"}}
