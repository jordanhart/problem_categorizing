All of the pictures have turned out great and at high quality. The battery has been better then expected, 300+ pics have been taken and it is just now at half battery life. I expected the extra stuff in the package to be cheap like in other packages, but it was not. The bag seems like it will last and has all the pockets for everything I will need to carry. I looked around for a while and this seemed to be the best deal for the price and what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$789.00", "Features": "18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II lens\n55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED lens\n14.2 MP CMOS sensor\nFull 1080p HD Cinematic Video with full-time autofocus and sound\nBuilt-in pop-up flash and In-Camera Editing", "Name": "Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Double-Zoom Lens Kit with 18-55mm and 55-200mm DX Zoom Lenses Bundle with 32GB SD Card + Multi-Card Reader + Tiffen 52mm UV Protection Filter + Tiffen 52mm Circular Polarizing Lens + SLR Camera Gadget Bag + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RWzkv6maL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E3FWSIK"}}
