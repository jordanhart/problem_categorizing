It is awesome. Not only the quality of the pics are far better than with a small camera, but also is a very versatile machine, it allows us to explor photography more fully.  We love this camera.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "My Advice", "Author": "GaPeach", "ReviewID": "R3A8GBDTH2XG7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D60 works well, is small, lightweight, and compact, and user friendly. It is a good camera. However, there is NOT much difference between the D40 and D60 other than megapixels and price. To be honest, 6 megapixels are plenty enough to make a 16X20 print. In fact, the D60 is less sensitive to light and has a slower shutter speed, creating a higher chance for blurry pictures. The glass (lense) is what's most important, not the body. So my advice--forego the overpriced D60, save yourself $300 with the D40 and buy a super good external (bounceable) flash or put towards a better lense. This is what I wish I WOULD have done.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good!", "Author": "Jackie Treehorn", "ReviewID": "R1W98AVEID5A99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for work (I'm a reporter) and it has been a pleasure to use.

Meanwhile Canon is riddled with buttons. So the end result is the D60 is a really tedious camera to use that only supports the newer, expensive AF-S lenses. And that goes for all Nikon Budget models: D40/x, D3000, D3100, D5000.Buying this camera without an AF-S kit lens would be a big mistake, but not as big a mistake as buying a budget Nikon to begin with. Unless you have no intention of using anything but the kit lens and auto modes. But the whole point of an SLR is you can change lenses and have full control, if you want it. But this camera defeats that purpose. So why buy it then?If you want an expensive point and shoot, have no plans of changing lenses, you could still go for a Canon which has buttons for everything.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Special black-gold edition D60; compact, comfortable, ergonomic design\nSuperior image quality thanks to 10.2 megapixels and Nikon's exclusive EXPEED concept; body only, lenses sold separately\nNikon Integrated Dust Reduction System includes original Airflow Control System and Image Sensor Cleaning for protection against dust\nActive D-Lighting automatically compensates highlighted or shadowy areas while you shoot, creating images with natural contrast - even in difficult lighting\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera Black Gold Special Edition (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Jlk%2BH4a1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001TH7GNM"}}
