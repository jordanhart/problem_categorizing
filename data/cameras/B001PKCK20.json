{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT for the price", "Author": "R Lucas \"R Lucas AZ\"", "ReviewID": "R1BQA9LRT6ITI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My main concerns when purchasing this camera a few months ago were whether or not it would get good, stable images of my fast moving toddler (it does,) whether the pictures would be nice looking (they are-vivid life-like colors,) and whether it would hold up well for a few years of family use (the jury is still out on that one.) I am pleased that the between shot delay is minimal and that it was very easy to \"get the hang of.\" I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a decent point and shoot option for daily family life.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "compact and stylish camera body\n2.7-inch LCD display\nExtended light sensitivity as high as ISO 1600\n14 different scene modes and three movie modes", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix L19 Digital Camera (Bright Magenta)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M6tbgGLTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001PKCK20"}}
