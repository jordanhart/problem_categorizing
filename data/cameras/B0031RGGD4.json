A 3 megapixel is good for an 8x10 for the average snap-and-shooter. What makes a good camera is good software and a good lens. This camera has a 5x Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon optical zoom lens. This company has been making lenses for a long time and know what they are doing. A nice big 3\" view finder makes it really easy to see what you're getting. All this for less than $100. This is a great camera for archiving your memories. The only thing I would do is change from 14mp to 3-6mp. The files will take up a lot less room and like I said at the beginning, for the average point-and-shooter you don't need more than 3.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Price and functions!", "Author": "EDUARDO E SCHROEDER FDEZ", "ReviewID": "RBHKZ7I8GQ1SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent price for the options you get, a similar camare from other brand at least 50% higher price.

His cousin has one and he was impressed with hers.  He loves it and has had no trouble using it. I gave it 4 stars since I have not used it and he lives out of state. He would have given it 5 stars I am sure. My experience with many items I have purchased through Amazon has been very good and I give Amazon 5 stars.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14-megapixel resolution for stunning prints up to 30 x 40 inches\n5x optical zoom; 28 mm wide-angle lens\n3-inch LCD with KODAK Color Science Technology\nKodak's Smart Capture feature\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare M575 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Forest Green)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N0wBR6FPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031RGGD4"}}
