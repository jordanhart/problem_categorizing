{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Much better than anticipated", "Author": "J. Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R1RJC0A1O76Q5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not enjoying the hunt for a consistently well-reviewed digital camera.  It seemed like every camera had an upside, and every camera had a downside.Fortunately, this camera was well-reviewed and within my price range.  I wasn't expecting much at first, but when I took it out of the box and started tinkering with it, I was pleasantly surprised.The camera is very user friendly, and I had few \"What did I just do and how do I undo it?\" moments.  The menus are self-explanatory, and easily maneuvered.One of the best aspects to this camera is that I have never really had a problem getting pictures to turn out.  There are multiple white balance settings along with multiple flash settings so that if a picture happens to come out too bright or too dim, a few button pushes and it is easily resolved.The face-finder feature is a great one, although I have done few portrait photos.  Why?  The macro setting (for extreme close-ups) proves to be an irresistable one.  Ever wanted to take one of those art-gallery-type photos of flowers or bugs?  This camera makes it so freaking easy!There are a few downsides:  Ocassionally, the photos come out rather blurry, even when I am doing my best to hold perfectly still.  This is especially true when using the macro setting and a pretty good wind is jostling your bush/flower/tree/etc...Additionally, the flash can take longer to recharge than one would probably desire, and this delay has cost me a few good pictures, but not many...Another flash issue is with the sports mode settings.  These settings are great and are for use in well-lit sporting situations.  Having said that, in those moments when you need fast, multiple shots that are NOT well-lit, I'm afraid you're just S.O.L.I don't really have any other gripes.  The batteries usually last a fairly long time.  I use crappy rechargables and have had no need to frequently change them, especially after changing the battery-type setting (yes, there's a battery-type setting!!!).  I was also impressed at the number of bonuses I found in the box with the camera: a pair of batteries, a USB cable to connect the camera to my computer (easily), photo editing software with a really cool panorama maker (you can make 360-degree panoramas, too!), and loads of useful information re: digital camera use (if you want to take the time to educate yourself).All in all, I am very pleased with this camera and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for a decent yet inexpensive digicam.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSIVE CAMERA", "Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "R3CDSBMR2YWJPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this digital camera to replace an older Kodak model and I am very impressed with the ease of use and the picture quality of this Nikon. To show how technology has so rapidly improved, my Kodak, which was purchased several years ago for $500, had 1 megapixel and took great pics. This camera is 4 megapixels, takes video as well as still shots, and has a host of other features that my Kodak did not have, and I paid $150 for it. Plus, the smaller size of the Nikon, as compared with the Kodak, makes it easier to carry along. I purchased a 1GB memory card to store a lot of pictures. The internal memory of the camera, without the card, can hold about 10 pics. The viewing screen also improves the ability to take pictures more easily than looking through a small viewfinder. I was very pleased with the movie mode, which takes crystal clear videos. There is no audio with the movie feature, but I save important videos for my video camera. This is a great feature to have, nonetheless, for those moments where you might want to capture some video footage. Then only drawback to this camera, which is very minor, is that it does not come with an AC adaptor, which I would want to use when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, so as to save the batteries. I ordered the adaptor from a camera shop separately, which runs about $30. All in all, this a great camera, easy to use, takes impressive pictures and is a lot of fun.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Compact Point-and-Shoot", "Author": "Marie Wells \"bouviermom\"", "ReviewID": "RIHRZZJZT39V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I, too, bought this camera as a replacement for a previous digital camera.  My Olympus D-450 was flawless - at only 1.3 megapixels, the quality of the photos (even 8x10 enlargements) was superb and it was extremely easy to use.  However, there was the issue of those mini-megapixels, the camera's age (7 years) and size (it was getting too big to schelp around handily).  So I talked myself into stepping up into the 21st century of digital cameras.I've had this little Nikon for 15 hours and there's nothing I don't know how to do on it at this point, it's that easy to set up and use.  Photo quality is wonderful.  I have a couple of 256mb memory cards on order and will likely run out and get yet another, bigger, card today.  I take lots of pictures, and with a major vacation coming up in 6 weeks, I'll be taking lots and lots more pictures.  A big selling point for me was the slightly larger viewing screen (2\").  1.5 inches in some of the compact digital cameras is just TOO small.FYI, for those of you who quibble about downloading pictures from the camera (any camera) to your computer, get yourselves a memory card reader.  Not only does it save your batteries, the download speed will astonish you.  I have a SanDisk ImageMate 12; that means it reads 12 different types of cards/memory sticks.  It runs off the USB port in your computer, so there are no batteries involved.  It's inexpensive and well worth it.To sum up, this little Nikon is easy to use, produces great photos and I look forward to many years of faithful service - I hope! - from it.  And the price! - 1/3 of what I paid for the old Olympus for many more features. This one is a winner in my book.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A good value in a camera for almost everyone", "Author": "Michael J. Edelman", "ReviewID": "R2B4CKZ2N3QXGR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the L4 as a gift for my young photobug nephew nephews to replace an older camera I'd bought for him a few years ago. He's delighted with it, and why not? It has excellent resolution (4MP), good color, Nikon quality, good battery life and easy to navigate menus. It uses AA cells, which means batteries are always available. As for me, I was happy with the excellent value for the price.With 4MP resolution, this camera can easily produce images that can be blown up to 8x10 or 11x14- more than enough to satisfy 99% of the camera buyers out there. If you never blow up pictures beyond 4x6 or 5x7, you could pay two or three times as much and still not get better images. For web use, it's more than sufficient; you could crop away 80% of an image and still have more than enough resolution for a page-sized web image. Builders and others needing to document work will find it a useful accesory that can be kept at hand in a small belt pack.About the only thing this camera doesn't have is instant shutter response, something that you still need to pay about $400 or so to get. But for general purpose family use, for kids learning photography, and even for the artist on a budget it's an excellent choice.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sweet!", "Author": "R. M.

I was looking for a good camera to take a few photographs of my child, and my cousin who is a South Asian dealer for various kinds of cameras and equipment recommended the Nikon L series to me.  The L3 and the L2 seemed to be somewhat above budget for a student, so I tried the L4 and was pleasantly surprised.The icons and buttons are very user friendly. The camera takes plain AA batteries which proved to be very useful on a visit to Sixflags when the existing batteries died mid-trip.The photographs come out slightly blurry in inadequate lighting which I first thought was a fault of the camera.  I compared this with a friend who owns a Sony cybershot 7.2 MP camera, and his does the same in uneven light.  The photographs are superb in daytime and in the evening/night there are a few settings to choose from.The size is unobtrusive, and fits inside a pants pocket easily. The LCD is very well lit and user-friendly.Some people may consider it a downside that the camera does not have a viewfinding lens; I did not consider it to be a problem.I higly recommmend this camera to someone starting out as a photographer.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "J.

It defines point-and-shoot and does what it's supposed to without fuss. It has a perfectly adaquate zoom, a bright screen and runs a surprisingly long time on a set of batteries. It's small and pocketable so it goes anywhere. Only negative is that you need to go out and buy a case (Nikon makes a nice one and there are plenty of others.)This camera takes double AA betteries which is a big plus. You can get an inexpensive charger and batteries (Radio Shack, all the big-box stores, etc) and those are fine for most uses. However, in a pinch, normal Duracell/Energizer AAs work just fine. That means you'll never run out of juice, even when traveling.This camera is a gem - don't hesitate, go for it.

No matter how many megapixels camera you order, keep in mind that you will have to edit the size in order to email them to people. So, the mega, megapixel cameras appear to appeal to those people who will actually print the pics or view them on their TV's.

Nikon makes some of the best cameras on the market and this, for the price, is one of them. It is only 4.0 megapixels but don't let that fool you. The camera is perfect size, not too small not too big. It takes beautiful pictures! The best part about this camera is that you can set it on scene mode and customize the picture to what you are taking a picture of!! For example, if you are taking a close up of someones face, you set it on portrait and then it gives you an outline on the LCD screen to line up their face with to make sure you get a great shot everytime! It has tons of settings including nightshot, sports mode, scenic mode, fireworks mode, indoor/party mode, and on and on. It also captures video which is amazing. I set it on sunset mode once and took a beautiful clear snapshot of the sun setting. The software that comes with it is so easy to use. It uses Picture Project to upload your pics and you can edit, make picture projects and slideshows of your pictures on there as well. It takes clean pictures in color, black and white, and sepia. It only has 16mb of internal memory so you do need to get an extra memory card. I have a 128mb card in mine and I have taken 100 pictures so far and still have more to go. There are so many neat features on this camera. I bought mine at walmart for under $125 which is very reasonable. The only problem with this camera is that if you use it a lot, the battery life isn't very long, but I think that most digital cameras are the same way. So keep a couple of extra AA batteries handy (preferably rechargables.)The camera also comes with a cord to connect it to your TV to view the pictures.

Small, simple, and almost goof-proof, this is an ideal inexpensive camera for anyone just getting started. No optical viewfinder, managable file sizes, and the typical unbeatable Nikon lens mean you get serious bang for your buck with this camera. Full auto works well, and easy access to simple manual control over the basic parameters of the capture process mean it is easy for anyone to make minor adjustments. Also, there are (I think) 16 or 20 custom auto modes, including fireworks, black & white, etc.HUGE plus: this camera runs on AA batteries. Spend about $25 once on a charger and two sets of high-capacity rechargables (2600miAh), and you will be all set. Regular Energizers are good for 100+ shots with the flash. The rechargables I bought are good for easily 250+ on a charge.

The only downsides really is the time it takes from when you take a picture to the time you can take the next, it takes a second for the flash to charge. The camera only comes with 10mb internal memory, so unless you are going to invest in a bigger memory card, you will only be able to take about 6 pictures.

Raiz", "ReviewID": "R1FWGB53VDZDX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.  I was drawn to this model from the Nikon reputation for making first rate 35mm cameras.  I didn't realize that even their simplest digital point and shoot cameras could be so good.  The most important thing to look for in a camera is a quality lens, and Nikon makes the best.The camera has three modes of operation:  fully automatic, scenes, where you can choose from among 15 scenes, control the flash, and use other features, and video. Video is the least useful feature, since it is without sound.  I took a couple of videos in sunlight, and in one could see streaks on the bottom.  The other one was fine, but in either you don't get the quality from single snap shots.The build is light, so you need to be extra careful when handling it. I attached the wrist strap and looped it around my wrist when taking pictures, and when I'm in between pictures the camera goes right back into the case.Nikon had to make some comprises, so here is what you don't get:  a viewfinder (wouldn't use it, anyhow); video with sound; quick turnaround from taking the first picture to the second.  It takes it a few seconds for the camera to store the shot and allow you to take another one.  But unless you are professional who must take fast action shots at a sporting event, the performance is more than sufficient. One thing worth noting is that you can set it to a mode where it takes up to ten shots when you press the shutter, and keeps the best one of the bunch; you never see the others.  I don't have the steadiest hand, and it still managed to take very in focus and sharp pictures.  It is recommended to use lithium or rechargeable batteries, or you will be finding yourself replacing the batteries after 100 or so pictures.  But this is typical of most digital cameras.My camera only cost $25.00, and that was a steal.  It is a few years old and not state of the art, but from my research on digital cameras you don't need much more than 4 or 5 mega pixels to get very good pictures, unless you plan on enlarging your pictures larger than 8 x 10.I shared my initial pictures with my daughter, who owns a much more expensive and state of the art Cannon, and she couldn't believe that such an inexpensive camera was used.
