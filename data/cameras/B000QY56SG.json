Schneider \"old movie buff\"", "ReviewID": "R15PFR0BY8KZX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera, certainly more than worth the money. Of all the digitals I've owned, this is by far the easiest to use. Most digital cameras, when you press the shutter button halfway and then fully, seem to pause to think about taking the picture. By then the shot is lost. This is as close to a point-and-shoot as you can get. The software leaves a bit to be desired. I find it easier to download using the software left over from a Canon Elph I no longer use. But the camera itself is wonderful. Advice: order a bag, too. The large LED screen can easily be damaged.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Loved the Camera for almost a year.", "Author": "Patrica Morris", "ReviewID": "RTQMROU7UHM8G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on May 6,2007 and absolutly loved it. It was the best camera I had ever bought. Yesterday 4/9/08 I fell out of love with said camera when it refused to power on. I tried 2 different batteries, I tried to power on with just the dock and nothing notta dead. I contacted HP they had me reset the memory thinking this would do the trick and notta still dead. HP had me go through some other things and all atempts were null. So HP gives me the details in order to send the said camera in on warranty. When I sent them the information that they require they then told me said information was not good enough and I would have to send more. I paid full retail for this camera as I bought it close to when it was first released and now it is dead and HP is giving me a runaround. So beware I loved this camera too but it only lasted a year.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hard Worker", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R1JKBAA57SD0J2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VERY HAPPY - Bought 3 years ago.  Very hard working camera.  Large display - point & shoot.  I find the bad reviews a bit harsh... for example.  Yes the power on slide switch is easy to bump when in a pocket.  As it powers up it makes a distinct electronic sound that warns you it has powered on! The 2 things I differ with are 1- it will power itself off in about 3 minutes unless you are bumping it on and off and on again repeatedly. 2- I have never taken it out of my pocket stone dead.  My 2008 version has been a great companion.  Original battery still works if kept charged as instructed.  I take photos in automotive shops and body shops (dirty environment) as well as family outings.  I think it is well worth the money.  If you want perfection, go spend $1500 - $3000.  They work a bit better, and have more goof proof innovations.  For my $$$...this puppy is a wonderful piece of equipment for the money.  Buying another one for a grandchild today!

Erickson", "ReviewID": "R2OSEH4C4L1QSE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my HP Photosmart R847 8MP digital camera for my birthday in May 2008. First the praise: R847 is indeed simple to use, and it's light, small and slim - a good pocket size, BUT...(see Disappointments). If you manage to find perfect focus on its \"best\" setting, this camera produces absolutely gorgeous images - you can zoom in and in and in (during edit, that is) and the details just get richer and yummier (in the blow-up in front of me I can count my kitten's eyelashes - beautiful!). Now the disappointment: this camera has ZERO battery life, since its first full charge and use - I am able to take and review 40 photos MAX on a full charge before it is depleted.  I called HP about this the first week after I received the camera, and I was basically told \"gee, tough luck\" - but that they'd be delighted to sell me another battery, 50 dollars please. (VERY poor customer service experience.)  R847 doesn't like to find focus on small objects. I particularly like spiders and bumblebees, but focus is very hit and miss, and usually several inches behind the object you want to capture. I just can't figure out the \"sweet spot\" - it seems pretty random. A tiny change in angle, lighting, etc and you lose focus again. Although, as I mentioned, this camera is a great pocket size, you can't carry it there because the stupid slide-down lens cover is SO easily flipped open. And then it sits in your pocket and GOES DEAD. Actually, that even happens in the carrying case occasionally, if you knock or bump it. This is a MAJOR design flaw. It needs a catch on the cover to prevent the accidental nudge-open. I love the image quality, but half the time I can't even take photos because R847 is stone dead. I would not buy another camera of this design, and I would not recommend it for others to purchase.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very easy to use", "Author": "Driver \"driver222\"", "ReviewID": "RZPM4UE0EITB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is NOT our first Digital Camera!

Don't buy it unless you want all of your memories to look like they took place inside of a funhouse.  I don't know what HP did with the lenses, but if you take a photo of a square object, the sides of it appear to \"bend\" or \"bow\" outward.  It's sad because other than this one major flaw, this is an awesome and easy-to-use camera.  The large and bright display is very impressive too.  What a shame!  It's back in the box, and will be returned today.
