{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon 70D First Impressions", "Author": "S. Burg", "ReviewID": "R3HGVPZ5IEWOI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is going to be short, since I've not had the chance to do a whole lot of shooting as yet. Consider it a \"just out of the box\" impression. I already have a Canon 5D Mk III, and a number of L series lenses. I wanted a \"backup camera\" for video shooting, and I was intrigued by the new auto-focus system offered on the 70D.So far, I'm extremely pleased with this camera. The 18-35 mm kit lens gives a lot of range, and I tested the camera out with my other lenses. The L series lenses work very well, and auto-focusing is fast, smooth, and doesn't search around much even in very low light. The camera is not as heavy as the 5D Mk III, but feels solid enough, and not all that different in the hands. Even with the 70-300mm f4-5.6L IS USM zoom - my heaviest lens at the moment - the camera feels surprisingly balanced.The crop sensor obviously changes the effect of the lenses, but having a full sensor and a crop sensor both, it's like having 2 sets of lenses. My 70-300mm zoom now has an effective reach up to 480 mm (on the Canon 70D) due to the crop factor of 1.6. To me, this is kind of a bonus, though not in itself a reason to buy the camera. Smaller sized sensors result in an apparent increase in focal length, and a greater depth of field, but this is a generalization and each lens has its own properties that affect the image as well. Read the reviews of individual lenses when considering how each one reacts to different types of camera bodies.The main thing to take note of is that while the Canon 70D will accept all the EF and EF-L lenses, it is designed to use the EF-S series lenses as well. In fact, the EF-S series lenses are custom tailored specifically for the Canon 70D and (as far as I know) other APS-C crop sensor cameras made by Canon. These lenses - and the kit lens is one of them - will not work on a full frame camera like the Canon 5D mkIII; the rear element extends back into the camera body in a way that makes it impossible to attach lenses of this series to full frame sensor cameras. Even if they could be attached, I suspect the captured image might suffer from serious vignetting and other problems.For a thorough understanding of how the APS-C, full frame and other types of sensors interact with various lenses, I highly recommend doing some research on the web. There's a lot of good information out there, and this is a fairly involved subject that I don't even want to attempt to dive into here :)One thing I couldn't figure out before having the camera in my possession deserves a mention. This is my first experience with a fold-out LCD screen on a DSLR, and I had no idea how the display would deal with flipping around 180 degrees. Would it be upside down? This was the first thing I tried, and the screen auto-flips when it is rotated. Maybe everyone else already knows this - but I didn't! Anyway, the fold-out display is a great feature, and it also folds face-in to protect the display when not in use.The ability to touch various points on the LCD display while in Live View or shooting video, and shift focus while shooting is - to me at least - worth the price of admission. If Canon eventually updates the 7D and/or the 5D Mk III, this functionality would be most welcome!Purely as a \"gut reaction\" - I really like the 70D immensely. And it seems a very good value for the price. This may actually become my preferred \"walk-around camera, though time will tell.EDIT - 10/22/2013: I've spent a lot more time with the camera now, so I can add to my earlier comments.While I purchased the 70D mainly for shooting video, I recently used it to shoot bracketed exposures for HDR (high dynamic range) panoramas. A friend of mine had a nodal camera head (The \"Ninja\" head) which allowed for precise rotation of the camera to cover a full 360 degree field-of-view. The Canon 70D allows for up to 7 bracketed exposures via the AEB controls. The plates were shot in the RAW (CR2) format, using the kit lens, and stitched together using PTGui software.After some initial trial runs, where we ironed out the kinks in the whole process, the results were exceptional. For those who may be wondering \"why do you want a 32 bit HDR 360 panorama at 10k-16k resolution?\" it is used to create realistic lighting and reflections in a 3D/CG software (i.e. Modo or Maya, for example). The 3D scene can be lit entirely by the 360 panoramic image, producing a very convincing result.At any rate, the Canon 70D delivered terrific results doing something I didn't even foresee when I bought the camera. I will try and upload some of the tests (where the photographic panorama serves as both background and light-source) if I can figure out how to do so on the Amazon site.EDIT - 11/9/2013: A note to anyone who intends to shoot green screen (for color keyed composites) or do precise color grading in post production: The video output from the 70D is not YCbCr 4:2:2 compression. This is not apparent to the naked eye when viewing the video footage, but it becomes an issue when attempting to work with the footage in a post environment. The firmware update for the Canon 5D addressed this problem by enabling 4:2:2 color output via the HDMI port to an external recording device (I use the Atomos Ninja 2 for this) but currently uncompressed \"clean\" HDMI is not enabled on the Canon 70D. I have my fingers crossed this will be dealt with in an update to the firmware.This is not a huge issue unless you intend to do extensive manipulation of your video footage in post production, but it is something to consider with this camera and DSLRs in general. There are workarounds, of course, but that can entail a fair amount of time & effort, particularly when extracting color key mattes (masks) involving fine edge detail or areas of transparency.That being said, the footage is nevertheless beautiful. And I suspect this technical point should not be an issue for most people considering buying the Canon 70D. The CR2 (camera raw) files are not at all affected by this, it's a factor limited to the HD video.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal", "Author": "Josh Webb", "ReviewID": "R23Y8VS8GR4T83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background info on my experience/use: semi pro portrait/event photographer, professional landscape photographer. Cameras past and present: canon 5D mark III, Canon 7D (owned currently), Leica M3 35mm film, Canon 60D, And Canon t3iThe nitty gritty on this camera after a week of use:Build/functionality-Its a solid update to the popular 60d dslr. Smaller profile than its predecessor however the grip and feel of the camera still remains solid.  And much more girth than its younger siblings in the Rebel series.  The redesign of button locations on the rear of the camera make for a fluid interface to the menus screens while maintaining the appeal that higher quality SLRs have had with dedicate Aperature and Shutter speed wheels.  The added perk of the New touch screen technology from the T4i and T5i have greatly improved the speed to many obscure functions sometimes needed in the depths of software.  Its actually pretty fantastic to say the least.Photo Quality-With the addition of the newer Digic 5+ processor the picture quality is only gradually enhanced from the previous Digic 4 of the older generations and 60D. What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed. 7 fps puts this camera closer to the 7D in respects of action photography.  I did have high hopes for better low light photos with a new processor since the 60D essentially used a 4 year old unit but unfortunately they look almost identical.  It seems you will need to step into a full frame like the 6d or the 5D mark ii & iii to get a substantial difference in quality above 1600 ISO that only a larger sensor can provide.Video Quality-What really sets this camera apart from the rest of the line up(except the 5D mark III) is its incredible ability to process video (and with touch screen focus!!!)  Its active autofocus tracks well with lenses.  Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.  This camera has built in stereo recording unlike the mono of the 60D.  It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording. But lets me honest, most of us who do photography and cinematography often do all of our editing from computer software outside of the camera ie lightroom/photoshop etc.  With the STM lenses its fairly quick in its focusing and extremely quiet since they were design specifically for camera bodies like the 70D, t4i, and t5i in a video application.  Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.  It is a jack of all trades.  Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.  In short.  If you need an all around camera this is it.  If you need a camera for only still photography you may be better off buying a 7D or full frame camera for the money even tho it does do a \"pretty good\" job much like the original 60D. Either way you cant lose.  I promise.********To anyone using Lightroom 4.4 or lower this camera is not compatible with the CR2 aka RAW files for editing.  If you shoot RAW you will need to buy the new Adobe Lightroom 5 and update it to the 5.2 version to even get it to view.  Anyone shooting in jpeg will be fine.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "Michael DiDomenico", "ReviewID": "R1GN5OJHZ992XQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my new CANON 70D a week ago. I have been reading every review that has come available on the Internet and also You-tube. I have also talked to a few Professionals who use CANON equipment to get their view. I will not bore you with all of my talk, but I will give you some things that I have found out since receiving my unit.AUTO FOCUSThis is a huge jump from my 60D. It has the 7D - 19 point AF and all cross point. It makes for a fast AF and cleaner photo's. I am amazed at how many more AF points lock onto a subject when using the auto focus sequence.DUAL PIXEL, LIVE VIEWI would think these go hand in hand, and they work quickly and well. The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's. Very impressive upgrade from the LIVE VIEW on my 60D.VIDEOI shot a video today while at the zoo and the clarity was excellent, so was the color saturation. Full HD is by default and it is excellent for what I will use it for when traveling. I also was not using one of the new STM lenses and when zooming in and out, there wasn't any noise on the video. I was not using an external mic.I have tried all of the scene modes and found them to be a good selection. I like the HDR mode and also the multiple photo mode, something I guess people have been interested in seeing from CANON. I have been very impressed with the camera. It is a good upgrade from the 60D, it has much more to offer and the higher PIXEL Count shows up in the photo's, as does the increased FPM. 7 FPM seems so much faster than the 5.3 of the 60D.I have already recommended this to a couple of my friends who are looking into upgrading their equipment.11-07-2013I wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge. I am not using Wi-Fi right now.3-9-2014went to the NUCLEAR COWBOYZ show and shot over 45 minutes of video and about 150 stills. Many of my video was at ISO 6400 as this was an indoor event. Outstanding quality with my 24-105mm, f/4, 'L' lens. Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed. The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good. I was amazed and the people who watched my video's in HD were surprised. Once more I know that I have a very good camera.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "A jack-of-all-trades with the best amateur video available", "Author": "D. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1KOB439K3FCKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera a lot. It's a vast upgrade from the 60D, combining the best features of that body, the T5i, 6D, and 7D, with superior movie motion tracking. It's the first DSLR I can recommend for amateur video without a caveat for slow autofocus. Shooting stills from the rear LCD still favors mirrorless and hybrid bodies, but employing the 70D's viewfinder pulls the advantage back to Canon.I've listed the history of this line so you can get a feel for where it slots.MODEL EVOLUTION:==== 50D /200815MP9-point AF, all cross-points6.3 fps, 16 raw96% viewfinder640 x 480 LCDAF micro-adjustmentAF joystickFlash sync socketCF memory cards==== 60D /2010+ 18MP+ 1080p/720p/480p movies+ Mono mic+ 720 x 480 LCD+ LCD articulates+ Metering improved+ White balance improved+ Wireless flash control+ HDR / MSNR / exposure merge+ Raw conversion and filters on-camera+ Movie crop zoom (7X, 480p)+/- SD cards+/- simplified button layout-- 5.3 fps, 16 raw-- no AF joystick-- no AF micro-adjust-- no flash sync socket-- lesser build==== 7D /2009+ 19-point AF, all cross-points+ 8 fps, 25+ raw+ AF joystick+ AF micro-adjust+ Magnesium chassis+ 100 % viewfinder+ Flash sync port+ Weather-sealing(ish)+ Video sound level adjustment+/- CF cards+/- larger-- 640 x 480 LCD-- LCD won't articulate-- Movie crop zoom-- HDR / MSNR / exposure merge==== 70D /2013+ 20 MP, noise improved+ 'Dual Pixel AF' in Live View+ LCD articulates+ LCD touchscreen+ 720 x 480 LCD+ Wifi built-in+ Silent-shooting w/ viewfinder+ Scene Intelligent Auto mode+ Stereo mics+ Video compression improved+ Movie crop zoom (3X, 1080p)+ HDR / MSNR / exposure merge+/- SD cards+/- smaller+ /- weather sealing+/- simplified button layout-- 7 fps, 16-23 raw-- no AF joystick-- no spot-AF or AF-point expansion-- no flash sync port-- lesser buildViewed from another angle, here's where we've seen the major features before:* 20MP sensor* Dual-Pixel AF* 16-shot raw buffer, 60-shot jpeg buffer (60D)* 19-point AF system (7D)* Swivel LCD screen (60D)* Touchscreen LCD (T5i)* Simplified rear control layout (6D)* Wifi (6D)* AF micro-adjustment (7D)* Stereo microphones (T5i)* Silent shooting through the viewfinder (5D III)* Movie crop zoom (T3i)* IPB and ALL-I video compression (5D III)* On-camera raw conversion, movie editing, and effects preview (T5i)* Scene Intelligent Auto mode (T5i)It's like a greatest-hits album; there's almost nothing from the parts bin that hasn't made an appearance.HANDLING AND NEW FEATURES:No surprise: it feels like a 60D. Small compared to the 40D/50D/7D, but without the handling compromises you'd see moving to a T5i. General build is fine except for the mushy buttons. It isn't brickish like the 7D and the other two to a lesser extent. The difference shows up on the scale: this body mirrors the 60D and weighs 6 ounces less than the 7D, splitting the difference between that and a T5i. Good for travel, though lens weight tends to dictate the DSLR experience at this level.Canon has rejiggered the button layout to match the 6D. A new button near the shutter changes AF modes. Five buttons have switched functions relative to the 60D. Menu adjustments are faster because you can use both thumbs. If you're shooting multiple bodies, the 70D pairs best with a 6D, and the 7D with the 5D III. Earlier bodies require more acclimation.Coming from the 40D/50D/7D, I'm not keen on the rear dial and D-pad. The dial works, it's just small. The D-pad, though, is at least an inch from the AF-on button. If you're using it for direct AF point selection and the AF-on button to AF, you'll wear out your thumb in a hurry. The 40D/50D/7D all have a separate hat-switch in a more ergonomic position. That aside, there's the question of weather-sealing. Regardless of what Canon says, pretend it's a sieve if you're in more than a drizzle. The 'it got wet' repair isn't cheap and the kit lenses aren't sealed.The big addition for the 70D is the touchscreen. The implementation is straight from the T5i: if you can adjust a setting with the physical UI, you can adjust it by touch. This significantly lowers the EOS learning curve. The touchscreen is capacitive and almost as responsive as a modern smartphone, unless you're wearing non-conductive gloves.How does touch change things in practice? If you're a novice, it makes things accessible. Press the Q button to pull up all the major camera functions and tap to adjust. If you're more advanced, it simplifies Live View autofocus. You don't have to place focus points on your subject or pan a focus box with the D-pad. Just tap. It's so much faster. This yields huge dividends when coupled with LCD articulation for off-angle shooting (of high or low objects), studio shooting from a tripod, and most especially with movies, where you have no time for adjustments and don't want to shake the camera by mashing buttons. Picture review also benefits. Phone gestures (e.g., pinch zoom, swiping) make checking focus vastly quicker and more flexible than on any other non-touch EOS camera.Wifi is also new. I didn't care much for it on the 6D, but it's growing on me for one reason: I can get a live feed to my phone with AF control. That's a big deal. You've always been able to remotely trigger EOS bodies with radio transmitters, but you can't preview the shot, change settings, or move the AF point. Third-party software will do all that, but only with a cable. It's always been an either-or thing. Now you can have both with a free Canon app that'll work with Android or iOS.Wireless control opens a lot of creative possibilities. Put the camera on a bear path or strap it to your car. Make it a flexible second-shooter at a wedding or behind a hockey net. Take a selfie or a group shot without prefocusing or hoping there's contrast in front of an AF point. Move pictures to the phone, process in Instagram, and upload to Flickr. Shoot in one room and have an assistant sort pictures in another on a different floor. I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface.Wireless limitations? A few. You can't take or send movies when Wifi is on (and the setting won't change automatically, you'll probably end up binding it to your custom menu), the app has only bare-bones functionality, live preview is sluggish, and a transfer rate of 2 MB/s makes it impractical to move 25 MB raw files. You wouldn't do any better with an Eye-Fi card; the X2 version is about half as fast.Because it combines a touchscreen with most of the hardware controls from Canon's professional bodies, this body leaves a lot of room to grow. It won't be intimidating for long if you're coming from a Rebel.VIEWFINDER AUTOFOCUS:Like all DSLRs that can display a live feed to the rear LCD, the 70D has multiple autofocus systems. The primary is for stills shot through the viewfinder. The other is for stills or movies composed from the rear LCD.The AF array for viewfinder shooting is a 19-point system pulled from the 7D. It covers the same area as the 9-point array from the 40/50/60D/T5i/T4i, but the hit-rate in AI-Servo (Canon's motion-tracking mode) with fast or unpredictable movement improves by at least half. That applies to the full grid and, to a lesser extent, the center point alone. The older system was already a third better than the one in the T2i/T3i/SL1. Thanks to the dense AF grid, the 70D is much less likely to miss during full-grid shooting for lack of having a point on contrast.While it's definitely an upgrade over the 60D, there are few caveats to this system relative to the 7D:First, it has only three of the 7D's five AF modes: Full Auto (19 point), Zone AF (5 zones), and Single-Point (1 point). It's missing Spot AF (1 point, reduced size) and AF Point Expansion (1 point, reverts to local outer points if necessary). Will you miss them? Maybe. Spot AF makes it easy to hit a very small target with a fast lens, like an eye instead of an eyebrow. AF Point Expansion is great for motion when you want to use a specific AF point, but with a fallback so the camera won't give up if that point misses.Zone AF isn't a perfect substitute. It groups points into areas that you can select, but the point chosen within each area is always the one over the closest subject. If your subject is surrounded by other viable closer subjects, that may cause a miss noticeable with a fast lens.Second, there's more button-pressing than with the 40D/50D/60D for single-point shooters. The earlier bodies can directly select the outer AF points (where eyes typically end up in portraits) with one thumb movement. This 70D can't because the rocker only goes 8 ways (plus a center button) for 19 points. There's no custom function to ignore middle points. Zone AF gives the same economy of thumb movement, but without the same precision from each zone.Third, certain older lenses may be more consistent with the 60D system. I've had trouble in the past with false focus confirmations on a 7D paired with a 50/1.4 and 50/1.8. Firmware updates since may have negated that issue; I don't know. The 70D hasn't hinted at it so far. Still, whatever you buy, give it a controlled bench test before you trust it in the field. Even four-digit gear has quality control variation.Three other narrow points of note: like the 7D, this body has AF microadjustment, an AF offset intended to tune out manufacturing variability in lenses and bodies. Third-party, wide-aperture, and telephoto lenses benefit most. Less so lenses with older AF mechanisms (e.g., 50/1.8, 50/1.4) and those that misfocus variably at different distances or lighting. We've also had a custom function switcheroo. The 7D had one for ignoring obstructions in AI-Servo. The 70D replaces that with one that controls sensitivity to objects that change speed erratically. The 70D also loses the 7D's ability to bind an alternate AF point or zone to a button.In aggregate though, I'm pleased with what I've seen so far. Full-grid automatic AF and AI-Servo on the 60D and before were not ideal. The focus points were too far apart, the selection method was not predictable, and AI Servo was not consistent with static subjects. As a result, I used One Shot with single-point selection for most subjects. This 70D is actually usable in full-auto. When I had a 7D, I found myself in full-auto or Zone AF with AI Servo about half the time shooting f/2.8 or above. I see no reason to change that with the 70D, so I'm not as disappointed about the loss of the other two AF modes as I could be.LIVE VIEW AUTOFOCUS:The 70D's Live View AF is a revolutionary feature, so let's start with deep background. Skip the next three paragraphs if you're already familiar.Live View focusing has always been a challenge for true DSLRs. Absent a translucent light-robbing mirror, you can't get a live feed to the rear LCD without disabling the main phase-detect AF array. In the past, that left you with focus from whatever the camera could divine from image data, the same 'contrast-detect' AF used in point-and-shoot cameras, mirrorless bodies, and phones. But unlike phase-detect, the camera doesn't know which direction or how far to focus. So it guesses. And hunts.Fine for still subjects and small sensors if it's done right. Not so much a DSLR; Canon's implementation in every body before the T4i was pretty much unusable with any moving subject. The T4i sensor had a couple of phase-detect pixels in the middle to make things less bad. The SL1 expanded that system to 65% frame coverage, which made it Canon's best hands-off movie DSLR.But the SL1 is hardly perfect even within the phase-detect AF area. It's usable with subjects that don't move toward or away from the camera too quickly (about a third as fast as the main phase-detect AF array could track), but it still gets confused, it's not brilliant in low-light, and there's a subtle back-and-forth focus-racking when it settles on a subject and when tracking anything.Enter the 70D. Canon's made every pixel over the same area capable of phase-detect with a technique they call 'Dual Pixel AF.' And they've done it without any obvious effect on image quality, while ditching contrast-detect entirely for most lenses. Apparently Canon employs wizards.What performance can you expect relative to the SL1 and the main phase-detect array?(+) In Movie Servo mode, it responds almost instantly to scene changes. Focusing on static objects in general is very quick, although a few mirrorless bodies are even faster. Enabling face detection adds a slight delay, and more if there's no face in the scene.(+) Different lenses change focus at different speeds. None of them seem to run at maximum speed. The change algorithm is tuned for pleasing transitions.(+) There's no focus-racking when focus stops. All mirrorless bodies still do this in low light and most in bright light.(+) It keeps subjects that move at one speed in focus instead of repeatedly snapping in and out of focus. Here again, some mirrorless bodies can track things even faster, but the object won't actually be in focus for as long. With the kit lenses in good light, it'll hold focus on a subject moving directly at the camera from close range at 7-10 MPH. Indoors in low light, closer to 3-5 MPH. Movement can be much faster if it's far away or tangent to the camera.(+) Focus accuracy is very high. AF-M does not, and need not, apply here.(+) USM lenses work as fast as STM, though USM may be audible on the audio track in quiet settings. STM lenses are capable of smoother transitions.(+) It works down to EV 0, half the light of the SL1 and almost even with the main array. Almost candlelight.(+) Face-tracking is effective even with conventional indoor household lighting.(+/-) It works with lenses as slow as f/11, a full stop ahead of the SL1 and two ahead of the main array. Not Canon teleconverters, however. A third-party TC that doesn't report the aperture? Maybe.(-) The main array is still more responsive with erratic movement.(-) A few lenses don't work with it. The ones that matter are: 14/2.8L MK1, 24/1.4L MK1, 16-35/2.8L MK1, 28-70/2.8L, and 80-200/2.8L.(-) Contrast-detect is the fallback for unsupported lenses, Movie Crop Zoom, and some teleconverters.It's just incredibly confident. The subject was out of focus. Now it's in focus. If you choose your own AF points, it looks like a professional focus-pull. The only difference is that you can't (as yet) control the transition pace. That may well become an update down the road, and I'm sure Canon will improve speed and predictive ability in future generations. A version of this system may eventually even obviate the main array. But for now, it's good enough. Great, even. Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good. There's about a half-stop less noise in JPEG and raw relative to the 18MP bodies and less low-frequency blotchiness at high ISOs. JPEG noise processing has improved. Colors are preserved better at high ISOs. I'd run this body to ISO 6400ish for full-res shots. The 6D is two solid stops ahead if low-light is your highest priority.Dynamic range is about the same, though you can add a stop back to the highlights with Highlight Tone Priority. I use that feature constantly in daylight; it's worth the noise to keep the whites intact. Nikon leads here with the D5200 and D7100. Those two also have slightly more detail from their 24 MP sensors, similar high-ISO noise, and less shadow noise at low ISO. Color noise in deep shadows is still there with the 70D, so you can't be quite as aggressive boosting low tones in post.That aside, a deep 16-23 frame raw buffer, 7 FPS (7.5 in raw), and the 7D's AF system make this a legitimate sports camera. It wasn't so long ago that Canon's 1D series capped out at 8 FPS. Stills shooting with Live View is a different story, though. You can still bang out frames at full speed, but you won't be able to see or track anything. The live feed doesn't come back until a few seconds after you've released the shutter button. Focus is fixed from the first frame. Better mirrorless bodies show intermediate frames and continue to focus, but that's partly out of necessity. I don't rely on Live View for scenarios that need quick feedback.MOVIES:If this is your first foray into DSLR video, you'll be impressed. The right lenses give creamy backgrounds and professional-looking subject isolation, often with the subject you actually intended. Such are the benefits of that trick AF system. But don't expect the stills-centric interface to feel quite as natural as that of a purpose-built video camera.The 70D's feature set borrows a few things from the 5D III: 1080p/30, 720p/60, 480p/30, Time Code support, and a choice of IPB and ALL-I compression. Missing are the 5D III's headphone jack, uncompressed HDMI video, live audio gain control, and both Av and Tv modes (M is still available). We might eventually see one or all of these arrive via Magic Lantern's inevitable piggyback firmware. New to the 70D is onboard stereo sound. It has an ambiance that the mono mics from the 60D and 7D can't match, but like every onboard setup, it picks up camera and lens noise in quiet environments. There's a jack for an external mic. Maximum recording time is a half-hour. Battery life is 1-2 hrs depending on temperature, AF use, and lens stabilization, though you can double it with the battery grip.Image quality is Canon's status quo despite the new compression. Color and contrast are strong by default. Resolution hasn't changed: it's somewhat soft at 1080p, but in a way that's only apparent with high-detail scenics or when shown back-to-back with Panasonic's GH3 or a video-only body like the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. Moir\u00e9 control (of false coloring and interference patterns on subjects with repeating fine detail) is decent. Better than the 6D, short of the 5D III. You'll still see some edge-crawling with horizontal features. Noise is subtle enough until about ISO 800.A key returning feature is Movie Digital Zoom. It's a menu option last available with the T3i that lets you zoom from 3X to 10X in 1080p mode. The higher zoom levels aren't that interesting, but 3X mode has 1:1 pixel mapping, so you lose very little quality. It's effectively a free teleconverter without the light loss. In 35mm terms, it turns your kit 18-135 into 600mm on the long end. Two caveats: it only works with contrast-detect AF and it can't be enabled while recording is in progress. Macro shooting and the sort of fixed composition and focus shots common to professional productions benefit most.Like the 7D and 60D before it, the sole on-camera editing controls trim the beginning and end of the clip. Achieving that on a computer takes surprising effort. If you're not post-processing, shoot in IPB, trim the footage in-camera, copy it to your system, and use Handbrake or AVS Video Converter to bring it down to a size suitable for Youtube or Vimeo. IPB doesn't hold up to major changes in colors or tone curve in post; choose ALL-I for a more serious production.What are we missing? Mostly out-of-the-box thinking. Given what Magic Lantern has added to the 5D III (raw video, HDR video, a thousand other features) solely through reverse-engineering, one wonders where Canon might have gone. Even the more prosaic 1080p/60 and a less indifferent downsampling algorithm would have been appreciated. Still, I've a greater appreciation for what's already there now that it's actually in focus.LENSES:Both kit lenses are excellent. The 18-135 STM is much improved over the USM version that came with the 60D and earlier kit choices like the 28-135 USM. Strong points include a smooth zoom action, no zoom creep, and nearly inaudible focus and stabilization. It's a little heavy and bulky compared to the 18-55 STM, but I'd still favor the longer zoom range. There's no image-quality benefit to the shorter lens.Some thoughts on future additions:* Primes are often lighter, smaller, cheaper, available in wider apertures, optically better, and subject to less less manufacturing variation. They're less convenient, less versatile, updated less often, and can cause you to miss shots in fast-paced shooting environments.* An f/2.8 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash. You'll want a flash for anything slower. A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.* Third-party lenses tend to have less initial cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs. AF and optical performance is often (but not always) inferior to OEM lenses, quality control and service can be less consistent, and resale values are lower. Value varies by lens model. Some are better than the OEM equivalents (e.g., Tamron 70-300 VC, Sigma 35/1.4). Some fill holes in the OEM lineup (e.g., Sigma 50-150/2.8 OS, 30/1.4, 18-35/1.8). And some are lesser substitutes, but still competitive (e.g., Sigma 10-20/4-5.6).Try Canon's 85/1.8 if you're looking for an economical leap in subject isolation relative to the kit lenses.MEMORY:Video chews through storage space. A 32GB SD card is good for about 45 minutes with ALL-I compression and two hours with IPB. 8GB and 16GB cards are plenty for stills. Size aside, interface responsiveness isn't much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer high-speed raw bursts (up to 22-23), clear the picture buffer more quickly, and record video at the highest quality without risking a speed warning. In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.IN SUM:This is the most significant DSLR Canon has introduced since the 7D. It's the first one I've reviewed without some major caveat. And that's unusual. Canon doesn't often make game-changing cameras. They do what they did with the 30D, T3i, T5i, and 6D: make incremental improvements and leave a lot on the table. That's not what happened here, and so much the better. The 70D is significant because it has most of the 7D's AF unit, which is serious business because Canon differentiates cameras with AF performance. It's significant because Canon has licked the movie AF problem that stopped me from ever recommending a DSLR to normal people for movies, while leapfrogging even Sony's pellicle-mirror DSLR-alikes, a former class leader. And it's significant because it combines these upgrades with a physical and touch UI that makes them accessible to a broad cross-section of users. Truly, well-played.But should you buy one? Maybe. Like every new DSLR, it's expensive, and the old ones depreciate like dairy products. There's no question the major upgrades are in Live View. If you're all about stills through the viewfinder, plenty of bodies from the 40D onward could satisfice. But for videos with moving subjects, this is the zero square. There's nothing from Canon behind it. If I had $700 to buy a movie DSLR that would fit into a small bag, I'd save another $500 and buy a bigger bag rather than take the SL1 over the 70D.vs. 7D - New at $1500, the 7D's a nonstarter. Used at $750 and with the enhancements from firmware 2.0, it's a bargain for viewfinder stills if you don't need silent shooting. It's faster, more usable, more configurable, and built like rocks. It's also short an articulating touchscreen and completely inept in movies without manual focus, but focus peaking in Magic Lantern makes that easier.vs. 60D - New, it's barely half the price of this 70D. Viewfinder focus is pretty decent, the framerate is high enough if you're not relying on your pictures for dinner, and it has the same nifty articulating LCD less the touchscreen. A fine camera. I'd buy that used 7D first without a second thought.vs. T5i - At $750, this camera is $150 more than the 60D. It has the awkward honor of being a consumer-class device that's harder to use in movie mode than the semi-pro 70D. That accompanies a lesser build, lesser physical UI, very small raw buffer, no Wifi, no AF-M, no top LCD, no movie zoom, and the 60D's older phase-array AF. To me, the step down is not worth $450.vs. 6D - This full-frame body has appeared for $1500 in some places. It has far better noise control in low light: almost two full stops on the 70D, with a very sensitive center AF point to match. Physical size and layout are similar, but framerate and motion tracking with the main phase array are way behind, as is Live View AF. No LCD tilt or touch. Full-frame lenses cost half again more. The 70D is a better choice for most people, but weigh the 6D if you shoot methodically and care most about subject isolation and low-light performance.vs. Nikon D7100 - Stills have more detail and dynamic range and respond better to post-processing. The main AF array is better than the 70D's and more configurable, but offset by a 6-frame raw buffer. No LCD tilt or touch. No Wifi. Dual SD cards. AF assist lamp. Intervalometer. The physical UI is better, though the menu UI is less polished, as are some software features. Video can be uncompressed over HDMI and 1080i/60, but motion AF is Rebel T5i-caliber. On the system side, Canon has better service and cheaper lenses in some categories. Stills would have to be a much higher priority than movies to favor this over the 70D.Post if you have any questions -- I'll answer them.

The \"bad\" part of this is that I have to agree with the reviewers that complain about the control wheel feeling \"cheap\". It does, and it scares me, but so far it has worked flawlessly.  Beyond this however the camera has more than met my expectations straight out of the box.

It's seriously one of the smartest upgrades I've ever made. I also own a 5DMIII, and that camera is amazing as most owners of it can tell you, but still, the auto focus on the 5DMIII isn't in the same field as the 70D.

I was most interested in the new continuous focus while shooting video...especially with non-STM lenses.  I bought the 18-135mm STM lens as a package.  I used my 85mm L lens and shot at f/1.2 and 35mm L and shot at f/1.4 to really test its ability. The camera was able to continuously focus very well.  When it did lose the focal point I was able to quickly redirect it without stopping the action.  Big improvement over the 60D.  The 18-135 STM was very smooth and was more accurate at maintaining focus.  It won't replace a small handheld video camera anytime soon for most casual occasions....but someday it might. I used the Wifi functions on the iPad 3/Macbook Pro.  A big plus is that you can touch the LCD to type in passwords, etc.  It worked as promised with a solid Wifi connection.

The photos came out amazing. I myself am very much an amateur and this is my first DSLR - while this is not the most basic in Canon's line-up, as with a lot of tech, I tend to go with the more pro-sumer models so there is plenty of room to grow before needing to upgrade down the line. I had been waiting a few years for Canon to release the perfect model with the right feature set for me, and the 70D is it. There are a lot of auto or semi-auto modes good for the beginner, as well as full manual controls (which is really why you would want to buy a camera like this anyway). The camera has excellent build quality without being too heavy. Live view looks great on the articulating screen, though I surprisingly quickly realized I much preferred the viewfinder (which also incidentally saves a TON of battery power - during our shoot we shot 478 photos (without flash) over 2.5 hrs, almost exclusively using the viewfinder, and included battery was still full when we were done). The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.

Via wifi one can control the shutter or transfer pictures wirelessly.  You can see exactly what the camera sees from your phone's screen!  This is a great feature because you don't have to buy a dedicated shutter release.Canon was super smart about how they implemented this wireless connectivity.  The camera itself creates an access point that your device can attach to.  Once you've connected your phone to the camera's hotspot you just launch the Canon app.  You can even change the shutter speed and aperture on the camera from your phone.The screen on this camera is AWESOME!  It can pivot and turn allowing you to take pictures without being forced to look through the eye hole.  The screen is vivid and colorful.  Oh, and by the way, the screen is touch controlled.  At first I kind of laughed at this feature, like \"ha, who would ever use that?\"  I can't tell you how awesome the touch screen is, it's sensitive and accurate and a complete pleasure to work with.  What's better is that almost every control you might ever need to adjust while shooting is accessible through the screen, meaning you don't have to fumble around with buttons, knobs or navigate menus to adjust your shot settings.The 70D has a reasonable HDR shooting mode, which is a function I always want on my cameras.  Some of the Sony cameras have pretty awesome HDR, taking up to 7 pictures to combine together.  The 70D can take 3 pictures at different exposures and combine them together, which in many cases is adequate.Of course the picture quality is astounding on Canon's 70D.  Right out of the box I took 3 pictures of friends in my house that just blew me away.  I knew after 10 minutes of shooting with this device that I made the right purchase.I've owned the Canon 20D and 50D in the past.  One thing that always drove me crazy was that the battery meter.  The meter previously had four indications, Full, Medium, Low and flashing (very low).  On my previous cameras the battery meter would show full, then be at low, skipping the midrange all together.  The Canon 70D's battery meter is far more accurate, meaning you aren't surprised by a dead battery all of a sudden.While we're at it, the battery life is superb on the 70D.I never really cared much about shooting video with my cameras before.  The 70Ds video shooting is SO incredibly good that I am now looking for opportunities to record things!  Last night I recorded my friend's harp recital.  I was standing in the doorway across the room and just using the built in microphone.  The sound was good (though one can purchase a wireless microphone for better sound), and the video quality was out of this world.The only real complaint I have with this camera is that it seems challenged by scenes with highly differing contrasts.  The first evening after receiving the 70D I went for walk a little bit before sunset.  I was taking pictures of brick buildings with the sky above them.  The brick looked overly dark and lacked detail.  I had several other similar experiences shooting with bright skies.  The pictures were so concerning I called Canon tech support (which was excellent by the way).  They looked at my raw images and said the camera was fine.After using the 70D for some time now I've learned to compensate by setting the ISO to auto or adjusting the metering mode.  Most DSLRs I've owned have had their own \"personality.\"  Learning the nuances of these cameras takes a little time.All in all, this is by far the best camera I've ever owned.

I'm a pro. My specialty is product and jewelry photography, and some fashion. For Fashion I use  Nikon D800, for everything else, Canons. Anyhow, we make promotional videos and have been using the 5D Mk ii and iii, and they are great, but auto focus is troublesome at best. So when I read about the 70D I decided to go for it with the 18-135 lens and a super fast 80mb/s transfer rate memory card, are real must for high end video. I chose the Wasabi spare batteries over Canon, always do because they are better than the original Canon Batteries and a lot more affordable, must have spares, and that was it for the purchase. When the camera arrived I jumped right in. If you have experience with Canon cameras it is easy to adapt. I went through everything without reading the manual, and then hit a snag with video audio levels, so then I went for the manual which was no help, so then to the info Disc that comes with all Canons. Ahhh, there it is. It is the single issue I have with the 70D... the audio control is buried and also not as flexible as it needs to be (NEEDS TO BE, hello Canon, READ THIS).Otherwise the video on the 70D is light years ahead of anyone else in DSLRs. The focusing system is killer, image quality is superb, and the audio, once found and set is sufficiently good, it is stereo.The still shots from the 70D are in line with a 5D mark ii. You can read the specs for the other features, that's not my job here.Some people said the camera feels cheap... not at all, not sure what crawled up their pipe to make them say that... you buy a 70D because you're not buying a 5D mk iii or 1DX. The one complaint I have of all Canon cameras is the software... it is lame compared to Nikon Software (they offer priced pro versions, Canon does not) you have to have PhotoShop when you have a Canon, and it makes no sense because I know Canon could easily enhance their editing software (NEEDS TO BE, hello Canon, READ THIS). Keep it in context and the 70D is the best all around camera Canon has ever made by far. I paid $1,199 on Amazon, look for that price, the package deals are not good deals yet, maybe in a year, but for now get the 70D with the 18-135mm STM lens and be super happy.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great image quality & amazing autofocus!", "Author": "P.K. Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "ReviewID": "R3IWEVV2JC75C2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 70D is targeted at advanced photo and video hobbyists, packing cutting edge technology and sophisticated features into a compact body. It's also a familiar camera--at least to EOS shooters--feeling like a marriage of prior models: form factor and controls of the 60D and AF and viewfinder of the 7D. Toss in Wi-Fi, enhanced high ISO, a new 20.2MP Dual Pixel CMOS and that's the 70D in a nutshell.CONSTRUCTION boasts superb fit and finish: polycarbonate body shell, matte black paint and stainless steel undercarriage for strength. Thick textured rubber and finger groove make for a secure grip. The shutter has the same metallic click-clack as the 60D and is louder than the 7D and 6D. Fortunately, silent drive mode fades operation to pianissimo, making it idea for stage and ceremonies.Like the 60D, the 70D has a crystal clear 3.0\" 1,040,000 dot LCD. The big deal is the addition of touch screen ability. Touch sensitivity is as good as an iPhone 5 and ideal for LiveView shooting in dim light. The swivel LCD is handy for video and ground level macro. The only negative of the LCD is it hits L-plates and flash brackets when swiveled to the side.CONTROLS: DSLRs are about control and nobody buys one to use in full auto. Don't like the results of auto exposure or AF? They're easy to override or directly control. Plus, controls and features may be customized, allowing multiple ways to do the same thing. For example, I assigned electronic level activation to the DOF button and programmed C mode with my favorite drive, AF and exposure settings.Buttons and wheels feel solid and can be operated while looking through the viewfinder. If coming from a 50D or 7D, you'll need to adjust to the lack of a joystick, flash exposure compensation (FEC) button and white balance button. However, you can assign FEC to the SET button and a FEC scale appears in the viewfinder. Finally, the 7D's toggle switch for LiveView and video migrated to the 70D, a big improvement over the 60D's clumsy Mode dial video.AUTOFOCUS: The 70D inherited the 7D's blazing fast 19-point cross type AF array. I found it senstitive and sure-footed in most light. Canon only included three of the 7D's five AF modes: zone, manual selection and 19-point auto. Spot and expanded point AF are MIA. Nevertheless, a big step up from 9-point 60D AF.Using single point AF mode (manual selection of a single point) and a tripod, I shot test patterns both flat and inclined with several lenses. AF was highly accurate, locking on the point I selected on my inclined ruler. And it was consistent in performance from close focus to infinity. On the other hand, the 19-point auto select mode didn't do well with the ruler (flat target was fine). It was not able to guess which line I wanted in focus and varied with each shot. I expected this to happen but it illustrates photographers need to control the point of focus and shouldn't expect cameras to read their mind. All three modes performed perfectly at infinity and with flat objects.New DSLR users need to understand that the three main AF modes are not designed to recognize human faces like a point and shoot or iPhone. However, face recognition AF is available in LiveView and video modes.In real world use I found auto focus excellent. However, there are dozens of AF options and it took me weeks to figure out what worked best for me. Manually selecting individual AF points is amazingly accurate: near 100% hit rate for difficult subjects, e.g., macro or tight facial portraits (lock on an eye). On the other hand, 19-point auto-select is fast--press 'n lock--but often guesses wrong--maybe a 75% hit rate. Cameras aren't smart enough to make a choice between a rock, tree or cloud, so I avoid 19-point auto select mode and full auto. Finally, Zone focus is the best of both worlds: you pick the zone--top, bottom, center, right or left--and the camera guesses at the subject within the selected area. Zone focus is perfect for stopped down shooting with wide angle lenses and shooting from the hip, e.g., street photography, close to a 100% hit rate when used for the right situation.IMAGE QUALITY is the same as the 60D from ISO 100 to 800, i.e., great! I developed RAW images in Aperture and DPP and was pleased with the detail, color rendition and noise control. At ISO 1600 and above the 70D pulls away from the 60D with a notch better noise performance. The 70D has slightly less noise than the 60D at high ISO but, most significantly, noise is less prone to banding artifacts and more grain-like. Also, grain-like noise is easier to control with noise reduction plug-ins like Topaz Denoise: I can squeeze out another stop of acceptable high ISO over my 60D (or lift shadows more aggressively).VIDEO: I'm primarily a still photographer but shoot video occasionally. And yet I found video operation on the 70D surprisingly easy. First, contrast detection AF during video is a mammoth improvement from previous DSLRs: faster, movie servo AF grabs faces like magic and focus-pulls are a snap with the touch screen. However, focus is poky compared to M4/3 cameras, e.g., Olympus Pen E-P5. That said, the improved contrast detection AF is a great feature, especially for holiday video shooters! You can use manual focus if you need more control. If you disable face recognition AF speeds up considerably.I shoot video of my ensemble, Leeward Coast Guitars (search on YouTube), and the file size limit of 4GB (FAT spec) spoiled long pieces: most DSLRs stop recording midway in the track! The 70D solves this gotcha by automatically and seamlessly spliting files greater than 4GB for extended video recording.Think of EOS Wi-Fi as a fancy remote control: via the EOS Remote app you can set exposure, select AF points, fire the shutter, etc. You can use LiveView or save images on your iPhone, iPad or Droid. Wi-Fi eats batteries fast, so carry spares. My main complaint is Wi-Fi is needlessly complicated to set up. Also, you can't upload directly to FB or photo sharing sites but, instead, must upload to Canon's awkward cloud based photo service and transfer from there.VIEWFINDER: Optical viewfinder quality is excellent. The specs of 98% coverage and .95x magnification are less than the 100% coverage and 1.0x of the 7D. However, viewfinder clarity and brightness are a level above the 60D and 7D. Even with a F4 zoom the viewfinder is a pleasure to use: bright, grainless, smooth and vivid. The transmissive LCD display--transparent LCD over the focusing screen--can display icons, AF patterns, metering patterns, grid and plain matte screens and an electronic level.FLASH: The popup flash is great for fill and snapshots, and functions as a wireless E-TTL master. My 430EX II worked great as a slave bounced off walls and ceilings. Both bounce and direct flash images were well exposed. This is one of the few cameras I rarely need to touch FEC.FINAL BURB: The 70D is a petite, nimble and capable instrument, and a significant upgrade over the 60D.

I've had the T2i for around 2 years and even though it can take great pictures (IMHO) I find the camera lacking, mainly in focus points and burst/buffer. I mainly shoot sports (often basketball) and events, so low light performance is important for me. For sports I shoot 1/400 upwards and up to ISO 3200 with the T2i and with post processing I turn in a lot of good shots. On the 70D, I shoot the same settings (for now) but ISO 3200 shots look cleaner and I've had a lot more shots that did not need any post noise reduction. Also, I've had a lot more in focus shots, the focusing system is leaps and bounds what I was used to. Using my trusty EF 85 f/1.8 shooting sports has never been better. I was thinking of waiting for the successor to the 7D, but I figured if and when it does arrive I probably can't even afford it. Anyone coming from a Rebel body will feel this is a significant step up. Highly recommended.UPDATE 11/11/13: A month using this camera and I am very pleased with the performance. Battery life is almost twice than the T2i. Read some reviews and most are saying the image quality is incremental from the previous 18MP Canon but after editing hundreds of RAW files the noise is well managed and colors seem more vivid. I tried to keep my T2i ISO at 800 (or lower) as much as possible, with the 70D the 1600 is the new 800. On a side note, I'm glad that I am able to use a 3rd party (Photive) battery for this.

It's easier to trick the camera in low light, but I think this is the best video I have ever shot with a camera. The audio seems to be on par or above with most cameras in this price range. But, a nice shotgun mike would probably make a nice addition for the serious videographer. I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago. However, to me this has never been an issue since I ALWAYS carry a spare battery. I may consider a battery grip for this camera and have owned a couple of Canon battery grips with previous Canons. As a result, battery life has never been much of a concern for me.Speed: The speed of the camera is excellent and I have worked in situations where I fired a number of bursts with great success.Form Factor: I think this is a nicely sized camera and the controls are very well placed for my hands. Everyone has different hands and mine tend to be a little smaller. But, I do like the size and feel of this Canon. It is significantly larger than the Rebels and I think that is what I like about it since I always felt the Rebel was a bit small.On-camera Flash: The last thing I'll mention is the on-camera flash. It's the best I have used yet. Hands down. I am not a big flash user because I shoot a lot of naturally lit subjects. But, I have used this one with a lot of success and am pleasantly surprised at how well it works.Overall, I can't say anything bad about this camera. I wish I could offer up something constructive. But it appears as though Canon got everything right in this one. Even the interface...though I am sure there will be plenty of nit-pickers out there, the interface is pretty intuitive with minimal use.This is truly the best Canon I have ever owned.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the upgrade from a Rebel - amazing auto-focus and packed with great features", "Author": "BVIKE", "ReviewID": "R1T1XHWP5YT2ZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using my Canon Rebel T1i/500D for about 4 years, and investing in some nice lenses (EF-S 18-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, EF 50mm f/1.4 USM, EF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 IS USM) I decided I needed to upgrade my camera body and take advantage of some of the latest technology to improve my shots.  I have had the Canon 70D for about a month now, and I am super happy with my purchase so far.I had two main reason for wanting an upgrade to my camera body:  (1) I wanted improved AF options, as with the shallow depth of field of some of my lenses, I often had a hard time using the AF on the T1i and getting the right object in focus.  The T1i has a limited number of AF points, no Cross-Type points, and manually selecting the AF point is not easy on the T1i.  (2) I have started shooting more video with my DSLR, and I was intrigued with the Dual Pixel auto-focus ability of the 70D.  When choosing a new body, I narrowed my choices down to the 6D and the 70D.  In the end, I chose the 70D because of the increased number of cross-type AF points (19), and the new Dual Pixel AF for shooting video, and it comes at a lower price (while clearly sacrificing some of the image quality of the full-frame sensor on the 6D).  I also got to keep all my current lenses with the 70D, whereas my EF-S lenses would not have worked on the 6D.After shooting with the 70D for a month, here are my impressions so far:Pros:-AF!  The Auto-Focus is light years ahead of the T1i, and my shots have improved significantly as a result.  I love the ability to switch quickly between the 3 different AF options by hitting the small button next to the shutter release button.  I usually leave it in the Auto-Selection AF mode, and found that the 19 cross-type AF points do a MUCH better job of auto-selecting the focus points.  When the camera doesn't select the right objects, I usually switch to single-point selection, and then use the toggle on the back of the camera to move to the correct point.  I can do all of this in about 1-second while still looking through the viewfinder the whole time.-Flip-Out Touch-screen LCD:  I didn't realize how much I would like this, but I really do.  I have used the flip-out option several times when shooting at odd angles using the LiveView option, or when shooting video.  The touch-screen also works very well, with all the familiar gestures from your touch-screen phone (swipe to view next photo, pinch to zoom, etc.).  I also like that in Live-View, I can simply touch the screen on the point I want the camera to focus on, and the camera focuses to that point and releases the shutter.-WiFi: I have found the WiFi most useful for using the EOS Remote app on my iPhone to remotely view photos, or control the camera from my iPhone.  Similar to the camera's own touch-screen, I can use a \"LiveView\" on my iPhone and simply touch my iPhone screen on the focal point and the camera focuses and releases the shutter.  You can also remotely change all the settings of the camera from the phone.  I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive Modes:  The camera has a lot of great drive modes, including a burst-mode of 7 per second.  I also like that is has a silent drive mode, which is something I didn't have on the T1i and is great when shooting during a quiet event.-Dual-Pixel AF with video.  This works as advertised, and I found playing the the 3 different AF options to be really easy to use and intuitive.  You can either have it auto-focus and track faces (works well if the face isn't moving too fast), AF zone mode (meaning you choose a certain zone of the screen and the camera focuses on whatever moves into that zone), or just touch a point on the screen and the camera will focus to it until you touch somewhere else.-Viewfinder:  The viewfinder is light years ahead of my T1i.  I can tell much more easily if I am in focus and I also have enjoyed using the level option (a little icon tells you if you are holding the camera level or tilting it to one side or another).Cons:-The camera is much bigger and heavier than the T1i.  In some ways this is better to balance out the weight of some of my lenses, but still it is definitely heavier and larger than what I am used to holding/carrying for the last 4 years.-Plastic-feel - I was hoping for over $1,000+ camera-body that it would feel less plasticky, but unfortunately this one does not.  I guess you need to move up to the 5D to get a more metallic-feel to the camera.-Focus noise in video.  While the AF works well in video, unless you have the new STM lens, the focusing makes a lot of clicking noises that are picked up in your video.  My USM lenses are really loud in the video.  I really wish now that I had gotten the kit-lens so I at least had one STM lens for shooting video, especially when I know I want the ambient audio to sound clean and am not just planning to dub over music or something.-Only one card slot.  Would have been nice to add the extra card slot for more video-shooting capacity, or backing up photos.Final thoughts: If you are thinking of upgrading from a camera-body similar to the T1i/500D, this camera offers a huge jump in technology that makes a big difference in the quality of your shots and video, as well as some huge improvements in convenience and usability (flip-out touch-screen LCD, WiFi, improved viewfinder, etc.).  I think you get a lot of value for the price, if you are willing to live without a full-frame sensor, I can't imagine a better camera for hobbyist photo and video enthusiasts for this price.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review mostly for still image photography and compared to 6D and T2i (550D)", "Author": "rai777", "ReviewID": "RVLIMKP4P8QDB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Second Update (3/15): I tried another sample and phase detection autofocus works a lot better on this one.  Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher. If this would have been my first copy, I probably would have never noticed (as I would not have looked at it that critically).  The noise is surprisingly a little worse than on my first copy and matches that of my T2i exactly.  So I bumped it up a star, but not back to the original 4 stars, given the existence of QC problems and lack of improvement in sensor performance.===========================================================================================================================Update: While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.  It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots. In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.  I wanted to like it and gave it a few more tries and chances, but the results were consistent (in a bad way).  Not acceptable in my book.===========================================================================================================================I understand that the \"game changing\" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.  Just briefly, I did try it out and it is a tremendous step up. I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.  I have not had the camera for long, so I'm not covering close to all features, but focus on the primary ones (80/20 rule).It was between the T5i, 60D and the 70D for me, prior to picking the 70D.Pros:- While just a bit smaller, the body is almost identical to the 6D, with similar layout and pretty much the same feel (which I love).  For some, who want more ruggedness, such as found in the 7D or 5D's, this might be a negative.  However, if I look at my trusty Rebel T2i, which has been used in rain, on the beach, thrown in the backpack on many bike rides and abused in hours and hours of astrophotography sessions (usually covered in frozen dew), it still looks and behaves almost like new.  So I think the 70D will do just fine.- Touch flip screen. I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.  Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.  Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.- Auto-focus. I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.  I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.  The camera was tracking nicely when shooting a low flying eagle against the background of trees and fields.- 7 fps.  Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).- Good kit lens.  Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.  I posted a separate review under the individual lens item on Amazon.  In summary, well worth it the extra money.- Wireless.  Same as the 6D.  Using your smart phone or iPad/iPod as a remote, without much complications, is something that I got hooked on with the 6D.- Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.  Some stated concerns that the new sensor design (with the split photodiodes per pixel) might have a negative impact here. But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.  Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same. In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below. Only for higher ISO and longer exposures one can see a little improvement (but not much more than you can expect in variances from the same sensor model).  The only significant difference is that DPP takes a lot longer to generate the high definition view...  Now, in a way, that still justifies having a full frame camera (and I prefer the smaller APS-C sensor for astrophotography and wild life), the 6D is just an order of magnitude better when it comes to image quality, but one could have hoped for some improvements over the last 4-5 years here.  Others have done it.Note: Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.  For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.  Setting noise reduction to 0 (or the same value) for both, will make such differences mostly go away...Overall, the additional features (such as wireless, better auto-focus, better body, LCD display) make it worth the higher price compared to the T5i and 60D (at least the first two here) to me, but ultimately, you can probably take the same quality still pictures with all three (at least if the subject is not moving too fast...).", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Technological Masterpiece", "Author": "cocre", "ReviewID": "R34VIG7JLS363C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can read long detailed reviews elsewhere, I just want to add my two cents. At first I compared the Canon T5i to the Nikon D3200 and settled on the Nikon, but when I went to hit the order button the price of the Nikon kit had gone up by several hundred dollars so I went the next level up and started over. After much research I settled for the Canon 70D over the Nikon D7100. As a straight up still camera, the Nikon holds the edge, but when all things are considered I thought the Canon the better fit for me.I really like the built in wireless. You can use it with the Canon apps to take simple shots or the third party DSLR Controller app (Android) and control many if not most of the 70D functions from your droid phone or tablet. The autofocus with the STM kit lens is so quiet, you think is must not be working. It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot. Absolutely no noise from the lens is picked up in the audio. The onboard flash is weak, but when coupled with the Canon Speedlite 430EX II flash they can work as a master/slave team and \u201ctalk\u201d to one another to provide superb results.The Canon 70D is a technological masterpiece.

(1) Fully automatic uses the Special Scene Mode (SCN) called HDR Backlight Control mode. Three continuous shots are taken at different exposures then in-camera processed into one JPEG image, with a wide tonal range, that minimizes blocked-up shadows and improves highlights. (2) With more control options, use the HDR (High Dynamic Range) Shooting mode found under the camera 4 tab. Again, three images of different exposures are automatically captured then in-camera merged resulting in a single JPEG image. This mode allows selection of the exposure range to as much as +- 3 EV. It also allows for doing this once or for every shot until the setting is disabled. You can also select whether the images are Auto Image Aligned (in-camera) or not.

In terms of dynamic range and overall still quality/sharpness the 7100 is a little better. If pictures are really your only concern than you may be better off with that model. In terms of an overall package though - the 70D is hard to beat at this level.I give the final edge to the 70D based on the complete package you get. IQ - the 7100 is a touch ahead. The 70D is better in many areas though - namely usability. The 70D is so easy to use and change settings with, thanks to the capacitive touch screen which is just like the touch screen on a nice smartphone. The 70D has great high ISO performance with usable shots up to about 6400 ISO or maybe even a touch higher (personal use of course). The 70D is one of the best cameras when it comes to video as well. This is one area where the 70D beats the D7100 quite badly. Pair this camera with an STM lens and you've got camcorder like video on a DSLR.The 18-135mm kit lens gives you a great range as a walk around lens. For casual photographers this lens + a fast prime (50mm 1.8) will probably be all you'll ever need. If you're into other types of photography such as landscape photography then you'll want a 10-22, 11-16, or a long telephoto for wildlife like a 55-250 (budget option), etc. There's a good bit of distortion on the wide end, but if you're a casual photographer it doesn't matter much, and you can always fix it easily in lightroom or photoshop. The lens is relatively sharp, especially for a kit lens.Overall, if you think you might ever want to shoot video then I'd definitely take this over Nikon, Sony, or any other manufacturer's current offerings in the price range.

I am an intermediate level family photographer with advanced knowledge of computer software and tech gadgets. Canon 70D is my first DSLR which I got about a week ago. Previously I had film SLR, several advanced digital cameras and camcorders. I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light. I have to say this is a wonderful camera which suits my needs. Every good thing you read regarding this camera's focusing ability, video capabilities, LiveView (LV) shooting is mostly true. There are a few shortcomings, most of which I think can be corrected with future firmware updates (if Canon wishes).1. The Wi-Fi feature is great for sending photo to your phone or tablet or email or sharing on social media sites but it needs to be disabled manually for movie shooting and USB connection which is very annoying. Wi-Fi should automatically get disabled when switching to Movie mode or when USB cable is connected (with a pop-up message).2. I miss the AF assist light. Good thing is the strobe flash AF assist has a good range and works with most lens but the strobe flash AF assist has some limitations as mentioned below (apart from startling your photographed subject).3. LiveView (LV) focusing is absolutely brilliant with the touch to focus capability. But in low light AF assist strobe fires only in ViewFinder (VF) mode and not in LV mode. Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all! After communicating with Canon support, I tried the P mode and found in P-mode only if AF quick mode is selected, AF assist works. However in AF quick mode you cannot select a region to focus (tap to focus)!4. The horizontal level indicator is a neat feature but in LV mode there is no way to show the level while shooting (as an overlay).5. Also I didn't find a way to enable/disable flash using the \"Quick Control\" button in advanced modes such as P. It is however present in basic modes such as A+!6. While capturing video if you want to take a still photo, there is quite a few frame drops (about 1 sec as mentioned in the manual) even when using SD card with 95mb/s speed. My old Canon camcorder has \"Dual Shot\" without any frame-drop. I wish Canon could implement \"dual shot\" in this camera as well.7. In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8. The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF. I think including this option (at least in the creative auto (CA) mode) would have been a good thing for novice users.9. Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode. This will be really helpful if you are using SCN mode as there is no way to know what scene you have previously selected in the top LCD.In summary this is great camera for taking excellent quality photo and video in most situations (including low light). As Canon has incorporated so many features in this camera for the LiveView (LV) shooting, I think they need to include all the features of ViewFinder (VF) shooting in LV mode and tweak the firmware a little bit. Also I have to say, I am extremely glad I made this purchase.UPDATE (9/24/2013): Regarding electronic horizontal level indicator. It is possible to show it as overlay in Live View (LV) mode but only when you are not using \"face detection + tracking\"!!!Also when you are using continuous shooting in LV mode the screen becomes blank! The canon customer service said it is not possible to capture image and show the live view at the same time. This means continuous shoot is not useable in LV mode!", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!* (But it doesn't play nice with 3rd party lenses!)", "Author": "Parker", "ReviewID": "R1FW55BSDFDI8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buying a new camera is so difficult... at first i couldn't decide between this camera, or taking the plunge and going full-frame with the only slightly more expensive 6D, or just waiting for the oft-rumored but finally (apparently) confirmed 7D mark II... but i went with the 70D, and I am happy with my decision, here's why:Although i do shoot a decent amount of still photography, I mainly wanted a dslr for filmmaking and videography. If you're reading this review, you already know about the 70D's insanely cool autofocusing technology. Let me tell you this.. it is worth the hype! it definitely works. Whether you're focusing on the foreground, background, or anything in between, with just a tap of the touchscreen the 70D will smoothly and decisively pull focus right to where you want it, every time, without the nasty searching/bouncing back and forth that made autofocus infamously unusable on older cameras/autofocus systems. I think that lots of filmmakers are so used to pulling focus manually that they scoff at the idea of an autofocus system doing the work for them, but it makes nailing the shot so much faster/easier, so why not?! It has facial tracking, so you can really just set the camera up, frame your scene and roll, and have all the confidence in the world that whether your talents are approaching or moving away from the camera or whatever, they will stay in perfect, crisp focus. This allows me to shoot faster lenses at really wide apertures for that glorious shallow depth of field all dslr filmmakers lust after, and not worry about the talent's face going out of focus with the slightest head bob.I bought the 70D body only without the STM kit lenses most are shipping with. On my nifty fifty canon 50mm 1.8 i get fantastic image quality, but the lens motor does make a bit of noise, that can sometimes be noticeable. This is the same with my Tamron 28-75 f2.8 (fantastic lens for the 70D, by the way)(<-- SAD DAY!It's actually not, see edit below) but it doesn't matter much to me since i record audio separately away from the camera with a zoom recorder anyway, and just sync later in post, but apparently these new STM lenses are whisper quiet, so they would take care of that focusing noise, if it mattered to me. At some point i plan on purchasing the 40mm 2.8 STM pancake lens, because i hear it's a great bargain lens for this camera, and it wouldn't hurt to have that silent shooting option if needs be, but for now the main lenses that i use, the 50mm and 28-75mm, are just fine on the 70D.I also really like the articulated touch screen, it is so convenient! My first night of shooting with the 70D i had to stand on a rickety ladder and hold the camera up above my head to get the shot that i wanted. On a normal camera this would have been impossible as i couldn't see the screen, but not on the 70D! it was a cinch to simply flip out the screen and rotate it down to easily pull focus and see what i was filming. It can also be very useful when you have to be in front of the camera, and are still trying to control what goes on behind it, as you can just rotate the screen all the way forward, and not to have to pester whatever unlucky friend you roped into helping you film your project every five seconds about what the shot looks like, lighting, focus, etc.I have read several reviews making the bold claim that the 70D is in fact the greatest APS-C sensor camera...ever. I have to say that from the little time i've owned it, i can see why. In the past i have mostly shot on on an older 7D. Head to head, the 70D barely edges out the 7D, but yet the 7D is still like four or five hundred dollars more! The 70D gets you 2 more megapixels, the articulated touch screen, wifi onboard (which i have yet to use, but still) and of course the wondrous video autofocus, as well as the ability to shoot stills in live mode, which is very cool. Both cameras are weather sealed, so there's that. I do miss the solid built-like-a-tank magnesium body of the 7D, but the 70D is simply a better camera all around, and as it should be, it's like 5 years newer!Some reviewers have mentioned that the quick control wheel/dial thing feels cheap and rather chintzy, and i have to concur, it's definitely the 'cheapest' feeling part of the 70d, but with the the other dial on the front near the shutter button as well the touch screen i never really have to use that dial anyway, so it's not really a big deal.Photography wise, i am getting fantastic photos, as i expected. A nice fast frames per second shooting speed and a large enough buffer make shooting lots of pictures very quickly in RAW a breeze, and thus far the camera has performed very well in low light conditions. I have yet to really test the high iso-to-noise ratios, but i expect to perform decently in this aspect as well.Overall, i am very, very pleased with my purchase of this camera. If you're into filmmaking and can't afford a full frame camera, this is the one for you. The autofocus makes everything very easy, and i have heard of filmmakers that prefer this camera over their 5D Mark III. Now I'm just waiting for MagicLantern to get updated for the 70D's firmware and  I will be a very happy man.Edit:A word to the wise: There are well-documented problems with 3rd party lenses (i.e Tamron, Sigma, etc.) functioning properly while recording video on the 70D. I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem. It shoots stills just fine, but the moment i try and shoot video, after a very brief period of time (like maybe 30 seconds to a minute) the camera will stop recording and display the dreaded error message \"please ensure that lens is properly attached\". While this seems like it's more the lens manufacturer's fault than canon's, all the same, if you have pricey, high quality 3rd party lenses, or are thinking of purchasing some for this camera (let's be honest, so much cheaper than canon's own lenses, it's really hard not to) just don't be surprised if they don't play nice while shooting video on the 70D. :(", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "This camera will spoil you.....", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R2W940TNQUM48L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a lot of different DSLR cameras like the Rebel XT, T3i, 5DM2, SL1, and some Sony NEX and Panasonic FZ cameras too.

I will not go into all of the great features of the 70D since there are plenty of posts to extoll its virtues. However, let me give a little advise.Even if you already have compatible lenses, I encourage you to get this camera WITH one of the kit lenses, not body only. Here is the reason: the two options for kit lenses are STM lenses, which are made to be absolutely silent during autofocus. And on the 70D, the autofocus is used a LOT during video capture. My non-STM lenses are very very loud when I use them on my 70D to record video - enough to make them nearly unusable for video. So I highly encourage anyone who is looking to get a 70D to get it with one of the kit lenses. When purchased with the body, you get a nice discount on the lens. I have the 18-135 and it is a great lens. Canon does not have many STM lenses at the moment, so don't expect to find many alternatives for video other than the kit lenses. I hope this helps.I upgraded from a 20D, so this is night-and-day difference for me. Also, the amazon price was $1200 when I bought it - and I am surprised that the price has dropped at all.

It's surprisingly accurate, responsive, and fluid. For previewing pictures, it recognizes pinch and zoom and swipe gestures. It's large and bright with a very sharp display.ISO CAPACITYThis camera has amazing ISO. I spent Christmas at a relative's house with a new baby. Unfortunately, the whole house was dimly lit, so I was glad the 70D had some great ISO. I used 3200 ISO with a 60-80 shutter speed to get the exposure right and came away with some great baby shots. The noise in the photos is minimal and the color in the photo is still vivid and accurate.WIFI CAPABILITY & SETUP EFFORTAt first I was disappointed with the WiFi on this camera because it was kind of complicated to set up the first time (no thanks to the vague instruction manual - try YouTube for better tutorials), but once I had it set up, it's been great and connects quite quickly when WiFi is enabled. If you're out in the field without Internet, you can set the camera up to act as a WiFi access point to preview or transfer photos to your smartphone or tablet. However, if you're downloading pictures to your device, a real internet connection will be faster than using the camera as an access point. I think there is room for improvement with the WiFi system and I'm sure they'll be streamlining it in the future.KIT LENSI haven't used the kit lens much so I can't elaborate on it a lot. I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to. But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good. I could probably do an entire day of shooting with the WiFi off without changing batteries. With WiFi on (especially when the camera is acting as the access point), the battery goes pretty quickly. However, as long as you have a backup along, you'll be fine. I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect mid-range DSLR", "Author": "qban", "ReviewID": "R12FAGM0M8JZJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from a T2i the image quality is excellent (specially in low light).

Perhaps it's just that the lowlight capability of the 70D is stronger, but I've been delighted with how well the camera performed (in really cold weather, I might add).

As such I am heavily invested in Canon compatible lenses so any thought of switching to another brand of camera body such as Nikon or Pentax is really out of the question.  So for anyone comparing the 70d to any cameras from competing camera manufacturers this is not the review that you will find most helpful.  But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.  From the first use the 70d is an impressive camera.  It looks, feels, and can operate much like the 60d that I owned previously so I could use it right out of the box.  But as I become more familiar with the 70d I am finding the upgrades from the previous generation are significant and useful in actual use.  The touchscreen is much more than a gimmick, it is my go to method of set up when I turn the camera on.  I can immediately see my settings and make alterations with a touch of a finger.  I find autofocus to be faster and more accurate with all my lenses than had been the case with the 60d.  I appreciate the ability to fine tune the autofocus plus or minus if any lens combination were to yield consistent front or back focusing issues.  I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.  Gone are the red dots that the 60d had replaced by what I find to be more useful squares with increased options for point selection including a zone focusing mode that the 60d lacks.  Net result is that I have more \"keeper\" shots than before.  I tend to default to the viewfinder for my composition but the Live View option on the 70d is so good that I am using it as well.  Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.  The sensitivity of the autofocus points in Live View is also excellent, arguably more accurate than what can be achieved through the viewfinder.  Finally a word about Video performance.  Spectacular!  Again the upgrade from previous models is significant with better focus tracking and wonderful HD performance.  One caution, some third party lenses may not work well in Video mode or may have other compatibility issues with this camera that did not show up on the 60d.  My Tamron 28-70 VC and 18-270 PZD for example failed to record video with this camera body.

They just see no reason to, as they have better things to do with chip real estate.Canon's finally delivered a DSLR that combines the best of still shooting and video without compromising either, although it seems to have knocked their product matrix sideways by rendering the 7D irrelevant. For sports photographers, the blisteringly fast frame rate for still shots is competitive with some very expensive gear indeed. For videographers, video quality is excellent and isn't limited to the 4GB/12 minute shot limit that previous Canon cameras were stuck with; the half-hour recording time is more than enough to make sure you can get a long sequence all at once without having to worry as much about losing some of it between shots. And the autofocus function is one of the most sophisticated I've seen -- the touch screen enables insanely easy spot focus, and though I've not tried it myself, my understanding is that it does quite well with moving objects. Canon has also chosen to opt out of the megapixel wars once again; 20.2Mpx is only a modest upgrade from the 18 that was standard on their previous generation of APS image sensors, but you'll need to invest in some extremely expensive lenses in order to have a reason to care about the difference. (Incidentally, the new 18-55mm STM kit lens is sweet -- fast, silent, and straightforward. It is focus-by-wire, though, so if you're not a fan, get the body without a lens.)It does have a few downsides, but I don't feel like they really affect the star rating. One is that the wifi function is absolutely byzantine -- you will definitely want to read the (separate) wifi manual, and at least in the initial firmware it lacks the web interface that the Wireless File Transfer modules for Canon's higher-end cameras have. (It also supports EyeFi cards, presumably because Canon already had the drivers in the OS build and didn't see a need to take them out.) Another is that I have yet to find an on-screen live audio monitor; Magic Lantern has traditionally provided this as a third-party addon, but they have yet to hack the 70D, so you may have to do some black magic with cables and headphones to get usable audio monitoring. (It also does not yet seem to be supported by gphoto, meaning that using it on a Linux system is likely to be exciting in all the wrong ways.)So, on the whole, this isn't yet a hacker's camera, but for pretty much all regular purposes, it's damn close to perfect.

I also thought it would be great to capture video without having to carry around a second camera. Well, this camera not only met my expectations, but it blew them away!I love the quality of the images and the autofocus seems to be nearly flawless at finding and tracking moving subjects (like dancers and athletes). The low light performance is fantastic with the noise levels almost unnoticeable even at ISO 6400. I no longer get motion blur like I did with my old camera, even when I set my aperture at f/2.8, and the maximum ISO, and only got 1/80 of a second shutter speeds.Additionally the video quality has far exceeded my expectations, although the built-in microphones tend to pick up more ambient noise than I would have expected.

This is my first DSLR, making the jump from point and shoot zoom camera (Panasonic FZ100).  I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.  What I am trying to figure out however is how to zoom while in autofocus? The camera was attractive to me because of the revolutionary auto focus (AF) feature (which works great) and the ability to do video recording without have a camcorder.  Well for the camcorders/ zoom camera with video taping capablities I have used, I am able to manually adjust the zoom to pan out or in on my subjects. However in reading the literature I am warned not to adjust the zoom rings when in AF mode.  So unless I am missing something, how can the camera be comparable to a camcorder?11/30 UpdateSo I have had more time to work with the camera and getting used to its ergonomics.  I strongly recommend that if you are not familiar with the Canon ergonomics to play with it for a while and acclimatize yourself.  There are lots of buttons and dials to press and turn plus the LCD touch screen options, so you have a lot of ground to cover in just knowing what and when to press what. But not to worry, for beginners devote the time to understand the fuctions of the buttons, dials and icons (it is like learning a foreign language, increased use is required for mastery).  I am working with the A+  (Automated) basic mode for starters, (which essentially makes the camera a point and shoot) and reading the instruction manual as I go along. (Yes that is a must as you tend to press buttons and you can get unexpected results).  So I have video-taped (and yes I was able to use the zoom rings on the lens to pan in and out) for the most part th AF works brilliantly, as I was moving the camera across the objecs in my viewing area it failed to focus as it could not make up its mind what the primary object was due to a change in the backdrop as the camera moved horizontally across the plane of view. That is so minor, but I thought you should know and I doubt very much if some will notice this) The quality of the images are very impressive and moreso if you use the Canon supplied software to do some post edting. I take the pictures both in RAW format and JPG to get a sense of comparision.  Please note RAW takes up more memory than JPG.  I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less. So I may post additional updates as I continue to use the camera.  I will be going to the Caribbean next week, which will give me ample opportuity to test the camera even more.12/1  UpdateSo the journey continues and I am really liking this camera, especially once you get over the initial shock and adjustments to the ergonomics and user experience. Canon engineers put a lot of thought into making thi a powerful \"easy to use\" camera.  Dare I say read the supplied instruction manual on the CD (not the handbook) and with camera in hand to cover each section slowly until you get familiar with the settings and usage.  I ued the telephoto 55-250mm IS supplied kit lens and was blown away with image accuracy and quality of the close up shots. I did some close ups of outdoor and family indoor shots under varying lighting conditions and in all instance great images. Once you have played enough with the A+ (Fully Automatic Shooting) mode, I recommend going to the SCENE (Special scene) mode and work through those settings  (Page 81 on the PDF instruction manual). Again each scene mode has auto features enabled (Aperture setting: measuring how much light is allowed to hit the sensor ( f/1  to f/5.6).  The smaller the denominator the wider the aperture, hence allowing more light from the subject to fall on the sensor). Shutter speed, how long th shutter remains open 1/x is also set automatically, as well as the ISO setting.) If you are new to DSLR I strongly recommend you spend some time understanding what these 3 terms mean and how they influence the quality of the picture taken.

The entry level camera recommended on a particular website, at the time, was a Canon Rebel XS. The website was of course outdated. However, I found a Rebel XS on clearance, and so bought it. After accumulating four lenses, I kicked myself for not waiting to buy a Nikon instead. It had all the bells and whistles and the Rebel XS was bare bones. I didn't realize how bare bones until after I bought it. It did force me to learn how to do things manually, however, rather than depend on Nikon's automatic features such as snow, sand, fireworks, etc. scenes mode.Earlier this month, I decided to get a new camera. Of course it had to be a Canon that could fit my previous four lenses. So I looked, and was going to get a 60D, but the online store was out of stock. So I found the 70D. I liked it more because it boasted the auto focus mode like a camcorder, and could shoot video, something sorely abesent on my Rebel XS but prevalent on my earlier model point and shoot camera that was made before the Rebel XS came to market. I did a comparison at a certain website, and the only thing that the Rebel XS beat the 70D in was weight, and that it could turn on and be ready to go just a little bit quicker. I also got the 18-135mm STM lens for video. The lenses I have are very noisy despite two of them being hypersonic motors as their focusing.My only real upset with this is that the infrared remote requires me to be in front before it will take the photo. Maybe it is something all cameras with an infrared sensor has problems with. I was able to utilize the wireless aftermarket shutter remote that I bought for my Canon Rebel XS, and use it without having to manually switch the camera to turn on the infrared sensor and wait for the two second mark. That was a nice surprise, because I thought it wouldn't work.I still have to get used to the focusing bit. Some photos, like one reviewer said, are indeed soft, and I notice it on the black rectangles/squares when I thought it was in focus in the viewfinder, and the photo simply is not. However, the viewfinder size, as well as ISO setting is way beyond my Rebel XS, with a few nice features (Miniature mode and HDR mode is my favorite) thrown in. I wouldn't say the photo quality is much nicer in my opinion, because I have printed out two 11x14s and I really cannot tell a quality difference from 10 MP to 20.2 MP at that size. It could also be attributed to the glass I'm using. I saw one man with a Canon T3i taking photos with a Class L lens while I tested my 70D at a butterfly exhibit (Florida) and so I believe he was getting better photos with the glass being a lot better.For the Nikon users whom might get on here and say that this particular camera sucks, I've been to three different tourist attractions, and for some reason, I've seen only one or two Nikons in a sea of Canons. So apparently Canon is doing something to win over these tourists to Florida. I even helped a woman with her Canon EOS 60D due to it being very similar to the 70D.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for Pro and Novice alike!", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R1ADGB22SJ6VEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon 70D upgrading from a Nikon L820, for the purpose of enhancing my abilities in photography. I studied for about two days before picking this up, never used a DSLR, and it is incredibly easy to use. I only shoot in manual, I don't see an advantage with the other modes. Most people know when it is time for them to upgrade. If your camera does not do what you want it to, it may be time. My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible. The 70D takes amazing pictures with its 20.2 MP sensor, video looks exactly as seen by the naked eye. Although video does have moire when filming fine lines or even lines that are close together. While filming landscapes or indoor environments pretty much non existent. Auto focus is great, manual focus is great. Video is about average when indoors or in low light, but that's to be expected.

I will give a few impressions:Coming from an older, cheaper rebel, this one is so much nicer. The size is larger - almost fits as nice as the full frame ones in your hand. Yes it is heavier, but I really don't notice the weight difference in use. The power switch is opposite, that takes some getting used to. The items that really make a difference - the shutter speed is so much faster, almost too fast. I get 2 or 3 shots when I only want one - although that does work in my favor from time to time. The \"mode\" dial requires a push and turn to change - this is so nice, I can't tell you how many pictures I lost due to the dial turning while putting/removing it from the case before I realized what had happened. The ability to tune the focus on a per-lens basis - way cool. The WI-FI function is not very easy to use, and really slow - not something you'll use to download 100+ shots. The focus system is also a huge step up from older rebels, although I would have preferred the center pattern selection to be a tighter grouping - I still find I have to use single center focus point for soccer games. A word about the lens bundled - yes it is silent, I means really silent when focusing - like spooky silent. It does the camcorder focus hunt from time to time (although there are deep menu options with this camera to influence the focus selection criteria (although not as many as the 5D Mark III's...), you'll probably never dig that deep to change them in real time shooting situations.).

Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  . Not sure why canon is trading noise for megapixels.I am very disappointed with the amount of noise at this price pointMoire: It was unbearable in some shots (especially the Ocean shots)LowLight Focus: Even with 50mm/1.4 the camera struggled to get focus of dimly lit subjects.Lemon: After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working. They worked again when I tilted the camera at an angle and this might be because of some loose contact . I am in the process of getting the device replaced as it is still within the return time-frameThe Good:It has everything except a full framesensor.Video AF was excellent. (with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135 lens image stabilization seems to be good. during some video shots I didn't expect the video to be stable but i was surprised to see a decent shot.Pricing was goodConclusion:All the ugly and bad points (except for the lemon part) seems to be been done intentionally by cannon to balance their lineup.I was split between 6D and 70D and ended up buying 70D as I will be using all those bells and whistles than the full-frame. This is just my personal preference. In general Full-Frames are better.Most likely in a year or two we will see a full-frame from cannon having the same 70D features. that is a combination of 6d and 70d (today that is 5d, but expensive for non-professionals)Advice:For Families:if you are looking for a camera to get family photos(events and travel) and are trying to buy DSLR please do your self a favor and  try the mirrorless cameras first (Cannon should be coming out with a new EOS-M soon) . DSLRs come with a lot of baggage. All the beautiful photos that u see online  are not only using DSLR but have considerable stabilizing equipment and do not forget that the photographer has considerable experience.For Hobbyists/Enthusiasts/ Price Conscious:This is a good camera for us till a full-frame with Video-AF is released by Canon.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for", "Author": "D. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3GN4O1D97MGT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.I find myself often grabbing the 70D instead of my 6D (a full-frame model) for casual shooting because my EF-S 18-135mm STM lens gives me a broader zoom range than any EF lens I own, because the camera has a built-in flash, and because the autofocus for video mode works very well.  When I get serious about my pictures I nearly always use my 6D for its better low-light performance, cleaner images, and better control over depth-of-field, but I find myself using my 70D a lot more than I ever thought I would.  It's a great all-around camera.No crop-sensor camera can match a full-frame camera when it comes to overall quality of image, but if your budget doesn't allow you to purchase full-frame, or you're doing wildlife photography (where the focal length multiplier works to your advantage), I wholeheartedly recommend the 70D.  Great image quality, easy to use, super fast in every way.If you're debating between this and a Nikon model, here are the differences... Canons focus quite a bit faster and do a better job with coloring of skin tones.  Nikons have the advantage when it comes to color for landscapes (particularly in the greens), and they have a better flash system.  Nikon tends to put more features into their cameras at a given price point, where Canon focuses more on the tried-and-true, making the cameras easy to use in favor of throwing every bell and whistle in.

Most useful is its ability to autofocus while shooting video.  With my 60D, I had to focus manually, or use autofocus in still-picture mode before switching to video.  I don't shoot much video, but when I do, I like the capabilities of the 70D.I can think of three features that might be improved:1) The camera does three-shot HDR (high dynamic range) by combining three images at different exposures.  But to do this, it is necessary to switch from RAW to JPG output in one camera menu, the enable HDR in another menu.  The camera could do this automatically.  Further, I would like the camera to save one of the three exposures as a RAW or JPG image for me to work with on my computer.2) The camera has more options for choosing autofocus points than I know what to do with.  The 60D was simpler; I could choose any one autofocus point or use all of them merely by turning one dial on the camera.

I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.  I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.  Here are signs you can use if you suspect similar:-The USB cable and neck strap should be sealed in individual plastic bags.  Mine were loose.-The manuals should be sealed.  There should be a CD and several errata and warranty cards loose.  Mine were all loose.-The used camera had the battery fully charged.  The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.  The only way to recover from this was to remove and reseat the battery.-The first camera was set up to shoot RAW.  The default out of the box is typically jpeg.-Images taken with the camera were numbered starting at 2561 instead of 0001.-The date was set on the first camera.

At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.  It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.  Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.

Yes, I bought it direct from Amazon and not from a third party.  I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.  I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.  Here are signs you can use if you suspect similar:-The USB cable and neck strap should be sealed in individual plastic bags.  Mine were loose.-The manuals should be sealed.  There should be a CD and several errata and warranty cards loose.  Mine were all loose.-The used camera had the battery fully charged.  The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.  The only way to recover from this was to remove and reseat the battery.-The first camera was set up to shoot RAW.  The default out of the box is typically jpeg.-Images taken with the camera were numbered starting at 2561 instead of 0001.-The date was set on the first camera.  The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.  At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.  It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.  Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.  My guess is an unscrupulous 70D owner bought a second camera from Amazon and swapped them rather than just sending their camera in for service.

I have been wanting to pull the trigger the last few years when Canon would release successor after successor to the 30D, and finally did it with this one after playing with the touchscreen a bit at a popular electronics store.The 70D is QUICK! It is quick to focus - whether via the viewfinder or liveview, and the menu is quick as well. Traversing the menu via the touchscreen also makes things a lot easier - I have it set to sensitive.  I won't harp on too much about the video autofocusing capabilities since enough has been said about it - but it is awesome.Things that I find myself doing after a month of ownership, that I couldn't do on the 30D:LiveView - manual focusing via liveview, and the ability to zoom in to confirm focus.. holy crap!! My manual lenses give me 100% success rate now in indoor dimlit settings.Wifi - connect to smartphone:  I can now quickly do some in-cam edits on raw captures, transfer a jpg version from the camera to my iPhone, and send it to eager parents/models/whoever I did the shoot for.Sensor-cleaning: Greeted with a 'sensor cleaning' message each time I turn the camera on and off, via \"ultrasonic vibrations\". Regardless of its effectiveness, it makes me feel better ;-)..wish it had:Considering the camera is crazy customizable, I am disappointed that there is no way to assign a shortcut key to preview the image in 100% to maintain my chimping habit.

I was on the fence on whether to get the Nikon D7100 or the Canon 70D and did a lot of online research comparing the two and the consensus is the Canon 70D edges out the Nikon D7100 (check for yourself, please don't just take my word for it).I really liked taking pictures with my G15 and it was very handy.  I bought my Canon 70D at a Black Friday sale at Fry's Electronics.

The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.  I have not tried any of the movie editing capabilities; will report later.  I am using the 18-135m kit lens.Please take the following comments with a grain of salt as I have only had this camera for one week and have only shot ~2500 pics so far.  Interestingly enough the battery still has a charge left after all the pics and a dozen movie clips of some 41sec to 2min duration.  I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.  Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.  I was attending a concert and wanted to alternate between pictures and movie clips.  I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.  I am comparing this to my Lumix FZ200 which takes just as good movies with a dedicated button and has a 600mm f2.8 Leika lens and cost 1/3 the price of the 70D.  That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.  Not only do these allow you to change settings as needed, but this is also an excellent training tool in learning the trade offs and influences on each other when you change the various parameters (aperture, ISO, speed, etc.).As a side note, and not related to the 70D itself,  I also ordered a lens hood and assorted filters [make sure you attach a UV, or other, filter immediately to protect the lens].  The lens hood I received was poor.  Be careful and make sure that the hood you get can be applied together with the lens cap!  This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.  It goes without saying that the hood was not reversible.

This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip. On delivery the box was clearly re-sealed, accessory packaging opened, and other signs of hasty re-packaging evident. Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product. After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly. The response was negative or arrogant to the extreme. As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product. Oh yes, the proof... Come on Amazon, you can train your packaging staff better than that. The included strap was from a 5D, not 70D, and (I now know having bought another) that packaging was missing.

In fact the poor build quality affects the controls, like the rear wheel, it's so cheap plastic that it's difficult to turn.2.Focus: With the kit lens(I have the 18-135mm) is good and accurate, but forget about it if you will use most other lenses. I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view. I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem. I was wondering how canon would release a camera with major defect like this. The dpreview web site noticed the same thing. Read their review. They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon. Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras. Also the canon is sticking to the 30p. No 60p.4.Custumization: poor for a 1K camera. Example: you can not assign the buttons you like. No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony. I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not. The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu. A 4 or 5 steps. Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood. It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject. Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it, after a very long wait", "Author": "Bernard Icore", "ReviewID": "R47GJEELTKHTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the product is what I have order and expected and was not disappointed.

Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling. The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not. Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment). With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL. The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever. Then I tried using FEL with the T3i. There was no difference between using FEL and not using it on my T3i. All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter. I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i. I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant. She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one. Plus, it's hard to get candid shots when an FEL pre-flash is being used.This isn't what I bargained for when I \"upgraded\" my camera body.I'm now wondering if this will negatively effect exposures on outside fill flash photos with a diffuser attached.The fact that Canon hasn't addressed this yet is disconcerting to say the least.

I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens. I also own a Canon PowerShot s95. I am extremely happy with both cameras. Because my wife and I recently had our first born child, I started searching for a low light camera + lens combo that is capable of autofocusing during video, which the s95 cannot.My search brought me to the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 II USM lens combo. I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens. I took some amazing natural light / low light pictures and video of my daughter with the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4.However, I couldn't see myself lugging that thing around everywhere. I can put the s95 in my pocket; can't do that with the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4. The more I thought about it, I realized that the hefty 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 would get in the way of me taking the pictures and video I want to take. Simply put, I upgraded the wrong camera. I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II. I've always been a Canon loyalist. But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet). But I haven't completely abandoned Canon; I also picked up a Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM that I'll use on the Canon Xti body.Bottom line: the 70D is a fantastic camera. But to justify the expense, make sure you're going to use it to its fullest potential.

The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.  My home is reasonably well lit and I was surprised when the flash popped up as I attempted to take a photo of my daughter.  This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.  I also took some video which caused the lens to hunt even though the camera was pointed directly at my daughter and the room was well lit.  When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't. I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.

That day I was taking my family out for dinner and I wanted to bring the camera but I just could not imagine lugging it around and finding room for it on the table.  It started to dawn on me that I might not have been realistic in my selection and that while I would not mind spending money on better glass and maybe even mastering the controls and settings that would get me the photos I wanted, I really need something more portable. Perhaps I need two cameras? One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket. Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
