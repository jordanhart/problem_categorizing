It is cheap plastic, nothing works as expected. Motion detector's sound is hard to hear even when I am right next to it. It is like a silent alarm, really, almost no sound. I didn't want to waste my time by writing a review about this security(!) system but I just want people who might consider buying this item to know that this is absolutely useless for security purposes. Please save your money and don't waste your time. I threw mine right away, I mean everything. It is a big disappointment and I didn't even bother myself to return it. Simply, it is in the trash where it is supposed to be.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good item. no problems and easy set up", "Author": "larryroyc", "ReviewID": "R35F6RTCHU182S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "fast shipping, works great, easy set up. would recommend to anyone looking to beef their curremt security or set up a new one", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1PUZ87YDHYT91", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This thing is a flimsy plastic P.O.S. that works poorly.
