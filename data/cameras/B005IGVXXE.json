When I got the camera, there was no information about this feature, and no cords in the box.  I looked online to see if there was a cord I could purchase, and had no luck.  I finally found Q&A; on the Nikon website that answered my question:\"The F8Z361-NK Dock Connector Cable was only available as a promotional item with the COOLPIX S1200pj for a limited period. It is not available from Nikon as a sales item.\"If the cable is no longer available, then HOW can iPhone compatibility be the 2nd greatest feature of this product?Aside from this disappointment, the camera is easy to use, and the project feature is very cool.Update: The camera broke after 6 months of light use. It makes a terrible noise when you turn it on/off, and the auto-focus stopped working. It is still under the Nikon warranty, but shipping isn't covered, so this little camera keeps costing more and more.

Never having seen a camera/projector previously, I was a little apprehensive about this product.  I worried needlessly as I soon discovered that all of its advertised features performed as promised.  Should have know to second guess NIKON!! This is an extremely handy camera/projector ideal for vacations.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A camera can't do full features due to lacking cable!", "Author": "Y.

Gehret \"G-Man  Colorado\"", "ReviewID": "RS8AYPPCOTR3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon hit another one out of the park with this final model, the S1200pj digital projector camera.  I really like the S1000pj with its nicely built, solid construction and features. The second in this series is the S1100pj which offered touch screen functions, But the S1200pj offers a larger 3\" screen, quick movie botton (rear) and two additional features that are important : The fill movie light (that throws a\"fill light\" on subjects as well as improved low-light conditions). The other, is the wind reduction setting when outdoor..and EZ projector activation by simply sliding the dust cover in front.I read a lot of reviews regarding this model and their unfair comments..(regarding Nikon not including the cable for iphones  .However,  one can connect the camera to a laptop however, newer PC's have HDMI, via  HDTV) .  So ratings took a beating when Nikon decided to end the cables for Iphones.  What they missed was the unique useful camera. Nikon improved the projector on this particular model by installing DLP technology which projects 20 lumens and longer battery life, (less power required for projecting images or movies). If you can get this camera at the right price and by an authorized Nikon dealer, this will come with a 90 day warranty from defects. I gladly give this model a 5 Star due to the many impressive improvements as well as print quality and video improvements as well .  Nikon did a good job with their final release of the projector digital camera/video compact camera. Lastly..Some have complained that pictures are out of focus. I have learned that by changing the setting to Scene Mode, the system works faster, sharper imaging and great photos. User's need to try different settings first, before making misleading reviews. The camera is great for video projections and in group gatherings .  Job well done Nikon !", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera and projector", "Author": "Tester 90", "ReviewID": "R3PKF0V22KG6X0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is fine, I didn't really even buy this camera to use as a camera. I bought it to use as a projector, which is GREAT...IF you have a dark room and a white wall. And honestly even in somewhat lighted rooms I can still see the projections just fine.My camera came with the cords that work great with my iPod touch. It's easy to setup and use.The only real problem I have is the volume...it's not really loud. If you watch a movie by yourself and its in a quiet room, then you might be able to hear everything...but if you are trying to project a movie you bought from iTunes for a room of people...GOOD LUCK!If anyone knows of something you can hook up and/or use to make the camera louder, or an adapter for some speakers; PLEASE let me know.That being said, the camera is great for a all around pocket camera/point and shoot. Also it's great as a projector. For viewing photos and movies, etc...but the sound is not up to par with the rest of this camera/projector.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon coolpix S1200pj projection camera", "Author": "D.F.", "ReviewID": "R2IVPYZVRZ7OK2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this camera so far, still getting to know all the features of this camera, picture quality is great, also using the camera is simple, when i finish taking pictures, the fact that i can project the pictures on a wall for all to see is when the real fun start. i definitely will recommend this camera to all.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not my favorite camera", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "R21RCTJ4PRP6F0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a very convenient size for travel but I am not necessarily impressed wit the quality that I get.
