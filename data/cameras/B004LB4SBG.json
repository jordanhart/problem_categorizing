{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review along with Tips for your new GE x500", "Author": "PG", "ReviewID": "R3B6IU8RZAPIXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "REVIEW: My last two digital cameras have been point & shoot Kodak's and it took so long for the camera to reset in between pictures I was missing shot after shot.  Plus, the Kodak's didn't have any kind of picture stabilization so half the pictures came out blurry. With that said, I was in the market for a different brand of camera.I was considering the Nikon L120 but really didn't want to shell out that kind of money so I kept putting the purchase off.  Then I came across this GE x500 with its list of equally good features, great reviews and incredible price.  I didn't even know GE made cameras so I have to say I was a bit leery about how good it would be compared to SLR style cameras with name recognition but I went for it and it has ended up being the perfect camera for my picture taking needs (vacations, special occasions, holidays, parties, pets, occasional on line classified ad or auction).TIPS: I haven't had the camera that long and with all the features, figuring it out can be a little intimidating but I've played around with it enough to discover the setting I found easiest for starting out and I wanted to pass it on.  When you turn the camera on for the first time it will lead you through the language and date set. (Super easy to do.) Once that's set up if you turn the wheel on the top of the camera to SCN, 20 little icons will show up along the bottom of the LCD screen. As you scroll through the icons it gives you a description of what each one is for.  Some of the icon modes include: Sport (for fast moving objects), Beach (for strong sunlight), Fireworks (bright images against night sky), Glass (for shooting images behind glass), Sunset, Snow, Indoor, Portraits, Landscape, plus several more including a few special affect modes. When you choose the icon/mode for your situation the camera automatically sets itself to take the best picture in that circumstance. Last night I took pictures in the house with the flash on and using the Indoor mode and I couldn't believe how crystal clear they came out. I was also able to take one picture right after the other (unlike my Kodak)! I'm very pleased and can't wait to discover what else can be done with this camera.WHAT YOU'LL NEED: You should also know you will need an SDHC Card since the camera only has internal room for 3 images. I bought the Transcend 8GB, Class 10 for $13.00 here on Amazon and it works perfectly even without formatting. The Class 6 would probably work as well if you want to save a few bucks although they are currently the same price...go figure. (The Class determines the speed in between shots, the higher the class the faster.) I also recommend the SMALL Zeikos Camera Bag available on Amazon for $5.00. (The Medium would be too big.) It's padded and the perfect size for this camera plus a few essentials like extra batteries, cleaning cloth, cables, etc.  I actually put my Flip Video Camera in the bag too.) Next, I recommend the Duracell Value Charger if you don't already have one. It comes with 4 pre charged Nimh batteries for around $13 on Amazon. You'll have all the accessories you need after these purchases. On a side note, I went ahead and paid the $10 extra to get this camera in white and it was worth it.  Love the look over basic black.CONS:  I was super disappointed that it came with a CD instead of a paper Users Manual but I printed out the pages I thought I'd refer to most (but that doesn't help if I need instructions on another feature and I don't have a computer and the CD on me. I would have preferred a small instruction book that fit in my case. It creates a .thm file (thumbnail) for every picture you download to your computer. The only purpose for this file is for viewing your pictures while IN YOUR CAMERA. It is not needed once you transfer pics to your computer so it can be deleted once transferred but it's a bit of a pain. It's a small file and barely takes up any computer memory but I don't like computer clutter so it bugs me. I think it should have come with a screen/lens cleaning cloth (no biggie, just sayin).SUMMARY: Well, that's it. If you're in the market for an SLR style camera I really don't think you can go wrong with this one if you're an amateur photographer who wants to take better than average pictures (and as long as keep in mind that although it does have some point and shoot features it is an SLR which means you'll have some figuring out to do to take full advantage of those professional photography shots) You should also keep in mind that this is a nice camera for the money not a $500 - $800 camera that a professional photographer would use for his business.UPDATE: Even though the Duracell battery's charge is *impressively long* while in the camera, you might want to consider purchasing an extra set of (4) Nimh batteries so you always have a set of freshly charged batteries in the charger.  That way you can just switch them out without having to wait 6 hours to recharge each time. Lastly, I found another handy feature using the camera wheel on top of the camera.  If you set it on ASCN the picture taking conditions are detected and the most suitable settings will automatically be selected without any manual adjustments. This feature is similar to the other one I mentioned (SCN) but with this one the camera automatically selects for you. It's also similar to the \"auto\" setting (the camera symbol on the wheel) but it makes more adjustments for you than just one preset \"auto\" mode. (For instance, when on the ASCN setting it knows when you're taking a close up and adjusts itself accordingly.) I know the look of the camera probably isn't a very big determining factor when purchasing but I have yet to pull this camera out without someone saying, wow, nice camera.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great starter camera if you want better pics than a point and shoot.", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "RH0M60PPKZB67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many other reviewers I am not a professional photographer, and this is my first digital camera. I do like taking pictures though and I've dealt with a few nice film cameras and some nice Fujifilm cameras (a P&S;, 'bridge camera' and a DSLR) and I feel like this camera is most definitely worth the price. The X500 is a bridge camera, almost a SLR and almost a point and shoot. But it boasts some great specs and features that you cannot find anywhere in this price range.Pros. The 16 megapixel sensor is great. Most entry level cameras of any type and brand start off at about 12 MP right now. GE has this model at 16. I think the other 16 MP cameras are over twice the price of this one. You can see the difference when you zoom in on your computer, the clarity is apparent.The zoom on the X500 is awesome. This camera has 15X optical zoom and along with digital zoom (digital zoom takes away image quality as you zoom in so just keep that in mind when using it) it has a total of 60X zoom.The X500 has a panoramic mode which I love because I wanted a panoramic film camera and now I don't have to buy one. This camera also has a setting for everything from fireworks to snow to fisheye. More than just night and outdoors.. there are 20 different presets and thats not including the different modes the camera has for shooting (it has manual, very important!)So far I've taken 100+ pictures and the battery is still full on the display. The manual says it'll shoot 300+ pictures on a set of 4 batteries... thats pretty good.Not a pro for some, but this camera is a bit hefty. I like it because its like you are actually holding onto something. But it is heavier than I thought it would be.Viewfinders are sometimes left out of cameras now because they all have screens, but this one has an electronic viewfinder (for those sunny days) I think thats a nice perk.The video quality is better than I expected, though its not HD. The sound is so-so but thats the case on everything with a recorder.Cons. The screen resolution and quality isn't the greatest (I have a 3 year old Creative mp3 player that has a much nicer screen and it's smaller.) Like most cameras though you look at the screen and its grainy and the color doesn't look quite right but you snap the picture/ upload and it looks like it should when its on the computer screen (or printed out.) I think they had to cut corners somewhere.The lens pops out when you turn it on and the lens cap pops off, even if you just want to look at the pictures on your SD. And I also do not like the lens cap. It just slides on. No clips.The sound effects were annoying, but theres a setting to turn it off (saves your battery anyway.)Not a biggie but the SD slot is in the battery compartment. Just out of the way I guess.The camera is a bit noisy, you can hear the processor working and the internal stuff moving around at times. More of a side note than a con though.Bottom line is I'm not sure how long the X500 will last (because I got it in the mail two days ago) but so far I'm very glad that I bought this camera. It's a lot like Fuji's bridge camera and if you know the menus and buttons from their cameras then this thing will be a snap because its pretty much a carbon copy. The layout is simple enough for a beginner or teen who's looking into photography and it wont break the bank like a nikon or canon with the same specs.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Bridge Camera ^-^", "Author": "exProphecy", "ReviewID": "R1BFZ4QVYUD13J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most people who are purchasing this camera, I have little or no experience in photography. Although I've dabbled in the arts of Skype and quick pics using my phone, this GE bridge camera is hardly in the same tier. So many features.. so little time..Pros:> Superb picture quality for the price> Myriad of features packed in one> Super ZOOM to the rescue!> Build quality feels legit (ergo, a real, solid camera rather than a cheap toy)I'll go more in depth with the features. My favorite feature is the HDR conversion of photos. After you take a photo, you go to the photo you just took by hitting the > (play) button. Then hit menu and go all the way down. There's an option called \"HDR\" which converts your photo to \"High Dynamic Range\" quality. Simply put, it enhances the colors of the photo, making it brighter and more vivid. Another great feature is smile detection. Press the little smiling button right next to the \"waving hand\" (that's image stabilization which I always have on =]). If you press it once, it will be in face detection mode. Press it twice and you'll see a smiling face on your digital screen instead. Now, press the shutter button and you'll notice it won't actually take any pictures.. until someone smiles! =D My other favorite feature is the panorama mode, of course! I honestly imagined taking panorama photos to be much more arduous but it's quite simple. You start your photo from the left then you just move your camera to the right while lining up the crosses on the screen! Those are my favorite features so far but there are much, much more I personally haven't played with such as manual mode (more for experts where they set aperture and shutter priority).Cons:> Probably the worst problem this camera has are the picture quality of photos taken inside. (Don't worry, the pros outweigh this problem by far)> \"HD\" quality videos don't really seem very \"HD\"> Wish it came with a camera bag (not really a big deal since I bought one separately but it would've been nice?/ kinda looking for more cons since it's a bit hard xD)> Not really a con, but more of an improvement suggestion.. Maybe for smile detection, instead of having the need to press the shutter button THEN the camera will take the picture, it could be set up so that when smile detection is enabled, the camera automatically takes pictures when they smile. Also, it could be done so endlessly (meaning it takes pictures of people that smile multiple times, over and over).All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. An excellent bridge camera (an in-between point and shoot and DSLR camera) for $140 (which I believe is the most inexpensive bridge camera of this quality out there) is a great buy!Oh on a side note, if you're thinking of purchasing the white version, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the white on this camera. I didn't want it to look just like EVERY other camera out there so I got the white so it could kind of \"pop-out.\" Definitely pops out and is pretty noticeable! =]Also, I uploaded some photos for you folks interested in purchasing this product. I demonstrated a little preview of the Panorama mode and HDR setting for you =D", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad...but not great, either", "Author": "GiveItYourBest", "ReviewID": "R1XMKD5BCGQ8QR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had purchased this specifically because I was doing a lot of hiking during an extended trip, and I wanted more than the 4x zoom on my cheap Nikon Coolpix S4000.  Since at home my wife has a very nice DSLR with multiple lenses, I didn't want to buy a another DSLR or spend a lot of money on a nicer bridge camera.  The previous version of this camera got good reviews, so bought this one just after it had came out.Out of the box, the camera seems pretty solid, although the compact (but FAT) build is a little weird and takes some getting used to.  I initially did a comparison to my $130 12MP Coolpix point-and-shoot, and immediately saw some issues with the photo quality.  Like other reviews have stated, indoor pictures are not great, but actually not as bad as some.  My Coolpix (like most point and shoot cameras) had some problems as well, but the quality was still noticeably better than the GE.  When using the indoor program mode, the shots were acceptable.  The outdoor shots were better, but not super great, either.  Comparing the same shots with my Coolpix, the Nikon had consistently better pictures.While for most this wouldn't be too much of a problem, when viewing the photos and zooming in past 100%, there is significant pixel noise on the GE.  Again, comparing to my 12MP Coolpix, the same shot at the same zoom had significantly less noise on my Nikon than the GE.  Overall, the biggest problem was the inconsistency of the photos.  Even using the same settings only a few seconds apart, there were often differences in the exposure, balance, etc.  My hundreds of outdoor shots were all over the place in terms of quality.  The shots often had a washed-out appearance (which could be fixed in post-processing if necessary).I took the GE on several hiking trips, and took hundreds of photos, using different program modes and settings, which improved the quality overall, but did not eliminate the inconsistency issue.  The zoom was quick and the image stabilization worked very well.  The battery life was excellent (although I did not use the flash too much).  The focus is moderately quick compared to most point and shoot cameras, although slower than my Nikon.  The video mode was poor, but that was expected.  I also used the GE in a couple of museums, and using the Museum program mode, it took surprisingly good shots.  I also toured an indoor wildlife museum, and using the flash it took some very fine pictures.Unfortunately, after viewing all of the pictures, I decided to return the camera.  I don't necessarily want to talk anyone out of buying this...for most casual users, this camera can take good shots, and the 15x zoom is awesome at this price.  For still pictures, outdoor and lit indoor shots, the photo quality is fine (especially using the program modes or manual controls).  To get this level of control and zoom, you're going to be paying over $200 for something else, and probably over $300 for anything really significantly better.  However, as I often print my photos for framing, the inconsistent quality and extreme noise, even compared to my cheap Nikon, left me wanting a bit more.PROS-- 15x zoom works very well- Many different program modes and manual controls, which work well- Great battery life and uses easy-to-get AA batteries- Photo quality can be fairly good under right conditions, and most issues could be fixed with post-processing (i.e. Photoshop, etc.)- Inexpensive for a good zoom and feature packed cameraCONS-- Lots of noise when zoomed in (pixel peeking)- Inconsistent picture quality", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "High value camera", "Author": "V. CHAN", "ReviewID": "R3DC0RU6E66U36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The built-in cameras in cell phones and ipads are getting better and better so I thought getting a point and shoot camera may be redundant.  An entry level SLR camera will cost $400 or more so I took a chance on this \"bridge\" camera which is a step up from a point and shoot but a step down from an SLR camera.The more I use this bridge camera, the more I like it.  I always preferred Canon cameras but this GE camera is even better. The photos and movies are sharp in bright light.  In low light, the Canon still has a edge but only in the automatic mode.  Here are my top ten favorite features:1.  15X optical plus 4X digital for 60X total zoom.  There is an indicator which let you know that you have gone past the 15X optical zoom and into the digital zoom since digital zoom will compromise quality.  I only use the 60X zoom for my movies and my movies are impressive when you can zoom 60X.2. The menus are extremely intuitive and very easy to use.  For example:  There is an SLR-like top dial to switch from automatic to the following settings:  program AE, shutter priority, aperture priority, manual, portrait, panoramic, movie, 20 scene mode, automatic scene mode.  Turning the top dial is superior to scrolling thru a menu maze on the camera screen.  One turn and you are done!3. The flash pops up and away from the lens which minimizes red eye.  The flash also has a red eye reduction mode.  If you forget to use the red eye reduction mode flash, the camera can even remove the red eye after the photo is taken.4. There is a dedicated button to switch from the LCD screen to the viewfinder.  A viewfinder is a must-have for taking photos in bright sunlight which can render the LCD screen useless.  The viewfinder displays all of the menus as the LCD screen so you are in full control.5. There are dedicated buttons for anti-shake (stabilization) mode and smile and face detection mode.  The anti blink mode is also great which prevent a photo from being taken when someone blinks.  The smile mode to release the shutter automatically is nice.  The timer is also very user friendly.6.  I took an indoor macro photo of a full page magazine article and a newpaper and the photo clarity was so good that I can easily read the text on my PC.  You should take 1 full second to hold the camera steady while \"slowly\" depressing the camera shutter.  This allows the camera sufficient time to focus and setup correctly.7.  I love the panoramic option which allows you to stitch three photos into one panoramic photo.  The camera automatic release the shutter when the scene is aligned with the previous photo and the results are perfect.  I can't wait to take panoramic photos of whereever I go now since it is so easy to do and the resulting panoramic photos are seamless.8. Other features include:  (1) 7 settings for white balance;  (2) Exposure compensation settings from +2.0 to -2.0;  (3) Four color modes of auto, vivid, black&white;, sepia; (4) Two auto focus modes of single and multi; (5) Three auto exposure modes of spot, center, AiAE;  (6) Automatic scene mode or you can manually set the scene mode with 20 scenes, such as fireworks, sports, sunset, beach, snow, etc, etc.9.  Since changing the settings are so easy to do quickly...this camera allows me to use the advance settings whenever I can.  It is so easy that I can't help thinking whether Steve Jobs may have designed how a user will access the advance settings on this camera.  My former canon had some advance features but it was so difficult to set up the camera that I ended up not using them.10. Uses 4 AA batteries which I prefer.  My last point and shoot camera was a Canon which uses only 2 AA batteries but my Canon drain down the two AA batteries very quickly.  This camera has an auto shutdown feature which you can set the time to shutdown.The negatives are:1. Bigger and heavier that a point and shoot camera.  However, it is slightly lighter than a SLR camera...especially with the zoom lens which is quite heavy on a SLR camera.2. No camera case.  There is a lens cap to protect the lens but there is no protection for the LCD screen.3. The strap looks cheap.  It works but I will probably replace it.4. Some sections of the manual are poorly written.  I figured it out the instructions after playing with it for a day with no thanks to the manual.5. Automatic mode in low light does not measure up to my Canon.  However, I can set the camera to the indoor scene mode or using the AE program setting and then adjusting the exposure compensate feature.  These extra steps will result in a low light photo that is better than my Cannon.  The negative is that you do have to set it up properly.6.  There is no flash adjustment (to lessen or strengthen the flash output) and no hotshoe for a flash add-on.  This is expected for a camera in this price range but I really wish I had this feature.My photos are much improved because I spend the few extra seconds to switch to the right mode to compensate for the scene, lighting and focus.  If I don't have the time, the camera has the automatic mode which works well in bright light.  I still can't believe that I only paid $130 for a 16.0 megapixel camera from GE with this many features.I highly recommend it since the quality and features blows away any point and shoot camera in this price range.  If you do not have the 3 to 6 seconds to set it up properly, which you will need for a typical SLR camera, then you need a simple point and shoot camera which means you are compromising some quality for convenience.  The extra 3 to 6 seconds will make a big difference in the quality of the photo and this bridge camera allows you to do this very easily.Dec 2011 Update:  I found out that this camera will take underexposed photos in certain low light conditions but I have since learned to make the adjustment for this weakness.  For example: I discovered that \"Program AE\" mode works well for an indoor low light after you adjust the exposure compensation and making sure the white balance is correct.  I then take 2 shots with the flash and without the flash and then compare the two photos.  The main point is that this is a great camera for a beginner to learn how the advance settings work.  Potential buyers must take the time to experiment and learn the strengths and weaknesses.  You should not expect this camera to compenstate for beginners and a point and shoot camera is designed to do just that. Now that I have increased my photographic knowledge with this bridge camera, my next camera will be an expensive SLR camera after enjoying this bridge camera for a few years.  At this price point I don't see how anyone can complain except when the user take the disappointing photos in certain low light conditions and user did not progress to learn how to compenstate.  I suspect some of the negative reviews involved people who did not experiment with the different settings and then took photos in the wrong settings and prematurely concluded this is a bad camera.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA !!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY !!", "Author": "Pratz", "ReviewID": "R519DDJLV0QU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got to know about this camera by chance. I have a 7.2 MP Casio camera which is very good but since my cousin would be visiting me I wanted a new, high MP and Zoom camera for  summer. I first looked at a Casio Model. It was good but not what I wanted. After checking many cameras Fuji, Nikon, Sony etc...I just lost hope. I saw a 16 MP Canon SLR camera and was amazed that there are 16 MP cameras now. So I typed 16 MP in the Amazon search box just to check out the newer models. And bingo !! This camera showed up first in the search. And when I looked at the price , it almost blew me away. I had never heard of GE making cameras before and was very very hesitant. Then I read the REVIEWS, saw videos on YOUTUBE, sent MESSAGES to the owners of this camera, read scores of other reviews and ALMOST ALL OF THEM GAVE THIS CAMERA 5 STARS. I was pretty impressed and then decided to buy it. And let me tell you it took absolutely STUNNING pictures.I also showed this camera to one of my friends who knows a lot about cameras and stuff and he was surprised and said that its actually a good camera, and so many features for lesser price. I am still learning how to use it and so far I like it.....Manual settings give you more advanced controls.1. Took a shot at full 15X zoom, came crystal clear.2. Image stabilization is good.3. Lots of scenic modes4. Very easy and accessible features.PS: WHITE COLOUR is freakin' awesome on this camera. Go for it. Plenty of look-alike black cameras out there.TIP: If you want batteries to last longer, then after using the camera just take them out.Check out the pictures I put on the page. They are awesome !!Check these reviews on About.com.[...]", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "More than I expected", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer1", "ReviewID": "R15TT061TKS68S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am simply amazed at all the features of this camera. For $155 I got the camera, 8GB SDHC Memory Card(SanDisk is the recommended brand)and a small Zeikos Case which is waterproof/shock resistant.  This is the perfect size for travel.Background on why I selected this camera:I am going to be living abroad for a few months on an internship and I wanted a compact camera with powerful Optical Zoom and Megapixles. I read reviews and countless buying guides. I originally bought the Vivtar T328 but as soon as I got it the touch screen stopped working so I returned it.Just by chance I came upon this GE X500 model. It is built on a Fuji  S series camera(it really looks and feels like a Fuji) for a fraction of the cost. Don't let the GE/General Imaging brand name fool you. The founders of General Imagining retired from Minolta(which is now Sony) and Fuji. This goes to show you that they mean business for this price point.Professional Features:I like to be able to take photos in automatic modes for when I don't have time to plan my photo shoot. But when I have a day to film the big airplanes landing at San Francisco International Airport then I like to be able to set the manual modes.This camera allows me to set aperture and Shutter Priority as well as manual White Balance. I also like being able to set the ISO Settings.Furthermore I love the 27mm wide angle zoom with 15x Optical Zoom. Having only 5x of Digital Zoom says a lot of how professional this camera is. The more optical zoom you can get the better. I tried taking photos and let me tell you they turn out to be so professional just like the expensive Canons.I also like the different scene modes, portrait, panorama, Optical Image Stabilization and both an electronic viewfinder and an LCD screen with automatic brightness control. I like that you can see the menu functions in the Electronic View Finder.The ArcSoft looks like a good software and I will test that out. I recommend that you try it out before going on to the more advanced Adobe Photoshop.  Be creative.In addition I like that I can record movies while I don't need an HD recorder as I have a camcorder its a nice way to record short films of the photos I took. This does not replace your separate camcorder. For avid videographers stick to a movie camera. A lot of the time people want high quality video from an all in one camera.  As long as I can use the optical zoom for shooting video that is enough.I also like that the camera comes with a decent strap/lens cap.  I highly recommend that you buy an 8GB SDHC San Disk Class 4+ Memory Card, Zeikos small carrying case as well as 4 AA rechargeable batters with a charger.I would much rather have AA Batteries over a rechargeable Lion battery as after that goes you have to spend $50+ for a new one.Setup:Setup was easy. I first turned on the camera and set the date and time. Having the World Time feature with a home and travel setting was another important feature that I want.After setting up the date please don't forget to format the SD Card and do this everytime you download the photos to your computer or get a new SD Card as it will optimize the saving to the card.If you need more space on the card lower the resolution to 10 Megapixles.Overall I cannot believe the quality and the price of this camera. When I saw the Fuji S camera today  and tested it out I was amazed at how the GE Camera is so similar for the fraction of the cost. The Fuji Camera was $270 vs $155 for everything.Who is this camera good for:This Bridge Camera is good for those who don't want the extra weight of the DSLR and its interchangeable lenses. With airlines charging a lot for extra baggage this camera can be the 2nd included carry on item as you are allowed one backpack and one personal item.If you want the professional features of a DSLR with the ease of a Point and Shoot Camera this is your best choice.For a novice who wants the manual functions this camera is good for you too. Don't spend the $100 now for a basic point and shoot buy this bridge camera and you will be happy for years to come. Its light and durable.Happy Shooting(:", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best camera for the money", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R2X3A0QBM4IO26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for six months. Photography has been my hobby for 30 years.  I have had many, many cameras both film and digital and this GE camera is by far the best.  Most importantly it has a superior zoom lens that gives crystal clear pictures at any focal length. Second it has a digital view finder that that takes away any guess work when taking a picture in a bright light.  The features are outstanding - too many to detail each one - but the ones I use frequently and have exceeded by far my expectations are the museum, sunset, and face recognition features.  The only negative is that because the camera takes four  AA batteries it is a little heavy.

My thought was, if they can do a good job with the big stuff like CAT scanners and ultrasonography equipment, then they should probably be able to do a good job with the small stuff like a camera, and they most certainly did!I must say that I was very pleased with the image quality of this camera!! I like the fact that the camera produces clean, high quality images with vibrant color and no annoying 'shake' that can oftentimes happen with a smaller point-and-shoot. It's lightweight but very sturdy, and can easily slip into a backpack or travel bag (unlike some of the digital SLR's that require an entourage to carry the body and telephoto lenses). I posted a few pictures that I took while on a hiking trip as part of the photo mosaic for this review (above) and must say that I was so very pleased at the picture quality and clarity.And the cost! Full disclosure, I bought mine at a \"brick and mortar\" store (in my case, Sears) for a cheaper price than offered here on Amazon.com. But for under $150.00 this camera is a bargain!! Another thing that I love about this camera is that it takes four AA batteries, but if you want to save some money on your batteries you can easily use rechargeables!! For some odd reason I found that Energizer's rechargeables work much better in this camera than Rayovac's, but you may find your experience to be different.This camera is probably not going to satisfy those who insist on Canon or Leica or Nikon performance (and at $150 I don't think you can honestly expect that)...but for those of us that simply want a good camera with a powerful optical zoom at a great price, this is a wonderful option!!

I have to say this little thing surprised me. I bought it for my girlfriend as a anniversary present as she loves photography and she wanted me to teach her. I didn't want to spend to much in case she changes her mind but I still wanted to get her something that had all the settings and features that she would need to learn. The camera is slightly slow though I'm used to a big nice DSLR so anything that isn't a DSLR is slow to me. There is a slight delay when the shutter is pressed but not as bad as some P&S;(point and shoots) I have used and once you get used to it you wont notice it. It takes the camera a second to get back to the screen to take another picture but a lot quicker then I expected as most P&S; take a few seconds to save the photo and get ready to take another picture. The image quality is actually pretty good though at higher ISO's like 800+ it starts to get a airbrushed look from the noise reduction that is used in the camera but still it does get rid of the noise. Also at ISO 1600 and 3200 it lowers the megapixels to 4mp so don't use those unless you have too. The images are surprisingly sharp for a cheap P&S; like this the colors it produces are nice too. It has a lot of nice scene modes which seem to work pretty good. The panorama feature is great and does a great job of helping you line of the next photo. So in short the cameras is slightly slow but better than other P&S; other there. It's produces nice images with good color. ISO 1600 and 3200 are useless and should only be used if you need to get that one picture that you can't get any other way. Has a lot of nice features that you wont find in a lot of the cameras at a similar price. I recommend this to Anybody that is looking to get started in photography and needs that first camera or is just looking for a nice Cheap P&S; with good zoom to have for vacations and family photos. I do not recommend this to a serious photographer that is looking for something that they can leave their DSLR at home for.P.S. The white one is beautiful doesn't have that ugly texture all over it like the Black one does. I have a GE X5 myself that I keep in my car in case I see something I really need to get a photo of and don't have my DSLR gear with me and it has that ugly texture on it and I hate it.

However, after doing much research, I decided a \"bridge\" camera was more along the lines of what I actually needed. A \"bridge\" camera, simply put, is a camera that is a level or so above a typical point-and-shoot camera, but not at the level of a DSLR.Mainly, I was looking for something that took regular AA or NiMH batteries, something that had 10X (optical) zoom or better- (this has 15X), has optical image stabilization as I have developed a slight-to-noticeable tremor in my hands these past few years, has a good number of megapixels, and could do decent video, and well, help make my photos look better. Also, I wanted something that would give me a sampling of what a DSLR camera offers and provide the opportunity to learn more from pretty basic techniques to some of the finer points of photography as I go along-- this does all that and much more. It has so many settings and variables of it that allow me to experiment with different settings manually, but also has the \"Auto\" setting that allows the camera to sense the environment and automatically adjust it's own settings accordingly, giving me great pictures when I don't want to have to think too much about it.I bought this camera over a year ago, and was sure at that time I would have mastered/outgrown it and moved onto a DSLR by now. However, I am so pleased with this camera, and the great photos it produces, that my DSLR envy has faded quite alot.

The main zoom function of ANY camera is the actual (mm) that the zoom will focus and give you a sharp photo. once you add the OPTICAL zoom to the DIGITAL zoom it's basically like taking a magnifying  glass and putting it in front of your camera.....you only get a \"reflection or magnification\" of the zoom....which IS NOT an actual zoom but a magnification.

Some people may not like the heaviness of it but I do like it.2. The looks- The Ge X500 is a very pretty camera. It just might be to me though.3. The zoom- The zoom on this thing is awesome for the price.4. The veiw finder- Every body knows this but I am going to state it again, not many cameras anymore have veiw finders. I love it for those sunny sunny days!5. Buttons- I love the lay out of the buttons. It is just so intuitive.Cons-1. The focus- The focus on the cam is not that good. You must give it time or you end up with a blurry pic.2. Slowness- This camera is not fast at all! You have to wait a little time (or alot) before taking another pic. Was I expecting it to be lightning fast? No. Was I expecting it to be faster. Yes. Was I expecting too much? Probably!!3. Video- I know, this is not a video camera or anything but I was expecting a little more quality sound. Again, expecting too much? Probably!!All in all, this is a pretty neat little thing. This is no slr or anything. This is a brige camera a.k.a. point and shoot on steroids. Again, I may or may not update.(only God knows!!!!)Update- I did not realize how painfully slow this is! I am sure I have to play with it more, but it is really slow. I do not know if I am being dramatic or what? Like I said, it is a average cam, one must play with it and make it work I guess.Update- I took a bunch of pics at my Uncles wedding. It did good on most everything except the battery life.

It is perfect for beginners (including me) though I may eventually sell my GE X500 to step up to something of much more quality, and a higher priced. No, this isn't for professionals but is perfect for those experimenting with photography and who enjoy it as a hobby. It is very useful!PROS:- Wonderful picture quality and many different options to choose from.- Easy navigation.- Simple to use and great for anyone who wants a great camera for a low price.- High quality. This isn't one of those cheap cameras that breaks after the first use--it holds up. I've banged it a few times, and it's okay. And the lens responds if your hand (or an object) is in the way when you are trying to zoom or when it's turning on. It won't fall apart.- Professional. I think this camera is perfect for a budding professional photographer, since it really gives you the real, basic feel of photography with a realistic camera that you would be using in professional photo shoots and etc.- Shape. The shape of it is like many professional cameras, and I love it. It's so much easier to hold!CONS:- Sometimes it bugs me because it seems slightly slow with turning on, and slightly slow right after you take a picture. IS this a major issue? No. Not at all. In fact, it's very rare that it actual upsets me. It doesn't take a long time, I just have zero patience... so i can't wait more than a few miliseconds!- Not the best for indoor photography. I mainly use it for outdoor, but when I try indoor photos the lighting needs to be good. But it does have a flash, so i guess I shouldn't complain. But flash doesn't help when you're trying to photograph animals!- I guess I could complain that the manual is on a CD or something of the sort... but you don't really need it.CONCLUSION:Worthwhile camera. Buy it, because I promise you won't find anything else this good for in or around the same price!RECOMMENDATIONS:When I bought this I also purchased a Transcend 10GB SDHD card, which works fine with the camera.

I settled for this camera based on several reviews by both professional photographers and amateur users. The camera is a very good camera. The initial pictures were not as crisp as my previous camera but the more I got to understand this camera, the better did the quality of the pictures improve. The three things I quickly learnt were:1.This is a slow camera, if you are very patient with it, your picture qualities will improve. 2. When you focus on an object and you press on the shutter release button gently half way down, be patient for the broken square to turn green before fully depressing the shutter release button. 3.If you understand when to use the different scene modes, then you have close to a professional grade camera in your hands. The camera is excellent for low light scenes. I have not yet used the flash to snap any picture and all the pictures I have taken at night have been superb! I like the panorama and pencil sketch modes. Did I forget to mention the zoom lens of x15 for this price. The color reproduction is impressive.

This camera is easy to use and allows complete control over a shot, but also has a very comprehensive and easy-to-use auto mode. It allows you to adjust just about every aspect of how the picture is shot or for beginners like me it does it for you by selecting which mode you want to use. The LCD screen is a bit grainy but once the picture is shot, it clears up and makes a beautiful picture. The shake control is sort of hit and miss but did help alot once I learned the correct way to hold the camera. The zoom is fantastic! I was able to get some great moon shots. I've been using it pretty much constantly since I got it and over all I'm very pleased with it. Only complaint....battery life kinda sucks. I've gone threw 3, 4 packs of batteries since I got it at the beginning of Feburary.

On one hand the price was so great and the specs so much better than cameras that were more expensive, on the other there were enough negative reviews to make me wonder.  But I thought, what the heck?  The price is so good, it's worth a shot.  If it's a piece of crap I'll return it.  And so far I'm glad I did try it.  I've had it for several months now and even took a photography class with it.  To my great surprise it stood up very well to the far more expensive, larger, bulkier and harder to use DSLRs that the other participants had, particularly in the numbers listed for the zoom feature.  The lens is marked as 15x wide aspheric ED lens 4.9-73.5 mm 1:3.0-5.2 and 27 - 405 mm.  When I read that off in class even the instructor's jaw dropped.  None of the DSLRs with their huge removable lenses got close to that 405 mm.  It also had a lot more settings in SCN mode, like fireworks or sunsets or behind glass or a fisheye effect.  Now regarding the problem other reviews listed, the file that comes out blank.  In fact it's not blank.  It happened to me on the manual setting only.  When I looked in the owner's manual for whether I might be doing something wrong, I found instructions for adjusting the white balance in manual.  After following the instructions the white balance decreased and the image came out fine.Now for a few cons.  The image stabilization/hand shake feature doesn't solve all problems.  Some of my pics came out blurry when I thought I was keeping the camera fairly still.  I did recently acquire a tripod so I'm hoping to solve that issue.  Also it doesn't seem to automatically engage the image stabilization.  The images also can start to get a little blurry toward the edges.  Maybe that's user error, who knows?  I was disappointed in the night feature, pics come out very blurry and the color distorts.  However, using manual or program and adjusting the settings myself seemed to solve some of that.  Making adjustments to exposure value, ISO, shutter speeds is easy and the range is surprisingly good for a product so cheap.  F-stops go from 3.0 to 6.6 or higher, depending on your other settings, EV is 2.0 to-2.0, on shutter priority you can go from 30 (has a snowflake) to 1/2000 (has a bird flying).  ISO goes from 80 to 3200, or leave it on automatic.  Sometimes the image will become increasingly grainy the further I zoom in, but that could be again the stabilization not being on.In the photo class our instructor was joking about the best camera you can get actually is your phone, especially if it has HDR capabilities because the colors are truer to what you are seeing with your eyes. Imagine my surprise at finding a HDR setting on this camera!  Though apparently only after you've taken the shot, since it's on the playback menu.  It does seem to correct the exposure, though not always as much as I wish.  Also a good feature that it took some time to discover is the color setting.  You can change it from auto to vivid color, which gets much closer to what your eyes are looking at.It does go through batteries like crazy, but that can be reduced dramatically by turning off the LCD screen and the flash which are the biggest drains on power.  One thing that had me stumped is the two files it produces for every pic.  There's one JPEG, and one THM which my computer doesn't know what to do with.  But the JPG comes out fine, sends over email fine, and holds clarity pretty well even when enlarged.  According to GE's site, the THM file is thumbnail, to allow it to be displayed on the camera's LCD.  Once the JPEG is downloaded to your computer, you don't need the other file. (SEE MY UPDATE!!)  Another annoying thing is that if you haven't used it for a few days, it can take forever to take a pic, because it's trying to recharge the flash. If that's the case you'll see a flashing red lightning bolt on your screen.  Just hold the shutter down halfway till it stops flashing, then everything should go back to normal.One thing I am still stumped on is the megapixels.  It is supposed to be 16 meg, which should give you really good clarity.  While the clarity is far better than my old point-and-shoot, I expected better at 16 meg.  Again, could be user error or need of a tripod to reduce blurriness.I had a 16x20 print made from one of my pics and framed.  The pro photographer who made the print thought the resolution was high enough that I could possibly even sell prints at that size.All in all, I am very happy with this camera, still experimenting with all the things you can do.  Awesome product for the price and amazing options for not being a true DSLR.  Would recommend it highly as a step up from a simple point and shoot.UPDATE: I have since discovered that deleting the THM file cuts down my jpeg file size by about half, for whatever bizarre reason.  So, DO NOT delete the THM, even though it's irritating to have all those extra files cluttering up your hard drive.  Also, I really wish they would make it possible to shoot in raw format, since jpeg does lose a lot to compression.

I bought this camera for my wife who is reluctantly making the digital transition from 35mm film cameras.  With that in mind, the camera I purchased for my wife had to have simple & advanced features with the feel of a 35mm camera at an affordable price.  The weight & handling is superb with easy access to function buttons & dials, with a right-hand wrap-around grip.  A big plus is the electronic viewfinder, especially for using in bright sunlight or if you have a tremor.  The lens works smoothly & the flash has a fill range up to 20+ feet.  These features are rare on cameras this size & for this low price ($115).After I became familiar with its operation, I took my wife & the camera on a training expedition a couple weeks after receiving it.  She had a blast with it just using the basic features with great pictures (some were manipulated using the software that comes with the camera).  I can't wait until she learns & experiences all the potential this camera has ... wow factor!You will read some reviews that complain about poor picture quality but that may be due to their own inexperience in photography or using this camera.  To counter that perceived issue, when I received the camera, I simply set the camera at 12MP or 8MP & set the ISO limit to 400; thereby, allowing greater latitude for pictures regardless of lighting.  In addition, you want to take note not to push the zoom lens into the \"digital zoom\" range, unless using a tripod.  An optical zoom is more refined & stable.  By observing these tweaks, you can improve overall picture quality by improving resolution.  My wife & found that this camera takes superb pictures ... & you can too with a little practice & some tweaks.So I would recommend this camera to novice & professional photo enthusiasts alike.

After initially buying and using this camera, I've done more research about digital photography.  What I've discovered is that almost any camera can take \"great\" pictures ---that is, if you're not taking pictures of a moving object, and you set it up right and use tripod or hold it perfectly still.I had naively thought that technology had advanced more, but it turns out that the laws of physics and economics don't change much. You see, lens quality is the real bottleneck on picture quality for most cameras and quality lenses are a scarce resource that continue to be hand-made from high quality glass that is extremely expensive. Lens prices aren't helped much from Moore's law.Zoom lenses necessarily require more light because the aperture of the camera shrinks as you zoom out. Thus to get the same exposure at higher zooms you need to use a longer shutter time or a higher ISO, both of which make it harder to take good pictures. The more useful and impressive features like fast-autofocus, good ISO performance, and quick operation generally require the larger bodies of DSLR's. Even high-end compacts are relatively slow. There are always tradeoffs in camera design so it's often difficult or impossible to have your cake and eat it too.This is a slow camera, so you can't just whip it out and catch the action. The zoom is much less useful that I thought it would be because it is so difficult to hold still and even with image-stabilization and a tripod there usually isn't enough light so you have to use a long shutter time but means you can't get moving objects which defeats the whole purpose for me. Also don't expect the photo at 100% resolution to look good at all. It's blurry and littered with huge jpeg artifacts. If you back out on the resolution it can look quite good but then what's the point of having all these megapixels?That being said this is still a pretty good value. The zoom is long. The camera as a whole is good for landscape and still life and occasionally you can get a decent picture of a moving object if you do it in bright, bright sunlight and take into account how slow this thing is. There are a bunch of scene modes for beginners as well as aperture priority, shutter priority, a manual mode so this a decent camera to learn on.But don't expect too much, like I did.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price", "Author": "huizengagirl08", "ReviewID": "R3DCYHKVFQB345", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an awesome camera for the price!

First you set the mode with mode dial on the camera top, then you set whether the shot moves from right to left or left to right, take the first shot, then align the focus marks up and the camera does the rest. This model allows you to choose whether to use the LCD screen or the viewfinder for focusing by pressing a button on the camera back. Sometimes it is easier to focus when using the viewfinder (particularly on long zoom shots). When using the LCD screen on long zoom shots the view is fuzzy, but the picture that is taken comes out sharp. I find that to be annoying because I don't know if the shot is good until it is actually taken. However the camera's 15X zoom allows it a long reach. I can take a picture of a building one mile away and make out details I can't see with the naked eye.

I'm an amateur photographer, but am all right with most cameras that don't have 534853234 functions. Unfortunately, this camera has 4567485645 functions. My photo quality isn't consistent is the only thing that is bothering me. I got some GREAT photos, and then I got some totally out of focus, blurry photos. It seems more random than anything else. As I'll snap a photo, and it'll look great, but then the very next photo will be blurry. I didn't move the camera, I did nothing but take another photo.I can say this, I used the batteries that came with the camera, spent all evening playing with the camera (mostly indoors with flash) and still getting a \"battery full\" icon so it seems great on batteries. Most of the macro shots were pretty darn good, but a few came out with terrible quality. I paid only $94 for this camera (free shipping) so I'm pretty much happy regardless. I might be able to figure out how to get more consistent photo quality, but if not... oh, well. I'll still get lots of great shots, will also get lots of bad shots. I can deal with it.PROS:Great battery lifePotential to get some really nice shotsEasy to holdGreat priceCONS:Kinda heavy around the neckLens cap is rubbish, just falls off. May as well be slated for trash, as it'll fall off while around your neck one day and get lost anyway.Inconsistent photo qualityComplicated for beginnersOverall:Recommended. I like the camera and am going to spend some time trying to get more consistent quality images. If I can do this, will upgrade the rating to 5 stars because this camera has such a great price. Here is a quick video of some of the better shots I got yesterday. Those are INDOOR, macro shots using a FLASH. They have great detail (quite a bit better in the real photo, as well.. downgraded in video, but still quite good), NO annoying \"pet eye\" and are pretty darn good for a camera of this price I'd say. The last photo is a full sunlight, macro shot of a flower (that white stuff is actually on the petals) and is pretty good, as well. These photos were all taken on AUTO setting as I have not totally figured the camera out yet.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Interesting", "Author": "krishna chaitanya", "ReviewID": "R1CY2KVIOHNYNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a good one to have at your disposal.

I can't speak for the longevity of the product yet.  Here are some of the pros and cons:PROS:.  Lots of features for a small price..  Reasonable looks..  Good optical zoom..  Picture quality is reasonable.  Many picture settings are available..  Nice panorama picture taking.  Decent software provided with the camera..  The use of the camera and the controls are intuitive and easy.  Electronic view finder for the eye is nice..  Battery life is decent.CONS:.  Optical zoom is smooth, digital zoom is jerky.  At extreme zoom, the view finder shows mis-focused picture but the saved picture is OK..  The sound recording quality is not good.  The sound recorded with the movies is most pathetic.  Movie without sound is OK.during movie playback on the camera, the sound is not good..  For a 16 MP camera the picture quality is not at par with other manufacturers but then you get what you paid for!Result:I would say that if you are looking for a camera with lots of features at a very reasonable price then this is not a bad product.

Behler", "ReviewID": "R3J4SNCLTZDYLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Please Note:  I am reviewing this product only, not Amazon or the sellers service as it was received as a gift and purchased elsewhere.  Also, I am not a professional photographer or shutterbug, and this camera is reviewed based off the use as a casual user.  As such I am not totally familiar with what other products or features are available in the market.Overall this is a great camera.  I have the metallic green finish which does not seem to be offered on Amazon (there are about 6 colors this camera comes in), and it looks amazing.  This is a very simple camera to use for just point and shoot activity and has some great \"hidden\" features as well.  By hidden I mean they are menu-accessible and you dont have to learn what 75 different hard buttons do to operate your camera.First off I absolutely LOVE that it has a true optical lens with actual optical zoom.  The hidden flash is great for keeping the profile of the camera sleek until the flash is actually needed.  The included (and VERY necessary) lens cap is great and well engineered.  It reminds me of my grandmother's Canon (film) camera with the push button sides to release the cap.  All the hardware aspects of the camera are great and feel well-made.  The lens assemly is all glass (I think!) and metal, giving it the look and feel of a higher-end camera.  The upper thumbwheel is reminiscent of older cameras and really makes switching modes easy, as well as protecting the power slider to prevent accidental turn ons/offs.  The zoom toggle is perfectly placed for your finger and the shutter button (doubling as a focus) is flush-mounted so you dont accidentally change the zoom on your shot while taking the picture.There is no wrist strap for this camera, but rather it comes with a full neck strap which is great as it allows you to actually let go of the camera should you need both hands to do something between shots.  I wish there was some sort of screen protection though, since I'm afraid of letting the large screen rest against my chest if I have a jacket with buttons on or a metal zipper.  The strap and lens cover (attached via lanyard) do tend to get in the way if you're shooting down (say, to get a picture of your dog) as they will fall into the shot if you're not wearing them around your neck.  In that respect its a bit of extra work to just simply snap a photo with the straps attached.  It would have been nice to have a quick release for the straps since you have to thread them through the hard mounts on the camera...not a big deal though and I wouldnt expect it from a camera in this price range.As far as photos and videos go this camera is great!  I have had \"good\" digital cameras and this camera beats them hands down.  I like the large screen on the back of the camera as it gives a great view of your shot and a great playback to see if your previous shot came out well.  Having said that this camera also allows you to bypass the normal \"wait period\" between shots as its preparing a preview.  You can snap pictures one after the other without waiting for the image to appear on the screen.  Essentially you're shooting blind after the first shot but it's still a nice feature.  I find it very useful since the shots seem to be VERY sensitive to movement (of the subject not shaking photographer hands) so when taking photos of something organic (again, my dog), I take about 6 shots all at once and between 1 and 3 usually come out with little to no blur from movement.  Videos come out great with equally crisp audio, and the audio playback off the camera is also pretty good (sounds much better when played off a TV or computer though).  Video mode is very easy to access with its own hard button on the back, rather than having to switch modes in a menu like some cameras.The only thing keeping this item from getting 5 stars is the total lack of a left hand grip.  There is no comfortable place to grab the camera on the left as the case is pretty seamlessly blended in with the lens housing on that side.  The right side has one of the best and most secure grips I have used in any digital camera, but this is really a two-hander (it's much bigger and heavier than a little slimline camera).  I would also like to view my pictures without having to have the lens cap off but to operate any function of the camera it has to be fully \"on\", which means the lens is popped out a bit.  It is a great feature that the camera wont turn on with the cap on, thereby eliminating the risk of damaging the lens telescoping mechanism.Please be aware that this is NOT a pocket camera.  You will need a camera bag like you used to have before tiny digital cameras were everywhere!  I would take the extra heft of this camera for just for the zoom capabilities alone...getting excellent pictures out of it is an added bonus.  So far, power consumption is far less than I expected for something with large moving parts and such a large screen.  With close to 200 pictures (about 25 with flash) and about 15 minutes of video I have yet to notice a change in the on-screen battery meter with the same set of batteries (uses 4 AAs)If you are looking for a small tag-along camera this is probably not a good choice, but if you'd like a camera that can take some real nice or far-away shots this is a great choice.

Amazon has it marked down 34%, what a steal! I was worried about the the quality of the camera though, since it is being marked down so much but I was pleasantly surprised.Before this purchase, I had been looking at expensive DSLRs. Seeing the price, I knew I could never afford one on my tight college student budget, and was really discouraged to the point that I thought I would never be able to upgrade from my 8 MP, Nikon Coolpix. The power pro X500 was the perfect compromise and fit into my budget.Pros:-Great hand grip. I don't have to worry about dropping my camera anymore, and get a much a steadier shot.-High Megapixel: Gives my photos great clarity.-Panorama tool: I love making panoramas, and this camera makes it very easy.-Fish eye tool: Sometimes I just like making fun, unusual photos.-Battery life: So far my battery life seems pretty good.- Manual settings: This camera gives full manual setting and gives cute picture guides on recommended aperture and shutter speed for different subjects which makes learning easier.-Shoulder strap: I've never owned a camera with a shoulder strap before and to my surprise I love it. I don't ever worry about dropping my camera since it now hangs around my neck at most times.-Auto-settings: The auto- settings (both scene mode and full on auto) seems to be decent and are good when in a rush, although I recommend using the manual settings to get the most out of your camera.-Zoom: The zoom is incredible. I can see the caps of the mountains that run close to my city easily with the zoom. I suppose shooting wild animals from afar would be made easier with this zoom as well.-Price: Seriously, what can beat $99?-Hand Stabilization: I have shaky hands, so I often times get blurry photo's but not on this camera. Every one of my pictures have come out crystal clear.Cons:-Batteries: I would prefer a rechargeable battery over AA batteries any day.-User Manual: The user manual was given on a CD rather than a paper. Going paperless is cool and green and all but it's a hassle to have to read the user manual from a computer. A paper manual would be nice to have to pack a way in my camera bag just, in case I am away from my computer and would like to refresh myself on some the camera's settings.-Picture storage: The camera it's self only has enough space on it to hold 3 pictures, which forces you to invest into a memory card.-Flash: The flash settings are not very customizable.- .jpg: This camera only gives the option to shot in JPGs rather than in .RAW which all the professionals use.All in all, I'm glad I discovered this camera and made a purchase. My hobby is flourishing and I have learned a lot using this camera. I now take my camera everywhere, and have captured some really great photos.

Munroe \"donaleka\"", "ReviewID": "R2C5RLL25LM1QA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I do not own this camera; rather I used a brand new one at the volunteer organization where I work. As I was to use it for an early evening, December Christmas Parade, I took it home and got to know its functions. It looked very impressive with many functionalities. What I discovered was very disappointing.Firstly, if you ever plan to use this camera in below 35 degree weather, don't buy it. I noticed in another review that it didn't function in the heat either. At first it shut down after three or four minutes in that temperature.  Even after putting it under three layers next to my skin it shut down, and would not turn back on. Typically I would have shoot 60-90 photos hoping for 5 very good photos. I was only able to take 16. Out of 16, the worst quality went from blank to just blurry lights to unrecognizable faces. Of the nine remaining the only useable photos were those when I'd used the flash. By the way, you must remember to click the flash open for it to work, no matter what the setting. All photos taken using the night or low light feature were too blurry to be of use. The only way I got the one good shot was close up, with a flash and then fixing it up in Photoshop Elements.I brought it home and used it after a few hours, giving it time to warm up, and then again the next morning both times inside. The quality was still bad all around. The macro function didn't work. Without flash the \"Steady\" shot feature to reduce blur was about 30% better than without it, both at a low light setting. Also the \"steady shot\" feature must be clicked on with every next click of the shutter, slowing down your ability to shoot consecutively. Neither were great. As a comparison my iPhone 4 at low light and no setting takes less blurry photos.The camera is noisy when zooming--not good for taking photos at a performance, or on the QT, for example. It is very slow to complete the process of taking a shot, even with the flash, which means you must hold it steady for much longer than an iPhone or my SONY point and shoot. This may contribute to the blurriness. What you see on the video display is not the composition you get. Even using the view finder it was off. For the advertised zoom and pixels it should take much sharper photos.The lens cap doesn't stay on well but that is the smallest complaint I have. I wrote to the executive that purchased the camera for our office that it should be returned because it is not useful in the conditions where it will be used primarily.The only positive comment I can share is that the camera's bells and whistles look impressive. They do not function close to impressively. Your camera phone is probably better than this GE camera.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "S.

Having a view finder in addition to the LDC screen is very nice.  Especially when you are trying to stabilize your camera a little more without using a tripod.  It has 16 megapixels and the 15X zoom is nice also.That said, There are some major issues I have with this camera.  The first is the lens cap.  You can't keep the darn thing on which if extremely frustrating when you are out and about and are like me and ALWAYS have your camera on you.  You can't adjust your image size on the camera, so it takes pictures in 72ppi with extremely large dimensions (i.e. 64x36 inches) which is incredibly frustrating.  I would much rather have pictures at 300ppi and re-size it to a smaller resolution rather than the other way around.  As other reviews have said, it isn't that great in low light settings.  Grain is a MAJOR issue with this camera. Even in manual mode, adjusted properly, it still is a problem. That said, it is possible to take decent pictures indoors, but you need A LOT of light.Overall, its an ok camera. It's Good if you would like to learn on it (which I am doing.

It is very simple and easy to use and does a good  job.  Some of the modes are not clear but my favorite all purpose mode is scene mode.  It has various situations for you to choose from, for example, you are taking a picture of a car going by then it has a mode for that in which it will focus on the car.  Also it has mode for plants that brings out the color and a mode that draws out your picture in pencil, and many more.  The camera is medium size which was a little strange for me because I have large hands so it was difficult to keep my fingers off the lens.

It's inexpensive, yet doesn't look like a cheapy.  I'm no photographer, but I have owned a few cameras.  I like some of the features of this camera and it does a good job of snapping a few portraits.  Where I have to downgrade this camera is with taking action shots and especially action shots from a distance.  I used it at my son's school play (I was in the back of the audience).  It zoomed in well, but most of the shots came out blurry.  It could be me, though.I'm going to research a little, experiment some more, and then come back and update my review.One thing that I do want to note is that if you buy this camera, be sure to buy a memory card.  I only got 3 photos with the built in memory.  Kind of a bummer.  I was really wanting to try it out.  So, I had to order a memory card and wait to take any more photos.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a good basic camera.  My only two troubles were the flimsy lens cap and the problems with close up shots.", "Author": "Steph \"booklover\"", "ReviewID": "R1PXVSF7WZAFSE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a great general use camera.  The instructions for set up are easy and I loved the clarity of the pictures.  The camera use is also pretty intuitive -just fooling around you can figure out most features.  The secure gripping on the camera is perfect and it wasn't too big for my smaller (female) hand.  It also seems durable unlike my Lumix which totally broke down when if fell once.  Plus I absolutely love the stabilization feature which makes taking photos really straight forward.  The only big problem I had with this camera is that I take very close up shots of jewelry and I thought the 15x optical zoom on this camera would be better.  I had difficulty getting any shots up close so the details of the jewelry were apparent (and believe me I tried everything) and had to settle using my 8 year old Nikon (a 4x zoom) instead.  This camera also did not have has many scenes/options to choose from such as Lumix - pretty basic.  The other thing I found slightly annoying is that the lens cap is a little cheap and kept falling into the view of the lens when I was taking `down' shots.  This forced me to use two hands, one to take the shot and the other to hold the cap out of the way of the lens.  This felt awkward and if you are trying to take difficult shots with one hand the lens cap will annoy you.  Plus the lens cap doesn't have a very tight fit on the lens, so I worry it may come off and the lens may scratch.Overall, I am pleased with this camera.  This is a good basic camera.  My only two troubles were the flimsy lens cap and the problems with close up shots.  Also people who love to fool around with different options/scenes will be disappointed by the lack of extra features.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Jerry L.

My last camera was a digital point and shoot 12MP luminix panasonic and at that time I just wanted a digital camera to capture pictures to my trip to Egypt.  It was more expensive than the GE Pro X500 16MP, lol, so I am really excited that I paid less money for this one and get more than just a point and shoot.  I love it that I can take black and white, sepia, and vivid colors.  I can also remove red eye, rotate, and crop all from the camera. i tried the panorama but I kept getting an error that the picture was not aligned properly even though it was because I followed the instructions, but maybe I just need to play with it more.  The result from my intent of using the panorama was very good actually, so i am happy with that feature as well. Will be even more happier when I get it right thought. lol.Okay let's see, the package comes with the software, the shoulder strap, the lens cap, and the warranty card.  I love the way my hands grip around the camera, it makes me feel secure.  The regular point and shoot I was always worried of dropping them or not getting a steady shot, but because of the way the GE Pro X500 is designed, I can have a nice and steady grip.  There is a feature on the camera to use for unsteady/shaky hands and I tried it out but really didn't see much difference.  I tried the zooming to the max and the image was just not the best it can be and again that is due to my shaky hands, i am sure with a tripod the picture would have been really nice.  I still need to try it out on people though, because from my little tiny experiments on my 4year old who moves around a lot I can see a difference there than from the pictures of inanimate objects or pets. lol...but who knows I still got a lot of time to play with it.  I think once I learn how to properly use all the features of the camera and familiarize myself with the camera I will be able to make the best of it and get the best pics possible.  But so far I am really happy with it.The price was excellent, HSN is selling the same cam with some muble jumble software package, for like 175.00 and so glad I found this one at amazon, and got it for the price of 130. As I write this review I believe the price is 124.99.  I got the black one, although I really wanted the white one, but whatever if both cameras do the same thing the less I pay the better.  I am not dissapointed because the black is not bad at all.Okay well that is all for my review, if run into major damage or awesome discoveries I will update.  I'll upload (if I find a way to) some of the pics i took, like fruits/veggies/ apple tree, my dogs, and a hammock pic for you all to see.  Again I am no pro at this.  If you are looking to upgrade from a point and shoot, this camera is just right.  It will give you the opportunity to play around with the pictures before you throw 500 bucks or more on those SLR cameras that might be overwhelming.I gave it 4 stars out of five because nothing is every perfect and gotta leave a little room for error :)", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality and features for the money", "Author": "Homersky", "ReviewID": "R14KPQ8YCFHG37", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You wouldn't believe me if I write a good reccomendation about this camera.

It was within the return policy of K-mart so we took it back and it was happily exchanged.

It's certainly a strong contender for people who want a camera that has many features but is still relatively easy to use for an amateur.  My experience so far has been that the picture quality is mixed, but generally good.  The anti-shake feature works well.  It also has impressive battery life.That said, there are some drawbacks.  The design of the camera is wide like a SLR.  This of course allows the camera to have some better features, but the average person (myself included) is probably going to prefer to carry around something smaller that can fit in a pocket or small bag.  The camera also doesn't have an optical view option, which would be helpful in some situations.  The small window you can use on most cameras to view your target directly is actually an LCD display.  The lens cover is also irritatingly loose.Ultimately, if you are looking for advanced features without the price, this camera is a fine choice.  If you are looking for a camera that you can carry around everywhere and rely on for consistently good quality, you may want to shop around.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bridge over troubled water", "Author": "xkydivr", "ReviewID": "RJ4Y8NELP3RF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My biggest surprise with the camera is that it is made by GE. Evidently I've been out of the loop too long because I didn't even know GE MADE cameras.The GE power pro X500 is a \"bridge camera\". The phrase was coined in the 80s to designate a camera that bridges the gap between point-and-shoot cameras and the more advanced SLR cameras with multiple interchangeable lenses mostly used by professionals.I'm no expert. As a matter of fact ,in my youth ,I was famous for taking pictures with the lens cap on. This camera has a gentle press-fit lens cap which falls off when you turn the camera on and the lens  pops out. I also forget to open the flash and my indoor pictures still turn out great. LOVE the panorama feature. Just take the first picture, turn the camera until the circle and square line up and the camera does the rest! So far I haven't had a bad picture or video. I use the 8GB class 6 SDHC card.  If you want a camera that does it all for you this one does or you have a lot of manual setting if that's your preference.I use the google picasa software because it was already installed on my computer and I'm familiar with it. It works great for downloading and cataloging your pictures. I can't vouch for the GE software because I haven't used it.The manual is on the CD so I don't find it very convenient. Of course you always know where it is but it is a hassle scrolling through to find what you need to know. It is a PDF file so I guess you could print it out if you wanted.... 85 pages. I tried to print specific pages but couldn't get it to work.To sum it up I think the camera is great for the price... works great for the amateur and should satisfy the more advanced photographer.

simply makes the best electronic ever, I have seen some other brands including CANON EOS D51, but I really love my GE handy digital camera the only thing I did not like is that I can not take clear shoot of earth surface while flying over 40,000' my CANON can take clear shoot but with a large lens, I was able to take clear shoot of an air plain flying over Amsterdam while I was flying in different KLM plain, more than anything else this camera takes the best quality videos from every distance it can see, my new born baby pictures and video clips are a good examples.What I love about GE is not only their cameras, simply let us look at medical machines such as x-ray machine and MRI machines in almost every medical facility in the USA, I buy their product not only because of they make the best but also such a company who make their product for success of consumers deserve to keep running.

I tend to shoot a lot of photos at a time, usually well over a hundred. The battery life wasn't as long as I like..... meaning usually after two sessions I'd have to replace the batteries. I take photos several times a week so replacing batteries irritates me! My Uncle is more of a novice photographer and he has absolutely no complaints about this camera, none.

The X500 is basically no good and it's so slow to take pictures [shutter lag], produces a \"THM\" file with every picture I have to delete every single time I go thru my SD card in that camera. This camera is easy to use, takes a decent photo and video and is identical in looks to my old GE X5 digital camera....but this newer X500 simply does not live up to my expectations.

Takes great photos under various light conditions. Pretty much gave up on it after it was hit head-on by a large wave that swamped the boat I was piloting.  It stopped working and the screen gave a lens obstruction error message. But.after drying out for 2 days, it resumed working perfectly. Took night scene of moon over St Lawrence river, indoor photos, bright sunlight photos and indoor photos.  Some lens glare evident  in moon at night photos, but overall better results than I expected. I suspect those people who complained about blur in low light must have used long exposure without a tripod. That will produce a blurred photo even with most expensive camera.  Several people complained about photos coming out white, with no picture.  I think they must have used manual  mode and not set a reasonable exposure time and lens aperture. If you take a photo in sunlight with a 1 second shutter speed and f3.0 aperture it will come out blank white. One has to know how to use any camera. The automatic setting and the scene settings work quite well for a variety of conditions for those who don't  want to deal with \"film speed\", lens apertures and shutter speeds.  For those who do wish to adjust photo properties themselves, the shutter priority, aperture priority and full manual settings are available.

I stumbled upon GE Power Pro X500 by chance and got carried away. This little buddy had it all for only a hundred bucks that I paid for it! ($109 to be precise). 15x optical zoom, image stabilization, advanced manual settings for HQ shooting, numerous presets for any environment out there + cool look and a couple nice features like pop-up flash and a view-finder! (albeit an electronic one). It's not heavy, not huge, you can easily take pictures with one hand holding your ice-cream in the other, and it's a sheer pleasure to carry this beauty around. It turns on really quickly (takes about 1.5-2 sec), shutter speed is also good i believe (considering that i shoot on standard presets, auto mode). The only downside is the quality of the digital screen (3 out of 5, not so many colors, low res) but thankfully it doesn't affect the picture quality :) An the other annoying thing is the lens cap - it doesn't fit tightly, keeps falling off when you shake the camera too much.All in all, th best choice for an amateur in photography who doesn't want to bother with a professional camera but may want to tweak a thing or two here and there just to add an edge to his daily shooting.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Get what you pay for..", "Author": "Lookitsashhole", "ReviewID": "R2IR5GBFWWC1SZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is exactly what you pay for.

You most likely will never find one for the price of this camera. That being said- for the price this camera is a good camera. It is also a good bridge to an SLR type. Think of it as SLR training wheels. There are several features of this camera that I liked and very few that I didn't.The pros: there are a lot of things this camera is capable of and it is packed with options and functionality. There are MANY different modes this camera can shoot in. It also has a view finder and function. For those of you who like to visually line up the photo this is a nice bonus.  Another thing that I liked was the HDR option although it is good, it is not great, The 16mp is standard for most newer cameras and there is nothing too special about it- it does take pictures that look 16mp. The 15x zoom is nice even though half of it is digital. The camera feels good in the hands and has some heft to it. (Some might not like this, but I feel sentimental about the older cameras, this camera is very reminiscent of those).  Another thing that some people might not like but does not bother me is that the camera uses 4 AA batteries. If you are the kind of person that prefers lithium Ion this camera is not for you.  I like being able to pick up batteries where ever I am at any gas station.The Cons: The cameras stabilization could be better. Although it works it could use some improvement.  The lens cap could have been made better, it does not to stay on as well as it should.  The Gui on the camera could use some work, although there is a whole lot of options on this camera some of them are hard to find.  The images are clear in doors but they could be slightly better. (images outdoors seem to turn out very nice)The bottom line: For the price paid, this camera was worth it. It is a good camera, and a great stepping stone to a SLR camera. For about $109.00 there are few cameras that do better. I will give a couple of heads ups: It is slightly larger and will require a larger carrying case. The upper limit on the card size is 16 gb (so don\u2019t by a 32 gb for this camera).  DO NOT GET ONE OF THESE FROM WALMART. They do carry this camera, but if you are not paying attention you will get the \"DIET\" version of this camera for about 128.00$, it will be a 14 mp camera with half the options and half the durability.

Wouldn't have bought the thing with this defect.FURTHER, the 'sleep' function is not adjustable, so the thing is shutting itself down between shots and making you wait for the next one.  And, the night metering isn't the best - you have to 'fool' the system to get some shots or the flash wipes them out. But, then, it is a cheap deal.= = = =  Original Review  = = = = = = =My only other camera is the original Minolta auto which takes great film pics, except for low-light situations.  I looked around a LOT for a starter-level digital __that had a VIEWFINDER__, which is really necessary for outdoor shooting where you can't see the screen and I find quite a bit easier and faster to frame shots with.  The digital viewfinder is not as good a TTL one, but it makes the camera so much easier to work with that I'm surprised they don't charge a premium for the feature.  I find it very easy to use and especially like the broad zoom range.  Works exceptionally well in low light.  Could have just a slightly larger grip area for big hands, but it's still adaptable.  Would not hesitate to buy it again.Very pleased.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A LOT OF CAMERA", "Author": "Earl R.

General Electric is not a brand allot of people brag about. I was impressed with the specifications and decided to go with it. I'm not much of a tech geek or a photographer so I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of technical BS. I bought this camera because I was going to nicaragua on a vacation. When the camera arrived I was impressed on how sturdy and well built this camera was. I was expecting a cheap, plasiticky, and fagile product. This camera has a very solid construction. I was able to take some AMAZING pictures with this camera. When I came back and posted my pictures on facebook everyone was asking what kind of camera I used. The color of the pictures was just simply amazing, the sunsets at the beach were breath taking, I photographed some butterflies upclose and the pictures came out with amazing detail. The battery life also lasts  a very long time. I took over 500 photographs, played with the zoom constantly, and it only drained 50% of the battery life in the 2 weeks I was there.The quality of the pictures like I said are amazing but this camera is not great for moving objects. It takes a whole second for it to shoot the picture. You cant really point and shoot when driving. You can't capture a flying bird. If they make a version of this camera that could shoot photos a lil faster, atleast 3 to 5 photos per second it would be one of the best cameras out there for the price.I ended up giving my camera away to some nice people while on vacation. When I returned in december a few weeks later I recieved a NIKON coolpix p510 for xmas. I was in shock when I opened up the camera and it had the cheap, fagile, plasticky, constuction I thought the GE would have. When I was on vacation I dropped my camera a few times and it didn't phase it. I am afraid that if I ever drop my nikon it will be all over. General Electric is doing an awsome thing here with these cameras. As soon as a new version of the power pro comes out I'm buying it. I'm not saying that my nikon doesn't work, I'm just saying that General Electric is kicking @$$ with these products and I'm a big fan of picture quality, efficiency, and a durable solid construction.

This is still a wonderful camera for the price! I have blown up images to 20X30 with great results. Low light is difficult in some situations too. I found anything over 400ISO way too noisy for me. I shoot in manual mode most of the time and use a tripod. GE would do well to add/fix a few things and up the price a bit to really make this a contender. If your looking for an auto point and shoot only, I would have to suggest a different camera. However, if your know how to use the settings and have a good understanding of camera functions, this camera can shine! I retired my film SLR and didnt want/need the expense of a DSLR.

The software or whatever is in these things went crazy. It began switching rapidly from one program to the next and would not stay in one mode.  I stopped focus and when it did focus the colors severely skewed and the whole think just went crazy at once. I have sent it back to Amazon for a partial refund.

It will function well as an automatic point-and-shoot-style camera (albeit one a bit bigger than is necessary), plus you can use it to learn all about photography settings in a hands-on manner.  The zoom is quite good for this level of camera.  Best of all, Amazon had a great deal on it, so I didn't feel like I was throwing away money just to play around with manual settings. The picture quality is as good as my older Canon point-and-shoot, and interfaced as a PnP device with iPhoto on first try.The caveat to buying this camera is that it is a cheap camera.  I've had it freeze up on me twice in a month of use (about 500 photos in that month).  I removed and replaced the batteries and it reset just fine, but I wasn't expecting freezes in the first week of use.  The shutter delay/lag is also pretty bad.  I took this out to a few of my kid's tee ball/coach pitch games to test out the zoom and shutter speed settings, and missed most of the action that I intended to get.  Even anticipating where things were going to be, I had a lot of difficulty getting the ball in the shot.  I had many shots with just a cleated foot at the edge of a bunch of diamond dirt.  I turned off the image stabilization function and didn't see any difference in the lag time (or, really, the crispness of the resulting photo).  The shutter delay seemed to be independent of most of the AF, stabilization, shutter speed, and aperture settings -- I was always at least a second or two behind what was going on.  It is fairly misleading, too, since the image initially frozen on the LCD screen at shutter press is not necessarily the image that is saved to disk.That said, if I wasn't trying to capture anything fast-moving, this is a perfectly fine camera for around a hundred bucks.  When my kids are standing still (which does happen occasionally, and sometimes even on request), the photos are just fine. The flash worked as expected, and indoor shots came out fine on auto settings and when using the right manual aperture/speed settings.  On auto-mode, it seems to do it's job, and the manual setting options let you learn all about controlling the various aspects of photography without needing a 3 thousand dollar DSLR setup.  I could zoom in at the ball fields and capture kids' expressions while out standing in the field, I just didn't get any action shots of them hitting or fielding the ball...", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Present for Capturing Family Moments", "Author": "Marquita \"quito_24\"", "ReviewID": "RDDD6NFCZOJ9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My brother, 35 years old, wanted a nice camera for his birthday since the last one he had was only a 5mp camera.

It has a lot to offer by way of customizations and such but the focusing system is hit or miss (a deal breaker).  If you touch the zoom after focusing to compose the pic a bit more the focus goes out.  Between two feet and ten feet the pics are nearly always fuzzy.  You are better off to stand WAY back and zoom in then focus, or use the macro zoomed all the way out for close shots.  Outdoors this is no problem: indoors is frustrating.  Nearly all indoor shots are between five and ten feet so it's a coin toss to get a sharp picture, since you can't back off to twenty feet.  A brightly lit room is better, because the \"F\" stop is larger and the \"in focus\" range is greater.The zoom is very powerful, and the battery saving features (switching to eyepiece from LCD screen) is top notch.The lens cap does pop off all the time with slightest jarring......I put it on a short leather strip attached to the bottom of the lens body.....it holds better and still jumps off if I turn the camera on with the lens cap on.

Some of the things you have to give up to get this price are speed, no mount for filters or zoom extenders and it has less than \u00bd the zoom of the longest bridge cameras.A couple of nits I'd like to pick, if I may...You get EVF or rear display, not both.  At least it would be nice if it remembered what you used last and turned on in that mode.  As is, if you hold it to your eye while turning on, you get nothing.  If there's something that I missed in the manual (PDF only)  that allows you to default to the EVF, feel free to post a comment, please and thank you.Operation seems like it could be made a little easier.  For example, to go to portrait mode, it's a position on the mode dial.  Unless it's night portrait, in which case it's one of the preset scenes.  Or a back-lit portrait, which is only available in the auto scene select mode.  What I'd like to see, although I doubt anybody does this, is that you set the basic scene type, (portrait, kids, action...) and then a sub-scene for condition, (daylight, back-light, snow...)  Setting ISO should be a quicker process than it is, too.Minor complaints, though.  To me, it doesn't make much sense to get an expensive P/S (unless you're talking an application specific device like for magazine layout) Even the best still have an EVF rather than a through-the-lens optical view finder, sensors that are too small, and with few exceptions, (e.g. the Fuji HS20) no manual zoom and near worthless \"manual\" focus.  If your main application is 4\u00d76 prints to share with family and friends, the 16MP resolution makes the digital zoom actually usable.  If you really need 36\u00d7 optical zoom, it's available for quite a bit more than the price of this camera, but if you're that serious about photography, an entry-level DSLR, especially if you can get a good deal on an older model, would be the way to go.***A quick update... check out the Fuji S2550.  They look an awful lot alike.  As if this was designed by Fuji to be the bottom of the S2000 series, but they decided there were just too many sacrifices.  Also, I'm getting some strange meta-data mistakes, mostly time and date taken.

Maybe they have some stunning new option that instantly sets them apart from the rest of the players.  Or maybe they have a compelling price or product offering.But they have.  Sometimes business decisions are beyond me, because the GE camera seems to be a very run-of-the-mill camera.At first heft, this is a very attractive camera, with a fully functioning LCD/menu system that looks good and handles well.  But, nothing new here.  It's about the same as, or perhaps a touch less functional, than a Canon camera of roughly the same price.Ultimately, the picture quality tells the tale.  And here's the puzzle: the camera doesn't take that great of photographs.  They are OK, but the image quality to my eye isn't as good as your basic Nikon, Canon, Sony, Kodak, or Olympus.  It's a shade off, a little fuzzy, not a sharp as I'd expect.As I've said, business decisions are sometimes beyond me.  Why would British Petroleum, after the debacle in the Gulf, go back to drilling with the same technology that had the company on the front page of very newspaper, leading the airwaves with the same, tragic images of apparently disposable sea creatures, doomed to die terrible deaths.Maybe GE bought some bit Chinese camera maker, and thinks that slapping the fine GE brand name will sell lots of cameras (I must confess it did attract me).  Perhaps they got a lot of 1 million cameras at a terrific discount, and wanted to move a lot of cameras by putting their name on it.I certainly don't see this as a serious move by GE into the huge consumer digital camera business.  I can see them do a specialty camera, since GE sells $1 million MRI machines and CT scanners.  They have an excellent reputation.

In addition to that, you couldn't even zoom up to the halfway point without the image being really blurry. The focus seems to be really useless. I guess if you used this camera for a basic point and shoot (without using the zoom), it takes fairly clear images, and in that case It's good value for its price. I was just expecting so much more, and was really disappointed.

We knew that it was a DSLR; however we thought we would have to do minimal to take a picture. Instead, we found the icon settings to be cumbersome and not user friendly, but we are truly amateur photographers. Day pictures were easy to take; night pictures were the problem. We found it more difficult to take night pictures because we could never find the proper setting.  The camera seems to have all of the functions necessary to take quality pictures, but you would need a cheat sheet to remember all of them when you are transitioning from day to night. You cannot use one setting for all night pictures, it fluctuates depending on the scenery (an amateur would not know this); this was too technical for us (we just wanted to take a picture). You will need to review the tutorial more than once and create a cheat sheet to carry around to remember the entire setting criterion. The camera lens is very sensitive, windy days will distort the picture making it blurry if you do not know how to hold it very very still. Overall, the person buying or operating this camera need to be more than a novice to operate it efficiently and must remember it will not function as a point and shot!  Amateurs Proceed with Caution!

When I say young, I mean very young, but he did a great job all summer with my fancier cameras, so I wanted to see him with a camera of his own, not too expensive, a good size for small hands, but could produce dependably quality shots.  It was his first camera, so raving excellence wasn't crucial, but I wanted something that would do well by him.  This one had decent reviews, so I took him with his birthday and allowance money, and slid the cash across the table for one of these.His pictures were nearly all coming out out of focus, which I first wrote off as him not managaging the camera properly, probably not being prudent to hold it still or something.  To help, I upped the shutter speed quite a ridiculous bit, flipped on the flash, and gave him a reminder about keeing the camera steady, which iritated him, because he insisted he was.  I then watched him shoot some; he was indeed holding the camera steady.  I checked the pictures.  There was some improvement at this point, but none were sharp, or realy even allthat close to being sharp.  I borrowed his camera for awhile and composed some shots of my own.  As a serious photography hobbist, I can take crisp photos.  I know what I'm doing. I know how to aim autofocuses.  I tested several shots on some objects hat I trusted would be really still, not apt to move in the breeze or wiggle: our picket fence, the beams on our porch, siding, sturdy tree trunks, my napping husband. Then some pics of higher motion stuff: our pet rats, the kids playing, windy leaves and grass.  The ONLY picture that turned out crisp for me was the sleeping husband one.  Most of the others I could tell weren't in focus before I even moved them off of the camera screen and onto the computer.  Remember, additionally, that I had the shutter speed substantially high.  I then apologized to my son fo accusing him of camera wiggle and human error.In short, I'm returning the camera.  I think the autofocus is calculating really poorly.  After some heavy research at home of reviews for cameras in his price range,  think I've found a better quality option for him.  I'm not sure if our particular camera was out of whack out of the box, or if thi is a common problem.  Sorry I couldn't give this a better review, but this really wasn't up to snuff for us.  I dd like theease of functions; it's easy to learn your way around the camera, which would've been great for my kid, as he's he's too young for something that requires much fuss.  I loved the look and feel of the camera for his little hands.  He loved that the shape mimicks an SLR, 'real cameras,' as he calls them, but it wasn't heavy or clunky in his hands, or too big to easily reach the shutter while grippin the camera (a problem he had previously had with my own larger ones).  For the price, if it had functioned decently, it would've made an awesome starter camera for a kid who really loves following in Mom's camera-happy footsteps.  As it was, though, I just couln't justify letting him spend every last penny on a camera--his first big purchase--that wouldn't consistanly output shots he could be proud of.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Christmas for my Wife", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R26KWVQHKH94KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works Great!

The charge was from Magix eu com. That is the software that came with the camera. How did they get my card number to charge me for the program which I never even used!? They illegally charged my account. I am filing a fraud report. This is from Amazon?

It was a disappointment.First I put in a memory card I had purchased for it and it said it was not formatted and the card was defective. I returned the card and got a new one and it did the same thing. I put it in my other camera and it formatted the card, I put it back in this camera and it said the same thing. I took another memory card that I have been using, put it in and it finally accepted that one. Then on to taking pictures. I have used this for over 2 months, trying to give it a fair chance, but after comparing pictures taken at the same time, with the lenses cleaned the same, this one is definitely not as clear, especially on indoor shots. (The other camera is a Panasonic Lumix which retails for $20 more than this one and is a third the size and has a much better zoom).The funny thing is, that, with the lens on this - as it goes out, it has been very off-putting to several people, they comment on how weird it looks. One even compared it to an old sci-fi movie with the edging it has on the sides of the lens. I also have had trouble with the lens cap staying on...So I'm really sorry that this hasn't been a better product for me.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not very good", "Author": "L.
