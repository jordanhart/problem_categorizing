I like to take pictures of nature- flowers, insects etc. and the rest of the family take a lot of indoors, sometimes at events in big auditoriums where lighting isn't ideal and zoom is needed. The continuous 2.8 focal length zoom is amazing. I had now idea what this meant until I used it in a poorly lit auditorium.Pros:Ai+ -I'm an amateur, this feature make my shots look professional.Battery life - I was worried because of some negative battery reviews I read. Just came of an 8 days vacation, I had to recharge battery once.Manual settings- This is the first camera that inspired me to learn to use the manual features, all the buttons you need seem to be right under your thumb....very intuitive.Three function buttons- well placed and easy to configure. You can configure these buttons to bring up features you use most.HD video-great quality, Not saying it doesn't exist but haven't yet heard the zoom motor sound that others complain about.Cons:Scene mode- With the Ai+ feature that works so well, this feature seem underwhelming. I only use the HDR and Panoramic.I'm so giddy (happy) with the features that work well. By the time I fine more cons it will be time to upgrade.I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who want to learn to take great pictures without the frustration that usually happen when you can't figure out how to use the features on a camera.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Lepewhi", "ReviewID": "R19RMHRDZ6LTAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the Panasonic FZ200  and kit and really think that I got a good deal on it.  I think that shooting RAW is the best way to go with it however.  The raw files look horrible, but after being processed, really good.  I also like the wide reach of the lens, now what do I do with my DSLR???", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera terrible manual", "Author": "Michael B.
