Videos are just as bad.It was given as a gift and we have no way of returning so I guess we will just be giving it to a toddler to play with.So if you are looking for a good little camera, look elsewhere, I bought my other daughter a 8MP Kodak last year for less than $50 wish I could trade this one.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Utter Crap", "Author": "Ben Eberle", "ReviewID": "R1GYFJYBPIGIIP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it appeared to be a cheap camera with a fairly high quality picture. In reality it gives you extremely high res pictures of utter crap quality. It's barely better than the camera on my phone, which isn't even a blackberry/iphone/droid - it's a basic phone. Not much more needs to be said - it's crap.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "What was that a picture of again?", "Author": "Joseph Carter", "ReviewID": "R38VCSTUNI64VI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "That's the question I kept asking when taking pictures with this camera.

I purchased the Vivitar 018 locally.  In ideal outdoor lighting the camera performed admirably and captured the scene as I visualized it.  The Vivitar performs well under ideal outdoor conditions.  Indoor performance is horrible, but I didn't expect anything more for what I paid for the camera and after I read the specifications.  You pretty much get what you pay for.  Remember, under ideal conditions and with the correct settings, this camera will give you a decent photograph.  But don't expect it to perform like a more expensive and feature-rich digital compact.  It is a \"fun\" camera, not one for serious photography.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Worth It", "Author": "JadeKiss23", "ReviewID": "R1RCLY5PG5GPLX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't order this camera from this site, but got it from Wal Mart, and I gotta say, this camera is junk. The photos come out extremely blurry and there is no internal storage. I ended up returning the thing to the store for my money back. I was looking for something cheap and decent to replacement mine that had died. While I guess you get what you pay for because the pictures I took with this camera made the people in them look like something from a low budget horror film. Sections were blacked out and others just blurry. Also the feature with the flip around display does no good, it doesnt flip the display on the device, so you still end up turning the whole camera upside down. Really save yourself some trouble and dont buy this camera.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap Camera", "Author": "M.

They're blurry and just horrible quality. The memory is also really low, one picture fills up the camera so you have to have a memory card. I would buy this camera for a cheap gift to give to a kid, not something I would use for myself. I do not suggest buying this camera, spend a little more money and purchase something worth what your spending.

That was not the case at all. I recieved my camera and began to notice that the outside quality of it was very cheap in style, I also have a 20 dollar Slick camera and that camera has better quality than this one does. I turned the camera on and it worked for about 20 mins and then shut off and never came back on. No matter what I did, I brought new battries, tried a new memory card, Everything! I called customer service and they told me that there was nothing they could do about it since it was refurbished and that they were sorry that this happened to me. Whatever you do please DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! It's a waste of time and your money.  Also Customer Service Sucks Big Time!", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "not satisfied", "Author": "Shalini", "ReviewID": "R3SO1U4P272YCL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera looks like a toy..picture quality is not soo good.
