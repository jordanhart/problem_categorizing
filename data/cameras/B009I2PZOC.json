The 50x zoom works great and the pictures are crystal clear. Being able to shoot a picture while using the video function is great. The rechargable battery is holding up well and i have yet to have it run out on me while i'm out. The only downside is the size. It is bulky and gets a bit heavy around the neck after an hour. Canon should have included a usb cord to download the pictures but the old ones from the canon cameras work. It has a separate HDMI port so i can run the videos on my tv.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 50x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Deluxe Bundle With 8 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card, Digpro Compact Camera Deluxe Carrying Case", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411J%2BVVzFBL.jpg", "ProductID": "B009I2PZOC"}}
