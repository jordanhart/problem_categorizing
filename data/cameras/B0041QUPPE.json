Have only owned it for a few hours...so this review may not be comprehensive enough.  But first impressions say a lot!  I was hoping for simplicity as it has only a few buttons...and while I understand how to manuever through the functions, I am finding myself needing to coach my daughter on how to set up the modes with each use.A downfall, is that even though it has \"anti-shake\"...it doesn't tell you that your subjects have to remain PERFECTLY still to capture any picture with clarity. And yes, I have tried it in \"Sport\" mode.  Also, for now I am finding that a forced flash is what will increase the sharpness of the pic, but the lighting is then too much.Either way, I won't be returning it because she is happy and afterall, what matters to her is that it is purple!

I chose it because my daughter wanted a purple camera that would also record videos w/sound, I had good memories of my first camera being a Vivitar, and the price was right.  We haven't been disappointed and we've had it for 7 months. It's also come in handy for my own use in a pinch. The only drawback is that it does seem to use up batteries rather quickly. I haven't printed any pictures yet so I can't speak to the quality of the resolution.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality", "Author": "Laurence \"Lorenzo\"", "ReviewID": "R32M3D7HVPO7F5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must say that even for me this thing seems cheap, not just light weight but non functioning flash.I feel bad for my ten year old daughter. Most cell phones have a better camera.

It was such a waste of money! The picture quality and display screen are terrible! It's super confusing to use, I myself even had trouble figuring out how to make it do the simplest functions such as turn the flash on and off, and it kills batteries instantly. Before we even took enough pictures to fill a third of the memory, the power would be completely drained. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "2.4\" TFT LCD color monitor\n4x digital zoom\nPoint and shoot design\nFace detection\nSmile detection", "Name": "Vivitar ViviCam V7024 7.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.4-Inch LCD V7024-GRAPE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51j31-QV-QL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0041QUPPE"}}
