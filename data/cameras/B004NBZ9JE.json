{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good basic camera for those who want to point & shoot", "Author": "D-Squared", "ReviewID": "R2VAS9DWIUZKF9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for a family member who knows nothing about cameras or photography and who has no interest in learning more than just push the button. :) So, when shopping for a camera for her, my criteria was - how good will it do on full auto. It needed to focus quickly and accurately and I wanted it to have reasonably nice image quality. I bought this and tested it out for a few days.The focus is fast and accurate just as I was expecting on a Panasonic - they usually have very good focus (accurate) on full auto in the point and shoot camera category. On the widest angle setting, outdoors, the picture quality is very nice. Once you start to zoom, picture quality is not the greatest but still OK. Macros are very good on this too. It's very easy to operate if you are a novice. You can set it on iA (intelligent auto) and the only buttons you have to operate are the shutter button (press half way down to focus; press the rest of the way down to take the picture) and the zoom toggle on the top of the camera.I wasn't super happy that there was no dedicated movie button (it's in the menu) but I knew she would not likely use the movie function. I also knew that most of the photos she might take would be of her son and grandson, so mostly wide angle (better photo quality) would be fine for her and a little zoom on this still gets you a decent image in terms of quality. I liked the size and weight of this - slim and light weight. I liked the size and shape of it so much that I almost bought one for myself but I prefer different features and better image quality when fully zoomed out.Bottom line is - she loves it and actually uses it! Before this, any camera was too complicated for her to even give it a try. This one is not intimidating. This camera has plenty of settings to try out too and I encourage you to try those (sports, portrait, landscape, etc) as you can often get even better results with those.It was between this and Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Silver). I thought the Elph might actually be too small for her to be comfortable with AND you have to be willing to work the settings more to get the best photo. I find the full auto on the Elph does not consistently lock in on the right subject when focusing - so I knew any camera she had to \"fiddle with\" would not be the best choice for her. The image quality on the Elph is a bit better but ONLY if you work with the different settings and modes (it also didn't have 8x zoom).If you want a budget camera that you can put on full auto and get the right subjects in focus, this is the one I would recommend. 16MP is too many for this small sensor. 9 or 10 would be much better in my opinion in terms of image quality BUT, in terms of what I was looking for and the budget P&S; camera category, it is a 4.5 star rating. In terms of all point and shoot cameras in the world, I would say 3-ish so I gave this 3 stars. I wish camera manufacturers would stop playing the mega-pixel race game and concentrate on image quality.I've uploaded several sample photos taken on iA too, so check those and others out for more of a feel of what you can expect from this camera.I try to make my reviews as helpful as possible so please feel free to ask a questions in comments. I am happy to answer if I can. :)", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally a decent camera that takes sharp photos", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RMZ68C32XGATV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this because I was very unhappy with the new Canon A3300 that I also purchased just a week before this one. I did extensive photo tests with both cameras because I felt the Canons overall sharpness was bad. Both cameras are 16mp and although i'm a Canon fan I have to say they failed on the A3300. Even with setting custom sharpness, contrast and saturation, the normal straight out of the box settings on the Panasonic were way better.The two big problems with the canon were most photos even bright outdoors had way too much noise. The other problem was no matter what setting and focus type, only the center areas were in ok and i mean ok focus. All four corners of the photos were on the blurry side and that's just unacceptable. Compared to this Panasonic...wow, much better and much sharper. When fully zoomed in there was a bit of noise but its expected. Night shots depending on how you take them also have noise but again depending on how and what you can work around it a bit.There are minor differences with the two cameras like the zoom smoothness was a bit better on the canon and the user interface and menu screens were also a bit better on the canon. Not a deal breaker at all because I'd rather have quality over cosmetic things. The other minor things i found were that the Panasonic has the af assist light very close to the top corner of the camera where you put your fingers. Also the on off and photo/play aren't buttons they are switches which i'm a little worried about breaking so we'll see how they last.One of the biggest differences is that this camera is faster. I found that saving photos is almost instantaneous on the FH25 but on the canon it was about a 4 sec pause to save before you could take another (a \"busy\" icon shows up. Most of all the functions on the FH25 are faster and i like being able to grab the camera and take photos quickly.Overall i'm all about quality and sharp photos and this camera does that. If you don't care about the spare battery cost or that the user interface and menus look like 20 years old, i think you'll be happy with this camera.Photos for the most part are well exposed and using the full Ai seem to always come out perfect. There will be a slight bit of noise in certain shots but sharpness is never an issue. The whole thing about higher mega pixels is better isn't completely true, its all about the sensor size. Do some research about that as I did but believe me, this camera really does a great job. I've posted a few sample photos.UPDATE 8-17-11Still loving the picture quality of this small camera. I even tested out the new Canon SX230 and again this FH25 was sharper and photos were exposed better.  The full iAuto setting is amazing and it reallydoes a great job, I've taken photos with it that I will be publishing in my second book next year. That's how good I feel the quality is.Update: there are batteries available for only $10.00 making this camera a great choice.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "R. L. Shagon", "ReviewID": "R1OSNTRCGR3Z2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lot's of positives for this camera:Advertised as 8x optical zoom but that's video. It's 10x in photo mode, 22.5x if you employ the digital zoom as well.16.1 mp is amazing for a camera in this price range. I actually used the max digital zoom and still got good resolution photos.About 2 dozen scene modes (portrait, beach, sunset, etc) that work well and are easy to select. Text scrolls across the screen explaining its use as you you move from mode to mode.Very easy to use. About 1/2 hour with the manual and camera and you can understand and begin using all the features.Image stabilization sems very effective. I shot every thing hand held even at max zoom and liked the results.Great battery life. I chrged it 1x on a week vacation but that was just in case. Could have gone all week with 100s of shots.Like most digitals the camera has very little built in memory so you need to buy a memory card. I chose the PNY 16 GB that has more room than I think I'll ever need.One negative this camera shares with most point and shoots: you miss a viewfinder in very bright sunlight. But the screen is bright enough to make it manageable so I still rate this very highly.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Product!", "Author": "Cam", "ReviewID": "R32NWALMVHWZUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't offer too many reviews, but this one was worth the effort. If you are looking to purcase a point and shoot, the Panasonic DMC-FH25 is probably the best camera for the money. I did quite a bit of research and was taken by the 8x Zoom and 16.1 MP. And it wasn't much more money than those cameras with fewer megapixels and features!  It's easy to use - whether you are taking close-ups, or panoramic shots, the controls are intuitive and handy. With flash, without flash, macro, zoom... it's really just a few simple clicks and your taking great shots. Right out of the camera with no touch up the photos are well balanced and accurate.(I've uploaded some of the shots on the Panasonic DMC-25K page above.) I didn't even bother to read the manual, I was too excited to start playing with the 16.1 Mega Pixels!  :)  I've seen some reviews where the reviewer was less than enthusiastic about a feature or two... these are probably the kinds of people that complain about everything!  They probably should have purchased a DSLR and been done with it!  My guess is they'd find something to complain about THAT too. I digress... The fact is, for the money, I'm really pleased and happy with this purchase. The only thing I need to do is read the manual and I'll be all set. Oh, one other really fun feature that I found accidentally... When I hooked the camera up to an HDTV, (with included cable), there is a slide show function that has MUSIC built in!! Five or so different songs that play in the background while you watch the images fade and slide across the screen.  That is a really nice touch Panasonic!  It should tell you how much thought went into the design of this Lumix.  Thanks for reading!!  :)", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent camera with an incredible Leica lens", "Author": "S. H. Roth \"cat lover\"", "ReviewID": "R31NNHL9U77TK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about a month and it is fantastic! I have taken photos using both theautomatic intelligence mode, where the camera does all the settings, and the My Picture mode, where youcan choose options such as ISO, flash settings and so forth. I have also tried various optical zoom lengths.Some of the pictures were taken in less-than-optimal conditions, like in the rain and under fluorescent lights.All of them came out great, sharp and with excellent color. I have noted several  reviews that mentionproblems with color rendition. All of my images have been taken using the \"Natural\" setting, which isone of several \"color bias\" settings. It is worth noting that the color bias selected will be used evenwhen the iA mode is selected and, before I realized that, I had some pictures with terrible colorbecause I had left the camera set to \"Vivid\". I have not yet used Macro but have tried various opticalzoom lengths and have not had any of the problems with poor focus or decreased clarity, also mentionedin some reviews. I have posted several images. The 4 kitten pictures were taken under fluorescent lightand the leaves and flower were taken in the rain. All were done using the highest resolution setting,automatic white balance and \"natural\" color setting and ISO 200. The camera was hand-held. No editingwas done except for cropping of the images of the white kitten (the full image pre-crop is also shown)and the book/leaves. Both were tightly cropped to the center portion of the image, and remain verysharp and detailed. I am especially impressed by the white kitten, where multiple tones of white can beseen.  I was concerned at first by the lack of a detailed manual instead of just a CD and I originallyplanned to print out the manual after loading it on my computer, so I could have carry-along instructions.However, after going through the manual, most of the settings are easy to find and use and I may onlyprint a couple of the more difficult to find directions, like how to format an SD card.  This is a wonderfulcamera which takes excellent pictures and I am very glad I purchased it, despite the negative reviews.Additional information: I have now been using this camera for 7 months and still love it. The onlycriticism I have is in regard to the lever used to zoom; it is small, with a narrow range of motionand it can be difficult to stop at the exact distance you want.  It is a minimal problem but onethat can interfere with my photographing my favorite subjects; kittens waiting for Forever Homes at theSPCA. I have also discovered that this camera has a surprisingly powerful flash that can \"wash out\"pictures if I am not careful. I prefer natural light pictures, so I keep the flash turned off forboth IA and normal picture settings and set the sensitivity at 200 or 400. Even in low light, thepictures look very good and I have posted a couple on this site as illustrations.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "serialshopper", "ReviewID": "R75KR838L96O3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a novice photographer and basically wanted an easy to use point and shoot to take pictures of my family and friends.  One reason I gave the camera 4 stars instead of 5 was because the camera does NOT zoom while taking video.  I was a little upset b/c I thought that this version, unlike the FH20, was suppose to have this feature.  I wish I purchased the ZS5 model instead.  Besides that fact, everything about the camera is great.  It takes very good quality photos fast.  The video is also good quality.  It does well in low light and in fast moving action.  I have only had the camera for a few weeks, but so far so good.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Great Guy", "ReviewID": "R2X5G2H9WPZSCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had this camera for very long before writing this (only 1 week), so I'll update in about a month. So far, however, it's exactly what I expected. I was going to get the Nikon Cool Pix, but that had too many bad reviews. So I bought this one. I tested it just once by taking photos INDOORS under flourescent light. Photos came out better than I thought they would. Digital screen is bright, and has settings that even allow you to change the angle of view in case you're holding the camera above your head.The other reason I bought this is the size and ergonomic design. I need a small, decent camera to take around w/ me for misc parties and such. I have another, much better Canon SLR, but that one is big, bulky, heavy, and as such difficult to keep inconspicuous. In the past, when on vacation or in another country, I was often the center of attention when I pulled out the camera or traveled on public transportation. That could be quite dangerous. So, I opted to buy this camera. Has a nice, attractive design, nice blue color, but not so nice that it looks like it's $1000 bucks. And if it's stolen or I'm robbed, I'll be mad, but it's not as if it'll take $1000 bucks to replace! And I could hide it while traveling. It's small enough to put in your pocket. It would bulk up your pocket, but it's much safer than carrying around an SLR around your neck.Some of the cool features is face recognition technology. It actually puts a square around people's faces! It will focus on those faces. That feature I did test and it works. The few photos I took were very clear, focused, color was as true to the real scene as I could tell. And I only used a setting that saves 5m of information.Most features are easy to get to quickly, using the menu buttons and such. There's even a feature that allows you to set a \"normal\" scene setting if you know you use it a lot. This allows you to go back to it quickly if in a different scene setting.One con is that some features aren't available depending on the scene you're using. That would be fine, except that it will take a few months of using the camera to really get familiar w/ what you can and can't use depending on the scene setting. The instruction manual is unfortunately on CD-ROM in pdf format, so if you're away from your computer and you need to look up a feature to remind yourself how to use it, you're out of luck.But those are cons I'm willing to live with. I didn't expect this to be as good as my SLR, and indeed it's not. There is no manual focus, for instance, the flash is somewhat limited. But I didn't buy this camera to have manual focus and a good flash. I bought it to be able to hide in my pocket, travel w/ it, get quick, high quality-in-focus pictures, and not worry about replacement value. My initial tests confirmed I can do all of that and even more.So far, so good.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CAMERA!!!", "Author": "pachiqueen", "ReviewID": "RWK0TBCXSN2MJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has really impressed me!In the past I had a really old sony cyber shot that work ok but never did a great job has I've always wished. I've seen how Canon Power Shot work, delivering pictures that have great colors and focus very well, with no blur at all. However the price of the Power Shot, when I was comparing cameras, were way higher than this Panasonic lumix. They offered less MP (14 MP and 12 MP vs 16 MP) and just half of the zoom (4x vs 8x). So, in terms of features and price, between Canon and Lumix, the Lumix is a better option.The intelligent auto mode works GREAT as a \"point and shoot\", it has a very fast shutter speed! and focus great!. If you want to play more with the features like amount of light or enhance colors, the Lumix has already options to make it even easier like \"candle light\" mode, \"food\" mode, \"sunset\" mode, etc, and they work very well. Also it has a panoramic mode that helps to make nice panoramic shoots although it doesn't acoplate the pictures itself.I also have to say that if you don't have basic knowledge of how to manipulate the menus of any point and shoot camera (like my old sony cyber shot), it could take just a few days to discover everything that this camera can do, but when you do you will be amazed! also the Optical Image Stabilizer works great! but you have to pay attention on have it ON, otherwise it won't work, of course!And last but not least, My brother and a friend, both professional photographers, each own DSLR cameras, they both agreed that the lenka lenses have the best quality in the market wich the lumix has.Finally, I always wanted a point and shoot that would allow me to \"play\" as a professional photographer and take interesting and nice pictures.

WOW! not only does it take incredible pictures, the VIDEO is superb! And that includes audio, folks! OK it does not have the battery life to take more than 1/2 hour of video, but it is not designed as a full feature video camera. It is a pocket sized snapshot camera. And that it does superb as well.

The \"Food\" setting provides brilliant color on close ups with no flash, and the \"Sunset\" setting gave me some breathtaking results. Out here in Arizona, daytime shots can be challenging in the extreme bright sun. No problem with the DMC-FHK. Just choose the \"Beach\" scene mode and WOW!

Back to an electronics store we went. I struggled with the menu on the Nikon, then it dawned on me that what I really wanted in a camera was simplicity without too much of a compromise on features. When I picked up the Lumix DMC-FH25, I liked it instantly. The locations of all the buttons felt right. The flash was not in the way. Without access to a user guide at the store, I pressed each button and figured out what its purpose was. The husband glanced through a few of the MANY available shooting modes and was pretty impressed. I ordered the camera from Amazon a few days later.This camera is perfect for my needs. I don't want to be a professional photographer. I don't take pictures to enter them into contests. I don't intend to decorate our home with poster-size reprints of landscapes. I don't mind at all that the Lumix DMC-FH25 doesn't have a lot of room for manual maneuverability. I do like -- very much at that -- that this camera was easy to learn (with a little help from the husband because I got impatient, lol). I am excited about the shooting modes (the one named \"Food\" made me laugh out loud)! I also like that a simple description scrolls across the bottom of the LCD screen when you select each shooting mode, so you know what the mode does best. I like that it's small and it fits comfortably in my small hand. I am also pleased with how quickly pictures are taken and stored so I can move on to the next shot (I ordered Transcend's Class 10 8GB SDHC card with this camera).There are SO MANY digital cameras out there. If you want something simple with a few bells and whistles but will not frustrate you with a steep learning curve, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH25 is worth considering.UPDATE on 11/25/2011: Still enjoying this little powerhouse of a point-and-shoot digital camera after a month of use. Experimented with Normal picture mode to an extent and decided my photography skills are simply nothing to write home about, so I switched to iAuto mode full-time. Uploaded two pictures taken yesterday (Thanksgiving) and today in the image gallery for this camera. The Thanksgiving picture is the one of the coffee mug and flowers. The other picture is of our Lab/Shepherd who was just trying to take a nap in the sunlight that poured into our kitchen.Video-taking with this camera is also easy to manage. Yes, you cannot zoom in or out while shooting the video. Some may find this an annoyance, while others will not be hindered. I have taken two 30-second videos with this camera so far and the playback quality is excellent. The camera's mic also picks up the volume of chatter in the video more than capably.

A true go anywhere camera- love the intelligent auto mode.  Don't even have to tell it I want to shoot in macro mode, it figures it out and switches automatically.  Same with portraits.- Very good quality images for a 16MP point and shoot even at full size magnification.Cons:- as other have noted the battery could last longer.  It's a 600MaH battery and an extra one from Panasonic is $30-$50.  Fortunately if you search Amazon for \"Wasabi Power Battery for Panasonic NCA-YN101G \" you will find a replacement with twice the capacity for around $10.  Why buy an extra Panasonic battery when for ten bucks that one battery will last as long 2 Panasonics?  Older reviews indicate there are no 3rd party batteries that will work in this camera, but that is not true any longer.- It's a 16MP camera with a tiny image sensor so at full magnification there is a lack of sharpness that is very noticeable (at full magnification of the image) when shooting in less than ideal conditions.  This isn't the fault of this camera, every point and shoot camera has a tiny image sensor and 16mp is too high for those sensors to record every pixel accurately.  In ideal, outdoor conditions and in some cases with the flash close up they look very good though.  For those who will never print at larger than 10x14 or only display at greatly reduced resolutions (such as on monitor or HD TV) this is a non issue.  Do not think reducing from 16MP to 10MP (this camera allows this) will change the lack of clarity at full magnification as it can't.  It's still the same sized image sensor, just not using all of the area.  If you want a camera for large prints, choose lower MP in point and shoot or go DSLR for it's larger image sensors.  I will note that the lack of clarity at full magnification is proportional to how far away the subject is.  For macro shots I am incredibly impressed.  Those are very clear even at full magnification.In between Pro and Con:- the 720P video mode is OK.  The sound is what you would expect, wind noise will be a problem outdoors and voices from far away will sound 'off'.  Same as any video from any camera with an internal mic.  The video quality itself seems fair.  About what I would expect from a camera with a video mode.Overall:Nice little camera for the price.

The zoom is a nice feature for a camera of this class (mid-range). 5x zoom is pretty much the industry standard and sufficient for most people. I like this camera, it satisfies my every need. It has the best features of my previous cameras.  Photos (day and night) are great, HD video is great, and its pretty fast.  I recommend getting a 8GB Class 6 SDHC card the fully enjoy this camera.

I found it very easy to learn how to use, and it's enabled me, in a relatively short period of time, to grab some pretty nice images -- if I must say so myself. Normally I write long, verbose reviews. This time, I'll just let the 4 sample photos I uploaded above speak for themselves. And for the FH25. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I'm certainly no professional photographer. But I've dabbled in photography for a number of years, and I was very pleased with the results after having only worked with the FH25 for a week.(NOTE: I will be replacing the FH25 with the Lumix ZS8, but it's not a knock on the FH25, it's more a matter of preference: larger zoom (16x vs 8x), the 3\" monitor (vs the 2.7\"), the manual control options/settings, more reasonably priced replacement batteries and chargers, center position tripod mount, 2 \"My Scenes\" vs 1, and the ability to zoom in video mode -- all available on/for the ZS8. But the FH25 really got me hooked on Lumix cameras. It's somewhat smaller and lighter than the ZS8, which I see as a plus, and for the price, it's a great, capable, very user friendly camera. In terms of the ergonomics, I actually prefer the FH25. I like the Mode button on the back, rather than the Mode dial on the top. I got very good at switching back and forth without ever taking my eyes off of the screen. With the ZS8 I have to look up on the top and fiddle with the dial, making it a slower, more cumbersome process. I also prefer the placement of the tiny top speaker on the FH25 compared to the ZS8. It's almost a guarantee that everyone's left index finger is going to be blocking the ZS8's speaker. It's literally RIGHT THERE where you place your finger. It's not that big of a deal, it's just annoying. There's plenty of real estate up there; it could have easily been moved over a couple of inches. At first I thought I'd set the volume of the \"beep\" on low, but I hadn't. It sounded low because my finger was covering the speaker.)", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for price!

And the pictures it produces is top notch. Also there are no accessories available for this camera compared to what the manual states.An extra battery is like $50 bucks which is outrageous.

I have a Canon AS 590 IS bought through Amazon which takes excellent photographs, but it only has a 4X zoom. I take indoor, outdoor, low light, wildlife pictures and pictures for a local flea market. I wanted a longer zoom for the wildlife pictures that the Canon could not reach.I looked at cameras with a 10X to 30X zoom from $150 to $400 and read all the customer reviews and all the professional reviews. The pro reviews usually showed pictures taken at full zoom which was very helpful. Any camera I saw in the stated price range has a slight softening to a horrible softening at full telephoto.Last Saturday I was disappointed with all of them for the long zoom shots. I saw a sale flyer for this Panasonic DMC-FH25 at $99, so I looked on Amazon and reviews were extremely favorable. I found a pro review and the zoom shots were the best I had seen. I decided to buy the camera, figuring if nothing else, the zoom was worth $99.I have used the camera all week long and it has been equal or better to my beloved Canon and the zoom is as good as advertized. I have an old oak tree 100 yards behind the house and with the E Zoom button I focused and shot the picture. The photo came out so well I can see the bark pattern on the tree.The camera is very easy to use and with the IA mode (Intelligent Auto) I did not have to do anything but press the shutter button (after pressing half way down to allow the auto focus to lock) and the pictures are great. So far it is the best $99 I have ever spent.Pros: Super easy using IA mode and excellent results (sharp pics)E Zoom one touch button uses 8X optical zoom and digital zoom to make 18x with no visable picture degradation.Exposure levels can be changed by pressing one button on back of the camera. This is great for getting the right exposure on a white flower under a bright sun.LCD on back can be set so you can hold the camera up over your head and still see the screen. This is great if you are behind a crowd but want to take a picture of an event.Quick menu button enables you to make menu changes on the fly to improve light compensation filters.It is super easy shifting from stills to movie mode at 720p. And movies look very good.Battery life is very good. It ran for hours while I accustomed myself with camera features. Battery comes out easily and recharges in an external supplied charger.Camera is very small, yet feels good and looks great.LCD screen has modes to adjust for taking pictures in bright light.Party mode takes great indoor low light pictures.Cons: No manual focus, but then the auto focus works very well.Battery takes over two hours to recharge from a complete drain.Movie mode files are .MOV and need to be converted to .WMV for Windows Media Player. There are ways if you search on the Internet.Software that comes with the camera for picure handling was barely adequate. I just use my Canon software instead.So far those are the only drawbacks. I will update if I find more things good or bad.Update 4-17-2012 The battery is easy to remove and reinstall. It takes just under 2 hours to recharge from zero. The battery and SDcard cover is just a slide on off so no worry about it breaking the plastic. The battery is good for 200 pictures without flash and indoor pictures are good without flash under normal daytime conditions. You can take all your pictures using IA mode if you care to do so. Macro pictures are great. AF Zoom allows you to take a macro from 3 feet away. Indoor pictures usually snap at 400 ISO without a lot of noise.

Those saying this camera does not take good pictures probably can not use it. I had initially  taken over 2000 pictures with it within a one week period. Constantly turning it off and on. The color and clarity of the photos was incredible . I bought a Nikon S9100 a few weeks earlier than this one and had to return it cause the quality of the pictures were not up to par. Even though the Nikon was an incredible piece of tech the photos just looked flat and not crisp. With a few shots of this LUMIX I was convinced it took incredible pictures. I am a person who is not a professional at photo taking but often am complimented on how my photos look like Post cards. I usually use an upper end Kodak that creates incredible crisp and vibrant pictures. Due to the incredible lens and tech it contains. This Lumix was able to give me the same feel and was allot smaller for when I am not able to lug around a big camera. Remember this is a point and shot camera. It is not a manual camera. It will take pictures people spend thousands on filters and camera gear to accomplish automatically!!  It is small and very powerful.  Unless you need Super Macro or Super Zoom, this camera will work fine. My macro pictures turned out nice. It caught a Bee hovering above flower and caught the wings that were visible without blur!!  It is fast!!  The ISO is also great. If you are thinking about a camera, a Lumix is a great camera. Buy an extra battery. The battery is long lasting but since this camera is so easy to use you might just want to have an extra. I used one while on vacation and was glad I had it. Read the Manual.

My daughter is three and between snacks, a change of clothes and her entourage of stuffed animal friends there is just no way I'm toting a bulky camera on the chance that she does something cute. And on those rare occasions I do manage to bring it, by the time I adjust the settings I've already missed the shot.  More often than not, in my hurry I've also adjusted the settings incorrectly and ended up with a blurry, unusable photo.  I realized that I was constantly missing memorable moments when all I really needed to do was change cameras. A big complicated camera just doesn't make sense when your trying to catch your toddler's spontaneous moments of adorable.So, I started looking.  After spending several hours on the internet I decided on this one.  The AI mode is perfect for those moments when you only have enough time to turn your camera on.  At the same time there are several manual options that are great for parents.  The Kids Mode encodes your photo with your child's name, date and age (Years, Months, Days). You only have to enter your child's name and b-day once and it saves the setting.  Another is Burst.  When turned on your camera will continuously snap pictures as long as you hold the button.  Once released it writes them to file.  Like most parents I like to take multiple pictures to ensure I get the shot.  If my daughter blinks its okay because her eyes were open in the next frame. I also liked the soft skin mode (more for me than my daughter).  It really seemed to soften smile lines and crows feet which I think any mother with small children can appreciate.I was going to order from Amazon, but to ensure delivery was on a day that I'd be home I needed to wait until Thursday to order.  Later, I was picking up a few things at Walmart and decided to see if they had this model so I could try it out in person.  They did and it was $149, same as on Amazon.  Since you can return any digital camera purchase within 15 days if your not happy, I decided to purchase it from there.  Also, their store warranty was cheaper by half.*Edited 8/16/12:Another reviewer stated they had to remove the battery to charge it. I'm not sure why there would be a difference or if they reviewed the wrong model but that is not the case with mine. I was surprised actually because all of my previous cameras have had a large battery pack that had to be removed and plugged into an even larger battery charger. I just assumed it was that way for them all. However, this camera has a small flat battery positioned in the bottom next to the memory card.

I really tried to compare features, reviews, etc for my new camera from numerous websites. While the FH25 had less reviews than the other Sony / Canon cameras in its class it generally had no negative reviews. I normally go with Canon but I had read good things about the Lumix / Leica lens. I took the camera on a recent trip to Yosemite to test it out. I took 686 pictures mostly outdoor and a few in low light / sunset. It seemed like the Intelligent Auto feature always selected landscape even for pictures with a lot of motion which left the final image blurred (waterfalls). I also kept having to decrease the white balance because the pictures / details were too washed out in the auto mode. When I returned home to look at the end results on a bigger screen I was completely disappointed. The colors looked saturated and most if not all of the images look either grainy or soft. While my previous Canon A720 lacked the megapixels, features, etc when I compared the pics of my last trip to Yosemite the Canon images beat the Lumix images hands down. I tried to go cheap and lost out, maybe I just got a dud? I am sending it back. I still think I did enough homework and based on the other reviews / research.?

I love this camera so much I bought another one as a present for my mom and she loves hers also. I use a 16gb memory card to store pictures and videos with. The videos can be played back on your computer as they're .mov files that windows can play on it's own without installing any special software. My only complaint is that you can't zoom in and out on the camera while recording. you can zoom in and out prior to recording but not during recording. I won't take away a star for that as the quality of the video is still very good. The video quality in bad in very low light and will turn out grainy. as long as you know this ahead of time you can make sure to have the blinds/curtains open to let sunlight in or have lights on indoors as this is not ideal for video recording in low light. It does take good pictures in low light as it uses the flash.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera With Only One Minor Flaw", "Author": "J.

Did not need supplied softwareCons:None worth mentioning -- 16 megapixels is overkill, thoughSummary: A great little camera that does more than the price suggests. This model offers more than the SZ1, although both are now priced the same. I like convenience of the separate battery charger that enables use of the camera while charging spare battery on the FH25 (SZ1 needs to be connected to charge -- worth buying the charger, it's the same unit as for the FH25).Just as important, I've had a lot of fun using this camera!UPDATE: after taking a few thousand pictures in a wide range of conditions:- this camera does not take indoor shots well, especially at night;- I prefer to set ISO at 100 to obtain crisp pictures -- high ISO readings, which come up if you use iA settings at night outdoors are very grainy and disappointing- outdoor daylight pictures are excellent and iA (with relevant scene settings) can be very effective (eg, sunset setting when shooting into the sun; action setting for movement)- I edit most fotos on the computer; nearly always have to increase brightness and contrast to obtain crisp picture- that 16 mega pixel is overkill - I get grainier pics and never use this setting (3M or 5M is more than adequate)- colour balance is not quite up to my old Fujifilm finepix 2800 (brilliant sharp color fotos!) -- fair to say it did have a larger lens though- never thought I'd appreciate the wide angle lens as much until I compared with my older standard camera- takes terrific burst pics (daylight)- super video so long as you are not pointing toward the sun over water- battery life better than expectedOVERALL: I expected a little better colour balance and flexibility in dark/indoor lighting; outdoor night shots are very lmited unless closeup with manual ISO 100 setting; however, this camera has been used extensively and never missed a beat (always carry a charged spare battery).

Nice if you know you'll only capture for 4x6\" or screen (only 5MP is required), and you can zoom in much more.5) Light!  Almost too light for the size. At first, you think the battery is missing, but it's actually quite nice once you realize that's it.

I have to admit, this is not the first time I've been heavily influenced to choose a particular electronic device because it was purple, and last time it was a really bad choice, but this time I got the camera and I took it to the tulip festival and everyone admired my pictures quite a bit and I was happy. I was also pretty happy playing with this camera at home - it does much better in low light conditions than my old camera and has good anti-blur and good zoom...I was able to zoom in on some fabric across the room, in low light, and with my maraca hands and the picture I took was very clear with lots of color and you could see the individual threads! So I was happy.Happy for a few months.Until...I ended up with another camera. I was sent a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 to review and it costs a little bit more than the Lumix and it's 18.2mp with more zoom and more features in general but I was really ready to not be impressed (besides, it was blue, not purple!) But when I started playing with both cameras side by side, I became very impressed with the Cybershot and this Lumix just didn't measure up. When I was looking for a camera a few months earlier, I was confused by all the choices and it didn't seem like it was worth (my boyfriend) paying a little more just to get a few more features or a few more mega pixels, but actually the Cybershot is totally worth it (even if it was my own money.) I took them up to wine country for a bike ride, and gave the Lumix to my boyfriend to take pictures while I used the Cybershot. That gives the Cybershot a disadvantage, since I have \"maraca\" hands and he has a very steady hand. The Cybershot wins every single time, though. When we both zoomed in on a lizard on a patio and later on a crow in a row of grapevines, the Cybershot had the clearer image, hands down. Even just the fact that it was very bright and sunny out...the Cybershot got more detail and depth in every outdoor blazing-with-light scene. Also, the anti-blur feature on that camera is amazing.The Cybershot is also better in terms of basic design...like for one thing, you can charge the camera simply by attaching it via USB to your computer. The Lumix forces you to open the flimsy door on the bottom, take the battery out and put it in the little battery charger. I could go on, but I'll save it for the Cybershot review.So basically, is this Lumix a decent camera? Yes. Does it come in purple? YES!!! YAY!!!!

I am a retired photography teacher, also have a nice Kodak z-series point & shoot, and a Canon Xsi dSLR. Bought this to have a nice pocket camera to carry. Setup was easy, there are plenty of options, features, and modes. But most owners will probably use it in the \"intelligent auto\" mode where the camera figures everything. It has a high quality Leica lens. I am amazed at how close I can shoot, without using the zoom, and even with the flash firing. This camera just came out in January, 2011, so the required lithium-ion rechargeable battery is expensive at $49.95 at this time. Generics will not work, I have read, because like many companies, the battery contains a computer chip which tells the camera if the battery is legit, sorry. I'm sure prices will come down on the battery, and a second battery is not needed, at least at first. It takes very high quality pictures. You can adjust settings, but even at the best image quality setting this takes over 1200 images to an 8GB SD memory card. A Class 6 is recommended if you plan to shoot HD 720 video. I highly recommend this camera. UPDATE: Months later I am still very happy with this camera. In fact, I tend to use it most often of the 3 good digital cameras I own. I mainly like its small size which can be slipped into a pocket in a thin camera pouch, and automatically great pictures. One thing I have noticed, and that is sometimes floating dust in the shot will end up as a round circle in the picture. This does not happen often, usually only happens in lightly dusty areas, and according to the company is normal. There's nothing really wrong with the camera. I can live with it, and dust spots like these can be corrected using photo software most of us have. Additional UPDATE 12/2011: I still love this camera but have had one additional problem. Sometimes when I take flash pictures in a darker area, or of a dark object, i.e. mens suit, the black does not photograph as black. It has \"noise\" made up of multiple color pixels. This does not happen often, and I think it may be a problem of the flash. It doesn't perform like my Canon digital Rebel XSi, though, but it's a much simpler camera, small, and very easy to use.

I blame this on my lack of experience and NOT reading the manual.Charging- It has one of those flip plug chargers where the plugs that go into the outlet snap in when not in use and out when you need to plug it in. This is a bonus because the prongs will not get bent up when you storage it.The battery- Takes a few hours like most rechargeable things to take charge. I get a good few uses and a couple of hours each time. I have only had to charge it 2 times since I purchased it, but I do not sit there and spend all day taking photos either so I can't really give a specific time frame.This is definitely a very cool little camera for anyone who wants one that can do a little bit of everything for not a big price.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Armando Jose Rojas Moreira", "ReviewID": "R1GNS6KGTOV74K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

I've always liked the build quality and great pics that the Lumix family of cameras provide.  What sold me were all the stellar reviews on Amazon, the Leica lens, and the rock bottom pricing ($139 a few weeks ago).The camera feels light in your hand- almost too light.  Not sure if the body is made of metal or plastic, but it's small enough to pocket if you had to.  I'd prefer to place it in a belt looped case for added protection.  It might be a tiny bit longer and wider than a standard deck of playing cards.  What warrants the 5 star rating from me?  What should always matter the most with cameras - picture quality.  I made a few basic settings once I got the camera in the mail - highest picture quality, vivid color setting, anti-shake setting 'on'.  I popped in the battery after it was fully charged (about 90 minutes), and a new 8gb class 10 SDHC card.After heading to the wilderness of the backyard, I snapped all the familiar images I always seem to shoot when testing out a new camera.  Flowers, textures, any stray bugs or birds that might be out.  I always take a few shots in the shade, the direct sunlight, macro, as well as zoomed shots.  The Lumix FH25 delivered in spades.  Shots were HUGE on my monitor - I was very pleased with the sharpness, contrast, and color saturation in all of the test shots.  Detail on some of the flower shots were amazing - gentle textures on the structures within the flower were razor sharp.  Focusing is fast, so I doubt you'd ever have to blame the FH25 for a missed shot.I've only just started to explore all the various shooting modes- just sticking to the basic shooting mode or the Ai mode for now.  If you're looking for a quality camera with a lens everyone knows as one of the very best, search no more.  The Lumix FH25k delivers.

The battery drains faster with movies so it's nice to have an extra; I also bought the Wasabi Power battery set (comes with two batteries) which is compatible with the camera.Three negatives I can think of are:-Taking pictures in high light often brings out reflections...the flash is blindingly bright as well-Taking pictures in low light can result in grainy pictures...you'll need some ambient light to avoid this-No zoom in movie mode - the camera automatically focuses on things, but if they're far away you can't zoom in", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this camera", "Author": "Rose", "ReviewID": "RM84RQHZD4PR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera as a replacement for my Kodak Easyshare Z8612 that I absolutely hated.

It seemed to make a difference in some situations.I was very disappointed with the battery life. I was only able to get approximately 60% of the expected life. I believe that this was because I reviewed and deleted photos regularly. BEWARE, you are burning battery life every time you play with the photos. The battery strength display is deceptive. The battery did not last long once it quit showing full strength. Panasonic needs to sell their batteries for a reasonable price.

On paper, the Panasonic DMC-FH25S has all of those, and a Leica lens, too.I do want to mention that the lack of a super macro mode is disappointing, but something I was willing to live with. Considering that one of the things I often take pictures of are flowers and other plants in close-up, that is saying a lot about how impressed I was with the specs of this camera.What I have found in a few months of working with this camera is that it is nigh unto impossible to be sure what the camera is thinking at any given time, and as a result  there are many blurred shots, or missed shots simply because the camera is still thinking about the shot, instead of reacting when you press the button.I have been taking pictures for 30 years, and I understand the trade-offs in size and quality very well.

As I've learned in the last 24 hours this is a common problem with point-and-shoot digital cameras, though somehow it's one I haven't suffered with my long-in-the-tooth Canon PowerShot SD800 IS, which I've used without incident for 6 or 7 years.The bottom line is that the camera is now unusable.  I've had *some* success cleaning out the spaces between the various telescoping lens elements, but I can't get the camera to start up reliably -- even when the lens appears to extend fully.  And frankly I'm not surprised, because the first time I held the camera I found it suspiciously light ... and one reason undoubtedly is the set of cheap plastic cylinders within cylinders that hold the zoom lens elements in place and allow them to telescope and retract.Of course, the problem from here on out is how to shop for a point-and-shoot camera that *won't* exhibit this common problem.  In all the camera reviews I've read on Amazon I rarely encounter one that cites this issue -- usually people complain about more basic problems, such as suddenly finding themselves unable to turn on the camera.  And no camera maker is going to flaunt the reliability of its zoom lens motor system.  At least, I can't *ever* recall reading such a claim from the usual suspects: Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.In any case, consider yourself warned if you're seriously thinking about buying this camera new or used.

That's when I started shopping around and decided to buy this Panasonic FH25k.I have had it for a year and a half now I believe and overall I am very happy with it.  In outdoor lighting, it gives wonderful pictures with vibrant colors.  I take it to the park all the time and I get great action shot of my son riding bugs and playing.  I have also gotten some nice indoor pictures when the lighting is good (lot of sun coming through the windows).  When the lighting isn't good, the flash works well enough to capture the moment.  Without flash, I have gotten some blurry pictures of my now toddler running around.  It is a tad slow too in indoor light, but not so slow that I have really missed anything.  For a point and shoot I think it is great.  I have used other point and shoots and was never happy with them.  I have taken some videos too, and they look pretty good on the computer screen.

I've had good luck with the Panasonic brand.This FH25 will take pictures right out of the box after charging and inserting battery. It has a large, bright, beautiful LED screen.I am a complete beginner having only used an inexpensive cell phone which barely took a picture.Reading the manual supplied on the CD is to learn a new language: written in Chinese, then translated by a British-learned translator, then spell checked. It does not read intuitively.This is OK because I set it to \"automatic intelligence\", and it takes GREAT PICS.Made in China. No case, no extra battery, no ac adapter or memory card included. The internal memory can take pictures so you don't absolutely need this stuff. But, you will probably want them soon after purchase. No tape on packaging so it's hard to tell if it's new, used or refurbished.$150 for the camera, I also ordered a 16GB card and extra Battery for another $20.Update 8/21/12: Now that I have spent 5 hours playing around with some its other features I'm amazed at this little thing's capabilities. I think it's a great value.Tip: when connecting to computer: 1. Connect cord, 2. Turn on camera, 3. press set button. To disconnect: 1. safe to remove hardware command, 2. Turn off camera, 3. remove cord.

I know ive only had this a few hours so I cant exactly review its durability but I dont think it will be a problem, seems better built then the cybershot and just taking the first few pics I was blown away with the quality of the pictures! They are so crisp and clear with soooo much detail. This is so important to me b/c I am always taking pics of my kids. A big problem I noticed with the cybershots is that if you moved ever so slightly the pic would come out blurry. I also bought this b/c it has the shake detection and what a difference! During and after my daughters delivery we took a lot of pics with the cybershot and so many of them came out so fuzzy that we had to erase them. I SO wish I had this camera b/c then I wouldnt have had to miss out on so many pics on such a memorable day. I HIGHLY recommened this camera.

She was thrilled with its performance, and lots of her team members were impressed by its results.Our daughter is not an experienced photographer, so she left it in i-Auto (? - I think that is the term) most of the time.  By and large the photos were very good to excellent.  She sometimes used the eZoom button, which uses the full optical zoom plus digital zoom.  The photos in this mode were not as good, but at least she captured the target.  When using the eZoom mode, the contrast dropped a good bit and more noise was present.  I believe a good post-processing software package can make many of these photos even better.So I highly recommend this camera as an excellent value.

We use it a lot for taking product pictures for our business, and in that role it is perfectly fine.  It also has a good zoom, and the default picture settings work well in most situations.However, as a general use/travel camera it is inconvenient.First of all, it uses a proprietary USB cable to connect to a computer.  In this day and age of plug-and-play compatibility, this is just ridiculous.  Also, the battery does not charge via the USB cable, another ridiculous limitation.Secondly, this camera uses a rechargeable battery, so if you are traveling with just the camera and the battery runs low, you can't just pop in some AA or AAA batteries from the store and keep going.  You have to have remembered to bring the charger, have access to a plug, and have the time to wait for the battery to recharge.  Or, you have to bring spare batteries, but here again Panasonic has taken the low road with tremendously overpriced spare batteries.The one bit of good news is that the Wasabi batteries and charger kit work well.  The kit comes with two batteries, a charger, a car adapter, and a European plug adapter, all for less than just a Panasonic-branded battery.  Oh, and the Wasabi batteries are 1100mAh, compared with the Panasonic batteries, which are 660mAh, so each Wasabi battery gives almost double the life of a Panasonic battery.  Note that the camera manual states that using other brands of batteries can damage the camera, but I've had no problems with the Wasabis.So, when we use this for taking product pictures for our business, this camera is great.  We're at home, have access to a plug, spare batteries, and the time to wait if we need a recharge, as we won't miss anything.  We are also near the proprietary cable and/or have access to computers with card readers, so getting the pictures off the camera is possible, if not necessarily convenient.But when traveling?  Not good.  Got the camera?  Check.  Got the charger?  Check.  Got a spare battery?  Check.  Got the proprietary USB cable?  Check.  We end up taking our older, crappier camera because it uses AA batteries, and we can transfer photos using a 'normal' USB cable that we use to charge our other devices.We would not buy this camera again, as we're eventually going to break down and get an additional camera to use when traveling that isn't so inconvenient and gear intensive.

One of the big DSLR companies did a study of their customers and discovered that more than half never removed the lens from the camera, didn't own any other lenses, and didn't even know how to take the lens off the camera.  But they thought they would get better photos by spending four times the money and carrying around a big heavy camera.  Wrong.

He had been unemployed for two years and had to sell his old one in order to help keep current on his bills.  Last week, he emailed me photos of my grandsons, who I don't get to see nearly enough, and I felt it was a gift for me, as well as for him.  The pictures were so clear they almost jumped out at me.  He also took a picture of a lake near where he lives.  It was magnificant and captured water color variations, the sun, the mist.  He is having it put on photo quality paper and framing it for me.  I doubt another camera would give such great results.  And, it was quite affordable.Check it out for yourself :http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NBZ8DQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the money!", "Author": "Carolina Torres", "ReviewID": "R27P9QFDVNMNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera mostly because of the high mega pixels and it's small size.

I recently took some closeups of flowers in my yard. When I downloaded the pictures to my pc, I could not believe how clear, crisp and vivid the picture was. I saw a lady bug on a flower which I had not seen with the naked eye. Because of it's high mega pixels you can get your pictures made into posters without losing any color, clarity or vividness.

On my last trip abroad, I managed to drop it onto a tiled patio and \"pfft!\" there goes the Elph.I read a number of reviews on affordable compact point-and-shoot cameras, and what it boiled to was either get another Canon or try out the Panasonic LUMIX FH25. I decided on the Panasonic this time mostly because of the favorable reviews on its zoom capabilities.I have only had the camera for a week, but I am very pleased with the results.  The iA mode provides very good results if you are unsure of what settings to choose, and I really like the ease of changing exposure on the fly. It also has very good stabilization. I am very much looking forward to taking this little bugger on an upcoming trip to US parks Craters of the Moon (ID), Yellowstone (WY), and Garden of the Gods (CO) and really running it through its paces!My two greatest praises: 1) It has WONDERFUL color saturation and loves to play up shadows. This bodes very well for outdoor shots. 2) The price point is great for the quality of camera.My two biggest complaints: 1) Thus far it's the fact that the software which arrived with the camera is just plain lame. 2) The flash is very powerful, more powerful than the one I was used to with my Canon.  This has the undesired effect of washing subjects' faces out a bit indoors. I guess I shouldn't really call that a complaint, since a bright flash is better than a weak one.

It isn't too heavy and is ok in a shirt pocket or back pocket providing you remember it is there.There are though many smaller cameras if that is an issue but very few if any with all these features and 16mp.

I don't think I took too many blurry pictures when I took the time to setup the shot and allow the auto focus to focus.Cons:Didn't like the pictures taken indoors in moderate to low lighting. lots of static. I've added a couple of pictures to the gallery, one indoor and one outdoor mountain scene.Overall impression, good camera for the price, good features, fast. This is definitely a solid point and shoot for well lit shots, I probably could have tweaked and dialed in the settings to allow for better indoor pictures.I've ordered a canon ELPH 500 for about $25 more, this particular canon may not be around much longer as it has been replaced with a new model.

It was priced very reasonably and is still what I consider to be best-in-class for inexpensive digital cameras.Here's why it was priced so reasonably:Shipping from the original order was slow but not terrible - we ordered three things from three different US-based Amazon merchants and this was the last to arrive by two full business days, taking 7 business days. The camera looked unused BUT it was clearly an open box item, and it was advertised as new. The charger included with the camera didn't fit the battery (and the battery fit the camera, so the charger was obviously wrong) so I contacted the seller (Tek Depot) for a replacement charger. They apologized and said they would be shipping a new charger. At this point they were still on track for a 4/5 star review at worst. I understand things can sometimes be confused at the point of shipping. However, a full 8 days later we had not received any charger or any notification of shipping (or delay), so I contacted them again and asked when it would be delivered. They replied that they had JUST ordered it, that it would be coming directly from the manufacturer, and they would be contacting me again when they had a tracking number for me. Eight days to process a replacement charger seems ridiculous to me. So we waited. And waited. Two more days later, I still had no tracking number and no communication, so again I contacted them and asked for my tracking number. Their reply was that it had been shipped USPS and therefore would have no tracking number. Regular mail after almost three weeks of having an inoperable camera? Inexcusable. We finally received the replacement charger - and it's a knockoff from China. (It works, but it isn't what they said they were having shipped.)

I also wanted to spend some time looking over the manual, take some test shots and make some comparisons. As I suspected, however, the latter (and now sadly the former) never happened.Shutter speed, even on burst mode, is terrible. Almost every shot that had any movement was blurry. Low lighting shots the same. The amount of time between pressing the shoot button and the flash/taking picture event was LONG. Most of the time my subject had already left the picture.My third problem with this camera is the extended zoom. The button for it is on the top right right next to the photo taking one. I'd be taking a photo and all of a sudden, it would do a crazy super zoom because it's pretty difficult to keep your finger away from that spot. Forget trying to hold it with one hand. Getting it back to where I wanted it took far longer than my subjects allowed for photo ops.One last thing I noticed which I have never experienced with any other camera (even my big fat SLR lenses) is that this camera appears to be a dust magnet. I am constantly having to remove dust from the lens. I wasn't taking photos in a dust storm. Is it getting in there when it is closed?!In summary, if you plan on taking pictures of immobile subjects, while standing perfectly still (never on a boat; even a stable, slow-moving one), then this may be the camera for you.I included a sample of photos.

For those 4 years that blue little Lumix served me well; it survived all that time in great working condition before finally succumbing when I dropped it one too many times (and believe me, I dropped it constantly; I'm surprised it held up for so long). After briefly trying out a new brand of camera that I sent back with disgust, I decided to return to the old & trusty brand that had worked so well before. And boy, am I glad I did!This beautiful, updated model seems to be (so far) just as perfect as it's predecessor, for many reasons:1) It is the PERFECT portable size to fit in a purse, backpack or even the pocket of your jeans.2) Beautiful color and and design.3) User-friendly interface for changing modes, turning flash on/off, deleting pictures, and every other function you might need.4) Gorgeous picture quality. When taking a photo of my dog, for example, you can see just how luscious and luminescent her fur is, and the gleam in her eyes is clear and crisp. In sum, the photos it takes look great, which leads me to:5) Very flattering picture quality as well! (it must be the flash; either way my skin looks a whole lot better on camera than it does in the mirror!)6) Easy to use buttons/toggles for zoom, taking a picture, turning on/off, deleting, etc. This comes in handy when asking a third party to take a group photo (there's no long struggle trying to find out how to work  the camera).7) It's SO simple to charge (just plug the battery into the charging unit, into the wall, and you're good to go; it's also very easy to remove and replace the battery as well).8) It's easy to upload photos with the simple, no-confusion USB cord (clearly delineates between which end goes in the camera and which goes into the port, which has been a problem with some other devices I own).9) Durability. At least if this model is as sturdy as my last, it will tolerate quite a few tumbles and still looks beautiful despite the scrapes, while never downgrading the quality of the camera itself.10) Simple setup. There's no confusion in setting the time/date, or turning down the volume, etc etc.Suffice to say I'm in love with this little device. Not only is it sleek & nice to look at, but it produces great quality photos/videos and is easy to use as well. I'd recommend it to ANYONE, literally, whether you're looking for a camera to take landscape pictures on vacation, portraits of family members or pets, or self-portraits. It's an all-around, great camera, and the best I've EVER seen to date (certainly out performs all my friends and family members cameras at group occasions!).

It is not at all complicated and has lots of different options. I try to take pictures on horseback, and can easily work with the camera while moving. On auto most of the shots were REALLY nice... beautiful shots, I have some that look professional. A few of the shots under auto were fuzzy... you have to be patient and wait a little for the camera to figure out what it needs to focus on under this option. I imagine that the camera was adjusting since I was moving when I took the shot. If you need to take a quick shot of something fast, use normal view or if you want to chose a specific photo option, your target for the photo might move by the time you flip through a couple screens to chose face, animal, candle light, etc as the specific type of photo you want. This is true of most cameras though... and like I said, it is easy to find what you need. I tried video and shots of a deer under regular and night.. with my porch light on it. I could see the deer but the camera couldn't even when I messed with different options. Some pictures under certain options showed the deer some... but not that well at all, I was disappointed with this. The camera has been durable for the month I have had it so far, and the software was easy to use as well.  As far as amazon goes, they sent me an e-mail to pick up the camera at the post office as it needed to be signed for... but it showed up the next day via mail and was left in my mail box.

Generally with other cameras if you take a picture in dark with flash on, the things close by become bright and you get an almost black background.

A point and shoot for me must take great pics on the auto setting, I don't want to have to fiddle with the adjustments because pics are usually taken quickly and on the go, thats the whole purpose of a point and shoot.

I was very happy with how such nice optics fit in such a small package.  A few weeks ago, I noticed that the flash wasn't working and the mode indicator dial wouldn't always register the correct position.  Since the camera was still under warranty, I sent it in for repairs.I got a call from Panasonic a week later telling me that the warranty was void because of a small dent on the camera's mode indicator dial, and since the dent was in one of my problem areas, they claimed the warranty was void.  There was no dent when I sent the camera in for repairs.Panasonic said that it is their policy to keep the packaging of any package which looks like it was damaged in shipping.  They did not keep the packaging for my camera, since it had shown no signs of damage.  I talked to a number of people at the post office, and they also had no record of damage.  The only logical conclusion left was that the camera was damaged at Panasonic's repair facility.Panasonic, of course, insists they do not damage cameras, and that it is not possible for a camera to be even accidentally damaged at their facility.  They told me several times they would have a manager call me back to speak to me about the situation.  No one ever did.  Every time I called again, I was told the manager was unavailable.  I got no help from anyone at their support center.  I only got brushed off.My camera had no dent when I sent it in.  It was sitting untouched on a table between the last time I used it and the time I noticed it was malfunctioning.  Panasonic treated my camera negligently at their facility. Now they want to charge me more than the cost of the camera to have it repaired, when it should still be under warranty.Panasonic sold me an unreliable product, damaged it further instead of repairing it, and gave me terrible customer service.

There are lots of settings on this and probably too many because it gets confusing.  Also few of them work well.  I did get decent results from using the candlelight setting and the pet setting but not many of the others. Also the stabilizer works well. None of my recent photos have been blurry.  However, the photos are never consistent.  I can take 2 or 3 shots of the same thing in the same place at the same time and each one will have a different look (mostly brightness). Also, the battery door is very flimsy and I am afraid it will break soon.Overall I would not purchase this camera again for my needs but for a basic user it would probably be fine.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Did not last", "Author": "K.

The interface is simple and straight forward, and it gives you descriptions of each function along the way.  Focus is excellent and fast compared to my old camera, as well as the zoom feature which is pretty powerful for such a small camera.  Picture quality is decent and images almost always come out sharp.  Taking pics in extremely low light conditions may require an adjustment or two since they sometimes look grainy.My only real complaint is video mode.  24 frames per second in HD mode is pretty low compared to the cheap Flip HD 60 frames per second.  I recorded part of a TV program on my plasma as well as video game clips and it had a flicker in HD mode, whereas in SD mode with 30 frames per second it looked perfect. I'm not sure why they couldn't have made HD mode at least 30 fps.  Also, as others mentioned, you can't zoom in or out while shooting video.  If you're looking for this feature with higher frames per second, look into one of the higher end Canon point and shoot models.  They're a little more expensive, but I sort of wish I spent the extra money for these features alone.  It still won't replace a good camcorder, but it's nice to have an efficient all in one device.This camera also doesn't include video editing software like Flip cameras where you can shorten or splice clips.  It says Super LoiLoScope is on the CD, but it's only a link to purchase the software for 70 bucks!  I found it bizarre and ridiculous to feature the software's name on the CD if it's only a link to download and pay for it.Bottom line, if you only have a $150 budget or less to spend on a camera and need something simple and effective, this is a good buy.

The first thing I have to say is that 16 megapixels is way to much for the modern sensors to cope with unless you are buying a much more expensive machine with a large CMOS sensor. The FH25's Venus engine overprocesses  and oversaturates every shot. Bleeding and fuzziness toward the edges are noticable on anything over a 5x7\" print. Anything over 200iso  will give you a blurry and unusable print.In bright sunlight the camera produces good enough photos for up to a 5x7\" enlargement but if the sun goes in results are barely acceptable.

Movie quality is decent as long as there is enough lighting, the camera doesn't provide any for movies. It does still adjust for too much light in movies though, and very well although it has a slight delay.The sensor size is a bit small, but it is the same as all pocket cameras in this price range. You can't adjust zoom while shooting a movie clip. Also flash will basically always go off indoors when on auto, even if there is plenty of light and the flash will just make it look worse. You basically have to manually set it off if you want it off indoors, which is easy to do but still annoying. iISO is nice, but doesn't always use the best option indoors. Sometimes it will use 800 and the picture will look too bright from flash, and then when manually set to 400 the same picture will look perfect.If you don't need to zoom while taking movies then this is a great choice.

The flash seems very underpowered, which may well contribute to these odd results.  Other shots looked quite dim and out of balance.As far as build quality goes, I cannot understand why Panasonic would give the camera such a flimsy battery/SD card door.

The two Canons and Nikon I've previously owned in compact digital cameras had either metal braces or were intentionally made of a flexible rubbery plastic that had some give to it.  The Panasonic camera, which is very light, just doesn't feel like it will hold up well over time and use.Maybe others will find virtues in this camera, but I, for one, didn't find a whole lot to like.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Colors are OFF - sent it back", "Author": "istkrieg", "ReviewID": "R2WREH2YOLW6RA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was time to replace our 5-year old Sony 7.2 MP camera, so, after reading through tons of reviews, I decided to get this Panasonic product. A combination of features, positive reviews and price seemed unbeatable. Well, we really wanted to love this camera, but it just wasn't meant to be. Our main and pretty much the only issue with this camera is that the colors on the pictures just look way off. We tried Intelligent Auto first, in the variety of settings, and the pictures just didn't look right. What you see in reality (colorwise) is not what you get when you take a picture with this camera. Since Auto mode pretty much failed, I then played with different settings to try and find a good combination. Still no luck. Kept comparing colors to the ones on the pictures by our old Sony and Panasonic was beat time, after time, after time. As others have already mentioned, good P&S; cameras will take good pictures in the Auto mode without you having to mess around with settings every time you are in the new surroundings. This camera is not only incapable of that, it can't even take decent pictures when manual settings are used. I'm not a photo professional, but both my wife and I could easily see the difference between our old pictures taken by Sony and the ones taken by this Panasonic camera.

Not good!2) Proprietary battery.. Yup, always out of charge, and hunting for the charger. What happened to using AA batteries, where you never find yourself out of batteries?  Get with it guys.Those two annoyances are enough to tell people to steer clear of this camera.. It's OK for point and shoot, but those annoyances will rapidly catch up, and drive you away. My advice to people is to FIND the Kodak Point and Shoot's before they are all gone. Specifically the Easyshare 1550 is remarkable, 16mp, 5x Zoom, Android Cables, AA Batteries. 1530 is OK but only 3x Zoom, but same as 1550 overall.

Trying to go on the cheap while buying a name brand in Panasonic got me nowhere... do your research first... pay more for what you want or you will be disappointed like I was... 16mp means nothing... it's just the camera makers showing off... look at how many mega-pixels we can cram in this little thing.. but it's not important.. during my research I found a camera that last year was a 14mp camera and this years model they went down to 12mp.. why? because 14mp is to much for the lens.. if you want to print at 14mp you cant and have to downgrade the file in the computer anyway.. so why bother?... the camera I am looking seriously at is the Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 (2011). it's $270.. that is more than I wanted to pay.. but if your above average photographer you need to pay more for a better camera.. this Panasonic has zero pros for me... I am sorry I bought it and thought 16mp is all that matters... then why did Kodak go down in mega-pixels? Think before you buy.

Before my DMC-FH3 broke, see below, I was very satisfied with the quality of the images.Update: Panasonic CS called me wanting to correct the mistake and replace the Pink camera for a Black model. I must credit them for stepping up. I had already purchased a new camera and the Pink model is already planned as a gift.I am looking to replace a DMC-FH3 with this model.But hesitant to purchase another Panasonic camera after my recent exchange experience.Overall I have always been satisfied with Panasonic products up until my recent camera exchange.Panasonic has a very poor exchange policy. You get a Refurbished Camera, Not necessarily the same model or color. You also pay for freight to ship it to Texas.--------------Panasonic Product Exchange Notice --------------In accordance with your model's warranty coverage, your product will be exchanged instead of repaired.  The exchange model will vary depending on availability, and will be of the same, similar, or comparable model in a factory remanufactured condition.  Color match is not guaranteed, and will depend on availability.My DMC-FH3K broke after just a few months.  The lens would no longer retract fully into the camera body the majority of the time, and had to be coaxed by repeatedly turning on and off. It also displayed an Error message saying to turn the camera off then back on again to resume.I sent my Black camera into the Panasonic McAllen TX Exchange Center and received back a Refurbished Pink DMC-FH3P (as in Pink) camera.  Seriously, a Pink camera to replace a Black model???I had even sent a cover letter with Bold Type stating \"Please replace with another Black (in color) model camera\", which they ignored, or perhaps sent Pink as a sick joke.On the Plus side.  I now have a Refurbished Pink camera to give as a graduation present to a young niece.But now I need to purchase a new camera.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery/SD Card Door hinge broken", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Gadget Saint\"", "ReviewID": "R2TW5D0ZBWU8SH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to do much with this camera. The battery compartment door hinge shipped broken and I decide to return it. The door hinge is made very cheaply with what looks like two narrow hoops of soft plastic. Considering the lens brand and the fact the solid construction of the body, why would Panasonic skimp on the quality in a high-traffic part of the camera? It makes no sense.I wasn't expecting miracles from a $150 point and shoot and the camera actually looks feature rich.  I ended up buying a FinePix (Fujufilm's version of the Coolpix line) 14MP/10X for $139 at Walmart and returning the Panasonic for a refund. Definitely not as many picture mode options, but excellent ISO range and 10x optical zoom with HD video capability? Oh, and the door hinge is made of metal, not two plastic loops.

What's with Panasonic.  Make cameras to sell batteries?! Like HP with ink cartridges.  I really hate that kind of marketing.  Why so expensive?  Probably my last Panasonic because of that.  Or at least make 1 kind of battery that fits all.And where is my case?! No case with this one either.  I had a difficult time finding what exactly was going to ship with the camera.  Glad it at least came with a battery.  I should be able to use any battery that meets the electronic specs. It's just a battery!  Too bad Panasonic.  Did the seller, Quality Photo, remove the case?

And despite the marketing, this is not a good low light camera.After we decided to upgrade our 4 yr old Cannon Digital Elph SD1000, I thought that I could go by the reviews on Amazon. I was deciding between the this $150 Panasonic with 4.5 stars and a $330 Cannon S95 which also has 4.5 stars.  I figured if they have the same ratings, they must be fairly comparable.  Well, I think I was wrong. When I received the Panasonic, I immediately compared the low light pictures with my old SD1000.  The SD1000 low light picture quality was much better.  Besides that, the whole feel of the camera just seemed lower quality vs. a Cannon.  So I decided to return this Panasonic and spend the $330 for the Cannon S95.  I haven't received the S95 yet, but will update this review when I do.Bottom line is you can't compare a 4.5 rated $330 camera, with a 4.5 rated $150 camera.  People purchasing a $330 camera are expecting a much higher level of quality vs. people that purchase a $150 camera.  Those expectations means a 4.5 rating for a $150 camera is actually much lower vs. a 4.5 rating for a $300.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pictures will not load up", "Author": "Eric Parton", "ReviewID": "R1718DLK8WF5WC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible camera.
