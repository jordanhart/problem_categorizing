She was disappointed because you couldn't see the pictures after you took them and you couldn't delete pictures as you took them.  I think this would be best suited for about a 3 or 4 year old that just wants to take pictures.  As high tech as kids are today, they expect alot from a digital camera and this one did not deliver.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Terrible!", "Author": "S. Boswell", "ReviewID": "RPLSQWDMRU5Y0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just got this camera for my seven year old daughter and it was the biggest waste of money I ever spent.  According to the box it came in, it holds between 80 (high res.) and 273 (low res.) pictures but the camera absolutely will not take more than 5 pictures.  It keeps coming up with error codes that won't even completely show up and takes blurry lowsy pictures.  If a negative amount of stars was possible, I would have chosen that for the rating.  This is just awful.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Go photo Easy Pix 30", "Author": "Mike Molloy", "ReviewID": "R36IYZ3IIHNM6H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera didn't work from the time I got it out of the package.

A mattel toy camera is better quality than this bubble gum machine camera!  Was so dissappointed when I opened the case for this camera, returning it was more trouble and $ than it was worth.
