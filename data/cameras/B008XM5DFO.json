Fowler \"du doch nicht!\"", "ReviewID": "R12DFA42V6Z61M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When shopping for the \"right\" camera, it is impossible to pick your next \"perfect\" instrument by reading reviews/opinions/heresay, etc., one must simply use the camera, in actual situations to really see how all turns out.  I am very pleased with my Samsung WB100, but must confess that there is sooooo much to learn about it's quirks/tweaks that a full review is, thusfar, not my intention here.  The 26x is stunning, but remember to use OIS, Optical Image Stabilizer.  Another piece of information to remember (!) in the video mode:  while filming with sound recording, do NOT zoom in on a subject because the audio does NOT record.  Why is this important to me?  This camera was purchased to use for our daughters' PhD Psychology hooding ceremony, AND, due to this operator's error, I zoomed as she was walking up the steps to the stage, and as they were introducing Dr. - - -, having attained this over a 6 year study period, the zoom did not record her name.  Devistated? YES....fault of the Samsung? Not at all.  Bottom line; read and understand all the Owners Manual (had to download a .pdf file for this, it is not included) tips and \"how to's\".  Great camera? Yes... Important for said user to read with understanding?  YES.  Oh, yes, one last thing:  the batteries (4 AA's), even though they are Duracell Ultra Power MX 1500's do NOT last long at all.  Having shot only 73 pictures and roughly 10 minutes of video, the batteries needed changing....carry spare ones in you bag!Enjoy, this camera is worth every penny paid.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung makes a great camera!", "Author": "Daniel E.

I almost didn't buy this; I had to return a defective Nikon S3500 and for another $20 I exchanged it for this Samsung.Samsung is not a brand name high on the list of optical tools (as far as I know!) . . . yet. If they can continue to outmatch part for part and feature for feature, the best known brands in cameras best not rest on their laurels and the weight of their name only.I bought this to use as a camera, not a camcorder. Having said this, when I used the movie function, I discovered that the audio cuts out if the zoom (in or out) is active while 'filming' (funny word for a digital medium).For photographic purposes, I have all I wanted - and more - with Samsung's WB100, and for an excellent price.

Portraits and close-ups are fine, but that is all.  I regret purchasing the camera and would not recommend it.I was MOST unhappy with the packaging of the item. The wrapping was only partially inflated - a very small portion - and it was not packed properly.  The box was ripped, bent and crushed.  When I questioned the carrier (& showed her photos of the packaging), I was told the box needed to be firmly packed to avoid the crushing that occurred.  I also emailed the company very early the morning after I placed the order requesting a change in shipping, but did not receive a response until the next day, at which time I was told it was too late to make a change.

The video had to be right on top of the person or was blur and had a loud noise the whole time during playback to the point that I could not hear the person .  Three days later at the family event, I could not even get the camera to focus. It was all blur. I was so disappointed with this camera so back it went.
