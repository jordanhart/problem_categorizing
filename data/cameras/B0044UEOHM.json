{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Chinese-made junk", "Author": "Alan Smithee", "ReviewID": "R3T0UMRJRPECM2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Why do we keep buying cheap Chinese-made products when our friends and neighbors are out of work and losing their homes?This is strictly consumer-level quality. If you are using it professionally, spend the money on a professional-level monitor that won't let you down in the middle of an important shoot.When it first arrived, I started charging the battery and was puzzled when the charger went to green within minutes. No problem; it must be shipped with the battery fully charged. No such luck. The battery lasted about two minutes. I measured the voltage and it read in millivolts, so I put it back on the charger. Within 5 minutes, the charger had gone to green and it shut down again. I tried leaving it on charge for two days and it never went to red from green and the end voltage ended up lower than when I started. Either the Chinese-made charger or the Chinese-made imitation Canon battery was defective.Sadly, I had a shoot right away and needed a source of power that WORKED, and I needed it right away. (I make my living in the film industry.) I didn't have time to return it to the seller and wait for another one, nor did I relish buying a new Canon battery ($100) or Canon charger ($50) just to find out which was the defective piece.I ended up swapping the battery plate from my Nebtek monitor onto the Marshall and yanking the cheap Chinese-made battery and battery plate right off. I had to drill new holes to mount the plate because I needed a working monitor right away and didn't have time to ship it back and wait for a replacement.The Chinese-made Canon imitation battery  never did work, and this thing became a huge sinkhole of money that I was forced to pour another $100 into just to get a working battery plate that takes Sony batteries and another Sony battery. (Sony camcorder batteries have a MUCH greater capacity than the imitation Canon 5D battery that this monitor ships with.)I delayed writing any reviews until I talked to Marshall, but I have now waited three weeks and they have NOT even replied to my email. THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNACCEPTABLE in this age of instant customer feedback on the internet ... and, Marshall, if you ever read this review - what goes around, comes around. You should have taken the 2 minutes to reply to my email. I will never buy another Marshall product again.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid monitor for the money", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R1F83KYNNI4HJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The strength of this monitor lies not in its picture quality or construction, but mainly in its value.  I purchased this monitor as an accessory to my DSLR for filming video.  The main purpose was to provide a larger screen to help with framing, and to use on a small camera jib.  In this regards the monitor excels.  I had also wanted to use it for help in focusing, and while it is helpful simply to have the larger monitor when focusing, the fact is that this monitor will not display the true HD image pixel for pixel.  To be fair, I was not expecting it to, as a monitor with that resolution is much more expensive.  So if critical focusing is your main goal, and you want a true pixel to pixel image, this probably isn't the monitor for you.  One note in regards to the focus issue: on my GH2, when an external monitor is connected via the HDMI port, the image magnification/focus assist function on the camera is disabled.  So while it is easier to focus with the larger image than the small LCD screen of the camera, the trade off is that the camera's built in focus assist is disabled.  Which goes back to my main point that this monitor is better suited for framing and having a larger image to look at.  When I purchased my Marshall, they were having a special that included a free sun hood, and I have found this to be extremely valuable for outdoor shooting.  I am able to attach the monitor to the back of the jib, away from the camera, and shoot in the sun without glare.  This has made my jib work a lot easier, and this alone is worth the price.  In addition, it comes in a very nice kit with a huge host of accessories: remotes, mounts, cables, chargers, you name it.  This also helps solidify its position as a great value.  Overall, if you're looking for a great starter monitor, or don't require a true HD resolution monitor, this would be a great choice.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good low cost montior", "Author": "ohohmai", "ReviewID": "R3VI831QQAKQIS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good \"entry level\" low cost monitor. Works fine via HDMI with my EOS 7D. There is a reason other Marshall monitors cost a lot more. But if you just need a low cost monitor for use with your video enabled DSLR this is a good pick. Yes the battery and charger are \"knock-off\" grade and probably wont last very long, but you can always use an OEM battery as well. The kit comes with everything you'll need.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good monitor", "Author": "Thiago Rosas", "ReviewID": "R3QARPNU4V25HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very soft, simple and efficient, this monitor allows you to make a better focus with a HD DSLR. And it comes with a lot of useful stuffs, as monitor support, VGA multicable, rechargers, mini-HDMI-HDMI cable, and even... an battery model LP-E6. The main problem is that the battery deck doesn't tie it though enough. Then if you turn the monitor upside down the battery will fall or loose the contact. And a suggestion for Marshall: peaking would be very useful.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Used for 3 times and Now it doesn`t work", "Author": "L.

Yes.", "Author": "caasi101", "ReviewID": "RJ2LM3DELTVCX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought a lot of gear to go with my Canon 7D. I wanted a monitor that was decent and low priced. Also took the LPE6 battery. I would only use this monitor on shots that i absolutely needed a monitor. The quality from the screen on my camera to this is way different. Before every shot I would have to make sure what it looks like on my camera monitor before switching to the Marshall monitor. I would recommend getting a smaller screen Marshall Monitor that has better quality.

I use an external battery with it, which is hooked up to the rig, so I dont have any issues there. My problem is the image quality. I have made several attempts to calibrate it, but no such luck. The image I see isn't close to what the monitor on the back of my DSLR gives, so I use it mainly for framing and focusing, until I can afford a better monitor.

I live abroad and I found this extremely annoying, seeing that my filming session next week is going to be under 55 degree Celsius desert heat, and now I'm worried about the monitor.
