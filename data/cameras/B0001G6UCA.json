{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding Value", "Author": "Maggie's Mom \"School Teacher\"", "ReviewID": "RZZRB220JT3MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony DSC P73 a week ago for $235 at a local retailer. I have an older 2 megapixel Sony digital camera, also, that I have been pleased with.  I wanted this camera because it has a higher resolution than my old camera, and it also has a viewfinder, which was lacking on my 3-year-old camera. After using this camera for a week, I am very happy with my decision to purchase it.  It has many features that make it an outstanding camera for a very low price.I am very pleased with the performance so far.  My pictures have been very crisp and clear.  I like being able to snap pictures rapidly, which is a big improvement over my old Sony. I especially like the zoom feature, which is much improved over my old Sony, whose digital zoom was worthless.  Pictures taken with the digital zoom  on this camera are very clear. I did a close-up of my cat using the digital zoom, and every individual hair can be seen in the photo.  I also tried the macro feature, which allows for close ups as close as 10 inches. I photographed a page of the user's manual, and every word in the photo is clear.I was worried about using rechargable AA batteries, but I have taken many pictures and videos this week, and I have not had to recharge yet. I plan to buy the rapid recharger and two more batteries, so I will always have charged batteries on hand.I loved the video mode on my old camera, so I wanted that feature on the new one.  I haven't tried the fine mode, because I don't have a pro memory stick, yet.  I'm using the 128 mb stick that I used with my other camera. I like being able to record for a longer time than my old camera.  And I also like having the larger image size of 640 x 480 for playback, but I do miss the option of a 320 x 240 image size.  I think that this would allow for longer recording with good playback resolution.  I don't think Sony allows for this option on any of its digital cameras anymore. I also have used the email mode for recording video.  This is great for sending movies to family, or for posting video on web pages, as the file size is small. This camera also has a video editing feature that allows you to delete sections of unwanted video before downloading.  I have found this a very useful feature.Multiple folders can be created in the camera to keep photos of different events separate for ease of organizing for playback or downloading.I installed the Picture Package software that came with the DSC P73, but I probably won't use it.  With it, you can create slide shows, and you can view thumbnails of all your pictures. I can already do this using Windows XP, but I think Windows 98 users would like this software.Overall, I think that this is an excellent camera at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "October 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Overall, a great camera", "Author": "Person \"qazwsx34651\"", "ReviewID": "R2W77M7NZCHCOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As about two or more reviewers got this for the holidays, and so did I. I have to say, this camera is great. I'll just break down pros + cons because it's an electronic devicePROS:- With the 4.1 megapixels, picture and video quality is clear and crisp.- Easy menus.- Overall easy to use if a beginner.- Many different ways and styles to take pictures.- Very durable, as Sony products are mostly all trustful.- Love the zoom in and zoom out features.- Easy to delete videos and pics.- Easy to connect to a computer or a television.CONS:- The memory stick that came with this is only 16MB which is only 8 pictures and 42 secs for video. Luckily, I also got a 256MB memory stick seperatly and I can take about 120 pics and 11 min for video.- The batteries were not charged up when I recived the product.- Sound on the videos are sometimes weak.Overall, this camera is great, but make sure to buy a seperate memory stick or you will only have 42 seconds of fun with the video and only 8 pics.", "Date": "December 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "pretty cool for what you pay", "Author": "ZenSurfer", "ReviewID": "RTVBDZG9R4X8K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought the p73 and I am pretty content with it. altough bulkier than the exilims of casio, I like the fast cycle times between shots, which often caused me to loose nice pictures before with my old digital camera. The video is quite good considering it's just mpeg, and good for those moments when you wished you had brought your camcorder. I am using the mem stick pro 256 meg so there is alot of room for short videos as well as pictures. The preflash works pretty well in low light, an added benefit is that it catches the attention of my baby so all our shots have her looking straight at the camera. I havent tried the more advanced features yet, altough I am saving up for a wide angle lens to attach onto this toy. It is a bit heavy for a small cam, but then I realized that it was the battery which was accounting for much of the weight.", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Everything you might need... and maybe more!", "Author": "M.

It is my first digital camera (and first camera that I have actually bought that you didn't throw away after 24 pictures!) I wanted something that had optical zoom and I could not justify 5 megapixels for my use. In addition I have seen 5 megapixel cameras that took 3 megapixel-quality pictures. Some cameras claim the high megapixel as a selling point but often lack optical zoom (a must), fine tuning to light changes, and just take poor pics. That being said I wanted something that I didn't have to have a degree in photography to take quality pictures. I wanted enough features to play with in case I the urge. I also required durability and a camera that came with a recharger and batteries (otherwise plan on spending $20-$40 more down  the road). Here's the deal:Pros:Great, easy to take pictures.Easy navigation through the menu.Price for value is outstanding. (I paid $200 + 69 dollars for a 512 sandisk card)Sony-like feel in terms of quality (but I've never had a sony ANYTHING fail on me so I am biased)Movie mode is excellent, seems much better than the HP, Vivitar Cannon competition at this price point. Not as good as a a real video camera but still quality sound and video.LCD screen is easy to see in all light conditions and you can even dim it.Did I mention it came with rechargeble batteries and charger?Cons:I realize no cameras come with big memory cards but at least they can give you 32 or 64 mb as charity (instead of less than 10)Software is a little weak. I expected something a little better than paint, but instead it just reads from the software and transfers it to paint for editing.Size, kinda bulky but you have to cut cost somewhere and it is certainly competitive against the competition.USB 1 transfer with camera but I just ordered a USB 2 reader so...Thats it.Overall this a good purchase if you are looking for a reasonably priced camera that will (hopefully) take a little abuse and take great photos. 4.5 rating for the worthless standard memory card.", "Date": "January 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "User Friendly.", "Author": "C.

It has taken nice high-quality pictures, and it was simple enough that even my mother, who is horrible with technology, was able to figure out how to use it to pretty much its fullest potential. I liked the layout of the buttons and the simplicity of the interface.For the price though, it is perfectly natural to expect some gripes. For one, in medium-low light conditions, the LCD is far too dark, and it can be quite difficult to see anything, even if it really isn't that dark out. Secondly, it is a pain not to be able to zoom in or out during filming the movies (though, with the short amount of time offered by memory cards, the movie function is not really meant for significant filming).

I went back to the store and exchanged my nice Kodak for a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P73. What a difference! When I opened the box all items were carefully organized and packaged, the memory stick had its case and lables, even the rechargeable batteries had their own cute plastic case. It also accompanied its battery charger. The shutter button is located in the middle of the mode dial, which is far better than having them in totally different places like the Kodak does. When I first used the Kodak Easyshare I had no idea how to insert the memory card in it, there were no arrows, no diagrams showing what side or end should enter first, I had to refer to the instructions manual. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P73 has drawings or diagrams so I could see how to properly insert the memory stick and batteries. The coolest thing is the sound it makes when you turn it on. The Sony makes a cute Windows XP type of sound when is turned on and a digital camera flashing sound when you take a picture. When I looked at my first pictures using the Kodak Easyshare I thought they were sharp for a 5MP, but when I looked at my 4.1 MP Sony pictures I was blown away by how much sharper they were, and the colors were more vivid. I guess Sony cameras have better lenses. I'm so glad I exchanged that Kodak Easyshare for a Sony, now I can take picture, open the camera, remove the memory stick, stick it into my 40 inch TV and enjoy great digital funny family pictures.Cons:  Couldn't find any.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "E.

I am not at all a sophisticated user, and here is my experience with two cameras. Compared to the Olympus one, I am very dissapointed at the quality of the Sony pictures, especially after reading all the positive reviews. When taking pictures of a moving object in automatic mode, the pictures turn out very blurry. It did not happen with my Olympus one. I checked in the manual and found out that you can adjust the shutter speed but only in manual mode. However, i am not sophisticated enough to also program the focus, the light, etc. in the manual mode. I just want to have faster shutter speed in automatic mode, but I can't seem to know how.One plus though, this Sony camera takes pictures much faster than my old one. But given the choice of having quality pictures vs. having a lot of picture with low quality, I would go for the high quality one. I just spent a week vacation abroad and the picture quality was so bad that I end up deleting a lot of them.

I paid $200 for it plus $62 dollars for a SanDisk 512MB Memory Stick Pro. I definitely recommend getting that memory stick. It allows you to take 249 fine quality pictures at 4MP (image size 2304 x 1728) and 2994 in VGA mode, which is an image size of 640 x 480. The 16MB memory stick it comes with takes only 8 pictures if used at 4MP and 97 in VGA. The pictures are still very clear and crisp in VGA.I've been using the camera for days and I still haven't had to recharge the batteries it came with, which were half empty by the way. It's very small and light. Plus it looks great. The only thing is that it's a bit bulky so you can't fit it in your pocket. It's very easy to use. I still haven't read the manual and this is the first digital camera I own.It comes with software but you don't really need it. You can use MS Paint, Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop to resize, rotate or whatever it is you want to do and it still retains the picture quality. I don't know if this happens to everyone but when you plug in the USB, it says that it's a hi-speed USB device plugged into a non hi-speed USB hub. It also says that it might not function at reduced speed and that you need a hi-speed USB host but that's not true. It functions just fine. Another thing is that if you take off the flash, the picture will look kind of yellow if the area is not well lit. That's the only complaint I have. Go ahead and buy it while the price is still low.

It comes with computer software that takes you step by step through the operations.  You don't have to use trial and error to figure out what all those funny little symbols mean, everything is explained.  Like the other reviewers stated, you will need to purchase an additional memory card.  I got the 256 mb generic card from Wal-mart and it works great.  Don't buy for video purposes alone though, you can't zoom while shooting a video, you must set the zoom before you start and it remains there throughout the session.

There are 3 movie modes.  With a 256 MB memory stick (about $100), you get about 3 minutes of video on the best setting.  On the medium setting, you get 10 minutes of video.  The third setting does give you 2 hours of video, but is completely unusable.  The audio is very poor and the image is blurry and pixelated.  We're disappointed that Sony didn't offer a movie mode in between the terrible 160 mode and the Standard 640 mode.

This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands.

It's got a decently sized sensor (4.1MP), 3X optical zoom is not a big WOW, but most film point-and-shoots come with no zoom at all.LCD viewfinder is decently sized, though more expensive ones are, of course, bigger. The video mode is great and it's a good thing to have that AV cable for a quick share.If you are an average to sub-average picture-taker, like me, you will most probably not have a tripod around, so that alone will guarantee you blurry shots at sub optimal lighting conditions, unless you use the flash. So most of the enhanced scene modes, including nightime modes and also the manual control mode will most probably get blurry results. The good thing is that the camera will tell you when your shot would be prone to \"shake\" blur. That way you can decide to either not take the shot, adjust lighting conditions or get (if you have one) a tripod.It's a sturdy camera. It's over a year old and has survived at least one major fall, with some bumps here and there.The only thing I've noticed is that lately the pictures are turning up with a slight greenish feel on them. I'm pretty avid on photoshop and know how to correct the pics to get them lifelike colors, and the difference isn't bad.

The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!

Yet it is very easy to take photos and movies with this camera, just point-and-shoot.And it is cheap enough, when bought used (about $25) to give to a child as a \"starter camera\" or an older relative who's afraid to spend a lot of money on a new digital camera.The main reason I was able to continue using this camera was because Sandisk and Sony were smart enough to create an adaptor to update the old Sony memory stick when \"Sandisk\" became the industry standard memory stick for most digital cameras.The old memory stick problems were solved when an \"adaptor stick\" was created to fit the old Sony memory stick format with its new smaller sized larger capacity memory stick.I am now able have more memory space (4GB) in 2012 after replacing the old (2005) 128 MB Sony Memory Stick with the Sandisk Memory Stick Duo Adapter that can hold the newer Sony 4 GB Memory Stick ProDuo MSMT4G/TQ1 (Black).I bought the Sony Cybershot around 2005 to replace my old 35mm \"film\" camera. As a professional photographer, my old camera was becoming too expensive to use, paying for film and processing, and too much work to scan each photograph so I could upload each to the digital web world.I did have some doubts prior to going digital, that the quality of a \"digital\" photograph might not be as good as a traditional 35mm film image.This proved not to be true.After I started using the Sony Cybershot DSCP73 4.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, I was very impressed at how easy to use it was with auto-focus and how sharp and detailed the \"jpeg\" photographs were (see my samples uploaded to this page).Scanned 35mm photos are not as sharp and have dust spots. No dust spots with digital, saves retouching time.For the photography work I was doing (website photographs and PDF publications) this camera worked great because it was quick and sharp. I could even get good quality photographic prints - up to 11x14.The only downside with a digital point-and-shoot camera was the limits of my Sony Cybershot lens.No long lens for a sharp portrait/unsharp background effect that I missed with my old film format cameras.I am still able to push this camera to it's limits with macro photography (it has a special button on the camera) for super close detailed images which are impressive even at 4.1 mega pixels. I can still get very sharp, detailed close up images - good quality for website images and PDF publications.Outdoor scenes photograph best in daytime sunlight.Indoor flash is good for most normal types of subjects and people shots. Large groups of people indoors with a flash are good to OK, but a large auditorium may not get enough flash to light the whole room. Too close on a face with the flash can cause the subject to washout.However, It should be noted that you do have some control over the built in flash.The flash can be turned off or you can turn it on for a \"fill flash\" if you have the sun back lighting your subject.In dim light it has a \"red focusing light\" so you can temporarily shed enough light on your subject to see and focus - such as for a candle light shot (birthday cake).I still love that this camera is much smaller and lighter than my old 35mm camera.In 2005, the Sony Cybershot was considered small for a digital \"point and shoot\" camera, but in 2012 it is a little bit larger and bulkier than the newer models of digital cameras that are now very slim and small and can fit in a shirt pocket, but the Sony Cybershot still is small enough to fit in a purse or the glove compartment of your car.About the only thing that is out-of-date with this camera is its movie size format and the viewing screen is smaller.You can still shoot movie MPEGs (non-Letter Box) and upload them to Youtube with no problems.And this format still works with the old Windows Movie Maker and the newer 2012 Windows Live Movie Maker.The only problem is, it's not in \"High Definition\" (HD).You can increase the movie quality/length a little bit with a higher memory stick size.Also, you will need to keep your camera steady while filming because it does not have a \"Digital Image Stabilizer\".That being said, I am still able to create quality video productions for Youtube using this camera.Also, Energizer Rechargeable Batteries, AA Size, 8-Count work best with this camera.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good entry level camera", "Author": "Kilch123", "ReviewID": "R2QFKZ8E8AQBSC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought a used one of these, as I've been using one at work for years.

One thing I'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews, is that after a year or so, the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely.  For me, this hasn't happened with this camera.  It's always been great, and it has a lot of really convenient features.When I bought this camera, I knew NOTHING about cameras.  I just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was PRETTY.  I got really lucky--I mean, I only bought it because it was pretty--I knew nothing about it.  But, nonetheless, I got lucky and bought this camera that takes AA batteries, came with a battery charger and its own USB cord.  It had a ton of settings on it.  Now that I understand more about photography, I really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class.Like I said, i never had any problems with it.  Batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge.  I never even bought a memory card for this camera--I use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold, and my pictures are still decent quality.I'm now looking into a new camera because I do want excellent image quality, and, ironically, ever since I've been shopping for a new digital camera, my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird.Anyway, if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera, based on my experience with this one, I'd recommend the brand.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not bad, not good", "Author": "Stan \"QA Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R14YPHHEWEKPZB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned several digital cameras, and this is my current digital camera in hands. I would write a short review as a critical person with concentration ONLY on important things to watch for.Pros- Uses only 2 AA batteries.- Battery life is very good.- Small camera size. Easily fits into a pocket.- Can set '+' flash level, which forces camera to make a stronger flash. I use it almost every time.Cons- Resolution. The images are not sharp in terms of that you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture. I would say, there is no much difference in quality between 4 MP and 50% (1 MP) scaled down version. The same problem exists in Sony DSC W1 camera.- I had many problems with \"ON\" button. Sometimes camera refuses to turn on. It can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again. (It could be a defect in my camera only).- Some camera parts are painted plastic, which can be scratched.- Camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries (~several hours) or without them at all (10 minutes).- Video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode, but eats flash space very quickly. Windows 2000 didn't have the right codec to view the file.

Cuevas", "ReviewID": "R1ACODOKB2RGHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually originally went to this page through Google to see if they were still selling this model.  I have to say that this is a really good camera for casual photography, and is even still a good camera for being a 4.1 megapixel camera (considering you can purchase 6, 7, and even 8 megapixel cameras now).I bought this camera for myself in January 2005, and it's reaching its two-year mark, and still works close to perfectly.  It'd actually still be working perfectly if I didn't accidentally drop it so many times on hard surfaces (more than three hard falls!).  In my opinion, it takes great quality pictures, slightly above-average video if there is good lighting, and takes great pictures even without flash.  It's definitely a better camera than my dad's Fujifilm 7 megapixel camera, too.  I think my camera still has another year or two on it, if I could be less clumsy.  I've also gotten a lot of comments of photos I've taken.  People have said that I have a really good camera, and that it takes excellent pictures.I used to take a lot of pictures of bands, and they've always been pleased with them.  It does surprisingly well in dim environments.  Lately, I've been taking a lot of still life pictures for fun, and got a lot of good feedback on the quality of this camera.There is only one problem I have with this camera, however, and it's that it eats up batteries really fast.  I'm not exactly sure of what is considered good battery life for a digital camera, but I have to charge my batteries every day.Overall, this has been a really good camera to me through concerts, parties, film shoots, landscapes, still lifes, and amateur \"artsy\" photos.

It's extremely user-friendly, unlike HPs I've used, and action shots have never been a problem.  Just note that you can't zoom in while shooting movies (MPEG) but it does pick up sound cleanly.  I also found it to be very durable... it's been dropped countless times, used outside during the (Wisconsin) winter, and exposed to both water and sand but the picture quality hasn't decreased.

On the first vacation I went on with this camera, my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures, as did my Olympus, on the second vacation I returned from today as I write this, I just downloaded my pictures, and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad, the ones that came off my film camera are perfect!

Believe me, if I hadn't gotten it free as a present I'd be writing a nasty letter to Sony, as it is though my next camera I'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment, therefore knows what they're doing. Sony makes great TV's and home entertainment systems, anything else I've bought from them, or known someone who has, has been junk, their camera, their car stereos, their computers!
