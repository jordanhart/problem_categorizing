{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Baluns", "Author": "------------------", "ReviewID": "RWMUN8YL71Q7R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't used these baluns yet [7/23/2023]. However, after unboxing the baluns from their shipment packaging, They appear to me be manufactured of very good quality. The baluns appear to me to be more than adequate and excellent to use. I Would recommend the baluns to others because they appear to be great quality baluns.  My review is a neutral review. That is why I chose to enter a \"3\" star on the baluns. The \"3\" star is similar to college research, demonstrating the meaning of unbias towards not only the baluns, also the seller and manufacture, especially since I haven't used the baluns as of yet. In my belief, it would be unfair and unbeneficial to not only the seller, the manufacturer, it would also be the same inconsideration for consumers as well if I were to rate the baluns at more than a \"3\" star.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005FUWJJA"}}
