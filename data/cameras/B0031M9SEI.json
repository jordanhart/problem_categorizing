{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent infrared CCTV camera", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "RZOMDFM87L1VS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When my CCTV security system was struck by lightning, my previous Q-See camera (Q-See QS2350C) at the gates was fried. According to Q-See, that model is now discontinued although some are still available. So I purchased this one because it appeared to be a very similar model. The design and construction are quite good. The image is decent both in color and in infrared B&W.; I especially like the heater and fan. I believe it will be a rugged camera that should last quite a while (if we don't get hit by lightning again.)My problem with the camera was the field of view. It comes with an 8mm lens. I cannot move the mounting location and the view angle for an 8mm lens is about 42 degrees. So I could see only a small part of the driveway at the gates. I went to the Q-See site and found that they used to sell wide angle lens. However, they have stopped doing so. I emailed their customer service and asked where I could find a wide angle lens. That was weeks ago and I have never received an answer. So I started searching the web and found that what I needed was a 2.8mm Mini Board Lens. I'm sure Amazon won't let me tell you the company but I found it on a site that ends in Bay. For less than $15 with free shipping, I was able to replace the lens and I now get a 110 degree view angle. The difference is amazing. I did have to focus the lens by screwing it into and out of the board but that was pretty easy with an assistant to watch the monitor.If you purchase this camera, keep the view angle in mind. If you are mounting the camera less than 50-75 feet from the area that you wish to see, I believe you will be very disappointed.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best cams I have purchased", "Author": "S. langille \"sclanman\"", "ReviewID": "R1527TNMAR26B1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have three of these and for a 420 line camera you can't beat the crisp image it has. The lens is narrow so keep that in mind but what it lacks in aspect it more than makes up for in image and weather resistance.I have two of the older ones with the 110V power plug which seem to be all around better than the newer on with the 12V power supply but still a great camera.This thing has great! Night vision in the wide open spaces. Just make sure there is nothing close to reflect to ir light which will wash out your image at night.Also, it's a great bug light, lolUpdate March 2014All three of these are still going strong while a few other brands have died. I had a seal go on one that was facing directly into the sun and very exposed which made the image foggy at night but I just replaced it with a generic o-ring and its good to go again. The night vision has always been good with this model because they use the large ir led's which seem much better than a crap load of the smaller ones.Will be oredering 4 of the newer model to see if they are as good as these, they claim 700 lines of resolution but I hope they dont just throw a cheap board and sensor in it to get the specs up, marketing monkeys ;)", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent picture and great distance but huge camera", "Author": "vipergts_r_92", "ReviewID": "R2BILULRW765SX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera works excellent with cold climates and has great clarity in the picture resolution and has great night vison clarity as well only down side to this camera is its size it is very large and heavy", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good at night, lens is too narrow", "Author": "Doctor C", "ReviewID": "R1V1LWBE2F66K7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were never that happy with the old Q-See QS2350C because at night it was very foggy and even though our parking lot is lit decently, it was very bad qualiy.  Because of that when it died, we were hoping the newer version would have a more light sensitive sensor and give better quality since in 3 years camera technology has improved greatly.  We were wrong.First, this camera requires an external power adapter while the old one was powered by line AC.At night, this camera shows all white with no contrast in the picture.  In day time the picture is clear and better than our other cameras, but even then as the other reviewer mentioned, the field of view is very narrow.  i dont know why they have such a long focal length on a surveillance camera and why it's different than the old version.I was quite upset with Qsee and put in a harsh review but decided to tone it down a bit because the day time picture IS very clear, but I don't know why night vision is so difficult outside.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kind of a crappy camera", "Author": "John Kemp", "ReviewID": "R3PY2NWQFWKIZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera lasted about 30 days the little red lights that do the night vision stopped workingQ-See seems like a very small business (home business)Emails went ignored no customer support through the web site.Junk will not buy again.Shipping was good but product was defective and has no support", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0031M9SEI"}}
