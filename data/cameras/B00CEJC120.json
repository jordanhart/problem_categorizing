{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great bundle!", "Author": "Willy Nilly \"-Willy Nilly\"", "ReviewID": "R2MI1PMG1U3Q4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought this I tallied up the MSRP's on all this stuff and the body + lenses came out to well over $1300. Sure, Canon's MSRP's are a little ambitious but this package is solid with great stuff. The camera itself is of course very nice, the lenses are well suited and everything seemed to be perfectly brand new. All the Canon gear came with matching serial numbers and warranty registrations. The bag is a little too small but whatever. The filters and extra battery are nice but really for the price the camera and lenses are worth it. I would recommend this but I almost wish I had gotten the 70D with the dual processors. However, the 60D's flip out screen is nice so you don't get your nasty face oil all over the LCD screen.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Yay!", "Author": "Hayley", "ReviewID": "R1JEUCE427Z60R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was amazing and I'm so excited with my purchase.

Everything was as advertised on the website. The first pictures I took blew my mind because the quality was just outstanding.

Bray", "ReviewID": "R2UURL0OQTPG9Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything came and seems to be working great so far. The only thing is the carrying case sent is not the same carrying case as pictured. Kind of disappointed because the bag I got is not as good as the one shown. Other than the wrong bag, all of the accessories and camera are just what I wanted. I recommend to anyone wanting to get a camera bundle.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase!", "Author": "Nikki Allen", "ReviewID": "RFW722A1KI5UG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the camera, and it came with 3 really great lenses for a beginner.  Three things you should know:  the case is large and can hold everything you see pictured (minus the tripod), the tripod feels a little flimsy, and the flash is not one that you connect to the top of the camera.  None of the negative things would have prevented me from buying the kit had I known these ahead of time.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Flash not what is shown, in fact it is called a flash \"adapter\"", "Author": "jim", "ReviewID": "R2CY8HTBF83L0Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The flash shown is not the one shipped so to me that is a big negative when you don't get what is shown and listed, in fact I don't even think it is a flash, it say \"adapter\" and looks like it is for attaching a flash to.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Hongqiao Zhang", "ReviewID": "R1LIXRZITX17SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awesome  thats a good camera . i like it so much . but if i have more lens ,thats better", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CEJC120"}}
