Has 2GB internal memory only (2 Hours of Video and sound). NOTE: sound may not record when camera is inside waterproof housing. Charging is by USB port only (May take 2 hours to charge). A large number of adapters are provided for mounting. I purchased mine for $70.00 at a local Hobby Shop, seems like a reasonable value at this price, most sites suggest $139. Works great on my first test video. Will be nice on the back of my RC Vela 1 meter sail boat.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "High definition video with sound, 720p at 30fps\nWaterproof housing, up to 100' / 30 m\nEasily clips on goggles and mounts on any surfaces with included mounting clips and accessories for hands free video\nPerfect for diving, skiing, kayaking, swimming, cycling, RC hobbies, and other sporting activities\n4GB Micro SD card included Micro SD card slot supports up to 32 GB Built-in Lithium-polymer rechargeable battery", "Name": "Concord HDWO-001 Easy Shot Clip HD (720p) Digital Video Camera with Outdoor/Diving Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DO78cW4NL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007FHUH1I"}}
