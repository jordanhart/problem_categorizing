{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent camera for a throw-in-your-purse/duffle-bag-and-go type camera", "Author": "G. M. Gerloff", "ReviewID": "R3E3OFMX0179SO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera that you don't really need to worry about. Just keep a couple batteries on trips because the camera just dies when it feels like it, without much warning. It takes GREAT pictures under the right environment (Natural lighting outside, or well lit rooms inside). It does not do well for shots of the cafeteria stage from the back or the hall. I am happy with it, because if I go on a camping trip I can literally just throw this camera in one of the bags and I know I'll get some good pictures.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.0-megapixel CCD\n4x optical/5x digital/20x total zoom\n2.7\" LCD monitor\nFace detection and tracking technology\nMovie mode", "Name": "Insignia 120-Megapixel Digital Camera - Metallic Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jXd0JUsaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004D5MLVY"}}
