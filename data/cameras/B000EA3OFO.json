{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good little camera", "Author": "R. Ritzman \"sfseals\"", "ReviewID": "R1S2MQN2XNFNXN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In bright daylight the FE-130 takes bright crisp pictures with vivid colors.  At night, the flash provides plenty of light at medium to close range.  The \"night mode\" (which keepts the shutter open for several seconds while snapping a quick flash) is a neat feature that I've enjoyed using as well.While not the smallest of the subcompacts, it is surprisingly small and light, and comfortably fits in a jacket or even shirt pocket.There is no memory included, so you'll need to buy an XD card, preferably 512 mb or more.The camera runs on 2 AA's which is convenient, and I've been getting around 50 or 60 shots in (with heavy use of the flash) between replacements, which is not bad for a couple of measly AA's.The included Olympus Master software is intuitive and easy to use.The display is smallish (2 inch), which is a bit of a nuisance if you are used to a larger one but is clear and bright.Overall, I'm happy with this camera.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for new and experienced users!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R6K1T7JUPA6FD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my first digital camera a couple years ago, and as I learned more about digital cameras I started to search for a new one. Then I stumbled on the Olympus FE-130. I just bought it recently, and it lived up to all my expectations! It has many unique shooting modes so you can achieve the right setting, has an excellent display screen, and takes quality pictures (5.1 MP is great!) The only problem is that it doesn't have a view finder, and it doesn't have a black and white color setting mode (at least, I haven't found it yet!) Overall, this camera is worth the money and I highly recommend it to any photography lover.", "Date": "September 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "AWESOME LITTLE CAMERA", "Author": "L.

The video functionality is crisp and clear as well the pictures.  I bought this one for work and may buy another for me at home.

Then the flimsey plastic latch to the battery compartment broke.  This is an amazingly cheap flaw for a (supposedly) good brand.  Anyway, we mailed it in to be fixed to an Olympus repair center in NY and are still waiting to get it back (3 weeks later).  At this point I'm not sure I care if I get it back or not.  I'm already looking at other cameras.  Update:  I got a letter from Olympus informing me that the problem is not under warranty and it will cost $100.70 to fix what is probably a $0.10 plastic latch. No thank you.  Guess whose products I am never going to buy again?  I am also going to plaster this review on any consumer website I can find.  Smart move Olympus!", "Date": "February 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "pocket size with big quality", "Author": "S. Wallace \"Avonlea Watcher\"", "ReviewID": "RJ3WHZGBJL2ZG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm happy with my little handy camera. It takes nice pictures and is easy to use. It's also easy to transfer the images to a computer or printer. I gave it 3 stars for the following, it's slow to capture an image, there's like a 1 second delay which makes taking pictures of children and animals pretty tedious if they are moving around.Also you can capture movies but they don't have sound.Other wise a great pocket size camera!", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "A. Sanders", "ReviewID": "RBM5016RU2HGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera a few weeks ago, and it's absolutely great. There wasn't anything broken. The latch that covers the batteries and SD card has a little lock to hold it in place. The pros outweight the cons. The only thing bad about this camera, is that if you are in a room that does not have a lot of light the pictures may be a little dim, depending on the settings you have on the camera. Other than that, there are a lot of features. It does have the black and white,sepia, frames, and pre-text features to use after you snap a photo. It doesn't use the battery power quick like most battery operated cameras have. As far as getting the pictures developed, I'm not sure if there are any pixelations that show, but using them for email, website, etc., the pictures are clear and Crisp.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Ginny", "ReviewID": "RO689K9AXWOPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this camera for a few weeks, but so far I love it.

One problem though, when I got a memory card, I saw the writing that says 'push to eject' & what looked like a button. Well I pressed it really hard & broke something off & got the 'card cover open' message. I then realized that you are supposed to push the memory card itself, not this other thing.I took to a camera shop I found online. The guy told me it would be expensive to really fix it but that he could 'rig it up' & be just as good. I was shocked when he did it for nothing.Anyways, I am happy with this camera just wish I had read the manual about the memory card as I have never used one before. I have the FE-140 but it i almost identical to this & mine is 6 megapixels, not 5.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "olympus", "Author": "Evripidou Maria", "ReviewID": "R3OIJL1DNH8GXL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "nice camera it does its job, btut I am dissapointed because it doenst ahve sound in its videos, unlike what I saw online.

Thompson", "ReviewID": "RPH5ITY6GHDKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I agree with several of the people who have written in here. I have used the camera for a grand total of maybe 2 weeks and it is hitting me with the \"Card cover open\" message mentioned in other reviews and it will not do anything else. The small button one needs to push to eject the memory card broke the first time I ejected the card, and as you have read from other reviews here, they will fix it, but for about $100. On to a better camera. Olympus has lost my business as well! AVOID THIS CAMERA.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!", "Author": "S.

I contacted Olympus to order just the cover so I can repair it, and the repair dept. has the parts but they wont sell the parts to consumers.  But for about $100, I can send them the camera and they can repair it for me.  It costs a little over $100 for the camera I and refuse to pay the same for the repair of the lock.

It is great for anyone who wants a great little camera for taking fun pictures with friends or family. I would recommend this to people my age (13)and even to adults.There are just a fefw drawbacks, including an extended shutter delay when you are using specific modes, and the battery doesn't last very long before you have to replace them.Overall though, the good quaities (including the fact that it can hold up to about 270 pictures withot even buying an additional memory card)override the bad ones!", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed with the Olmpus brand", "Author": "Paul A.
