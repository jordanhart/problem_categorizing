Choose a package with the Cannon 55-250mm IS lens instead.The case is cheap, and it has no zip to completely seal it. I am worried to bring it to the beach with a lot of wind and sand.Haven't tried the external flash yet, but after reading the manual, it seems to be better to buy a Canon external flash to make the best use of the camera.The other items are fine.With the recent Amazon sale of buying a camera and one extra lens together, you can get t3i with the 55-250mm IS lens and other accessory stuff (without the external flash) with a similar price.It is not the seller to blame, but do your homework before placing the order", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Trevor A. Bingham", "ReviewID": "R9SYO7XXI6IB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with the intention to learn all the capabilities.  While I still haven't learn all of them, I have found that with the automatic settings, it is about as easy as a point-and-shoot but with significantly better quality pictures and I can still do all the manual adjustments when I learn more.  The HD video capability is also a big plus.  The particular kit came with everything I wanted and was a much better deal than other kits.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "great deal! great price!", "Author": "elleenor", "ReviewID": "R2RWAIDUQID27M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are not professional photographers but we are so happy with it.
