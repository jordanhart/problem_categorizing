{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Everyday Use Camera - PERIOD", "Author": "L. Starkand \"Dilletante\"", "ReviewID": "RHPI9BHZ7A24L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking to buy a Digital Camera for the last several years. The problem always seemed to be that the Cameras I could afford/justify were usually too weak in what they offered. Poor picture quality, difficult to use, etc.Well, finally finances and timing came together and I went shopping. I tried all of the 4+ MP cameras. While many were wonderful, they all came with many features that I knew I would never use. Not for lack of interest, but more that I KNOW I am an amature and the most important thing to me was to take GOOD pictures that I can share with friends and family.Then came the Kodak DX7630. Incredibly easy to use, acessible buttons, menus and features, a huge LCD screen in the back and a whopping 6.1 Megapixels.I have had this camera a few days and like most guys with a new toy really gave it a workout. I took pics in all kinds of environments, all kinds of light conditions and I am AMAZED by the quality. Using the night portrait mode I took pictures of my Mother-in-law's outdoor garden with no ambient light beyond the moon. The pictures came out stunning, so much so that a friend of mine is using it as a background on his computer.Other shots I took indoor and out were just as crisp, just as easy. One of my biggest problems is that I have what is called familial shaking, I simply can't keep a camera perfectly still. I can't tell you how many shots were ruined with my regular camera because of that. The Kodak seems to compensate just fine. More importantly, I get to see the pic immediately and if I have a problem, I delete it and shoot again.The Easyshare does for Digital what the Instamatic did for film cameras. Puts a powerful, easy to use camera so simple that anybody can take good pictures from day 1. Now with 6.1 MP, the EasyShare is a bigger bargain than ever.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Worth the price!", "Author": "Allan Bach", "ReviewID": "R7LJ4P2M4TOS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "** Update - I just received my first 20x30 picture from Ophoto - It is very impressive. I took the picture hand held at 1/30 second, wide open aperture. Only slight abberation on the edges and, even at 1/30, the picture was sharp and colors true. I'm now trying pictures with a tripod to minimize any movement.****I just received this Kodak camera and took some day and night pictures. I have no problem with the resolution - the prints are more than sharp. In cloudy situations where shade is caused by green trees, I get a magenta color in shadows. This does not always happen, snd I am still trying out different situations. The auto-focus is great, time between pictures is very quick (< 1.5 seconds) and the camera is light with most controls placed well. However, the dial for choosing the mode (Auto, Aperture or Shutter priority, etc.) gets a little difficult to turn at times. It could be improved.The included instruction book is OK, but I found it lacking in some of the features for the camera. For instance, to change the aperture or shutter in aperture or shutter priorty mode, you need to press the wheel in, then turn to adjust the aperture or shutter. I did not see that in the manual (if it's there, it isn't apparent).If you're looking for a more than adequate digital camera that can supply sharp enlargements ( up to 16x20 or greater ) then this is the one to buy. The lens is excellent. I especially like the ability to set the camera manually. Night time pictures were excellent. A great way to explore the world of digital photography.", "Date": "May 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best in Class!", "Author": "Dave Shaun \"Digital_Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZRSPVMHXU40K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the Kodak cx7530 previously and found the dx7630 to a step up in class, performance, and features.  The 7630 is an excellent, above average, point and shoot camera but the additional SLR-like features really makes this camera an excellent choice and outstanding value!  I have taken better pictures with the 7630 than I have with my SLR!I highly recommend the dx7630 to novice and intermediate photographers.  Even expect SLR user will find the Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens, the full manual control over shutter, aperture and ISO speed to render outstanding sharp images.Check out the \"bowl of apples\" images (and others) I took with this camera.Pros:1. ultra sharp Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens2. full manual control over shutter, aperature, and ISO3. flash intensity compensation (you control the amount of light on the foreground subject!)4. continuous focus mode \"tracks\" your subject without having to lock the focus5. massive and clear 2.2\" LCD6. the rechargeable LiON battery lasts a long time (120 shots where 60 used the flash)7. ISO 800 feature allows natural photos in ambient indoor light.8. 2 JPEG compressions modes which helps if you travel a lot9. 3 modes of metering exposure10. 16 scene modes11. placement of all controls allows single hand manipulation.12. ability to disable digital zoom, choose sharpness, and choose saturation.13. fast turn-on, fast shutter to shot, and fast shot to shot.14. images get auto-rotated when taking a portrait15. LCD goes blank after a while of no-use to conserve power16. very quiet focus and zoom.17. multi-point focus always renders sharp foreground images; i found few images out of focus18. shadows and dark areas are not grainy or noisy; this is helpful when you're cropping pics and enlarging them19. very smooth transitions in bright area and never washed out; this helps you with contrast especially if you convert to black and white laterCons:1. no dedicated self-timer button (only two steps to get to it, though)2. can not use AA but the rechargeable battery lasted a long time and is smaller than a pair of AA's.3. no PictureBridge support but I always manipulate my images before printing a hardcopy so it wasn't an issue4. no self closing cover but i tossed the lens cap and the lens is recessed enough so it doesn't scratch in my camera bag.5. smallest aperature is f8 but then again, this isn't a true SLR", "Date": "October 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Very good 6MP camera", "Author": "Srinivasa Cheemalapati \"SKumar\"", "ReviewID": "R3J9A0JXAK7H2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using my 1 Mega pixel Fiji camera for more than 2 years I was shopping for an upgrade. I was looking for an offordable 3 MP camera when I came across Kodak DX7630 6MP camera for lesser price.After reading a lot about digital cameras manufactures by the markets gaints like Canon,Nikon and Olympus, I thought do I have to really buy a kodak. Well I took a chance becuase I got the camera at a very good deal ($250 at Officemax). This deal only lasted for 2 hours (lucky me).After using the camera for a month, I am very happy with the performance. Kodak integrated all the features as a software into this camera. Like different modes (Ladscape,night...) are provided by a touch of a button and the screen is displayed with all the modes.The Quality at 6MP is very very good. The flash works really good unlike my previous camera where I can hardly see something in the picture at night. It comes with a a special battery with lasts very long (approx 90+ pics).The size of the picture is about 2.3 Megabits, so a 256MB card and give you about 99 pics (at 6 MP,High res). Turn on the camera and shoot the first picture in 4.5 secs. Not bad when you don't want to miss any moment.The camera has a bigger LCD to view the images, and the Menus are very pleasent. It also comes with cable to download the pictures and 32MB internal memory when you run out of space in your SD card.Finally, very good 6MP camera for the price.Cons:1. Cannot use regular batterries. Need to buy the special battery that is compatable.2. The model is bulk and little heavy (but all kodak models are like that).3. No automatic lens cap. You have to put a manual cap like most film SLR cameras.", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera for the money", "Author": "Susumu Inoue \"Sam, the Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R33JM7ZJ645C4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to use Canon Powershot S30. I liked it except that the autofocus has never been razor-sharp. This Kodak DX7630 solved this problem. Though in the beginning, various options indicated on a dial were a little bit confusing, once I became accustomed to it, the selection of any option became almost instinctive. The color it produces is brilliant, and one can take good pictures under almost any circumstances. I have not printed any pictures larger than 8X10, and therefore I can't tell the limit of resolution, but certainly it is good enough for 8X10 enlargement. The only disappointment is that one can not select ISO, shutter speed, or f-stop even in the manual, S-, or A-(aperture priority mode)mode. I don't think I missed these options in the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet, by the way, is not too detaild either. I bought optional macro lenses and an adaptor for the lenses. These lenses take extremely good pictures of a flower pedal, a bud etc. Overall, this is not a camera for professionals, but for everyday photography for recording your lives, it is one fine camera.", "Date": "October 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Also a battery latch issue!!

The pictures are AMAZING, both in color and clarity, the detail is sharp, crisp and true, and, with the huge screen, picture taking is a breeze.  I've tried several of the various photo styles (night pictures, snow, active children, etc), and each time the pictures were beautiful. I haven't picked up my old favorite Ricoh in months.

There's not much of a learning curve, the body feels solid in the hands and the image quality is a good match for on-screen use and consumer level printouts. Shutter lag seems minimal, the AF is fast, battery life is long and the large LCD display is easy on the eyes.On the downside, this camera would not be the best choice for more deliberate, tripod bound photography. Aside from the rudimentary self-timer, the DX7630 lacks any remote shutter release option and does not support any uncompressed file formats. Also, the JPEG compression is somewhat excessive and the camera provides no user controlled noise reduction.These limitations shouldn't trouble most Kodak shoppers as this camera really shines in other areas.", "Date": "July 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "another broken battery latch", "Author": "conradw", "ReviewID": "R23ONMESSAQQMY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had my DX7630 for less than a week before my battery latch broke.

I was dissapointed in the HP. The Kodak is so good at taking pictures & so easy to use that I am now selling my old 35mm Minolta SLR. The picture quality is so sharp it rivals 35mm sharpness. There are enough manual controls that you would find on a good SLR that any want to be photographer will love.One thing I've been reading is that people have been having problems with the battery case cover breaking off. You have to be very careful opening & closing the cover. However all digital cameras have very similar flimsy covers. I work in a Photo Lab and tell all my customers they have to be very very careful with any digital camera battery slot. This seems to be common negative on any digital camera. I have had this camera for a month now, have used it every day taken the battery out every night to recharge and have not had the cover break off yet. If you are careful it wont break. These are not cheap cameras, you just have to treat them with care. Also some have complained about the software, & I have not had any problems with it, it's been real easy to use & print out from.in conclusion this is a great camera that takes excellent photos.", "Date": "July 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wow!!!", "Author": "S.

As a result, it is subject to considerably more wear and tear. Compare this to, say, the Sony Cybershot 5.1Mp, which at least has a separate button to power on/off the camera. The Kodak design also means that your mode setting is \"forgotten\" each time you turn off the camera; you'd have to conscientously reselect it each time you turn the camera on.Interchangeable lenses for the 7630 (available separately at additional cost) include wide, telephoto & macro, all of which require a lens adapter; all parts must be screwed on to the body. Performance of these lenses are okay. Note that the Kodak doesn't remember zoom settings (unlike, say, the Olympus C-50 5.1Mp), so you'd have to take the time to zoom in for each telephoto shot lest you get part of the lens in your photo.Pictures taken with the DX7630 are very good, even better if you have a steady hand or tripod and opt out of digital zoom.  Optical zoom, on the other hand, goes up to 3x, versus 10x on the camera's DX7590 5Mp cousin. Color accuracy under artifical light conditions continue to be a challenge, even when using the camera's light compensation settings for fluorescent and incandescent lights. However, third-party photo editing software will help fix most of the color problems.Camera warm-up and shooting tends to be slow, taking up to 2 seconds per shot--better suited for careful, calculated shots. Burst photography mode (taking multiple pictures in quick succession) is available on the DX7630 at the click of the button, but the slow processing time means you'll be sitting idle for some 10 seconds after you take the burst sequence.In sum, I enjoy the DX7630's picture-taking capabilities, but scoff at its cumbersome accessorization and lack of durability.

At $350 it was more than I'd wanted spending for my first digital camera, but I needed it to take quality photos of my artwork.  It had a \"flower\" feature, which took nice closeups of my smaller, more detailed work.  The \"museum\" setting did a fine job of getting the colors right without the glare of a Flash.Two months after the 1-yr warranty ran out the shutter button fell off.  No harsh treatment, just cheap manufacturing.  I went online to see about getting it fixed and, as another reviewer noted, they estimated it would cost $135 to fix it.  The other option they offered me was to trade it in for a refurbished camera they deemed similar, and I could check the box next to the one I wanted.  The hitch was there was no guarantee they'd have the one I chose in stock, so they'd have to pick some other lemon if that was the case and send me that.This is infuriating!  Finances are difficult enough for artists, and when we make a big investment like this from a (formerly) trusted name like Kodak, we expect that investment to last forever, like my parents' and grandparents' Kodaks did.  No more Kodak for me.  $350 for slightly more than one year's use is a BAD, BAD INVESTMENT.  Can't tell you how disappointed and angry I am about this waste of money.Congratulations to those of you who purchased this camera and are still in the honeymoon phase with it.

Everything about this camera just spelled quality, like the reviews online, our friends who had other Kodak cameras, Kodak's long history; That is until the battery died. It comes with a lithium ion rechargeable battery. I guess it's important to have a rechargeable one because digital cameras require alot of energy.The lithium battery that I had with my camera lasted about 2 weeks plus. You could probably consider this a high mark.The problem with it is that the battery latch or lock breaks. In my experiance, it broke the second time on the first camera, and then the first time on the 2nd and 3rd cameras.Yes, you heard me. I returned this 3 times. Let me REPEAT,I've returned this camera 3 times to the retailer(Sears) and the latch has broken EVERYTIME!!!!! The people who bought this and didn't experiance this problem, I would love to see their camera. Maybe Sears only stock the lowest quality. I DON'T TRUST KODAK at the moment and I DON'T TRUST Sears. When I first decided to buy this camera, the reviews I read suggested the camera was easy to use and the picture quality was good. True on both cases. Unfortunately, it has a CHEAP PLASTIC quality to it. The actual casing is poor. This camera is not durable and breaks easily. Sears was good about accepting returns except the 3rd time. The clerk was RUDE! After a little screaming and yelling he took it back.

I tried slowing the shutter speed down and opening up the aperature but most of the pictures I took came out blurry, unless I used the tripod. Sometimes even then as in outdoor shots, most of the time the camera would not acheive focus lock.  It would give me the warning symbol tellimg me it couldn't lock focus and sure enough, the pictures would come out blurry.No manual focus.  This would help when the camera doesn't achive focus lock which in my experience was most of the time I was outside.I wish I had more to say and rate this camera on, but it broke after two or three uses and about 2 weeks time.Seriosly folks, my little casio Z4U does a much better job of achieving focus than this camera.  Not that it is perfect but I would expect the Kodak to do a better job than my little casio camera any day and in most any way.

I've found the picture quality is quite a good - a large improvement over my previous camera - a 3 MP Kodak DX3900. Don't believe it if a salesman tells you it's not about the megapixels. Megapixel count is the single most import thing in these low end digital cameras. A high megapixel count makes the picture come out looking much clearer and more natural. It also gives you flexibility to crop and blow up a picture without visible loss of quality due to pixelization. I only wish it were 12 MPs instead of 6. I also wish the ISO could be set above 400 - but this is typical of compact digital cameras.The camera's video mode is also pretty cool. With this camera, you can shoot video continuously until the camera's memory is full. With the 1GB SD chip I bought with the camera ($65), I'm able to shoot continuous video with sound for up to 80 min. So the camera doubles as my home movie camera. The video res is only 320x240 - which, again, is typical for digital cameras. I wish it were 640x480 though - that would bring it pretty much on par with a miniDV camera. Video quality is good though, and the sound comes out well. Unfortunately, the zoom is limited in video mode. You can adjust the zoom before shooting, but once video is rolling, the zoom is stuck.The camera has plenty of manual control. The controls are easy to use once you get the hang of them. The menus don't run deep, so almost any control can be set quickly, without having to do too much navigation.All in all, I highly recommend this camera.
