I've been a Canon user for years and I think the Canon Digic processor produces better pictures, but the Nikon is very good.- Fast start up time- Decent battery life, even with WiFi (plus some smart power features like wifi upload when you plug it in)- Nice, large LCD viewfinder- Good, intuitive UI- Smile mode works wellThings I don't like:- The shutterspeed seems slow, especially in red-eye mode.  I find a lot of pics in redeye mode have the people with eyes closed.  My Canons never did this.- All the scene modes are a bit bewildering... I think it will take some time to figure out which modes work best in which situations.- Proprietary connector for PC, looks like mini-USB, but isn't", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Fragile Screen on Coolpix S610", "Author": "B.

Despite the problems outlined below, I tried to use it for several weeks, taking it everwhere with me. I'm not a photo professional, but it appears to me that it does take nice pictures and produces reasonable quality video. Unfortunately, I ended up returning it for the following reasons:* When you are in a menu, pressing the shutter release does not return the camera to picture taking mode. Instead, you have to navigate out of the menus! This is a very serious problem. Also, you have to remember whether you are in the \"Mode\" menu or the \"Menu\" menu. You cannot exit the Mode menu by pressing the \"Menu\" button, nor can you exit the \"Menu\" menu by pressing the \"Mode\" button. I missed several good shots because of this fiddling.* The camera takes forever to get picture ready. It takes several seconds between pressing the power button to when you can take your first picture - but its also deceptive. When you turn it on, the LCD immediately begins to show what the camera sees, but you must wait for the rest of the display to load before you can take a shot/access menus/go into movie mode/whatever. I would turn it on and frantically try to take a picture to no avail. I missed several shots because of this. I would absolutely recommend against this camera if you are trying to take pictures of children. You WILL miss shots waiting for it to boot.* The software on the camera crashes. Several times, my camera rebooted itself. It would become unresponsive, the screen would go dark, and it would shut itself off. It would come back to life after I pressed the power button a few times.* There is no way battery status indicator! Keep you battery charged or cross your fingers.If the camera only suffered from one or two of these problems, I could live with it. I hate the hassle of returning electronics. But when you combine all of these problems in one camera, its a disaster.", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Skip this model, or Nikon all together", "Author": "Military Mommy", "ReviewID": "R3I1BQ2RQWQE41", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I give this a one star rating because I am extremely disappointed in this product. I bought his camera because in the past I have had a great Nikon point and shoot, but after 6 months of use with the s610, and reading other reviews, I see I am not alone in my problems. I had the Nikon 5900 camera, which was the best camera I have ever owned, of any brand. Of course that model is 5 years old (I have been through another Nikon and a Canon since), and so extinct, but I am disappointed in the apparent decline of Nikon quality. I have learned my lesson.1) The biggest problem is the camera's inability to take pictures in normal (tungsten) lighting. Even flipping the white balance to manual (and pre-setting it), the picture looks yellow. The only way I have been able to get somewhat normal looking pictures, inside at night, is to put the white balance to daylight. I have tried the other WB settings to no avail (they either come out yellow or bleached blue). Many of the comments I have seen on reviewers with this same problem have said operator error, well, I have manually adjusted this camera with all the settings and am convinced that this is a Nikon or s610 problem! This is a big problem for me, as I don't get to choose what time of day my kids do cute things. Daytime photos (with lots of natural light) are better. This could be a flash problem because the flash is also very weak on this camera, so that could be it.2) Taking pictures in lower light with flash is a hit or miss process. The flash ONLY lights up where the focus is, and is weak at best. Also, indoors I must have the flash on all the time. We have many windows in our house with plenty of natural light, and I should not have to force flash in the daytime to get crisp clear pictures on a 10MP camera. (without the flash the pictures are very grainy- disappointment in a 10MP camera)3) No matter what ISO setting I set the camera to, I am getting a lot of noise. This is also disappointing in a 10MP camera, and the noise problem is why I chucked my Cannon elf (5MP) for this camera. Grainy pictures should not be happening in the middle of the day, with flash. The VR stabilizer is a joke.(also one of the reasons for my purchasing this model)4) The \"face priority\" is also a joke. It either does not recognize the face, or if it does, it takes FOREVER to lock in and take the picture, by which time my subjects faces (5, 3 & 1 year old) are not even looking at the camera anymore, and we have to start all over again. If you don't have the face priority on, you must use the manual focus, or make sure that the auto flash is picking up what you want to focus on. Again, this hogs your time, and by the time you set all that, the picture is over. Exactly why I did NOT buy and SLR, because I do not want to have to manually set the camera for each shot.5) Even though the LCD screen is big and clear, it does not accurately reflect the picture taken. Sometimes the picture looks crisp on my LCD, and upon downloading it to my computer or printing it off, the picture is a tad fuzzy. This is a BIG disappointment in 10 MP camera! So, I end up paparazzi-ing my kids, just to make sure that one out of the 5 shots I take will actually be clear when printed.If I wanted to have to manually adjust my camera each time I take a shot (and miss the shot since my subjects are almost always small children) I would have purchased a SLR. This is not really a point and shoot, as it should be ready to go, and take good pictures in automatic mode with minimal adjustments. Not a good price for the quality, especially a 10MP!!", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "My Experience with Coolpix S610", "Author": "wally j zaleski", "ReviewID": "R1V3PVHHTTAEFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd digital camera.

If the dynamic range of the scene clips one or two of the color channels in the sensor, you will find yourself with a picture with colors in the highlights that don't exist in the real scene (a terrible artifact that shows poor technological design). Suppose you are taking an outdoors portrait, with clouds and everything. If the highlights clip (as it happened to me in 50% of the time) then I ended up with pink-colored clouds! Unacceptable.Face detection doesn't work all that well, and the menu design is deeply flawed. Suppose you are deep in the menus changing the config, and while you are on it, you view a scene that has to be shot FAST, or you loose the moment; In most digitals, pressing the shutter will take you out of the menu instantly and you'll be able to take the picture. The S610, on the other hand, will do nothing and you will have to navigate the menu to get out of it, thus loosing the picture opportunity and becoming very frustrated.My mother has a canon SD870IS. It is a much cheaper and lower tech P&S; than the S610, but  it does all of the things that the S610 does so poorly. I highlly recommend the SD870 over the S610.

It worked well for me when I went to Japan to take quick snap shots of where I visited (mostly outside). The start up for the camera is very fast, opening up immediately when you press the \"on\" button; this was something I especially needed and wanted, specifically, for my winter trip there, and also one of the main reasons why I bought this camera was for the fast start up speed. When I was visiting Japan, I was able to walk down a section of the street and easily pull out my camera to take a quick snap shot without having to stop. That function was wonderful to have when I was in a rush.The battery life was amazing, which was also something I was looking into. I needed my camera to last throughout the whole day when I was visiting Japan and it ended up lasting longer than a day. If I remembered correctly though, I may have asked for the extended battery life when I bought the camera, so they may have upgraded that for me. I was able to use this camera for a whole week and only needed to charge it twice. To me, that's a super win win situation, because my old camera had a horrible battery life, which only lasted a couple hours.The quality of this camera was nice for the most part, but at times it would be blurry. It definitely showed clarity for most of my pictures, but there would be occasions when some of the pictures don't focus all too well. You would have to hold the camera extremely still sometimes in order to capture a certain moment... I find myself taking more than one picture of same item sometimes in order to get it \"just\" right. If you're a perfectionist in terms of clarity, this would be the best suited camera to select. I would still enjoy the camera (if I hadn't broken it), since it's 10 mega-pixels definitely showed me a lot of detail in my pictures, but you'd have to be a bit patient.The functionality of the camera was easy to use and set up, give or take a few moments where I needed to look up something in the manual, in order to find more details of what the button/function did.The optical zoom of the camera was nice to have, but it wasn't great. I was expecting to have more focus in the zoom, considering this was a 4x the optical zoom preference. The lens in this camera, or any camera with high zoom, protrudes outwards when it's on, so you have to be careful not to drop it while it's on, or it could be jammed. Since the \"on\" and \"off\" button on this camera is easily accessible, it was also easy for things to push into it and turn on, thus, turning on the camera and pushing out the lens outward. Because of this, my camera lens broke, and/or was jammed, when my friend left this camera on the leather couch and someone pushed it aside, turning it on because it hit something, and another person sat on it (cause they didn't see it), which essentially crushed the camera lens... it was an unfortunate event, considering how I had bought this item at full price when it first came out.I like the camera, but it could be better. I would still like to own another one if I had the money to buy a new, mainly, for the way it looks. I know that sounds kinda shallow, but it looks pretty sleek, and it's the perfect size for me (not too small, and not too big).Overall, it's good, but not great. It has a fast and speedy start up function. The picture quality is good, but the focus can be a little off making it a bit blurred. The lens and LCD screen for any particular camera is very fragile, and this camera is NOT an exception. Happy purchasing, everyone.

The photo quality was uncharacteristically terrible. The white balance was way off even though the flash was on. The picture looked as if they were taken with the highest ISO on the camera. I manually set the ISO on 80 (or 100 I am not sure) and set the white balance on Flash and the photos became a little bit better but you could still see that the colors are way off. Did I mention that it also looked as if you are taking pictures with the 2MP camera on your cellphone? There were absolutely no details, I was really shocked and quite disappointed with Nikon.We eventually returned the camera a few days later through a hassle-free process.

From the moment I turned on the camera, I was disappointed.  The screen had a yellow tint to it and while it was quick to turn on and ready to take the shot, the time between shots seemed to take forever......even the digital camera I purchased three years ago seemed quicker.One of the major reasons I purchased this camera was because it boasted of the active child mode.  Between the active child mode, the reviews I read, and a number of it's other features, I mistakenly assumed it would have a quick recovery time between shots. I tried to change settings--with the flash, without the flash.  I added an SDHC 4 gb memory card. Nothing made a major difference.  It was slow. Being a mother of three very active children, I need a camera that can take shots quickly without having to use the burst mode all the time.....this isn't it....When I downloaded the pictures, I wasn't happy any of the inside shots.  Tryng to give the camera the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was the lighting in my home, but most of the inside pictures had the same yellow cast that I saw on the screen.  On the plus side, the outside pics I took seemed fine.Needless to say, within hours of purchasing the CoolPix S610, I was ready to return it. Four days later after giving it a chance, it is packaged back up and will returned tomorrow....even with a restocking fee.I would not recommend this camera to anyone with children that wants to catch all of those precious moments!", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good, convenient little camera", "Author": "LA dreaming", "ReviewID": "R1VXW86DIB1RU7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is easy to use and takes decent pictures.

The features I love is being able to manipulate the picture on the screen (crop, enlarge, lighten, darken etc). I also like being able to take pictures without the memory card in the cam. Often times I forget I've left it in my computer and run out without it. Also I like that there are over 25 settings to capture the right shot such as night time, fireworks, museum, close up, snow, athlete etc. The pictures are clear and the videos look fine too.
