{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A better camera from General Imaging (GE)", "Author": "M. A. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R26FIWJ49PU1FF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the weight and feel of the camera body. You can hold the camera comfortably with out blocking the flash or focus assist light. The flash has a manual release which is convenient. The battery door is spring loaded and releases when pushed sideways. Button and control placement is typical. The back display screen is moderately bright and clear. The display shows enough information about the current operating mode and picture settings to be useful. The Electronic View Finder is clear enough to compose shots even in bright sunlight.  The EVF also displays all the information and images same as the main display when activated.Operating the camera is like most point and shoot models. It allows for fully auto mode, custom scene shots, semi manual modes and a manual mode.  Menu items are simple to understand and cover the basics plus. Various filters and operating modes are available to assist in picture taking process including multi image, HDR+ and 360 degree panoramic.  The continuous drive picture rate is great (5 frames per second) for a low cost camera and like most cameras you can not utilize a flash when taking pictures using continuous drive mode.The camera tries for a lower ISO settings and longer shutter times in auto and semi auto modes. This can lead to blurry photos in lower light situations. The camera does however indicate it needs a flash for the picture when shutter times are long. (The camera will flash the lightning bolt on the screen after focus is achieved if flash is not enabled) If you do not manually pop the flash up then the camera must remain very still. When the flash is enabled the camera seems to wait for flash to charge before it will focus or take a picture.The Video is 1080p Full HD video.  Continuous focus setting will result in videos that move in and out of focus if subject is moving and camera is zoomed in close.  With a little practice it will take very useable video.I find the (P)rogram mode and spot focus settings to be the most reliable for indoor shooting without a flash.  The auto mode appears to have a limited shutter speed and area focus tends to make everything soft focused sometimes.Focus distances are reasonable for the 26x lens zoom range available.  Macro mode is quite useful.  The contrast focus method may take up to 1 second to focus on some subjects. Focus can use spot, area and continuous methods.  Flash range is modest but useable. Pictures are better than expected for this class of camera with regards to lens quality and image noise at ISO levels above 400.This model unlike some previous GE versions now uses a lithium ion battery model GB-60.  The camera comes with a wall charger and cable to allow charging the battery in the camera.  An aftermarket universal camera battery pin charger available here on Amazon will charge the battery out of camera....Owners manual is basic and may not be enough for novice users to understand the options and their results but at least a printed manual is included.I believe the OEM battery GB-60 is the same as an Casio NP-40 battery. I have ordered a couple and will verify.Camera does have a tethered lens cap that will need to be removed and installed manually.Overall camera will produce good photos consistent with a low cost point and shoot camera.07-24-2013:I received two generic brand Casio NP-40 style batteries and can confirm they are dimensionally the same as the GB-60 battery.  Same voltage but larger capacity.  Installed in camera the battery meter works and camera operated normally for a few test shots.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "the rev. \"old hoosier\"", "ReviewID": "RLUP1C2V6ULZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great camera--all the latest features plus 1080p video.  i got mine in white.  get a premium memory card 16 is great--high speed.  if this is your first digital or if you up graded from a point and shoot--spend a few days getting to know this camers--its loaded with options.  the rechargable ion battery is a great feature--much better than theaa or aaa batteries on other cameras--lasts about 4 hrs.  recharger in camera.  if you want to transfer picsor video to a hdtv you need a optional hdtv cord with a micro plug on camera end and a regular hdtv plug on tv end--25 bucks. i was lucky--walmart had the cord .  so the card and the tv cord cost an extra 50 bucks. camera shoots through thick glass like at zoos or aquariums.  takes great action shots of various sports.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive zoom", "Author": "Pringles", "ReviewID": "R2X4FVZ07L8IC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera to use when hiking, so I can zoom in on animals and birds that I see, to better identify them.  As others have stated, you have to be very steady to get clear photos that use the zoom to full effect.  I've taken a number of pictures that have been fuzzy, and aren't really suitable for printing.  But, I have taken a number of pictures of birds that, while lightly fuzzy, have let me identify the bird when I had the opportunity to compare the image to images in bird guides.  I probably wouldn't have noticed certain details if I had just used binoculars, having the picture has made the difference in my being able to id the birds.For clearer pictures while using the optical zoom, I read the manual and set it up so I could use a fast shutter speed.  This has helped me get shots that I can print.I have also found that if I leave the battery in the camera for a few days, it discharges. The battery can last alls day when I'm out taking pictures, but  it drains when the camera just sitsin the case. So I take the battery out and leave it out until I'm ready to take some photos.It's not a perfect camera, but for the price, it's a great tool.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery Operated", "Author": "vadtrav62", "ReviewID": "R1NV0FN5QYBCNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my Kodak battery operated that died after a year.

The zoom got stuck out and wouldn't retract unless I turned the camera off.  I have the General Imaging X500 and was looking forward to the upgrade.  I've kept the X500 and continue to enjoy it.  I would wait until this camera is on the market for a bit.  I had several shots that had washed out backgrounds with no reason.  I know that this company is capable of making a good camera but this one isn't perfected.  Originally I decided to just have the camera replaced.

After playing with it, I finally found out how to record (I make/edit videos). The button for \"quick video record\" sucks a**. The sound and picture are off, it seems like the sound is 2 seconds behind the picture. So I figured the Movie Mode would be best.. Wrong. The picture is ok and there's absolutely no sound. It seems like the picture is slow (you cant move or zoom fast) and there's no sound. I even put it on my computer with volume all the way up and it was silent. I don't know if its cause I'm missing something or what. Everything else is fine but the movie/record videos.. Which is what I wanted a camera for.

It has many features which make picture taking a pleasure and with a case the convenience goes on and on.  I bought this camera for videos as well and was disappointed with the quality of the sound. There is no adjustment. It is set at the factory and if defective which I believe it is, there is really no way to fix it.  With a call to customer service and talk with a technician I was instructed to contact Amazon. Amazon promptly handled the exchange and the second camera had the same problem.  Both have been returned, but I am looking and hoping that the design flaw will be fixed because I really love the camera and look forward to buying it as the design develops.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and Easy to Use.", "Author": "Beady White", "ReviewID": "R1DSHXSJECRHTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful camera!! I've bought and returned several digital cameras over time in search of an affordable camera that would take good up close photos. I use the macro setting most of the time. I also use a tripod and indoor lighting. You have to play around with the camera's different settings to find what will work for you and your needs. It has a lot of really great features like a pop up flash and easy switch from viewfinder to LCD display to see what you are about to photograph. I have absolutely ZERO complaints about this camera. I was insistent on getting a digital camera with a rechargeable battery. I hate fooling with having to replace batteries. The battery life holds very well before needing a recharge.

My Ge X600 was sexy and in a creamy vanilla white. Comes with charger, neck strap(kinda was complicated, so i sat it down for later.) The features was as crisp and simple than baking cookies in the sun. My Favorite mode is the black and white since you can choose your popout colors such as red, blue, green, and yellow. Nearly abused my 16 gb memory card of 86 pictures! Love the moon shots (I'll download it for you somehow..) My family and friends love it, call it the great camera.

I wanted to use an inexpensive camera for the purpose of archiving digital copies of my school notes, credit card bills, excerpts from books I own, and other mundane things.  I own a scanner, but a flatbed is not always convenient, nor is it quick.  I decided that for the purpose I would not be willing to spend more than perhaps $50 or $60.  I happened across this camera selling used for $45 plus shipping, saw that it used a CMOS sensor (supposedly good for less-than-ideal lighting), and took a chance.Even in text mode, the details come out very blurry.  My smartphone (a mid-range Galaxy S variant with a 5 megapixel CCD) takes better pictures than this camera. Although the smartphone is slightly inadequate for the purpose (I do not have enough lighting at home to make it practical), with excellent lighting it can do the job better than this camera can.As a budget point-and-shoot, it's probably nearly as good as an entry-level Sony CCD camera, with fairly good color, and lots of options.  The zoom is impressive.  The electronic viewfinder makes it possible to use the camera in places where the LCD would not be very visible (bright sunlight outdoors, for example).Ergonomically, it's not ideal.  I find myself claw-handling it, which is not exactly comfortable (I have fairly large hands).Honestly, for the price, you would be better off with a Sony WX-xx model (5,9,10,50,70, or 80) or a Canon with a CMOS sensor.  I won't be buying a GE camera again.  Burned once is quite enough for me._________________________________________________________________<Updated>After further fiddling with the camera, I discovered that I was taking pictures in \"Fine\" mode rather than \"Best\" mode.  This made some difference.  To get better detail of the words I figured out how to activate the \"Macro\" mode.  Under good lighting, this allows me to take pictures of sufficient detail and quality to do what I intended to accomplish with the camera, which is to digitally archive my paper materials fairly quickly and conveniently, without having to resort to using my flatbed scanner.  The Sony WX cameras are still better, but for the $50 I spent, this camera seems adequate for the task.  I'm upgrading from 2 stars to 3.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is my third one", "Author": "Denno136", "ReviewID": "R2HR7A0A2KBH77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned three of the GE Cameras and I keep giving them to my family members.

I didnt read the manual first just to test how well the camera would perform without any knowledge of how to work it properly. The first thing i noticed was the LCD screen wasnt as crisp as I wanted it to be.and the picture quality was ok. I didnt use the flash and the light in my livingroom isnt the best. After taking a few more pictures in different lighting, I decided to read the manual and see how the quality of my photos would change. Im so glad I did!!! I love this camera now!!! I changed a few settings and now my pictures are awesome!!! PLEASE READ THE MANUAL!!!!! The only reason I didnt give the camera 5 stars is because I still want the screen to be as crisp as my samsung galaxy. For what I paid for this camera....  will not complain.
