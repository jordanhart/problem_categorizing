It took the worst pictures I had ever seen. At the time it was a lot more than it is now, and it wan't worth what I paid for it, it works ok as webcam, but that is it. A blind person could take better pictures than this thing does. That is no joke. I had to be real up close and personal for the picture to be of any count and in theater you don't want closeups of everything anymore than you do in movies.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Security Camera", "Author": "Marquette Costen", "ReviewID": "R3OIPDDZ2IPWMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in 2008 and liked it because it was light and available, right on my keychain. The picture images aren't all that great and I didn't expect but so much, out of a camera of it's size; what really made this camera great was it's software, it came with a webcam driver that gave it a security function, all I had to do was plug the Jazz right into my Desktop usb, open the webcam app and navigate to the motion sensor, I had a great time playing with the motion sensor, watching what my puppy was doing when I walked out of the room. I'm looking online for the driver of this camera now, wanting to use the security camera feature again, I hope the driver is still available.pros:  Cheap security cameracons: Great lighting, required for picture clarity", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "JUNK !", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R2EV5Q1MSR5YN1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product under a 'Vivitar' label at a local large drug store chain.
