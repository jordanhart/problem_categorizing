{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent compact camera for the price", "Author": "Francis E. Feingold", "ReviewID": "R14FIE7FD8K67D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after extensive research to take with me on a three-month semester in Europe. My main criteria were: 1) low price, 2) good picture quality, 3) short startup and lag time between photos, 4) portability, and 5) good battery life. Over the course of the semester I managed to take a good 1600 pictures of people, landscapes, and artwork in all different settings, and frankly the image quality blew me (and my family) away with its sharpness and vivid color. Lag time was great, much better than otherwise comparable cameras I've used. Battery life was excellent, too; I managed to get through the whole semester  only recharging about four or five times (though this was probably because I tried to avoid using flash as much as possible). Video is quite passable, with decent sound quality. Durability was impressive; I managed to drop it at least twice, once on marble, and it is still in perfect working order.Drawbacks: image stabilization is digital and not, in my experience, particularly useful, so if you're in low light and don't want to use flash you will want a tripod or at least a solid object to steady it on - but that probably goes for most cameras anyway. The autofocus can have trouble in low light or when you're aiming at a hazy horizon for a landscape shot, but otherwise no problems there. The main thing that disappointed me was the lack of manually adjustable options under the \"manual\" setting: it allows you to control white balance and exposure, but that's about it (and even there you have to choose between presets).Bottom line: if you're a pro then this is probably not the camera for you. However, if you're like me and want a portable, inexpensive camera that takes quick, sharp, semi-artistic pictures, then you will be happy with the Finepix A820.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "So much camera for so little money!", "Author": "Vintagegal", "ReviewID": "R2A7GIDUDM7VJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my old Fuju A200.  Having already owned a Fuji, I knew mostly what to expect in terms of quality, but the enormous leap forward from the A200 to this is like going from DOS to a fully integrated Windows environment.  This camera is small - you can fit it in most pockets - but it can do almost all the things a fancier camera can.  The digital zoom is great, and the internal settings which allow you to select different shooting conditions, ISOs, and even take video amazed me.  The LCD is big enough to see clearly in most conditions and can be set brighter or darker as you need.  I never once missed having a viewfinder.  Honestly, I cannot think of anything bad to say about this camera.  Try it, you'll LOVE it!", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Another great Fuji  camera", "Author": "M. Dunlap", "ReviewID": "R3KGX0KRM8RCAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had several Fujifilm digital cameras in addition to Olympus and Samsung.  I can summarize the A820 by simply saying that this is another great camera by Fujifilm.  I love the 4x optical zoom and the multiple memory capability.  If there is anything that isn't great about this camera it would be the location of the mode selector.  It's in a location that would normally be occupied by your thumb when holding the camera.  For this reason it is slighty easy to inadvertently move the dial.  Otherwise, its a great one!", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great does it all camera!", "Author": "H.

Maybe the unit I had was defective, your results may be better.I found that the auto focus was poor, in lower light conditions the auto focus was worthless.

It replaces my excellent A400 because of it's added features, such as the 4X zoom instead of 3X (not a big difference, but enough), as well as all the added scene position choices.  I've done close-ups, portraits, night shots, landscapes and indoor scenes with and without flash, and I'm impressed.  Enlargements are no problem for this camera, either.  It's easy to carry just about anywhere.  Learn to use the ISO settings and scene positions and even get a tiny tripod--the camera will amaze you.Fujifilm Finepix A820 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "upon further review", "Author": "D.

Suddenly, upon turn on, the empty battery icon flashes and it shuts down within 5 seconds. I am using the same batteries and even bought new ones. No deal. Sent it back to Fuji for repair. They sent it back with the same problem. It's a great camera otherwise. Lots of features and video w/sound. But now it just doesn't stay on long enough to use it. Alkalines will last only 8-10 minutes and less with flash. I'll try the repair route again.

I used it maybe four times, and then started having problems with the batteries.  I would take two or three pictures, not even using the flash, and would get a low battery message.  I tried replacing the batteries, with more and more expensive batteries, finally buying batteries advertised as the best for use with digital cameras.  I put them in, took two pictures, and the camera stopped working.  I took the camera to my local photo shop and described the problem. The camera shop employee tried putting his store's batteries in the camera.  One after the other, none of the batteries, no matter how much power they had (he tested them before putting them in the camera) would work in the camera.  He finally suggested that I remove the batteries from the camera when it wasn't being used.  I have owned two other digital cameras before this one, and they both took many, many pictures, including VIDEOS on ONE SET of standard batteries.
