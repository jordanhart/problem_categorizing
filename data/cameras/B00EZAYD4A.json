{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The camera I need", "Author": "A. Nicholson", "ReviewID": "R3O710MXBIDTE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An early review after using this camera for a couple of hours. This jacket-pocketable camera makes good images, gives you control over crafting your photos, and is ergonomically comfortable to use.  Despite the fact that I generally stay away from gimicky scene modes, I was surprised to find a couple of them appealing, including the different options for for panoramas and the color-selective filters.  So far, so good.Let's get my  biases out.  I have Nikon gear (a couple of SLRs) and I would prefer to have my camera work well with existing remotes, flashes, and my old P7000 batteries.  I also like that the camera menus are familiar for a Nikon user and I have a good sense how the Active-D lighting, TTL flash exposure, and general focusing modes work. For me, quick comprehension and intuitive use of these controls greatly increases the cameras performance. I also prefer diopter-adjustable viewfinders due to superior performance in bright light and the fact that with bifocals, focusing on the camera screen can literally be a pain in the neck.I am very pleased with the electronic viewfinder as it shows in the viewfinder the setting changes as you go, just like on the back screen.  I found myself rapidly adjusting settings without looking, being confident that I was getting it right.  The colors in the viewfinder aren't perfect, but it provides more than  enough resolution to thoughtfully compose images.  I found the manual focus  very easy to use compared to other compact-ish cameras I've tried, especially since it can all be done through the viewfinder.I like that the P7800 has a real lens cap, real camera heft, and real controls. Image quality is good in typical indoor lighting scenes without a flash and great outside in good light. My guess is that there those pixel peepers who will take issue with some of the performance in marginal light conditions, and if that is what you care about, you can study the reference photos of toy soldiers, books, coins, feathers, and color charts at other sites.I'm still learning the benefits of the articulating screen, but one that I see immediately is that it can be stowed away when not in use, protecting it from  sometimes rough treatment and the smudges from my nose when using the viewfinder.It's not the snappiest camera recording images, but once on, its responsive to the shutter release (the area of performance I value). It just takes a while to write.  It is faster than my P7000 (though heftier), but nowhere near as fast as my D90. It allows me to get the shots I need when I need them, except for the most demanding conditions (really low light where you need high ISO's, rapidfire sports shooting, serious macro shooting--although the macro focus functions work pretty well).I got this camera to have at all times in my work bag as a daily-use camera so that I won't miss images when traveling for work, commuting, or running errands without the bulk of my SLR. With its viewfinder, good image quality, jacket-pocketable size, ease and familiarity in its use, it is the camera I need.Would I like to have the larger sensor and better ISO performance in it?  yes.  Would I like it to be smaller? yes. Would I like it to be cheaper?  Sure (I could have gotten the P7700 if I didn't prefer viewfinders).  But in the overall compromise of wants for a relatively compact camera, the P7800 is what I need.Update:After having the camera a few weeks, I'm very happy with it.  I was getting frustrated if you have it on one of the \"continuous\" modes or \"Best Shot Selection\" and raw photos, as it will take ~10 seconds to digest the photos, but single shots with raw are recorded pretty quickly.  The viewfinder and the camera heft and overall design and handling makes for working well in marginal conditions, macro shooting, or generally for just carrying around. I find I'm using the button that replaced the dial on top of the P7000 for adjustments more than I used the dial, especially doing it through the viewfinder.  Battery life is good when I primarily shoot with the viewfinder, not having to change the battery over the course of a long weekend and 200 shots even with the flash.  Like other Nikons, the TTL flash exposure works great, and I used it to drive a SB-600 and -700 flash for a few photos of a family dinner, which came out super. Low light performance is better than I hoped, with ISO 800 working pretty well.  Some examples are at my Google+ site, pretty much straight from the camera. [...] . I found the viewfinder nice at the concert, as it is less obtrusive to snap a shot without having to have a screen lit up.I'm very happy to get the performance I get from a jacket pocketable camera.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality photography with the Nikon P7800", "Author": "Moreno Tagliapietra \"fine art photography\"", "ReviewID": "R2ANX757VRINM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: for over 40 years, I have been shooting a wide range of subjects with a great variety of gear - film and digital from compact to 4x5\", natural and studio light -. My main career is in engineering but I regularly sell my fine art prints, do photo restoration and reproduce original 2D/3D craft and artwork. My main system is a Pentax K5 with DA* and DA lenses. I just replaced my go-everywhere Canon G12 with the Nikon P7800 as a truly excellent birthday gift. The camera has more functions that you can shake a stick at but, after having put it through its still photography paces, here are some personal conclusions.The P7800 would not fit in a shirt pocket but it does it in larger jacket pockets or, the way I carry it, in a small pouch together with a spare battery and memory card, my wallet, phone, keys, etc. Given its small size, the ergonomics of the camera are surprisingly comfortable. It feels solid and well made with a good right-hand grip and positive action of all the external controls. The LCD looks great and its articulation is the best on the market - lateral hinge with best range of movement never in the way of the tripod head -.The EVF is the real differentiator though. I was used to the excellent SLR pentaprism viewfinders in comparison with which composing with an LCD is miserable. The P7800 EVF is necessarily small but works really well offering a good, 100% view of the subject and the major camera settings. Once your (nimble) fingers have learnt the position of the camera's external controls, you never need to take your eye off the EVF, even if you wear glasses (I do but they are on a cord and easily removable). The added concentration and stability of this shooting stance are other important advantages. The manual encourages you to use the LCD for a more accurate evaluation of colors.The lens has a record zoom range for this kind of camera even if, photographing a lot of landscapes, I would prefer more on the wide angle side (24mm) than the telephoto. It is also quite bright (a big plus for the autofocus) with good sharpness and low distortion which the camera corrects automatically unless you turn it off and do it yourself in software. I (also) use DxO Optics Pro, whose latest version has the P7800 module for Raw conversion and the results are spectacular.Outdoors: I mostly shoot Raw + jpeg in A mode up to ISO400 to limit noise. I have to experiment some more to learn how far developing in DxO can stretch these limits (supposedly one f/stop). I set Picture Control to Neutral which is the mildest setting and offers the most realistic histogram. Whenever feasible, I choose a mid-way f/stop to limit diffraction (there is still plenty of depth of focus with this small sensor). 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9 formats come all handy with different subjects but one thing that I have learnt at my own expense is that, as a rule of thumb, it pays to shoot a little wider and then final-crop in software. Autofocus is fast enough that I am not aware of it. I typically spot-focus on the subject and lock AF (only) with the AE-L AF-L button, recompose and take the picture. I use realistic HDR when the subject calls for it. The P7800 offers 3 or 5 frames at up to 1 f/stop intervals in exposure bracketing (at 8 fps) which is excellent. Raw continue shooting is up to 6 frames at 4 and 8 fps which is quite fast. Writing speed is on the lazy side and SDHC UHS-1 cards are recommended.  While waiting for my new (inexpensive) speedster, the class 10 card that I am using now is not too bad (about 3sec x frame in  Raw+ jpeg). You can get a quick in-camera HDR picture in Scenes/Backlighting with the camera in Auto and jpeg, and on a tripod. The P7800 exposes automatically up to 30 seconds (60sec in Manual), which is excellent for night photography. I haven't had the chance to try Continuous AF yet.Indoors: the flash has intensity compensation and is good enough for family scenes in typical home spaces. The camera has the ability to drive external Speedlight flashes also with a wireless controller. I do some product photography with an inexpensive diffusion tent and high Color Rendering Index CFL lamps. In this case I shoot with the LCD monitor at ISO80 and f/8. With the AF in Macro Close-up and the Focus Area set to Manual, I can move the focus area around the frame exactly where I want it and then focus in AF. There are three WB manual presets which come especially handy when you shoot jpegs and want a good WB straight out of the camera. Shooting Raw, I include a small gray card in the scene and refine the WB in software. The camera can take several remote control accessories. Image stabilization should be shut off with the camera on a tripod. Shooting at f/8 for max depth of field introduces diffraction (softness) but I can control it in softwareSetup: the camera external controls give direct access to shooting mode, f/stop and exposure time, exposure compensation, flash mode, timer, focus mode, AE and AF block. The Quick Menu brings forth Quality, ISO and WB and you can customize the Fn1 and Fn 2 buttons to your liking.I leave Fn2 on default (it switches LCD info which is especially useful in Playback to jump from full screen to the comprehensive tone level info display). Under the menu Monitor Settings, you can set the LCD to show histogram, grid, and virtual horizon. Furthermore, Fn1 can be set in combination with other controls to your favorite short cuts (ISO, drive?)Output: the proof of the quality of the camera is in the output pudding. I use jpegs to publish on the web and with the Powerpoint training material that I develop. These outputs are not demanding but my fine art prints are. I process my Raw images in Photoshop CS6, resize in Perfect Resize, and get excellent prints on art paper with my Epson Stylus 3800 17\" printer up to 16x24\" (they do make 17x25\" fine art inkjet paper). With subjects that are not sharpness-critical, I can print even larger with my Epson 7600 24\" printer.In conclusion, there is no such thing as a perfect camera but working with the Nikon P7800 is very satisfying, especially due to the EVF, with remarkable output for this small sensor. Unless you do some specialized and demanding photography such as sports and low light, or very large printing, I believe that this camera is not only an excellent go-everywhere replacement for your DSLR but can also be the only camera you need. I do not know where the camera was purchased but I normally buy from Amazon with great satisfaction.05/24/14 updateA few months ago I began doing energy audits of multifamily and commercial buildings. I document my findings with a digital recorder and lots of pictures taken with this camera in often challenging spaces. 8x10\" pictures look great up to ISO800 and dynamic range is wide enough to handle high contrast scenes quite well. Indoors, I have the choice of working without the flash (i.e: reflective surfaces) or with fill flash, and the generous zoom range is very handy to reach mid-distance subjects. There are tight spaces where the EVF or the fully articulated LCD are absolutely indispensable (i.e: reaching the name tag in the back of a piece of equipment close to a wall). The camera fits comfortably in my multi-pocket vest with the rest of my inspector's cool gadgets. All in all, there are certainly smaller cameras than the P7800 but nowhere near as versatile to handle the various subjects of this job which go from wide views of roof tops in good light to high contrast scenes in boiler rooms and small details in dark and crammed corners. It is easy to imagine how well this versatility works for general photography including landscapes, indoor and close-up scenes.01/22/14 updateSo far, Winter by us (New Rochelle, NY) has had some interesting photographic moments with snow and very low temperature. Yesterday evening, I went to photograph the train station with storm Janus in full force. I had with me my awesome Pentax K5 with the 24-75mm and the 75-200mm f/2.8 lenses, everything weatherized. I got one great pic but carrying, handling and keeping this gear warm in the furious snowstorm was a chore. This morning, I was out photographing on the waterfront parks with 2dF (-25dF wind chill) and a glorious sun shining off the billowing snow. I had the Nikon P7800 with me (with a spare battery in my pocket) and took all the pictures I wanted (A mode, Raw + jpeg). With a wrist strap, I was able to keep the camera warm in the pocket of my heavy down jacket between pics. In the sun glare the LCD was totally washed out but the EVF worked like a charm. I have been wearing my glasses on a cord for the longest time and can conveniently drop them when using the EVF which is optically adjustable. With my thin gloves inside heavy glove-mittens, I was able to easily operate all the camera controls. No problems with frozen batteries and gear, everything fit in a pocket, and the rest was pure fun and very good pics. The Nikon P7800 can't touch the Pentax K5 with its DA* lenses in absolute IQ and versatility but there are many situations, even tough ones, where it can definitively hold its own.12/01/13 addendumI have been getting questions about the settings for the Nikon P7800 and thought about writing up a summary of my setup. I mostly shoot Raw + jpeg with the native 3 to 4 format cropped in software if necessary (Qual/ISO/WB  button) at the lowest ISO possible (same button) and auto WB (same button, Auto 1), A mode, f/stop 1/5.6-f/6.3, Focus Area on Center (normal) (press the + button of the multi selector to change it). Relevant Menu settings are as follows.Upper tab: Metering on Matrix. AF Area on Center. Noise Reduction on Low. I keep Distortion Off because I develop in DxO Optics Pro that has its own distortion controls; keep it On if you use Nikon software. Active D-Lighting acts only on jpegs but it looks like Nikon software applies it to Raw files in conversion; I keep it Off; a Medium setting is recommended if you turn it on.  All other settings are on default.Lower tab: Monitor Settings: Image Review on Tone Level; Photo Info on Histogram only (try Virtual Horizon and Grid to see if you like them); Playback/Menus on Monitor or Viewfinder. Self Timer Off. VR On (Off on tripod!). Sound Settings Off (they are loud and not adjustable). AE/AF on lock focus only. Fn1 + Command is awkward and I don't use it. Fn2 on Display (acts on shooting and playback). Everything else is on default.I do use this camera to take studio pics of our flowers and my wife's hand made jewelry. The camera is on a tripod at f/8 with VR Off and Focus Area on Manual. I compose with the LCD, press the OK button, move the Focus Area right on top of the desired focus point with the multi selector, focus in AF and shoot with a 2sec timer (button on multi selector).In Playback, after taking a pic the (excellent) Tone Level screen shows up with histogram and blinking over/underexposed areas (8 different tone distribution segments selectable with the multi selector); semi-press the shutter button to get rid of it. It can be shown again in playback any time by pressing Fn2.Hope this helps (I certainly forgot something). Take lots of pictures.11/24/13 updateI have done some intense landscape shooting with the P7800 in the last several days and the camera has behaved very well. Sensible shooting and Raw development in DxO Optics Pro 9 keeps noise under strict control up to ISO800. With the new $24 SanDisk Extreme Pro 8GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 memory card, 12 MP Raw + jpeg pics write to memory in about 1.5 seconds and 6-frame sequences in 9. Hence, no reason to whine about poor performance. The 200mm zoom comes very handy to me for isolating scene details (i.e.: reflections and cattails swinging in the wind). Easy Panorama and Panorama Assist work as they should but I prefer to shoot panoramas the old way with full camera control and on a decent tripod.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted for a small portable camera with features", "Author": "T. Beck", "ReviewID": "RX5TJILDCVF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for an alternative to having to alway pack my DSLR, lenses, flash units and so forth. I looked at this camera (Nikon CoolPix P7800) versus the Nikon 1 Series and decided on this one based on the following:1. Retractable lens for convenience in packing - lens has effective focal length 28-200mm 35mm equivalent.2. Lens opens to f 2.0 at wide angle, and to f 4.0 at telephoto - a very fast lens for this class of camera.3. Close focusing macro range less than 1 inch at wide angle.4. Built in pop-up flash - also has shoe compatible with all of other Nikon flash units (700, 800, 900)5. Ability to switch from LCD screen to viewfinder screen with a button push for difficult lighting situations.6. The LCD screen is very useful given its ability to rotate for various viewing angles.After I got the camera, I found there were a few limitations to the focus mode, but once you get used to them, it is acceptable. There is an AF mode that focuses at distances more than about 18 inches, a macro focus mode that focuses at very close distances under 4-6 inches, and a mode for focusing in between. The access to the focus modes is convenient and obviously located on the dial on the back of the camera, so I did not find this difficult to adapt to. You have to remember to reset the focus mode when you turn the camera on for the types of shots you want to take.I tried other special features, such as in camera special effects and panoramic stitching. I was especially satisfied with the black and white special effects which gave some interesting high contrast black and white results. It is not my intent to reproduce the information which can be found at the NIkon site, just share my impressions. One feature which really made me happy was the setting that allows me to put the camera into auto iso mode, but restrict the lower and upper range settings. I keep the camera in auto iso 80-800, even thought it can range up to 1600 (3200 in hi iso). The noise of the sensor is quite acceptable in this range (80-800).I bought the additional wifi adapter which allows remote control with a cell phone. Overall, the ability to view, zoom and activate the shutter are acceptable, and would probably be great with the camera on a tripod located many feet away for capturing wildlife. The remote functions are fairly limited, but more than I expected.Features change depending on the setting you are working in, and you have to get used to it. Mostly I shoot in Aperture preferred or Program mode, but all of the options and menus are context sensitive to the mode you are in.Focusing is no slower than you would expect from an electronic point and shoot, but to be sure, this is nowhere near the capabilities of a DSLR. One feature I found very easy and useful to use is it is trivial to set the camera for multiple exposures (-1, 0, +1) and get 3 quick exposures of the same image. Images can be shot in jpg, jpg + raw or raw. As with all new raw formats, I am waiting for Adobe to catch up with this raw format, so all of my observations are based on jpg files.I look forward to taking this with me on my next trip. The size is great, the price is reasonable for this set of features, and there are enough advantages to use this when you want to avoid the buld of your DSLR. I can recommend it.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great little camera with all the control you want", "Author": "J. Verbruggen \"Professional photographer of a...", "ReviewID": "RTYU3Z9Y9UOPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A couple of weeks ago I received a Nikon Coolpix P7800 for testing and to write a review for the biggest photography magazine in the Netherlands: Zoom.nl.  This camera is THE new compact from Nikon. It has a relatively big sensor, with a fast F/2.0 lens and the opportunity to photograph in RAW. According to the press release of Nikon the P7800 is: \u201cperfect for occupations like architects and housing agents where a smaller and lighter camera with high quality is a requirement.\u201d As a photographer of landscape and architecture this made me curious if this little camera satisfies this. So I tested this little powerhouse firmly.In the boxWith opening the box you\u2019ll find besides the camera, a battery with a loader, a strap, a lens cap but remarkably no manual. Intuitively I searched for it on the internet and found it. After that I explored and worked with the camera without consulting the manual. The handling of the camera is easy and logical. But if you really want to know and learn all the options of this camera, I think it is wise to read the manual. Under almost each position of the selector dial (with PMAS, etc.) you will find a different menu, belonging to the selected option. The camera has 2 function-buttons, where you can add the function you want under the tip of your fingers. The big selecting wheel has also 3 user modes where you can combine your own set of settings.The buttons and dials of the camera are all placed logically. It was pretty hard for me to get used to the direction of the lighting compensation dial and the zoom handle. Both should go the other way around for my taste. But if I had used the camera a little longer, I would have get used to that. The dials of the camera feature ridges, which makes it easier to turn them. Even with gloves, as long they are not too thick. This makes the camera also suitable for using it in colder conditions.The supplied DVD contains the relatively simple View NX Software. If you want to photograph in RAW with the P7800 you have to find software, that can handle these files. Adobe has released a \u201crelease candidate\u201d for Lightroom and Camera RAW, which can handle the RAW-files of this P7800. Probably there will be pretty soon an update. If you photograph in RAW you need some patience, because the storing of those files to your memory card can take a few seconds. Not a big problem when you photograph landscape and architecture like me and value quality images. If you need more speed, I advise you to switch to jpeg (fine quality) or choose a different camera like a beginner-DSLR. For this review I photographed exclusively in jpeg  and made always three pictures, one according to the metering, one a full stop under and one a full stop over. Occasionally in some high contrast scenes I made 5 pictures (-2, -1, 0 +1, +2).  With the dial of the lighting compensation you can adjust this further if necessary. Three stops in both directions.In practiceI have tested the camera thoroughly in different circumstances. The camera weighs more than a compact camera that you can put in your pocket. But it can hang around your neck during long walks, without getting neck pain. As a user of a DLSR my first reflex was to look through the electronic viewfinder. If you are used to the big viewfinder of a DSLR, it disappoints. The small format can\u2019t match the viewfinder of a DSLR. I would use it only in situations, where you cannot use the LCD-Monitor. So I used the LCD-Monitor of the P7800 to compose my photos. You can flip this LCD-Monitor pretty extreme and the quality is fantastic! It is 3\u201d inch wide. Even with some sunlight on it, you can still compose your shot. If the sun is bothering you, it is almost always possible to turn the screen in a way that the sun is not bothering you anymore. I really loved to photograph with the virtual horizon and rule of thirds-grid on the LCD-Monitor. Sometimes I had to wobble the camera bit to  get the virtual horizon straight. As an architectural photographer I'm a little obsessed with getting everything level! If you want to photograph all day long and make a few movie clips, for instance on vacation, you need a spare battery. Better two!After pushing the button the camera is fast ready for use. The lens has a range that matches a 28 \u2013 200 mm lens (converted to 35 mm) by F/2.0 \u2013 F/4.0. With such a fast lens and the vibration reduction, you can photograph outside without a tripod, even at the lowest ISO of 80. The smallest possible aperture is F/8.0.You can add a GPS-module, a wireless remote release and a WI-Fi\u00ae-module for sharing your photos. These are all optional.RATINGErgonomics 4,5Functions 5Speed 4,5Image Quality 4Price/Quality 3Pluses:1. Great foldable 3\u201d inch LCD-Monitor.2. Fast lens.3. Photographing in RAW.4.

One type would be a pro or advanced enthusiast who wants or needs the features and controls of a top DSLR but who sometimes doesn't want to carry the weight or wants a backup or is traveling and wants to be confident of handling every challenge; the other target is someone who wants to learn to use those comprehensive features and controls with an easy-to-carry package. It could be argued that this defines a new category of camera: \"micro DSLR,\" with certain threshold requirements, including pocketable size, lots of buttons and dials, RAW shooting, a viewfinder, a flash hot shoe and associated controls, and near professional image quality. That's where the P7800 fits right in. On the other hand, if what you want is a small, shirt pocket camera that's a step up from your smartphone and you primarily use the little green Auto function; if you are willing to trade size, weight, and cost to get a bigger sensor; or if you want a smaller camera with a bigger sensor and proprietary hot shoe and can live without an electronic viewfinder and zoom range (think Sony RX100ii), there are better choices, including the Coolpix P330. You must also accept that the compactness and comprehensive features will raise the price and you have to relent somewhat on image quality. I thought I would share some of the reasons I think the P7800 fills the bill and is worth its price, while laying out some features that might not be apparent and dispelling some misunderstandings. This camera has a lot of functionality, so bear with me.First, The P7800 is indeed a pocket camera in the sense that it will fit in some pockets, like cargo pockets. Having it in a sport coat breast pocket makes you feel like a goodfella. But it is nicely inconspicuous and has a very good grip. Its 1/1.7\" back-illuminated CMOS sensor is small compared to DSLRs', but it's much larger than point-and-shoots'. It does a fine job up to 8x10 prints from JPEG; for the web, it's ideal. I shoot RAW+JPEG. The 12-bit-depth RAW files are 4000x3000 dpi and are 27 MB while the highest quality JPEGs (which are 8-bit) have 4:1 compression and are 5 MB. Compare that to an NEF file from a DX-size DSLR measuring 3892x2605 and 11 MB (because they're compressed), with best JPEG at 7.3 MB. The P7800 has a modern, state-of-the-art image processor and sensor, so it is no surprise that its JPEGs compare favorably to images from not much older cameras with much larger sensors. And its RAW (NRW) files have the potential to be outstanding, except perhaps in terms of low-light noise. All this is helped by the P7800 image ratio of 4:3, which is closer to 8x10 than the 3:2 ratio of most DLSRs and so uses more of the pixels to make a conventional print.You can trim the saturation, sharpening, contrast, and white balance of several available picture control settings, comparing them with a graphical presentation if you like. If this review piques your interest, you can find plenty of sample pictures online to download and examine, and plenty of technical tests at DxOMark and elsewhere to compare. The P7800's 1080HD videos, too, look great, and there are more user video controls than you might expect, including a low-noise zoom for those who zoom while filming. Since the P7800 has a mic input jack with level adjustment, unlike the Canon G16, it actually makes sense to consider it for serious video, including use with a wireless mic (there's an AC adapter available if battery life is a concern). A half-hour video in AVC/H.264 consumes about 4 GB.I compared the Nikon Coolpix P7800 extensively to the Canon PowerShot G16. They have the same size sensors and, though some experts have slightly preferred the P7800's image quality, for me there's not enough difference there to force a decision. Where the Nikon really outscores the Canon is in handling and accessibility of controls. The Nikon's EVF offers full info display and walks all over the G16's limited optical view finder, while the P7800's LCD is fully articulated, not fixed like the G16's--you can even turn it face forward for group selfies, macro setups, or to narrate an instructional video. Neither have touch screens. To let you know the camera is on when the LCD is closed, the ON button lights up (the exposure compensation dial also has an index that lights when it is in use). You might not want to judge color through the EVF, but it is 100% frame accurate and the info display, including live histogram, is very readable so there is no need to refer to the LCD while shooting.The P7800 has the kind of controls you would expect of a pro DSLR, or better; often they are customizable in useful ways. White Balance, for example, offers two Auto modes, seven presets, a mode that lets you directly dial in Kelvins with live display, and a manual (grey card) mode saved to three additional custom presets; this is handy when you encounter weird lighting, such as \"white\" LED light banks or CFL. Each mode has a fine trim adjustment using a Yellow-Blue vs Green-Magenta graph.There are three custom setups available on the mode dial, in addition to Nikon's My Menu function; when you are using one, its settings appear in its own menu. There are many more places to customize functions and image processing, with graphs and helpful explanations. Amazingly (in the past I have groaned at Nikon firmware) these functions are really easy to access and make use of.The camera has two thumbwheels (in addition to the main rotary selector dial) that normally control the f-stop (2 to 8) and shutter speed (1/4000 to 60 sec). You can assign them many custom functions when combined with the Fn1 button. When used this way, the display shows icons that remind you how you set them up. I often change metering mode between Matrix, Center Weighted, and Spot, as these control functions in the SB-700 flash, so though metering is a single button press to get to it in My Menu, setting it as an option for Fn2 makes it super easy. The G16 has only one such dial; to control shutter speed you sometimes but not always use its rotary selection dial. The Fn2 button next to the P7800's shutter release can be assigned to turn off info in the display, turn on virtual horizons in the display, hide the histogram, hide the framing grid, or turn on the 3-stop ND filter--with one press. The G16 has no Fn buttons.The ISO can be set from 80 to 3200, plus Hi1 (6400). In addition to full Auto, you can limit the upper Auto value to 200, 400, or 800. That's very thoughty.The P7800 offers three ways to deal with high dynamic range subjects. It offers D-Lighting which can be applied to already shot JPEGs or Active D-Lighting which can be turned on for JPEGs as they are shot, both in three strengths (in my experience: not enough, about right, and too much). Some shooters leave ADL always on at low strength. There is also a \"Backlighting\" scene mode which you can jump to with a twist of the mode control knob to SCENE. This mode invokes multi-shot HDR, in three strengths, as you shoot JPEGs. If you want to do HDR yourself in post, you can select 3-shot or 5-shot bracketing at .3 or 1 stop steps (these also work in RAW). You can bracket using shutter speed, f-stop, ISO, or white balance.Let me address a few issues that some have turned up their noses at. First, the button to turn on the EVF. I've never used it, because the EVF turns on automatically when you fold the LCD display towards the camera body, which is how I use it. If you open the LCD to check images, the EVF turns off automatically. Next, lack of WiFi. This isn't a big issue if you have a tablet or laptop nearby because swapping SD cards is very fast. The only function of the Canon G16 WiFi is to transfer selected already-shot JPEGs to another WiFi node, such as your smartphone, from which you can then transfer them elsewhere. If you need that functionality, your options include the WiFi adapter, WiFi card reader, or an EyeFi SD card, which allows transfers to specific web sites, setting permissions, and other functions. The P7800 has a menu option for EyeFi cards (but you still need a WiFi hot spot). NFC per the Sony RX100 is what you really want for wireless transfer. Requiring a GPS add-on is an asset, because that gives me a remote control port. You can plug in a YN RF-603N with YN-N3 cable and get a cheap, radio, two-step remote shutter release with multiple flash control, or if you need sophisticated intervalometers, there are plenty of inexpensive options that plug right in. And finally, comments on slowness: I typically shoot RAW+JPEG at full resolution and, though I do use a very fast, Class 10 SD card (why not?) I don't find myself waiting on the camera. It is certainly faster than flash recharge. Choosing the option to view a shot for a couple of seconds after it is taken also slows things down, but that can be turned off. If you do rapid continuous (as opposed to burst) shooting, which I don't do or know anyone who does with a compact camera, you should do some hands-on tests, as \"fast\" can be subjective. True, if you shoot a six-frame burst in RAW+JPEG, the P7800 locks up for 15 seconds while it process the burst. The Canon also slows way down shooting RAW, and for me it drifted in and out of focus if Autofocus was enabled in continuous shooting, so there's no perfect solution. The P7800 autofocus, by the way, is faster than most, but it could be faster--but what camera's couldn't?Of course the Canon G16 has many of these functions as well. What makes the Nikon far preferable for me is that the P7800's functions are more likely to be readily accessible on a physical knob or Fn button rather than somewhere in a menu that can be hard to see in bright daylight (I sometimes shoot ski mountaineering). I'd say the controls are more usable than most DSLR's and the overall ergonomics are excellent. The EVF is something I couldn't live without, and the G16's optical VF pales in comparison and is a real pain if there's something in the hot shoe. Same with the extra zoom range; I often shoot portraits or body shots at over 100 mm, so I appreciate the 7.1x zoom, a bit more than the G16's 5x. The Canon has focus peaking to aid manual focus, which works well on high-contrast areas; the Nikon manual focus aid uses a zoomed-in area in the center of the live frame and allows you to start with Autofocus there and then trim it; for me, that works better and gives me more control, particularly when shooting macros. I find I use the pano assist function more than I would have thought, because it works really well and is easy to use; the Canon doesn't have pano functions. Both cameras have various special effects and post processing functions that might be amusing; Background Defocus works nicely, but I have yet to try Pet Portrait. Mostly I don't use them. Image quality might be a tie, but the Nikon has enough hands-on advantages that it was ultimately not a hard decision.Anything I don't like? Not much. I'd like to see an option for AdobeRGB color space for JPEGs, but since I mostly shoot RAW, that's not a bother (RAW can be processed in the camera, if needed). At the moment, in my Linux environment, NRW thumbnails show up as TIFF files (which is basically what a RAW file is, with additional metadata); annoying to have to use the same-named JPEG for reference (which is not Nikon's fault), but the files themselves open just fine in various Free-and-Open-Source applications that are available for Linux, such as showFoto and UFRaw, but RawTherapee wants a profile. [I would strongly urge serious photographers to investigate Linux photo applications, including the GIMP, which I have come to prefer to Photoshop/Lightroom. You'll save enough to buy a P7800!] Photoshop CS5 wouldn't open NRW files at all, but the camera comes with ViewNX2 (Windows, Mac, Linux in WINE) which will do  basic conversions to TIFF or JPEG, or try Picassa or Google+, or you can buy Bibble or Capture One (search \"raw image file format\" on Wikipedia for the latest). The 40.5 mm filter size is a pain.And the P7800 doesn't work perfectly with the affordable Youngnuo flashes, like the YN565 and YN468ii (which is their fault); for example, the YN468ii  in TTL mode tracks the camera's focal length and f-stop, but the flash power is all or nothing, so it becomes a manual flash that tracks f-stop and zoom. Commander mode in the camera doesn't get a response, at least for me, but S1 and S2 are fine because they don't depend on the camera at all. The camera doesn't recognize some flash remotes, like the Youngnuo RF-603N, until you set its Flash Control from Auto to External Flash; then all is fine. The Nikon SB700 works perfectly, of course, except for no AF assist light; it reports that the P7800 works in CLS and AWL, and it responds in Commander mode if it is set to Group A and Channel 3... but it costs 2/3 of what the camera does and it's physically larger. Because of the way the P7800 \"shutter\" works, flash sync is maintained at all shutter speeds, all the way up to 1/4000--without having to use high speed sync (which Nikon calls Auto FP High Speed Sync on their cheap $6000 DSLRs). This is even better than HSS, because it causes no surprises by changing with shutter speed and it can be used to trigger slave flashes, which HSS can't. High speed shutter sync is essential when you're trying to balance fill flash with wide f-stop in bright conditions. Speaking of flash, the Gary Fong 4/3 Puffer works just fine on the built-in flash.All in all, I love this camera and I'm more and more reserving the tonnage of my DSLR kit for when it's absolutely needed. Now I shoot Hasselblad or Sinar film when it's demanded, and have fun with the P7800 when I'm shooting for fun, family, or the web, knowing it has the tools for every situation. Horses for courses. It's said that the best camera in the world is the one you actually brought along, and the P7800 makes its choice inviting. Like everybody who gives 5* reviews, I'll end by saying that I made a brilliant purchase decision, and you should too.LINUX addendum: If you're interested in using Free-and-Open-Source software, there are plenty of high quality options available. I checked which ones open NRW files produced by the P7800. These include LightZone, Fotoxx, Darktable, and digiKam. Most are 16-bit, preserving the 12-bit RAW from the camera. They can output 16-bit PNG or TIF files which can be further edited in GIMP, which now handles 8-, 16-, and 32-bit fixed or floating point precision, including importing 16-bit PSD files. The first programs are comparable to Lightroom and the GIMP compares favorable to Photoshop, though its learning curve is just as daunting. I run mostly on Ubuntu Linux, which will be immediately familiar to Mac users, so I don't know how the Windows and OSX versions perform. I use Windows only when some unusual requirement forces me to use Photoshop. There are FOS programs for HDR work, too, including Luminance HDR and Fotoxx after v14. There are HDR plugins for the GIMP using exposure blend and there's a cool tone mapping add-on. All free.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pleased with this purchase", "Author": "George B.

It is pocketable, but not shirt-pocketable, which is ok for my needs (I don't have/use a smart phone camera other than the Nexus 10).  I could have gotten by with less, but wouldn't have been happy.  The picture quality is far better than adequate.A significant use for me is taking pix of homeowner DIY projects, especially quick snaps under sinks or in the crawl space under the house, or underneath a vehicle:  the articulated screen really comes in handy for such project documentation and pre-planning. (If you have joint issues, this may be important. <g>)The exposure compensation dial is a little looser than I'd like, making it a little too easy to accidently change the setting.  And I'm not a fan of the lens cap, knocks off a little to easily.  Otherwise, the camera seems to be really well built -- so far, anyway.The EVF is really just for aiming and general composition; it won't help with judging color or similar attributes.  And as an eye glass wearer, I really like the diopter adjustment.I use the SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s, the same as I use in my Nikon D7000, and I have no complaints with the camera's shooting speed, whether jpeg or RAW (NRW).I do recommend a spare battery, I'm not sure if I fully trust the battery minder, sometimes it seems to jump rather quickly from maybe 75% charge to less than 25%.  But that may be because I tend to fiddle with the settings, zooming the playback, etc. As a firm believer in Murphy's Law, I always carry a spare.It's priced higher than it should be compared to DSLRs, but then there really is no other camera that has all of these features.

Mostly the two things that I noticed was the height a little more than the P7700 because of the viewfinder, absent before, so the P7800 brought back the feature that was in the P7100. However, the P7100 had one that is like the Canon G16; tunnel-style. Did Nikon go with Canon's G series for the P7100? Anyway, the viewfinder on the P7800 is electronic, but it does have an odd color change depending on the angle or position your eye is looking into it; more so on the left or right it makes blues appear greens, but accurate more so in the center. Think the polarity between the viewfinder-screen and the piece you look through is off balance, and this may be a problem, since other cameras do not have this phenomenon.The other thing is that the dial on the P7700 that is now absent on the P7800 thanks to the viewfinder, is instead a button to the right (the left button changes from EVF to display; does nothing if the flip-out screen is closed inward where you normally should store it to protect the screen). The right button, that is above the flip-out display, does what the dial does--allows you to change the ISO and other settings. This is easier and faster, but navigation takes a little getting use to, but I think Nikon did well in this regard.However, I am not giving this camera five stars, but four, because the image quality and image stabilization appear a bit less-good than that of the P7700. The photos on the P7700 were very sharp--and that is saying something from the already great quality on Sony RX series, namely the RX100 and its updated M2 version. The image stabilization on the P7700 was also mostly trouble-free. However, the P7800 seems to have better (improved) autofocus. The P7700 sometimes focused on the wrong subject and hunted a lot more than so the P7800 does. This may have been a firmware issue though. Compared to Sony RX and their NEX line, the Nikon certainly is a lot more accurate \"focusing on the intended subject,\" and much more accurate taking a photo with a flash. RX is extremely weak in this regard, usually resulting in mostly a blurry night shot with the flash because its 3-D algorithm and focus points do not seem to calculate with its bokeh, if I am even getting to the point that this is guesswork. The new Nikon cannot even get a focused shot at full telephoto in very low light; Sony RX100 does well with this if you are very still. This is probably because the Bionz processor and Exmor sensor are more powerful. However, the image stabilization is about as \"good\" as the autofocus without the flash, regardless of the lighting.Back to the screen, but the flip-out one, has a few \"stuck\" or \"bad\" pixels. This has not been an issue on other cameras, but due to the precision electronics thing during the manufacturing process. Nothing is perfect--so far. However, the display having stuck pixels has no effect on the photo, but I have noticed that in very low light, Sony and Nikon have whitish marks in the photos, but it could be nearby dust in front of the lens. Again, not anything to do with the display. However, if you set your computer's video display card (graphics card) to 256 colors, your printer will not print the so-called \"16 million\" colors. Irrelevant, but to avoid confusion.Video quality is still noisy in low light as on the P7700. Using the ND filter makes the video look darker and does not correct the noise levels. Do not use the ND filter. I do not know what it is but do not like what it does!Would I recommend this camera if you already have P7700 and got by without a viewfinder? No. Save your dough. It goes to show that the photos are very sharp, focused, and very low noise on the screen, but when you copy the photos to a computer, the computer's display is far superior and accurate to the premise of the screen on a camera just to get a good look in-camera shots. This was not an issue on the P7700, as the photos would look the same on the P7800, but the P7700's actually represents WYSIWYG on your computer as well. It is well-known that phones, such as Android and iPhone have very clear images on their very fine-res displays, but on the computer, they look quite mushy.Do not let a computer fool you--go view photos of the camera on photo blog sites before buying the camera. I did this with the P7800 and they looked fine on that site, but in my personal experience, I know they were not optimized or altered, which you cannot tell unless specified on the site. Even I read somewhere that the P7800 had blurrier photos than on the P7700.Well, for the money, this camera is OK, but not in the same league as its predecessor. I would suggest that you buy the P7700 because of what has been addressed, especially if it is cheaper.
