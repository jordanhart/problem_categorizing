{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exeptionally good design tradeoffs; second to no competitor in image quality", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2TBZQ4NQQECLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To add to other reviews here, let me highlight the differences between the GM1 and the larger Lumix GX7 introduced this year which has the identical, excellent, image sensor. General comments on why I chose the GM1 over other \u00b54/3 cameras at the end. I'll borrow liberally from information available in several online reviews.First, although the sensor is identical (and available image quality identical to the very well reviewed GX7), there are a few differences in capabilities (both better and worse):1. The GM1 can achieve 1/16,000 maximum shutter speed. The GX7 can do 1/8,000. Although not useful in most shots, it is equivalent to having an extra stop of built-in ND filter for wide open aperture shots in bright light. (There is not built-in ND filter, but such a fast maximum shutter speed achieves the same benefit).2. The flash sync is 1/50 on the GM1. (In my view this is just not a concern. Anyone looking for flexibility andperformance in flash photography is not interested in a compact camera without a flash hotshoe like the GM1. However, the pop up flash can be held tilted up towards the ceiling, so the most useful application of a flash as bounce fill, in my view, is built right in conveniently.)3. There is no bulb exposure available (e.g. shutter open for as long as you need). This is because the sensor needs to dissipate heat, and in a small camera body it's hard for the CMOS chip to dissipate heat for more than a minute. How often do you use exposures >one minute?4. There is only 1080/60i video, not 60p. Same reason as above--60p generates more heat than the small camera body can effectively dissipate. With that said, you can choose H.264 as a codec and 24p for very easily editable, movie like HD video.5. The GX7 has in-camera image stabilization that can help with lenses without built-in image stabilization. Almost all Panasonic \u00b54/3 lenses have built-in stabilization, however, and the GM1 therefore does not have stabilization in the body. This is identical to SLR digital cameras where the lens manages the image stabilization. The GX7 has a potential advantage in this area when used with Olympus \u00b54/3 lenses without stabilization, but to me the advantage would rarely be useful. In low light scenes where stabilization can be helpful I'm usually taking pictures with people or animals in them. I need the shutter speed to be fast enough so they are not blurred; stabilization in the camera/lens doesn't stop them from moving. Others may find that having stabilization in a non-Panasonic lens is valuable for their needs.6. On a significant positive note, the electronic shutter on the GM1 greatly reduces (effectively eliminates) vibrations typical of fully mechanical shutter curtains (on the GX7 and many other \u00b54/3 cameras) that can (in some circumstances) induce slightly blurring vibrations (of a type that are not reduced by image stabilizing systems). This is not going to be a concern for the vast majority of shots, but the review site Imaging-Resource has concluded: \"With the Panasonic GM1 and its electronic first curtain, though, this vibration problem should go away completely. There's no first curtain to slam into the bottom of the shutter assembly, and the very light second curtain being driven via the stepper motor should contribute little or no vibration as well. (Given this, we'll probably swap out the GX1 test body we're currently using for SLRgear lens tests in favor of a GM1...\"I hope that adds some useful technical information to the basic observation that this is just a smaller GX7 with fewer direct controls via buttons and dials, elimination of the electronic viewfinder, and removal of the tilting LCD screen.So why choose the GM1 over the GX7? It's a matter of personal preference and habit, really. My reasons are1. I travel a good bit and want a small camera bag. With the GM1 I save a good bit of volume in the camera body without losing anything in image quality compared to the GX7 or my Canon 60D SLR.2. The GM1 looks a lot more like my Leica M6 (albeit smaller) than the GX7 (just in body style, aesthetics).3. The GM1 (especially the black model not offered yet for U.S. sale) will look just like another point and shoot to most people. This will put people more at ease, let you get it into places that are wary of professional cameras, and enable more intimate photography. The GX7 stands out more (relatively speaking).4. The GM1 bundled lens is excellent. It is truly excellent. Unless you need wider apertures, it will be a go to lens.5. I do not have an interest in an electronic viewfinder (even though I happily used my optical M6 viewfinder).6. I do not have a strong concern to have a tilting screen. If the GM1 version 2 has a tilting screen it would be an improvement in my opinion, but it's not critical to me.7. I have no interest in a hotshoe for attaching an external flash.8. I have little interest in the 60p vs. 60i or 24p HD video. I will use the video on the GM1 happily; it will be clearly better than my iPhone.A final note. I looked at a lot of photographs from the GM1 online. The noise at higher ISO looks like natural, fine grain in film: analogue and contributing to the mood and expressiveness of the photograph. The color balance is very well controlled: many Olympus cameras produced more yellow-tinted jpegs in side by side comparisons (although that can be corrected, with time and effort in RAW editing). And the microcontrast and ability to capture subtle difference in color hues reminded me very much of my Leica M6.I can certainly see that given different priorities and tradeoffs, the GX7 or one of the Olympus \u00b54/3 cameras might be a preferable choice for someone, but the GM1 is exceptionally well designed by Panasonic to preserve image quality and performance, maintain high standards of construction and durability, and reduce bulk compared to any other \u00b54/3 camera.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Micro 4/3 pocket camera I've always wanted", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R1X8651E1XV910", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Christmas came early for me when somebody (who shall remain nameless) left my Olympus PEN E-PM1 on the top of my car. Somewhere around 60 miles per hour, the camera shuffled off the roof and into oblivion, which suddenly placed me in the market for a replacement.I've used Micro Four Thirds almost since its inception, upgrading bodies periodically as notable improvements found their way into the system. I have and still use the larger Olympus OM-D E-M5 which I greatly enjoy, but I really like having a smaller body with a pancake lens for family events and other situations where discretion and size win over ergonomics. I also find that a simple camera like the E-PM1 is easier to hand to the family member (who, again, shall remain nameless!) while generating good results from the automatic modes. The E-M5 can be a bit overwhelming due to all of its bells and whistles.It was serendipitous that the GM1 was announced right around the time of \"the E-PM1 incident;\" even smaller than the E-PM1, new sensor, touchscreen, wifi, more buttons, flash... the list goes on. I waited for it to come out, and received my order on the very day before we left for our holiday vacation.Out of the box: good golly, it's SMALL! I mean, you know it's small by looking at photos online, but it just really does not do the thing justice. It's small enough that I can wrap the camera in a single hand, and indeed I normally shoot with my thumb wrapped around the left side of the body and my fingers around the right. The rear LCD is partially obscured by my hand in this configuration but I can see enough to get by, and it's very secure.Unlike the other very small Micro 4/3 bodies, Panasonic didn't totally skimp on the dials with this one. We have a proper focus mode dial, a hard FN key in the middle of it, a convenient on/off switch, and a proper mode wheel. Yay! These little physical dials are minor details that the GF series and E-PM series had been curiously omitting for a while, and it's good to see their return in this miniscule camera.The touchscreen is really beautiful and works surprisingly well. A new (to me) addition for the UI is a \"FN\" menu on the right, which allows you to add virtual FN buttons of your choosing for easy access - I love it a great deal. Very convenient.I'm happy to report that the kit lens is... pretty serviceable! Subject isolation is very difficult (at 64mm f/11 equivalent, unsurprisingly so), but if you're just looking for good resolution and detail it delivers. The 12mm wide end is especially nice to have around; in fact, this *zoom* lens is smaller than my 14mm pancake prime I'd been using before, and only a stop slower. It's pretty amazing what they can cram into such a tiny package. A few things of note: it feels really flimsy when not mounted (it actually rattles a bit), it has to be extended a bit before it can be used, and it has no focus ring (only a zoom ring). Manual focus with the kit lens on the GM1 is only possible using the touchscreen, making it really frustrating to be perfectly honest; you really should stick to AF with the kit zoom.Oh, that's no indictment against other lens focusing though; this camera has focus peaking! And the CPU is fast enough so there's really no lag to speak of. It's a joy to use this body with your old manual focus lenses.Other than the diminutive size and the teensy tiny lens, probably the most intriguing thing about the GM1 is its electronic shutter. The mechanical shutter is only capable of speeds up to 1/500, which is inadequate for outdoor shots with large apertures, and if you shoot at higher speeds the GM1 goes into full on electronic shutter mode. I found this to actually be incredibly handy, and found myself using the 20mm f/1.7 wide open in broad daylight with speeds up to 1/16000s! In some cases, you do notice a \"rolling shutter\" distortion, but 1) it's not always visible and 2) even when it is, it's not really a big deal. The compromise the GM1 strikes, with the ability to complete avoid the effect by using the manual shutter at speeds under 1/500s, seems pretty reasonable to me.The sensor in this camera is every bit as good as the E-M5. Maybe better? To be frank, it's now irrelevant. Both cameras with a fast prime are good enough that any differences are meaningless. The GM1 does lack in body image stabilization, which is a loss felt mostly in video.I also think the JPEGs look good out of the box with this camera! Panasonic has been maligned for default JPEG settings which lack \"pop\" or have weird auto white balance, but I really think you can shoot JPEG with the defaults and get good results with this guy.Oh, and the thing even has a lil bitty flash. Sync speed is only up to a measley 1/50s, limiting its use as daytime fill, but it can be handy in dim light. The best thing about the flash, though, is that it can be held backward to bounce - a trick that I completely adore from Panasonic's cameras.The GM1 also has this crazy wi-fi thing. I decided to test it with my Android smartphone along with the Panasonic image app, and I was surprised to find it potentially useful. Not only can you play back and download captured images (only 10 at once though, alas) with your phone, you can also remotely control the camera with full live view on the phone, which will no doubt be invaluable for selfies and situations where you might want to place the camera in an awkward location.So! Here are the big takeaways:* I dig the dials on the top and the customizable FN button* sensor is quite good compared to the E-PM1* kit lens? Pretty OK!* I really like the popup's ability to bounce. I *don't* like the paltry 1/50 max flash sync speed, but what can you do?* I'm not yet clear on what effect the rolling shutter artifacts will have on my life, but at this time I rather like having the ability to shoot at very high shutter speeds!* I actually really like how the camera feels in hand with the \"one hand wraparound\" style grip. It sounds like it would be awkward but it works well. Adjusting settings when using this grip requires a repositioning, though.* Speaking of that, I find the wheel on the back far too inclined to \"click\" rather than spin. I seem to accidentally hit the directions rather than spinning a good bit. I wish this instead had a thumb wheel like the old E-P2 or something.* Wi-fi? Maybe not totally a gimmick?* Price? Well, it's high, but it's not *that* high to start at.I think the GM1 is a winner - it's the small M4/3 camera I've been waiting for, and it should have broad appeal to both casual shooters looking for a P&S; replacement and E-M1/GH3 type shooters looking for a no-compromises tiny second body.EDIT 05/2014:After almost five months, this camera has proven to be everything I hoped for. I almost never use my E-M5 now; indeed the only things I really miss from that camera are the in-body image stabilization and the wireless flash capabilities.I'm also happy to report that the GM1 kit lens has really surprised me in a good way. I initially kept it around mainly for the image stabilization (for video), but it now ends up getting a whole lot of use when the light is good and I don't care about subject isolation. The 12mm wide end is especially nice to have in something so tiny.I have read that Panasonic will not release a GF series camera this year. I'm not disappointed by that one bit. If the GM1 is a sign of Panasonic's strategy moving forward, I can't wait to see what they come up with next.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's the camera we've been waiting for!", "Author": "Dr. Atomo", "ReviewID": "R9ANWFMD4Z605", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had to order the all black version from Hong Kong at a premium.  I believe Panasonic is trying to differentiate their product from the rest of the high end compact offerings in the U.S. with their stylish two tone scheme, but I worried about the silver coating wearing over the years.  I take meticulous care of my tools and want them to stay looking good.In retrospect and with respect to the commenter Charles I changed \"silver paint\" above to \"silver coating\" and will add that I had read somewhere that the lens was constructed with plastic.  I had visions of a silver paint scratched off a plastic lens.I needn't have worried. The part of the lens that would get most of the wear is definitely metal and the extensions may be a tough composite or may be magnesium... they are a different temperature than the other metal when cool.So, if you like the two tone, I would say the silver finish should be plenty durable.I am not going to address Image Quality in this quick review as the other sites have already affirmed that the Image Quality is nearly identical to the acclaimed Panasonic GX7, in a word, remarkable!Instead I want to address the usability, as the User Interface is why I have been using Panasonic cameras since the GF1.The build quality of the GM1 is good, very lightweight but solid.Comparing this camera to my GX1, it is a obviously a lot smaller but also feels much less dense.While the GX1 has a button for every control imaginable, except a the Depth of Field Preview button- (for which you can designate a Function button) the GM1 has relatively few buttons.I bought this camera on faith because I love the Panasonic GUI.  I hoped that even with the very slimmed down controls I would be able to customize the camera to do what I wanted with a minimum of menu diving.  (I hated the the menu diving in the Canon S95 I bought and quickly traded it for an LX5).I was counting on selling my GX1, and just keeping the GM1 and Nikon D800e.So, is the GM1 a GX7 in an LX5 (RX100) body?There is one physical programmable Function button which I programmed to bring up the ISO settings.  This gives me most of the controls I want since there is already a White Balance button.Update: I have since found that a touch screen Function button works better for me when switching ISO on the fly and have reprogrammed the Fn1 button to AF/AE.There are six programmable software Function buttons located on a sidebar tab on the touch screen and a customizable Quick Menu button for control of many settings depending on the Mode Dial.  So far I set one of my Function buttons to Silent mode for taking photos of my reticent seven year old!Some of the Q. Menu settings available are:1) Photo Style. (Film Mode) which is a set of jpeg processing algorithms.  You can choose from one of Panasonic's many pre-configured styles or customize your own.  In Intelligent Auto or Intelligent Auto Plus your only choices are Standard or Monochrome (Black and White).2) Picture Setting. A combination of Aspect Ratio and file size (pixel count) and Quality, where your choices are Raw and/or JPEG Fine or Standard.  I always choose Raw and Fine although this takes up the most space on my SD card.  Usually the jpeg is fine but I have a RAW file to adjust if needed.3) Sensitivity. (ISO)  When the mode dial is set to Intelligent Auto/ Intelligent Auto Plus you are locked out of the ISO settings unfortunately.  The camera will pick an ISO setting for you all the way up to 3200 (1600 when the flash is active) by which time there is noticeable degradation in the Image Quality as can be seen on the Digital Photography Review Low Light Studio Comparison tool. ~[...]I would prefer to be able to set an upper limit on ISO while in I.A. like on the GX1 and in my other cameras.In P and A you have full manual control of your ISO from a base 200 up to 25600.  You can specify an upper limit to the ISO in these modes.  Go to, Menu, Record, ISO Limit Set.Or you have the choice of Auto ISO or Intelligent ISO.  The difference is that when in I.ISO the camera can vary the shutter speed after even the shutter is half pressed for metering/focus.In S mode you still have access to Auto ISO but not I.ISO because I.ISO can vary the shutter speed.When in M mode there is no access to Auto ISO, which I believe is an important oversight. I like to be able to control everything but let the camera set the ISO up to a maximum I set like on my Nikons.Also when setting the ISO the Exposure Bar is not in view so you have to guess at the proper setting, further complicated by the lack of a dedicated ISO button.(I called Panasonic with my questions about the limitations on ISO settings and was told to write the following address with firmware requests!  Please write ~ consumerproducts09@us.panasonic.com ~ and request a firmware update on these important problems!)4) Metering Mode. Multi, Center Weighted and Spot.  Not available in the I.A. settings, where I presume the Multi-Metering mode is used.  I usually prefer Spot Metering when using the \"Focus (meter) and Recompose\" method of shooting.5) Flash Mode.  Only available in the Custom Settings.  Your options here are Forced Flash On, Forced On/Red-Eye, Slow Sync. and Slow Sync./Red Eye.6) Various Movie Modes.7)  Auto Focus. Single or Flexible, where Flexible will follow focus on your subject even when the shutter is halfway pressed.Also available in the Quick Menu Custom Setting Modes are Exposure Compensation and White Balance, though there are dedicated buttons on the outside of the camera for these functions.The lack of physical buttons and the plethora of controls make for a distinct learning curve.  I am going to need a few days for this camera to become second nature...The camera is much smaller than even the Panasonic GX1, which is what I was looking for and the manual controls are there for the finding.  The files look good as promised and the flash and white balance are very nicely handled.The tiny 12-32mm lens is nice.  I do appreciate the lack of zoom motor.  I really hated the lack of zoom ring on the 14-42mm PZ!  I sure do wish the 12-32 had a focus ring.Manual focusing is a little strange.  I believe there is a typo in the PDF manual.  To use the Manual Focus on the 12-32mm lens you first switch the top lever/switch to MF, then press Left on the scroll wheel on the back of the camera.This will pull up your manual focus screen with a magnified box enclosed in a yellow rectangle with arrows on the outside.  This box can be dragged around the screen or moved up, down, left, or right by pushing on the respective sides of the scroll wheel.Rotating the Scroll Wheel (Control Dial) changes the size of this Focus Subject Box.Here is where the manual is misleading. To actually adjust the focus you need to push the Menu/Set button or press the \"Set\" button displayed on the right bottom of the screen.This brings up a scroll bar which works ok but I changed it to work with the scroll wheel through Menu, Custom Settings, Lens W/O Focus Ring, Control Dial. You can choose to use the Control Dial to change the Focus or Magnification Level of the focus box.  There is also a separate static magnification level also under the Lens W/O Focus Ring setting.Thankfully the much touted Focus Peaking actually works, and works well!  I tested the Manual Focus with Peaking on the text of a book in low light at a distance of several feet and was astounded at the accuracy!In all the manual focus is much better implemented than on the 14-42mm PZ, Panasonic's other collapsable zoom lens option.  I hated both the zoom and the focus nubs on that lens, and the manual focusing in the GM1 seems easier than I remember the GX1 being aided by the focus peaking.The 12-32mm is also much smaller in diameter than the 14-42mm, though when collapsed they are about the same depth.The auto focus \"touch to focus\" works well and very quickly, though you have to touch your focus point, then half press the shutter which is a little clunky.  I would like it to focus on the fly.I have found the \"Silent Shutter\" to actually work very well.  My son has developed an aversion to my many photographs of him. Using the silent shutter has allowed me to photograph him successfully.  This mode disables the physical shutter and just uses the electronic shutter.  It also disables the Focus Assist Light, but the camera seemed to have no problem finding focus in less than ideal conditions.The Artificial Horizon or Digital Level, which Panasonic calls the Tilt Sensor and is very handy is easily found by pressing the Disp. button.I tried unsuccessfully for an hour or so to get the camera to connect to my Samsung Galaxy S4 via Wi-Fi.  It would occasionally connect but wouldn't transfer photos or let me control the camera via phone.  I'll keep trying.Wi-Fi Update: (Check the comments below.)Battery life is pretty poor, another trade-off for the size I guess.  In fact I went through a full battery just referring to the menu for this review.  Hopefully there will be some aftermarket batteries available soon!This is the camera I have been waiting for!  Truly pocketable with a large sensor and full manual controls!Its a great, tiny camera that actually fits in a shirt pocket, though it does make an unsightly bulge!  The collapsible 12-32mm lens does not disappear into the body of the camera like that on the LX7 or RX100 so it's not as slim but it's pretty tiny!I did sell my GX1, but only because I also have a DSLR.  I think the GM1 is a perfect walk around camera for someone who has a DSLR and doesn't want to compromise on Image Quality.If I was to recommend a single camera for a consumer who only wanted one however, it would be the GX1.  The image quality is stellar and IMO the GX7 is too large, though I admit I have not held one.With all the external controls and the removable viewfinder the GX1 is a lot more camera!  Especially at the current price!I will probably end up buying another one.But really the beauty of this camera is it's size, and I've resigned myself to using my D800e (sob) for planned outings.I kept the awesome Panasonic 14-45mm zoom lens (not the 14-42mm or the Power Zoom) and tried it on the GM1.  It works great!  It only overlaps the body by a few mm.  It is pretty long, but it felt fine, not out of balance and I love the ergonomics of the lens, with the full zoom ring and an (admittedly small) actual focus ring!Focus Peaking works with the 14-45 but on Manual Focus, only the focus ring works to adjust focus.  I have the Control Dial set to \"Focus\" when in Manual Focus and it reverted to changing the Magnification of the \"Focus Box\" when used with the 14-45mm lens.If this camera had the external controls and better ISO control of my GX1 and was this same size well... bring on the GM7!In fact I am withholding one star because I feel that Panasonic could add the extra controls and hotshoe we want and save us some of the menu diving.  I feel like they are holding out for the next iteration or two, but I'm not waiting!  They've got my money!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera that needs a bright lens to really shine", "Author": "Sydney", "ReviewID": "R1Z9VK3ME1H1OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am at best an advanced amateur so please discount this review accordingly. I was in the market for a top-of-the-line point-and-shoot camera that's easy to carry around. I'm not demanding \"fit in jean pocket\" portability but for it to not suffer the same fate as my Nikon DSLR (that monstrosity gathered dust for 5 years after I bought it and played with it for a week) it would have to fit into my jacket pocket or my wife's purse. After doing a fair bit of research online it seemed the no-brainer choice was the Sony RX100M2. I went to my neighborhood camera store to check out the Sony, and the fairly knowledgeable salesman suggested I take a look at the GM1 as well. After a bit more research I ended up buying GM1 but not without some hesitation. Over the next few days I shot several hundred pictures under a variety of conditions. Overall I was impressed with the quality of pictures the GM1 took with the kit lens. Where the camera struggled was under dim lights with moving objects. Unfortunately this describes conditions for roughly half the time I take pictures -- indoors and after hours. In these conditions, at an aperture of f/3.5 (the widest for the kit lens) the auto settings in the GM1 defaulted to high ISOs (around 3200) and a shutter speed of 1/30 to 1/60 second. While these settings are fine for static objects, under dim light this is not fast enough to capture life in motion. I was able to get slightly better images by selecting higher shutter speeds (or higher ISO) but the compromise to reduce motion blur was accept greater noise. This compromise is unacceptable to me and needed to get resolved if I was to actually use the camera. My limited knowledge of photography suggested I needed a brighter lens and/or a camera with a bigger sensor. I debated for a while whether I needed to upgrade to a camera with a larger sensor (I went back to the store and played with the Sony NEX-7 with the larger APS-C sensor) but ultimately decided to try a brighter lens on the GM1. I bought the Olympus M. Zuiko 45mm f/1.8 from Amazon, and what an incredible difference that made! Photographs of moving objects in low light have been absolutely breathtaking. I have beautiful pictures of my wife and pets in the dim lights of our living room -- with clarity down to individual hair strands -- with beautiful bokehs of Christmas tree lights in the background. I ended up using the GM1 with the 45mm lens so much that I soon ran into limitations of that lens (it's 90mm equivalent so the angle of view is not particularly wide). So next I ended up buying a Panasonic Lumix 20mm f/1.7ii. It was a slippery slope as I ended up spending as much on these two lenses as the original camera, but I'm very pleased with the equipment I now have, I expect it will serve me for years, and I'm enjoying taking pictures and sharing them again. Both the prime lenses are excellent (reviews on Amazon are accurate) and I suggest those looking at a GM1 consider buying at least one of these to truly harness what this camera can do in low light.A quick wrap-up anecdote for those also looking at RX100M2, and please take this with a grain of salt because this is coming from a neophyte with limited experience with the Sony. A couple of weeks after buying the GM1 I went out and bought the Sony RX100M2 as a gift. Part of the reason I bought the Sony was because the recepient wanted something really portable, and part of the reason was I was curious to play with the Sony. The Sony takes amazing pictures under bright light -- at least as good as the GM1 -- but in low light with moving subjects it struggles even more than the GM1 with the kit lens. The Sony's auto settings under dim lights default to low ISO (under 800) and shutter speeds are far too slow to capture even gentle motion without blur (1/30 second typically). Pushing the ISO higher pushes the shutter speed up and reduces blur, but again the noise is significant. Like the GM1 it was either accept motion blur (or tell your subjects to stop moving -- hardly pratical) or accept significant noise. Comparing the Sony to the GM1 with the kit lens side-by-side for dim light and moving objects, both performed poorly under these conditions but the GM1 did a bit better. But with the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens on the GM1 and the aperture wide open it was no contest under these conditions -- it blew the Sony's pictures out of the water. I ended up exchanging the RX100M2 for another GM1.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The GM1 May Be the Perfect Pockectable MFT Camera", "Author": "Garrett Lowenthal", "ReviewID": "R127CQH06LJCJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little gem really packs a punch.  I am an advanced amateur photographer and by no means a professional who earns his or her living by taking pictures.  However, I own a fair amount of cameras that range from pro-quality DSLRs to cheap point-and-shoots.I personally bought this camera as an alternative to my big and bulky D800 for casual shooting.  I was looking for my first MILC that I can take easily anywhere that offers significantly better IQ than a smartphone or typical P&S.;For both outdoor and indoor photos, the GM1 produces amazing IQ for a Four Thirds sensor.  Plus the camera is so tiny that it is one of the truly pocketable, nearly full-featured MFT cameras out there.  The GM1 is noticeably smaller and lighter than its big brother GX7.  In addition to the bundled kit lens (12-32mm f3.5-5.6 OIS), I purchased the faster Panasonic 20mm f1.7 II pancake lens for lowlight situations.KEY FEATURES-16 MP Live MOS sensor, measuring 17.3 X 13.0 mm (same as GX7)-Electronic shutter, up to 1/16,000 sec; Mechanical shutter, up to 1/500 sec-Fast AF for CDAF standards (AF-S, AF-C, AF-F), with tracking and face detection-Burst rate up to 5 fps in AF-S (mechanical shutter) or up to 40 fps (electronic shutter)-ISO 200-25,600 (Extendable to 125); Auto ISO-3.0\" 1.0 million dot touchscreen LCD-Focus peaking for precise manual focusing-WiFi (IEEE 802.11b/g/n) for uploading and capturing photos via smartphone-Dual-axis virtual horizon-Built-in flash (tiltable for bounce-flash)-Movie recording with AVCHD in 1080i60/30 or 1080p/24; built-in stereo speakersEXTERIOR-Dimensions (without lens) similar to RX100 II, S120-Top: Mode dial, power switch with function button, focus mode switch Side: Mini HDMI, AV out Back: Movie Record, Playback, 4-way thumb wheel (including White Balance and Exposure Compensation)IMAGE QUALITYUnder good lighting and even dim conditions, the GM1 with kit lens was capable of producing images with excellent IQ and good dynamic range.  The colors were punchy and accurate.  AWB was nearly dead-on.  Low light performance was usable up to ISO 1600 before chroma noise started to creep in.Reviewing my images, I noticed that the GM1 seemed to frequently overexpose by 1/3 stop which I accounted for with exposure compensation.SHOOTING EXPERIENCEI found shooting with the GM1 to be a pleasurable experience overall.  Everywhere I went, I took it along with me effortlessly tucked inside my jacket pocket or cargo pants pocket.  The GM1 should have no problem fitting into a purse either.  With the kit lens attached and retracted, the camera cannot be stored comfortably in a typical jeans pocket.  Therefore, a camera like the S120 and possibly the RX100 II is more suitable in that regard.The touchscreen was responsive and bright enough under most shooting conditions.  However, harsh mid-day sunlight still washed out the screen to make it a challenge for accurate framing.  An EVF would have come in handy.AF was fast and accurate under most conditions. Shot to shot time was adequate.I am able to use the built-in WiFi to upload photos from the camera quickly to my smartphone.  This feature works after downloading the free Panasonic Image App for either iOS or Android.The small size of the GM1 is a mixed blessing.  As such, it lacks an EVF and hot shoe.  Due to the small battery, the battery life is exceedingly short.  Panasonic claims a generous battery life of up to 230 shots but I found myself being able to achieve 175 shots and change.  The tiny kit lens is ideally suited for the GM1 but my 20mm f1.7 II is larger in diameter, causing the camera to tilt slightly backwards when placed on a flat surface.  I can imagine that even larger MFT lenses will dwarf the GM1 and provide tricky ergonomics.  Without a grip, one hand shooting is suboptimal.  I found myself using the pincer grasp of both hands most of the time.  The GM1 does have an accessory grip which I did not buy but may help. Also, the flash sync speed of the GM1 is only 1/50 sec, potentially limiting the ability to stop fast action in low light.MOVIE MODEI have not had too much time to test thoroughly this feature yet but the video quality is fine for my needs.  The GM1 has 1080i60/30 and 1080p/24 in AVCHD.  There are no inputs for an external microphone or headphone.  The GM1 has built-in stereo microphones near the lens mount.QUIBBLES-No body cap or rear lens cap included-Screen is fingerprint magnet-Screen fixed and not tilt-swivel type-Kit lens does not have MF ringSTRENGTHS-Outstanding IQ for Four Thirds Sensor-Fast, reliable AF in most situations-Responsive touchscreen LCD-Small form factor, fits easily in jacket pocket or purse-Silent shooting with electronic shutter-WiFi for uploading and capturing photos via smartphone-Dual-axis virtual horizon-Focus peaking for accurate manual focusingLIMITATIONS-Very short battery life-Flash sync only 1/50 sec-No EVF-No hot shoe for external flash-Suboptimal ergonomics for larger lensesCONCLUSIONFor me, the GM1 serves its purpose as an upgrade from a smartphone or typical point-and-shoot, but also as an alternative to a DSLR for travel, street, or casual shooting.  The GM1 is a camera I can highly recommend.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera.", "Author": "C.

I will relate  what my eyes see with the images and videos it produces with the kit lens.  For stills, detail, clarity, and color are excellent.  The white balance seems very accurate.  I have taken quite a few photos, and I rarely have a blurred picture (excellent image stabilization in the lens).  That includes taking photos of children and pets.  I took outdoor Christmas decorations at night.  Using the Auto, Handheld Night , and P modes, I found all of them to work fine.  None came out blurry.Even though the camera uses 1080i instead of 1080p, I see very nice color and smoothness in the video.  The camera has maintained focus for me through the whole video.  I had children staying in focus the whole time while walking toward me and away from me.There is no panorama mode on the GM1.  This is no big concern for me since I take just a few of these on a trip.  (I always take at least two cameras on a big trip, and the long-zoom camera has the panorama mode.)  In spite of the lack of panorama mode, the GM1 has many useful features - time lapse, multiple exposure, stop motion, many filters and effects.  The effects can also be modified (color, intensity, etc.)I have to fiddle with the camera to get a decent bokeh - either by zooming or widening the aperture.  This is more than likely not the fault of the camera.  A lens change is probably all that is needed.  After all, it is an interchangeable lens camera.I own other high-end cameras, including the Sony RX100 II, but I seem to pick up the GM1 more frequently than all of the others.

Not that I will mount a speedlight on it, but I wish I could mount a small radio flash trigger for off camera lighting.2.  wish the battery life was a bit better.  So, I'd recommend getting a second battery.

If your using flash a lot should you buy it, probably not. Is it expensive, yes and no. When I bought it I thought it was way overpriced but after using it for a few thousand shots I'm happy with what I payed. Also remember your paying for the technology that allows the GM1 to be so small, which doesn't really come through in the photos, but does come through in the size and the amount of features packed into this little thing.It has its problems, yes, sync speed being one of them, but I knew that before I bought it and for a bit of fill flash, it is fine.

But what it offers is something that not many others (if any) does: an uncompromised image quality at a diminutive size, with all the benefits that that implies, such as having the camera with you at all times without even noticing it, as it fits any small handbag or big pocket.Having the ability to carry it wherever you go to get such a good image quality for most purposes far outweighs the sacrifices made to achieve this level of portability, in my opinion.You can read my whole review full of images here: gonzalobroto.blogspot.com/search/label/Review", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Revolutionary: The most exiting new camera in a long time", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "RPSR3C5WMD8EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cameta Camera sells a kit version of this product on Amazon for the same price as the camera only.  The product link is as follows.  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1 Micro Four Thirds Digital Camera with 12-32mm Lens with 32GB Card + Case + Tripod + 3 Filters + Kit.  None of this extra stuff is top notch but it all works.  Some of it is useful.While I was first shooting and playing with this camera, I really liked it but I was stuck in my paradigm of it needs a grip, an EVF, and external controls to be a serious camera.  I was wrong!  In fact I bought this camera with the idea I was most likely going to return it.This camera is freaking amazing and so much fun to use.  It is the most exciting and revolutionary camera to come out in a long time.  That is a bold statement with the release of the Olympus E-M1, Nikon Df, and Sony A7.  Well I have all of those camera on hand and have shot all of them.  My favorite to shoot and carry hands down is this GM1!  The others are great cameras in their own right but this camera shifts the paradigm of what a small large sensor DSLM is.  It does this by an amazingly refreshing clean and non-cluttered physical interface.  It marries that with the slickest touch screen system I have seen to produce the least intimidating and best handling camera I have ever used.  That is saying a lot because I have used some amazing handling cameras.  The revolution of this camera is that there has never been a camera this small, that handled this well, has such great image quality, and, drum roll please, is stupid grin inducing fun to use.It is also a dead silent camera.  There is actually no need for the stealth mode this camera has because it is silent to begin with.  If you turn off all the default beeps and squeaks on this camera it is silent.No other camera that I know of has a 1/16,000 shutter speed.  This one does and for using fast 1.4 lenses in bright sun this can't be beat.Another super cool feature if you have the Olympus 12mm f/2 or the Olympus 12-40 f/2.8, when you click the focus dial to manual, it automatically turns on magnification and focus peaking.  Click it back to auto and that switches off.  Sweet. In the accompanying video, I am going to show you how to set it up and how simple and fast it is to use.The camera shares it sensor with the GX7 so this camera has the current state of the art when it comes to m43 sensors.  Another thing it shares with the GX7 is that Panasonic USA is only selling the black and silver version.  Right now there will be no black version, no white version, and no orange version.  Boo Panasonic USA.The lens on this camera is a gem and is optically superior than any other kit lens.  This all the more amazing considering how small they made it.  Shrinking the size like that usually entails all sorts of optical problems which need to be digitally corrected.  While it is a very nice all purpose lens, no one is going to confuse it with a fast prime.  It would be nice if it were a constant f/3.5 but that would increase the size.  The construction on the outside, however, is plastic so you need to be careful not to scratch it.  Right now the only way to get this lens is with this camera.  I am sure that will change in time.My first reaction to this camera is that it does not have a grip.  If this had an EVF that might be a problem.  However,  this camera is too small and is not designed to be held like a traditional camera.  It is small enough and is designed to be carried by 2 to 4 fingers on the top and bottom.My next reaction was this camera does not have an EVF.  For me an EVF is a must.  A camera would have to be exceptional for me to overlook this.  This camera is.  The handling on this camera is specifically setup to not shoot with an EVF.My third reaction was this camera does not have a traditional control dial to set shutter speed and EV.  Instead it has a rotating dial on the back.  This control setup works exceedingly well.  I would not have believed it before trying it but the Digital fusion (couldn't resist) between physical controls and soft touch screen controls is perfect on this camera.My forth reaction was this is a great looking camera.  Very clean and stylish.This actually leads me to what I think is one of the most underrated features on Panasonic cameras and is on the GM1.  This is intelligent auto plus (iAuto+).  I don't think most people understand what this does for you.  With most intelligent autos, the user is locked out from making any decisions at all.  Very nice if you are new and don't have any idea what you are doing but want to take nice pictures.  (Most DSLRs pop up the flash which actually makes this mode pretty worthless).  With iAuto, the camera scans the scene and the decides whether it is a portrait or landscape or flower etc and then makes numerous setting to the camera to optimize the picture.  It would take a person several minutes to make all of these changes.  That part of iAuto is great.  What is not good is you can't usually change the EV or the aperture setting.  But with iAuto+ you can.  You can set in EV, change the Aperture, and even change the colors.  On the GM1 you press the up arrow on the control wheel to scroll through the options of EV, Defocus control, and Color settings.  This is an incredibly powerful feature and I don't know of any other manufacture that offers it.Another really nice feature this camera has is a function button located on top and 5 virtual fn buttons located on the right side of the touch screen.  This means whatever controls you use most frequently you can program and have instant access to.  For a camera with very minimal physical controls, it handles very well and very quickly.Next is Panasonic's Q (Quick menu system).  You press the bottom left button which brings up the quick menu system on the screen.  This allows you to change any shooting setting that you want.I did not think I would really be able to use the large lenses on this camera.  I was wrong.  This camera is so small and light that you are basically just using the lens.  You support the lens not the camera because it is so small and light.My fifth reaction was Holy Smokes Batman, this camera is amazing and revolutionary.ProsRevolutionaryAmazingly HandingAmazingly Small and Light - you really have to see it to believe itExcellent Kit LensCan use any of the full line of m43 lensesGreat m43 image quality in a small packageNice build feelNice Quick menu touch screen system.Great handlingBuilt in fill flash.ConsCamera is so small it is easy to accidentally set something on the touch screen.No tilting screen", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera -", "Author": "Durt", "ReviewID": "R2N7VC551TGZB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional, but I take very good pictures - so I wanted to step up from snapshot camera to something a little more sophisticated & capable ... especially low light shooting. My snapshot camera is an old Lumix ZS7 which takes fabulous pictures, so upgrading to another Lumix was a good place to start. I'll let the professionals supply the technical details and critiques, but as an enthusiast all I can say is this little camera is astonishing. I haven't been able to put it down since I bought it a couple of months ago. The sharpness, the depth, the accuracy just takes my breath away. It MAKES me want to take more pictures. The only downside, if you can call it that, is that I've emptied my bank account to buy a couple of high end lenses - a 25mm, 1.4 Leica for very low light situations (amazing) and an M.

No other system can compete with MFT in terms of the range of bodies in size. From DSLR like bodies in the GH/EM line, to range finder style cameras like the GX7, and now the tiny GM1 no other system lets your lens investment carry over.So what is the GM1 not good for? Photo posers who want to impress people with their gear or that think that a camera must feel \"solid\" and be heavy. Make no mistake with the GM1 nobody will take you seriously. Which makes it perfect for street photography or anywhere people would chase you away with a \"professional camera.\"Hope this camera brings more people to the MFT system and in particular leads people to discover the phenomenal lenses that exist for this system.

That is BS.  Not only is a full frame sensor inherently better than a m 4/3 but L series glass is better than most of the offerings for M 4/3.  I own just about everything Canon makes including 1DX, 5D3, and the big, pro glass, 400 2.8, 300 2.8, etc.  I'm hear to tell you that M4/3 doesn't compare.  Blow your shots up to 100% and look at the difference.  A big difference.  Having said that, this is a $700 camera/lens combo.  Not a $7000 body with a $2500 lens.  For the price this is an excellent performer.  Both camera and lens.  I have the GH3 as well, and this is an equivalently solid performer.  It feels solid, is tiny, and is fun to use.  It also has a great intervalometer feature (like the GH3) which is the main reason I bought it.  While not as good as a \"pro\" camera, in the right hands I think this camera can provide what I would consider sellable pro-quality images.  Let's just say that on a scale of 1-10 if the Canon 1DX with the Canon 24-70 2.8 lens is a 10, this is about a 7.  Still quite usable.

No matter what the specs say it isn't until you live with them that you find out if they work for you. I agonized for two weeks before buying the Sony RX1 earlier this year, and it is without question my favourite camera right now. I have found it easy to carry around and have used it more than any other camera since I bought it. I love the RX 100M II just as I have loved the original RX 100 from the day it came out. The DMC-GM1KS is a different story. I had hoped and anticipated that it would become my new favourite. I followed its progress on UPS as it made its way to our house. But after two days I am returning it (the first camera I have ever returned). Based on the specs I thought it would be my perfect camera. I own many micro 4/3 lenses and I am completely sold on the system's convenience, quality and versatility without bulk. I mostly take photographs of friends and pets, often indoors and in low light. I knew the kit lens would not work well for this because it is so slow, but I figured I owned several fixed lenses with faster apertures. The problem is that with any lens attached to it, the DMC-GM1KS simply is not as portable as the RX 100, and the quality benefit of the larger sensor does not make up for that added bulk. With the Lumix 20mm F1.7 pancake the profile of the camera is much larger than the Sony's, and if one is not achieving true pocketability, then the advantages of a larger form (like the GX7)  with controls that do not rely on a touchscreen outweigh the convenience of the smaller body. So the DMC-GM1KS falls through the cracks for me. In low light, with its kit lens, it is inferior to the RX 100. And if one affixes a larger lens to it, one might as well go out with the GX 7. If my primary focus was on outdoor street photography I would feel differently, because the kit lens would then be fine. I have still given the camera three stars because it does take outstanding photographs.

My 70-200 2.8 USML is a fantastic lens but it's huge (not to mention HEAVY) and therefore intimidating - not ideal for candid shots.Enter the Lumix DMC-GM1, it produces very good images, is customizable, light and TINY.

I just purchased the Lumix 14mm f2.5 prime and have been pleasantly surprised by the image quality it delivers.At under $400 the images are very crisp and the lens is very POCKETABLE.Though it's a fixed focal length I'd say it's a step up from the 12-32mm f3.5-5.6 kit lens which came with the camera. What is lost in zooming is gained in aperture.This camera and the impending Lumix GH4 are making me take a closer look at M4/3 as a viable replacement for my cumbersome full frame DSLR and heavy glass.How great to be able to use the same lenses on both a semi-pro level DSLR AND a pocket shooter.Well done Panasonic!", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!
