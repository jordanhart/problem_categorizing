The descriptions all said that the camera was waterproof, so I thought that I would be able to mount the camera as is, right out of the box. What I didn't know is that there is a cable that exits the camera that goes to a small box, and that box plugs into the electrical mains. That small box is NOT waterproof. So to mount it outside, you will either need to drill your wall and mount the box inside, or buy an outdoor electrical box that can contain the power interface box to keep it dry.Setup and performance of the camera are terrific! Color video during the day, and black and white video under self contained infrared lights in the dark. Video (and stills) can be stored on a micro SD card onboard the camera, on your PC, or on network  area storage (NAS). Setup software is included on a CD and worked flawlessly.Great value overall. I can see adding more of these cameras in the future.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Y-cam", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R2Q72E9OWPBS2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product works great.

I didn't look up the dimensions online, and was unconsciously expecting something the size of the original isight. The bullet is nearly 3\" in diameter, and about 8\" long before you add the antenna and cable.It ships with a sturdy wall mount and decent wall anchors. The awkward part is the camera has a huge proprietary cable that connects to a 2.5\"x2.5\"x.5\" box, which is where the power and/or ethernet cable connects. So now I have a large camera trailing a thick cable to this weird little adapter box that I have to mount high on the ceiling. I confess, it looks pretty wretched in our lobby. But since the police refuse to do anything about the 6'2 guy that keeps breaking in and stealing all of our packages from our lobby, we needed a camera.The wireless range is acceptable. The Y-cam works reasonably well with macs; I can easily view video and configure it from my laptop (this doesn't work nearly so well with the foscam camera I also got). I've set up the camera to record video constantly to a NAS from one stream, and set up the motion detection to record 10-second clips from the secondary stream. This way I have a time stamp for all motion, and can use that to go through and identify segments that we want to review the complete footage for. (The motion detection consistently has a long delay, so people moving quickly through the lobby can trigger a mostly empty video clip; this is why the constant video stream is so important.)If you are recording sound, know that using the AMR codec can result in choppy video freezes on the order of seconds. The AAC codec seems to result in a better product.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "the Best !!", "Author": "F.

I give it 5 stars, then deduct 2 stars for the initial hassle, lack of information, only being able to use Internet Explorer to use the various options, & no audio out speaker as suggested,  But being the only product that puts so many things together, it got 1 star added back, thus 4 stars.  I looked at so many cameras & reviews & despite the Y-cam being difficult, I am glad I figured out its quirks, I hope though I am done tweaking it & it does not become a source of continual attention need.I am using it on a PC & wireless.  Please note, the 'outdoor' camera does not seem like it is meant to be outdoor- it is closely connected to a box with all the ports that is NOT made for outdoors, you would need to purchase something special to house the box.  This IS Wireless for the video/audio feed.  But, power is still needed, sadly there is no battery option.1- The box does NOT have an instruction manual.  Must find online & the manual is not always clear when it is taking about the bullet Y-cam compared to the other Y-cams.2-  What you receive (the box description & what is inside) does NOT list what contents you should have in your box.  The instruction manual also is not helpful here.  The first Y-cam I got seemed like parts were missing, but of course I could not verify- so I returned to Amazon for a replacement, glad I did, cause based off the replacement there were items missing from the first one I received.  Side note to compliment Amazon, I had a no hassle exchange all via their online system, it was great, I asked for a replacement while I returned the first, hardly a loss in time, thanks Amazon.3- The camera does NOT come with an out speaker in it.  It has a speaker so you can hear things with the video.  But if you want to talk to someone by the camera, you will need to buy a speaker separate & connect it to the 'audio out' port that is in the camera's separate box.  Keep in mind power needs again.  Also remember once you have it set up, you can only use this function via Internet Explorer, then you will have the option to push the button to send your audio so the person at the camera can hear you.4- I highly recommend before you start buy a MICRO SD chip 8gb ($10ish).  The instruction manual does not tell you (their online support help does) that you will ONLY be able to view live if you do not have a Micro SD card installed.  You CAN'T get email, computer record, FTP send UNLESS you have a Micro SD card- it records to the card first, then sends)  I did not format it like the instruction manual said to, currently no issues.  Take off the hood cover (if you got the 'outdoor' version)  & spin off the cap/front there is a tiny metal thing NOT labeled, that is where the chip goes, metal side facing the re-set button (the very very tiny black plastic thing next to it.5- If you want to use that *easy* fancy button to record to your computer something you notice while watching the live feed on your computer.  You can only do this in Internet Explorer (which is unfortunate they ONLY offer via IE) & if you are using Windows 7 (& same issue with others) it WON'T work at all unless you right click on IE on your computer & select ' Run as Administrator'6- The set-up is *easy* once you figure out its pickiness.... as long as your version of Widows (I am using it on a PC) & version of Internet Explorer (IE) happen to be just the right combo.  Otherwise, you'll need to do fancy dances to make certain things like how the picture displays- work right.  And the thing is, you won't ever know what is a system oddity & instruction/direction issues.  I did not find until after I went through all the set-up they have this Y-cam HIVE thing, so maybe I could have hired someone to do it all that was experienced with the Y-cam bullet & its picky issues.7- When on their Support website their search bar is Not helpful, it finds nothing.  But, if you start to type an email to them, it will suggest articles that may related- each time I did this, my answer was there!8- I found some people who had issues with the email send if they were not on yahoo or gmail email.  Here is a link from Y-cam's support website about email set-up:http://support.y-cam.com/kb/index.php?action=article&id;=317&relid;=59- Finally, I found this information from Y-cam's support website very helpful, below is the link & it's information.========http://support.y-cam.com/kb/index.php?action=article&id;=127&relid;=7How long can you record on an 8gb microSD card?

Bicknell", "ReviewID": "R3L5L480O3I7SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased a number of Y-Cams for work and for home, and have generally been pleased with them.  The occupy a price/performance spot that few competitors can match, there are plenty of cheaper, and much lower quality \"consumer\" cameras, and plenty of much more expensive and better \"professional\" cameras.  Y-Cam offers one of the few \"presumer\" options in the space.I've used the WiFi for testing camera placement, and it works ok.  WiFi doesn't work well for large amounts of streaming video.  If you want the camera to record locally to the SD card and will only access it occasionally WiFi will be fine.  If you're going to use software to record the camera 24x7 I think WiFi is a world of hurt, and should be avoided.One of the things I look for in the prosumer space is a camera powered over 802.3af Power over Ethernet (POE).  What this really means is that you can run one cable to get power and wired network to the camera.  It adds a little cost in both the camera and a PoE switch (or injectors), but makes installation lightyears easier.  This camera is a mixed bag in that department, there is a 2' lead to a small box.  The camera and lead are waterproof and outdoor rated, the little box IS NOT.  The intention for an outdoor mount is that a hole is drilled, the lead is fed inside, and the box mounted inside.  This actually works for a LOT of cases.  For instance I've mounted a bunch under the soffit outside where I could get to the attic inside, so a small hole in the soffit allows the box to be mounted inside.  However other mounting locations make that hard, and require a small outdoor rated electrical box to house the \"indoor\" part of the installation.  It's something to be aware of, but far from a deal killer.Personally I put an SD card in all of my Y-Cam's and set to continuously record, and then use SecuritySpy to record them over the wired network to a central console for display and archiving.  Should someone swipe the computer the SD cards in the cameras will have the video, but otherwise I can use the vastly superior software on the computer.The API is nice, if poorly documented.  It's easy to write applications to grab a still or video over HTTP/HTTPS.The built in IR illuminator is above average.  It does glow red, but not in a terribly noticeable way.  It lights up about 30-40 feet away well enough to make out general features on a pitch black night.  This unit has a IR cut filter, which is hard to find in this price point.Basically if you want a 24x7, outdoor real camera that might have enough resolution to make out a face I think this is the cheapest option available.  All of the other consumer cameras I've tried are significantly worse.  However, if you have more money to spend there are lots more professional choices that are in fact better.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ycam doesn't work and was missing the breakout box", "Author": "Paul Wang", "ReviewID": "R3EOIZPKFBJ01B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is ridiculous.

I do not own the trivision one so I cannot speak to its durability. But from all the research I have done it is an identical camera. So I for one am disappointed I didnt buy the cameras from there.I bought two of these. Let me preface by saying I own a MAC. The initial set up took me maybe 15min. The \"initial\" set up is plugging it into your computer and being able to watch it inside your network via WIFI. I was able to set up the motion sensor which I still find to be over-sensitive. But there are plenty of options to get that turned down. I am still tweaking it. I spent the next 6 hours trying to figure out how to watch this remotely outside of my wifi network. (AGAIN I OWN A MAC). MAC does not support plug and play. If it had this would have been a two minute process. It took me the 6 hours to find all the settings within my MAC AIRPORT EXTREME to get this to work with the camera. (The 2nd camera took me 15 minutes). Some of you tech gurus might be able to figure this out faster. (If you need help with yours, I would be happy to assist). I was able to get it working outside my network but then I couldnt get it to record directly to my computer. I am still not sure what I did wrong. I used a 32gig SD card to get it started and that worked great.The actual mounting of the camera took me 20 minutes. It wasnt complicated at all. it was impeccably easy.The day light videos are so clear its awesome. I can read the license plates of vehicles within 20 feet of the camera in my driveway. Faces are easily distinguished and if its not too windy out the audio is quite clear as well.The night vision isn't as clear. The IR light reflects off the persons face if they are too close and too far away they are blurry. So facial recognition at night is near impossible. One of my two cameras is extremely foggy at night. I am in the process of working with their tech support to fix that. The other camera is easy to see from. One of my simple solutions to the blurry face and reflective face problems is to use an Incandescent flood light to light the area and in turn that turns off the IR and goes back to the daylight view and with the flood light on everything is picture perfect again.I really do like this camera and will buy 2 more but the 2nd set will most likely be the cheaper version from alibaba / trivision.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Security Camera", "Author": "B Sandham", "ReviewID": "RPIP373PBX1AA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera.
