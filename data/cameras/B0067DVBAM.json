Please everyone, before eliminating products by the rating, sort by ratings and look at all the bad reviews, people will give 1 stars for thing like USP shipping error, product abuse (like with this product), shipping damage, or even a defective something (which could be rare, unfortunally they had one but how was the service getting it fixed, yeah it sucks to have that happen but don't give a bad review because of that, it happens with everything, even food you buy).  Maybe one day people will get it and stop leaving a bad taste in peoples mouths so they can quit bypassing good products because of false bad reviews (just like this product)!  Sorry for griping, it just aggervates me when this happens.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "WASTE OF MONEY", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "RFQ90Z3R58AC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item was a waste of money and time for me. I bought this camera, had it professionally installed and it worked well for a month. After the first month, it started doing some weird things on the screen.
