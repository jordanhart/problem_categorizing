This camera is loaded with it.  It can be used easily as a \"point and shoot\" camera, or maually by a more experienced photographer.The 30X OPTICAL zoom lens is spectacular.  Sure, it might not be quite up to SLR standards, but the pictures I get while SLR owners are struggling changing lenses make a big difference.  I have been taking photos for decades, and virtually any lens with the name Schneider has always been a good one.Important to me, since I take lots of photos of kids and animals, is the short time between shutter push and the photo being taken.  It adapts well to changing situations.Many cameras have no eyepiece viewer, and in bright sunlight can hardly be used because the viewing screen appears so dim.  Not so with this camera.  Although the direct view could be of better quality and include a diopter admustment, it is so much better than trying to compose a photo in the bright sunlight using an almost invisible viewing screen.I love to do available light photography.  I have never seen a camera with such great low light ability.  Sometimes it is almost as though it had \"night vision.\"  I normally set the camera to the \"No flash\" setting.I think this camera might be a little too technical for first time users unless they are willing to get to know the camera and its capabilities as they go.I read a review of a comparable Canon offering, and they criticized the lens for purple fringing -- NOT a problem with my camera.I still carry a small \"point and shoot\" camera, but when I get serious about taking photos, I lean on this camera.This camera seems to have the ability to do just about anything I want it to, including making HD video.If you take a photo at the wide angle setting (28mm equivalent) and then take one at the highest telephoto setting (840mm equivalent) you will likely be amazed.I recommend this camera highly.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A bargain superzoom", "Author": "Mr. Thomas J. Cimicata", "ReviewID": "R1RKFXSSBSAK3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Low light pics are really amazing with this camera. I took a pic in my family room taken at 8:30 at night in smart mode with no flash and the room lit by only the light coming through the doorway from the kitchen and the TV. While I realize you wouldn't want to take pics of people at the shutter speed selected by smart mode (.3), the pic came out with the room appearing as though it was 2 pm on a sunny day.Some reviews have said you can't save settings when you shut off the camera but that is not completely true. If you shoot in PASM modes it will save your settings in those modes even if you switch modes or shut off the camera. While it may not save settings in \"scenes\" and special features (like shooting fireworks or sunsets) those are preset anyway as soon as you dial to them.I am no photo expert but the menus seem very intuitive and easy to navigate.The main reason I bought this camera is that it gives me a lot of versatility with its zoom and low light capacity. I hate flash photography and I like a lot of sports and outdoor action shots of family and friends.The zoom is 30X optical while in smart mode and another 5x digital zoom when shooting in PASM modes (which allow you to override a host of presets that you can't do (except to shut off the flash) in smart mode. Though you cannot zoom manually, the toggle for the zoom is on a ring surrounding the shutter button and very easy to use without taking your eyes off the subject of your pictures. It responds instantly and does not require you to zoom in and out to get where you want like my old digital camera (Sony Cybershot DSC-S70).Very little lag between pushing the shutter button and the pic being taken imo, especially in low light where you'd expect the camera to think about it for a while before shooting. As for complaints that you have to wait until the preview pic goes away you can easily overcome that by pushing the shutter button half way which clears the screen and allows you to take another pic right away.One other thing. I would never buy a camera without a view finder in addition to the lcd screen and the z990, besides having a very bright 3\" lcd which is excellent, has an EVR (electronic view finder) with all the same info you get on the lcd and which is very useful in bright sun when you cannot see the lcd. If you want to use the EVR instead you just hit a button to the top left of the lcd and the lcd turns off and the EVR on.Though I am no expert at photography I have taken thousands of pics over the years with my trusty Konica Autoreflex TC SLR and my Sony point and shoot. But from what I can see this new Kodak offering beats them by far. I really think I am going to enjoy this camera.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super fun, feature-rich camera - with a few disappointments", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R1K5BEV0T5EQC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little background: I have been using Kodak's high-end EasyShares since 2002. I got the EasyShare Max z990 on April 11, 2011. I have been putting this camera to the test for 18 days.There are a lot of things I love about my z990. But I have had enough disappointments to make me wonder what Kodak was thinking, and to question if this camera is worth its original $300+ price tag.My first z990 was very buggy. It kept becoming unresponsive for several seconds or even freezing up. It helped to reformat the SD card and internal memory and to reset the camera. But I ended up having to get a replacement. My new z990 works much better!Things I love:* Best low-light no-flash pictures I have EVER seen from a digital camera!* Very nice image quality.* 1080p video! ... Good image quality. Acceptable sound quality.* Snap pictures WHILE recording a video! They are lowish quality, but still decent enough for a 4x6 or maybe even a 5x7 print.* Photobooth is so much fun! I just wish you could use the timer to add an extra 10 seconds before it starts snapping. ... The camera does give you a few seconds to get into position, but sometimes I need a little more.* My 8 year old LOVES automatic panorama! ... But it can be a bit sensitive if you sweep at the wrong speed or if your subjects are moving. (like tree tops on a windy day)Annoyances* Automatic panorama does not always capture the whole image. - Sometimes it saves less than half of the image.* You cannot set your favorite film effect to be the default. (I prefer more natural colors, but every time I turn the dial or power off my camera, it resets to oversaturated)* Several vividly colored flowers just won't record right on this camera. Example: I have several rose pictures where you cannot tell where the petals are. It's just a smear of color. Some of my wild flower pictures look solidly colored to the eye, but when I take a picture the edges of the petals are colored perfectly and the centers of the petals are white!* No standard \"menu\" button. ... But they did move a lot of the \"menu\" functionality to \"DISP.\" (display)* Included charger was VERY slow. 7 hours and my batteries were only half- charged.* Continuous capture does not meet my expectations. It was the worst setting about freezing up on my first z990. On the new one, it takes about 24 shots before slowing down.* Ability to shoot nice pictures in low-light conditions makes capturing a silhouette more tricky. I tried several times to catch dark strawberry plants and trees against a dark blue sky. - They came out obviously green and surprisingly detailed!Other comments:* Decent battery life - take well over 100 pictures and a few videos between charges. ... Included batteries are 2100mAH. When I use my 2300mAH energizer nimhs, I get well over 200 pictures plus a few videos!* Batteries do fit a little snug when you try to close the compartment. But not too bad.* Built in HDR processing is a nice feature, but often accuses you of moving the camera if there is too much movement in the scene. Does not handle moving objects (such as a kid riding a bike) as originally advertised. ... Instead of multiple images of the kid showing up, I just get a few ghostly smears.* The icons for different modes and affects are bigger, and more detailed. In some ways I like being able to see a sample of what \"children\" are. But I am not a fan of having to scroll to the next screen to see the rest of the options.Overall I like this camera and will probably keep it. But the color quality is disappointing compared to my z1012.By the way ... Kodak told me there will be NO remote for this camera. They said it was a bug for them to list it on their site. ... You might want to look into that.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak Z990 does everything I want and more", "Author": "Cycleguy", "ReviewID": "R2I30J3DDUJ4ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a superzoom camera. We have four other compact digitals in the family, all Canons. When I researched various super zoom models and compared images, I started to take notice of the clarity of the images and the colors from this Kodak Z990. The more I read about it the more I liked what I heard. It was  sample images is what sold me.Because of an old Chinon CP7m film camera I have, I know of their association with then purchase of Chinon in 1997. Chinon was a pioneer in digital photography and Kodak has endless experience in color so while they are not known for high end cameras any more, they sure have a solid history in the camera business both film and digital. I had no qualms considering a Kodak camera.The Z990 from Amazon arrived fast and worked fine right out of the box. The controls are intuitive presuming you've had some digital camera experience. It came with pre-charged rechargeable batteries and a charger.  The display is huge and bright. One reason we have Canon compact digital camers is they were among the last to offer a viewfinder. I find these very helpful when shooting in bright sunlight when the back screen is difficult or impossible to see. This Kodak Z990 has viewfinder that displays the exact same inforrmation and details as the big screen on back does! There is a single button that switches it back and forth from one to another...a fantastic feature. You also have single button access to start shooting videos, or to change to burst shooting mode, macro focus, and to activate the multiple types of self-timer modes it has.I snapped perhaps 30 photos in full auto mode in the back yard. My intention was to see some shots in the easiest to use mode on the computer screen before I would read the manual and dig into the camera deeper.  I also shot the same images with a Canon SD1100. When I put the test photos on the computer screen (I was using FastStone Image Viewer)and started looking at them, I was thrilled with the results and the comparisons. The little Canon is a flawless compact with very few unusable shots and great color rendition. The Kodak immediately proved to be the same way.  Few wasted shots and great color. We have another neighborhood starting about 90 yards behind us across a creek. I took a number of shots with both cameras at things like their mail boxes, cars license plates, etc. at a distance.  The benefit of the big telephoto lens on the Kodak was immediately obvious as you would expect, BUT what was not expected was the clarity of the images! The image stabilization in the Kodak is great and the focus and clarity of the long shots was fanastic. Straight across the board the Kodak produced superior quality images. I realize I was comparing a sub compact 8MP camera to a super zoom 12MP camera, but the benefit is quite obvious, which is why I bought this one... for those occassions where I want even BETTER pictures.I then dug into the manual and started to come across some of the great features this camera has.Here are a few, some you may have not read on even professional reviews:- To capture a video (720 or 1080) press one button and start shooting. WHILE you are shooting a video, just press the shutter to also capture STILL shots at the same time.  Even if you miss a few shots, you can still campture stills out of the video INSIDE THE CAMERA as you are viewing your video.  The stills are high enough resolution fo yield good quality 4x6 prints.- Remember the old Kodak film lineup? Kodacolor film had great, bright, realistic color. Kodachrome slide film was more saturated color. Ektachrome slide film had even more color saturation? You can select those same color renditions (in addition to B&W; and sepia tone) to shoot with. A great concept and a clever leveraging of the Kodak brands of old.- You can add borders to photos while you are reviewing the photo inside the camera.- For RAW format images, you select which images you want to store in RAW format while you are reviewing them... you don't have to select RAW format before you start shooting. The only thing is RAW cannot be saved from shots done in full auto mode...but the P \"program\" mode sure seems nearly identical to full auto anyway!-  It has and HDR mode on the dial. In this mode the camera takes two photos with different exposure settings and then merges them into ONE image with a superior exposure for you automatically. Brilliant!-  Rather than changing to S (shutter proiority mode) to capture faster moving objects, there is already a SPORT mode on the dial that you can quickly change to for the same purpose.- If you shoot a video but have some un-needed footage ate the beginning or end it is not a problem. You can edit the front end or back end off the video in the camera! There are also stereo microphones for the videos- The SCENE modes not only function well but they are easy to access, just turn the dial to SCN, select your mode, and start shooting. With easy of access I will use them more.- The whole camera feels great in my hands and seems very well built. The on/off switch is nice and hefty and one should be able to operate it even with gloves on. Once on, the indicator light comes on and it is also the light that indicates where your main mode dial is positioned.- The screen on back is bigh and bright and the buttons and arrow switch is easy to use and understand. There is also a roller /button swithc for your thumb that controls things like changing you shutter speed when in P (program) mode.-  If you leave your memory card out and start shooting saving the shots to the internal memory, when you insert the memory card it asks you if you want to transfer all the internal images to the memory card. Very nice. Also, when you modify a photo inside the camera (RAW, cropping) it has, so far, asked if you want to save BOTH the before and after image.CONS -- I shot some photos of a red rose in the back yard and on two of the shots, the sensor seemed to be \"dazzled\" by all the red. With this one flower the shots were oversaturated and the pedals were indistinguishable. I took similar close up shots of other red flowers out back and there was no problem.  NOTE - I bought my daughter a mid-range Nikon compact for her birthday in October. Twenty test shots into it and she felt bad to tell me that so many shots were not in focus. Then we took a picture of our kitchen and the \"biscuit\" appliances looked pure yellow. It REPEATEDLY could not capture those tan colors correctly. Overall the Kodak does fantastic with colors. I only mention the Nikon because it taught me that a more impressive name brand does not guaranty anything.- About 200 shots into practicing with this Kodak Z990, I was shooting some closeups and the zoom button simply stopped responding. I re-thought my settings and looked at everything and there was no reason for it. I then turned the dial to other modes and it worked and then stopped responding again. I shut it off then looked at some of the photos, when I turned it back on it was fine.  My Palm PDA and eReader and laptop and netbook all have reset buttons for when those devices may \"get confused\" as well. It has not re-occurred but hope it doesn't happen very often or I could start missing shots.WOULD I RECOMMEND IT -Yes, I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants the big lens without the SLR hassles. Be careful as this Z990 camera is quite different from the previous Z981 model. I believe it even has a completely different type of image sensor.At $280+, the Kodak Z990 is a spectacular value. I would have gladly paid another $100 or even more for the features, the lens, the very effective image stabilization and the incredible image quality.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is the best camera Kodak has produced in the last 7 years!", "Author": "J. Locker \"pong player 1973\"", "ReviewID": "R3CV60J5ZAAIMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera three weeks ago and have been shooting pictures like crazy! The price is right on the camera and it has some wonderful features and a fantastic lens and image quality. Low light is fantastic and with features like sweeping horizontal and vertical panoramic imaging is a winner. I like how Kodak put in emulations for the old Kodak films like Kodachrome, Tri-max and a lot others.I love the very high resolution 1080p video and for a extra $10 you can get a remote control to control both photo and video shoot and viewing.The 12mp BSI image sensor really comes threw with great pictures. I like how it has a built in micro HDMI port so you can hook it up to your TV and see a slide or or watch the 1080p video.This camera puts other superzoom to shame with its power and cost, i have talked with other people that do not like the images coming off of the other big name camera manufactures. Just because it has a big name does not make it better, remember Kodak was the first to make SLR's so they know how to make a great camera.Try this camera you will love it!!!! I am going to buy my sister one for her birthday, i love it so much!.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far, so good..", "Author": "A. Shepard \"Rural Art Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RJZJ4Q0BLQXWC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(This review will be updated)  I bought the camera bundle at Amazon because the price was so good (229).  The included SD card is the Kodak \"High-speed 100x\" 8gb card, which is a class 6.  It does pretty decent on photos, but on burst, I will probably try and buy a class 10 card.  Also, while 8gb will give you 1,000 photos at fine jpeg compression (and less in RAW), it only affords you about 29 minutes in HD 1080 video.  So, keep these things in mind of your needs and what card you'll want to use.The camera body is plastic, with a strip of smooth non-slip rubber on the grip. Some peopele say it feels cheap, but no more so than their previous incarnations.  I was shocked at how *light* this camera is!  Even with the batteries, the size of this camera seems to justify a much heavier weight, but it isn't!  I call this a plus, with a small minus.  The minus being that the place where you attach a tripod is just plastic; no metal.  That could suck in the long run :(.  I had no issue with the battery door at all, and I have extremely small hands. I like that it has a 2-step process to make sure the battery compartment never accidentally opens.Make sure you format the card before use, and after you do a firmware update.  For some reason, burst mode photos were taking *forever* to process, and it was locking up the camera.  After a format of the card on my computer (as suggested by Kodak help), and reinserting, it was about 30 seconds of processing after burst modes.  Much better.  Again, I'll be looking into a higher class of SDHC card, though. Overall, though, I've never really had much use for it, and it seems rather unimpressive on this camera.  If you're buying to use burst mode ALOT and with large amounts of photos, this is not your camera, and you probably have to find something more expensive.The kit comes with the 4 batteries that comes with the camera, as well as a retail pack of 4 more rechargeable AA's. They're 2100mah, 1.2v.  The suckiness is: they must have been half dead by the time they got here.  Pre-charged my patooty! Initially the camera recognized they had some charge, but quickly showed them in the red.  Both sets.  Sucky.Luckily, the camera comes with a charger, which says it can take 11.5 hours to fully recharge these batteries.  Ugh. I see Sanyo Eneloops are in my future (they're good batteries with a shorter charge time with their included charger).  I will update on performance once the Kodaks are charged.I immediately upgraded the firmware from the 1.01 to kodak's latest: 1.12.  It was a single update, on the Kodak website, and took all of 2 minutes. Super easy.I ran through the functions, and particuarly enjoyed playing with the super macro.. it's so awesome to get tiny, tiny things (my keyboard keys are alot dirtier than I ever realized!  LOL).  Sports mode does not seem overly faster than the smart picture mode, and was a little bit of a dissapoint.  I was hoping for better than my old Kodak, an 812 IS.  The photos are, of course, beautiful, and do seem to pick up the warmer hues well, just like every kodak digital I've owned.  Video seemed smoother than my old one (better frame rate?) but about the same visual quality.The big suprise was low-light situations.  Pictures indoors with crappy lighting look really good!  Even without flash, so long as your subject and your hands are still, it's like mid-day! Good plus, Kodak!  Red eye also seems to be down quite a bit.I will update once I get a chance to test night scenes, and see if the low-light situations are consistently better there than previous generations of kodak cameras.The continuous autofocus has a neat feature where if a person or child moves, it follows them!  Very cool.  Not always correct the first time though, and you can change it.  Picture taking speed is super fast if you half-click the shutter button and get your target in frame first.  Good results, every time that way. Honestly, in most situations, you can just use the \"red camera\" option on the wheel, which is Kodak's Auto.  It does really good in adjusting for light, situations, etc.  It's pretty impressive, and I could see a basic family or around-the-house user never having to leave this option, and getting great photos.  Back-to-back photos aren't too bad either.  They may be a tad bit slower than my older camera, but not enough for me to really say for sure.  Probably the same speed, it's just the review of the photo you just took isn't an option; you must look at it.  You can press the shutter button half way to keep moving tho.HDR will need a tripod.  Seriously.  There is no way you can be still enough with your hands to do this function.  Just the vibrations from my small child running past the heavy table the camera was sitting on was enough for the camera to balk and refuse to take the pic, using HDR on a super macro.I'm really interested in all of the manual features (PASM modes) for future photography learning, but was upset that there was no histogram! WTH! I followed the extended guide instructions.. no histogram showing!  I used the Kodak website's chat help feature, and found out why: it's automatically turned off in the settings under UI.  You have to turn that on before a histogram will show for you.  Hmm... you'd think the manual would tell you that, and save the company some time with people contacting help. Ah well.  At least it's there now.Another con is the lens cap.  No, the lens cap is not bad.  It doesn't pop off randomly like on my 812 (but I wish they'd make one that screws on already!).  But the camera throws a hissy if you turn on the camera while the cap is on, and you cannot review photos or video unless it's off.  So much so, that if you dont act within like a minute, it just turns the camera off. This is probably an energy saving feature in case of accidental bumps.The package did not include a cd of software, and I was kind of wondering why not... until I tested out the usb cord.  As soon as I hook up the camera, it immediately wants me to load the kodak software, which is apparently imbedded into the camera itself!  Which is pretty cool: as long as you have the camera, you have the easyshare software.  However, for those of us who hate that slow software, it is annoying that you cannot see the SD card unless you load the software.  So, the only way to avoid the easyshare software is to take out the sd card (which is sharing space in the battery compartment) and load the pics via card reader.  Not a big deal, but it's an annoyance.Also.. no DC power input anymore; it's all usb.  Supposedly, it has a function to charge batteries using usb, but I don't know for certain.  Regardless, it'd probably take forever to do that via usb anyway.  Stick with rechargeables.Other reviewers mentioned the strap quality and difficulty in attaching to the camera.  The attachment is explained in a picture on the extended manual (online).  It even has it's own section in the index! :)  The strap quality is not professional, but a tad bit better than my old Kodaks had.  Not bad, not great, and it's free.  Fine with me!So, overall..  I say this is a good addition to the Kodak family, but has a few initial quirks, and for those of us who are used to older models, it will take a little more adjustment, with new buttons and a different zoom function.  But overall?  I am already digging it, even with the dissapointing burst mode, and the so-so sports mode.  There are some awesome new toys built in (HDR, ability to light paint at night, super macro, etc).  I can't wait to try it out tomorrow out in the outdoors and get a feel for what it can really do.  Updates to come, and hopefully pictures!!Btw.. Amazon: awesome as usual.  Bought this camera bundle direct from Amazon.com on Cyber Monday, delivered on Wednesday using Standard shipping! Woohoo!*update: dec 01, 2011* -  As I'm taking photos, I'm really annoyed by how yellowy they look, even changing color settings.  However, upon loading to my pc, the colors are just as I see them with my naked eye, so if you notice this too, look at them again on your pc before you consider deleting in camera.  I think the display, during photo review, is showing yellows and reds a little strongly.  Also, after some time trying to get photos of my daughter running around on a sugar high: sports mode is working pretty good!  Sometimes the auto mode doesnt get fast enough to keep up with her, *especially* using zoom. I've also noticed a little sluggishness after taking and deleting alot of photos.  Again, I wonder if a faster card helps.  I do notice, however, that battery power seems directly related to camera performance; it really, really preferrs full batteries.  So far, it is sucking battery power, but the charger that came with it is a \"dumb charger\", so I dont really know how full my batteries are getting, and I don't dare leave them on a charger overnight not knowing. So, I cannot fault the batteries just yet until I can get a charger that tells me they're fully charged.  I played around with the HDR and macro functions last night, and got some really pretty pics of my christmas tree lights and an ornament.  HDR is tricky, because it balks with any movement.  And HDR+ super macro??  Not worth the fight.  I have only gotten this camera to do it twice out of probably 50+ tries.  I think I can deal tho ;)  (I uploaded some pics using HDR on my christmas tree lights)*Dec 4th*  I finally got some outdoor time with the camera, in adverse weather to boot!  I was impressed how I got such beautiful pics of my daughter playing in rain/snow, and you could see her clearly as well as the snow and rain drops!  Very impressed. Some looked as good as pro. I also did some video, and was very happy with that, except at the end of one, the focus went out for no apparent reason.  Admittedly, it was trying to follow a fast toddler zooming all over the yard, with rain and snow, so I could see how autofocus could get confused.  I even accidentally took a couple pics during the video, and was suprised at how good they looked.  I would have never figured pics during video would come out nice and clear like that (they're certainly not 12mp, but they could probably get you a good 4x6 print okay).I am a little annoyed at how slow the cameras software runs at times, tho.  I really hope they continue releasing updates until it's as solid as it should be. Sometimes, it gets hung up and I have to change settings to get zoom functions back.  Not a deal killer, but annoying. The lens, the colors, and the photos are still awesome quality, but it does feel like maybe they ran the camera out a little too quickly, and they still have a few quirks to get out of the system.  This will be my 3rd or 4th generation Kodak, tho, and I know from my history with them that they usually do good work with updates and issues, so my 4 stars stand: great camera, but a few annoying quirks with the on board software/processing.I hope to upload more pics later on.*Dec 15th*  Highly impressed by the low-light photo taking ability.  Took photos at an indoor event, and was able to zoom 60ft+, without flash, and got fantastic photos.  I dont believe I used the flash for the entire evening, and every photo came out clear! Software still glitchy at times, but is becoming second nature to work around the blips. Low-light abilities are so good, flash is sometimes detrimental, and creates washed out photos.  Which is fine.. better battery life without it anyway, and no loss in indoor photo quality. Speaking of battery life.. I discovered my batteries are fine. The warning system just jumps the gun.  I took photos and video and whatnots *hours* after the battery symbol went red, and still had battery to spare (one set the whole event, 160+ photos, in camera deletes, and 2 or 3 HD videos).  I have a La Crosse BC-500 charger now, and it works much better and much more reliably than the included kodak charger.*dec 19th*  The new class 10 card seems to help.  I took a couple videos, and the processing time was significantly faster!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing value: good camera", "Author": "Ben Forest", "ReviewID": "R3RE019FHM3209", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used it extensively this summer for vacation, event, talent show, sports (some weakness here) and casual shots. Did two slideshows with video clips using a Mac. Bought this camera mainly after reading the Photography Blog review. I had outgrown my point and shoot and really wanted a SLR class digital camera but that was not in the budget this year. The camera worked well and all these conditions.What I liked: it's low light performance was especially notable, I did attach monopod to steady the camera during a talent show, used the live performance mode; stills and video clips in the low light were surprisingly good for such a low cost unit. Also I was pleased with the flash shots, many look surprising natural. Unlike some of the reviews; I had good results with the panorama feature. It took a little practice to figure out but now it's a snap (I think the firmware update helped). It's well made, took a fall but work fine afterwards. The image quality is excellent, I toned it down to 6 MP for most of my shooting. Of course the 30X zoom to wide-angle lens is amazing; the built-in camera steadying helped when zoomed out but keep a tripod handy.The batteries last long enough but keep an extra set on hand. Bought extra rechargeable to charge. I really like that it uses standard AA, so in a pinch they are easy to buy. Note that he standard disposable batteries do not last long as the rechargeable.Areas for improvement: The computer/digital processing of images can easily bog down the camera. For example; if your shooting video there will be a delay immediately following.  Three to six second delay before you can start shooting photos. Also a noticeable delay after using the rapid-shot option in \"sports\" mode feature; I would not recommended extended use of rapid-shot due to delays and I even had to reboot the device a few times. With that in mind; I do get great video and sports (mode) shots, but with some effort. If you need it be ready instantly for a lot of your photography (Sports); you should consider a different camera. Hopefully Kodak will address this in a future firmware update.Overall the camera exceeds my expectations, especially when I consider I paid about $250 from Amazon. Picture quality is top notch. Low light performance is very good; better than the other \"bridge cameras\" I have looked at much higher cost. I have gotten amazing sports action shots with the above mentioned caveats. To understand and make full use of the vast number of features - and use them correctly -  I spent a fair amount of time with both the PDF manual and Kodak website. There are some quirks with the interface and settings, so give your yourself a little time to get accustomed. There is a small printed manual that is helpful but it cover just the basic functions. Have fun.Tip: download and install the firmware update from Kodak. Lots of improvements. I think that was fixed the Panorama issues some users were having.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ok camera with some deal ending flaws", "Author": "Jennifer Peterson", "ReviewID": "R262UIGCELWFQG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I looked at many digital cameras online and read many reviews before making this purchase (thanks to everyone who takes the time to post - it really helps!).  I purchased this camera because we had a kodak digital camera in the past and really enjoyed it before it broke. It was VERY easy to use (intuitive design and menus), rugged, and accepts many different kinds of batteries (important for us because we live and work in Africa). We decided on this camera partly because of the batteries, but also because we needed an optical viewfinder and many digital cameras have only the backside viewfinder, which is hard to see in bright light situations. The camera is still easy to use and understand, but there is a HUGE delay between the time you press the shutter and when the camera takes the picture. I have missed hundreds of candid photos because of this.  Perhaps someone out there has a solution for this (I will re-read the users guide and see if there is a way out of this)? In the meantime, it makes the camera almost useless for my purposes, and quite a frustrating photographic experience.  Sorry Kodak! I wanted to love it, but it is driving me nuts.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with Small Annoyances", "Author": "T. Fonte", "ReviewID": "R3O8G58ALK53MA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The most important thing for me is the picture quality and here the 990 shines.  Kodak color is more natural than in previous models.  The contrast and sharpness defaults are pretty much on the button, although for me sharpness benefits by going up a notch.  There is plenty of detail; the files seem less compressed than in the past models.  RAW is problematic because of slow writing speed and lack of a good converter.  Adobe Elements defaults are way off, so you have to fiddle a lot to get proper balance.  Kodak's in-camera RAW to jpeg conversion is clumsy as is its Easyshare conversion, plus both strip the exif information.  Irfanview is very good in so many ways (superior RAW image quality to Adobe Elements) but strips exif information in jpeg conversion.  Fortunately the native jpeg from the camera is excellent and there is little reason to use RAW except to fine tune exposure and white balance.Ergonomics could stand fine tuning.  I do not like the horizontal menu overlay when you chose the more information display.  The more information display choice brings up the menu and there is too much information; it leaves little room to see the image.  The old system was superior--no information or limited information under display.  Complete menu was another separate choice.  Another thing I do not like is the inability to turn off the immediate review of a picture.  Slows down the camera and uses battery power.Battery life is very good.  Normal jpeg operation is speedy enough (would be speedier without the instant review).  Control layout and operation are easy and logical, require little learning.  The zoom is awesome (but you do have to steady yourself to avoid blur).  The macro and super macro are excellent, although, again, a steady hand is required to avoid blur.  Low light capabilities are much improved over previous models.  The flash is particularly potent but does not gear down enough in macros, so go back a bit for macros with flash and then crop.The Z990 panorama maker works better than the previous versions on older Kodak cameras.  The scan type panorama maker is a bit tricky to use.  I have used the video function and am very pleased with the visual and sound quality.  I have as yet to try out the HD picture function. I am very pleased with the camera.  For those who might be interested in the camera, I invite you to look at my gallery of Z990 images on pbase (tgaf galleries) to see for yourself if it meets your requirements image-wise.  There is a variety of macro and zoom shots and everything in between.  There are lots of flower shots that show off the color and detail of the camera. I hope you like them.

A bridge camera offers me flexibility without having to use a lot of expensive lenses and other equipment. This one does well for the craft and food photos, not as well for the distances I need for good bird photos.What I love about this camera-Great low light photographs! I don't keep my light box set up and sometimes I just want a quick photo for a project. This camera takes the best photographs I've seen of my crafts in my dimly lit computer room. I don't have to set up lights or use the flash.Fast focus on moving targets- I tested this feature on performers at a fair recently. I was very impressed with how well it captured the motion.Image stabilization- it works very well with this camera even when it's fully zoomed.Size- For all these features, it's a fairly compact camera. My previous bridge camera was a lot bulkier.Fantastic focus for macro photos of crafts, it's my new go-to camera for beadwork and other hobby things.What I dislike about it-Sometimes it doesn't auto-focus well, there seems to be a spot in the 4-5 range if you're trying to zoom in for a good closeup on something you can't get closer to, and if you're trying to focus on something that's a couple hundred feet away, it doesn't do nearly as well as my HS-10.Colors can be a little too saturated which makes an almost illustrated effect on things at a certain distance. This is a plus for some people, but I don't like it.Memory card placement- this is a minor quibble, but still annoying. I keep dropping batteries getting the memory card out. I prefer a separate slot for memory card.In the package, it comes with 4 AA rechargable batteries and the matching value charger for them. It's intuitive and easy to learn how to use it.It does feel more like a point and shoot than a bridge camera because it doesn't operate manually the same way that an SLR or my HS10 does.Recommended for people who don't want to have to learn a lot about photography but still want to take nice photos. It's a great camera for hobbyists who want clear, macro shots of their crafts and hobbies.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak EXITED the camera business but excellent Digital Camera for under $200 Kodak Z990", "Author": "chill", "ReviewID": "R2VFN33C9BJK1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, Fans.KODAK has forgotten us.They have exited the camera business.Probably NO SUPPORT for this camera soon..Eastman Kodak Co. -- which invented the digital camera in 1975 -- is getting out of the digital camera business.The bankrupt printing and imaging company announced today that as part of its efforts to focus on profitable lines of business, it plans by July to get out of the digital camera, pocket video camera and digital picture frame business.While Kodak itself may no longer offer these products, Kodak-brand cameras may continue on the market, as Rochester-based Kodak said it would explore licensing its name to another company offering such gear.\"It's sad to see, but not totally unexpected\" given that growth of photo taking on smartphones competes directly with the point-and-shoot digital camera market in which Kodak played, said Hilton resident Steve Sasson. The now-retired company researcher, along with colleague Gareth Lloyd, received a patent in 1978 for their 1975 invention of the digital camera, which weighed eight pounds and was larger than a shoebox.\"You can't escape the emotional aspects of it, to be sure,\" Sasson said. \"But I'm an engineer and engineers love to change things and we're used to change.\"Kodak for some time has seemingly had a love/hate relationship with digital cameras. While it was one of the planet's largest digital camera companies in the early to mid 2000s, it also was competing in a market with numerous competitors and very slim profit margins -- factors that had Kodak CEO Antonio M. Perez in 2006 famously referring to digital cameras as a \"crappy business.\"And in 2011, the company announced a strategy of focusing only on profitable areas for its digital cameras, meaning it would cut the number of products and the locations they were offered.\"Today's announcement is the logical extension of that process, given our analysis of the industry trends,\" said Pradeep Jotwani, president of Kodak's Consumer business segment.Kodak estimates the move will save $100 million annually.Kodak does not itself make digital cameras, but instead has them manufactured. Company spokesman Christopher Veronda said 400 Kodak employees worldwide -- including roughly 120 in the Rochester area --are dedicated to the digital capture device business, and not all of them will lose their jobs.With digital capture devices out of the picture, Kodak's Consumer segment will include its desktop inkjet printer line, its online Kodak Gallery, its retail store-based photo kiosks and labs, and its camera film and photographic paper business.The company also will continue to offer Kodak-brand camera accessories and batteries.Kodak said it plans to continue to honor product warranties and provide technical support and service on digital cameras, pocket video cameras and digital picture frames.On Jan. 19, the company filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Today's move is the first substantial step Kodak has taken since then indicating its restructuring plans and intentions.Ditching the digital capture business did not require Bankruptcy Court approval, though it was reviewed with the bankruptcy judge and unsecured creditors committee, Veronda said.------This makes me really unhappy.I feel KODAK betrayed itself.------Note: Even though Kodak has declared bankruptcy - This does not mean they are out of business.Kodak took a bridge loan and continues to operate as usual. During Bankruptcy - Kodak willshed expenses and obligations - just like GM did. As you may recall, GM was bankrupt a few years ago.I still feel Kodak did a really decent job in designing this camera and the build quality is really good.Everyone else bashing this camera - they are probably not on the proper firmware level which is V1.12. Or they have bought used cameras that have been dropped and abused.---------This Camera is the best deal around. I know this as I own 3 Cameras and an iPhone (which is a camera too)I bought this Z990 in January 2012 and I just love it.You don't have to know a thing about taking pictures or camera's with this one.You can set the camera to the \"Smart Capture\" mode and hand the camera to your 5 year old..your 5 year old can take a great picture even.Just press the shutter button down 1/2 way, camera beeps and then you press it all the way and you'll get a great picture.As you gain more experience and confidence with this camera, you can get technical with it and adjust all the settings.What is the best - is the high def videos you can shoot.I mean, with this camera - you are a movie producer and director - all in one.All those Discovery Channel videos..If you go out and shoot Hi Def 1080p video with this camera and hold it fairly steady -you'll have footage which rivals what you watch on Discovery Channel.I kid you not.I have been doing this for a week now.As you are shooting videos - you can zoom in and out and the camera will automatically focus - and really focus fast.This camera is crazy good.You can even shoot video through the window of your car even when the car is movingdown the road and it will focus and capture the actionon anything far away - moving or not!Other cars, people, the snow.With this camera with a 30X lens, you are your own reality show producer and your family and friends are the stars.How great is that?I tried this Kodak Z990 head to head with my $700 Nikon D5100 on shooting 1080p video.The Nikon D5100 would not focus nearly as fast as the Kodak Z990.And, the video is in 1080p - the same HI Def that your TV will show on the very best HiDef cable channel.This is really - a movie studio in the palm of your hand.You can capture movies of your toddler, kids at football, anything.And put it up on youtube.Or, you can plug a mini HDMI cable into the side of the camera and plug the other side of the HDMIcable into your Hi Def TV.Then set the camera to play the movie - and guess what?  Home movies right on your TV.In Hi Def too.Don't believe me? Want proof?You can watch my videos I took with this camera here:search youtube for the user moviestudiolandThese are the demo videos I took with this camera on youtube under the username moviestudiolandThey are crystal clear. I took dome of these standing on the side walk and some of themthrough the windshield of the car - while moving/driving even.-----Why you would want this camera:o  Kodak Z990 is less than $200.o  Kodak Z990 - You can just turn it on to the RED Camera ICON - point and shoot. A great picture will come out.o  Kodak Z990 has high end features and quality of an SLR semi professional camera - yet anyone can use it.o  Kodak Z990 is self guided to use - via menus.o  Kodak Z990 can print to a Kodak Hero printer - without involving a computero  Kodak Z990 Can use a 32 GB SD Class 10 memory card and hold THOUSANDS of pictures.o  Kodak Z990 Can hold maybe few hours of home movies in 1080p HighDef TV format with IF a 32GB SD Memory card  is purchased and installed.o  Kodak Z990 You can transfer home movies directly from the camera to play on SOME NEWER TV's via the SD card which holds  the pictures and movies the camera has taken.o  The camera can - ALL BY ITSELF - Play a really professional slide show directly to your HDTV - via an HDMI cable.o  You can switch quickly from taking pictures to reviewing what you have taken with the PLAY button on the back of the  camera.To see how I arrived at the above statements, then you'll have to read the rest of the review.. :-)-----I purchased a Kodak Z990 after reading many of the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.I also wanted to own the best DIGITAL camera that Kodak made.I liked the look of this camera as it looks a lot like my trusted Nikon SLR's.And, I liked the 30x zoom. Best of all - the PRICE. Less than $200.This camera can make you into a movie professional. The 1080p movies are really nice which the camera can take.The Kodak Z990 has exceeded my expectations for a camera under $200 and that has most of the features as an SLR.My Camera experience: (I am by no means a professional photographer)I have owned and still own a Nikon D70S for 4 years which a friend gave me as I did some work for him.I just began to own a Nikon D5100 a month ago which retails for $700 or so.I was able to get the Nikon D5100 on very good terms. So cost was not an issue.I also own an iPhone 4S which takes photos and can record 720p video and takes decent photographs.I really wanted to see what Kodak would come up with and I wanted to buy something designed by Kodak - an iconic American Company based out of Rochester, NY.Initial Impressions:The Kodak Z990 came in a nice Amazon cardboard box. Inside was a nicely done Kodak box with the camera.I opened the Kodak box and had it flipped the wrong way. So, the contents went onto the floor. The camera is in it's own area and did not come out. I collected the contents and found that to remove the camera without wrecking the box - take the Kodak box apart by opening the end of the box with the flaps.Note: I never read the Kodak manual or the internet on HOW to use this camera or anything. I just started to try to use it.o I found the Kodak Charger to be well built.o I found 4 Kodak rechargeable batteries.Put the Kodak batteries into the camera straight away - without charging them. The charge on the batteries was probably 1/3 left.Exploring the Camera:I ran the camera from 9pm to 12:30am just exploring features.I took a bunch of pictures in the house.Then the batteries ran down. So, I put the Kodak batteries into the Kodak charger.Green lights come on to indicate charging. I am betting the Kodak charger is a slower trickle type of charger. In the morning, the batteries were warm - this indicates that the batteries are charged. The green lights were still on. So, you don't know if your batteries are charged. Just see if they feel warm. Warm means done. I did not initially put in an SD memory card, I just used the memory in the camera.On the Nikon chargers - the light blinks when charging and is steady when finished.The Kodak - charger looks to NOT tell you when the batteries are finished... The light stays green.Next morning I put the batteries back into the camera and fully charged as indicated by the camera charging icon whichwent from RED to WHITE.What computers do I own and use for Photos:My laptops owned are: Apple Macbook pro with Lion on it. (takes SD cards). A dell laptop with Windows 7 64 bit.  How do you get the pictures and videos onto your computer: @ For the Mac running LION - I just put the SD card into the Mac Book Pro.  Iphoto came up and imported all the pictures and video into iPhoto. I did not even need to install any  additional software. @ For the Windows 7 (x64) Dell computer - I just put the SD card into the SD slot in the computer.  Windows 7 mounted the card as the E:\\ Drive. I could drag and drop the MP4 videos onto a Youtube uploader  and load the videos up to Youtube that way. I could drag and drop the .mp4 video files to a folder and double click them  Windows Media player opens up and plays the 1080p Hi Def video. Very nice.  ** For the .KDC raw files - you need to put in Kodak Easy Share software if you are shooting photos in RAW.  The Kodak Easy Share software will allow the RAW .KDC files to be retouched and exported as .JPGs.How much of the Manual did I read to learn this camera? (none!)Never read the little manual that comes with the camera. Just explored the options using the camera itself.Very easy to use and powerful features.How to turn on the camera:Turn on the Kodak Z990 with the momentary switch which slides right to left on the top of the camera.If the lens cover is off - the camera will start. If the lens cover is on, the camera will tell you and then it will shutdown and go off. Take off the lens cover and repeat.The rotary function wheel selects the mode of operation - just like a typical Nikon.Take lens cover off. Power up the camera.LED comes on to show you where the rotary wheel is pointing in the dark. Nikon does NOT have that!Screen come on in \"Smart Capture Mode\". The rotary wheel is on the RED camera.What this means- you can probably point at anything and the camera will take a picture of it.What did I try first:The first things I tried are what other reviewers could not get to work:  o HDR  o and the 180 degree PanoramaWhat is HDR? HDR takes a few (3) photos really fast at different exposures and merges them into one good photo.The trick is to hold the camera really STEADY and zoom it out (not in). The camera is looking for similar images to merge. If you move the camera around the images will not match and HDR fails. I was able to take some great HDR images when zoomed out and holding steady.What is Panorama? This is a fantastic feature to take a 180 degree shot. And the camera guides you on how to do it.First: Rotary selector to SCNNext: Press DISP button.now use the square/silver nav button to select the Panorama icon and press the middle button which is called OK in the middle of the nav button.Press the photo take button 1/2 way down to cause a focusThe camera will show 3 brackets - [1][2][3].Start on the left of the room - take one picture. Then note - the right side of the left picture is on the left part of the screen. For the 2nd picture - match the screen of what you are seeing to line up with the greyed out area of the 1st picture. The camera guides you on how to help you stitch the scene together. Take the 2nd picture. Repeat moving to right. Once the 3rd and final picture is taken the camera merges the three pictures into one big picture and saves it to the SD card (if inserted) or standard memory. It is very cool as the processing all happens IN THE CAMERA. This is very good for Realtors to use to take a picture of the inside of a house.---OK let's explore how to use the camera and get around the Navigation.Here are the buttons and controls you see on top of the camera - looking down onto it:On top of the camera:On/off momentary switch - obvious. The camera will turn it self off in about 20 seconds if you  don't use it.The rotary wheel - for major function selection. Has ICONS on it.The silver zoom / un-zoom back and forth selector and \"focus now\" and \"take a picture\" buttonThree little buttons below the power button::  A shooting frames button marked by \"pages\" or \"frames\"  A button with a flower which controls focusing bias - macro - super macro - infinity or manual focus  A timer button - for taking pictures of yourself when you are in front of the camera and have no one to take a picture of you.On the rear of the camera:A nice rotary jogging button (Like Nikon's have). This rotary can be used to glide through the settings menus.* EVF/LCD - Turns off the screen and puts the screen in the \"optical window\"* Silver/Red record button - press to record a video  To the right of the LCD display screen:* DISP - puts extra functionality of what you can navigate to with the square NAV button to display \"on the screen\".* Flash lightening bolt - turns of or on the flash (This is HARD to find on a Nikon)* Magic wand button - Displays effects of what is possible in any mode which the rotary wheel on top is set to* Trash can button - delete a photo in the review photos mode.* Silver play button - go from photo shoot mode to play back pictures or movie mode.* Red Share button - pre assign pictures to be shared or uploaded to Facebook, Orkit, Kodak Gallery and others. You can mark the picture after you take it which is handy.----Making sense of all the features.You don't need to read the manual. Just use the camera!Comment about shooting frames fast: (Both Nikon and the Kodak Z990 have the \"burst frames\" feature)  The  burst frames feature is a very advanced feature. When this is set, you focus and press the shutter button  ONCE. And the camera - all by itself - will fire the shutter 5 times or 9 times in a second.  You might ask - why the heck do I want to do this:  Well, if a race car is crossing the finish line - you can't time it via your eyes and tell your finger in time  to press the button and catch the car. So, you let the camera take a bunch of pictures in rapid succession  all by itself.  Or if your son or daughter is a track star and is crossing the finish line.  Or you are watching a horse race and the lead horse is ahead by a nose. Well, you get the idea.  The camera can attempt to shoot pictures in this professional high speed burst mode.  This is activated by the little button top which is the left most of the three small buttons with picture frames on it.  On firmware 1.10 this does not work very well.  On firmware 1.12 after an upgrade - this works better.When this mode is enabled:The camera will shoot 5 frames or pictures per second (Without flash)orThe camera will attempt 9 frames per second (Without flash).The flash can't keep up as it takes time to charge.I put the camera on this very professional, most intense picture capture mode - RAW in the largest Megapixel (12MP) size.The camera would take 5 or 9 frames or pictures in burst - you can hear the shutter clicking fast. click, click,click, click, clickbut -The movement and transfer of those pictures to the SD card takes many seconds. During that time, nothing else works.You can' change modes with the rotary switch. You can't take more pictures.Hey, if you were trying to catch a race car across the finish line - well, at least you got the shots!The only way you will get a camera to process realtime is to spend $4000 and up. So, this is OK to put up with.Note: Most people will never use this mode.  But, like a turbo in your car engine - this mode comes in handy.When you move the image type to a low res JPEG - you can take pictures in burst and it does not jam the camera for a few seconds at all. You can take all the pictures you want and keep going and going.What slows down burst is the size of the picture. Keep them small and the Camera keep going full speed.My Nikon D5100 gets to 17 RAW photos in Burst Mode and then it also slows down and start to transfer the files to theSD card.So, to get the camera to take pictures fast and have no wait, you need to select smaller picture resolutions - smaller MP sizes.Remember, this is STILL a lot better than an iPhone 4S as far as pictures as you have A HUGE LENS.-----OK, so the main Rotary knob selects the modes of the camera.So, we will turn that knob all the way around 360 degrees and discover what the camera can do:1) Starting at \"RED camera\" ICON on Rotary (Easiest)Turn it on and rotate the top rotary to the RED camera.Press the silver \"take picture button\" 1/2 way down. Beep beep - focused! Press all the way down. Done. Picture taken.If flash was needed, the flash popped up and it flashed.2) Rotary dial to \"HDR\" labelThis is HDR mode. Hold camera very still. Press silver 1/2 way down. Focus. Beep. Then all the way down.Shutter goes about 3 to 5 times. Takes multiple pictures of the same thing and integrates them into the camera. Use in low light to get a bright picture.3) Rotary dial to \"Paint Brush\" ICON - Creative ModesNote the screen in the back. Select one creative mode of:  o Night exposure - tweaks ISO and F stop and shutter speed for night photos  o Dramatic - increases colour  o Intelligent Portrait - Guessing this uses an HDR mode for a face  o Photo booth - This takes 4 timed photos and puts them into a print like from an old school pass port photo booth  o Automatic Panorama - This will attempt to create a left to right panorama automaticallyRotary dial to \"person's face\" ICON - Portrait mode.  Press DISP next to screen to get options to tweak  o Contrast  o Sharpness  o Setup (wrench)Rotary dial to \"person running\" ICON - sport mode  This looks to set the camera up to catch fast moving objects  Press DISP next to the screen to get options to tweak  o Picture quality - RAW, or 3 JPEG modes. Raw is a .KDC file. (The Mac iphoto understands the Kodak RAW)  o Wrench - entry to setupRotary dial to \"SCN\" position - this offers quick setup to scene modes (this is where the guided \"better\" Panorama is )(When you go to SCN - the screen on the basck of the camera shows large ICONS of sample scenes and are labeled:  o Night Landscape  o Day Landscape called Landscape  o Stage  o Fireworks (No not Katy Perry)  o Flower - *macro mode?)  o Guided Panorama (my favorite effect)You select one of the above with the menu wheel or using the arrows and the OK button.Rotary dial to \"M\" label - This is Manual Mode. It works! I really pounded on this mode and it stands up to a Nikon Manual ModeNote: This is the \"camera techie\" or \"gourmet professional\" mode.  The secret to Manual mode - hit DISP near the screen  Then ALL the manual settings are displayed ON top of the screen.USE the silver square arrows and the OK to get around the manual settings.Or - use the rotary selector - black rotary wheel - This is totally well done.  Select a manual mode of:  o f stop (High F stop is let more light into camera. Useful at night. Narrow depth of field. Low F stop - less light.  o Shutter speed - How much TIME the shutter will stay open. Use a short time to capture speeding objects moving very fast.  o Flash compensation - you can boost the output of the flash or you can reduce it.  o ISO - up to 6400 (now you know how an OWL sees at night) ISO means - how much does light affect what the camera  can see. Low ISO - best quality but needs a lot of iight. High ISO - works best at night but picture grainy.  o White Balance - Defines the color of white.  o Color Mode  o Contrast  o Sharpness  o Focus/Exposure Zone - Where in the view does the camera try to get a focus.  o Picture Quality - This means file type. RAW - the camera spits out a ,KDC file. Or, JPEG of low, med, high quality  o Wrench - the Major camera settings.I tried most of these manual settings. They all work.I tried to starve the camera for light by high F stop and fast shutter. It worked. And the flash went up to high charge level and made a super bright flash with a good hearty \"pop\" to try to compensate.Rotary dial to \"S\" - You control Shutter speed  Press DISPYou can change the shutter speed. The camera adjusts the F stop for the best picture  You can change:  o Shutter Speed  o Flash power / compensation  o ISO  o White Balance  o Color Mode  o Contrast  o Sharpness  o Focus/ Exposure Zone  o Picture Quality - file type RAW, JPEG of low, med high.  o Wrench - setup camera settingsRotary dial to \"A\" - F stop. You control the F stop or how much light enters the camera.  This is the same a- but you can only control the F stop or how much light you let into the camera. Thecamera then computes the speed of the shutter. Press DISP for the options to tweakSame as S (but F-stop is allowed here and shutter speed is greyed out)This is Aperture mode on the Nikon and most other cameras. Kodak uses the \"A\" for this as they should. But, clarify it as F-stop on the menu. Well done!  o F-stop  o Flash power / compensation  o ISO  o White Balance  o Color Mode  o Contrast  o Sharpness  o Focus/ Exposure Zone  o Picture Quality - file type RAW, JPEG of low, med high.  o Wrench - setup camera settingsRotary Wheel to \"P\" Program mode.The camera takes care of F-Stop and Shutter speed for you. You can't change these as they are computed for you.Press DISP near the screen and tweak the usual options:\"P\" is the FOOL PROOF mode where as you can tweak a few things - but for the most part, the exposure of the picture willbe correct.Once you learn \"Smart Capture\" well, then the next mode to progress to is \"P\" or Program mode.You can't go wrong in \"P\" mode.you can control all the below (You can't control these in \"Smart Capture\" mode  o Flash power / compensation  o ISO  o White Balance  o Color Mode  o Contrast  o Sharpness  o Focus/ Exposure Zone  o Picture Quality - file type RAW, JPEG of low, med high.  o Wrench - setup camera settingsRotary wheel back to \"RED Camera\" Smart Capture..This is the FAILSAFE where we started this whole round the rotary discussion.You can ALWAYS get a decent picture on Smart Capture.

Incredible flash power output for a small camera.o Takes raw pictures in .KDC format. RAW pictures can be adjusted on Kodak Easy Share software on a PC or Mac  computero Can download photos into an iMac Lion Macbook pro (with out additional software) and iPhoto can import themo Can download into a Mac using Kodak Easy Share software also and in addition to iPhotoo Can download into a PC on Windows 7 using Kodak Easy Share software.o Fast mode switch to record a 1080p video - just press the video record button.o RAW pictures loaded into the Mac book look pretty good. Colors under flash look good.o Failsafe picture taking in the (red Camera) Auto or easy mode.o Lighter than most Nikon SLRo Has a 30x zoom. You can zoom anything and see it.o The batteries are easy to put in as the diagram is aligned with the battery bay exactly.o Seems to focus fast when taking videos.o 1080p Videos uploaded to Youtube are very good and stunning.o macro modes - like super macro works really well. My Nikon D70S can't touch it. I have not tried on the Nikon D5100  yet.o Manual Mode: Manual mode seems to deliver a \"preview picture\" in the LCD viewing screen.  When you dial in the setting you want - and hold down the shutter button 1/2 way and get the beep  and the camera is focused - the LCD screen seems to approximate to the best ability the actual picture you will  probably get. If the F stop is way up and the shutter speed is way up the screen will show a darkened image -  just the same way as the picture will probably turn out.o  The Kodak Z990 formatted a 32GB SD Flash memory card that my Nikon D5100 said was \"unusable\"and needed fixed. That is pretty cool. I put the memory card back into the D5100 and it works great again. (I had copied computer software onto the card to transfer it from computer to computer and that broke the 32GB SD memory card)Conso No optical view finder. The view finder may look like an optical view finder - but it is just a small screen  With the exact same rendition as the large screen. This does not seem too useful.o Plastic shutter and zoom ring. I just don't like important buttons to be plastic.o When the camera is setup to take RAW pictures in a continuous mode - the camera can take up to 12 RAW pictures -  about one a second. After 12 seconds - it will not take any more pictures. And, moving the rotary dial will not  show that the camera is responsive. Postulation: The camera is busy transferring pictures to the SD card and  ignores other requests. This is a quirk and I have seen my Nikon's do this too. This is on the Z990 1.12 firmware  too - as well as the V 1.10 firmware which came with the camera.o The battery door - could snap off if you are rough with it or in a hurry. Looks to jam or bind in a certain  position.o The tripod mount in the bottom is a plastic hole. This was a cost cut. But, ok, the price on the cam is good.o The navigation OUT of a menu - can be tricky. You need to get back to the FIRST item then hit the UP arrow to get  out. This will confuse or trap you. But, it is also an endearing aspect of the camera as I never had to read the  manual to use it.o HDR is fussy. You need to be really really steady to get it to work.Check out the videos produced by the Kodak Z990 on youtubesearch youtube for the name moviestudiolandThis camera is more like an SLR than it is a simple point and shoot.I don't like point and shoot cameras.

I am an amateur so I don't know a lot about manual settings and such. I like to try different picture taking modes, like creative modes > drastic, makes your photo have drastic colors. I like the scene selection settings and the HDR setting. It helps me take awesome pictures without having a photography background. The videos are also great! They take a while to upload to youtube, because they are such a large file, I guess. You can take pictures while you are shooting a video, which is awesome, although the pictures didn't have quite the same quality as when you are just shooting photos. Maybe it is a lower resolution or something, and the pictures are wider....I will have to check into that some more. The only thing so far that made me irritated is that I was taking pictures of baby alligators at very high zoom and the first day I didn't have my tripod, so the drastic mode and the hdr mode kept telling me, picture not taken, need to hold camera still (don't remember exact wording but that is the gist of it). That really irritated me. Also at such high zoom, I found that I had to use the sport setting because any movement from them caused blur. But that is understandable being zoomed in so far. It takes wonderful shots in low light, normally I would have to edit that later, with so so results, being that I am amateur at that as well. All in all, I love it!One other thing, the day after I got it, I went to the bayou to take some pictures at about 8am, when I got home, I saw that the color was not the bright green I was used to. I got on the chat with Kodak, the lady said I had 30 days to send it back for a refund and suggested I try some different settings. I went back out there around noon, and the pictures were of course super green again, like I am used to. It ended up being my \"duh\" moment, not the camera, because until the sun is shining on the bayou, it doesn't appear as green.

I've had the opportunity of trying a few different super-zooms since 2009 and never came across one around $250 with such built & photo quality, features, and feel in your hands. The lens quality, diopter, and diameter are all extraordinary for this price range, 30X optical with built-in stabilization, shooting RAW,  460K high resolution LCD, 1080P HD movies,  C MOS sensor with 6400 ISO low-light sensitivity, HDMI output and more.The competitors in this segment are Nikon P500 & 100, Fuji HS20 & 10, Sony HX100, Panasonic FZ100 and not so much in my opinion, Canon SX30. From the moment you hold the Nikon(s) in your hand you get the feeling of a cheap toy camera, lens diameter is narrow when it protrudes and stabilization is horrible. Fuji HS20 is nice but a bit bulky and heavy and cost around $425. HS 10 is slow in processing photos, its response time is long and LCD screen resolution is 230K dots. FZ100 photo and lens quality are among the best however it has 24X optical zoom, ISO of only 1600 for low light and costs at least $400. Canon SX30 only gives you 720P movies, has 2.7\" LCD screen which only gives you 230K dots resolution, comes with CCD sensor with expected ISO of only 1600, and on top of all it costs you a good $400.That leaves the only camera worthy of its price: Sony HX100v only if you want to spend $450, almost twice as much of Kodak Z990 to get maybe a little bit of extra features such as geo-tagging and industry leading 920k LCD resolution.

Everything seems to be where it should. I already own a Panasonic FZ50 & have come to expect certain shortcomings with small sensors. I was blown away at how little \"noise\" this camera produces(even in low light)! As a matter of fact it seems to get better in low light situations... I'd have to say this camera with its BSI CMOS sensor is better than anything I've tried in the past. The lens is fast & the zoom action is smooth. The 3\" LCD display is gorgeous offering a 460,000 dot display, Great for composing the shot. I don't understand why these \"bridge\" cameras don't have a threaded lens that accepts filters... this camera is no exception. The lens is quite amazing offering a whopping 30X zoom. Where this camera falls short is in the menu layout. Navigation leaves something to be improved on in future models. I found it to be too \"linear\". One example is in \"manual\" setting. Controlling exposure is way to convoluted. For example: let's say you set the exposure to f5.6, go to take the picture & determine the exposure to be either too bright or too dark. You'd think you would be able to get right to the most recent setting... NOPE. It takes you back to the default setting ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE PREVIOUS WINDOW, & you have to navigate back to where you were. I found this to be irritating & frustrating. Another issue is the \"default\" preview of EVERY shot as you take it. You cannot override this. You literally have to wait while the camera shows you the image taken & then proceeds to save to disk. Very irritating! Luckily, if you shoot nature shots or static images like flowers, you'll be able to live with this. Just remember, it takes a few seconds before the camera will allow you to take the next shot. I like the fact they've included a nice charger for the AA rechargeable batteries(also included). The PDF manual is also quite good although you'll have to download it. Overall I would have to give this camera high marks for its build quality  excellent images & full set of features.

Well, right out the box, it seems like a wonderful camera.  All of the different modes and features...the look and feel...the 30X optical zoom, and wow...the 12M pixel rez.So I took it for a whirl.  The Kodachrome was Kodacool.  And sure, I could take a picture of the moon, and some subjects on the beach in wide angle,  BUT THAT WAS IT!!!  I guess it was the excitement which blinded me from seeing the real \"picture\".  As a matter of fact, I was wanting this camera to be everything it was described to be.  After a few weeks of using it, I sent it back.Here's why:1.) Auto-focus: Worthless!  8 out of 10 shots were out of focus.2.) THE PROCESSING SPEED:  The time between shots was torture.  3-5 seconds!!!  Trying to take pictures of children with that kind of lapse between shots... IMPOSSIBLE!!!  You lose that \"Kodak Moment\".  And when I was in burst mode, it took longer than a minute to process the shots and to let me continue shooting.  It would also freeze up and I would end up having to take the batteries out, in order for it to reset.3.) BATTERIES!!!:  This Camera should be Nuclear Powered, the way it ate through the batteries!  Seriously!  And I used several different kinds of batteries.  I have had many cameras throughout my life, and never have I seen 4 AA batteries deplete so quickly.  My old Kodak Advantix, with its wierd flash system couldn't plow through batteries that fast.4.) Resolution:  Maybe because it has new CMOS technology, my pictures sometimes had a strange grainy look.  Almost like it was shooting in 1MP mode, needless to say, my pictures were not 12MP quality.5.) HDR:  NO!  This is not HDR...this is some fancy 3 shot exposure with high contrast...which rarely worked!  On every attempt to use this mode (Or the Creative mode) It would display a message to steady camera (put it on a tripod).....it would display this message...WHEN IT WAS ON A TRIPOD!!!  I even set the 2s and 10s timer while it was on the tripod.  Same error message.Do yourself a favor...don't buy this camera.  It looks hot...but it's not.

As is increasingly common with newer cameras the Easyshare Max uses a backlight on the sensor to flatten noise, and it works well, but nonetheless if you zoom to the actual pixel level noise is visible even in some well lit shots.  The automatic white balance works very well in a variety of lighting conditions.It does a good job with flash on indoor low light shots, but the stunning performance of this camera at full zoom is amazing and well worth the price for that alone.  A family of hawks have been hanging out on a tall tree outside my house, already on top of a hill, using this camera I got shots of them from inside my house through a dirty plate glass window while the hawks were about 150 feet away. Sample photos @ [...]  The image stabilization feature works very well, the lag time between fully pressing the shutter from a pre-focused state is negligible, usually undetectable.While using this camera it may seem it saves to the SDHC card very slowly, but in fact what it does by default is show the last image until a timeout is reached, this was an opportunity for improvement never taken.  Just press the shutter button slightly when you think the last image should have been saved and you will find it already was when the camera immediately reverts to showing you the current view through the lens.I very much like the electronic viewfinder on this camera.  I use it instead of the LCD panel and suspect that has contributed to the battery life being so good, easily over 200 photos.Many of the images from this camera seem quite soft on focus, no doubt in part because of the agressive noise reduction in the firmware, they benefit from sharpening in post production.My camera came from Amazon with an included Kodak NiMH AA charger and a set of 4 Kodak NiMH batteries.**See edit below** I (originally) gave this camera 4 stars, I'm glad I did not let this bargain slip by.EDITED LATERAfter using this camera more I find that there is clearly visible noise even in very bright scenes.

Recently, I was on vacation and it fell and broke.  When I was looking for a new camera, I realized that the one I had was no longer worth $250 so I could either spend less or get a better camera for the same price. Since I hadn't bought a camera for 6 years, I decided to just spend the same amount that I had spent before for a new camera. I ended up buying the Kodak Max \"used\" in \"good\" condition on Amazon.com.I love the different effects that you can make. Sure, you can probably do most of that when you're editing, but it's fun to be able to see it right away. Plus, you can use the effects on the video. The video, by the way, is really nice quality- worlds better than the video quality that I had on my last camera.On the auto setting, you can hold the button down halfway to focus and then push it all the way down to take the picture. This isn't a great option if you're taking pictures of kids- you'll miss the picture that you were trying to take. Luckily, there is a setting for taking pictures of children in good lighting. This setting works fast. If you mess around with the different settings, you'll find that some are faster and don't take as much time as the auto setting. For me, I wanted a fast camera and was even considering spending the major bucks on a DSLR for the fast shutter speed. But, a DSLR is way more than I need- it would be overwhelming. This camera isn't much faster than most on the auto focus but you can get it to be very fast on the manual settings. If you're considering a DSLR but you don't want the cost of one, the Kodak Max is a great alternative if you're willing to learn how to use it.The full user manual is online but it's easy to read and has pictures. If you buy this camera, you really should learn the manual. So many people don't learn how to completely use their camera. If you aren't focusing on the auto setting, you're going to get a horrible picture (so don't just point and click it all the way down like many other cameras).

I was definitely not disappointed!  I love it!  Until now, I had been a point-and-shoot girl, and this is a great camera for you to get if you want to: a) move up from a point-and-shoot camera, b) learn to use manual camera settings without spending a fortune on a dSLR and lenses, and c) still own a camera that lets you take awesome point-and-shoot pictures.  Especially if you are just learning, it can take a while to learn how to adjust the manual settings, and if you're in a \"take a picture - NOW!\" situation, it's nice to be able to still use this camera as a great point-and-shoot.First of all, if you are buying this because you think the $180-ish price tag is a great deal from Amazon's list price of $450, that's not quite right.  This camera retailed for somewhere around the mid-$300s range when it was introduced last year, so the savings on Amazon are good, but not as spectacular as Amazon leads you to believe.  That said, this camera is worth every bit of the $180 I paid for it, and then some.  Also, the lens on this thing is pretty big, so take that into consideration when you are buying a tripod (the lens shifts the center of gravity, and it will tip some tabletop tripods) and a camera bag.  Another thing that is a bit misleading is that the lens looks like it can be rotated to adjust the focus - but the lens on this camera is fixed!  The manual focus is adjustable via button settings ONLY.Now... on to the good news!  This camera captures AMAZING colors.  I found reports of some similar-level cameras doing weird things with bright purples, but this is not an issue with this camera.  The only thing that might suggest a problem with color levels is that I think the LCD screen tends to show colors on the images as overly bright, but when you download images to a computer and view them or print them, they look fine.The 30X optical zoom is incredible.  I call it my \"stalker lens\" - I like to take pictures of outdoorsy things, and a zoom lens is invaluable when you are trying to sneak up on wildlife.  The resolution on the digital zoom is also high enough that if you have to utilize the digital zoom in addition to the optical zoom, the image quality is still pretty good.  I submitted a couple of photos to the gallery above - a brown anole (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo13YTLHFYK9UEY/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link) and a redbellied turtle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo30K4ISUUR2FXH/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link).  The colors are great and the images are sharp, even though I took both of them in \"program\" mode and only adjusted the focus.  The camera does a great job of compensating for lack of knowledge on the photographer's part!The macro mode and super macro mode are terrific.  I photograph small needlework items up close to show details, and I am actually a little cautious with macro mode because it shows EVERYTHING - not only my beautiful embroidery, but also lint and cat hair.  I posted an example to the image library (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1XJIQWWKTMCHA/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link).The camera uses rechargeable AA batteries, which are nice because they are relatively inexpensive, but it would be nice to be able to plug in and charge the camera.  The battery life on the included batteries is good, though - about 100 pictures' worth.The HD video is surprisingly good, too.  I used this to take video at a high school graduation, and the camera did a good job of recognizing where the focus should be.  The videos are crisp and look great, and the sound is pretty good.Overall, I am not a real photographer, but if you are looking to hone your skills and learn more about photography, this is a great intermediate camera for you, especially at this price point.

Powerful zoom, powerful image stabilization that goes along with it and allows you to easily snap 30x shots freehand (albeit more blurry than wide angle shots but that's inevitable), fully auto and fully manual exposure, focus, and aperture, loads and loads and loads of features that you'd normally expect on a DSLR. Image quality is great (there is some very fine grain, however, but it has that \"actual photo\" feel to it rather than the square JPEG-y stuff or color noise common with digital cams), and with all the features you can get great shots in any situation. I've been able to resolve individual cells on flower petals in super macro, take super-zoom shots of details you'd need a telescope to see, and take nighttime photos that look like daylight. In short, you can definitely push the limits with this camera.Of course, everything comes at a cost, and here the main cost is speed (and battery life, but more on that later). It's certainly not the best camera for capturing extremely spontaneous/unexpected moments, but 98% of the time this has not been an issue for me. Actually my camera does something odd and I don't know if this is a common problem, but it gets progressively slower the more full the card is (reaching downright unbearable levels on a full card). I don't know why this happens, or if it can be fixed with a faster card. Frequent image dumping to the computer keeps this issue to a minimum for me. Anyhow, on an empty card I find the camera's speed perfectly acceptable. Keep in mind you can press the shutter button to get right back to shooting after taking a pic.As for layout design, it works pretty well for the most part. I love the quick access to options by using the slider wheel. The one thing I have a gripe with is that you cannot access focus modes directly but have to cycle through them. This wouldn't be so bad were it not for the fact that every time you pass \"super macro\" you have to wait for the lens to reach its preset zoom level, and then wait again for it to go back to the previous zoom once you leave that mode. This can make going from macro all the way back to auto a bit of a pain. I am very puzzled as to why the focus wasn't placed as one on the scroll wheel options.Now as for the batteries. Yeah, it's a fairly big camera with serious features; don't expect it to run on mist. I'm very confused about people's comments bashing the choice of AA batteries versus bulit-in, however. Lithium ion isn't gonna get you that much farther per charge than NiMH will, but if you are out somewhere where there is no electricity and you run out of juice in that one battery, you are *DONE*. On the other hand, you can carry an arbitrarily large arsenal of AA batteries with you, reload, and keep shooting. If you're into the whole hiking and nature photography thing, you most definitely do not want an irreplaceable battery. I also didn't notice it chewing through a set THAT quickly; I guess it depends on flash use, which I almost never do.If you're a shutterbug who just wants a camera that you can whip out and snap shots and put away, which works with no fussing or any effort to understand its functioning, this camera is probably not for you. If, on the other hand, you are serious about taking good pictures but don't want a serious price tag, this is definitely the best or one of the best cameras for you. If you are the type who can handle technology with a few small quirks rather than flipping out at them, if you don't mind taking the time to understand how everything works, this camera will be a formidable tool in your hands.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera to bridge the gap between DSLR and a regular point and shoot", "Author": "cBlu3", "ReviewID": "RDS8GYKVA1RTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Good:This camera is EXCEPTIONAL at taking nice long distance telephoto shots AS WELL as beautiful wide angle macro shots, the camera is able to focus with an object pretty much touching the lens and is also able to capture great detail. The camera does a great job at automatically adjusting white balance. The panoramic picture mode (The one that stitches 3 pictures together, not the one where you pan the camera) works wonderfully, i was actually pretty amazed by how well its able to stick photos together. The pop up flash does a great job and the camera does a great job balancing the colors for it.The Bad:Battery life is horrible. The rechargeable batteries that come with the camera will last for maybe 100 pictures when shooting RAWThe Camera is RIDICULOUSLY slow when shooting RAW which will definitely cause you to miss pictures in a fast paced environment. (it is however fairly quick shooting in other formats)Theres definitely a noise issue shooting at night, long night time exposures produce a noticeable amount of noise even at the lowest ISO setting. Not the best choice for night time photographyThe menu system definitely takes a minute to learn, especially if you're already used to the menu systems on popular DSLR cameras.(After i learned it though, it was a sinch / fast to navigate)Theres no manual or custom white balance, this is incredibly frustrating when the camera just cant seem to get it right on its ownThe longest exposure setting is only 16 seconds, i personally would have loved to see this at 30 seconds.All in all, its a fantastic little camera for the price, and is able to take beautiful pictures up close and far away, would definitely buy again.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "New to Me-update 5/7/11", "Author": "Tina S.

When taking pictures of close up of flowers and even using the top button for flower/macro , it would not unless i was back farther and used zoom. sometimes i did get 1 picture in before it would quit and fog out. All this even while it showed the flower symbol still active. thinking i was blocking the light or something else. Tried to do birds , same thing, today it would be there but when i tried to take the picture it would refocus on the woods in the background. finally i went into scenes, switched to flower/macro there and was able to take the birds at the feeders outside the window while i was inside with no problem using the zoom. even back sitting in the chair. will post a photo when i get time to upload it.I pre ordered this camera through Kodak. received it a few weeks ago. I have taken many pictures but only 2 videos. I really like the quality of the pictures. I have owned a film slr camera for many years and went digital a few years ago with a small point and shoot that took floppies. and then bought a kodak easyshare point and shoot which i still use both cameras. i like both. the Kodak i take on trips - it does have video but the t/w on it was very jerky for pictures or video. and when i pre ordered the kodak max i was worried about this feature. it is okay. I just felt that the video did not the 2 times i tried it stay in focus or follow in focus what i was taping. the smaller kodak camera did a better job. i did accidently take pictures while i was video taping. i had been trying to stop it like i would the other kodak camera. those pictures were great. very sharp. i kept one- of the TV taped program even. the pictures i have taken are great. they are very good and when the camera came we were haveing those storms go through up here. high winds. i was able to get it to lock on with the partial press then full press for the picture take. i did have to lean against something or the camera would fog out like my computer would in windows 7 and not take the picture.  but when it did , they were good. the camera is fussier then i am used to. I have looked through the other settings and tried some of them. I was expecting more out of the dramactic color setting .and unless i print out the photobooth or panorama pictures- i probably won't use those two.  i am still waiting to try the video out on the horses in action to see how it handles. my review is more on the pictures then the video. i don't feel i took enough video to understand this camera yet.  i have been told when i bought my film slr and read as well - many years ago- that it takes alot of film to get just a few good or great shots and too not give up especially if you are serious. and the good thing about digital is that the pictures are right there and can see and edit right away.  i did not get many pictures out of the batteries and it does take a long time to charge. i did buy an extra set 2300 that are in now.  i am still figuring out the settings and plan on trying them all out soon. i do like the burst setting. For birds and horses. i have not had much luck with low light pictures, like i mentioned ealier, it would fog out like my computer and not take any pictures. i still have to try the manual setting and iso or exposure compensation like i have done with the other kodak. mostly i have used auto on program or smart capture. with a few burst and up close flower mode.  Sorry if this does not help and great if this does. i like the fact that i do not have to deal with changing lenses and still have great zoom. not so caring on the wide angle. living on a farm alot of times we take photos of the calves and it is hard to get close to some of them.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare Z990, a great product", "Author": "Ronald D.

I had read the reviews and, for the money, it was a best buy.  First, I have never used a camera with a 30X lens and I was awed at the clarity of pictures shot at a distance. My first picture was of a postal worker making deliveries.  From 80 feet away, I could read the small details imprinted on the back of her baseball cap. Greater distances, particularly those shot at night, will require a tripod. Still, the resolution from the lens was remarkable.I am an old school photographer who bemoans the loss of Kodachrome film. I was pleasantly surprised that Kodak included Kodachrome and Ektachrome settings in the camera, providing the vivid color that we, film photographers, used to expect from our media.I like the heft of the new camera body.  I am a big guy and the size of the Z990 felt comfortable in my hands, reminiscent of the pre-digital, old 35mm days.Some reviewers mentioned that the rechargable batteries did not hang in very long during shooting. First, the camera has a 3.0 inch LCD and if you keep that active during shooting, it eats up energy (a common event for all large LCDs). As a film photographer, I used to carry multiple cans of self-rolled film when going out on shoots. As a habit, I carry multiple sets of charged batteries. Still, you can use the electronic view finder instead of the LCD to cut down on energy use. This also is useful on very bright days when the LCD gets blanked out by direct sunlight.Some of the processing time is slower than expected, particularly for video. But the added feature of being able to snap a still shot while recording video makes this a multi-tasking machine.  Welcome to the 21st century!The Z990 is a replacement for my Z712 and it is a wonderful surprise to find that, despite all of the technical improvements, the quality of the end result has not diminished but, rather, been improved to approach that of the more pricey DSLRs.

I have used this camera at both a concert and a play (Wizard of Oz) and using the STAGE function (no flash), was able to capture some really great pictures.  Am looking forward to visiting the zoo this weekend and getting \"up close and personal\" with the animals by using the 30x Optical Zoom lens and then running off to Dollywood to capture the beautiful Christmas lights and Christmas parade in Gatlinburg.  I especially like the ease of use and the special \"FUN\" feature of a four-pose snapshot (like you used to get in those little photo booths along the boardwalk or at Woolworth stores many years ago).  This camera also comes with a view finder (most of the cheaper models only come with the digital LCD screen unless you pay mega-bucks for an SLR-type of digital camera with changeable lenses at $650 - $1000).  I find that using the view finder helps steady the camera and you get much less camera shake (although it is equipped with stabilization).  This camera uses rechargeable AA batteries (or alkaline batteries in a pinch), so it makes the camera a bit heavy for those wanting a thin-wallet size camera, but the 30x zoom and special features are a plus if you're at a concert, zoo, play, or outside sporting event - including NASCAR racing. It also takes video (which I have only used once) and the results were great. Two things that are not furnished are a \"paper\" instruction manual (you have to download it off the internet) and a memory card.  Be sure to purchase at least a 16x SDHC card to enable you to take plenty of video.  A 32x would be even better.  Again, this is a great camera for the price.  So for less than about $260 - $280 total cost (adding in the purchase of an extra set of AA rechargeable batteries, 16X SDHC memory card or better - and maybe a camera case if you don't already have one) you get a camera that takes great photos (even at long distances).

Kodak offered to let me pay to have it repaired. As it turned out, the camera was bulky to carry, often froze, and sometimes refused to focus. Waste of money, waste of time.This is my third EasyShare camera and my second in the Z series. I waited out a couple of generations of Z cameras due to the reviews of the versions after Z612. I used my Z612 even after its flash was broken and it wouldn't sync via USB... I liked it that much.Overall I am delighted with this camera. I had wanted something smaller, so I purchased and then a week later returned a Panasonic ZS10. I liked the size, but the indoor image quality was hugely disappointing, the viewfinder was dim, the menus were clumsy, and the outdoor pictures were ok but not amazing. I decided that I would continue with a larger camera in order to have a point-and-shoot with excellent zoom and indoor picture quality.The Max is what I have been waiting for. The electronic viewfinder is clear and bright (and it's very easy to toggle to the other viewfinder if conditions require). The big-a** zoom is awesome--I have a close-up of the Golden Gate Bridge, miles from where I live. The colors have that brilliant Kodak \"pop\" I have come to expect. I also like how Kodak figured out that the buttons need to be intuitive to casual users. (Have you ever handed a Z612 to someone and then had to point out where the shutter release is?) The indoor picture quality is exemplary (as is the outdoor picture quality). The preset scenes are useful. It looks sharp. Even little things, like the included neck band, are nice touches.If I could fix anything, I would reduce its footprint by at least 10% (it's just large enough that my small hands have a little trouble grasping it), make it easy to recharge batteries internally, provide an option for turning off automatic picture preview (I know I can depress the shutter release, but I'd just like to turn it off completely), and find a more compact battery (the batteries are currently consuming a lot of its space and weight). But after my experience with the Panasonic, I'm willing to compromise--especially for the price, which is quite reasonable for the features (did I mention image stabilization? I am lefthanded and have to press shutter releases with my slower hand).Kodak is a very undervalued digital-camera company... the quality of the EasyShare line is one of the world's best-kept secrets.

Got my Z990 couple of weeks back and have been totally in awe of its performance. I had a few Canon point/shoots before and  wanted to take this one before i 'graduated' to a DSLR. But after spending over 1000 snaps with this Z990 i dont think i want to go for a DSLR for the next 3-4 years. Will wait for the mirrorless revolution in DSLRs to go evolve further.  This is a wonderful camera and dont think you need to go for a DSLR unless you are serious professional photographer (meaning someone who makes real $ from his pics).You can do pretty much everything with this camera that you want to do with a DSLR without the hassle of lugging a large bag and the array of lenses. My friends have DSLRs (T1 and T4i) but they are amazed at the versatility of this compact package!! Just sharing a few highlights of my experience with this camera:- Great zoom. Yes the zoom was always its plus. however, the optics used make it even more wonderful to capture pictures in its full clarity and use the effects. Good IS but a tripod would make it easier to snap, as with any super zooms.- Color look amazingly natural. I never got this kind of natural colors from my earlier digicams- Lots of options to practice your creative photography. The modes are easy to use and easy to access and they actually WORK!- One of the reviews mentioned that the custom settings are not saved if you change the mode. e.g. exposure settings in program mode. However, it was not true in my case. The custom settings were the same even when i toggled between modes.- The zoom in macro mode is absolutely amazing and you can take really crisp close up shots for objects around 10 feet away and get perfect background fading effect. This is a really versatile feature and you can also use it for some realy close up portrait snaps without actually shoving the camera in subjects face!- Greats presets which are actually tuned to perfection. Like the night landscape mode. Took a snap well past midnight of landscape and these came with dusk kinda light- One of the reviews mentioned they were not able to take snaps with background light and get the silhotte effect as the objects in front came out with details....but i could easily get it in program mode without much of change in settings..except for reducing the exposure.- Great non-flash photography: Though it has a really awesome flash, but this camera gives give superb performance in low light.- Multiple focus options lets you focus on the areas you want to choose and fade the others.. almost a DSLR feature. Along with HDR and RAW capture this comes as close to a DSLR except for the sensor size.- Commendable performance in burst mode thanks to the fast backlit CMOS sensor.- Great full HD videos: Though the focusing while taking videos can be a lil slow, but it does an amazing job for 90% of the time considering its not a full blown camcorder. Snapping while recording video is a really smart option :) lets capture the still images as well while recording the video.Some of the things which could have been improved on this great camera:- They could have put in a bigger processor as the one in the cam right now lets you know its being pushed to the limits very often- Recording speeds are better than what i expected but could be bettered further (though class 10 SD HC may give better results than my class 6 SD HC)- Manual focus would have boosted its ability for really creative snappingOverall i am really really happy with this camera and the bundle i got. (8 rechargeable batteries+ charger + hdmi cable + 8gb class 6 SD HC Card). For this price i would say it one of the best deal and great bargain......and definetly not a CHEAP camera!!Go for it and be the snapper you always wanted to be :)Update: I have uploaded a few snaps which showcase the cameras capability. you can check them out.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera when operated within it's limitations", "Author": "Thomas M.

The next cameras I was considering was the Fuji film 25exr, 30exr, Canon SX40 HS, but this camera was half the price of the others.The reviews that I read are fairly correct.  The battery door is thin and wiggles when opened and the battery door is fairly hard to close, but not rocket science, just patience.Time on till first picture is rather fast, a half second at most.  Time between photos is kinda weird.  If you press and release the button at the right speed the camera will take several photos in a row, no focusing, but if the camera needs to focus, it takes a rather long time, since long is subjective, 1.5 seconds to 4 seconds.  Which is an eternity when you see the picture you wanted fade away.Picture quality:  On auto taking a picture of a purple, pink and white flower with a grass back ground, the camera did wonderful.  I was about 2 inches away and then zoomed a little with my computer.  Wonderful detail.Camera Speed:  I have a nice canon DSLR, and this camera is no where near that speed, but the camera is 10% of the price.  Make sure you get a fast SD card.  Read the reviews and check the speed.  Class 10 is the best, trySanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21) you will not be disappointed.  They do cost a little more, but what is that picture worth?Batteries:  I have read that the batteries could be a problem.  The fully charged rechargable batteries were nearly drained, I charged them using my quick charger (you will need a quick charger and another set or two of batteries), the batteries quickly died after very little use, I recharged them again to no avail and used a brand I purchased on Amazon Tenergy Centura AA Low Self-Discharge (LSD) NiMH Rechargeable Batteries, 1 Card 4xAA and they seem to be working fine.Would I recommend this to a friend?  Well, it depends on what the friend is going to do with the camera.  If you are going to need the camera to take action shots, like sports or Christmas time where things happen fast with the kids, than this is not the camera for you, the Nikon P150 or the Canon SX40 HS is a better choice.  If you want to take pictures that are static or near static like a flower, people posing, birds singing; the stuff in Highway Magazine, than this is the camera.Conclusion:  Dollar for dollar, you will be hard pressed to find a better camera, but if you want to spend at least twice the amount and the dollars mean nothing to you, than get the Canon SX40 or better yet the Nikon P150.  The photo quality of the Z990 is very good within the limits of the camera.  Remember you are purchasing a sub 200 dollar DSLR bridge camera.I chose this camera as an alternative to the expensive, heavy DSLR camera.  There are place I hike and such and do not want to risk a thousand plus dollar camera.

I also tested the automatic settings. The lighting (outside, near dusk) was crappy. But it performed very well.I used some color printouts from our corporate printer (for printer calibration). I took pictures of the color palettes using different settings. depending on the settings the colors do shift a little bit. But not enough to be objectionable. However, if you go out and take pics looking for perfect, you will want to familiarize yourself with how to use the settings. if you're a baby about that, get a point and click. It's pretty good camera when you know what settings you might need to make a better picture. Which is probably the difference between an amateur and a novice.You can just set it to Automatic or HDR mode, maybe change a setting, and do just fine but may have the occasional so so pic. That's not the camera's fault, it's the photographers. What I didn't try- macro/supermacro, video.You will need a class 10 sdhc card. Your memory needs to be fast if you want it to take fast pics. The screen only has to display whatever is going on. Rendering it, letting the camera do its fancy processing, will take time and if your memory card is a dinky pos then it's going to make the camera seem sssslllllooooooww[...] Pay extra for a fast card. If it's still too slow, change the MP setting.I also searched flickr for camera shots from the same camera model, and also checked out youtube videos from the same camera model. They all seem to be pretty good samples. Spend a little time getting to know the camera, you will take great pictures. Oh the zoom is awesome. I live by a small lake. I couldn't see the house clearly Across the lake. With the camera I could get their front door in most of the frame. That far away it gets grainy and jumps, a small movement by me obviously makes the subject swing about wildly. So you have to be steady.

I tried similar cameras that were up to twice the price. some performed a little better but I don't think they had the variety of options. If you want to spend double, might as well spend even more and get a dslr. But for the price, I'm happy.Update: I've taken it to a few clubs. Sometimes the flash does not automatically pop-up, and you can not do it manually- unless you want a broken flash.  I think that if you open the battery cover for a moment or two, then close it, the flash will pop-up. Not sure why. It's not a bother so far. I think it has to do with the batteries. Fresh new batteries don't seem to have that issue. The battery charger light also does not turn off, despite what the manual says.

But a really cool function is where, after you shoot a shot, you can use the telephoto lever to greatly magnify any particular grid of the photo in the LCD to make sure everything is in perfect focus. This eliminates the possibility of you finding out after you get home that some of your shots were out of focus, but they looked o.k. on the LCD. Also, this camera has a manual focus feature that really comes in handy when you have a wide depth of field shot. In certain modes a slider appears on the screen, and you can adjust the distance of the closest object you want in focus to infinity. Not only that, but while you're adjusting, the LCD magnifies so you can better see when things are in focus. Also, any landscape/scenic photographer will tell you they prefer to shoot on bright, overcast days, usually with a polarizing filter to get away fro m harsh shadows and highlights. This camera has a shooting mode called \"HDR\", which takes three shots in rapid succession, each with a different exposure, one normal, one to correctly expose shadows, and one to correctly expose bright areas, then \"combines \" them together, to create a photo in which all areas of the photo are correctly exposed, essentially making a \"sunny day\" shot look like it was shot on a bright overcast day. NEAT! Then, to take care of the polarization effect, you can select a color saturation modes. Not quite the same effect as a polarizer, but neat anyway. The optical stablizer is excellent up to about 100mm, then I suggest a tripod, even in bright lighting. I almost died when they stopped processing Kodachrome back when I had my Nikon 35mm film body. This Kodak camera has an interesting function that emulates the characteristics of the old Kodak film - Ektachrome, Kodachrome, even Tri-X B&W.; Although it does emulate the tint, hue and saturation characteristics of those films, digital can never (maybe never say never?) emulate the contrast and \"etched\" looked that Kodachrome had, although there is a contrast selection in the menu, I haven't noticed any discernible difference using it. Which bring me to my last point. Every digital camera I've used, no matter what price range, creates \"softer, less contrast pictures than the film cameras. I still have to use PhotoShop to correct this problem on every picture I shoot with digitals. Same thing with color saturation. But all in all, if you're looking for a fixed lens, extremely versatile camera, packed to the gills with very practical features for an unheard of low price, this should be a serious consideration for you.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Strong Performing Bridge Camera", "Author": "Scooter", "ReviewID": "REJ0W0F6YOJ7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Kodak camera. Have always been a Canon or Olympus fan for digicams.For traditional cameras, I have always been a Nikon user (N-80). I have never been a loyal Kodak camera user.This Kodak Z990 delivers more than what I expected at a very competitive price (I waited for months waiting for my sweet spot in terms of price). Like most, I spent months researching various options - the finalists were the Fuji S3000 or S4000, Panasonic FZ40 and Nikon L120. These 4 cameras were similar in price and features.Kodak Z990 offered the best price/performance and feature ratio - at a certain price level.If the price was any higher, I might have gone with the Panasonic FZ40.Positives:- Great fast zoom up to 30x optical and AF is pretty quick unlike the Fuji 2950/3200/4000 models.- Zoom is quiet (did not hear it in movie mode)- Videos are very high quality, not grainy/jumpy - my kids were quite surprised at the difference compared to older Canon SD750, SD1000 and Olympus FE series.- EVF is a big bonus, as it saves a lot on battery power- Color options are varied - vivid (Ektachrome), saturated (Kodachrome) or standard (Kodacolor)- I usually shoot with vivid.- B&W; options are very good too - corresponding to familiar shades (TMax, Tri-X, Sepia).- Full control options (Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority or Manual). I usually shoot with Aperture mode.- Wide aperture opening (f2.8 up to f8.0). The Fuji 2950/3300/4000 do not go as wide as 2.8.- BSI CMOS sensor is very good in low light.- Very good quality photos up to ISO 400 or 800. I usually shoot at ISO 200-400.- Relatively fast and responsive (non-continuous AF paired with Class 10 SDHC)- Dedicated video button - allows to take videos quickly- Option to take photos while taking videos (which often means 1920 x 1200 for me).- Video up to 1080p (the Nikon L120 goes up to 720p only)- The HDR mode is a great option (but many other models have this now).- After spending 3 weeks with the camera - I actually LIKE the UI navigation - simple / single level.- Uses regular AA batteries - unlike the Panasonic FZ40.Negatives:- Unable to use filters. Filters are very important as it protects the lense.- Camera errors when lens cap is not removed before unit is turned on.- Battery compartment cover unwieldy to close sometimes- Enclosed strap is low quality - not wide and thick (I guess they cut corners here)- The pre-charged batteries were practically dead when I initially used them. I guess this sat long in inventory. Not a big issue - had to wait overnight to charge them before initial use.- A little bit on the bulky side (due to the battery compartment). This was actually my biggest complaint because the Fuji and Nikon used the same 4 AA batteries but the overall size is smaller. But after 2 days, I have gotten used to the right handle grip.- Wish I could do manual zooming.- Wish it had metal with rubberized body- No miniature mode ... (still researching this).I hope this (camera's electronics) last long ... but it looks nicely built. I did buy a 3 year square trade warranty on this.I want to give it 4.5 stars ... due to the strap and user interface navigation ... but these were minor ...

I guess the release of the Z990 leaves similar cameras made by other manufacturers begging for mercy. I am a professional photographer, meaning I live off photography, so I chose this camera using a lot of professional judgment, taking into consideration everything starting from the camera's ergonomics to the sharpness of the lens, and believe me, look no further, you won't regret it. Its 1080p HD video is superb and the sharpness and quality of the optics at the maximum and minimum focal lengths are just insane, I'll dare to say, even better than most high end cameras out there.

And unfortunately, I am in the midst of a final exams hazard and cannot hop on a plane. However, I decide to try my new Kodak Z990 anyway. The result is astounding! Even though I was standing on the ground, I get the clear moon I got on the plane--only clearer!This camera is undoubtedly one of the best for $200. Its menu system requires some getting used to, since it is displayed on top of the screen in pictorial form, rather than full screen.

Fortunately, I noticed the problem while I installed the strap, so I gripped the camera firmly at all times. I will probably buy a better strap soon.**Update: I just found that, according to wikipedia, Kodak announced that it will \"stop making digital cameras.\" Therefore, sending the camera in for repair may be difficult.

Overall, the best improvement between the z650 and z990, ignoring the MP and optical zoom differences, is the BSI CMOS gives greater resolution in shadows.The Good:Controls are easily operated with thickly gloved hands. Minor sleet does not cause hardware issues with the exposed zoom barrel. Firmware since 1.10 seems to fix the time issues people report. Firmware 1.12 fixed an overlapping text labels error in the UI for me. UI is intuitive if you know how to use a music player directional control with ok in the middle. Jog wheel allows rotation of options within menu option, instead of entering the menu for that option. Fast capture to SDHC time with class 10 32gb.The slightly annoying learning curves:The battery/SD slot compartment cover takes some dexterity to hold the spring lock open while sliding the cover closed. Flower mode turns blacks to olive green in presence of green backgrounds. Best alternative is manual mode with super macro, adjusting shutter speed to take aperture exposure into the camera's range. Just be sure to use a tripod. Night landscape mode overexposes white regions of nearby light in sleeting conditions. Most of the menu options are now in DISP, not MENU.The bad:High motion backgrounds (sleet, snow, crowds) at night cause 1080P video to refocus to the point of blurry video. HDR, long exposure night shot, and anything depending on the picture having no motion, cannot capture when any motion is present, even with a tripod.Update 1 Feb 2012:Super Macro mode with manual mode and a good lighting setup can resolve details down to 1/5 mm.Sports on a clear cold night has few to no shear lines when camera is moved with the players. Have not had a chance to examine the frame by frame. Walking with the video recording induces nauseating amounts of horizontal shear lines. I expected the stereo microphone to do this, but footfalls on crunchy snow can wash out surrounding voices 3 ft away. In terms of filming projector screens, some high speed pixels smeared, but otherwise no qualms in that situation regarding video quality.Update 5 Mar 2012:Managed only 300-400 pics with energizer ultimate lithium AA's. Power manager only drained batteries to just above the 1.5V level, when they could have been drained much further. The numbering system for pictures is DCIM/'folder number'/'picture number', where 'folder number' increments by +1 every 300-400 'picture number'.Update 11 July 2012:Use of a good sturdy shoulder rig eliminates shear lines while walking.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "Honda", "ReviewID": "R2VNVMAHS2KFJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm impressed with this camera.

Took it to Four Corners, NM, AZ, UT, and CO.  Had no problems with an 8Gb class 10 (fast) SD card installed.  It took over 200 photos and several videos on the set of betteries that were included in the box.  For those not in the know, batteries of that capacity can take a number of hours to charge.  With the included charger, about 16.  You MUST have a fast SD card (class 6 or above) for any camera like this to save photos quickly.  I use only class 10 cards and it cycles very quickly.  Yes, it does take standard SD or SDHC cards.I liked the optics and features of this camera so much that I ended up buying yet another one on June 22.  Got them both for a very good price (thanks Kodak and Office Depot!).  I'm sorry Kodak is getting out of the photo business after all of this time.All I can say is that it blows away my Fuji S1800 as far as low-light and taking photos in which the sun is almost in front (but not in the frame).  The Fuji's lens will flare purple in every instance (they were known for good optics, but apparently not with their cheap point and shoot cameras). Similar style to the Fuji, but this one's optics did not flare (at least I couldn't see any).  I didn't point it directly at the sun to see if I could get it to, either.There is one con...the menus are rather non-intuitive.  On my previous Kodak from 2006 (similar design), the menu system was considerably better.  Still not used to this one.  I wanted to set the camera to take infinity shots and it wasn't obvious that the flower button on top would cycle through not only close-up settings, but its infinity focus setting, as well.  Guess I should have spent a little more time with the manual.All in all, if you can find one of these at a good price (I paid somewhat less than $150 each for these), go for it.  I don't think you'll be sorry.As an added note: I've had the camera lock up on me a few times.  Or it appeared to.  Actually, the batteries were low and it just stopped responding.  Make sure you take not only your rechargeable batteries, but take a few sets of ALKALINE BATTERIES along with you, as well.  If the camera sits for an extended period, the rechargeables may be dead, but you can pop a set of alkalines in it quickly...those will sit a long time and not lose a charge just in case you really need to use the camera.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love This Kodak Z990 Camera", "Author": "A.

The zoom is great, but as others say, if you are using maximum zoom, it's best to be using a tripod for a steady shot. Also shot some HD video with it. Very nice and okay audio quality.

I had to call customer service because I couldn't close the battery compartment.  I figured it out by the end of the call - you have to keep pressing down very firmly as you wiggle the compartment back and forth.  What the customer service gentleman said was move it over to the right, then while pressing down - move it back to the left.  However, my husband doesn't have nearly as much trouble with it as I do so we've designated him the battery changer.  Used 4 kirkland brand batteries while charging the original Kodak camera.  I took about 50 pics and three very short videos and those batteries were dead.  Despite the battery compartment and maybe batteries dying a little prematurely - I still love this camera!  The pictures I took with it at the Wild Animal Park were clear and crisp on the smart capture mode (everything automatic).  I'm just a beginner with a camera, so I was very pleased with the results!  I printed about 30 pages of the manual - that is all a beginner will need and I love the borders you can put on the pics and the different kodachrome modes!  The software - I got extremely frustrated while installing it because I did not realize that it would take several hours for the pictures to find their way to facebook - and subsequently thought that feature didn't work.  One thing I did notice is that when you're using the software there is also an email button on the toolbar.  We tried to use this and it kept saying the Kodak server was busy, so I don't know if it was a one-time thing or not.  I have still not figured out how to lower the pixels on a group of photos, we had to do it one by one and place them on the desktop in order to attach to an email so if anyone knows an easier way please tell me.  I do not have that function within my email as far as I can tell.  The camera is the perfect size for a good camera.  Not too big and not too small.  As others have said it has a nice \"heft\" to it.  My husband likes it too.  I had purchased an expensive Sony SLR and returned it the next day because I was just overwhelmed with it.  This is a great little camera for a beginner based on the pricetag.  I also purchased a warranty rated highly on amazon.  I bought this camera for a trip to Italy and now I can't wait.  I spent about 2 or 3 hours with the manual and the camera and I feel fully confident with the burst mode, and the tools.  Need more practice, but I can already tell that the quality of the pictures is going to be great.  I'm so glad I didn't spend the $25 on \"digital cameras for dummies, senior edition\".  Haven't viewed the videos i took yet because i accidently erased them.  I received the camera in the promised 2-day time frame.  Oh, by the way, the other people were right.  The camera strap is horrible.  I will have to buy another one, but even with that and the warranty it will be about 1/4 of what I was planning to spend.UPDATE:  5/29/2012 -  Purchased a CaseLogic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom camera case for this camera and it fits perfectly!

Yes, I really liked the 30x zoom. And with it I took some good pictures at full zoom, in glaring sun on a crowded day at the zoo, without a tripod to steady the camera. Perhaps I'm too spoiled by the way my DSLR operates, and you can't expect this P&S; superzoom to have all the processing horsepower of a much more expensive DSLR. Therefore, I'm not changing my four star rating. But I just couldn't stand how long the camera took to write data to the SD card after I snapped the photos. I tried different brands of Class 10 SD cards, I used \"burst\" shooting modes (and the camera has a choice of them), and I even pulled out my go-to P&S; (Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS-9) to check its data-write speed, because I've not been bugged by that when using the ZS-9. Still, I just didn't like that aspect of using the Z990. So I've returned the camera. I would still recommend it if you can live with that lag, and I'm wondering a little if I'll regret returning it. I probably won't, because what I really would regret, is keeping it and leaving it on the shelf most of the time.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love taking photos when traveling, and have always wanted a longer zoom lens than I have with either my DSLR or a point and shoot. But I just can't see shelling out the price for a camera like the Nikon COOLPIX P500 12.1 CMOS Digital Camera with 36x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom, or the serious bucks for a really long (and heavy!!) zoom lens for my Nikon DSLR. So I was delighted last month when Amazon cut the price on this camera, and I ordered it.I've now taken it out around town for practice, to try it out and get used to its quirks and features before leaving on a vacation later this year. So far, no buyer's remorse at all. I've posted a couple of photos to the \"customer images\" for this camera. I zoomed in at 30x on a lounging lion, wishing I had a tripod for stability, but the photos came out so sharp you can see the lion's whiskers. Not bad for what I paid for this thing.I've also taken family group pictures indoors at night without flash with this camera, and have been very pleased with the results. I like the feel and weight of the Z990. It's a little too big to slip easily into my usual size of purse, but I'm sure the Z990 will go with me on vacations and even around town when I expect to be in picture-snapping mode and am carrying a big enough bag.The big annoyance so far is that it takes too long to write the picture files to the SD card. I'm going to explore this further and hope to find an adjustment or workaround. (And, I have updated the firmware to the latest/current version.) A lesser annoyance, is that I have trouble closing the cover of the battery/SD compartment. It's very hard to position it correctly to get it to snap back into place and lock. Worries me a little, that it might break someday. (Oh well, if it does, there's always duct tape.)I got a wrist strap for the Z990, which I've also used with another camera, and I think it's a good choice: OP/TECH USA 1801021 Cam Strap QD- for Compact Cameras and Binoculars -Neoprene (Black). The camera is light enough to easily carry in one hand, and the strap secures around my wrist for safety. Rather than buy a separate bag for this camera, I got this \"wrap\" which protects the camera while it's being carried in a purse or tote bag, and I'm also pleased with it: Fotodiox Neoprene Zoom Camera Cover Sleeve/Travel Case for Kodak EasyShare Z990 (EasyShare Max), EasyShare Z981, P880,. It's quite snug and sometimes takes a bit of wrangling to get the camera positioned correctly, but I'm pleased with the protection it provides. (I found that the lens cap comes off easily if the camera's in a bag without being secured or wrapped, which would be risky for getting the lens scratched.)", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great CAmera", "Author": "Julie Mclea \"love to shop\"", "ReviewID": "R2NI19XSMHKL4D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had any of the problems others had.

I recommend the 'program' mode with the image quality set at fine, or even better, the RAW file format.One downside to this camera is that as far as I know, you need their Easy Share software to process the RAW format images into another format. I use the TIF format, and then another program to save it to JPEG, where the compression can be set with more precision.

Open Windows movie maker software and select all the files now in the folder that will be used to make the movie. (click on the first file and the last file while olding donw on the shift key.) Once loaded, they will form a timeline on the right side of the screen. select all using the same shift key click technique and go to the edit tab and set the slide time from the default 7 seconds to a more reasonable 3 seconds. While you are at it, go to the Project tab and indicate that the movie format size is 16:9. Now save the project settings to date by creating a project file (.wlpm) in the workng folder. Save the project info ever few minutes- it is like using a word processor- if you get to far ahead, it tends to start crashing, and you have to dedo everything that was not yet saved. The software is well behaved if you do these regular saves.8. Edit the video protions (trim out bad parts) by manually dragging the cursor along the .mp4 you are editing. (the play function requires at least a fast dual core, graphic card, and lots of memory to work well, but the manual drag is great, and gives better control than playing does.9. Drag pix and movie clips to new locations, add titles etc. If you want sound with the jpegs, use the atube catcher mp3 download button to open mp3 dwonloader and type in the name of a song, artist or topic. You will get great stuff to preview and download to the working folder. Save it at 320 bit rate for high sound quallity and set the timeline cursor where you want the music to start and add the music at the \"current point\". Set the cursor on the last frame you want the music for and set audio to fast fade. You can then start a new song at that point by adding at current point.10.Play the slide portions manually to see how the random Ken burns effects look. Most will be fine, but stop the preview and change the type of animation for any pix that seems to have people walking backword or is reading the sign in the window from right to left, etc.11, Under File, Make the movie as an 1080p HD.12. .wmv is not supported by apple, and some of your friends will be using apple, so open atube catcher again and use the video converter tab to select the .wmv as the input and output it to the same filder as .mp4. If you made the .wmv movie 16:9, the frame size will auto correct for different jpg (4:3) and .mp4 (16:9) players, and you won't get lots of fat people and long cars, in the slide parts, and the movies will be great too.12. Now for free distribution to your friends. You tube will let you set up a private video, and Phanfare will cover you for $100 per year, but most cloud services limit file size, and these movies are BIG. I like CX>COm it is easy to sgn up and use the 10 gig free account, and it will keep track of friends in goups and send them a link when you post a new file or folder. Best of all, individual file sizes and types are unlimited, and they have an app to make it easy for friends with ipads, etc to view the files in stunning sharpness. If you have more than one email account, you can open more than one CX.COM ccount, and use each one you different things. (keep that set of girlfreind1 pix away from girlfreind2). The email invitatins they get come from the specific account set up with that email.That is enough to get you making and sharing really good videos.

This camera focuses on single objects very beautifully, and I love the bokeh effect in the background that naturally happens with close-up shots. The only problem I had with this camera was far away shots, like mountain shots/forest shots. It is okay with these shots, but when you actually zoom into your picture that you just took -the trees will be blending together with so much static. This was a problem for me. I couldn't take any pictures of a large group of trees and be satisfied with it. It's HARD to find a camera that does \"it all\" perfectly though -unless you want to spend $9,000 or so. I will always love the macro on this camera. I have gotten so many gorgeous shots of fungi.. You could see the pores and little hairs on them. I'm very serious about the macro. It's gorgeous. Very amazing focused shots. It is great up-close and personal.. not great with far away highly detailed shots of the woods. That's about it though, so don't miss a chance to own this amazing camera!

This camera does everything and anything that a camera of its class can do, supposedly, but it does fall behind in some areas.Features:This camera has all the features you could ever ask for. 12 MP is more than you will ever need, despite the manufacturers trying to trick you into buying more megapixels. The 1080p video is also great and a variety of image modes are available. The lens is also relatively good for a bridge camera, going all the way down to 2.8 aperture. The ISO range is big and the 3\" screen is nice a bright. Also, you get a TON of zoom. Of course, you don't need me to repeat the features list all over again in this review, but what I'm going for is that the camera has a lot of features for it's price.Build quality:Despite being of plastic construction, the camera feels really solid. It's heavy, but not heavy in the way that it makes you not want to carry it anywhere, heavy in the way that it makes you feel like if you dropped it, nothing would happen to it.Image quality:Image quality is great in most situations. At night your images are very grainy, but that is to be expected from a camera with a small sensor size such as this one. During the day images are fantastic and very vivid. The only problem that I have had is with reds. The reds are way too saturated and you lose all detail, which is sort of a deal-breaker.Video quality:Video quality is good. Nothing special, just good.Performance:This is the area in which the camera really falls behind. This camera is just plain SLOW. You push a button and have to wait a minute for anything to happen. Now, I have to say that it does work well sometimes, but most of the time it is highly unresponsive. This is a problem because it leads to a loss of so many good shots. I was trying to take some photos at a soccer game and missed so many good shots because the camera would just wait 10 seconds after I pressed the shutter button. Even thought the camera has great features, you can't really use them because it is so unresponsive.Overall:I returned this camera a few days after I got it just because of the performance issues. It defeats the purpose of a camera if you can't capture the moments that you want to in the way that you want to.

It was a Kodak and it took great pictures. Several years after that I won a Kodak Z650 in an online contest and flat out loved the pictures it took. So when the stars aligned and Amazon had the Kodak Z990 on sale and my gift card balance was enough to afford it I jumped at the opportunity.I really LIKE the Kodak Z990 and I'm sad that it will probably be the last Kodak camera I ever buy...I LIKE this camera... I almost love this camera. While my Z650 almost never came out of Auto mode I find myself accessing the PASM controls and bracketing the exposure compensation when I use this camera.It isn't that the Z990 doesn't take great pictures. It does. It just takes a little work to get them.The camera is hefty, weighing in at 1 LB. 5 OZ. (593g) and feels substantial. To me it feels like what a camera should. The gripping areas on the front handgrip and rear thumb rest are lightly rubberized and the non-movable ring on the lens has a sturdy ribbed rubber covering.The controls are reasonably easy to access and use. I like that you can use either the 5-way controller (similar to a Kindle's) or the clickable toggle wheel next to the thumb rest to access and control many of the camera settings. I like having the zoom controls on a ring around the shutter button. It feels easier to use than those cameras that have this control on the back. It also requires a very light touch as with 30x total optical zoom the lens and controls are very sensitive. At first you will find yourself zooming or going wide-angle past the point you wanted but with a little practice it becomes much easier to control.The Z990 uses AA batteries (4) which, personally, I think is great. You can, in a pinch, get replacements at any convenience store, gas station or mega-mart in the US. It also comes with a serviceable if feature free slow battery charger and four Kodak brand rechargeable NiMH batteries. I've since replaced these with a smart charger and better batteries but out of the box they're enough to get you started.Another great addition is the Optical View Finder. This is incredibly handy when shooting outdoors in bright sunlight. The 3\" LCD screen is great but in direct sun it, like all LCD screens, becomes almost impossible to see.I've, as of the time of this review, taken a bit over a thousand images and a handful of videos with my Z990 and I've barely scratched the surface of experiencing all the features and functions it has to offer.Some notable features are:Two panoramic image modes. One has the camera stitching two or three images together to produce the image and the other allows you to hold the shutter button and 'sweep' the camera to produce the panoramic image.Multiple Kodak film time emulations - Kodacolor, Kodachrome, Ektachrome, T-MAX, TRI-X as well as standard B&W; and Sepia modes.In camera HDR mode.Multiple burst modes.Full 1080p video in stereo.The camera can even emulates a Photo Booth taking four images in quick succession and stitching them together.Nothing being perfect the Z990 has a few cons I feel need to be mentioned:The memory card is stored in the battery compartment and the battery door is one of the few things I worry about breaking on this camera. It is light plastic and not easy to close with batteries installed.To use a USB cable to transfer images from the camera to a computer the camera needs to be powered up requiring removal of the lens cap (because the cap mounts on the body not the lens). I don't like that it needs to sit with the lens exposed for no reason.The lens isn't threaded so you cannot use any filters with this camera.Preview mode, where the camera shows you the last image taken, cannot be disabled on this model, you can bypass it somewhat by 1/2 pressing the shutter once the preview displays but it would have been nice to be able to turn off this feature.In conclusion:While the Kodak Z990 Max isn't perfect it is an affordable bridge camera that takes excellent pictures day or night with an extremely powerful zoom lens, a host of useful features and controls that can only be topped by DSLR cameras.

I hesitantly purchased this one because of the battery requirements but thought that I had such good luck with the EASY Share cameras in the past - how could I go wrong!  I bought this for a trip that I was taking to Italy and also purchased a battery converter for over there.  The camera is/was a complete disappointment. The first issue was when you first turn the camera on (insert new batteries or memory card) the camera is \"processing\" (which is clearly stated on the screen for what seems like 3 or 4 minutes - it takes a good deal of time for it to ready itself for action which was completely aggravating!) The battery life was horrible (and still continues to be and I bought two extra sets of batteries (from Kodak) - these far outcry the double battery pack that was needed for my Z1015.) There is a huge delay after taking a shot when the battery starts to wain and so taking repeated shots was virtually impossible at that point!The extended zoom was nice except when you really wanted it to zoom in, the shot would completely blurr so you had to back way off of it and then take the pic.  I bounced between all of the settings (landscape, flower, sunset, bright light, night landscape) and the others - but this camera just didn't cut it.  Having the extra zoom capacity ruined this Easy Share camera - Kodak should have stuck with the trend they were on and kept the batteries the same - the 4 AA batteries needed just aren't cutting it and to recharge is/was a real inconvenience!I wish I could say something better as I was really looking forward to the added zoom benefit - but this camera is not worth what I paid for it and I would caution anyone else that is considering purchasing this camera to look elsewhere ...in all honesty I am hoping that I just got a lemon!I am now looking for a new camera because I just got back from my trip and found that I cannot return it because it can only be returned  within a month's time frame and I have had the camera for 5 weeks!

It is completely unacceptable in my opinion and really makes the camera frustrating and hard to use.Realistically, the time between shots can be as long as 15 seconds. Seriously, 15 seconds!! You focus, bracket, shoot and then nothing. You try to half press the shutter to focus on the next shot but nothing happens...you stare at the screen to see what the problem is and repeatedly press the shutter...and nothing....you press the shutter a couple of more times and nothing....then the processor catches up and....bango...it takes a picture because you had pressed the shutter 5 seconds ago!!!....then the same delay starts all over again and the camera is effectively locked out while the processor tries to catch up. It is maddening. I missed dozens and dozens of shots because the camera would not shoot (I was using a Class 10 SDHC card).Heaven forbid you use the \"burst\" mode...after you fire off 4 or 5 shots, the camera processor is overwhelmed for a good 30 seconds while it tries to process the images and you can use it for anything. If you get the rhythm of the camera, you can shoot one picture and immediately half press the shutter and get your frame in focus and bang off another shot, but that is about all the buffer can take, and you will wait approximately 15-20 seconds before you can take another picture.The picture and video quality is pretty good to excellent, hence the 2 stars - but the processor lag is really a joke and makes the camera almost unusable unless you shoot a bunch of non-moving subjects or people with a lot of patience.

Because this great and well built camera, with great functions LAKS CUSTOM WHITE BALANCE, the burst mode slowness, the slow autofocus and intermittent responsiveness.But for the price is a great camera.I seriously recommend this camera for a TRUE beginner, that take family shots, still shots and want something better that a portable but cheaper than a DSLR.BTW, I moved to a Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "malfunctions", "Author": "Denise B. Mikkelsen", "ReviewID": "R995E3WGM4PGQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera 13 months ago - when it worked it worked very well - however, the camera has frozen up for no reason!  We took it on vacation last month, and could not use it - much to our dismay.  When we contacted Kodak, they said that it was 1 month past the guarantee and would do nothing about it.  EXTREMELY upsetting.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA - in fact, do not buy Kodak period.  Their support staff is overseas, and there is no one to really talk to, and the web sites for problem shooting are USELESS!  I can't state this strongly enough - do not buy this camera.  UPDATE:  Since I last published this, we sent it in to have it fixed - fortunately we had a 3 year warranty we purchased through Amazon.  It turns out they had to replace the entire circuit board!  So I was right - this is NOT a good product.  The place that repaired it indirectly indicated this was a common problem.  So, Kodak, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Auto Mode is great. Manual Mode is like trying to drive an army tank.", "Author": "John Sturgeon", "ReviewID": "R2BW7ZWV4IJ5MO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kodak EasyShare Z990 works great in Auto Mode, but in Manual Mode it feels like you are trying to drive an army tank, in low gear.Using a camera only in Auto Mode - any camera, even if it is a DSLR - is simply using the camera as a glorified \"Point-and-Shoot\" camera. That is fine if that is how someone wants to use the camera, but then an honest review of the camera is, \"The Kodak EasyShare Z990 works really well as a point-and-shoot camera.\"  Which it does.I've had mine for just over a year now, and though I get it out and use it sometimes - because I enjoy the challenge, I guess - at this point I am about out of patience with it for anything except Auto Mode and the HDR feature.As a \"Bridge\" camera - meaning a \"bridge\" somewhere between a Point-and-Shoot and a full DSLR - using Manual Mode, no, it does not work quite so well.On any camera, when you are using Manual Mode you have to set three settings - ISO (film speed), Shutter Speed, and Aperture (size of the hole in front of the lens) - just to take your first shot. Every other camera I ever worked with let me change a setting by one or two clicks to create a new setting. Not the Kodak Z990.  It does not remember anything if you start try to make any change to a setting.Some of the default settings in Manual Mode on the Kodak EasyShare Z990 are just plain backwards. If you want to set the ISO, the camera defaults every time to ISO 6400. For daytime shooting you want just the opposite, either an ISO 125 or ISO 200. But the camera always defaults to ISO 6400, and each time you have to click your way all the way down to ISO 125 to set it.  Then suppose you want to try the same shot at ISO 200. Does it remember you are on ISO 125, just one click away? Nope. You click on the ISO icon again and have to start all over again at ISO 6400 and work your way all the way down to ISO 200 and set it - again.Ready to set the next setting, shutter speed?  Same process. You have to start at the fastest shutter speed of 1/2000 sec and click your way all the way down to the one you want.  If you are trying to take a long-exposure night shot say at 16 seconds, then you literally have to run through every other setting to get there.  And some of the menus choices - like starting at a shutter speed of 1/2000 and dropping it down to 16 seconds - are on 3 different pages.  When you get to the end of each page in the menu, you have an extra step.  Question mark, do you want to go to the next page? (Of course) Okay, then click the \"next\" arrow, go to the next page of the menu and go through that page in the same way, then click the question mark again, and do it all over again on the third page of the menu.Then suppose after you take that one shot at 16 seconds you decide you want to try another shot with a couple of seconds less shutter speed instead? Does it remember you are on 16 seconds, just one click away?  Nope. You have to start all over at 1/2000 second and repeat the whole process all over again, page after page, until you finally get there.Are you finally ready to set the third setting, Aperture?  Same slow, tedious process each time.  It's a terrible pain to work with.You have to do this every single time you make a single change to one of your settings. Any attempt to make any change throws you all the way back to the original default setting for that feature every single time.Trying to use the Kodak EasyShare Z990 as a Bridge camera in Manual Mode feels like you are trying to drive an army tank, in low gear.5 stars for how well the camera works in Auto Mode. But 1 star for how hard it is to work with - as an actual bridge camera - in Manual Mode.  Since most people here seem to be using it mostly in Auto mode, then I'll give it a 4-star rating for use as a point-and-shoot camera - only.  For anything else, I simply wouldn't recommend it, unless you really need to save money, and so it's worth it to you to go through all of that cumbersome process every time you try to use it in the Manual Modes of a standard bridge camera.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best camera I ever had!", "Author": "Anne Bellone-Couvertier", "ReviewID": "R3V132U1DWLW5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no expert when it comes to cameras but I have to say, this is the best darn camera I have ever owned.

For years I owned and used a Pentax camera with a built in light meter so depth of field, shutter speed etc. were part of the picture taking experience and equation.....and very time consuming.  The Z990 does all the calculations for you if you match up the choices given with your photo situation.  All the buttons, levers, are much easier to use than my 1st Kodak camera.  There was definitely thought behind the design of the Z990.  I have had to purchase a card reader to transfer pictures to my IMac computer.  The 1st Kodak camera could use the cable and transfer all pictures without taking out the card. VIEWFINDER----on sunny days I couldn't live without this necessary feature.

I have had Olympus, Nikon, Canon small compacts and an older Kodak 10X zoom and the kodak has always taken pictures on par with the Canon, with more menu choices. This is the best compromise between a compact & a SLR. The zoom is fantastic and a huge improvement over my 10X kodak zoom, no blurring in optical zoom whatsover. I videotaped a show and there was very minimal movement, my 10x kodak zoom was so hard to keep steady during videotaping. I was in Santa Fe earlier this year on vacation and my canon compact just did not do justice to the scenery. I would like to go back there with this camera. It is bulkier, but the pictures it takes are worth it. I will still keep the small compact point & shoot in my pocketbook but I have a feeling this camera will accompany me more often.

The fully automatic setting is too automatic -- moreso than in earlier models.  Following the manufacturer's suggestion I use the P mode which is as fully automatic and I want and does not over correct pictures -- the setting screens can be hidden.  The battery issue came up immediately and led to the purchase of a new charger.  The quick charger provided by Kodak has prongs that are shorter than American standard length -- I learned from the replacement charger that they are Chinese length.  The result was that the charger tended to disconnect from the electric service thereby not fully charging the batteries.  A new charger handled this problem.

In those respects, I'm not disappointed.  I use the camera primarily to take shots of live entertainment,  trying to get action shots for a 40 minute set, then shutting it off for 30 minutes and repeating the process twice each night. I use 3-4 sets of batteries to accomplish that so I am always using fresh strong batteries.  The battery charger that came with the camera takes 6-7 hours to charge the battery but I invested in a faster charger that takes only about 45 minutes.  The camera works relatively well when I first turn it on each time.  If I can actually get it to focus in time to catch the shot I want, which is rare, then the picture is awesome.  Taking 2 - 3 shots in a row isn't possible due to the ridiculously long time it takes to process & re-focus. The longer I use the camera each night, the worse it gets.  By the end of the night I' getting blurs and streaks of light, missing pixels, shots where half of the picture is awesome but the other half has blurs, streaks and areas where nothing was captured at all.  Can't tell you how many times I've ended up with pictures of the floor because I've given up, started to walk away and then the camera decides to finally focus & shoot. I usually get 25-50 good shots for every 200-300 I take, then give up and bring out the DX6490.  Extremely disappointing.  If you're taking an occasional family portrait or have unlimited patience & time to focus, this is an ok camera.  Even when taking still shots, the focus time is so long I often get shots of people walking away in disgust rather than the smiles they were showing while they waited for me to focus.  The HD features have never worked, even when using a tripod.  The camera freezes up every time I try to use the multi-shot feature - I have to remove the battery to shut it off when that happens.  The video quality is great, even in low light, but drains the battery rapidly.  I've sent the camera back once.  They installed new firmware but said there was nothing wrong with the camera.  I guess they must have tested it only for a minute or two.  I got it back with exactly the same issues it had when I sent it in. I know my issues aren't isolated due to the number of complaints I've seen from others having the same problem. Now with Kodak on the brink of bankruptcy, I'm reluctant to send it back again.

The camera is slow and that makes for a lot of frustration when you are asking people to pose for more than one photo or when you want that perfect shot as you are walking down the streets of New York City.  I have a Class 10 card.  One recommendation is to reduce the megapixels.  I will give this a try.That said, this camera takes incredibly bright interior photos with wonderful clarity.The zoom works fairly seamlessly and it is an amazing value to get 30x digital zoom on a camera for less than $200.I tried the fast burst mode and the camera froze up.  I had to give up on it.  It may have also been due to the fact that the batteries were getting low.Regarding the battery life - I bought the bundle for $26.95 that was offered by Butterfly Photo. It included a Vivitar charger and 4 VPower batteries.  With this combination, the camera has impressive battery life.  I walked around NYC and turned the camera on and off hundreds of times.  I then viewed the photos on the camera on the bus ride home.  Two days later I was still able to take pictures.  So no complaints about battery life with these batteries.More updates to follow.  It is not a fair comparison when stacked up against a Canon EOS Rebel T2i.  The Canon comes with a 3x optical zoom lens and retails for around $650 and has impressive picture-taking speed.  The Kodak lumbers along, but offers a 30x optical zoom and decent picture quality.I will provide some photo samples at a later date.I am going to figure out how to make this camera perform!March 27, 2012 Update:This camera is definitely a mixed bag.  I used the \"Stage\" setting option and it worked great for zooming in on people on stage in low light, but whited out the people on stage in my photos of the entire stage.  The video option of singing performers was also excellent, but it takes a lot of memory since it's HD.  The camera definitely works in low lighting, but is better in zoom mode for some reason. I got some fairly clear close ups.The camera is also very slow, so you don't really have the opportunity to capture all the action.  That said, with the noise turned off, it is completely silent unlike digital slrs, so you won't be bothering anyone if you make sure that the flash and the beeping sound is turned off.I also have no complaints with the battery life. It is perfectly respectable.  I took photos on and off for almost an entire 2 hour show (I left camera on in between photos) and the batteries were still okay at the end of the show. On one trip, however, the camera froze and I was worried that the camera was broken, but this was not the case.  The batteries had died and the camera was stuck in \"on\" mode, but I couldn't turn it off or do anything.  That was a little frustrating.  I wouldn't recommend that you let this happen if can figure out when the batteries are getting close to dead.  I am using Vivitar VPower 2100mAh rechargeables.  I think that they came with the Butterfly Photo kit for the camera that was about $24 - a deal!It should be noted that I had the camera freeze up on many several times after using the zoom lens for a few minutes and zooming in and out.  See my update below. It only gets worse...July - August 2012Well, after using this camera around ten times or less, the camera started to malfunction.  It continually beeped and a blue screen came on stating that the lens cap was on - when of course it wasn't. I tried turning off the camera, removing the batteries, etc. but no luck.  This same message came up repeatedly.  Finally I packed up the camera and brought it back to Best Buy. I had purchased it online and opted for the extended warranty.  Several weeks later I received a call that the camera was not repairable, so I could come in and pick out a comparable camera or get a prorated gift card.  So there you have it.  A camera that is less than 9 months old and not repairable.  I will be heading to Best Buy soon to see what I can get in replacement.  Good Luck with this camera and hope this doesn't happen to you.  This camera produces some gorgeous photos - at least I have seen many from a friend who has had great results.

Specifically, a camera with customizable video.  You can customize the pictures pretty well, but none of the adjustments you make to the settings alter the way the video looks.  For example, I can increase the camera's brightness for shooting a low-light subject, but when I start recording video, none of the changes are applied to it.  All of the video settings are automatic, so recording something dark won't be helped by adjusting the settings.I know that the camera is mainly meant for recording still images. Nonetheless, the specification-list for the camera shows all kinds of manual controls, and I am very disappointed that these do not apply to taking videos.  What's more, even the user manual has a combined section on taking pictures and videos.  This section refers to changing all these settings, even though they can't be used with videos.  And by the way, the focus during videos gets pretty crazy, too, sometimes.  At least it does when recording basketball games.  I suppose it just can't keep up with that kind of motion or depth of field.Bottom line:  Great for pictures (and I do mean that), but poor for videos.  But a photographer/videographer's needs aren't universal.

Initially, I was very pleased with it. Right out of the box, it performed admirably, taking great pics. That said:***DISCLAIMER** I don't consider myself an avid/experienced/knowledgeable photographer. What constitutes a \"good\" picture in my opinion may look like crap to a pro or seasoned amateur. YMMVThe Good:The feature set was highly attractive (HDR, panorama, viewfinder- great for sunny days, etc). I found the menu interface functional, if not exactly intuitive. The flash is good, and the LCD screen doesn't leave much to be desired. Overall, due to its faux SLR body, it feels pretty good in the hands as well. In my limited experience, it has produced quality photos in a myriad of lighting conditions. I also enjoy the freedom of its use of AA batteries, as you don't have to sit around waiting for a battery pack to charge if it gets depleted.The Not-So-Good:The chief complaint I have against this camera is its speed (or lack thereof). I'm not referring to shutter speed, but the speed at which it captures photos. It's slow to react to the shutter button, it's slow to write the image to the memory card, and it's slow to return for the next shot.With regard to the initial shutter press, I've tried fooling with AF settings, face detection, flash, and a few others to see if I could get a better response. Nothing seemed to help much. When it comes to writing the photos to the memory card, I diligently ensured that I had nothing slower than a Class 10 SD card (name-brand, at that) on deck. After looking around some camera sites and forums, I discovered that this is a normal aspect of this camera (perhaps one of the concessions made to keep the price point low). Concerning setting the camera up for the next pic, I learned that half-pressing the shutter button would interrupt the standard after-shot-preview and ready the camera for another shot. However, this can be hit-or-miss. I've found that when the camera's busy, it caches your actions and fulfills them later (shutter presses, zooming, menu button presses, etc).The Point:In all reality, were it not for the soul-crushing slowness of this camera, I'd be completely and utterly satisfied with it. However, that not-so-insignificant drawback is what has me looking for something else. The final straw came in when, on several occasions, I sought to capture a moment (planned or otherwise), and I simply could not because of how long it would take this thing to fire off a picture. Imagine trying to get a few pictures of kids (whom you know won't sit still for long), and it takes upwards of 10-15 seconds to capture subsequent pictures of a pose or scene. I would often end up having to whip out my phone, which defeats the purpose of having a dedicated camera device. Phone cameras are nice and all, but they can't hold a candle to the real thing.If you're considering purchasing this camera, be very aware of its speed issues. But don't just take my word for it, read plenty of reviews (and not just here on Amazon).

Sadly this Z990 has turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.  I loved the my other 2 cameras, the most recent being a P712, the dock was great for both transferring photos and recharging the batteries, the cameras were easy to operate, and I got great photos.  The camera rested on the Kodak EasyShare dock and was always charged and ready to go.  I ESPECIALLY LOVED THE KODAK EASYSHARE SOFTWARE FOR EDITING MY PHOTOS, I used the software on almost every photo.  Unfortunately, the P712 quit working and I ordered this camera rather quickly. Since this Z990 comes with rechargeable batteries, I wrongly thought this camera would come with a template to fit the EasyShare dock for recharging the batteries like my other cameras.  The batteries are rechargeable, but you have to remove them from the camera, I find the battery cover is not so hard to open, but is very difficult to close again. In my opinion, it is quite inconvenient to have to remove the batteries for charging.  Also, this camera is extremely slow when taking more than one photo.  I have to wait about 10 seconds between each picture, so obviously I miss a lot of shots.  This happens even with brand new batteries.  However the worst thing (for me) is that this camera doesn't sync with the Kodak EasyShare software that is installed on my computer (from my other cameras). Although according to the the Kodak website it should sync with the new camera.  The Kodak website also states that \"EasyShare software is no longer available for download\" and \"sorry for any inconvenience\".

Looks like everybody is dumping the Kodak cameras with the bankruptcy announcement, you can get some good deals.  I look at all point & shoot cameras as being disposable anyway.  This one has a very long zoom lens, not really usable unless you can keep it absolutely steady.  I have gotten some good bluebird pix of the birds on the birdhouse from all the way across the yard.  The main reason I bought this camera was the lens, which focuses much closer than my old camera, although I wish it had a manual focus option, autofocus not always accurate, common to all digital cameras. Battery life is much better than my Z812, probably because it uses 4 pencells instead of two, rechargable cells and charger included with the camera.  Pencells are a big advantage for me, in case your battery goes dead you can get pencells anywhere.  The new \"pre-charged\" cells are much better than old rechargeables, which went dead in two weeks with no use.  Connection to your USB port is a little funny, lens cap has to be off or it gives you an error message.  I like the old Z-812 better which pops the lens cap off for you.  I didn't use any of the included software, just not needed for my use.  I like the free XNVIEW for photo management and editing instead of Kodak's product.  As is usual these days, you have to download the REAL manual from Kodak, the slim included booklet is almost no use.  But only sissies read the manual anyway, just play with it until you figure it out.  Low light performance is better than any other camera I've had, only need the flash to fill in faces on a sunny day.  I like the feature that allows you to turn flash on or off with a convenient button, no fishing thru the menu.

Exactly what is a \"New Model Z990?\"  I wish I knew because I am hesitant to download any Firmware updates.  If it nags me or moans back with too many problems that may be the clue.  First this isn't your basic \"point and Click\" camera.  There are alot of features on this camera and will take awhile to read the downloaded detailed instructions.  That's my first gripe.  Directions that require to be downloaded in PDF format.  The manual that comes with the camera is a short bleep of 4-5 pages showing advanced features that are not explained, hence the PDF \"extended manual.\"  I'd much rather spend $5-$10 extra for the product with the full manual instead of having such a thick small booklet written in many languages--the newest short cut to bundle and save on Regional sales.  Kind of reminds me of calling for tech support and getting 15 voice prompts then no one returns your call.  My philosophy may be a dying breed but I remain defiant until the end.  I got this to zoom in up close on objects without being dark and so far so good.  However I ran into a snag by changing modes and obviously not using them properly which made it impossible to turn off the camera so I resorted to opening the battery compartment slightly and amazingly enough the \"Extended PDF Manual\" said the same when the manual was downloaded--\"beginner's problems.\"  The inclusion of what to do when the camera no longer turns off should have been in the small manual since I thought the settings would be botched but weren't.  It should be great to take close ups when you wish to sell an item showing special markings.  With that being said I can't wait to use the HDR feature and many more.  But this is my first installment of my review.  Best Buy had a sale and Amazon was cheaper though I've noticed the price creep up minimally.  My recommendation is if you are going to buy a camera and this is an excellent one except for intuitive controls and customer support to note what models or dates of manufacturing require the Firmware prevents me giving it an all 5 star rating. I'd recommend buying this way before Xmas 2011 o/w the price is liable to creep up much higher.  I hope to add to my review about everything.

I have a Kodak Z650 6 mp camera that I would LOVE to update.  Thought this was it....NOT!  I am an amateur photographer, just an ordinary mom.  First thing I did was TRY to take some regular pictures on auto mode.  First two pictures took, then camera froze up.  It also took over a minute between pictures with a brand new class 10 SDHC card in!

I worked with this problem off and on for over 6 hours, taking about 200 pictures in different lighting, different settings/modes, different ISO, etc.  While I was doing it, I was taking the SAME pictures with my little old 6 mp Z650 - indoors and out, bright light, no light, and same settings.  Guess which camera wins the contest??  By far!  I am to angry at the moment to  post a side-by-side at the moment, but maybe after a day or two I will.  I really only wanted to update my old camera because the viewing screen is small, there is a VERY superficial scratch on my Schneider lens and it just seems that my old 6 mp needed to be updated. Guess not, I am returning the defective new one and will just remain a happy camper with my old z650.  Oh, and on another note...I bought through Amazon (which I of course love) - shipping was horrible this time!  This camera had NO padding in the camera box or the amazon box!  Just everything floating around inside.  Also, the camera itself looked as if it had been a returned item, not a new one.

I really lowered my expectations significantly since my older camera cost 10x more than this thing. So with that in mind, in short I'll say it's ok if you want a camera for occasional use and don't plan on entering any photography expositions or anything of the sort. Image quality is pretty good for a lower end camera, however being a bit more nitpicky, the lens does suffer from chromatic aberration and softness especially when using more than half of the total available zoom. But that's to be expected, no lens of with this zoom range will be immune to that even if its worth thousands. So with that in mind it's not too bad.The one feature that did exceed my expectations significantly was video quality. It takes a lot of wind for it to be hear don the microphone, and the rolling shutter effect is not terribly obvious. Heck, it takes much better video than my long gone SLR. I really enjoy taking videos with this camera, more so than pictures, my reasoning for that follows...This camera is PAINFULLY slow. I read in other forums that there was a firmware update to fix some of those issues.  First thing I did when I opened the box was update the firmware. I didn't bother doing a before/after comparison between firmwares but if now it's supposed to be \"better\" I dread to think just how slow it was with the old firmware. Doing the firmware update was easy though, just download a file from the kodak website, put it in your SD card put that in the camera, turn it on, and voila.Anyways, the nasty bit: the time between pictures is dreadful, especially in RAW. On average, it takes2-3 seconds for it to take a pic between shots in JPEG. In RAW however, it takes a ridiculous 10 seconds, if not more, even in favorable conditions. Shutter lag is pretty bad too, even with focus set to manually to infinity. Seems to be up to 1 sec at times. I've changed setting as much as possible to reduce this lag but there's not much to change really that would help. Oh and forget about using the camera at all for well over a minute after shooting in burst mode. Several times it has frozen for up to two minutes while writing the burst pictures. And by freezing, well this camera does it in a strange way: it doesn't actually crash, but what happens is that it will go back to the live view mode, and you can \"see\" what the camera sees, but other than that EVERY other function of the camera is locked out. And it will stay there until it's done writing the damned pictures. It actually does this for every picture you take, how long it freezes up just depends on the quality and quantity of the pics you take.I know for a fact my SD card isn't to blame, as I tried several on it. The camera's processor is just ridiculously slow. With that in mind, you're much better off transferring pictures from the camera to your PC by plugging the SD card directly to your PC via an adapter. Using the provided USB cable to connect your PC to the camera and transferring pics over that way is another exercise in testing your patience. Transferring 1gb of pics through the camera to my PC was taking over 15 minutes. When I plugged in the SD card directly to my PC transferring the EXACT same files took less than 3 minutes.At this price point I have tried many cameras, some much cheaper, and none were as painfully slow as this one. I find that inexcusable. So for that alone there's two stars gone.Also I found the extended manual (yes, I read every single page, I'm probably the only person in the world that reads manuals despite being very tech savvy) almost insulting to my intelligence. It's very dumbed down. Then again, so is the camera, there's not much to it really. The menus are kind of awkward and slow to access if you're used to the speedy menus SLRs and other big name cameras offer. Otherwise, it's pretty simple to learn, though not always intuitive.The batteries and charger that come with it aren't the best, but that was to be expected for a \"free\" bundle. The charger won't even let you know when the charge is finished. And the 8 batteries that came with it still show only 1/4 charge after more than 24 hours of charging, maybe they just have to be broken in still, but every other NiMH cells I've used show a full charge even when brand new, so who knows.I'm only keeping this camera because I'm impressed with the amount of zoom and the quality of the videos. The pictures aren't half bad either, if you can live with the painfully slow performance.So if you're one of those people that doesn't know what a jpeg, RAW, or chromatic aberration is and never bothers to read the manuals, this is the camera for you. For the rest of you, this is an acceptable \"beater\" camera.

Austin", "ReviewID": "R2WF80Z10RP7GT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was a Christmas gift for my oldest daughter, who wanted a camera with a big zoom on it. Compared to other brands it seemed like a pretty good deal, but in the end it's just not very satisfying to use.On the plus side, it has a relatively fast lens (2.8 I think) and the backlight sensor should in theory improve low light performance. The zoom is massive and the camera has a nice solid feel to it. The menu can be a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it you'll find a nice variety of features and settings.On the negative side, the LCD is awful. Now, maybe I'm biased since I use a DSLR or the nice bright viewfinders of my old medium format film cameras, but this doesn't even compare to a decent point and shoot. Colors looked washed out and movement is jerky. But even that doesn't compare to how sluggish the camera is after pressing the shutter. I've seen from other reviews that holding down the shutter half-way after taking a picture can bypass the glacial shooting interval, but I've never had much luck getting that to work. Instead it's take a picture, wait a few seconds, and take another one. Not what you'd expect from a digital camera in 2012. The shutter button itself feels like you're pressing a wet noodle, so that doesn't make doing the 'half-press' trick any easier.Unfortunately these problems are found on a lot of 'prosumer' cameras in this price range. So I really don't know whether this Kodak is any worse than a comparable Nikon or Canon mega-zoom. My suggestion is to forget the big zoom and find a camera with a good low light lens that takes fast pictures. A Canon S100 is a good example. You'll do better taking a good picture at 5x zoom and cropping it than trying to take a 20x zoom shot and hoping it doesn't come out a blurry mess.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Owned over a year", "Author": "gjgordon", "ReviewID": "R34RY1SQGEO0IC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Owned over a year.

I like the Nostalgic color film effects. I almost always use the Ektachrome choice, for Nostalgic color, because I like the extra color saturation, especially indoors with no flash but, I use that setting for outdoors too.I also like the scene modes.

The low price of this camera is what allows me to afford it and have fun with it.I'm sure the Canon Powershot SX40 HS or the Nikon Coolpix L810 are much better digital bridge cameras but I can't afford them and I like Z990's Nostalgic color modes and simple scene mode choices and an ISO speed that is faster than 3200.

We loved our last Kodak- but this one really shows that Kodak's design and quality has taken a turn for the worse.First- most of the adjustments for this camera are needlessly complex.  Rather than having physical buttons or easy electronic menus for quick setting changes- this camera forces you to scroll through several electronic setting menus just to make simple changes.  Extremely annoying when you just want to change from one setting to another in a hurry.Secondly- this thing is a beast.  It's absolutely huge and heavy.  While on some cameras this gives an impression of quality- on this one it's just annoying.Third- Lastly and most importantly- no matter what setting this camera is using- it has a delay that is simply inexcusable.  If the camera doesn't sense that something is in perfect focus- it won't let you take the picture until after the camera senses that your subject is in perfect focus.  On most cameras- this is handy- it takes a half a second.  On this camera, both my wife and I grew tired of waiting for the camera- usually for 5 or 6 seconds.  (other times it would take pictures immediately).  In addition, there is often a three-to-five second delay between when you attempt to zoom in/out and when the camera actually does it.  It makes it extremely tough to focus quickly on anything.  We have spoke to Kodak (surprising considering they are filing for bankruptcy) and they indicate that what we are describing is completely normal for this model camera.  They are very sorry that we are unhappy, but refuse to perform any warranty work on it as they deem it to be functioning normally.  (Which is strange, because most of the other comments mention nothing of this problem- so it causes me to believe that the camera isn't functioning properly)  A last comment regarding this issue- I am someone that is extremely comfortable using technology, so this is not user error.My wife and I purchased this camera to take pictures of our newborn.  Unfortunately, because of the delay problems, we simply can't get the pictures we want- as by the time we grab the camera, get it to focus properly, and then get the camera to actually take the picture- the baby stopped smiling, or stopped doing whatever it was that made you want to take the picture in the first place.Luckily, Amazon's customer service is awesome.

And what I first learned about this camera is that it takes really decent pictures in high light and all of the modes it provides. And with the options it gives you in \"manual\" mode, it really lets you customize how you want you photo.On the other hand, this camera boasts a top 6400 iso. Iso is tricky on any camera but this one is practically useless after 400 iso. The images are just horrible.Now about the auto-focus. As much as I \"like\" this camera. This continuous AF has driven me up the wall. So it's likely you'll want to use the single AF.Video on this camera is on par with the quality of photos. Not the best but it's still 1080p and is relatively smooth if it's on a tripod. Zoom is exceptional.I like this camera. but it won't be staying around for very long. It has literally driven me to take the step to get a entry level DSLR.

At first I thought it was just me getting used to the camera and all of the \"wonderful\" features and lenses (even though this was not my first camera) By the time I figured out that it wasn't user error, I had had it to long to return, so looks like I'm stuck with an expensive paperweight! All of the \"Creative mode\" and \"artistic mode\" features cannot be used as no matter what you do to steady the camera, you get the \"cannot be processed, hold camera steady\" blah blah blah!! I gave up on even trying to use them. The smart capture does ok, provided your not worried about missing the shot due to the wait time between shots, and the zoom that is oh so slow, and sometimes just stops mid zoom. Battery life?? I thought maybe the 4 rechargeable batteries were old, so I bought brand new ones, then I though the charger was bad, so I threw it out and bought a new one....long story short, you could hook this thing up to a nuclear reactor and maybe get a couple dozen shots! As it is, fully charged batteries will get you 15-20 shots before you have to switch batteries for the next 15-20 shots, and regular AA batteries...forget it....two shots and the camera has eaten them for lunch!I was so excited to get this product, but I am very disappointed.

Not sure why, but when I was using it initially it was real glitchy, would not let me take a vertical shot for some reason, kept shutting itself off even when the battery meter read two-thirds full, etc. I used another set of rechargable batteries and it was fine--so, I guess the batteries which came with the camera were faulty. When I called Kodak, directly, they were the ones who told me that Li-ion AA's would not work with this camera, although another reviewer in response to my original post said they work fine.

KODAK said in their pre-sales literature that the camera should take at least 500 photos per set of batteries. They should have indicated what brand and strength that they used because it sure wasn't theirs! I got some DURACELL 2000 mAh NI-MH batteries and fully charged them. They yield 200 photos.
