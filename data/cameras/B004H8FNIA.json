I selected it because I wanted a good camera that could live in my pocket because I don't like carrying around a camera case -makes you a target and you look like a tourist.  You can't put a camera in your pocket that has one of those pop-out lenses because dust gets into them.  Been there, don't that. Needs to be dust proof like this camera. Dont put anything metal in that pocket or you will scratch the thing to heck. Always use the wrist strap so you don't drop it while shooting.Pictures and video are amazing for the size of this thing. Battery lasts about 45 min of continuous shooting/video.  If you need more then get an extra battery for only $10.  I did but I haven't needed it yet!My only con: lens is right where my finger wants to be but I got used to it after a few days.  But be sure to warn people when you hand it over to someone else.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, for being low end.", "Author": "J.F.", "ReviewID": "R29SSX9R6NRVC3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the camera quickly from Amazon.com and I was impressed how the packaging was done from sony, tight, small, minimal.I was able to play with this camera for a few days before I finally decided to return it though. The camera takes amazing macro shots up close to a variety of items. The zoom is ok for being 4x optical. I've never owned such a slim camera before, and I was impressed how the zoom didnt extend out of the body. Having the slide up/down cover was also nice for protecting the Carl Zeiss lense.Probably my biggest negative issue with the camera is the touch screen. With other touch screen cameras having multi touch, and being responsive, I felt like I was using a touch screen from 5+ years ago. You had to press hard and where you wanted to touch. I was heavily dissapointed because of the cost of the camera, and how poor the touch screen sensitivity, and resolution was. You can literally see the gaps between each pixel, and it's to the point you cant even tell if you're last shot photo is sharp or not.Another issue was the quality of the images. Sure they're 16.1MP, but they arent the greatest. My old 7MP canon SD1000 took better photos at a smaller file size. A camera this expensive should atleast perform better.For the specs of this camera, I'd look into Sony's other cameras. Let style and thinness slide by this time, get performance and quality in another camera instead.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!", "Author": "Jane Austin", "ReviewID": "R3CS69EYPBLF29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

Everyone LOVES it.  Can't go wrong?  Right?  Not with mine.  In fact, HALF of every picture is blurry no matter what setting I place it on.  Some pictures, using the flash mode, white out completely.  If the picture isn't blurry and out of focus, it's too bright or too dark.  And low light pictures are horrible!  I constantly get an annoying message \"PROCESSING\" in which EVERY photo when it does that is unrecognizable.  Not to mention, after taking maybe, what, 20 pictures the low battery light comes on and the thing literally DIES.  Unbelieveable for 200 dollars.  Skip it and try another model.

I had another touchscreen Sony and wanted to upgrade.  This is TINY, takes amazing pictures and videos, is easy to operate, and the intelligent-automatic won't let you make a mistake.  I am very gentle with my cameras, but found that the playback mode was 'jumping' for some reason.  I guess even Sony can have a glitch but Amazon was awesome.  They had the new one in the mail before I could package the old one up.  I do agree that the lens is a little high and I took a few pictures with my fingers hanging over, but I took care of that.  After 3 weeks and a lot of summer pictures I did not have one red eye, not one blurred picture, and the battery life is fantastic.  My old Sony touch-screen allowed me to crop and save on the camera, but this one doesn't do that. It does allow for panaramic view pictures and the videos I took in the sun and toward twilight were perfect.  I'm hoping the replacement camera will come soon ... and the fact that I had to replace a camera after 3 weeks of easy use (with case for protection) is why I gave it 4 starts.  The actual useage I experienced would qualify for 5 stars.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera..grest value for its price...great quality...", "Author": "A10", "ReviewID": "R1OS8M904ABC5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome...1.

Sizewhat i love about it is its size...i was afraid the camera was too small for my big hands...but when i used it..i fell in love it..(93.0mm x 55.6mm x 16.8mm)..you can carry it around wherever you go..you can put it in your pocket..purse..etc...3. Ease of usei read some reviews about people complaining about the ease-of-use of this camera..or that the instruction manual is not that good..to be frank..i've never read it..cause it's very easy to get to know all the features in your camera and how to use them..just play around with it for a couple of hours..and believe me..you'll get to know everything:)4. Touch ScreenThe touch screen is awesome..and very responsive...i bought a protective cover for it (BoxWave Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector (Single Pack) ) for 6.25$ and the touch screen was still very responsive even after i applied the cover to the touch screen..i recommend you buy one to protect your touch screen.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KN1IC6/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details5. BatteryThe battery life is not that good..but you can always buy an extra battery, which i did (BestDealUSA NP-BN1 Battery for Sony CyberShot DSC-TX9 TX5 WX5 TX7) for about 6$http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J9YLAC/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details6. Quality of pictures and videosOne word: awesome...HD movies...great pics when shooting at 16mp...PS: when shooting at 16mp..you will not have full screen...unlike when shooting videos..you can zoom while shooting videos..what i like the most..is that the lens does not come out and in as most of the cameras...as this might cause lots of problems (some lenses freeze in cold and get stuck)the pics quality was nice in low light places..the auto mode can make your life easier..even in dark places.7. Featuresi love the sweep panorama feature...there are 3 levels of smile detection..there are multiple modes...you can change the color of the menu (white, black, and pink)..and you can read the rest of the product details on the product details...8. Notes*The delivery took only 3 days.*always use the wrist strap when shooting images or videos..you don't want your camera to fell down..*Buy a carrying case for it..i recommend (Sony LCS-CST General Purpose Soft Carrying Case for Slim Cybershot Digital Cameras)which is great for the T110.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00091S0WA/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details*I also recommend you buy (Sony 8 GB PRO-HG Duo HX Memory Stick MSHX8A (Black))which i also bought for my T110...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F8UWUM/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_detailsBottom line: great camera..worths the 150-170$...easy to use..easy to carry around...nice features...HD movies..great quality pics...i highly recommend it", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "rox", "ReviewID": "R31FKMEE2TF1ZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

It has face recognition, so even when you are taking a picture with lighting behind your subject, the face comes out great.  It will fit in the tiniest purse, but has all the options of the bigger cameras. I just love it.

The quality of the pictures taken outdoors are as good or better than you would expect from a camera with a lens this size. They images are more than adequate for Facebook and printing 4x6s. Photos taken in lower light conditions are grainy but not any more so than I would expect.This review would have been 4 stars if it were not for one single problem. The camera ships without a charger but does include what looks like a micro USB cable.The included cable is actually NOT a micro USB cable but a proprietary Sony cable that looks like micro USB. Having brought only a mini and micro USB to charge everything else I own I was unable to charge the camera.I spent three hours scouting the tourist areas of Prague for a means to charge this camera. I finally gave up and paid twice retail for another camera to use for the remainder of my trip.When I returned home I bought a universal battery charger. I must have figured I had plenty of micro USB cables and tossed the cable that came in the box. If I travel with this camera again I will bring a pocket full of charged Sony 'N' batteries.I can't begin to understand why Sony would do something like this. I thought they would have learned their lesson with the Sony memory stick saga.

Sony told me that is not covered under warranty for dropping it. So the camera still worked at least the screen was just cracked. Now about 30 days later it's making a grinding noise like fan is hitting something and the pictures are all blurry. The motor for the focus must be messed up is my guess. I've dropped my old Sony cameras (such as DSC-T7) many of times and they never broke or anything.I rarely leave bad reviews but this one really made me angry. Sony basically stole $200 from me in 60 days. In a sense I learned to never byu anything from Sony again. Their TVs are a rip off when Samsung's are just as good for less the price. Sony's Android tablet breaks easy from what I've read and the screen is not scratch proof.All Sony products are now cheaply made. The only person I would say is ok with this camera is if you plan to mount it on a wall and never put it in your pocket or have any chance of banging or dropping it.I've heard Canon is a bit more helpful when these break.
