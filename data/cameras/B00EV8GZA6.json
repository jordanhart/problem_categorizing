For the money, I am delighted that I chose the D3200. It's light weight, and quiet.The tutoring menu is more for beginners, and it has many pre-sets to take creative shots easily. Love the 24MP, and find no noise even shooting at 6400 ISO.I bought it to shoot stills, but it has excellent HD video with slow motion.You do have to run manual with the older lenses, but that has only caused me to up my game.It's the most excellent DSLR value currently available!!", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Water Polo Mamarazzi Recommended", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"US Pinay\"", "ReviewID": "R2BXPIPRTLX9SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this camera to take pictures of my daughter's water polo games.

While this is not a professional camera body, it will meet the needs of any shooter (including professionals who want an inexpensive back-up body).

I decided that it was time for me to upgrade but I wanted to do so at reasonable cost and easy carrying weight. So after doing my research I decided on the D3200. I made the correct choice. I find that it has more or less the same feel and weight of the D3000 and my teleconverter and lens work  perfectly with it. Additionally, apart from the major upgrade in pixels per image, it focuses very quickly, takes multiple frames in a flash and is ready to shoot even while it is still saving data from a previous shot. The picture quality is very high and if required the supplied software - or any similar ones for that matter - allows for all the usual computer processing, I recommend it unreservedly.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Cam Body for the Price", "Author": "flatiron'er", "ReviewID": "RV2XXRP2V7RJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great DSLR body for beginners stepping outside the \"Auto\" realm for the price.

The older Nikon did not take videos, plus there were other improvements I wanted.So far, I'm very impressed with the 3200 -- but at this point in time I'm still learning more about its capabilities.  I haven't yet done much in the way of videos but I will be taking some in the near future.Also, the 3200 allows the use of Nikon's Wireless Mobile Utility -- which you purchase separately, but I think it's well worth the extra cost.  You plug it into the side of the camera body, and when you turn the 3200 on, a green light on the attachment begins to blink.  Then, using a mobile device (in my case, that would be the iPad2, iPodTouch I own or the Samsung Galaxy Centura smartphone my wife recently purchased for herself), you turn on the Nikon app that is associated with the attachment.You can then either use the device as a viewfinder and, if you wish, complete the exposure remotely, or you can download to your mobile device all the exposures that you have taken earlier on the 3200.  Some people have complained that the attachment does not work -- or is unreliable -- but once I got the hang of how it works, found it to work quite well.  (You just have to remember to momentarily move from the WiFi network you're probably on with your mobile device-- the one that you use with your home computer -- and select the network that the Nikon attachment creates as soon as it's plugged into the 3200.  As soon as you're done with the mobile attachment and remove it from your camera, your mobile device usually will switch back automatically to the WiFi network.By the way, because I did not care to sell the older Nikon I had, I'm keeping it and using it in a special way -- I have several pre-digital SLR camera lenses, some of them from a Canon camera I used in the 1970s for work-related projects -- and I located a company that manufactures adapters that allow you to affix the older lenses onto a DSLR.  You're never quite sure what kind of quality you're going to get, but the results can be interesting.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for beginners who want something more than a point and shoot", "Author": "Gail Barsh", "ReviewID": "R2OB7E9F5FFKIO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic bargain.

In college I upgraded to a Contax 139 Quartz.  This was treat for a serious hobbyist.  It took many years after digital imaging arrived before I put a toe in the water.  My wife and I picked up a cheap point and shoot 3mP for a vacation.  One of the shots won an award at a local festival.  This changed my mind about digital.As an interim jump we picked the FugiFilm FinePix S9000.  What makes this camera shine is the FinePix picture engine, great low light and flash photos and a comfortable sealed unit.  It also uses AA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.  These features make it a great camera for travel everywhere.  Poster sized enlargements can be made without distortion.  The downside is that the LCD is small and the eye piece is not through the lens.It was time to upgrade to a true D-SLR.  After conducting extensive research we set our sights on the Nikon line.  Comparing Nikon feature to feature with the competition most things were equal except Nikon cameras felt better in my hands.  The controls, handling and balance were close to my old Contax 139Q.So far the photos have been very good.  The option to go semi or full manual opens up a world of creativity.  Having the ability to work with RAW files also expands artistic options.  I am very pleased with the speed, flexibility and functionality of this unit.  Can't wait to get the WiFi adapter working with an Android device.  The software for this is only available at Google Play for Android.
