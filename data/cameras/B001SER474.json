{"Reviews": [{"Title": "960 vs. 970 vs. 780", "Author": "Mark Twain \"321\"", "ReviewID": "R3QUGORPJSHR8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old tiny Casio Exilim 5 MP camera died- I loved that thing because it was so tiny and I took many more pictures because it fit in my pocket- and I had to get something for my trip to France. First bought the 970 thinking, ooh, 5x optical zoom. For someone used to ultracompact, that thing was huge and I didn't notice much difference between the 5x and the 4x or 3x zoom. I returned it and got the 960, which I stuck with. It is much smaller than the 970 though bigger than my old camera (won't fit in pants pocket too comfortably), but the wide-angle zoom makes a huge difference to the photos. I travelled with someone who had the 780, and we frequently traded the same shot with both cameras, and the picture quality was much better with the 960, though it is larger than the 780. The controls were easy to navigate, the viewscreen very wide/ large on the 960. The video quality is amazing. Aside from the size, the only downside was that it is a little slow to take repeat shots in action situations. However, the motion control is excellent and you can take shots while jogging without blurring. Sadly, I lost my new 960 at the airport (thankfully, I had downloaded the photos). I decided to replace it with the 780 because I'm not a photographer, thought having the very small camera would make up for the difference in picture quality. After 250 photos on the 960, and 2 days with the 780, I miss the wide-angle zoom and am considering getting another 960. It's not that much bigger than the 780, and the picture quality difference is significant.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Still Images, Excellent 720P for the price", "Author": "Producer NY \"NYP\"", "ReviewID": "R1SOB760SVJGKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The true market for this camera is someone who wants to have one device that is compact, shoots excellent quality pictures, and has the capability of capturing 720P HD movies.It's a Canon, so the image quality is a given.  Tons of examples on Flickr if you simply search for \"canon SD960\" or \"IXUS 110\".  Colors are true, not highly sharpened, low chromatic aberration, and rich with detail.  Do not, however, mistake this power of the DIGIC IV processor to be perfect and free of noise at high zoom or ISO above 400.  Compared to its class, however, the results are just great for the price point.But the odds are you are looking at this camera not just for its stills ability, but the fact that it can also shoot HD movies.So how does the HD perform.  Here, the optical stabilization and optical zoom make this a far better choice than it's nearest hybrid competitor, the Flip HD.  The Flip is a fun, very easy to use device, but the lack of image stabilization in camera makes the output very choppy and prone to a \"jello\" wobbling effect.  The Canon has a much smoother output.  A strong performer in low light (but expect more noise) and a really excellent result in natural light.  For samples, my best recommendation is to search Vimeo -- they have the best HD streaming of uploaded videos, and looking at results on Youtube (even if \"HD\") doesn't do the camera justice.In practice, Mac users will be happy to see that iPhoto can handle the whole offload process -- stills and movies.  Launch iPhoto, turn on camera and load what you'd like.  The movie files are H.264, and can be quickly edited in iMovie or Final Cut.One worthy note on shooting movie and zoom.  You frame your shot and set focus with a half push of the shutter button.  Press all the way to record.  Once you start recording, you are set at your original zoom level and can not use the OPTICAL zoom to pull closer.  Instead, the camera uses DIGITAL zoom to get closer.  In practice, I found this did not produce a terribly degraded result, but it is worthy noting before you purchase the camera.Mono mic on the camera, which pics up sound very well -- even on the crowded/noisy streets of NYC.The cheaper Canon SD780 is very nice also if you are looking to save $50.  The newer jog wheel and extra zoom, however, was worth the upgrade (IMHO).Budget for one of the 8G or 16G SDHC cards sold on Amazon for 50+ minutes of HD recording.  And probably worth buying a 3rd party second battery to have on hand.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "As advertised, a good point and shoot", "Author": "A. Soler", "ReviewID": "R2W4RV2AM8OMQC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this camera a month ago just before the Coachella festival, where I shot ~4GB worth of jpgs and ~2GB of video. I used max resolution for both and did not use the fully automatic modes and other gimmicks. Being an all day festival in the desert, I had plenty of opportunity to test the camera under harsh light, shadow, twilight and artificial lighting at night.Video wise no complains; this is not a video camera and whatever you get out of it is a plus IMHO. I got usable footage of bands at night, with reasonable sound quality, and I suspect the image stabilization improved the shots, since I don't have very steady hands.Still photography is another matter. I got plenty of purple fringes under sunlight and way too much noise under low light. Going beyond ISO 400 is reckless, and the lens stops down too much as you start zooming, making matters worse. 12MP is a marketing gimmick; you'll seldom get good enough quality shots that you can enlarge where such resolution would be needed; half the pixel density and much lower noise would yield plenty more enlargement worthy pics.Controls are limited, you can tweak exposure compensation and sensitivity and that's about it. The flash is best for harsh sunlight situations. Having said that, this is a very compact point and shoot, with a very nice LCD and good focusing; a good camera for snap shots and 4x6 prints.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wanted to upgrade, instead I got great HD video with blurry/purple fringed AUTO mode pictures.", "Author": "HiDef Cineza", "ReviewID": "R2O158FOSP2RKN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Unfortunately after 30 days of review and over 1000 pictures later I am returning this camera.As an avid Canon user (Canon AE-1, S500, and S550), I decided it was finally worth the effort to upgrade out of the world of slow compact flash and go with the latest and greatest.  What I found was a major disappointment.PROS:-Size of the camera is great for your pocket.  It slips neatly away and is easy to retrieve.-When pictures are clear, they look great for a point and shoot.-I enjoyed using the wheel interface along with the actual UI that is on the camera.-The HD movies were great both on the computer and played directly to my 46\" Samsung LCD-Transfer speed to the computer was very fast, especially since I am comparing it to my last camera that was the S550.-Battery life was great as well as compared to my S550.  At least twice as much use from the 960.-The HD video constantly adjusted the white balance during capture which was very nice.-Screen was clear and well integrated into the body of the unit.NOTE: I didn't hear any strange sounds when zooming in/out using the movie mode (during playback).CONS:-Bright daylight images would show purple fringing around diffuse edges such as hair, trees, water, etc...  Was made even worse if zoomed.-In AUTO mode the camera constantly thought it should go into MACRO mode and pictures consistently were blurry.  This was even worse at night, and absolutely HORRID if you gave the camera to a 3rd party to take a picture.  3rd parties usually don't use the method where you hold the button halfway so the camera can figure out what's going on.  So feel free to instruct that 3rd party if you like and then you *MIGHT* get a clear picture half the time... and at night you might get 1 out of 10 that are clear.  Even some of the daytime pictures that did not display the MACRO mode in AUTO came out blurry.I'm so disappointed in this camera since I had such high hopes for it.  I researched for at least 8 hours over a period of 4 weeks before I made my purchase.  The Canon SD960IS suffers from great ideas implemented without the final touch that would make it worthwhile.Take my review with a grain of salt; however, I would steer clear of this one until they fix the CCD so it doesn't have nasty purple fringing (which my s500 and s550 never had) and when they fix the firmware in AUTO to go back to manual macro mode.About me:  I am not a professional photographer; however, I would consider myself very capable.  I have developed my own pictures, when I was shooting black and white, in my own darkroom. Also, I am the person that is always called by friends and family when they have a technical question.  If I wanted to take slow pictures where I have to think about shutter speeds, exposures, f stops, etc.. I'll gladly go by the Canon Digital SLR and take the time.  This purchase was not for that.  I want a camera that I or anyone in my family can take halfway decent pictures without thinking too much about it.  At this point my S550 did a much better job.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do NOT use SmartAUTO for Indoor Shots!", "Author": "B-Rad", "ReviewID": "R1M0N03U89ZQ7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I understand they say that everyone's eyes are different, and every camera looks different to every eye.  HOWEVER, I have used, owned, tested and bought enough cameras over the past 4 years to know one simple thing:DO NOT USE PORTRAIT, INDOOR OR AUTO FOR INDOOR PHOTOS OF HUMAN BEINGS for this SD960 model, or likely for any other newer model Canon with SmartAUTO feature.MY Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FS7 (see my other review) has been a stellar performer for all around stills & videos in WVGA (I don't have need for full HD due to fact that I watch my vids on my MacBook, not a 60\" TV).  And the file size is smaller than full HD.After reviewing hundreds of crummy INDOOR photos from this SD960 today (yes, I bought after reading amazing reviews online about the high quality, bright 2.8 aperture 28mm lens) I then decided to play around with the settings.I'm supposed to meet Jon Bon Jovi tomorrow in Costa Rica and wanted to make sure this little camera was set PERFECTLY for a fast, on the fly shot with the rock star!  No time to horse around with settings or ask Jon, \"hey dude.... wait a minute.... need a re-take\".  I plan on buying the new Panasonic LUMIX FX7 but stuck with this little Canon this week.That said, I DISCOVERED A SOLUTION TO CRUMMY INDOOR PHOTOS.  I took dozens of comparison shots (most of my face :) and finally, finally found the answer to my frustration:- First, turn OFF iContrast (do not leave on AUTO) in the menu - helps take away facial glare- Second, go to P MODE which allows you  to override Canon's horrible programming- ISO = leave on auto, most indoor shots go to 250- White Balance = change to Fluorescent (don't worry about light type where you are)- My Colors = change to Positive Film - I tested them all against face, and this brings most natural, sharp tones- Lastly, and the final secret to my success, change EXPOSURE setting to -1/3 (yes, this will help control Canon's obnoxious flash glare against the skin - in addition to shutting down iContrast)* PORTRAIT setting was stuffing each photo at ISO 80, leaving a weird yellowish image* INDOOR & P each used ISO 250 leaving better facial detailWhomever is reading this owes me a beer!  You cannot imagine the difference using this setting for indoor shots of faces and people.  I have 3 images I need to post to prove the difference; PORTRAIT vs INDOOR MODE vs P MODE.  You'll all agree the P setting (above) create a far superior photo from an amateur.Canon should pay me a LARGE consulting fee for figuring this out.  Perhaps, someone at Canon corporate will read this and change the settings in their pre-programmed menu for 2010/2011.  The simple conclusion is:  CANON HAS RUINED PHOTO QUALITY BY INTRODUCING TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY AND SETTING ADJUSTMENTS.  I look back at my 2005 Canon SD220 and many shots look BETTER than ones from newer Canon models.  Hmmm......  case in point?Please post COMMENT - love to hear everyone's results by doing their own \"fine tuning\".Good Luck!", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "HD Video Great, Pictures not better than my SD550", "Author": "Jody \"bigdumptruckdotcom\"", "ReviewID": "R9ZGGRWEQZ1RJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "8-4-09 Update: I think it's time to update my review. I really do love the video this camera shoots. If that's all I wanted it for, this would be a 5-star product. But over time I am getting more and more disappointed with the quality of the photos. Maybe my unit is a dud, but the noise seems to be getting worse. I just think that an outdoor photo, taken in full daylight, should NOT be a noisy as the pix from this camera are. I miss my SD550. I may have to just suck it up an switch back, or look for something else to use as a point and shoot for when I don't want to carry my XTi around with me.==================================I finally upgraded my SD550, which was getting pretty beat up and tired. I was really looking for a >3x optical zoom (4x isn't a huge improvement, but it's enough for a 12.1mp camera) I actually really like the layout on this one, the huge screen (I never used the viewfinder on the 550) and the playback button at the top right.The HD video quality seems good to me (I have a more expensive HD videocamera, so this for me is not going to be used when I know I want to shoot a lot of video), but I found the controls for playback confusing (it's not clear at ALL just looking at the camera that you have to press up on the control wheel and THEN press the set button. The 550 used Set/Set to playback. I have to be careful not to use Set/Set because the first Set launches the delete function (!)I also found the purple lines caused by bright lights to be much more harsh on the 960 than they ever were on the 550. In fact, I had to go back to the 550 to see if it even did that (It did). It's just more noticable on the 960 but that could be because it's filming in HD. There are no purple lines when I am taking still photos (even if you see it on the viewfinder) so you just have to be extra careful about pointing the camera toward the sun if the sun is fairly low in the sky.I'll update this review as I have more feedback.======Update to review on 4/15:  I still like the camera, the HD video quality is AMAZING, but as a pixel peeper, indoor shots tend to be REALLY noisy. Now maybe I shouldn't be zooming that far in on a 12 megapixel image shot indoors, but it is something I want to warn people about. I'm going to try printing one of the noisy shots to see what it looks like when compressed down into a 4x6 size. I also find some of the shots blurrier than I'd like. Like the other reviewer, this was a move from an sd550, and maybe that is just the greatest pocket camera ever, because both of us are a little disappointed with the quality when you compare the two. If the video wasn't so much better, I may have exchanged this one. As of this moment, I'm at about a 3.5.  Will be taking it on vacation next week. More feedback to come.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Vacation Camera EVER", "Author": "HGadget \"HG\"", "ReviewID": "R2DF21IBTCS3YO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought the Canon 960is on a Mediterranean cruise this summer and there is no other camera, video or still, that I would have rather had. For my money this is simply a terrific little camera that will give you terrific stills and better video than you ever thought possible with a great-looking, no-hassle Point 'n Shoot.  The stills were very sharp (the image stabilization is very good) and the colors were accurate and vivid.  I sometimes choose the Vivid Colors or Positive Film setting for more color 'punch' and it never looked overly saturated or grainy.  The Canon 960SI feels well balanced and yet solid in your hand, and is light enough to not make you feel weighed down when you easily slip it into your pocket. I also often choose to use the Wide Angle (16:9) format rather than the normal picture format because I shot a lot of vistas, and this worked out quite well.OUTSTANDING VIDEO, BETTER THAN 'FLIP'For me the true revelation of this camera though was the video. It shoots in 720p HD, no that's not 'true' HD and a 1080p camcorder will certainly shoot better video, but the video is still quite stunning, it will look wonderful on your large HD TV, and outshines the standard 480i DV camcorders of just a few short years ago. When I got back home I edited the movie clips to really sweet results that got lots of compliments. The biggest drawback over a dedicated camcorder is that the sound, while acceptable, is not outstanding and not stereo. However, if you are considering the very popular FLIP MinoHD or FLIP UltraHD this camera is by far the better choice. I bought the Flip Ultra and played with it for awhile but the lack of Image Stabilization made it nearly impossible to shoot any type of video without it being quite jittery-looking unless you used a tripod. The fact that the Canon 960is is a better choice for video and just happens to shoot outstanding stills makes this a no-brainer over any FLIP camera.NICE TOUCHESIn the menu you'll find a setting called 'i-Contrast' which will give you good detail on faces even if they're strongly backlit.  I found this very useful and hardly ever used fill flash.  I kept it on i-Contrast and found the results on all photos pleasing, though if you're going for a dramatic contrast effect you'll want to turn i-Contrast off.This is the 1st Point 'n Shoot I ever used where ISO 1600 produced viewable photos.  Off course there's some grain and some artifacts, but much less than other cameras I've used and in extreme low light you'll get usable stills and movie footage.I generally used P (program) mode as I like to tweak, but the 960 will do quite well left to it's own devices on Auto Mode, which is very good if you DON'T like to tweak.  Auto Mode also automatically knew if I wanted to shoot a close-up and switched to Close Up Mode automatically.The Canon 960 will go from Turned Off to Ready To Shoot in a little under a second.  This was true for Movie Mode as well.  Nice.Battery Life was outstanding.  I would generally take over a hundred pictures a day and shoot several minutes of video and I never felt the need to carry an extra battery.  The battery also charges pretty fast, in a little over an hour.If you explore Program Mode you'll find Long Shutter Mode which was especially good for taking dramatic night vistas.  You'll need to have a small tripod though (like the Flip tripod) as the shutter will remain open for about a second.  However you'll have wonderfully detailed night shots as your ISO can be as low as 80.NO BIG COMPLAINTSContinuous Shooting Mode was just OK, shooting about two frames a second.  After all, it does have 12.1 megapixels to write.  Still, this is the one thing that could stand improvement.Some early reviews complained of the 960is's new menu as difficult to master, but this is no serious drawback. It did take perhaps an extra day for me to get comfortable enough with the menus to quickly adjust a setting, but now it's second nature.I also had read about \"purple fringing\" -- again not a major issue for me as when I compared the pictures to those I shot with my Canon SD1000, the fringing on the SD1000 was far more noticeable and that camera was a former PC Magazine Editor's Choice.

Apparently, this camera is notorious for having this problem.  The Canon repair center initially replied \"Based on our initial examination, we will start the necessary repairs at no charge to you.\".

The service manager I spoke to admitted that the specific defect lens error likely had nothing to do with their possible detection of corrosion, but they will only restore a camera to \"full spec\", not repair a warranty defect.  So, if they can detect any corrosion they can refuse the repair regardless if it has anything to do with the defective part.  I assume they try very hard to find corrosion.It gets even better...

After a quick vacation, I am returning this camera. I am an amateur(at best) photographer.I was able to take some pretty decent pictures, but the majority of the pictures had an issue.Wide Angle - Very nice feature. I'll be getting the SD880 to replace this camera.Red Eye Correction - My wife has blue eyes and always got red eye with our old camera. This is a great feature.Widescreen - Neat at first, until I realized that it was just cropping the max resolution. You could recreate the widescreen effect on the computer by taking pictures at the max resolution and chopping off the bottom 25% of the picture.HD Video - It seemed like it would be great, but I wasn't really impressed. The video on the SD550 was about as good. This seems like a case of the Emperor's new clothes. Knowing that the new camera was supposed to HD, I felt like I needed to say it was much better quality than my old, but I couldn't notice much of a difference. I watched on my new laptop and it played smoothly, but when I tried to watch on my netbook, the video wouldn't play.Shake to change picture - This is a worthless feature. Doesn't work reliably and works when you don't want it to, like when you hand the camera over the camera to show a picture. The scroll wheel was nice in that when you scrolled quickly, the image size reduced and rolled through the pictures very quickly.Auto white balance on face - I would rather not have this feature. It made the skin tones appear all wrong. This is one of the major reasons I am returning. There were many pictures when the camera seemed to get confused and the faces tones were made to be a similar color to the background. For instance, standing in front of a plant made the face look green. Outdoor photos seemed to make the faces bluish. This all occurred with the faces being recognized by the autofocus.Facial Recognition - It was easy to trick the facial recognition. Glasses and hats would easily confuse this feature.Auto ISO setting - It seemed like the camera consistently used a lower ISO setting than was probably necessary. This is likely to introduce a little extra noise in the images.Many blurry pictures - This happened in full day light, low day light, indoor lighting, and with the flash. Most of my SD550's pictures came out less blurry than this camera.Night Scene mode - This is one of the most commonly used Scene modes for us. We used to be able to take photos with us in the foreground and lighted signs in the background and the signs would show up clearly. With the 960, the signs ended up looking like a large blob of light.Flash Settings - It would be nice to force the flash on in the Auto mode. To do this, I had to go to the P scene mode and then I had the option to turn on the flash.I hope that I just had a bad product because I have been a fan of the Powershots for many years and always recommend them.

The day after I ordered it, Amazon sent me an email about the SD980, which was just about to come out.  I would have rather had the SD980.  It is the same size, but it has a 5X zoom, a bigger LCD and a touch screen.  You can see the reviews.  Some people love, but others say there are problems with it.ABOUT THE SD960:I bought it because it has a wide angle lens (28 mm equivelant).  It is great for the pictures I take.  I don't know why everyone is wrapped up in zooms.  Most of the pictures I take are either sight seeing pictures or group pictures.  You need a wide angle lens for that.It also has a panoramic or wide screen mode.  The standard picture aspect ratio is 4:3.  You can put this camera in wide screen mode and get a 9:16 aspect ratio, similar to a wide screen TV.But, the wide screen picture is not 12 MP.  It is something like 10 MP.  To get widescreen, the camera just cuts off the top and bottom of the picture and then widens it. It is similar to digital zoom, in that you can basically do the same thing with your computer.  But, it is convenient to have the camera do it for you.This camera has a ton of features.  The menus are a little different than older Canon models, so that takes getting used to.  I don't like how difficult it is to change between the wide screen and normal aspect ratio modes.  It would be nice if you could do that in one click.I like the picture quality.  I think it is as good or better than any other the other compact Canon cameras I have had.  It takes fairly good pictures at night, unless it is really dark and the object is far away.The LCD is 2.8\", but that is misleading.  Since it is a wide screen, if you are viewing pictures of a normal aspect ratio, the viewable area is only about 2.4\" or less.The only other problem is that in video mode, the zoom doesn't work.  This is an issue with a number of Canon cameras.  I don't know why.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great results even for a novice", "Author": "Garance A.

I buy a new one every 5-6 years, and in the past I haven't been all that thrilled with the results from digital cameras.  I love the convenience, but the picture quality hasn't been great.We were going to have a big family picnic this year, so I spent a full weekend reading every camera review I could track down.  Given the maximum amount I was willing to spend, this PowerShot SD960IS seemed like a good choice.  I ordered mine from BigVALUE Inc here at Amazon (but forgot to leave feedback for them until it was too late, oops!).  I ordered the camera about 2 weeks before the picnic, and happily it arrived in just a few days.Admittedly I still haven't read the instruction manual for most of the features, but I was able to take plenty of pictures at the picnic, and they came out excellent.  I was truly impressed at how nice some of them came out.  I also skimmed through the instructions long enough to figure out how to make a film, and took a film of some fireworks that we had.  That also came out amazingly well, particularly since it's a film of fireworks taken late at night, and I didn't do anything to customize the camera settings.  All the video and sound came through great.At one point in the middle of the picnic I did manage to put the camera into some kind of quirky mode by mistake.  There were icons on the viewer which were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't figure out what.  Needless to say, I didn't waste any time reading the instruction book, but instead just turned the camera off and on to reset all the settings.  I did lose a dozen or so photos that I thought I had taken while the camera was in that quirky mode, but didn't lose the pictures before or after it was in that mode.  Moral of the story: Read the instructions!In my case, I plugged the camera into a MacOS machine, and that worked fine.  iPhoto had no trouble pulling in the pictures and the movie.  I actually filmed the fireworks as a bunch of short clips because I didn't know how long the fireworks would be, or how much I could fit on the flash card that I bought.  I moved all these clips into iMovie, and had no trouble with that step either.  I had bought a Transcend 16-GB class-6 flash card, and it turns out that was PLENTY of room for what I wanted to capture.  With more experience, I wouldn't have been so paranoid about running out of room!In addition to the flash card, I bought a spare battery, and that worked out well.  Much easier to switch batteries in the middle of a picnic, and then let the first one re-charge while taking pictures with the second one.I think the 12.1 megapixels are plenty, although I wish the camera had more than a 4x optical zoom.  The image-stabilization feature must have helped a lot, because I had very few blurred pictures, and the few I did have were pictures of busy situations, with several people moving around in different directions.I am very happy with this camera.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome wide screen hd camera camcorder.", "Author": "Le Mull\u00e9t", "ReviewID": "R1QQVKTDQUJNZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned Casio 750, Kodak v570 23mm, Panasonic Z3 28mm, Samsung 24hd 24mm, Kodak v1253 hd, Vado hd, Canon sd1100.

Now however, it's shown it's true colors and destroyed weeks of memories with one single button click.

All we had to do was bring up the format section of the menu thinking it might be how we change the resolution of taking pictures.  Then, after we quickly realize it's not the right place, we tried to exit the format menu using your wonderfully convenient navigation wheel.  Well, if you click just a little past the option to cancel you end up on the button that says ok!

I have an older 4MP Canon PowerShot SD300 Elph which I purchased 5 years ago and hands down it is a better camera. The SD300's only flaw is that pictures are a bit yellow when taken inside. I'm sorry to say Cannon has not improved that flaw on the SD960. The SD960 takes decent videos and also when it lands a good shot in Auto mode, I am very pleased with the outcome. However, the majority of the time (even in kids and pets mode) photos are very dull in color, most are blurry, and the lag from the time you press the shoot button to the time it takes a picture is insufferable. Face recognition is a nice feature, but with digital I have learned to take more than one shot (which is hard when you wait and wait for this camera to snap a picture). I am hoping that maybe Canon has made a firmware adjustment or something to fix the flaws in this camera. Otherwise, I would consider taking it back and getting something else.

I have a Panasonic that works well, but I tried using the video feature for the first time only a couple of months ago and discovered it doesn't record sound. Also, in trading pictures from a family vacation, I like another family's pictures better than mine.  So we decided to actually spend a decent amount of money to upgrade to a better quality camera that could do video.  This one seemed to have overall good ratings, among the best in the price range of under $400.  So we took the plunge.Why I wanted to love this camera:It is very compact, but not so tiny that it is hard to work with.  It feels very sturdy - almost surprisingly heavy for it's size.  It doesn't feel cheap at all.  The battery seems to last forever.  And the price was right for all the capabilities.Why I can't love this camera:  The picture quality is terrible.My first and biggest complaint is that for some reason, it always picks an incredibly slow shutter speed for the conditions, even when you set it on \"Kids and Pets\".  I did side by side comparisons of my old camera and this one, and outside taking pictures of active kids in the pool on a sunny day, my old camera was picking 1/500, while this camera was picking 1/125.  So the pictures from this camera were all blurry, while the pictures from the other camera were sharp.Second, if you use the \"auto\" setting (there are three top lever choices - auto, picture, and video - chosen by a hard to manipulate selector switch on the top of the camera), the colors come out bizarrely.  If you switch to the \"picture\" setting, you either have to set things manually or you have to choose one of their preset options.  The crazy thing is that although they have settings for \"fireworks\" and \"aquarium\", they don't have a setting for scenery pictures.  The most normal setting there is is \"kids and pets\", so that's what I have to leave the camera on all the time, even as I have been shooting pictures of mountains and trees.Third, the pictures just don't look good.  Even if I take a picture of two stationary kids using the \"kids and pets\" setting, the pictures just don't look natural.  I'm not an expert, but something about them almost looks fake.  And the pictures I have been taking on our vacation in Sequoia National Park have come out generally terribly.  I've been shooting with both my old camera and the new one (as well as taking stills on a video camera) and the pictures from this camera, even when they aren't blurry and the light and color balance is decent, just don't look nearly as nice as the pictures from my old camera.Another gripe, although not nearly as serious as bad picture quality, is how hard it is to switch to the macro setting.  Although it would appear to be accessible from a control wheel (the one that gives access to flash control and the timer), I can't actually select macro unless I have opened up another menu and gone back to the \"P\" setting.  And then after using the macro, I have to reopen the menu and go back to \"kids and pets\" to get decent color on my regular pictures.  On my old camera, \"macro\" was a stop on the main selector wheel.Bottom line:Although we bought this camera to have a handy way to take video and pictures without having to haul the video camera around, I'm giving up on this camera and passing it along to my son, who has been wanting his own camera.  When we realized this camera wasn't going to cut it for video or pictures, we plunked down the bucks for a Panasonic HDC-SD90 video camera, and it turns out it takes great stills (in addition to amazing video) with the click of a button, even while in video mode.  Plus, the stills can be 16:9, which has been helpful taking pictures of sequoias.  So in the end, we'll be using my old camera for everyday, and taking the new video camera around for stills and video in special occasions.

The only major drawbacks were that there is no viewfinder but I can totally live without it, and in certain crappy lighting situations, the pictures have lots of bookah and are noise but the same goes for any point and shoot.

Canon released the SD960IS in the meantime so I bought it thinking HD video will be an added plus. BIG MISTAKE! This camera has a major flaw: face recognition does not work well in 80% of pictures. It only works on less than 6ft if sun hits directly on the face and if the subject does not wear glasses, sunglasses or a hat. If face recognition does not detect the face, it will not meter the exposure correctly thus it will not trigger the flash when needed and/or not focus on the subject and you will end up with dark faces, overexposed pictures and out of focus subjects. Now, I did try to overcome this by using the few manual controls available with not much luck. My 5 yr old Canon S70 is much much better in this respect. It is very interesting that face recognition on a $150 Sony DSC-W220 my girlfriend has performs flawlessly and not just with one subject in the picture but even with 5-6. Now, I would not recommend the Sony for other reasons (no wide angle, very noisy, etc) but come on Canon, you cannot release a $330 (at the time of purchase) camera with such poor facial recognition in 2009. SD880IS wasn't perfect when it comes to facial recognition but unlike the SD960 it worked really well in 90% of cases and that's good enough for me. There are other things that I don't like about the SD960 such as the cumbersome menu (worse than the 880), a tendency to use macro mode in Auto mode when shooting scenery, unable to use the flash in auto mode, etc, but no camera is perfect and I wouldn't consider them a big issue.

Even with rather large hands, the buttons are easily accessible. Since I'm used to Canon, the menus are super easy. I grabbed two 4GB SDHC cards and two extra (generic) batteries, and everything fits in a little Case Logic case (~$6 at Staples). The 4GB cards each hold 20 minutes of DVD-quality (720p) video.

I knew I would use a point and shoot more often. This is one electronics I have purchased that actually went up in price after I owned it (about 9 months now). The research I found showed off an example portrait shot done under a bridge: bright back-light, yet the peole had great lighting (without flash).  Remarkable shot with a compact camera and I would say the computer is compositing the shot. In bright light, this camera's photos are remarkable with auto mode. Shoot indoors with relective light, we have to start fiddling with the options.The camera has 3 modes: video, presets, auto. The presets enhance color or camera speed. I find I had to familiarize myself with the 15 modes. Portrait mode softens the subject's features. I was trying to enhance the reds of my subject, make the shot warmer. Using Sunset mode gave me the results I wanted, but this mode also slows the shutter speed way down. I have to hold the camera super steady. There are other, custom settings but they are buried in the sub-menus. Getting familiar with the camera does take some small effort.I never used any manufacturer's software to download from any of my cameras. I find a USB flashcard convertor to be more versatile on any computer platform. Just connect and I get the image files like having an extra hard drive. The movies are in .mov format (QuickTime) with a mono audio sound track. Windows users will have problems with that and want some kind of convertor software to make .avi. The HD video picture quality is great.For a point and shoot I would rate this camera as a smart choice from the huge selection of cameras to choose from -- modern enough that you won't need to upgrade for a long time.

Thus, I felt that I needed to have a camera strapped to my side 24/7.My serious camera is a Canon S5-IS.  Yes, I know, how serious of a photographer can this guy be if that is his serious camera?  Well, art is in the eye of the beholder and it does not take a pricey camera to come up with excellent quality shots if you are framing properly and using light in the right ways.While I love how easy the S5 has been to use, it is too big to be carrying around everywhere. Thus, I needed something smaller but that would take the same quality pictures.So, I figured that since I like the S5 that Canon must have something smaller with similar features and menus and lo and behold they have a whole line of cameras.  I purchased the Asian equivalent of this model the IXUS 110 IS.  I enjoyed it for two years using it to shoot everything and anything.As I said before, I like having a camera on me at all times, so I usually had this in a small belt case that was originally made for a cell phone.  Unfortunately, while riding in a cab a few weeks ago en route to a friends wedding, I left it in the cab and never saw it again.I was a little heartbroken as it was such a good little camera. So, I decided, hey, I could buy something newer but I wonder if looking on Amazon.com I might find something that was the same, maybe used or refurbished (refurbished is as good as new by the way) and save a little money.There it was, the American equivalent, the SD960 IS, being sold used (barely) and for a great bargain.  I ordered it and had it sent to a friends military box and it arrived in less than ten days time.I am very happy with this new one and will always remember to keep it strapped to my side.For its ease of use, a variety of settings regarding light and color (including black and white and sepia), a decent little flash (which I almost never use) and for its compact size, I highly recommend the SD 960IS.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good solid camera", "Author": "Gregory M.

I immediately had some usage criticisms.  The camera functions are harder to remember as not much is indicated on the camera body buttons and knobs.  The 800 had knobs which showed icons to remind you what they did and get you to the part of the menu you wanted.  I found with the 960 I had to spend a lot of time going through everything (and using the manual to do so) to try and learn all the functions and commit them to memory.  And then unless you are using the camera frequently, you tend to forget where everything is next time around. Things just didn't seem very intuitive or obvious to me for some reason.  I guess the 800 was one of the last models to also include a small viewfinder, which while not at all perfect, was still helpful to see what you are shooting when in bright light.  Trying to shoot the 960 in bright scenes such as snow or beach, I sometimes find it impossible to see anything due to glare on the viewing screen on the back.  I guess this is an unfortunate and unsolved problem with all P&S; cameras at this point in time.  I like having the viewfinder available for certain lighting conditions and I'm sorry cameras no longer include them.  I consider this a real negative for the 960.I find the 960 MUCH harder to hold and I don't have large hands. It's very easy to drop due to its smaller size and smooth, slick, rounded edges.  The 800 was somewhat square, easier to hold.  I always worry about dropping the 960 and have done so quite a few times just getting it out of its case.  I put the wrist strap on it and make sure it's on my wrist all the time just in case it slips out of my  hands.I will say the pictures it takes can be very beautiful, vibrant and sharp.  I turn off the flash about 98% of the time and have taken indoor family photos without flash that turn out really great and natural, perfectly exposed, even when shot in amazingly low light that you would think would produce a dark photo.  Using flash, I could never get rid of the red eye, and things looked harsh.  I don't like flash with this camera.  I've been reading about the Canon S95 and its low light capability, but the 960 is pretty darn good in that regard, impressively so. I actually wonder how much better the S95 could be!You do have to be very careful to let the 960 auto-focus by pushing down the shutter button half way and allowing it to focus.  Once it has focused, you can then press the button all the way down to shoot the photo without much lag time.  I learned the hard way if you compose the photo and then just push the button down quickly without waiting for the auto focus, the photos will mostly be blurry AND there's this lag time that is really annoying, especially if you are shooting things that move a lot like kids or animals.Once you get into the menus, there are actually a lot of choices.  You can change ISO speed, modes such as portrait, beach, snow, night etc., there are color choices such as vivid, film color, sepia, B&W;, and many others.  So if you want to customize things you can really get into it.  Mostly I'm lazy and want to shoot something quickly, so most of the time I end up shooting on automatic, which actually makes very intelligent choices and takes great pictures.  The macro mode is very good, but you need to shut off the flash or the photo looks blown out.  You need to experiment with it, but macro is fun and is much better on the 960 than it was on the 800.The wide angle 28mm is nice to have.  A better zoom would be nice, but it's OK for most things.  I don't like the digital zoom so I never use it.The battery seems to have a long life and it recharges very quickly.  I don't use the HD video much, but for me it is of limited use and the sound isn't all that great.  It's OK for quick videos when taking still photos, it's nice to have available when needed suddenly.  If I were doing a lot of video, I wouldn't use this camera for the video, I'd rather have a true video camera.I've shot a lot of photos with the 960, never a problem yet.  I'm generally happy with it, and certainly one positive is the size because I can always keep it in my purse all the time.  I paid $199 for it, but don't think I'd want to pay more than that as it seems to be higher now for some reason.  Also, I don't think I'd buy it again as it seems like there are better choices out there now, a year later.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier!", "Author": "Jeff Kimble", "ReviewID": "R3K8G0Z8Y1XU0D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before setting out to Europe.  I spent plenty of time comparing and contrasting cheaper point-and-shoots before I finally pulled the trigger on this 960IS.  I've been carrying it around for 4 months now, have had the opportunity to put it through the ringer, and now can provide you fellow Amazoner's with a sufficient review!1) You can't expect point-and-shoots to come out with phenomenal images like those you'd capture with a D-SLR.  It's just not going to happen.  That being said, I have been impressed time and time again with what this camera has been able to pull off.  The resolution is incredible, it handles light well, and has plenty of fun little color balance presets to play around with.2) The flash leaves something to be desired.  It LOVES to take bright pictures of subjects in the foreground and blacken the background.  There is a setting for a slow synchro flash to lighten up the background, just be sure you'll holding the camera steady or using a little tripod.  I prefer to shoot pictures with the flash off, though, and this delivers brilliant night images.  They don't come out grainy at all and are actually quite beautiful.3) My obsession with the ELPH line has always been the aluminum bodies.  This (at least as far as I can tell) is plastic.  For this price, I wanted aluminum.  It's held up extremely well, though, and when combined with a little case, it shouldn't be a problem.3) I didn't think I would ever use the video feature.  But that changed, capturing little snippets to send home of open mic nights, concerts, and other sightseeing adventures.  The video is actually quite good and the audio is better than you'd expect.  Again, it's not pro-level, but it's very impressive.4)  It's quick to start up, making those \"oh hold on, let me get a picture!\" moments easier to catch.  It processes the pictures quickly and is ready to go for the next pic almost immediately.5) I fell in LOVE with the wide-angle lens.  It manages to open up the field of vision more than I thought it would.  There have plenty of times where I wanted to take a landscape picture thinking I'd have to walk backwards 15 ft, only to realize the camera can pull it off.6) The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are because of the lack of metal body and it's sometimes incredibly annoying flash.In all, it's a great, compact little camera that has served me dutifully and shows no signs of giving up.  If you're looking for a new point-and-shoot, I think this is one of the best money can buy.  It's compact, fast, takes great pictures, and is easy to tote around with you.

We bought this camera to capture lots of pix of our newborn and it hasn't disappointed.- Quality pictures in full auto mode- Wide angle lens to capture scenes at close range- Great HD 720p video- Fast focus and startup; minimal lag- Simple controls including turning off the flash; setting the timer- Relatively easy to change to high speed ISO mode- Good quality photos in indoor lighting (including good white balance)- Good quality photos outdoors (bright areas not too bright and shadowy areas not too dark)- Small size fits in a pocket- Sufficient controls to allow some amount of manual adjustmentIn low light it helps to just set it to manual and default to ISO 800 speed.  Pictures are a little noisy if you blow them up, but perfect for viewing on your computer.Really tough to find any serious complaints that would make me not want this as an everyday camera.Easier to use than higher grade models like a Panasonic LX-3, and smaller than a Canon G10/11.Can be delicate as I need to replace my unit after dropping on the wood floor from the kitchen counter, but I think this is a problem with any point and shoot with an extending lens.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A fine choice, but I want more", "Author": "djb", "ReviewID": "RXIC5OEYMBY4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must preface this review by saying that I've been using Canon digital SLRs for the past seven years, so a point and shoot is definitely going to be a step down for me in image quality. I find the Canon to have much better images than the Nikon Coolpix cameras I've bought my teens. I bought this because I wanted a low cost, portable (pocket) high def video camera and I don't like the Flip and similar videos; I wanted a camera that will also take higher quality stills as well, and this seemed like a good mix.Overall, I'm happy with it, but wish it could do more.Pros:* Decent image quality. 12.1 Mpixels means you can crop without losing much image quality. But it is definitely not DSLR quality* 1280x720p HD video. Not full HD, but still decent for the price* video image is sharp and bright (if well lit)* Easy to use; I like the wheel control and the menu operations* Nice, large screen.* Nice solid, quality feel.* Quick picture review without full power up/lens extension (but this is also a Con)* battery life seems OK; I can shoot over 30 minutes HD (1280x720) video on one charge. I bought a couple extra off-brand batteries for \"insurance\". The Canon brand battery is much too expensive to buy a second/third for a full day outing.* Good set of image options (ISO, vivid color video, white balance settings, etc)Cons:* The video is too blurry when using the 4x optical zoom.* Some menu controls are not as easy to use (i.e. while it is easy to quickly delete a picture after taking it if you don't like it, it is much harder to delete a video)* The review button is fully functional when the camera is powered down. That is, if the camera is off, pressing the review button (top right on the back) will start image review. Normally this is OK, as it is a nice ease of use feature, but it also means the camera can be turned on accidentally when its in your pocket. This happened to me and it drained the battery. The camera needs a \"lock\" slide switch to disable all buttons, or a setting/option to disable this feature.* Zoom is not very smooth - it has fixed increments (i.e. 4.0, 3.1, 2.5) which it jumps between.* Cannot zoom while taking video (unless enable digital zoom, which degrades quality too much)* 4x zoom is pretty lame; I had 10x zoom on an Olympus 10 years ago.* slow shutter response, so it is very easy to miss a shot (I've never seen a point and shoot that has fast * shutter response, though some in higher price ranges may have this.)", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good, but Macro needs help.", "Author": "J.

I'm sort of a video fanatic when I travel or visit friends (much to their dismay) and my SD1100IS has always shot great quality videos with amazing sound. This new model definitely shoots superior photos and video due to it's 12.1 mega pixel capacity and I'm pleased with my purchase. However, a few things to note: 1. The SD960IS is slightly bigger and heavier then the SD1100IS. 2. The DS960IS shoots video in only .MOV format (quicktime), which I guess is necessary for HD quality (the camera comes with software that will allow you to export the .mov file to your computer to a .avi file, but you lose quality) 3. The DS960IS does NOT come with the midi HDMI cord and it must be purchased separately (about $45 for a genuine Canon cord) and 4. The only way to enjoy true HD video is to connect the camera to an HDTV via the HDMI cord (watching on your computer is not HD and unless you have a blu-ray burner on your computer, you'll be storing videos on SD cards and using your camera as a player). My only complaint about all of the Canon ELPH cameras I've tried is light streaking; shooting video in bright sunlight, or at night, and you get streaks of lights from major light sources that show up as blue or purple lines in the video. All in all, I'm happy with the SD960IS, and for the price, the ability to shoot HD video is a plus. One last note, the \"wide-angle\" zoom is not like an SLR. The SD960IS starts at 28MM and zooms from there. A nice feature, but I was expecting the ability to wide-angle out from my shots.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cannon Camera", "Author": "D.

Used the camera three days.  Accidently erased 200 pictures on the second day and on the third day of my cruise the camera was stolen out of my stateroom on Norwegian Cruise Line's Jewel ship.  They were going to investigate and let us know what they found or didn't find on the video tapes they were supposed to review of the hallway to our room.  They promised they would thoroughly investigate and report back to us. They never did and didn't seem to care that on our final day on the ship we had to leave without ever knowing what happened to our camera. Needless to say, I'll never take an NCL cruise again, and suggest anyone concerned about the safety of their belongings do not use NCL either.  I am considering re-purchasing this camera if and when I ever get the money again.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.00", "Features": "12.1-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality poster-size prints\n4x optical zoom; 28mm wide-angle lens\nHD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\n2.8-inch widescreen PureColor LCD II screen; Face Detection\nCompatible with SD/SDHC, MMC/MMC Plus/HC MMC Plus (not included)", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SD960IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch LCD (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fw73WB7WL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001SER474"}}
