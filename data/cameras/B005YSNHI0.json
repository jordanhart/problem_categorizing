It's grainy and blurry. While, if you know the person you're looking at, sure. You can tell they're moving around, waving... You can see them walking. But if you don't know who the person is... good luck! And if the lighting is low, well... you can make out their shape moving around. (I'm talking comfortable low lighting.. from a table lamp or two).I ended up with this camera because it was one of the two I was offered. I was told other cameras wouldn't work with the system (which I am also not in love with.. but don't hate either).The camera is stationary. It has a cord. So.. while you may want to be discrete with placement, you can't.. unless you want to hire an electrician to create a new outlet for you. There will be a long cord from your outlet to this camera.It is an okay camera. It isn't worth what I paid for it. It's like an ancient webcam that has been repurposed for video survalence.That being said. Setup was easy. I had to reconnect it to our router when the old one was replaced. All I needed to do was delete the camera and re-add it to the network (by attaching it to the ethranet cord... another irritant). Glad it was easy.. because I didn't want to get connend into buying another camera or sit around waiting for (and paying for) a technician.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "J.

It was very simple to set up also (I didn't even need to call them).  The quality in HD mode from a computer in full screen is excellent as well.  I have 1 neat each entrance into my house. The iPhone app is great too.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005YSNHI0"}}
