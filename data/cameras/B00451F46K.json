{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Recommended", "Author": "FRED \"FJG\"", "ReviewID": "R1B8DVNQTXT3XE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product fails to work as advertised, and with no online support and a manual on CD that does not completely match the software supplied, you are not getting what was advertised.  When installing the software, be sure to not let windows install the drivers or the software won't work at all.  The dvr initialization step will not initialize the boot disk but will initialize another internal, external, or flash disk.  The initialization process does not wipe out the disk but only makes a folder for storing recorded video.  Not all video modes (7 windows, 9 windows, etc) work, but the single window and the 16 window modes work.  At setup, the installation software claimed there was no audio card installed, which is incorrect, I have an audio card, but no audio functions were testable.  Camera resolution modes are CIF, Half D1, and D1: no explanation of what these are in the manual.  Be sure to change the setup so that when you exit the eyeonet software, it doesn't shutdown your computer which is the default setting.  Once the software was running, the motion activated recording would store videos on disk.  When trying to view the recorded videos, however, the software will occasionally spontaneously exit and reboot your computer.  This could have been a great product, but the software needs a lot more work.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Videosecu 16 Channel Home CCTV Security Surveillance System DVR PC PCI Video Capture Card 1B4", "Author": "nubbles", "ReviewID": "R20CHG4RVQAX2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great! Was looking for a cheap version of the eyemax system I have at work. This fits. If you are familiar with eyemax you will have no problem with this. For those who aren't sure, you will want a windows XP machine, 32 bit only. install the card, hit cancel 8 times as windows finds all the hardware and attempts to install drivers, then load whatever software you prefer, eyemax or the clone version that comes with the product, connect your cameras and audio and you'll be up and running. Anyone ordering this and leaving negative reviews due to lack of understanding the product: your alternative is to spend several hundred dollars on the same card/chips from a different manufacturer that will hold your hand and guide you, or a thousand or more on a full system with this installed and configured for you. With a little bit of knowledge $79 is a fantastic price", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "The worst Computer product EVER", "Author": "Dbdata", "ReviewID": "R5FWDMFNYWNSD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Words fail to describe how bad this product is.  The first sign of trouble was when it came with a hand-burned CD-R with a 1 inch by 2 inch printed label.  Not one SHRED of other documentation.The installation went fine UNTIL it got to the point of requesting a file system to FORMAT before it could proceed.  Remember, NO documentation is available just yet.  Format my C drive?  I don't think so.Saying \"NO\" to that input causes a cascade of failures that can't seem to be set right again.Any attempt to address the software causes it to set my screen resolution to one that my monitor doesn't support.Need I go on?The sale of this product is outright theft.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not enough documentation, but not that hard to figure out.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3ISV9EZMXD5YA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Make sure you have a computer with 1 hard drive for OS/applications AND 1 hard drive to store video.That has been my biggest snag with this software. There's no documentation to tell you this beforehand, so I'm telling you now. If you have a PC with 2 hard drives - 1 that you can format for storing video - this software works just fine.I have built and sold 4 DVR systems using this card to the same business and they have requested 4 more for a new building. Obviously they're plenty happy with the product over the past few years.I do make these DVR systems every few months and sometimes forget I need 2 hard drives so that's a pain, but remember this and you'll be fine with this card.Also, as one other reviewer mentioned you MUST use a machine with 32-bit Windows XP.
