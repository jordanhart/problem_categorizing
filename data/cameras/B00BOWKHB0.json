I have shopped around for a while for this camera and this is by far the best deal! Some of the extras that it comes with are a little cheap, like the extra flash. And it also says it comes with an SD card, but actually comes with a micro SD card, so I couldn't eve use my camera until I got the adapter for the micro :(. But overall a great price and a great camera.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good and Hope better next time", "Author": "RMEL", "ReviewID": "R36GI42ZZT7YAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very nice to trade with your side, and I hope to do it again in future, wish you a very good luck", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.99", "Features": "20.3 Mp Image Capture\n20-50mm (2.5x) Zoom Lens\nBright 3.0\" TFT-LCD\nLarge (23.5 x 15.7mm) APS-C Image Sensor\nFull HD 1080p Stereo Video Capture", "Name": "Samsung NX1000 Mirrorless Wi-Fi Digital Camera (White) Kit with 20-50mm Lens & Samsung 50-200mm f/4.0-5.6 ED OIS II Lens.
