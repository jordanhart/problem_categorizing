{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb", "Author": "Thomas Maplewood", "ReviewID": "R1CVBAKL2UEQS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, the cons, since they're most important-XD Picture Card.  This is the biggest thing that irks me, since XD is a dying brand and Olympus refuses to give it up. However, since working with it, i've found nothing really bad about xd, only that it's like sd but just a tiny bit bigger, so don't worry about this.-Doesn't come in orange.  Oh well, I think i'll live with silver (which is very nice by the way)-Has an odd \"favorites mode\" i probably won't use*  *see below for disclaimer-Panorama only works in P mode  Who cares, i take all my pictures in that mode anyway (But it took me a while to learn that)-Low battery  For some odd reason, i get a low battery signal even when i know i've got a couple of hours left. No big deal, i carry an extra battery with me all the time.Uhhh, i truthfully can't think of anything elsePros:-Rugged  This camera is a beast. I don't think you can break it. i saw C-net freeze two of these things in a block of ice and when i was at National Camera Exchange, they literally swept it off the counter and let it crash to the floor. It also feels really sturdy in your hands-Waterproof  What can i say, built in waterproof. Does that mean i don't have to worry about the rain or snow? Yes. Yes it does.-Compact  For all it's ruggedness, this camera is small. Thin, with a lens you don't have to worry about protruding.-Easy to use  Comparing it to some Cannon brands at a store, this camera was WAY easier to use and was a lot faster in selecting modes, types of shots, ect.-Panorama  Has an in camera panorama that is amazingly easy to figure out. First time i tried it, i got exactly the type of shot i wanted, no learning curve. Stitches three pictures together in camera. Perfect for those spectacle nature shots and whatever else you need to capture. (note: Panorama only works with an xd card, and not compatible with the micro sd to xd converter that you get in the box)-LED lamp  Super bright white LED on the front for those really dark shots. You can also turn it on when the camera isn't on, really useful if you need it in a cinch.-Surprising Video  Can take video in 30fps, which came out really good. Option of 15fps as well.-Quick shot view  has a button to press while in camera mode to quickly view shots. When finished, press shutter half way and it zips back to camera mode.-Very, VERY fast  Even when it wasn't pre-focused, the shot time was in under a second. When pre-focused, the speed really was instantaneous. (as in feeling like an SLR speed)-8mp  Excellent image quality. Outshot cannon models in outdoor shots bar none. Indoor, we found cannon did it a little better, but that was digitally zoomed in all the way, comparing it side by side with some hesitation. ergo, it's so small, who cares, and even then the quality was still amazing. But if you're that passionate about perfect pictures, you need an SLR.-3x zoom  Not kidding, a 3x OPTICAL zoom with a lens that doesn't protrude from the camera. Since it's 8mp, i don't think i'll use the zoom, but wow, it really does work.-Fast startup  With no external lens to push out, startup time is blazingly fast.-Favorites  If you set a picture in your favorites, it can never be erased from the camera (unless removed from favorites) even when formatting internal memory as well. Plus, you can set one of these pictures to your menu background, which is a nice touch.What else can i say, this camera really took me by surprise. It has everything i could want in a camera, plus it's amazing durability. Great buy, suggest getting one of the packs that Amazon offers if you want a really good price. If you want to see it, compare it, hold it, test it, whatever, i suggest heading over to National Camera Exchange. They should have it, and they really know they're stuff.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Patricio Chervin \"Patrick\"", "ReviewID": "R1J43B09KDEN77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So i purchased this camera to take with me on my trip to cancun where im planning on doing some snorkeling, although i still have not taken the camera on the trip i have already used it and know what its capable of. The camera has the BEST image stabalizer and anti-blurr system i have ever seen, my brother took the camera to a nascar race and took a picture of a car going over 175mph right infront of him and there was no blurr. It has a great macro setting to take close up pictures, i took a picture of a quarter on my desk from about 1 1/2 inches away and it looked amazing, same with a picture of a flower (the built in LED bulb for macro shots helps a lot!). The VGA with 30fps only takes 10 seconds of video which sucks, but it u do VGA with 15fps (frames per second) you can do up to 30 minutes, and i could not tell a difference between the two when i uploaded two similar videos i shot to test it. The camera takes great pictures, and the 20+ shot modes help out sooo much. (candle lit mode for that special night, sunset mode, fireworks mode, underwater wide and 2 other underwater modes, night mode, portait, everything u can think of.)I tested it under water at my local pool and it works great, very fine underwater pictures, the lens has a metal lens cover that closes when u turn off the camera and its very durable (ex. when my dog grabbed it from my hand and ran off with it) nothing but a few minor scratches.  sorry for the long review but i wish i had a long one when i bought it, would have helped me make a decision much faster.  Camera only goes 10ft so the underwater case is a must if you are going scubadiving, i will at the end of march and ill update the review to let u know how that is. Hope this helps, all in all, this is a great camera!", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for older kids!", "Author": "gcfd", "ReviewID": "R6AY63ZQU63DO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for an 'unbreakable' camera for my hopelessly clumsy 10 year old who begged me for one as a birthday gift.  Considering that my dad trusted me with an SLR when I was 10, I decided to give her a chance too - but with precaution.  I've read many reviews that the picture quality of the Olympus 850 SW was not so great - and that's true if you're so used to Canon and Nikon (we have both in point and shoot and dSLR).However, the greatest features of this camera are it's capability to take shots under water and it's being shockproof (6-ft drop).  Taking shots in rain, snow, or other wet conditions - as well as wild conditions - is worry-free.  If the picture quality is not as important as HAVING pictures on those occasions, then using this camera is a no brainer.  The 24-scene modes, framing, labeling, shadow fix, etc. are just bonuses in my opinion - though my daughter loves experimenting with them.  It does not offer much in the way of manual control, but I guess that's the point of a point-and-shoot.She's taken it swimming many times now and it always amazes me to see our own smiling faces under water!  Maybe the pictures are less vivid than I would have hoped - but for that, I would have to buy an underwater case for my Nikon D80 - and spend twice the cost of my original camera :)  So until I'm an avid underwater photographer, I can settle for my daughter's Olympus 850 SW.I must add though, that the battery life is quite mediocre.  It must be charged after only less than a hundred shots in VGA mode.  Opt to get a second battery.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "olympus camera", "Author": "Valerie A.

They must be ultra sharp with good color balance. I am usually a Nikon and Canon brands fan. I purchased a Olympus high end point and shoot twenty years ago on advice of a good friend motorcycle rider. Hated that camera! Prints were fuzzy, color was terrible. Still have it, like new and in the box. So, this fathers day I opened my present from my wife and guess what a Olympus 850SW. I thought, oh no. I presently own a Nikon 4600 subcompact which takes substandard photos, a Canon Powershot SD 1000 which takes good but not great photos and Nikon D40X SLR which takes great photos. We had a weekend outing with the grandkids. A good time to try out this Olympus thing. Well, I was very pleased. After taking about one hundred pics. The picture quality is very close to my Nikon digital SLR. Lag is almost none. It beats the Canon SD 1000 and the Nikon 4600 very badly. I am very impressed with this little camera. I haven't tried the movie mode because I hardly ever take movies with a digital camera. I have a movie camera for that purpose. I will be going to Hawaii soon and will test the underwater part of this camera.Will keep you posted. Anyway, very pleased and would recommend it very highly.

I use both pro and point and shoot cameras depending on where I am and what I am shooting. I recently purchased this camera as a go anywhere camera and tried it out on a trip to bermuda after reading all of the great reviews. I should have taken a back up camera. First the battery lasts about 10 minutes of shooting time. (about 50-110 shots depending on the flash) It is lower if you try to use the video mode. I would say faulty battery but several other people have told me it is just the battery, buy a spare. The lens is about the worst on the market. It has a really bad curve to it and has a hard time focusing if the subject is 30+ feet away. The antishake is great ....except for the fact that the picture is too grainy to be of any use. I was really excited about the underwater feature..... unless you are in a clear pool with no movement forget it.

It also goes with me when deployed and field exercises with the Army.Other than dropping it, I have put it through its paces and it continues to take quality photos.  The stabilization feature works well for photos in daylight but longer exposures have noticable shake.  The pictures are crisp, telephoto is more than adequate and basic macro photo is possible with this camera.  It is lightweight and slim enough to be a truly portable, go anywhere camera.  It really is waterproof and produces very good (but not excellent) underwater shots. The quality of photos surpasses my expectations of a point and click digital and captures plenty of detail for memorable photos.  For the price, I don't think there is a better camera on the market with these features.The only point against this camera is the battery.  It does not last long enough and if you put it in backwards or upside down it will get stuck and be nearly impossible to remove (see other reviews and their own manual).

It fits into my little wristlet so I know that I can walk around these parks without a bulky purse.  I used it to our recent trip to an aquarium and the pictures taken inside without the flash were pretty good.  It was dark in some areas, so those pics were a little blurry but I still need practice with the camera and all of its features.

The Stylus 850 SW is WONDERFUL!  It lives up to every expectation I had of it so far, and is still suprising me.  Some people have been saying the picture can be grainy and yes, it can be... if you have it on some strangely high ISO setting inside for no real reason!  This camera comes with all the presets you could ever want, including settings for candlelight, behind glass, online auctions, regular portraits, self-portraits, food, AND fireworks!  The 'favorites' menu is genius; ever want to show someone a picture you took and you have to go through all 286 vacation photos to find that ONE picture? No more! With 'favorites,' you can set pictures that you have taken as a favorite, and then when you want to get directly to them, simply turn the selector wheel to the star ('favorites') and all your favorite pictures are in one place, no searching required.  There is even editing available right on the camera so you don't have to wait to get home to take out the red eye or shadows in that great shot of Aunt Martha.  With the fun 'frame' edit, you can even put her newly red eye free picture in a 'frame,' right on your camera!  Then just hook it up to a printer at a local computer place and voila!  Great for the accident prone short person such as myself.  Being 5'4\", I'm probably not going to drop the camera from more than 5', which just happens to be what it is rated for so this is a match made in heaven.  Simply simple, simply AMAZING!The Bad:- Some reviews have stated that if you do happen to take this camera on an underwater adventure, to be sure and keep a good hold on it because it sinks like a lead weight.  I can see why.  Not the lightest camera ever made.  Lighter than my 3mp Olympus from the dinosaur age by a number of pounds, but they make the floating strap for a reason.- I'm a little saddened by the battery situation.  Every time you need to charge it, you have to take it out of the camera, which makes you reset the date and time every time you put the battery back in.  Not a huge issue, just may get a little annoying after awhile.  Plus, repetitive removal of the battery could lead to dust or other particles getting in the battery door, making the waterproof function, well, MAL-function.  Just be very careful, read the directions and follow them to a T.- Didn't come with a screen protector.  Traditional screen protectors aren't waterproof, so I'm wondering how expensive its going to get to buy screen protectors for this camera...  It isn't a big deal since the camera is waterproof so you can just wash off anything icky that may get on it, but it would be nice for scratches and such.  They do make silicon protectors for the outside of the camera that fit it like a glove, which is great for protecting the body.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Waterproof, but only for a while", "Author": "David Ashinghurst \"The Renovator\"", "ReviewID": "R3M2U8N35GZJ8N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I took my son on a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon.  Two days before we left, my wife gave me this camera as a b-day gift.  (I'm usually a Canon type of guy).  The camera worked great for the first 4.5 days, until I went swimming with it in Havasu Falls.  The camera remained at least a foot from the surface, nor did I leave it underwater for more than a few minutes.  Later that evening, as we were setting up camp, I pulled it out to take a pic of a scorpion.  The image on the LCD was a complete fog (when I returned home, the pic was also a fog.)  It took several days until the LCD showed a clear image.  Now I'm hesitant to use it for what it was intended for, and the camera store that my wife bought it at has a 10 day return policy, and it's been longer than that, so I might, or might not, be able to return it.All other functions worked well.I was able to take over 300 pics and 3 minutes of video on the fully charged Li-ion battery.

It's not particularly tiny or lightweight.  But today I took VGA res 30 fps movies of my son and I going down the water-slide together at the waterpark! All the way down! Last week I took shots of my buddy and me surf-fishing in the gulf.  I let my 5 year-old son have it whenever he wants.

The camera comes with an adapter for micro-SD cards, but 30 fps VGA movies are limited to 10 seconds with this memory.2. The USB connector on the camera is a non-standard one I've never seen before.  Don't lose that cable!

We bought this to replace a Casio Exilim that my wife dropped/broke on a girls nite out.  All my old digital cams have eventually broken through the hands of my two kids or wife.  So this time I thought, I need to be realistic up front and buy some kind of tank-of-a-camera that (like me) can withstand the abuse from my family members.  I also like for my cameras to be small size so they are easy to bring along in pants pockets (more photo opps).  So, there doesn't seem to be alot of digital cameras focused on shock-proof features which led me to purchase the 850SW.We've all used the camera over the past three months (including my 6-year old son) and here is my opinion so far:My Pros: - Durability. Shockproof/ Waterproof.  My family hasn't broken this camera yet.  This was my #1 required feature. - Small Size.  This was my #2 required feature.  The best cameras are the ones you have on you. - Picture Quality.  So far I think the pictures we have taken with this cam are decent quality.  Except, I do seem to get more than usual red-eye shots from this cam.My Cons: - Battery Charging.  Terrible process.  Battery must be taken out of the camera and put into a bulky charger that comes with the camera.  Then put back in the camera...my wife really complains to me about this (especially when she jams the battery back in facing the wrong way).  My Casio Exilim was way better in this area where you never take the batter out and just put the whole camera in the cradle. - Battery Life.  I think this is the worst battery life I have had for any digital camera I have owned.  I seem to only get about 30 pics on a full charge, even with an second battery I bought with higher capacity.  My last Casio Exilim battery lasted for days and days.  My wife complains alot about this new camera battery, especially since she is able to reference it versus the last Exilim.  Now magnify this issue with con #1 (taking the battery out to recharge). - Uncommon Memory Card.  I don't have any other xD cards so I had to buy a high capacity one just for this cam (and they are not as cheap as commodity memory cards).  Although in hindsight, this 850SW did come with a micoSD card converter so I should have used this (but ordered the xD card at same time as cam so I didn't know until it was too late).  Also, unusual memory card type means finding card readers is a hassle. - Picture results.  Too much red-eye.My Overall Score: 3 out of 5 stars.I give the durability feature 5 stars.  I give the other camera \"cons\" I mentioned above 1 star.  I average it out to a total of 3 stars.  My old Casio Exilim was better in every way except durability.  I'm really surprised that this 850SW still has these usability problems after so many model generations.  In the future if this is still the only good durable digital camera product line then I would buy it again, otherwise next time I will be on the lookout for other options.I hope you found this review helpful.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for tough environments", "Author": "Keith Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2LZI1Z2YP8LCU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for hiking and canyoneering.

Unfortunately after just a few short days it has failed on all fronts.A cursory look of the specs for this model would definitely have disqualified it had it not been for the purported ruggedness. $300 is overpriced, 8mp is at the back of the pack for resolution, XD memory is odd ball and expensive, no viewfinder, small screen, counter intuitive menus and settings, ect, ect.But it was built to last. Said so right on the box...So I bought one on my way to the airport for a quick trip to Kauai last week. Here is were I have a few positive things to say. Despite the smallish screen and lack of customization it did take some decent shots. They all needed color correction and a few erred on the hot side but overall image quality was acceptable for a point and shoot. A comparably priced Cannon or Sony camera would probably have taken better shots but not bad.Implicitly following the directions to insure water tightness I got more comfortable with the camera. Day one babied it, day two had it in my pocket near the water, day three took a few pictures of shore from the water, and by day four I was sipping a Pina Colada in the pool with my new best friend strapped to my wrist. All was well obligatory Jaws videos were being filmed, a killer sunset picture was shot from underwater. I was happy with my stunted but tough camera...Then it failed entirely.Even after my anal following of the simple instructions it allowed water in and destroyed the camera completely. I was swimming in a pool which should be considered normal use in my opinion.The store I bought it from won't take it back, stating that even though it says waterproof on the front water damage is not a product defect.

If all I cared about was the quality of still shots (what Olympus told me they were focusing on), I would have bought something other than this \"do everything camera.\"My cheap Cybershot that I got 4 years ago will do VGA for as long as I have memory space.  Too bad, because I was really looking forward to this new Olympus, but now it has to go back.

After a lot of shaking (thanks shock protection) I couldn't get it out!

I know I was dumb for putting it in wrong, but come on, Olympus can anticipate that most of us feel confident enough to put the battery in w/o the owners manual. And that most of us will assume if put in incorrectly it will come back out.  I call olympus. They tell me I can mail it to a service center in CA or NY (I live in Chicago) and that I'd get it back in a mere 7-10 business days. All this for a battery put in upside down? Instead of crying or throwing the camera against a wall (which I really wanted to do) I decided to try using some tweezers to get kinda pry it out. Whaddya know, worked right away, didn't damage anything. Thank god! I was close to tossing it in a fit of rage and vowing to never buy olympus again.  I consider this to be a huge design flaw.

For a novice photographer it was very simple to use and took surprisingly good underwater pictures while snorkeling.  However, on day three of the vacation, while snorkeling, the screen on the back of the camera went off and would not come back on.  I was still able to take pictures, but I could not see what I was taking since the screen is the only viewfinder on the camera.  I had kept the camera around my wrist while snorkeling and never took it down more than 6-7 feet (rated for 10 feet).  It dried out that night and the screen began to work again, however, when we went snorkeling the next day, the same thing happened to the screen.  I opened the usb port after I got out of the water and had dried the camera off and it appeared that some water had gotten through the rubber lining.  Needless to say, I was displeased, as I bought this camera mainly for the underwater/waterproof functionality.  I would warn others to be careful before purchasing this product if you plan on using it underwater extensively.  If you are buying it solely for the underwater capabilities, you might take a look at the more expensive 1030 that is rated for a greater depth.  I can only assume that water somehow got through one of the two seals and was interfering with the connections that power the screen.Were it not for the fact that the camera's screen went out on me, I would have been very pleased with this product.  It took great outdoor photographs, I was able to get a nice collection of scenery photographs and never had to worry about how the salt spray from the ocean would effect the camera, as I could just dunk it in the sink to wash it off later that day.  I also got quite a few really nice underwater photos (the flash is helpful, even though the underwater scene presets don't usually use it).  I found that the image stabilization setting really helped underwater, especially in the ocean, as the waves tend to move you around just when the perfect picture opportunity presents itself.  Before purchasing, please take a look at your other options if you plan on using this camera for a lot of underwater photography.

I bought it right before a trip to Hawaii and took some (300+ in all) really great pictures!  It is easy to use and takes beautiful pictures.  I love that it can go under water - the main reason I bought it.  It does take better pictures in the pool than in the ocean, but I just ended up taking lots of pictures at the pool!  I now have a video of my daughter (who swims like a fish) swimming under water!  That alone is worth the price of the camera for me.  There is no way I could ever capture that!  The still pictures, above and below the surface, are great too!  The battery lasted long enough.  It did run out but only after taking lots of pictures.  I did recharge the battery every night.  But that's no big deal.  Also, the battery should only be put in one way, but as long as you are careful and look at both the camera and the battery, you shouldn't have a problem putting it in wrong.  Just be careful I read someone put it in wrong and had a hard time getting it back out.  The only drawbakc to this camera, although not a big one, is that the XD card does not fit in either my 4 year old desktop or my brand new laptop computer.  You have to connect via the USB port and download directly from the camera, again, if it takes a long time the battery life can be an issue.All in all, I still feel it is the most fun camera I have ever owned!

Camera menus are in my opinion easy to navigate, and the manual features are nice.  For inexperienced photographers the stylus has a mannual setting for almost any situation.  Of course the auto setting does very well too.CON's: The video feature on this camera is poor.  The picture quality of the video is good, but the sound is poor, and you can only film for 10 seconds at a time.  I didn't buy the camera for video, I already have a nice compact HD video camera (Canon HG-10) that meets my needs.Other Thoughts: The camera takes fantastic underwater pictures, and I am very impressed with what this little camera can do.  However, be aware that when you take pics underwater, water or dirt/film can get in between the lens and the lens cover.  This will cause some blurring of your pictures.  Be sure and clean the internal lens from time to time to ensure the clearest pictures.I have owned and used several DSLR's.  For the money, this is about the best and most versatile camera I have ever had.

I wanted it in September because I would be going to a few New Kids on the Block concerts (Don't knock 20 year love!) and really wanted a good camera I could take to the shows to take photos and video.I received the camera on September 4, 2008.  The color is BEAUTIFUL.  The camera was so light.  It was fantastic.  So I took the battery out and I took the camera out and I went to put the battery in.Mind you, I did not look at the directions because who really needs to look at the directions to put in a battery!?So I try to put the battery in, it wouldn't fit.  So I turn it around.  Still won't fit.  So I turn it another way and the battery slides right in.I close the door, but the battery door won't close.  Hrm.  maybe I put the battery in wrong?  Wait? Why won't the battery come out!?I get out the directions and lo and behold there's a big X indicating how NOT to put the battery in and a little note that says \"If you put the battery in the wrong way, you will not be able to get it out\".I had my camera for 5 minutes and I had to send it immediately to the shop to get it fixed.  I had to spend my own money to ship it UPS (about $10) on September 5th but fortunately it was covered under warranty and I got it back on September 17th.Maybe I am the only person out there who would figure that if a battery slides in easily, it means it's the right way... and figures that batteries won't fit in the wrong way.  But I think the fact that, if you put a battery in WRONG and it won't come back out unless you send it to the shop, is absolutely ridiculous.Aside from that, I have had no issues with the camera.  Except the battery does say it's low when it's really nowhere near being low.Basically, I'm just giving you a fair warning that if you're an idiot like me, make sure you put the battery in the right way :)", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "ITS A GREAT CAMRA!!!", "Author": "W.

Put it down the neck of your wetsuit and paddle out worry free, or in the outer pocket of your ski jacket on a cold powder day, or snap some pics then toss it on the floor of the raft-This camera has so far stood up to all the abuse I can put it through.Picture Quality:  Takes great pictures, really amazing outdoor pics and really good indoor pics.  Panorama picture quality is not as good but certainly not too bad.  Auto function seems like it takes great pictures, but having all the different shooting modes is fun to play with-(again, Auto takes pictures in the right mode anyway it seems).  Awesome underwater pictures as long as there is some light on the scene.  Not real good underwater pics if the sun is down, or if you shoot in the shadow of the river bank.  The little LED light may help that, but I'm yet to try.Video seems to be good- the sound is a little low.  Could be a little disappointing if you're a real video snob.X-D card- I haven't had a problem with this, even though I though I would.  Doesn't seem like a reason to shun this camera.  2 GB card has been plenty of room for tons of pictures, and loads of about 10 second videos.Battery life:  Hasn't been an issue.  Low battery indicator seems to come on a bit early, but even when the low battery indicator comes on there's still a lot of juice left.Other good points:Great to have a lens cover that retracts automaticallyFast!  Hardly any lag time with the shutter buttonScreen is bright and easy to see even in the sunIt just feels tough-like it won't break (and it won't) if you drop it.A bit of advice:Get a clear cover for the LCD screen.  Mine got a little scratched up after a bunch of rides being in my bike shorts pocket with some grit.  Or store it in a little sac or case, although just whipping it out of your pocket to take a quick picture is nice.Examining the gaskets just prior to entering the water and blowing off any sand that may have gotten in there is a good idea.Get a bright color camera so you can find it on the floor of the raft, or river bed.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Take it for a swim or drop it on a rock... it'll still work!", "Author": "CandysRaves (and Rants) \"CandysRaves\"", "ReviewID": "RLUZPL1EK52OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this camera a year or more agao as a replacement for a previous Olympus SW we misplaced.

Of course I would have loved to get the more expensive version of this camera, but it was too far out of my price range.I had bought a blue version of the 850 a few months back for my mom (when they came out with the newer version).

This pink one will now be hers and I'll be taking the blue one.Even though I'll have to buy an xD card (all my other cameras have SD) I still couldn't see myself buying the less expensive Fuji. The pros of the Olympus outweighed that of the Fuji.I love the macro options with the little LED to help light up a subject. I've always found that a flash overexposes any macro shot and the LED gives you light without blowing a picture out.The Fuji and Olympus are both waterproof, but the Olympus is shockproof. A major plus if you use it in water and have slippery hands when exiting a pool.This past weekend I tested the camera out in a coy pond using the video setting. It took some awesome clips of all the fish swimming around. I have yet to try it out in our pool, but I am anxious to experiment :D8mp is also quite enough for point & shoot pictures. The Fuji has 10mp, but what's 2 more mp when the human eye only really sees at 3? Besides, anything I take with this camera isn't going to be printed out much larger than an 8x10...a 3mp camera even prints up a nice 8x10.I still have yet to use many of the scene settings on this camera and using such things as the in-camera red-eye removal program.Overall this is a great little point & shoot with style and versatility.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "great little camera!", "Author": "Sarah A.

I am very pleased with its performance.I already had a couple of xD cards from an old Olympus camera, and I was able to get a 1G card at WalMart for pretty cheap, so don't worry about availability of the card.  After reading some negative reviews about this camera not being truly waterproof, I decided to take \"dry land\" photos with one card, and then change the card for \"wet\" photos, so I wouldn't lose all my pictures if the camera decided to stop working.The camera has a neat setting (not the default, so you should check the manual) whereby the photos are numbered sequentially as you take them even if you change the card (rather than starting the numbers over again).  This helps you to keep your photos chronological after downloading into your computer even if you switch cards several times in one day.I took several underwater photos in the pool, which turned out really nicely. I was very pleased, as this is the first time I have ever had a waterproof camera.  At the beach, I was still leery of using it under the salt water, but I did use it to take swimming shots above the surface.Several hours after taking the underwater pool shots, back in the hotel room, I removed the battery to charge it and it was wet!!!  There were droplets of water inside the battery compartment as well as on the battery itself!  I dried everything thoroughly and left the compartment open to air dry overnight.  Everything still worked the next day, but I was pretty freaked out about water getting in.  So you should check right away after the camera's been underwater to make sure there wasn't leakage.  My battery was sitting there wet all day and I didn't know it.  I've used it for several days since, but not underwater.  I just hope this doesn't affect future performance.Read the other reviews about the battery.  You have to be careful which way you insert it.  Also, it does show the low battery light even when the battery is newly charged.  Just turn it off and back on, and the battery light will be green again.  This was a problem in my old Olympus camera too.  Battery life is not that bad.  I only had to charge it once in 6 days.It seems that you need an Olumpus M+ 1G or higher card to get a long video.  It's worth it.  I like taking videos.  My biggest beef with this camera is that you need to press the button twice before the video starts recording.  I only need to press it once on my other camera.  I missed some good action because I neglected to press twice.Overall I am extremely satisfied with the picture quality.  A lot of time the quality of the photo depends on the skills of the photographer as well as the resolution setting.  Don't blame this camera if your photos are blurry or dark.My favorite thing about this camera is the cheery yellow color.

If you are just looking for a pocket size camera for general use, there are better options.  But if you are looking for a waterproof camera for water sports (kayaking, canoeing, snorkling, etc) this camera can take some pretty impressive pictures.  Its scene mode offers a vast array of options, including 3 underwater options.  I had it down to 10' repeatedly and in the water for hours during a recent Caribbean cruise.  No leaks.  You will however need to turn the monitor brightness to max in the sunlight and even then I found the monitor unuseable underwater.  You just can't see it through your mask.  That said, it didn't stop me from taking some great pictures.  Just extend your arms out, point and shoot.  Relatives were all impressed with the pictures I took.  For its intended purpose, this camera works great.  I highly recommend the floating arm band option.

I have a lot of outdoor hobbies that make choosing an appropriate camera really tricky: snowboarding, endurance cycling, hiking and camping.  I wanted a camera that I didn't have to worry about in any of those situations.And, for those situations, it's awesome.  As good quality as my Nikon point-and-shoots for outdoor shots.  Completely tough.  I've taken it swimming in mountain lakes, sledding, and carried it for hundreds of miles of sweaty cycling.This is not an indoor camera, though.  Low light shots are often grainy, and I haven't had good luck with either the macro mode or image stab features.  I still get acceptable pictures, but we end up using the indoor stills from my wife's Pentax instead of this one.Heading to Cancun in June - the camera comes with me.  Snorkleing, here I come!

I've had a lot of small, pocketable, digital cameras over the years but this is easily the best built of the lot. It doesn't feel like a toy or a gadget. Olympus was right to rename the series \"tough\", not that I tested the claims other than to take it outside on a cold day.The lens and image quality are fine for prints. Pixel peepers will find flaws but the camera wasn't intended for the gallery or pro crowd. It's a real people, real use camera. Most folks email images, toss them online, print a 4x6, or maybe an 8x10, and for that it does what it does well.Yes, XD cards are a dinosaur and they're slowly fading away. Fortunately, this camera also uses MicroSD cards. You give up panorama mode and long movie recording. In all my years I've never shot a panorama or a movie with a pocket camera. I have far better cameras for that. With a 1000+ pictures on a 4gb MicroSD card I can live with the trade off.There's been some chatter about battery life. I don't have the problem. Yes, after a bunch of flash shots the battery indicator would flash a bit. Then it stop's flashing and all is well. My guess is the battery level indicator is a bit overzealous and the battery take a bit of time to recover after heavy use. I've seen this before on other cameras.Probably the only negative is the battery charger. It's a big, slow thing with an insanely long cord. The whole thing is bigger than the camera. Swap the cord for an Apple \"duck head\" (used on their laptop power supplies) and the charger is a lot more compact (but not any faster). A note of caution about batteries: there are many 3rd party batteries out there for this camera - many have less capacity than the Olympus battery.Overall, a very nice, practical, take it anywhere camera.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "you can do better", "Author": "Madalily", "ReviewID": "R3GMEC2LJ7OAU9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I agree with the review \"had high hopes\" on mostly everything.

The Olympus does take nicer pictures, but overall, I prefer the Nikon for its features.

The Olympus battery is great, lasts for a few days at a time, the extra battery, however, only lasts for maybe 20 shots- totally not the bargain I had hoped for.

Last time I was on a trip to the beach, my husband and I couldn't both swim at the same time, or we were risking losing our camera.  Or, we just couldn't bring it.  Well, not any more.  We brought this to the beach, swam with it, threw it in the sand, washed it off, and it is still ticking.  It has some great features (an alarm clock with snooze that works when the camera is off was really helpful on vacation- one less thing to pack).  I was sometimes annoyed with the scene function as it is a bit tricky to switch between settings.  Also, the screen is not visible underwater (could be the light we were in).  I still got a lot of good shots, but also lost many because i didn't have it focused right.  Overall, a great, rugged camera, though it isn't perfect.  I bought the xd m+ cards, and the panorama function DOES NOT WORK to stitch the pictures together in the camera. Once i put the pics on my computer, the program did it fine, but I spent a lot of time trying to get it to work on the camera, and it just doesn't.So, if you are not a professional photographer but want a good all around camera to have pictures you can show off- this is a good one.

Titus", "ReviewID": "R9QYGMNQ9SW9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We wanted a camera that was waterproof and shock resistant, primarily for backpacking and canoeing.  We took the camera on a 7 day backpacking trip to Isle Royale in early June and it performed very well.  It is a battery hog, tho.  A second battery was a necessity.  We used it in pouring rain with no problems and it survived the week bouncing in my pack and cargo pocket just fine.  Since then I've held it underwater taking pictures of fish as they were coming to the net, again, no problems.  Cons:  battery life, lack of manual control over shutter speed/aperture, settings options default to original on power down.  For the price, tho, it is a good point and shoot that is also waterproof and shock resistant.2012 update:  had this camera for four years now with no problems.  We've used it extensively while hiking in Alaska, the Tetons, Rocky Mtns NP, Glacier NP and canoeing in Canada:  no issues other than the markings on the function selector have become worn thru use.  The newer versions have been improved (more megapixels, HD video), but ours still takes great pictures.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "jvegeta", "ReviewID": "R1QZN8IO891SEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, got this camera last week. So far, so good. I'm happy with my purchase.Pros:1 - Waterproof, freezeproof and shockproof. Although, I'm still reluctant in trying to freeze or drop it (hey, the camera is brand new, ok?). I'll try those camera features later when I accidentally drop or use this in snow. I'm really really excited to take this to the beach. You will also enjoy watching people's reaction as you wash this under a faucet, hehe.2 - Looks stylish. I was originally going to get the 1030SW, but for me, that model looked ugly. Yeah it has more megapixels, it can go deeper underwater, crushproof,... basically, just better features. But like I said, I didn't like the style of the 1030. It looks too utilitarian. Personal choice my friend.3 - Large and bright LCD screen. I haven't tried testing the battery life under normal use. I have a habit of always carrying a spare battery.4 - The scene option is awesome. Lots of options there.Cons:1 - The camera menu system is not as intuitive. Actually, that is a problem with all digital cameras I've seen, not just Olympus. I have yet to see a menu system that is intuitive. But anyway, I digress.... The 850SW menu system takes some patience to know where and how to use every option/features. I actually called Olympus tech support cause I could not get the panorama*** option to work even though I have an Olympus brand Type M+ xD card (panorama icon was disabled in the main menu). Turns out, the camera has to be set to PROGRAM AUTO as oppose to the default AUTO. For those getting this camera, that will be useful info, and it will save you time digging through the manual (which by the way does not mention this info).2 - The sound is hard to hear when watching a video on the camera. I've read people say the video quality is not great. Well to me, it's really not a big deal, if you really want quality video playback/recording, you should not be doing that on a digital camera.***panorama feature only works if you have an Olympus brand Type M xD card. Actually, they also came out with a newer (and more expensive) card called Type M+. According to them, it is faster then the M version. Using the M+ version, you can take videos longer than 10 seconds at 30 fps (M version is limited to 10 sec at 30fps).", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Worst Camera Ever?

I decided to purchase this camera because I have a 2 year old daughter, and thought it would be safe, since it is so durable. I don't scuba dive or anything like that, just thought it would be fun to play with in the water. I am not a professional photographer but I do like to take nice pictures. This camera is just plain awful and I'll tell you why....Well, let me start out with the pros:1. Tthe beautiful blue color2. Of course, it does go underwater.Now for the cons:1. The photo quality is decent, at best. The photos are grainy, and blurry in most settings.2. It might as well not have a video function. They are the worst videos ever. The sound is almost not even there. This was important to me, even though I have a video camera, because this is the camera I always carry, so it is the one available in the moment when I need it.3. The software that comes with it almost crashed my computer. My computer shut down and went into some sort of DOS/Safe mode, despite reinstalling the software about 10 times.4. The vertical photos don't rotate automatically when they are transfered to the computer. I had to go in and manually change each vertical photo.5. The software is awful. It makes you put the pictures in some weird file, and is overall just worthless. It also doesn't sort out the videos from the pictures, it just mixes them all together and makes it difficult to find stuff later.6. You can't put a date stamp on the photos. (Might not matter to some, but is important to me)7. The camera, while fairly easy to use, is not set up well. There are so many different options and settings, but they are all in different places, some within other options... it is a big mess.8. Some of the functions in the camera are not available unless you use an Olympus memory card. (Which of course, I did not know when I bought a different brand)Now maybe I am just spoiled because I have had a Canon for so long, and they are the best cameras out there, but I expect certain qualities in a camera. For having 8MP, this camera has the photo quality of, MAYBE, a 4MP. It is a pretty camera, and I tried hard to like it, but it is just terrible. I returned it and purcahsed a Canon 790 for about $[...] more and could not be happier. Or course, it doesn't go underwater, but oh well. I can buy an underwater disposable for $[...] if I ever need it.THE MORAL OF THE STORY: DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.

At 8MP, the pictures should look as good as they do from my Canon 20D SLR.

Since there is no view finder, if you need reading glasses, it is difficult to adjust the photo size with zoom.  You need to take a wider picture and crop. The camera let you crop... but you cannot save the cropped photo!  The camera records the date and time...  But you cannot date stamp the photo!  Things that any old average digital camera does!There are special functions with nice displayed illustrations to select that do not work, like a displayed marathon runner function to select for photographing fast moving objects.  It didn't work.  The photos of moving objects are blurred and you need to press the shutter button a few seconds in advance and pray that the object would be in the frame when the shutter open.  If you try to photo a moving car, horse or fish, you generally get an \"abstract art\".
