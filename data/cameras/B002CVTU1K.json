There are tons of options for improving your pictures, but even with all these options the picture quality still sucks beyond belief.Whoever is giving these rave reviews has never own a real camera and knows nothing about photography.

Im shocked sony puts thier name on this garbage. First of all folks, about the 150$ cameras = total garbage. like a 1500$ car, if you have no money for anything better, fine, but please dont rave to the world how great your 1500$ car is. The picture quality and color on this DSC-W190 is horrid. End of review. Please save your your money for a 300$ cam, this way you will have something semi-decent range, and 450$ and up, should get you a good product. A 450$+ cameras design priority is to take great pictures and not to fit in you pocket be slim and portable. The 150$ item has nothing to advertise but to be slim and portable...since it cant do much else.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good lil camera.", "Author": "J. M.

While I have used it for general as well as as some artsy photography, it is now mostly used to document my automotive projects. Its small design, strong flash, and good focus make it very ideal for photographing parts in tight spaces. And the pictures come out very sharp, though every thing needs a bit of quick touching up in a photo editor. Plus, the camera has taken all kinds of abuse and still turns on takes pictures.

I wish I'd taken the money, added to it and gotten something else! It has never exposed a single indoor flash picture properly.  All flash pics are completely overexposed, it's horrible in low light and it's horrible in otherwise brightly lit indoor situations.  I've wasted countless time adjusting the settings to no avail.

I've owned many cameras made by Sony, and have loved the quality.  I've owned the one that takes the little CD-Rs that looks SLR like and one that took AA batteries.  The camera I owned that had double A batteries started dying when I was at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, TX during a graduation from my retraining school, so I made this purchase on base at AAFES (Army & Air Force Exchange Service).  I didn't take a close look and purchased this because all the other Sony Cameras I've owned have had great picture quality and this had double the megapixels as the one I was replacing, which was a 5.1.  I loved the features on the box; this camera was a 12.1 and half the size of my last one.  I should've returned it the day I got it.  I took a picture of myself right after purchasing it, and you couldn't even see the background; it looked like I had a white backdrop behind me OUTSIDE with none of the greenery in the photo.  So I turned the smile detection off.  Most of the pictures I took were blurry until about the 5th picture.This didn't have the \"Carl Zeiss\" lens which was good on my other camera; this camera has a \"Sony Lense.\"  I wish I didn't purchase this because every camera I've owned that has a Carl Zeiss lense had their pictures come out much better.  I had to bust out my other camera, a Cannon Digital SLR\" for night shots during my vacation back home in Las Vegas.  If you don't have full sunlight with this camera your pictures will come out blurry or washed out.  This was a disappointing purchase.  If I had to buy another camera from Sony I will make sure it has a Carl Zeiss lens, or I won't buy it at all.  It's nice it has the movie feature so you can record brief videos.  Another negative I saw was to view the last picture you had to move the switch down.  There was no \"Preview\" button like on other cameras.  If you're reading this and want my recommendation on a Sony, get one with a Carl Zeiss lense.  This was a bad purchase that I regret due to the bad photos it captures.  Every other camera I've owned produced by Sony, the pictures have come out clear...this is the exception.  Now I have to spend more money getting a better quality camera.  This has been the fifth digital camera I've Owned:  1 Pentax, 3 Sony, and 1 Cannon.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "is that the worst  camera from sony?", "Author": "G D \"scorpio\"", "ReviewID": "R1535DFFQ8DPN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera  for my birthday I was happy when I opened the box  .but this happiness did not last that long  .the pictures not clear and not sharp at all  I tired different setting but  I got the same bad quality  , and I'm surprised why no one review this item on amazon till now . don't  waste your money on this  camera .", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "You can't go wrong", "Author": "Tim K \"Tall Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RVG9X4GQ9TWZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a Christmas present for my son.
