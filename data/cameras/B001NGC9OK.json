I've tried all settings, and all lighting arrangements.  The best shot you have at taking a picture that isn't blurry or horribly distorted is to have your subject to stand outside in the bright sunlight, and use the delayed shot setting (takes the picture 2 or 10 seconds after you push the button).  Then you will probably still have to take the picture 3 times to get one that doesn't look like it was on the television show Ghost Hunters.Bottom line, if you already have a cheap cell phone camera, you have as good or better quality camera than this one.  I do not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "L. Breedveld", "ReviewID": "R336BSPF2WX3CY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,  Great camera.
