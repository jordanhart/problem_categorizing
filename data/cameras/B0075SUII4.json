I consider this a critical part of any camera that is not an SLR. LCD screens should not be the onlyfinder on a camera. I have been using the A1300 for a few weeks now. It has performed perfectly in a great variety  of situationsand lighting  conditions in both auto & program  modes. The viewfinder  tracks with the optical 5X tele. very well. Am very serprisedat how good the 20X digital zoom & stabilization  are.The LCD is bright and adjustable. In the real world of point & shoot photography, not lab tests, this ultra compact took really good photos! Very happy it  uses AA cells. I use Ni.Mh rechargeables &always have extra Alkalines along.. Batt. life has been good. This is the easiest, most fun and now my go to camera. The A1300 is aVery well thought out and executed point & shoot camera.

I use this camera when I am backpacking as it is very lightweight and uses standard AA batteries.  My first experience was this month on a fifty mile hike of the Foothill Trail in South Carolina.  There are many waterfalls and beautiful views and I wanted to take some great pictures.  I was extremely happy with the results.  I returned home with about sixty photos and loaded them to Picassa with the idea of editing and correcting any problems before sharing them with friends and family.  None of the sixty needed any retouching.  They were perfect both in exposure and color rendetion.  Some of the pictures were taken at night of my campfire with the camera set on the A (automatic) position.  They were great.As usual, buying through Amazon was a perfect transaction.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Once again, a Canon, with (of course) an optical viewfinder", "Author": "D. Chambers", "ReviewID": "RFOPMCVCDXWRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For background: we've had a Canon A20, with a magnificent 2 Megapixels (grin), for the last 10 years. One was stolen in airport baggage (my stupidity for packing it). I was thankfully able to buy a replacement A20 on e-Bay. So we have been quite content for about 10 years. This A20 has been bulletproof, you might say.  Fast Forward to 2012. My spouse wanted a smaller, lighter camera--No problem......But I wanted an optical viewfinder--BIG problem; hardly anyone makes them any more. Thank you Canon, for still providing this feature.For those of you wondering what is this -- an optical viewfinder? It is simply a camera that you place up against your cheek, and perhaps use the zoom buttons, to compose the picture. This is how you used to do it with film cameras, before LCD screens were even invented. Single-Lens-Reflex (SLR) cameras, that cost vastly more, use this method, although with vastly improved optics. The alternative is to hold your (non-viewfinder) camera out at arm's length. Which results in:-- Get out your glasses, cuz you can't see enough detail on the toy screen.-- Then, when you finally see your pix, you realize that your cam is unsupported--this will cause BLUR. So you have to take another...-- Then, you hit your forehead with your fist (in anguish) as you realize that the sun is shining so strongly that you cannot see anything on the little screen at all.Then, you retire to the bar and regret not buying a camera with an optical viewfinder. Get 'em while they last. For the price of a bottle of Champagne, you could have bought this camera. Attention: you can still use the LCD screen at arm's length on this camera if you wanna.The other reviews are great; I wanted to call out great emphasis on the viewfinder. Sports and wildlife photographers rely on such viewfinders, since they can track, zoom, and compose a shot (in a fraction of a second) which would be impossible with an LCD display.For those of you thinking of using a cellphone or an i-Pad for photography, fuhgettaboudit. Their pix are horribly granulated (few pixels & small sensors), and as with any handheld, the blurring is atrocious. I know; I've tried. Try not to shame yourself by sharing such pictures.This camera is magnificent. Over the  years I have done darkroom film development, printed enlargements from the negatives, carried camera bags full of changeable lenses for my SLR, had slide projectors; now this is all I need. I can't imagine spending money on a more expensive camera, unless you want to move up to a nice SLR, but that will be bulky and heavy. This cam is 6oz, versus 12.5 for my beloved old A20.I find that most of my relatives and friends take lots of pictures (be it on a cellphone or camera) and then never DO ANYTHING with them. They are not shared with anyone, and mostly just sit on chips or CDs in drawers. So it is worthwhile to point out that this camera includes Canon's album software; the chip pops out for easy unloading (or use the cable connector)--to help us get organized.If you would like a case for this, consider the \"Lowepro - Tahoe 10 Digital Camera Bag - (various colors)\" which is a softcase. I've done trial fits at Beste Buye and it works fine. I ended up buying the Kodak \"Essentials\" hard case. The Case Logic units that I tried were a tad too small.A final word on chargers and batteries. There is no charger. This cam uses two AA batteries; if you need them they are globally available from Topeka to Taipei to Tuscany. If you buy a charger camera, consider: You have one more charger to carry. You already have phone chargers, GPS chargers, Blackberry/i-Pad/PC chargers. Some have two different cables: one 12-volt for a car, and one 120-volt for the wall. Does your cam charger work on dual-voltage 120/220? If not you will need to buy a second one (220v) at great expense for overseas travel. Not to mention another prong-converter for when you finally travel overseas. Ugh. [But do see notes on rechargeables in the Comments On This Review, below]Shopping notes:  This camera does NOT come with a memory card (but does have batteries). Amazon has a good 4GB SD card for about $6. Add it to your shopping cart. When checking out, do NOT buy either of these things with 1-Click, or you will lose free shipping. Add them to the cart, then go to checkout, then change the shipping method to \"free shipping\", then complete.Please comment if you have issues and I will try to address them. Cheers y'all.xxx ooo xxxPS. For me the image size is important for some of my software (it probably won't matter to most people) so just be aware: The A1300 can be set to take 640x480, 1600x1200, or any of 3 even larger formats. My old A20 could take 1024x768 format, but that is not available on the A1300.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon A1300", "Author": "Ken Blkaney", "ReviewID": "R2EU89LC3XTISD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Canon A1300 Sure ShotPros - Has an optical viewfinder !! - a must have in bright sunlight  Uses two AA batteries !! - can buy at almost any store  Confortable in your hand and fits nicely in shirt pocket or purse  Takes a very good still photo  Takes a very good HD Video with good single audio (non-stereo)  Can also take a fairly good standard video  with single audio - good for saving SD Card space  Audio sounds fairly good when having to video in gusty wind conditions - as compared to some other brand cameras  Very easy to use and easy to switch back and forth from Auto to Low Light, etc  and easy to switch back and forth from flash and no flash  Video button on back is separate from the still shot button on top- I like that because I take mostly videos  Very good camera for the priceCons - The videos and still photos are occasionally very blurry and non-usable - as though the auto focus has failed  ( I just turn the camera off and start over again (reboot) and then it is fine )  The optical viewfinder does not show the zoom in/out when videoing but the the LCD does show the zoom in/out while videoing  Does not come with an SD Card - Camera does not have any internal memory so you must buy an SD card  Standard AA batteries last only about one hour when videoing - I recommend using the rechargeable batteries to save moneyConclusion - I like this camera and I would give this camera at least a four star if it were not for the above listed cons - This camera is an  inexpensive point and shoot pocket camera and I recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon A1300", "Author": "Bruce W. hathcock", "ReviewID": "R2RJFT2II4DI6Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Smal portable camera east to operate even without reading a manual if you are used to digital camera, excellet picture quality, even when in moving car the stabilty is supurb.

This camera is actually cheaper than the one it replaced, though it has more features.  Build quality is quite good. I really like having a viewfinder and using AA rechargeable batteries.  If you have ever been stuck with a camera that uses proprietary batteries you will understand.  One can always by AA batteries to keep going. Also, I seldom use a much larger camera I have since I find it easier to take along a camera that will fit into a pocket. The 5x  Zoom works well, and the pictures come out quite good. I don't like using digital zoom which reduces the pixels used.  I was especially pleased with the macro setting... pictures of flowers are quite stunning.The camera has lots of features, but many are buried in the menus.  You really need to read the manual (which is a pdf file on the disc) in order to get the most out of it. ISO and shutter speed settings are all there, once you discover them.I am an amateur photographer, so I do have a lot of pictures in the My Pictures folder (Using Windows).  To my surprise, the Image Express software supplied with the camera told me that I had way too many pictures for it to work. After that message it promptly closes the program.  Tried it several times, and I suppose there are work-arounds on this issue.  Fortunately, it is redundant software.since Windows immediately recognizes the camera and flawlessly transfers the pictures from the camera to the hard drive. My recommendation is to skip that program during the customized install (the other software seems to work, though I usually use the consumer version of Photoshop.No, this isn't a massive high end camera and doesn't pretend to be.

Holst", "ReviewID": "R32I5ONYOYBMER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped extensively before buying the A1300 Canon. I weighed the value of using a pair of AA cells versus a dedicated power pack. I included the ability to use rechargeable cells - the precharged cells with long shelf life. Because this is a grab-and-go camera, it needs to be ready at a moment's notice. AA cells are great for that. And it's the camera our 10 year old will use and he's not at all good about keeping his electronic gizmoz charged, so the AA feature is a plus there. I also like the optical view finder. Holding a camera at arm's length is the norm, but heads are fairly steady, so the camera is also quite steady when used with the optical finder. It's a simple tunnel, but it is accurate and simple. I also kept in mind the fact that this is a camera in the $100 price range and there is no reason to expect lens quality, flash range, manual control or any other feature to be equal to a camera in the $200 or higher price range. So we shopped and ordered from Amazon.Delivery was on time as expected. The camera came with all of the accessories listed in the ad - a very basic kit. Our first go with this piece was disappointing. It seems that even the major manufacturers can produce a dud from time to time. Our A1300 was a battery hog. I immediately contacted Canon through their website, explained the problem and what I had done to try to correct the problem. They asked that I return the camera to them and the replacement arrived in less than one week. The new one is spot-on.So what about the A1300? The AUTO function is impressive. It does more than I ever expected a point and shoot to do - automatically. The color brightness and focus are good and the photo details are great. I don't see any odd colors and it does adjust to ensure people are people colored, no matter what the color of the people. So if the photos from the A1300 are good, How good is good? My Canon S3 takes a VERY GOOD photo. My friends Canon EOS DSLR takes EXCELLENT photos. It's not an issue of photo size, it's quality and clarity. And this little camera holds it's ground very well. I also have a lesser brand camera about the same size as the A1300 that takes poor quality photos. Sure I can tell what the photo is, who is in it and where we were, and the features of that one are excellent but it's just not crisp in the details. So in my opinion, a good photo is one that doesn't give me any particular reason to complain. I'm sure there are aberations that a pro could find in a detailed review, but that's not why I got this camera. This one is in the glove box, in the pocket of my motorcycle jacket and at family functions where I don't want the obvious BIG camera that makes people nervous. It takes a far better photo than my cell phone.At full optical zoom at about 150 feet I can count the blades of grass in my neighbor's lawn with the camera set at 16mp.  I am not used to having such a wide angle on a digital camera and I am getting scenery shots that look great. It handles the light whether I am shooting into the sun or with the sun at my back. I have not tried some of the special programs offered, but of the ones that I have tried, the low light setting allows me to get very nice photos in museum lighting. The Stealth option is both low light and silent so the camera is not a bother when discretion is needed. And the digital IS mode works well. I'm past my prime and I'm not as steady as I once was. Our boy is young and is also not rock steady. Digital IS gives us a good shot every time. The video function gives me bright and clear HD videos - or far more compact 640x480 videos. I wish the zoom worked with in video mode but that's one thing I gave up in this price range. For motorcycle trips with the guys, it's great to be able to set the camera to 640x 480 and just shoot lots of pics that are easy to email and look fine on the computer monitor. Shooting one handed as I ride doesn't always get me a great shot, but if I shoot enough shots I get plenty of great photos to share. Fun - cheap - reliable - great quality. What else could I ask from a $100 price range camera?  But, you don't want to drop it into the lake. That's another story and there are far better models if that's part of your plan.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "A1300 has it all", "Author": "Mary J.

Curley", "ReviewID": "R2W8FBIDZHNZZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon Powershot A1300 to replace a Canon Powershot SD850 IS that had developed a focusing problem. On the plus side; it has double the resolution at 16 megapixels, a little more zoom (5x), and HD recording. The A1300 is slightly taller, but is lighter than the SD850. The wider lens angle is a bonus on the A1300 also. Sunlight pictures are fast and sharp on both, but the A1300 had a noticeable recycle delay compared to the SD850. I'm assuming that is due to the AA batteries, although I was using Nihm rechargeables. The SD850 came with a rechargeable Nihm battery, and in my experience, they seem to work better. The A1300 used the flash in many situations were it was not needed. It's easy to turn off, but you need to remember to turn it back on. Both cameras took good low light pictures. Canon resolved one issue with previous Powershots, including the SD850, they made the battery compartment door more secure. Older models had a habit of sliding open during use, shuting down the camera. The A1300 can still be slid open, but has a small clip to make it less likely by accident. One thing I miss from the SD850 is the mode selector dial. Now it's on screen, which could be a problem in bright daylight. The power switch is moved to the top and easier to push on the A1300. The SD850 feels more expensive (and it was) than the A1300. It's heavier, and looks more solid. The A1300 looks plastic (it is)and is noticeably lighter, which may be a plus. At less than $100 though, the A1300 packs a lot of value in that samll package. It fits in a pocket or purse, can substitute AA alkalines in a pinch, takes great pictures and has both a viewfinder and a LCD screen. I haven't taken any video yet. I only use pocket cameras for video if a video camera isn't available. I'll comment later on that.The A1300 falls in the compact camera range. They should be easy to use, light, easy to carry, and have features that allow good sharp pictures in most situations. The A1300 fills that slot at a minimum cost. Now that cameras are electronic and digital, they upgrade as often as PCs. The A1300 is inexpensive, yet gives results that rival expensive SLR cameras. At this price, you can buy one now and donate it in 3 years to buy an upgraded model, or give it to your kid.April 1, 2013 - Update: I've used the camera under several lighting conditions. In outdoor light, it takes excellent pictures, however indoor existing light leaves much to be desired. It is grainy, and focus is not very good, with very short focus range. I also noticed multicolored lines (vertical) when shooting indoor. Not sure why. Severe lag time using flash due to long recharge times. I've since upgraded to a Canon SX40HS, a far superior camera.

Bruha", "ReviewID": "R17IS5UCUV5TLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While not a professional photographer by any means, I have used all sorts of cameras, from the disposables, to SLRs, both digital and 35MM.  Except for the near pro-grad 35MM camera that I got at a yard sale for next to nothing, this Canon is probably the most camera I have gotten for the money.Image quality is very, very good, with a couple caveats.  First is the potential for blur.  Any time you are in a low-light situation, the shutter seems to be open longer than it would be on an SLR, so it is not so good on low light action shots, and be sure in low light situations to hold the camera very still, as any shakes will result in blur, as well.  It is probably not any worse than any other compact point and shoot, but definately noticable coming from an SLR.  The other comment is the delay, both the split second delay from the time you hit the button until the picture is taken (which is greatly reduced by pressing the shutter button halfway down, which focuses the camera, and preps it for the shot) and the time it takes for the flash to recharge.  Using photo batteries helps the flash recharge faster, but it still isn't up to par with my SLR or my wifes full-size Canon.The zoom works well, and leaves the pictures clear, all the way to the limits of the optical zoom.  Like any other digital camera that adds a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, picture quality starts to drop, as the digital zoom increases.Now, to the reasons why I bought it, and why I recommend it.The pictures are of quite good quality, very clear up to 8X10, and even beyond in good light, even surprisingly good, considering the camera's size and price point.  It also takes very good pics with the flash, or in low light on still objects.The main reasons I bought this particular camera, however, have to do with practicality.  It is small, about the size of a deck of cards, but just a little thicker.  However, for it's small size, it has a fairly large screen in the back, as well as a standard viewfinder (if you are outside, with the sun behind you, a viewfinder works much better than the screen).Also, it takes standard sized AA batteries, of all types.  I have tried it with standard batteries, alkaline batteries, photo batteries, and Li-Ion rechargable batteries.  The camera worked flawlessly, with all of them, really the only differences between them are how many pics you can take on a set of batteries, and how fast the flash recharges.  Normally, I have a pair of rechargables in the camera, and another pair in the case, and have gotten by fine with that so far.  Once a few years ago, we took a family vacation, and our camera batteries went dead, and we could do nothing until we charged them up overnight.  With this camera, I could have bought batteries at about any convenience store, and been fine.It also uses a standard removable SD card, which I like.  Again, on vacation, I can use one card for each day, and have the pictures half sorted right away.I guess the strongest reason I can give for recommending this camera is that it is now the most used one in the household.  It is small enough to take with you anywhere, it is simple and easy to use (very straightforward controls, laid out in a common sense way), it boots up very quickly, meaning it takes very little time from when you turn it on, to when you can take pictures, and lastly, it has good photo quality.  Anymore, we don't even break out my wife's 'good' camera anymore, except to take family portriats, or other things we might want bigger than 8X10.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot A1300", "Author": "SageTrek", "ReviewID": "R39R5N7TIN1CBA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This point-and-shoot camera takes good photos, is easy to use, and is light weight.I have used versions of the Canon PowerShot for years.

Two of the reasons I choose PowerShot cameras for trips and outdoor photos is 1) they have an optical view finder, and 2) they use AA batteries.Without an optical viewfinder, in bright sunlight it can be difficult to see the scene to be photographed or the last photo taken when looking at the LCD screen. Optical view finders are getting harder to find on point-and-shoot cameras. Powershot photos always shows a little more of the scene than the scene viewed through the view finder. And, the view finder seems to aim a little high.Use of AA batteries is important to me when traveling because, in most countries, AA batteries are readily available.

If you are on a strict budget and want something with a little more flexibility than your phone, the Canon A1300 is a great option. Especially for traveling because of the AA battery power source.The camera is made of plastic like most in this price range but still feels well put together. It has a nice grip on the front making it comfortable to hold and shoot with. You have a straight-forward control setup on the back. The ? button is a complete guide to all the camera's functions to help you out if you don't understand what a certain feature will do etc etc.The LCD on back is not the highest resolution but pretty good for this class of camera and mostly visible in most shooting conditions. Of course you can always adjust the LCD brightness in the menu system to suit your needs. The viewfinder is not very big but as far as I know, it's the only camera in this price range that offers one. And point and shoots that cost twice and three times as much don't have one, so it was nice for Canon to include it on this model.I was actually pleasantly surprised at the shooting performance on this model. The AF is reasonably quick in good light, it slows down some in dim light but it's still not too bad. Shot to shot times are somewhat slow. One slightly annoying thing (and this has been true on previous A series models as well) is that if you're wanting to shoot using the flash..you have to wait for it to charge. The delay is relatively brief but can get annoying after awhile. But in this class of camera, that is something I'm willing to forgive. The lens sounds kind of loud and mechanical when zooming in and out, but not as bad as some of the older A-series models.As with most cameras in this price class, you don't have full manual control. You can control the ISO and other things like exposure compensation. However, one thing the camera does have is a function called Live View Control. Basically this allows you to adjust the darkness and brightness, color vibrancy, and to make the scene warmer or cooler. This is a great feature to have in lieu of manual control and its highly recommended that you exploit this feature in order to get the best photos out of your A1300.Overall image quality is very nice. With good color reproduction, sharpness, and detail capture. Honestly, I read some of the reviews of this camera saying it has poor image quality and wondered if they were talking about the same camera or are expecting too much out of an entry-level point and shoot. But the camera can produce some very nice photos especially if you use the Live View Control and other adjustments. Its low-light photos aren't too bad. There is increased noise and detail smearing, especially above ISO400 but not as bad as some others I have seen. You can still get usable low-light photos out of this camera if you are just uploading them to facebook or flickr and not blowing them up to huge sizes.Video is not bad on the camera but suitable for short clips. I would not buy this camera primarily for shooting video, though. Some of the more expensive powershots are better suited for video capture.Overall, this is a very nice camera and a great value. It produces decent photos, has an AA battery source which makes it a great camera to travel with, its comfortable to shoot with, and the shooting performance is decent for its class.

Indeed there is a pretty annoying delay. In fact, if you want to use the flash, I hope you have lots of time to let the flash 'charge'. I know that cameras have to charge a capacitor to fire the flash, but this delay is about 3-4 seconds. It doesn't sound like a long time but it is quite irritating.The pictures are also pretty poor. Inside, (even when it's not super dark) the pictures come out very blurred. I can't tell if it's a focusing problem or just a slow shutter speed but the pictures come out very bad. Amazon claims that it has image stabilization, but I highly doubt it. It doesn't say anywhere on the camera about it having IS.

First off, the battery life is terrific, which was the main point I was looking at when I read previous reviews of this camera and several others.  The pictures are very sharp and clear, and the zoom function works beautifully, and was MUCH easier to figure out than that on my old Nikon.  There are only two drawbacks to this camera that I have found, so far; when you click the shutter to take the pic, it seems to take a while before you can use the camera again -- which makes it iffy to line up horizontally when taking a series for a panorama.  I suspect this is probably common to all low-priced cameras (same thing with my old Nikon).  The other thing may be something I can overcome, as I grow more familiar with the camera: when taking pics outdoors, the colors seem to have very low saturation, very washed-out looking; I always have to boost saturation in Photoshop, before putting the pics on my website, but since I have to scale down the immense size anyway, not really a big deal, and perhaps I can figure out something about the \"compensation\" setting that will alleviate this problem -- I'm a point-and-shoot photographer, not a photography-geek.  But, despite the colors seeming weak, the hue of the images is right on the money, no weird color-artifacts as I have sometimes seen with other cameras, and no yellowing when taking pics indoors -- a HUGE problem with the old Nikon.  As others have reported, the accompanying software gives all kinds of error msgs when you try to install it, and even when you try to update it, though afterward, it seems to be installed and functional.  However I had to uninstall it, and the \"Canon Picture Window\" or whatever it is, because when you plug in the camera to the computer, turn it on, and the \"picture window\" splash screen comes up, it takes *****FOREVER***** almost like the whole system is \"hung,\" and it hangs right in front of everything else, so you can't even go about your business while it's ***SLOWLY*** starting the software.  Nuts to that; I uninstalled all software that came with the camera, and use the TWAIN-WIA interface in Photoshop to get the pics from the camera, and doing that, it's a heck of a lot quicker to download the images than from my old Nikon.  So, they make excellent cameras, and truly crappy software.  Oh, and the old-style optical viewfinder is a real gem; I used it just today when photographing my garden in bright sunlight, and the LCD was nearly invisible in the bright light; really excellent addition to the standard inexpensive digital camera!  Another really cool feature I discovered, though I can't personally use it with the printer I currently have, is the ability to connect it directly to a printer via USB, for printing direct from the camera.  Perhaps I'll have a photo-printer at some point, and this feature will be REALLY handy.  So, although the camera is still a bit new to me, and I still have a few things to figure out about it, on the whole I am TERRIFICALLY pleased with it.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best compact camera for the price", "Author": "Green Eyes", "ReviewID": "R3MSQ2MSQ8WMAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In addition to the usual Canon quality and value, this camera has a feature nearly unique on current point-and-shoot cameras: A REAL OPTICAL VIEWFINDER !!! This is a fantastic 'old school' feature that nearly all point-and-shoots once had, but is nearly impossible to find now on a budget-priced camera.You can compose photos much better with a real viewfinder than is possible with a 2-3 inch display. Using the viewfinder you can steady the camera against your face, compose your shot even in bright sunlight, and extend battery life by turning off the display while shooting. You also don't look like a drunken goober holding your camera out at arm's length and squinting your eyes while taking pictures.Can you imagine buying an SLR or top-of-the-line compact without a viewfinder?!?

The PowerShot A1300 takes good photos, but a little slow on shutter speed for candid shots. Speed can be increased by slightly holding down the shutter button (red light shows) then push it down completely. On Automatic, it's easy to operate and the red video button clearly marked.  The video portion is fair, but audio not that great.  My biggest complaint is the miserable software. Half the time it didn't recognize the camera device in a USB port. Will say the Tech Support at Canon is wonderful. Post them taking me through a number of steps, I'm now able to by-pass the software and click on the blue button to the left of the Menu, to bring up photos.

On the other hand, that leaves the impact of the zoom a little weak. It has a very wide aperture for a camera this inexpensive, so it performs a little better than I expected in low light conditions. I like the independent button for recording videos, so while shooting stills, you can transition to a video very quickly and easily.The LCD screen is not very good though, so it's hard to tell if the photos are coming out very nicely. The trick is to assume that they are a little sharper and a little more underexposed than they look on the screen.

However, while the viewfinder on this A1300 16.0 MP camera is helpful, it only provides the view.  I still have to use the screen to see any additional information about the picture, which limits the usefulness of the viewfinder.  In addition, the picture quality does not seem to be as good as my older Canon.  This is a subjective opinion.  I haven't put similar pictures side by side.  And, to be fair to the cameras, I'm a point and shoot photographer. While I know these cameras have many wonderful optional settings, If I'm on a hike, I leave the setting on AUTO when taking pictures.  If I'm going to be taking pictures indoors or on a cloudy day, I still choose my older SD1300IS 12.1 MP camera.  It's smaller, solidly built and has excellent picture quality and battery life.

Fairly powerful considering its size (and do remember you can't be across the parking lot and have the flash do anything).-Great viewfinder. Obviously, close-up you have to watch for parallax error but that's when the rear LCD should be used.The Bad:-It's possible the camera is -too- small to handle well. The A590 had a really pronounced grip whereas what passes for a grip on the A1300 is really just the bulge where the AA's and SD card reside.-Only one serious design flaw. When shooting video, zooming is purely digital so any zooming in results in extreme pixelation. You'll have to stop the video, zoom in optically, then re-start the video in order to have an \"optical telephoto\" result instead of that awful digital zoom. Why Canon engineers chose to go down this path is just a mystery. The 720p video without digital zoom is tack-sharp and certainly could have been the basis of a killer digicam-corder. At this price, I could have pointed at expensive DSLRs and laughed. As it is, however, the camcorder function is mediocre simply because of the lack of optical zoom during shooting. What a disappointment.Bottom Line: I bought the camera for the stills and considered the 720p video a bonus. However, with the digital zoom producing unacceptable video, I'll still need a camcorder (or a decent bridge camera like the Fuji XS1 which can do it all, albeit in a considerably larger size).", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot A1300 Digital Camera", "Author": "Carol A Trow", "ReviewID": "R3H79MX2YC2WGQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this would be reasonable camera to have handy to catch those on the spot pics, but it is the worst camera to set up a photo or video.

Having 16 Megapixels is a complete waste, since upon enlarging, the lens image degrades long before the need for 16MP. I reduced the image size to 8MP, and even that is more than this lens needs.

Previously I had a similar experience with a Canon PowerShot SD800 IS that suddenly produced magenta streaks. Neither camera was dropped or abused, thus my conclusion is that Canon's image sensors include a high percentage of defective units! Unfortunately I had not kept the warranty stuff on file, thus it was a total loss in both instances. (Unfortunately this Amazon product review system doesn't seem to provide an opportunity to upload illustrative photos.)Live and learn, because of the viewfinder I have just bought an A1300, but this time I also bought bought the $20 two-year comprehensive insurance and will make sure I keep all the documentation on file.

I've long since stopped using film cameras and am using small point-in-shoot digital cameras due to the prohibitive cost of eSLRs.These small but increasingly sophisticated PnS digitals have much to be said for them, and I finally decided that instead of using my cell for casual shots I would keep a small digital camera that would reside in my glovebox.I picked this little Canon A1300 because it has something which virtually no digital camera priced under $300 has - an optical viewfinder. I know I'm old-fashioned but I still find awkward the need to use a digital display that requires distance between my eye and the camera.  When I found this A1300 I barely looked at any reviews or specs - the thought of having an optical viewfinder again made me believe, rightly it turns out, that I wasn't taking as many photos nor enjoy taking pictures as much using digital viewfinder.An optical viewfinder makes the 'shoot' in point-and-shoot a much faster process for me, and if you grew up during the pre-digital days I think this camera will do the same for you.Amended - A recent weekend at Asilomar on the Pacific coast -late March 2013, 63 degrees, sunny and no wind - proved up with no doubt the utility of an optical viewfinder.

A quality set of alkaline were subsequently installed and may provide additional continuous shooting time, for example when recording video shots.

I've used the 'low light' with the same results. It takes FOREVER to 'focus' ...again, imagine your subject standing perfectly still with the painted on smile, waiting and waiting.The ONLY thing I like about this camera is the optical viewfinder and IT only shows about 80% of the scene that will be captured.In summary, I got better photos with my Baby Brownie camera in 1955!!!!RUN away from this camera!", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "mutantdustbunny", "ReviewID": "R3HSNQTU2S4STC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great, one day I'll understand better how it works.

I recently took about 600 photos in Europe and the results were very good.

As technology advanced, each device had its own learning curve.  The A1300 generation went from buttons and dials to just buttons, so now instead of a glance and thumb to change modes, a dance through buttons and menus is needed.  It is harder to use then previous, but does take excellent pictures with good automation if you want it.  Confusing the shutter and power buttons is very easy.The Canon picture transfer program is also a step backward, it is not compatible to older cameras and doesn't work across network shares, so load it separately from older programs.  No major improvements from previous programs.The camera uses AA batteries, which is good because of availability far and wide.  No matter how good a rechargeable is, when its dead, its hours away from being usable again.  You can't judge battery usage by picture count, figure on 45 minutes to an hour of continuous use or 2 to 3 sets a day during ambitious site seeing.All in all, if you are looking for a good grab and snap pocket/purse camera, the A1300 is a good choice.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera but one or two querks", "Author": "Jak", "ReviewID": "R6O4O2W897P2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall a very nice camera ans well worth the price.

They say it can be put on one's phone, but that will take more than twice as long to find the appropriate section and then is much harder to read on portable equipment.  Most people who have cameras want an instruction book to put in their camera bag so that they can refer to it.

I wanted a camera to take on bicycle rides and to take in my pocket around town with me. There were some positive reviews, and the Canon PowerShot A1300 is around 4 stars overall. I'm not quite sure how, though.The pictures this camera takes are very poor quality. I tested it out on a nice day. In good lighting outside (some light clouds, so it was not a harsh lighting situation) and photos were very washed out. The colors are not vibrant at all. I had the camera on the highest quality setting, and from about 20 feet away I took a photo of my car. Under magnification on the computer, the lettering on my license plate was too fuzzy to read. 16MP?I did a final test with this camera. I took the same photo / view outside in good lighting during the day with this camera and with my cell phone (8MP camera on the Samsung Galaxy SII). I asked my family which photo was better -- the cell phone photo won. The colors were better, the contrast was better, the image was clearer; just an overall better photo from the cell phone than from the A1300.The camera is being returned to Amazon. Why carry an extra item, when it does not take very good photos?
