{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great \"Fun\" Camera", "Author": "surfbum", "ReviewID": "R3521LUQQ5UX53", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  This review was updated on 9/1/08 to reflect the announcement of the Olympus 1050SW.I am a self confessed camera freak. I have owned the Pentax WPi, W10, W30, and now, the W60. My other primary cameras are the Canon SD 870 (with waterproof housing for diving) and a Canon SLR system with L series lenses, etc. I live in Hawaii and I travel for a living and I can say that without a doubt, the Pentax W series of cameras have been my \"go to\" cameras for any activities that involve water, snow, sand, or dirt. They take A LOT of abuse even if they don't advertise that fact like Olympus. For optical quality in a \"friendly\" environment when I don't want to lug my SLR, I prefer my Canon SD 870 which has noticeably better optics.Like many people who somehow trashed their previous W series camera, I have been waiting over a year for the W30 upgrade and I can report that all in all, the W60 is a worthy upgrade to the W30 if only for the 28mm lens. In addition, it's lighter, the screen is brighter, and it's got a couple of useful software upgrades. I've been using the camera for a month now.Make no mistake, this is a \"fun\" outdoors camera. If you're not going to take your camera in the water, to the beach, or mountain biking stop reading now and find a camera with better optics. The W60 is just o.k. and certainly no worse than the W30. As for the barrel distortion at 28mm, it's probably just slightly worse than my Canon SD 870 which means that the distortion is there and is noticeable, but for a group shot at the beach or trying to get the full length of a kayak AND an isle in the background, I'll live with the ever so slight distortion. You can always just click the lens down to 37mm and eliminate the distortion just like any other compact.I'll also confess that I'm a Mac user and therefore don't know how to read manuals. Because of this, I find the \"smile detect\" and \"blink detect' features amazingly annoying although they seem to work as long as your subjects are not wearing sunglasses. Fortunately, for illiterate and/or lazy idiots such as myself, you can ignore most features and easily find the important ones like underwater white balance.Here's what I like and dislike about this particular model.LIKES1) Nothing beats not worrying about sand, water, dirt, or mud. I had the Olympus 1030SW for two days before sand screwed up the retractable lens cover (great idea, poor execution which has been addressed on the recently announced 1050SW). Also, if you let your kids take photos like I do, you can worry less about camera damage when one of them inevitably throws your camera at the other one or tries to hit them over the head with it in the pool.2) 28mm lens. Wide angle (vs. the typical 38mm) is an option I'd rather have than not.  Also, there is a crazy \"wide\" feature that's a bit different than panoramic stitch that actually works pretty well. In a nutshell, two portrait shots are stitched in camera into a 5MP 21mm image. It's by no means \"publishable\" quality, but I've actually been having quite a bit of fun with it.DISLIKES1) HD movie clips. I was very disappointed that the 720p movie clips are only 15 fps. My old Canon S80 had the same specs and I find the jerkiness at 15 fps too distracting. The initial press release (specs since updated) didn't disclose this. Oh well. I'd still buy it. 640 movie clips at 30 fps are as clean as expected and the shake reduction works fairly well (but reduces the frame to something less than 28mm). Also, a note on reviewers who complain about sound recorded from the focusing drive, switch to infinity focus which works fine in 90% of all situations and that annoying sound will be eliminated).2) Noticeable barrel distortion at 28mm. Like I said earlier, better to have the option available and zoom in when able. Even at 28mm, your shot won't be ruined. Also, if you have a mother-in-law you can cleverly position her at the end of the frame and the distortion will make her look slightly thinner (in case she accuses your SLR of making her look fat).3) Still no travel charger included or officially available (which I find inexcusable) although inelegant third party solutions exist online (and the multi battery use ones still work even though they've changed the battery model).4) No external user replaceable lens protecter. Come on Pentax engineers. How hard would it be to design an exterior casing that allowed for a user replaceable transparent protective \"filter\" like an SLR. There's a reason I've bought four models. I trash them.Now for the important feature: Underwater ImagingIf you want a camera for scuba diving stop reading now and go buy yourself a Canon with any of their factory built cases. This is not a diving camera.If you want a camera for snorkeling, kayaking, surfing, or kiteboarding; or if you plan to take your camera to the beach; or if you like hiking in the rain or mountain biking, you will be stoked with this camera. (Previous W series models I owned worked fine in the snow and cold whereas my compact Canons sometimes freeze) The Olympus 1030SW is a close second for me for the following reasons. 1) I like the rectangle form factor of the Pentax a tad more; 2) I find SD cards more convenient than XD cards (plus I own a bunch and my computer has a slot for them); 3) a personal bad experience with the 1030SW retractable lens cover; 4) movies on the Olympus models are capped at 10 seconds (vs. the size of your memory card on the Pentax - 30 minutes on my 4GB card); and 5) the Pentax is noticeably lighter (but does not feel cheap). I think there's also some merit to the fact that this is Pentax's sixth generation of W series cameras. They've learned a lot. Also, I should mention that I used to use a Sony compact with a waterproof \"Sport\" case and besides making the whole camera \"fat\", the picture quality suffered greatly.UPDATE regarding the new Olympus 1050SW:  While i have not used this camera (to be released on 10/31/08) from the specs and photos I can see that they have addressed the retractable lens cover issue with a Sony style system however they have increased the focal length to 38mm (equivalent).  I'd still prefer a 28mm.  Also, 640 movies are still inexplicably capped at 10 seconds vs. the size of you memory card for the Pentax models.Underwater videos of kids in the pool rock (set focus to infinity in the Settings menu to avoid mechanical noise). Videos of them surfing are priceless (buy yourself a neckstrap). Being able to wash your camera off at the end of the day is amazing. It's also kind of fun to drop it in a mug of beer at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich and freak your friends out.I highly recommend the Pentax W60 for anyone that has an outdoor lifestyle and likes to record memories. It's a great secondary camera when paired with something a bit more serious like an SLR. It is not the best camera for going out for a night on the town and it's not the best camera if you're going on the vacation of a lifetime that doesn't involve a lot of water or dirt.

Li \"outdoor lover\"", "ReviewID": "RCWC41816422X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Clearly, this is not a camera for everybody. It's designed for those outdoor enthusiasts who's willing to trade the picture quality for the taking anywhere feature. I wish I could have a compact camera that can be used anywhere but still has DSLR picture quality -- but that camera doesn't exist!If the underwater capability is important to you, then there are not so many choices out there -- and the only two get head to head are Olympus 1030 and the Pentax W60. Both are 10M pixels which I don't think it's really needed -- you can't fully use the 10M capability because of the lens quality. Some important difference:- Olympus can go 30 ft deep, Pentax 10 ft.- Olympus is crash proof, Pentax is not- Olympus's lens is 28-105, Pentax is 28-140- Both can take video of 640x480, up to the size of the flash card (Olympus may need a firmware upgrade), but Pentax can take 1280x720 in 15 fps.- Olympus can't use zoom during video taking, Pentax can, but records the zoom sound as well.- Pentax has slightly better picture quality, but little noisier.- Pentax uses SD/SDHC card, Olympus uses xdpicture card, which is more expensive.Finally I decided to go with the Pentax.Things I like besides the under water capability:- Feature rich. There are 24 different scene mode, a good fit to novice users, and there are also face detection, blink detection, smile detection and some on-camera editing capability. You can also do the slide-show on camera.- Easy to follow interface. I learned to use more than 90% of the functions without even reading the manual.- Macro that closes up to 1cm, not so many cameras are capable of that.- Picture color is normally good.- Live histogram viewThings I don't like:- Poor low light performance, very noisy- The so-called image stabilizing is just to bump up the ISO, which cause noisier image- Below average image quality (comparing other point and shoot)- Metering/White Balance/EV Adjustment only available in the P mode! This is my biggest complaint. I don't know what's in Pentax engineer's mind. I can live with no AP/SP/manual mode, but I still need these adjustments!- No lens cover. Even though there is a protective layer in the front, so one can't touch the real lens, but that layer can still get dirty and I'm also afraid to simply put the camera in my pocket with other stuff.With all that said, am I returning the camera? The hell no! I have my DSLR for better image quality, but I still need a compact one that I can bring with me on trips to ski, beach, or even snorkeling!", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Does it all and does it well!", "Author": "A.G. \"Born  a Yankee\"", "ReviewID": "RFMUNFFHAS7J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because of serious spray I needed a waterproof camera with a wide angle lens for an August 11 trip to Niagara Falls (\"Slowly I turned..\"). I saw the Pentax Optio W60 on Amazon with an expected release date of August 5 so I was preparing to settle for the W30. Then, while surfing the site it came up as \"in stock\" on July 10. I immediately ordered it with Super Saver shipping and had it in my hands by noon on July 16. This was way faster than I had hoped for. I spent the next 11 hours studying it and the manual. The manual is 240 pages, all in English, soI am not going to bore you with a list of features. You can see them for yourself on the Amazon and Pentax web sites. What I will say is that the pictures I took while learning the camera last night were excellent. If this camera does not meet all your needs in a point and shoot camera then its unlikely anything will.  It definitely meets my needs. Its waterproof and shockproof and has a 5X zoom (28-140, 35mm equivalent) as well as 5.7X digital zoom and movie mode with zoom and sound. My only suggestion, at this time, would be that the battery compartment door latch button could be a little more substantial. You will need an extra D-LI78 battery or its higher mah equivalent. The supplied battery is only 680mah. I spoke with Paul at Pentax customer service. His recommendation was that there was no need to spend extra for class 4 or class 6 SD cards, class 2 cards would be fine. Because of built-in camera hardware limitations I would only gain minimal write speed with class 4 or 6 cards. I did as he suggested and the write speed is very fast with the class 2 (standard) Sandisk cards. As a former photo retailer with over 20 years experience in camera sales I feel safe when I say \"BUY THIS CAMERA!\" You will not be disappointed.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good waterproof camera", "Author": "Widget", "ReviewID": "RA2GXFZSOPR34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera the other day.  So far it seems like a good compromise camera.  I kayak a lot, and I don't want to risk my digital slr when I'm out on salt water.  I've hesitated a lot before buying a waterproof camera because their quality for the price has always seemed less.  I finally bit the bullet on this camera because of the 5x optical zoom and the ability to take macro pictures from 1 cm away. Unlike the olympus underwater camera this takes SD cards - I couldn't see buying an xD card.  This camera is capable of taking beautiful photos, the 1 cm macro is fun - shove my camera into a flower and see what I get.Negatives so far:- Lots of noise in low light, especially when zoomed in- I don't like that there's not a cover that closes over the lens when you turn off the camera.  It means you should definitely have a dedicated case for it.- Optical image stabilization would have been a great addition to this camera.I bought the kata snapshot D camera case for the camera and it fits well:Kata Ergo-Tech Series Snapshot D Small Flap Pouchhttp://www.amazon.com/Ergo-Tech-Snapshot-Digital-Personal-Electronics/dp/B000I3XY2A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=photo&qid;=1216695649&sr;=1-1samples pics and more details at:[...]", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fine for still pictures, USELESS for taking movies, and here's why...", "Author": "Heath L.

with the basics and then you can watch the video review for the whole story.Still shots: no issue. There are a number of capture modes such as: auto, program, night scene, underwater, landscape, flower, portrait, digital wide, surf and snow, kids, et, half-length portrait, sports, fireworks, voice recording, night scene, text, food, panorama, just to name a few. 10 megapixels allows for blowing up pictures without losing quality.Video mode: here's where I have the showstopper. You either have videos with auto focus off and have blurry videos, or you have it with autofocus turned on and a loud and constant clicking sound recorded onto your video. Both options makes your video completely useless.And now for my video review, where you can listen and see for yourself the problem I have with the camera (that I will now be returning).", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worse than the old Wpi", "Author": "Chad Nason", "ReviewID": "R9P7IIM3TS0FE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, I spend a lot of time fly-fishing, which generally entails a wet and often sandy camera.  Having owned and loved an Optio Wpi (2-3 generations back), I immediately went for the new Pentax waterproof over the comparable Olympus.  The main reason that I was told that Olympus' retracting lens cover is easily jammed by sand.  So I was an easy sell on the w60, after finding out I couldn't buy another wpi - which could have used the 4 batteries I now own for a broken camera.  I should mention that broke the wpi, it was so sturdy it could have lasted for ages had I not put about 300 lbs of pressure between it and a solid metal object.  I just bought the w60 and took it out for a week on the river.  Here are my three frustrations:1. light areas are totally washed out.  I know, I have to figure out the settings to correct this issue... and I will correct the issue.  But the settings are going to need serious tweaking before the w60 will take sensible photos.  I mean, there was rarely 'true black' in any of my shots.  Inexcusable & highly disappointing to have amateur looking vacation photos.  The old wpi took awesome - truly awesome - pics straight out of the box.2. some settings dont seem to stick after powering down.  i cant tell you how many times I unchecked the \"digital zoom\" box, only to find my camera digitally zooming after powering back on.  That's the only one I've seen not sticking so far, but I've only been playing with the camera here and there for the last 5 days.  digital zoom is useless, in case you're wondering why this is one of my complaints.  It basically does on your camera what your home computer can already do... and it sucks battery life.  Never be impressed by a camera's digital zoom feature.3. at full wide angle, corners get faded out.  This is a minor issue for me, but definitely true.  I read it elsewhere, so I was on the lookout.  When you're zoomed out entirely, the corners of your photos CAN (not always) fade a little.  eg, took a picture at twilight, corners were darker than they should have been.  that being said, the wide angle is an amazing feature.  In one frame, I could fit the boat I was fishing on, my fishing companion and his fish, and the incredible landscape/backdrop.  I don't know how i lived with out this before.Other than that, it's an amazing camera.  I just wish I had known about these issues before I bought and shot vacation photos all week.  Other cool features include a 'digital panorama' that will absolutely knock your socks off.  it stitches three photos together for you... but also leaves a little 'ghost' at the end of each shot so you know where you left off.  The result is perfect panoramas.  There's a 'digital wide' feature that is similar but combines two 'portrait' (ie rotated 90 degrees) photos together in case 10 MP isnt a big enough pic for you.my opinion:  buy this camera if you spend time near the water, or just want that added layer of protection.  it's perfect for your pocket, boat, river, kids' soccer game, etc.  Not an SLR, but great for everyday use.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent features, not quite HD video, so-so sound.", "Author": "Travelin' Man", "ReviewID": "R1TIGAN3VF1IQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the W60 primarily on the strength of it being a waterproof camera with 720p HD video.  I have two Pentax DSLR's and generally like the brand.The camera itself is pretty terrific, with a slew of features (face/smile detection, audio recorder, waterproof) that are nicely customizable.  Still image quality is good, especially if you limit the Auto ISO to 50-400 to manage the noise.  The camera is quick to focus, and the flash seems powerful enough.  I've printed out a few of the images on a Canon Pro9000 printer and they look good.Note, the HD video is 15 fps, which makes it stutter. It'll work in a pinch for HD filmmakers who always want an HD device in their pocket, but indoors, it can be grainy and has artifacts. If you actually want sound on your video, you MUST disable the AF, as it's always making a clicking noise while you're shooting.  So, either you forget about having decent audio or you set the camera to manual, infinity or \"pan\" focus prior to hitting \"record.\"  I've tried that on \"Infinity\" and that works for me.  To their credit, Pentax admits this sound issue a couple of times in the truly comprehensive manual.I was briefly tempted to return the W60 on the basis of these video limitations and exchange it for the Lumix FZ5a, which has 30 fps 720p and a longer optical zoom.However, the fact that this small camera is waterproof is just darn cool (particularly for those who like to kayak or hang out at the beach).  There are few options otherwise (the Olympus, or carrying around a waterproof case), and the W60's feature set is otherwise great.  So it really comes down to what compromises you're prepared to make.  Frankly, I love the freedom to shoot underwater or in the rain with this camera.  I'll live with the video limitations.

To me, it's pretty minor compared to the 840 SW... but still occasionally annoying enough that I will need another camera to do videos.The HD video is nice, but as someone else pointed out, the low 15 fps means that it isn't very smooth.I also find the lack of cover on the lens annoying since fingerprints get on it.Other then that, I do like that it can take pictures at very close distances, and the LCD viewer seems pretty clear to me.

It shares the same basic control layout and non-protruding zoom lens with the 43WR, but is missing a viewfinder (very useful for bright sun conditions) and rubbery padding of the camera body corners (see Pentax - Protective cover for digital photo camera - silicone - transparent).  I used my 43WR for fieldwork under wet, windy, and cold weather conditions and was always pleased with the photo quality.  I have yet to test the W60 under similarly poor conditions, but so far the photo quality is far superior.  I'm not sure the thinner W60 will provide the same degree of security in my hand as the 43WR under high wind conditions, but the full waterproofing will undoubtedly come in handy.

I got it shortly before the trip.  There is alot I really like about this camera and I was happy with the underwater photo quality given it was a point and shoot camera.  I used the video feature underwater on infinity and didn't have any camera noise as described by some others.However, the camera leaked a little (drops not flooding) and then would fogg up when taking surface pictures if it was sunny -- wrecking alot of my surface pictures.  I bought the camera through Amazon, and paid through Amazon, but it was apparently through an Amazon merchant who only had a 10-14 day return policy for defective merchandize (i.e. Ace Photo Digital).  That meant that by the time I got home from the trip, the merchant wouldn't take it back, even though it was defective on first use.  I thought I was covered by a 30-day Amazon A-Z return policy but that wasn't true. Now I'm being told I have to send it to Pentax for repairs.  I also see in the camera documentation that Pentax recommends sending it in each year for servicing to maintain the waterproofing.  Also something to consider if you want to use it in the water.So, be really careful if you buy this camera and intend to take it in the water that you give it a good testing in the water within the return period and that you check the \"sellers\" return period before you press buy.If the camera hadn't leaked I would have rated it 5 stars, or maybe 4 due to lack of lens cover, but being waterproof was kind of the point of geting this camera.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy it for water use", "Author": "tkvm", "ReviewID": "R2XOUMNEJEKYC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The short story, for you skimmers out there -- this camera's niche is its environmental sealing, permitting use at the beach and underwater.  If you are looking for such a camera, this is an excellent contender.  If you plan on staying dry (or sand, fog, dust, etc. free), I suggest you consider a number of alternative, similarly priced compacts, including offers by Canon, Sony, and Panasonic.The longer story -- we bought this camera for a trip to Maui during Thanksgiving week, 2008.  I wanted something better than the classic disposable one-use film camera for use at the beach, in the waves, and snorkeling.  After browsing several sites, I decided to buy the Pentax Optio W60.I have used digital cameras since 1999, including a variety of Sony and Canon compacts, and the Digital Rebel XTi.  I have also taught community courses on Digital Photography.  I had no illusions that this Pentax would provide the best photos I had ever seen, I just wanted to take it in the water.  Here are some points more specific to this camera:1.  The seals worked well, with a couple of issues.  First, the lens has no closing covering, as is common in other compacts, but rather a protective front window covering it.  In other words, you can always see the lens, even when the camera is turned off, and the front element protecting everything is glass.  I didn't realize this from the product photos.  It means that the protective window is exposed to dirt, scratches, etc.  On the other hand, it does keep the lens protected, and is easier to clean.  It also means that there is no lens extension when focusing or zooming (key to keeping water out).Secondly, I found that even in the light surf on Maui, the camera had a tendency to collect some sand (present in the ocean water) around the battery/SD card door.  The door is the primary defense against water intrusion, and has a large rubber plug inside that seals the hole upon closure.  No water or sand got into the camera, but there was so much sand in the mechanism around it that I could hardly get the door open because there was sand jamming it (you have to press a small lever with your thumb as you push the door to the side).  Upon finally getting it open in such circumstances, be careful not to get water/sand in the sealing surfaces or inside the battery compartment.  It will be tough to clean out.2.  The camera has awesome wide angle and telephoto range, 5x in total, with a very wide 28mm wide angle and a hefty 140mm telephoto.  Many compacts have a wideangle limit in the 35mm range.  The zoom range is evident from the specs, but is such a delight that I have to mention it.3.  The camera has both underwater photo and underwater movie modes, among many others that are accessed through a menu brought up by the bottom four-way button.  I used these for my snorkeling shots.  The camera often had difficulty focusing underwater, particularly when zoomed to telephoto.  I suspect that there were two problems, the low contrast of the scene, and sometimes material (such as a bit of sand or bubbles) floating in the water.  I suffered many unfocused shots until digging out the manual and looking up the manual focus option (there is one).  You will want to familiarize yourself with that trick, as it takes care of the problem and will give you a much better success rate.4.  The Pentax W60 has a nice movie resolution, but it has problems with the sound.  Perhaps because there needs to be a waterproof membrane protecting the microphone, the sound is horrible.  I mean absolutely pathetic.  It is almost impossible to hear normal speech levels at distances of more than a foot or two.  In addition, the camera provides the nice option of zooming and focusing while taking a movie.  However, the reason many other manufacturers lock the lens during movies is that the sound is easily picked up by the mic.  Sure enough, if you opt for zooming during movies, it will far exceed any other sound that the camera will pick up.  The conclusion is that you may get nice movies if you plan to put a soundtrack over them, but you do not want to use this camera for your child's birthday party, for example, where you would like to hear everyone sing \"Happy Birthday.\"Was I happy I bought it?

I was looking for something small I could take with me on my kayaking and skiing trips.  After doing a great flip and overturning in a kayak last year, I realized I will never relax unless my camera is waterproof.  At the same time, I am used to the quality of my Nikon SLR and Nikkor lenses -- I wasn't willing to go for a waterproof camera that makes poor images.I chose W60 based on its reviews after reading about all the other small waterproof cameras on the market.  I don't have a lot of experience with non-SLR cameras, so my expectations were pretty low.  Was I pleasantly surprised!  This thing makes spectacular images in non-tricky light conditions.  The pictures come out saturated and sharp.  What really amazes me is that exposure errors are pretty rare.  Most pictures look great and require very little processing.  Even in low/tricky light W60 often steps up and surprises me.  A non-trivial amount of images my W60 has produced go way beyond the \"fun\" camera range -- they are worthy of a photographic portfolio.I find this camera very easy to use.  Turns on very fast, controls are easy to navigate, even with my large fingers.I've also taken the camera with me on a snorkeling trip.  It held very well.  I made some really fun pictures while swimming.  Underwater results were not sharp, mostly because the water was choppy and I could not hold still.  However, I would not expect anyone to use this camera for serious underwater photography.  If you just want to capture some water fun in your photographs, and with pretty high quality in normal light -- W60 is for you.I am giving W60 four stars mostly for one reason -- barrel distortion in certain circumstances is too annoying.  If I could give 4.5 stars, I would.The bottom line -- if you are looking for a camera to take with you into water, if you are looking for a second camera to complement your SLR, if you are looking for a regular small camera to always take pictures with -- W60 delivers if you don't expect art gallery-quality pictures to come out of it.  I love this camera so much, a started carrying it around with me and using it actively when I am just out and about in NYC.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "See the Proof in the pudding!

Also considered the Olympus (rejected due to numerous reviews complaining of shutter lag) and the new Panasonic (too expensive).My first impression on opening the box was intensely negative.  The overall look and feel is not as jewel-like as a Canon or (especially) a Panasonic.  And the battery charger - totally unacceptable!!!  It's a huge clunky thing with a foot-long plug-in extension cord, literally about six times as bulky as Canon's standard folding prong charger.  Considering that people buy this thing to travel, and that it  retais for around $300, Pentax's blatant skimping on the charger is totally inexcusable.  It is reason alone to not buy this camera.Once I got over my disappointment, however, I found that the W60 actually functions pretty well.  The menus are clear and easy to understand, though some basic features, like the self timer, require too much button pushing.  (Also, while the W60's got a gazillion program modes, I found it pretty much impossible to make the darn thing stop down, as it consistently defaulted to a wide aperture and the  fastest possible shutter speed, even in \"landscape\" mode.)With all that said, I was pleasantly surprised by the the image quality.  The autofocus does a particularly decent job.  Most all my photos turned out crisp and clear and more or less properly exposed.  I was especially pleased with the underwater photos (taken down to about 15 feet).  They were a little murky straight off the card, but applying auto color correct (I used irfanview, but suspect any basic program will work equally well) caused the colors to really pop.  Video quality is also surprisingly good, especially in HD mode.So . . . my final verdict is that this camera does what it is supposed to do pretty darn well.  It's a little clunky, and the battery charger is a travesty, but if you're looking for a decent point and shoot that can be used in wet environments (and you don't want to spend $400 on the Panasonic), the W60 fits the bill.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Point & Shoot", "Author": "C.

The Pentax Optio W60 can record in 16:9 high definition with a frame rate of 15 fps and resolution of 1280x720. It has underwater picture and movie modes.With all the pluses, a couple things to note - the Pentax does not have an optical viewfinder and in bright sunny light on the water, even with its protective anti-reflective coating, it is sometimes difficult to see what you are filming through the LCD screen. Also, in movie mode, the zoom noise is recorded and can overshadow nature's sounds (see video review). Be sure to take extra batteries, as in movie mode, the battery lasts about an hour. My video review includes example first-time pictures and movies, but there are so many modes available for you to try after the initial shots. Selecting the correct mode is sure to improve your pictures.

Since rain sometimes happens, it needed to be waterproof (I was tired of fishing my old camera out of two zip-lock bags). I also wanted it to be small so it would fit in a life-vest pocket if I go kayaking. Finally, I wanted a wide-angle lens and good picture quality. The W60 did all that and has actually been more fun to use than I expected.It isn't absolutely perfect in every area, however, and there are several things you should know about the camera if you plan on getting it. If I hadn't, I probably would have been disappointed. Fortunately, none of them were surprises, and I've been able to work around them since I have a big SLR for when I don't need a camera in my pocket...1) no \"real\" shake reduction -- the digital version just bumps up the sensitivity and makes the pictures grainy, so I don't use it. I haven't missed it as much as I thought I would, but that may be because I have it on my SLR, which is what I use for long shots. Oddly (to me) the shake reduction for videos does work...2) noisy photos at high sensitivities. At ISO400 and above, photos are very grainy if they're underexposed. I've done some very nice stuff at ISO400 with plenty of light, but above that is awful. Still, for a little camera like this, that doesn't surprise me, so no big deal. Of course, it's made worse by...3) tiny flash. Like many small cameras, the flash is miniscule, and right next to the lens, which means short range and red-eye. In this case, the wide-angle lens can be the saving grace. If you use the wide angle setting on the lens, you're usually close enough to a small group of people for the flash to be sufficient and it lowers the chance of red-eye. Zooming in from across a dark room = bad shot, especially as I always forget to actually use the red-eye reduction feature. Since I usually use the camera outside, this hasn't been too bad for me, either.It may sound like those things are enough to cancel out the camera's good features, but they aren't. I've managed quite well with it, and I often find myself carrying to events where I would have carried my SLR simply because the trade of image quality vs convenience is in the W60's favor.Where this camera really excels is as a travel companion. It has a nice screen, good usability, and enough flexibility to keep me happy even in absence of a full manual mode.

I was rather torn on what to do. I was determined to find a camera that can go out into the wild and survive. Sadly, the only cameras that are compact and have a rugged design have refracting lenses, which tend to not have the best picture quality. The big push i had that made me order the Pentax is that my friend had a Olympus stylus 1000 and it took rather poor pictures and had even worse movie quality. Furthermore, i know Pentax and Casio have done a few deals with regards to lenses - i had a Casio Exilim Z600 that took amazing pictures so i gave the w60 a shotSo here is why i'm considering keeping it:-its water proof up to 13 feet! and it can stay underwater for over 2 hours-its stylish. Its nothing compared to my older casio exilim, but it has a nice body casing thats sleek looking-it has a 5x optical zoom and 28mm wide-angle lens-it takes 1280x720 video, a rare camera function. even though it is only 15fps, still this is a very valuable and uncommon feature.-outside it takes nice pictures, full of vibrant color-i like the green button that sets everything to auto/defaultHere's why i'm considering returning it-the camera has a cheap feel to it, it feels like a aluminum box filled with packing peanuts (don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a light camera, but it just feels like it isn't made well)-the picture quality in low lighting conditions is poor - i expected this in this style of camera, but it takes forever to focus, makes a lot of noise while focusing and then takes a severely poor and grainy picture-the camera claims that it has an image stabilizer, but it just manipulates the iso rating so you get a poor quality picture-the user interface is a joke! it is one of the most complicated menu systems i have ever encountered.-furthermore, the menu system (i.e. the icons and sounds) just seem foreign, as if Pentax decided to market its cameras in the US by slapping on English language text.-This is just a personal preference, but a camera should never meow. you can set the shutter sound, icon change sound, and power-up sound to mimic that of a cat's meowing - uh, no thank you.-there is no lens cover! There is no protection for the most import part of the camera - if you leave it face up in the sun, good luck on taking a picture. also the lack of a cover allows the lens to be easily scratched. I have a case for it, but this severely reduces its rugged like nature.-the battery feels just as cheap as the camera housing. it charged super fast (a good thing), its light (a good thing), and it discharges quickly (not a good thing)-the flash is poorly placed. its right below the spot where you hold your finger. the lens catches some of the reflection off of your finger. also it takes a bit of training to simply not cover the flash.I've traveled to Bestbuy to look at the olympus 1030sw and i like it better. i am afraid that it will have poorer picture quality. But i plan to buy my girl friend a nice camera that will take high quality pictures, so it might be in my best interest to buy a camera that can be dropped from 6 feet and stepped on, like the 1030sw. I'm disappointed that the olympus can only take 640x320, but i think its features overcome this flaw. Also the buttons to navigate the menu and options are laid out in a nicer orientation.I like the W60, its a nice camera with decent features. but when i spend that much money for the camera, i want a camera that i love.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Waterproof is a plus, almost everything else is a minus", "Author": "Eugene Y.

Casual tourist kayaking that you do on vacations, nothing hard core.Do not waste your money on this camera.  It is NOT waterproof.  It got condensation inside the very first time I took it out of the box and used it on a kayaking/snorkeling day trip.  I didn't do anything like drop it or anything out of the ordinary.  I bought the 1st and 2nd generation Optio cameras and they were both terrible too.  The pictures were out of focus, too dark, just crap, so I only used them when I needed the waterproof feature.  But then, they leaked!  After about a year or less, both would get condensation or full-on water drops inside rendering them useless as \"waterproof\" cameras.  I did not bother to send the two back because it wasn't worth the shipping costs (I was living out of the country to boot).  I received this 3rd one as a present and would have returned it but it had already cost $18 to ship it.  It seemed like a waste to spend another $18 to return it.  When I contacted Pentax for this 3rd one, they told me I had to pay to send it back for warranty service.  For a camera that broke on the first use, that's just ridiculous.

Sure you can hear the tap, tap when you zoom in, but that's no big deal.  I have tested the different modes on the same photo to see what works best and it varies depending on subject.  Night photos can be blurry sometimes when shooting distant photos, but if you can set the camera on a sturdy surface and put it on self portrait mode they usually come out pretty good.I've had the camera for about two years, and it still works great underwater -- no leaks.  There are only 2 issues I can find, which is probably due to my own camera skills.  One is when zooming in, the focus doesn't always catch up to the zoom so it can be blurry.  A pain when you are trying to take a quick shot that would be easy to miss (like a whale suddenly breaching the surface of the water).  But if I shut it off and on, or click to view photos and back to photo mode(which is quicker than turning it off), it generally falls in line.  The other issue is that when I download my photos onto a computer and I put my memory stick back into the camera and then try to scan through photos, some appear black and say I cannot look at them.... still not sure what that's about.  As long as I download and save my photos it's not a big deal, but if I wanted to show someone my photos from the camera it doesn't allow all of them to be seen -- could just be my memory stick -- so I will buy a new one this summer and update if I continue to have those issues.Overall: I still really like this camera alot and it still takes great photos in and out of the water, as well as video.

I am also disappointed that they changed the battery shape from the W10 -- I have perfectly good batteries from that camera, and had to buy new ones for this; not very environmentally friendly!The flash is weaker that it was in the W10; and it's now almost useless.

My suspicion is not that the focus mechanism itself is poor, but the algorithm that decides on where to focus picks the wrong item.About 4 weeks after I purchased the camera, the power switch failed.

I've had it three weeks and have taken approximately 1000 photos / movies with it. I bought this particular camera because it was waterproof, shock resistant, and had the largest mechanical zoom (5x) I could find.I have used the camera underwater in both fresh and sea water. Overall the camera takes good photos, though sometimes the color balance is off (particularly under backlit conditions). Also, the colors are sometimes flat underwater (green-blue in sea water, brown in fresh. Maybe it's just the water I was shooting in). There's no shake reduction, so photos can be blurry (there's some sort of post-shot blur reduction, but I haven't used it).Photo quality is okay, but not spectacular. In my opinion, the camera has more megapixels than the lens warrants. I have no complaints, but if you want REALLY sharp photos, you probably want to look at something with a bigger/better lens. The close-up function, especially the 1cm macro setting, can take some amazing pictures. I got an 8gb card, which is big enough for my use.I've used the camera in ares with extremely fine beach sand. None got in the camera (that I can tell), but some did get in the slide track for the battery / card cover, and had to be cleaned out (I could get it out with my finger nail). No troubles, but the slot did accumulate some and made the cover slide a little rough.So far the shock resistance has been adequate. I missed a hand-off, and the camera got dropped from about 4 feet onto rough concrete with no noticeable damage.I was a bit concerned that using the camera in fast-flowing water would cause the seals to leak, but no problems so far.I like the menu system for different shooting modes. It uses both an icon and a short text description, which not only helps you remember what the icons mean, but helps you get the right one if you're shooting in the sun and the screen is hard to read. There are some of the modes I'll probably never use, but there aren't so many that it's annoying. I find the buttons big enough to use.Batter life isn't great. If you're really using the camera (i.e., on most of the time), my experience is you get about half a day on the battery that comes with it. Larger capacity batteries are available. I've ordered one, but haven't picked it up yet.Some little things -- the wrist strap didn't come with a cinch, something I found essential for not losing the camera in big waves or fast streams. The screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight (the same as other digital cameras I've used). The microphone isn't great quality (no surprise for such a small camera), and when you zoom during underwater movies, you can hear the click of the zoom button. Not a problem for me, but it might irritate some people. The manual says that to maintain waterproofness, you should replace the seals once a year, but it's not obvious where you get them or how to do it. I find the charger painful to pack; the cord and battery holder unit are essentially as big as the camera. Something that fit with the camera inside a small camera bag would have been nice. The way it is, you have to pack them separately. I have not used other underwater cameras, but I have found that if you use this one underwater and then above water, you can sometimes get a few drops of water stuck in the corner of the lens that blur your above-water shot.Knowing what I know now, I would definitely buy this camera again.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "fails to turn on", "Author": "Rick Hudson", "ReviewID": "R3857UFLTPQOZM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera erratically fails to turn on.

There are a few downsides (some that come as part of the design):Downsides:- slow lens means blurry, often noisy shots in low light- flash is really underpowered, relies on increasing sensitivity to reach more than a few feet = noisy shots- slow autofocus (really takes much longer than a Canon P&S;)- some slow operation (like zooming into a shot in playback)Upsides:- nice design, solid build quality (though below some canon metal P&S;)- decent screen, easy to see- good movie quality (1280x720 even at only 15fps)- decent picture quality in good lightRemember, this is a waterproof camera, it is not as good as many normal camera (partially due to design limitations, partially due to Pentax not being on top of the game). Decide for yourself if you can live with it, but if you NEED a WATERPROOF camera, I don't think there is a better choice (maybe the new Canon might be better, but not the Olympus or Fuji models).For the people that complained about the AF noise and Zoom noise during movie recording: yes, this is a limitation, but I don't know any camera that doesn't have this. Neither Canon, Olympus nor Panasonic P&S; allow optical zoom during movie, so at least pentax gives you the option. Many cameras also don't use AF during the movie mode (i.e. Panasonic).

I wanted a pocket camera for the fishing trips and the everyday travel and the W60 proves to be great for both.  One way I can attest to the water tightness is video taping with it in 4 feet of river on the end of a fishing line after which this camera is still working.  Hence this camera begs to be played with, it wants you to push it to the max in your outdoor picture taking while still holding its own at the tame birthday party. There are plenty of modes for picture taking with two of my favorites being the pana mode and a two shot wide area mode.  Both of these are great for travel and I find myself using them alot.  I also like the macro focus which has produced some great shots for me. But there are the things I don't like about the W60.  The first is the battery and its life. I wished tha Pentax would have made a battery which has more power and could be replaced with something that could be purchased in a store for back up usage.  As it satnds now I would suggest you buy a second battery for your trips with this camrea and you still may want to take a charger.

The only thing is, there is only a small piece of glass that appears to be protecting the lens and when the camera is turned off, there is no protection built in for this glass piece. I am worried that if I toss the camera into my purse or with my snorkelling gear, the glass will scratch and affect picture quality. It does not come with a case, so I am using a cell phone style \"sock\" to keep the camera from being damaged.As well, the flash is a little close to the lens and it's easy to accidently cover it with your fingers while taking a shot.

I'd give it five stars, but it isn't quite a \"perfect\" product.  The bad?  Relatively little: so-so battery life, HD movies are a little choppy, low light focus and noise could be better.  The good?  Pretty much everything else by my book: really weatherproof, pretty decent image quality, HD movies, multiple aspect ratios, uses standard SD cards, easy to use and access functions... I could go on.It was wonderful to have a pocketable camera that I didn't fear taking with me into the ocean, diving into cenotes, dropping on the sand, etc, etc.  In the end I found I used it far more than my K10D, and I'm very glad I bought it: for it's intended purpose it far exceeded my expectations.

G. nelson", "ReviewID": "R3OJ1DELYWEYEP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having owned a previous Pentax water camera I had high hopes for this very high priced and high feature new edition. My old Pentax was only a 2 MP camera but had a more rugged body and actually took good overall pictures. To bad after 4 years it finally died. After searching and comparing I decided to go again with Pentax. Those who have said that it is only average or below average for general pictures are correct; so, please take those opinions seriously. I don't know if the Olympus 1030w or 1050w are any better for picture quality, but this cameras standard use of sd card and internal lens use made me choose this camera. While not a professional, I have considerable experience with film and digital camera's and picture taking. I would recommend this camera if you had special outdoor needs, snorkeling, pool, or in the wet outdoors. It is nice not to have to worry about the camera. I tested this camera for 3 months and will be keeping it. However, I will be buying an all purpose camera (less than $200) for general use hoping to get better pictures. I wonder if the Olympus 1030w is a better camera still?I bought from Amazon; the service was very good and would recommend buying a camera this way. However, if you think you may not like this camera or are unsure, then buy local with a good return policy. pro: good water pictures which you would expect. Battery life is terrible but at least it is rechargeable. You will need to buy at least 1 replacement if not 2. Simple to use, but to use more advance features need to read the manual. con: low light situations even with flash very poor pictures; grainy and noisy. Major, not minor, light distortion at the 28 mm setting if any light comes in from the side. Yes, I can use the 35 mm setting, and do, but why should I have to for a camera that cost $300. Does not handle non standard light situations very well. I use software post picture to correct lots of the color distortions. Someone recently took pictures at a party that I took pictures at. They had an inexpensive Kodak and I took pictures with this; theirs are much better for color saturation.Suggest you buy one of the specials or kits that comes with a charger and at least 1 spare battery. Also, I bought a neoprene clear cover which is needed to protect the camera, it is all metal and not as rugged as the Olympus or the old ones. But, this is not a problem, I would recommend it with all camera's today. 2 or 4 gig non special SD card should be sufficient.Good luck and hope this and the other opinions help you decide", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Single purpose camera", "Author": "M.

I bought the W60 specifically for this vacation to complement a Canon G7 + underwater housing for snorkeling and photo op events. I am trying to add some real perspective to the vast amount of very subjective reviews, this one being no different.If this is your only camera for occasional underwater photos, it is a true companion. It beats by any strength of imagination all the remaining 35mm 400 ASA cheap plastic enclosed (and oversized) cameras available. You're already spending a fortune on air travel, accommodations, food, souvenirs, etc., so make the memories and last and don't mind the $300+ bucks for this camera. The Pentax is equally well positioned for all your holiday photos and it comes in a small handy package. It's the perfect travel companion in your back pockets. But that's it.Underwater, the W60 has a decent quality to it. Photo quality is sharp but a little less low contrast (contrast, saturation settings can be changed). Close up images are superior, focusing is quick and easy. If you want quantities of decent photos, the camera get's you there very quickly. I would not expect high-gloss tourist guide book under water pics. For that you will need scuba gear and $5000 worth of photo gear anyway.Comparing the W60 image quality to my true and tried Canon G7 + housing, it's day, and somewhat night. The Pentax is not too far off. I have taken better pics with the Canon, but at the expense of a much bulkier setup and a slower response for focus and shutter release. When snorkeling, I take one or the other, both are producing satisfying results.I have no second thoughts taking this camera anywhere, from the ocean beaches, mountain hiking, ski vacation, to the desert heat (last two are not tried, but I plan..)Positives: smallest package for underwater snapshots. Lot's of options. Fast response. Fast shutter release. Good battery life (one charge is fine for a typical Hawaii day, including pool photos and review of the day's results). Goes anywhere without adding backpack real estate.Negatives: (when compared to Canon G7). Low contrast. Slight blue tinge underwater (no surprise). Outdoor photos: less nuances, whites are washed out.

I was sold on it's specs, not too mention it is waterproof.After receiving the camera and trying it out, I became quite disappointed rather quickly.Poor indoor picture quality.No zoom buttons on top of the camera, they are on the back.The flash is too close to where your finger rests, therefore, when the flash fires it can reflect red light off your finger; and since the lens does not extend it captures that reflection.5x optical zoom was nice, but the autofocus did not keep up with far away action shots.Thanks Amazon for the easy return procedure.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "N C \"np\"", "ReviewID": "RSBGN8I11PER5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this camera.
