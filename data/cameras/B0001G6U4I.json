{"Reviews": [{"Title": "nice lightweight camera, lives up to the canon name.", "Author": "Hugh Dunnit \"Dionysus\"", "ReviewID": "RIH6H8NI8J24B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an owner of two other canon cameras (G2 & S50) I'm obviously pleased with the products they put out. When I decided to look for a smaller lightweight anytime camera I again went with canon. I did look at nikon, fuji, and sony, who all had nice features but for the money and options this camera looked best. After playing with it for a bit I'd have to say the point and shoot pictures are very good--outside. the load up time is short, and I can simply snap away without a problem. The pictures come out very bright and clear for a 3.2mp camera--some nice stuff. Now when taking pictures inside, the story is a lot different..the flash drains serious battery power (a310 takes AA or nimh rechargables) and takes close to 30 seconds to 'recharge' before you can take another picture. Luckily I don't plan on using this inside much, but if you are this is definitely something to be worried about. The lens is fixed, but there is a 5x digital zoom that works pretty well between 3-4x once you get to 5x its very grainy. Size is good, it's about the same size as my s50 but much lighter, the power-on mechanism is the same, using the front lens cover as the switch. it's rather secure compared to the s50, i don't feel that it will open up accidently often. To wrap this up, my overall feeling is that I'm pleased with the purchase, the battery life is short, my first set of AA batteries died in about 45 minutes, the features are good, the pictures come out nice and the video option works fine. indoor pictures aren't so hot, but if you change the ISO speed and exposure you can pull off decent pictures with or without the flash. It's a great camera!", "Date": "April 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice entry to digital photography", "Author": "Chris Broderick", "ReviewID": "R2TG197HMUSWP2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter because it is inexpensive and easy to use, and it's been a lot of fun. You will be hard pressed to find a better 3.2 megapixel camera for the money. Picture quality is excellent, operates on two AA batteries (get rechargables with a recharger because battery life is short), downloads your photos in seconds to your computer through a USB cord that comes with the camera, has a zoom (the 5x max zoom is not sharp; you are better off cropping and enlarging a non-zoom photo image on the computer), the flash is decent, and the features are functional. My daughter loves it. I have been a confirmed film camera purist and still prefer my Nikon with its hefty 28-210 zoom to a pixel image, but why lug that around when we have this little pocket wonder?

Okay, having no optical zoom is definetely a setback, but all of its other nice features make up for it, still giving it 5 stars. It uses only 2 batteries, and doesn't weigh a ton. Also, the sliding lens cover makes it a bit more durable than other cameras without one. But my favorite feature is the movie mode. How can anybody argue with a camera this small, this cheap, with movie mode?", "Date": "June 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great product for a great price", "Author": "oldsoup", "ReviewID": "R1ZE3W486LT8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good camera for a good price, and found the a310. Since I don't need great photos, even though this camera gives great photos, it's great. All the controls are very user friendly; you can switch from camera mode to movie taking mode with a mere switch, which brings me to the movie taking ability. Of course, you can't expect a great movie capability, but this camera sure covers what I need. With a decent sized card, you can get a whole lot of movies. However, on the highest resolution, you can only take movies up to 30 seconds long, which is okay for me since most movies longer than that get boring. I use a 512mb card, and can get about 450 seconds of high resolution video(30 seconds each)and more than 1000 seconds on medium. on low resolution....wow. I find myself using the movie capability more than the pictures. If you're starting out in photography, or just want a decent camera for a great price, you've found it.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Camera", "Author": "John Zelewsky", "ReviewID": "R3J611XURNK4RB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on a friend's advice. I have been very happy with it. It is packed with loads of features. I find it easier to use than my old point and shoot analog camera. The only drawbacks are, battery life, and the small CF card it comes with. I bought a 512mb card which allows me 300+ pics on the highest setting. I also bought re-chargable NiMH batteries which give me about 200 pics before they need to be replaced.", "Date": "December 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a great price!", "Author": "Mary Poppins \"markymark\"", "ReviewID": "R3A9EQZ43P6H6V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was very excited to finally receive this camera through mail. Tried it out but was amazed of how quickly the included batteries died. Nothing major that rechargeable NIMH batteries couldn't fix. Loved the quality of the pics, but even loved it more when i figured out how to set it on the Superfine setting. The sliding lense cover both acts as a protective cover and the power switch which makes it very easy to use. The included USB cable and power adapter makes transfers to the computer an easy process. My favorite feature on this camera though, is the video mode with sound! The lag between each shot with the flash on is pretty aggravating though. Overall, This camera performs very well for the price and I take it everywhere I go!", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera", "Author": "P. J.

Since she didn't use it, she gave it to me.  I love it.  I have never had a problem with my batteries draining to fast, but I do always carry spares.  (Mainly thats because I've had my batteries die in my other cameras when I needed them.)  My biggest love of this camera is the Canon name and their service department.  Two weeks ago I had a bottle of water leak in my backpack, and of course my camera was drenched.  It quit working immediately and I went into a panic.  When I got home from work, I went to the Canon website and emailed their service department and explained what happened.  Within 30 minutes they had returned an email to me with options on either fixing it for a base price of $79 with options if more service was needed.  Or upgrade to a refurbished Canon A400 for $75.  I decided to take the flash card out along with the batteries and let it air dry overnight.  The next morning I popped everything back in and (yippee!) everything works like a charm.  I think this camera is great.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, but LCD issue confirmed by canon", "Author": "HKC", "ReviewID": "RJAX0PTSHOSIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this as our first digital camera experience when we had a baby 4 years ago.  Considerably higher priced then, but well worth the usage.  Easy for beginer, but photo quality of expert.

The 3.2MP is perfect for 4x6s, I've printed some 8x10s and they've come out fine as well and they don't take up a lot of room on my computer. The colors are vivid and the settings easy to use. I found that photos without the flash turned out best (I think this is true of most cameras, even the digital SLRs have flash issues). The video option was particularly useful, although it only allows video in 30 second clips I found this was often the best option as I could stitch videos into a montage rather than a long string of video (which I find boring).The best thing about the camera was its durability. It's been across three continents in a backpack, dropped from a window, dropped in the ocean, and survived years in a messenger bag at college. It only recently stopped working after a day trip, so I'm looking for a new Canon, but still giving this one an excellent review.

I have bought 3 till date for me and my family. There are people out there to criticize it for faults like No optical zoom but these are functionalities of the camera that are specified in the Description, so if they haven't read them before buying it then its their fault. Its not that it malfunctions after u buy it or the Optical zoom capability disappears after one purchases it, so please think before criticizing such as excellent product.This product from Canon may go down as a Classic. Its photographs are mind blowing and videos are crystal clear. Ive dropped the camera from my pocket while jogging onto solid Tar and it came out unscathed.
