{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good Camera with Flaws", "Author": "Yang Wang", "ReviewID": "RAZW69DIDM49N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few years ago Thom Hogan posted a \"Compact Camera Challenge\" ([...]) in his excellent blog, in which he lamented the lack of compact cameras with a large sensor. Despite the development of digital photography technology for the past two decades, stated Hogan, \"the camera makers simply don't have any idea of what many of their customers really want.\" In Hogan's view, consumers will be well served if there was a compact camera with a larger sensor that met certain standards he deemed essential for a serious photographer.I stumbled onto Hogan's challenge as I was looking for the same thing. And since that time I have been waiting and hoping for such a camera. I use a DSLR (Canon EOS 10D and EOS Xti) almost exclusively, but grow tired of lugging the camera and those heavy lenses on each trip as well as the lens changing for those casual outings. The end result is that I now don't bother to even bring a camera with me on some of my trips. I know there are those mirror-less cameras, but the prospect of buying a whole new set of lenses and change them during shooting had discouraged me from jumping into them.The Canon Powershot G1X is exactly the camera I have been waiting for. It has in fact exceeded all the criteria laid out in Hogan's challenge. So I immediately bought it, even though the $800 price tag is on the high side.After playing around with it in the past few days I have gained a better picture of what this camera is (and isn't). I'm still very pleased with it. In the mean time I also feel that depending on what you use your camera for and what your level of enthusiasm is, there might be better alternatives. I'll try to summarize what I have found below in more details.1. Image Quality (Sensor). The greatest strength of this camera is its ability to take SUPERB quality images. The lens is very sharp. The quality of images taken under low light situation (which is pretty much the case if you take indoor pictures) is UNSURPASSED by any other compact camera. I have shot several images at ISO 3200, something I had never done even with my DSLR, and the images are completely usable. In fact, up to ISO 1600 the noise level is negligible. Numerous reviews have confirmed this experience. You can find various sample images online, including a large number of them on DPReview. You may also find some of  images I have taken at[...]2. Lens Quality. So far I'm very pleased with it. It is a very sharp lens. The 28-115mm zoom is practical for most shooting situations. I find the lens to be very sharp overall. However, at the widest setting of 28mm the barrel distortion is quite evident --- in fact it is very pronounced. If you shoot in JPEG at 28mm the images looks far less distorted because it has been corrected in the camera firmware. Of course, this means you do see some softness away from the center of the frame. But when you shoot in raw and open it in Photoshop (after converting it to Adobe dng format), you see the pronounced distortion. This is something most of the \"official\" reviews have missed.The lens, other than at its widest setting, is quite slow. I do understand that this is a limitation of the compactness of this camera.3. Features. As an advanced compact camera, like other Powershot G-series cameras, the G1X comes with all kinds of user controls that are essential for enthusiasts. I will not go into details. DPReview ([...]) has just posted its full review of the camera, and many features are discussed there. There are also a number of features that people who don't care for user controls will find intriguing. For example, there is a \"smile detection\" setting that will take three pictures automatically if it detects a smile. I have tested this feature, and it seems to work fine. If you want a camera packed with features that suit both novices and professionals, the G1X will not disappoint you. I highly recommend one to go through the full manual (downloadable from Canon website) to get to know all the features.4. Focus. The G1X has been criticized by just about every review for its slow autofocus. But I find this to be an overreaction. I certainly have not noticed that the focus is slow or inaccurate. If anything, I find it to be quite good. Sure it is no match for an SLR, but I have used many compact cameras, and the G1X stacks up pretty well. In lab testing the G1X is slower than the state of the art compact cameras by a fraction of a second on average, but to most people, even seasoned professionals, I don't believe this is an issue. The G1X also has a very useable manual focus, conveniently controlled with a dial and viewed on the LCD with a digital \"magnifying glass.\"A bigger problem is its inability to focus in close range, so one must often switch between normal focus and macro focus modes. Fortunately this is not so difficult for the G1X.5. Macro. Like everyone else had said, this is not made for it.6. Usability/Performance. The controls are a mixed bag. In some cases they are well designed. I like the exposure compensation dial, making exposure compensations a cinch. The various exposure modes are rather conventional. However, I find myself often inadvertently touching a button and mess up the setting I had. This is extremely annoying. Some of the features take a little practice to get used to. Overall, the usability is good although not exceptional.If you plan to use this camera to do mainly landscape or scenes that are not moving, such as shooting friends who will pose for you with their contrived smiles, this camera will not disappoint you. I would highly recommend this camera. However, if you are into sports photography this camera is DEFINITELY NOT for you. In fact, even for photographing kids this camera is woefully inadequate, and I say you should forget it. The main problem is that it takes very long to go from one shot to the next. In my test with a moderately fast SD card, shooting in raw+JPEG it takes a whopping 6.5 seconds for the camera to be ready for the next shot (the figure is about 4 seconds in JPEG only, or with a very fast SD card). This is completely UNACCEPTABLE. I don't know why no major reviews had pointed it out. Note that even after 6.5 seconds you will still need to tack on another few seconds to compose your next shot and press the shutter. So overall, from one shot to the next can take 8 seconds easily, which for many photographers is an eternity.6. Movie/HD Video. I don't use this feature much so I don't have anything extensive to say. On a cursory examination it is quite good.7. Battery. The battery is small, and it gives you about 250 shots. Please be sure to buy one or two extra ones. You can find them on eBay for a fraction of the cost Amazon charges (I bought two for about 7 bucks).My overall verdict on Powershot G1X is that it is a GREAT camera (with some minor flaws) if you are photographing mainly landscape or people who will pose for you. However, it is completely unsuited for sports, and it is poorly suited for photographing kids or spontaneous scenes because of its ridiculously long lag between shots.======================================================Update:I have just taken the Powershot G1X to Xian, China, to photograph the Terra Cotta Warriors and artifacts in the Shaanxi History Museum. The lighting condition was not ideal at all. In most cases it was very dark. Only in the Terra Cotta Pit 1 the lighting was not extremely dark. I took about 250 photos in those two places. In several places I had to push the ISO to 3200 and use a shutter speed of 1/20th of a second. In the end, almost all images came out tack sharp with little noise! The IS worked superbly. I must say the overall quality of my pictures has gone far beyond my expectation. In fact I went with a friend who carried the latest Sony full frame DSLR, and my G1X held up very well. As far as image quality goes, it does not disappoint.However, the battery life was really not so great. While Canon claims 250 pictures per charge, I got about 170 (LCD on). So make sure you get at least two extra batteries (on ebay).", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "You will love the photos from the G1X", "Author": "E. Lacey", "ReviewID": "R2FAJREE9YOFRE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When you pick up the Canon G1X, your first thought will probably be \"Wow-- this thing is SOLID.\"  There is a lot of glass and high quality components stuffed inside this little package, and it all adds up to SUPER photos.  This camera is a terrific addition to a photographer's arsenal.  It is a perfect companion camera to have when you do not want to tote around your DSLR and all of the accessories that comes with that.  But, do not think that this is a pocket-sized camera-- while it will fit into a large coat pocket, you will likely be wearing this camera around your neck when you have it out for your day of shooting.The G1X takes incredibly good photos.  It rivals my Canon 60D in that regard.  Its low-light sensitivity is top notch for a camera this size, due mainly to the fact that the sensor is nearly as large as the 1.6 crop sensors in many consumer/prosumer DSLRs.  I get great photos at ISO 1600, and usable photos all the way up to ISO 6400.  (Note that if you shoot RAW, then you will not get as great photos until you apply noise reduction in your software of choice.)This camera also supports full 1080P digital recording, although I have not yet had a chance to put that through its paces, so I cannot yet comment on the quality and ease of use.  However, from the little that I have done, it seems very good.  You can record at different aspect ratios (e.g. 16x9), you can zoom while recording, and the camera has a built-in \"wind\" noise filter.In addition to the standard set of \"creative modes\" (portrait, landscape, kids & pets, sports, night, beach, underwater, foliage, snow, fireworks, face-detect) that come with digital cameras these days, the G1X also has numerous digital affects built in such as HDR, miniature, toy camera, fish eye, nostalgic, among others.  Additionally, the G1X can also be operated 100% automatically or 100% manually, or somewhere in between, allowing you to shoot in (P)rogram mode, Av, Tv, and M.  In my opinion, the camera performs best when you take over most of the decision making.  Like most cameras, this camera does not do its best work in 100% Automatic mode.The knocks on this camera, and the reason it does not get 5 stars from me, are its sluggish auto focus, its poor view finder, and its relatively high price. While the auto-focus is a bit slow, I think it compares reasonably to other compact cameras in this price range, especially if you do use a creative mode so the camera \"knows\" what to look for in your scene.  However, if you want to spend a bit more, you can still get superior performance from something like the Fuji X100.  The optical view finder is nearly useless-- you cannot see what the camera is focusing on and the lens obstructs the lower left-hand corner of the view, even when not zoomed.  For these reasons, I quickly abandoned using it altogether.  Another knock would be the Macro capabilities of the G1X, or lack thereof.  While there is a Macro shooting mode, the minimum focusing distance required does not allow you to get anything near Macro images.  As far as the price is concerned, the quality warrants the price, but the shortcomings take away from the perceived value.  The same camera at $599 would be a no-brainer.  Fix the auto-focus speed, viewfinder, and macro ability and charge the $799 and it is also a no-brainer.  As it is, you will have to decide if the features warrant the price for yourself.If you are deciding whether or not to purchase the G1X or a DSLR, I would opt for a DSLR unless your #1 concern is size.  The DSLR will offer much more customization that the G1X.  However, if you are looking for a camera that allows you to leave your DSLR at home, but still gives you fantastic photos and allows you full control, then this camera may be exactly what you are looking for.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for everyone but ...", "Author": "David L. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2YSBJ6WM9H0QB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want GREAT IQ this is it.  MY G1X came in on 2-9-2012 and have taken over 1000 pics with it.  If you want a FAST camera then its not for you, the focus is not fast but it does the job, I would not call it slow.  Shot to shot is slow and dont even talk about macro.  I have a 7D for speed and macro but the funny thing is the G1X has as good if not better IQ at high iso it really is that good.The 4 stars and not 5 is for the speed of focus and MFD.  I do weddings and portraits and this is now my backup camera to my 7D.  Its far from perfect but the reason for a camera is the picture and for this its very very good.  The video is good and it will focus while in video mode, you can also zoom in video and its nearly silent.  I use raw with my 7D but I am finding that may not be needed with the G1X the jpg's out of the camera are as good as I can get with LR4.  The lens hood will not fit the G1x reversed, I use a Lowepro Apex 100aw.  It will hold the Gx with the lens hood attached.Dave4/16/2012Adding data on frame rate.  Did a bit of testing on how fast you can take continuous shoots.  All testing was done while shooting at a clock for 10-11 sec and then counting the number of pictures taken.  Also tested with int and ext flash.AV mode, auto white bal,4:3 large jpg, DR off, 28mm 1/60 @ 2.8.no flash:Single shot ~ 5 / 10  about 5 shots in 10 sec, frame rate = (shots - 1) / time = 0.4 shots / sec, 2.5 sec / shotCont-with focus ~ 8 / 10 = 0.7 & 1.43Cont-no focus ~ 18 / 10  = 1.7 & 0.59int flashSingle shot ~ 4 / 11Cont-with focus ~ 7 / 10Cont-no focus ~ 13 / 11ext flash 320exSingle shot ~ 4 / 10Cont-with focus ~ 7 / 10Cont-no focus ~ 17 / 10Beause of the faster operation in cont/focus I have changed to that as my std.  I would rather have extra shots then miss one.  This also shows the huge advantage with an ext flash in faster shooting.  The problem with cont/focus is the the screen is black for about 80% of the time :(Dave6/11/2102  In my view the 320EX is to big a flash for the G1X, its bigger then the camera.  I picked up a 270EXII last week and really like it on the G1X, I think the size is a better match.  I wanted to pass on one thing I found that is nice, the 270EXII with Eneloop's in cont-no focus mode the flash would keep up with the camera as fill light AV mode. I stopped at 32 shots with no delay from the flash.  Will add more as I do more testing.  I think that most people know that an ext flash helps because of the bounce feature but there are a few other good reasons for an ext flash.  One that I like is it has its own battery so you dont use the camera battery. Another is the remote flash you can do with the 270EXII.  One more little thing, the Video Light on the 320ex will work in the auto mode with the G1X.  It will turn on when needed in a video and it wont turn off till the end of the video, so it wont be flashing on and off.Dave8/31/2012  Wanted to add some data on SD cards.  The G1X does NOT support UHS1 sd cards, it can still use a UHS1 card but will not be as fast as the card is rated for.  To test this I used a Scandisk Extreme Pro 95 MB/s sd card and had only a 10% better frame rate then the Amazon basics 16g sd class 10 card.  I also tested card speed in two different card readers one an older model USB2 and NO UHS1 support, the Scandisk Extreme Pro only did 20MB/s with this reader and the Amazon basics did 17.  In a new USB3 & USH1 (USpeed Y3201) reader the Scandisk Extreme Pro did 86MB/s and the Amazon basics did 18.Dave", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot G1 X: Currently The Finest Advanced Compact Camera, Especially for Low-Light/High-ISO Photographs", "Author": "Lawrence H.

It is not the nicest-looking (best styled) compact camera (in my opinion, the best looking are the Fujifilm X100 12.3 MP APS-C CMOS EXR Digital Camera with 23mm Fujinon Lens and 2.8-Inch LCD and the Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only). Nor is it the most prestigious. And it is definitely NOT a replacement or a substitute for a DSLR camera.If it is not any of these things, then what is it?It is, in my opinion, simply the best designed, the best performing, and the most advanced compact digital camera on the market today and is, again in my opinion, the very finest such camera yet made.Many people, such as myself, do not want an interchangeable-lens camera for various reasons (including the expense, the inconvenience, and necessity to carry about a rather large array of camera equipment).Yet some of those people, including myself, want an advanced, highly capable, camera with a high-quality lens, a large sensor, and the ability to take pictures under many varied conditions (including low-light without flash) and have those pictures turn out exactly the way they'd like. In other words, they want pictures the equal of those produced by most DSLRs - and they (and I) want to be able to achieve this quality 'in-camera' rather than having to use computer software afterwards.There is really no technical reason why such a camera couldn't have been made before but it appears that this one is the first that can actually achieve that goal.As a preamble, I encourage you to read EVERY review of this camera which appears on Amazon, as well as all of the comments thereto. Plus I also suggest that you read reviews on other sites (including the 'professional' reviews). After all, this is a very expensive camera and you want to make certain that you have obtained every bit of information available to you before you buy it.Here on Amazon you will see almost as many 'con' reviews and comments as 'pro' ones.Some writers feel it is too expensive for what you get. Some writers feel it has too many disadvantages, one way or another. Many of the writers, very obviously, do not truly know how to use it. And there are some people who just don't like it.Some reviewers have purchased the camera and returned it after just a short period of ownership. Frankly, I believe that they did not learn to properly use it. This is a very advanced camera and learning it will take a lot of time. A couple of weeks won't do.There are also a few reviewers here who, while praising the camera for its abilities, are nevertheless somewhat negative in tone; these appear to be written by people who own DSLR cameras and are looking for a more convenient alternate to be used at certain times.Unfortunately, it appears to me (and I could be wrong of course) that they want a compact fixed-lens camera which has EXACTLY the same types of design, features, and, especially, controls of their interchangeable-lens camera.It 'ain't' going to happen!I do want to say that all of these people's opinions are, of course, just as valid as mine and are to be respected (and you'll surely want to consider them) - but I disagree with them all.To begin with, this is a very sophisticated and complicated instrument. In order to derive the maximum benefit from its capabilities, you must be very familiar with the technical fundamentals of photography - or be willing to learn them. Otherwise, if you're not going to teach yourself to use it to its maximum advantage, why pay $800.00 for this camera? If you don't want to take the time to learn these things, feeling perhaps that the effort in obtaining this knowledge is too time-consuming for you personally, or if you just want to take ordinary snapshots and don't really need the capabilities of an advanced camera, in my opinion, you could and should buy a much less expensive one which will suit your needs.This camera would definitely not be for you and I say that without meaning to be disrespectful to anyone.If you're still interested, however, I want to tell you right now that this is a VERY long review and, while I do apologize for its length, I hope you will read all of it to understand what I personally like in a camera, why I particularly like and recommend this one, and why I feel that it is worth every penny I paid for it.Ten years ago, I bought a Canon PowerShot G2 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom which, at the time, was one of the best cameras available. It had many good features; it had a nice, bright f/2.0 - 2.5 maximum aperture across its 3:1 zoom ratio but it also had some disadvantages. For example, the smallest f-stop was only f/8 - this, to me, was unsatisfactory (I had not seen that particular specification listed anywhere; had I known about that minimum f-stop, I might not have bought the camera!). In addition, the maximum shutter speed was only 1/1000 second and the ISO range was from 50 to only 400. In other words, this camera did not offer a high dynamic range. As a result of these disadvantages, I missed a number of pictures I would have liked to have had. In addition, it had only 4.0 mega-pixels; though high at the time I bought it, today only cell-phones offer that little.Since that time I have been looking for something better but I had no luck until now. Every camera I saw (including other models in the Canon PowerShot G line) had various disadvantages which precluded my consideration of them.I want a fixed-zoom-lens camera with a wide range of ISO settings (the equivalent of slow-to-fast films), the ability to take good, noise-free (\"grain-free\") pictures at high ISOs (sensitivities) so I can take low-light pictures without using flash, a relatively fast lens which can also stop down to at least f/16, and the ability to take pictures in a wide range of shooting modes (automatic, manual, etc). In other words, I want a camera which has most of the capabilities of a DSLR but without the need to change lenses.When I read about the Fujifilm X-100, it seemed to be very good but it is clearly out of my price range (as is the Leica - but I can always dream). In addition, though it has a large APS-C-sized sensor (the same as in DSLRs and even larger than the G1 X) and its lens is fast (f/2.0), it is fixed focal length only (no zoom) and it has only a 12.3 mega-pixel sensor (a relatively low figure at its price by today's standards) and, while, if the camera were in my price range, I could accept all of that, most importantly, according to \"Popular Photography's,\" test results, its measured noise figures are mediocre, even at only moderately high ISO settings. I am afraid that that is something I do not want to accept.There are several Sony cameras which have good noise figures at high ISOs but they have too many other disadvantages, at least for me, to consider them. In addition, though I'm sure that this is not representative, I personally know TWO people whose expensive Sony cameras 'died' shortly after the warranty expired - and Sony would do nothing for them. Please note that I'm sure this is an anomaly - I own many Sony products though not cameras - and I have never had problems with any of them; nonetheless, though I'm certain that most Sony camera owners are completely satisfied, these people's experiences has left a sour taste in my mouth for Sony's cameras.The Fujifilm X10 12 MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera with f2.0-f2.8 4x Optical Zoom Lens and 2.8-Inch LCD, which was introduced recently, IS in my price range and, as soon as I saw it, I put it into my Amazon Wish List.However, when \"Popular Photography\" reviewed it in the March 2012 issue and I saw the rather dismal high-ISO noise figures listed for the camera, fast lens or no, I immediately removed it from my Wish List. (I have been reading \"Popular Photography\" for over fifty years now and I have learned to trust their test figures implicitly.)Please note that I am sure that the X10 is a fine camera and will please all who buy it but it does not fulfill my requirements. (However, you should keep in mind that the Fujifilm X10 does cost two hundred dollars less than the Canon G1 X.)I first heard about this new Canon G1 X 14.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD in January of this year and last month I received an email from \"Popular Photography\" about their test results (which now appear in the April 2012 issue).As soon as I saw their test results figures (and read the entire review to which the email linked), I immediately pre-ordered the camera from Amazon! This is the first camera in ten years to induce me to part with 'coin of the realm' and buy it.You can find all three of these reviews online at \"Popular Photography's\" site if you wish to read them.Of course, when I ordered the camera, I had no idea whether or not I would really like it. I was taking a chance.But now that I actually have the G1 X, I can only say that I am VERY pleased with it, as pleased as possible.Among its other attributes, its lens stops down to f/16, something I have sorely missed for the past ten years. Do you know the old photographer's trick? On a bright sunny day set the aperture to f/16 and then set the shutter speed to the speed of the 'film' [the ISO rating you have chosen]. Set the focus either to Infinity or to ten feet [depending on the nature of your main subject]. Exposure will be perfect and everything will be sharp. On cloudy days, set the aperture to f/11, and so forth. The wider the aperture, of course, the more critical focusing becomes. (I always recommend 'bracketing' your shots, both for focus and exposure; it's easy to do with this camera, either automatically or, my own preference, manually.)This camera, with its relatively large, relatively fast lens (at the wide angle setting; the range is f/2.8 to f/16), its wide range of shutter speeds (60 seconds to 1/4000 of a second), and its ability to create superb pictures even when using a high ISO setting, thus offers a VERY high dynamic range. This means that you will be able to take pictures in just about any lighting condition (and without using flash if that is your preference, as it is mine) and the pictures will turn out exactly the way you want them.I have uploaded some pictures along with the information about the parameters. Other people have uploaded even better pictures than mine and I hope you will look at all of them. You will see just what this camera can achieve under many varied conditions.I have also uploaded a (rather pathetic - sorry about that) 1-minute video which, bad as it is, does show the image capabilities of this camera under some trying conditions (and, if you see any noise, it is solely due to the fact that I had to compress the original video to conform to Amazon's requirements; there is absolutely NO noise in the original video).And in the still images, I see hardly any 'noise' ('grain') no matter under what conditions I take a picture. While the lens is not as fast as I should like (f/2.8 [moderately fast - but I really wish it were f/2.0] at its wide-angle setting to f/5.8 [very slow - and I really wish it were faster] at its maximum telephoto setting), the fact that you can easily use high ISO settings (the range is ISO 100 to ISO 12,800) with little or no loss of image quality (unlike the Fujifilm models) MORE THAN MAKES UP for the lack of lens brightness (and, as a trade-off, slower lenses can produce sharper pictures as focus is not as critical as it is with fast lenses).In other words, you can use a sensitivity rating of ISO 6400 (and sometimes, depending upon the nature of the subject, even ISO 12,800) with hardly any visible noise in the picture! As far as I know, there is no other compact camera on the market which can achieve that!Why does this camera have this capability while other competitors do not? It is because of the sensor size in it. Its sensor is 1.5 inches (the Fujifilm X-10's sensor s only 2/3 inch), it has 14.1 mega-pixels, plus it has Canon's very advanced design for noise reduction (which, by the way, is user-adjustable). A 1.5 inch sensor is almost the same size as the APS-C-sized sensors used in most DSLR cameras. I believe that no other compact fixed-zoom-lens camera has such a large sensor.Naturally a larger sensor requires a larger (and heavier) lens yet Canon has managed to design the lens to a fairly reasonable size and weight (and the camera's overall weight is also quite reasonable - plus it is well-balanced).This absolutely first-rate lens (there can be no other description for it) has a 4:1 zoom range; this may be an inadequate zoom range for some people (especially those who favor 'superzooms') but note that, everything else being equal, the lower the zoom ratio the sharper the lens (\"prime\" lenses being the sharpest of all) and the lower the zoom ratio, the lower the lens distortion. This lens's zoom ratio is certainly adequate for me!And it's the large sensor and the large sharp lens which allow for the truly superb pictures this camera produces.A large sensor coupled with a relatively large lens has another major advantage: the ability to make excellent closeup 'portrait' photos (which allow the main subject to be in sharp focus while the background is blurred). Yes, this can be done with post-processing software but here it can be done in-camera. DSLRs can do this routinely but few compact cameras can. (You can also get the same results using fully manual aperture/shutter settings and manual focus.)As with most other digital cameras, there are various scene settings (Kids & Pets, Fireworks, Sports, etc.) which I have not yet used but which will probably come in handy at various times.Multiple facial recognition (as well as red-eye reduction, both prevention before and fixing after taking a flash picture) is also offered as is blink indication. Regarding flash (which I myself use only rarely and then I use only the built-in flash), the camera does have a 'hot-shoe' so that, with an optional bracket, very sophisticated flash attachments (Canon Speedlights for example) can be used.In addition, the built-in flash can be physically lowered into the body when you're not using it, a nice touch. In the 'P' Program setting, I leave the flash in the 'on' position but with the flash body lowered into the camera so it won't fire. Then, when I occasionally do wish to use flash, all I have to do is to raise the flash body and it's ready to go.Naturally burst shooting is present and it appears to be very sophisticated. Automatic bracketing is another feature and, using the available HDR setting, three images can be combined automatically to allow for a high dynamic range (note that the subject must not move; this is primarily for landscapes or cityscapes).This camera has a myriad of possible adjustments; to obtain maximum benefit from them will frankly require a long learning curve (I have just scratched the surface!).However - and this is a BIG however - right out of the box you can use its Auto setting and probably 95+% of your pictures will come out fine (and they will be of far higher quality than almost all other compact fixed-lens cameras and on a par with any produced by DSLRs). If and when you desire to be a bit more creative (in camera), well you can 'play' with the menu adjustments and set the camera to do what you like. (And you need not worry about messing up the settings: there is a quick Reset All option which sets everything back to factory defaults.)Just as on a DSLR, there are options to take pictures in several ways: fully automatically; aperture-priority (you set the lens opening, the camera decides the shutter speed); shutter-priority (you set the shutter speed and the camera decides the aperture); and full manual (you set everything). (This is what I use most of the time.) Note that the camera will show you \"correct\" settings (what it thinks is correct) and you can reset your settings to what the camera has decided or you can ignore that altogether.This model also features a terrific articulating LCD screen. So did my G2 but its size (about an inch diagonal) and its brightness were severely wanting. Not so with this G1 X; the LCD screen is big and bright and I have to tell you that it is my opinion that an articulating LCD screen is the only way to go. The advantages of having one of these becomes very apparent as you use it. As a matter of fact, I would not, under any circumstances, purchase an expensive camera which did not have one.Do you like to shoot in RAW (or RAW + JPEG) mode? It's easy with this camera (and fast too if you have a fast-writing card) and you do NOT need to use Canon's software to process and edit RAW images. [You can view a picture I took in RAW mode and adjusted via software - both done very quickly - in the uploaded photo section.]Are there any possible disadvantages? Sure there are! Automatic focusing in low-light situations is perhaps very slightly slower than I should like but, in fact, I use manual focus for the most part (I use manual aperture and shutter settings most of the time too) and the auto focus is not nearly as slow as some people suggest; obviously it is much faster in bright conditions but it seems adequately fast in most low-light situations too. I know that some people would rather have the ability to turn a lens ring to manually adjust focus (I would too) but such an option is probably not possible at this time with a lens such as this one. In any case, as I have been manually focusing via a menu option for the last ten years, this is no problem for me. (And outdoors I use the 'trick' I mentioned so I generally do not need to focus the lens at all. This 'trick' can be used for high-speed outdoor sports photography.)I also wish there were a \"Bulb\" setting for long exposures but, unfortunately, this camera does not support that. (Truth to tell, in my well over 50 years of taking pictures, I have used the \"Bulb\" setting only two or three times and that was with 35mm film cameras.)Some people have commented on the fact that the optical viewfinder does not display any information (even about focusing, as in true rangefinder cameras) as well as the fact that, at the wide-angle setting, the necessarily large lens obscures the lower left portion (the lens disappears when setting it to telephoto). Though they are correct, and this is one of the few really valid complaints about this camera, at least for me, this is not too significant: I use the optical viewfinder rarely, only when I am taking pictures outdoors under very bright light (and the 3-inch LCD on this camera is so bright - so far I have used it only at its default brightness, 50% - that it may not even be necessary to use the optical viewfinder as often as I did with my older G2, if at all). Nonetheless, the camera really should have an EVF rather than an optical viewfinder. As we're unlikely to see any more reasonably-priced true rangefinder cameras, I believe that the day of the optical viewfinder has passed.So if an optical viewfinder is of major importance to you, you may wish to look elsewhere. However, the mediocrity of this feature is not enough to sway my opinion or enjoyment of the camera.One disadvantage of this particular large lens and large sensor is that it cannot focus very closely (7 inches is about as close as you can get). If you do a LOT of Macro shooting, and do not wish to buy auxiliary lenses, this may not be the camera for you. I only rarely wish to use Macro so this is not a disadvantage for me personally. [But see my uploaded Macro picture of an Iris flower within the \"View and share related images\" section; if you know what you're doing, you can indeed take ultra-closeups with the G1 X.]I have to say that, though it is acceptable, I generally do not care for a 'press and click on' (or 'center-pinch') type of lens cap, much preferring the old-fashioned kind which just slips on (of course I want a cord attachment; this one has it). The internal mechanism of 'press and click on' types can break if not handled carefully. Just my opinion.And regarding the lens, WHY OH WHY do manufacturers of advanced compact cameras NOT put filter threads within their lenses? Canon makes you buy a Canon FADC58C 58mm Filter Adapter for G1 X which, like the adapter I had to use on my G2, is cumbersome and a plain pain to have to use every time you want to attach a filter. You must remove the lens surround ring (and put it somewhere), attach the filter adapter, and then attach the filter. You can't leave this Canon filter adapter mounted full-time because the lens cap won't work with it. So, when you're done shooting using a filter, you must reverse the procedure by retrieving the surround ring, removing the filter and the filter adapter, and then reattaching the surround ring in order to use the lens cap. This is BRILLIANT(?!?) design! [But please see my May 6 update about an inexpensive and complete remedy for this.]However you can see that these 'disadvantages' are QUITE minor (they could be called 'nit-picking') and have no bearing whatsoever on the quality of the pictures you will get or even the ease of taking them.This Canon has many individual and well-designed physical controls (thus minimizing the necessity for using menu options when actually taking pictures) yet very strangely this model does not offer one additional button (which it should have): it would have been nice had Canon included a white balance button to quickly adjust the setting. But the camera does have an 'assignable' button and I assigned white balance to it (so that takes care of that problem!). And, if a situation requires you to change the assignable button, even temporarily, to something else, that is quick and easy to do.The rest of the controls are, again in my opinion, exemplary in design.Of course, in the final analysis the question is: how good are the pictures? I have to say that, based on my own use of the camera, they are, in a word, SUPERB. If you look at the pictures (and the video) I and others have posted here, you can judge for yourself.Color in the 'standard' setting is positively beautiful, vivid and accurate. And, for certain circumstances, there are many color adjustments available (assuming you are shooting JPEG; if shooting RAW, you adjust the color via your RAW processing program). Black-and-White photos are luminous; I can think of no other word to describe them. Sepia-toned pictures are also very, very beautiful.If one were to try to compare pictures made with this model with similar ones made with much more expensive DSLRs, and one did it 'blind' (in other words he/she did not know which photos were made with which camera), I do not think anyone could distinguish between them. That's how high in quality pictures taken with this camera are.I hope that you have found this somewhat lengthy review to be of some value to you (sorry, there's still some more to go!). I have tried to explain my thought processes in the decision to replace my ten-year-old G2 (which I'm still keeping, however) with this new one (which is a much more advanced, sophisticated, and capable model) and, if your wishes are similar to mine, then I am certain that you will be as pleased with the G1 X as I am.I have a couple of small 'point-and-shoots:' the Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) and the Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, HD Video Capture and 3.0-Inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD (Silver). For what they are they are nice, and my wife and I take them along wherever we go.But, regarding quality of pictures produced, they're not even in the same ballpark as this Canon model. (I gave them 5-stars each but that is within their category, the only fair way, I think, to rate a product.)And you can, if you wish when you first obtain it, just set this camera to its full Auto setting and it will be as easy and as quick as any of those 'point-and-shoots' and, of course, the pictures will be vastly superior. I suggest that you start off that way and, as you become more familiar with it, you'll want to start trying some of the more advanced features. You will never 'outgrow' this camera. Obviously, if you have someone else take a picture, you would merely set the camera to Auto.And as further proof of ease of use (with the caveat that you know what you're doing!), please note that I took all of the pictures (and the video) after just a couple of hours of 'playing' with the camera and WITHOUT reading the instruction manual. Of course operation is rather straightforward and it's quite similar to that of my PowerShot G2. If you have ever used any advanced compact digital camera (including Superzooms, etc.), you should have no difficulty with this one. If you have never used such a camera, the voluminous (242 page) instruction manual found on the included CD-ROM will answer any and all of your questions about this particular camera.My 10-year old Canon PowerShot G2 featured construction of the absolute highest quality; it is still functioning as it did when new (and it still looks new!). This new Canon PowerShot G1 X appears to be constructed with the same integrity (and its body is made of metal, not plastic).In conclusion, it is my belief that, with this camera, no matter what you do or how \"poor\" a photographer you are (and I'm afraid I'm one of the most mediocre, at least aesthetically-speaking), you just can't help but get really fine pictures, something you can't always say with many other models.If you are in the market for a camera such as this, I recommend that, after you investigate this one carefully, if it appeals to you, just buy it.Is it expensive? It most certainly is! But (assuming you have sufficient financial resources), the question to ask is do you get good value for money? In my opinion, the answer is a most resounding 'yes!'However, if, for some reason, you do not like it, and, if you have bought it from Amazon (something I strongly recommend), you merely contact them and they will arrange it such that you can return the camera at no cost to you (and you'll get a refund quickly!). Just make certain that you have given the camera a fair chance over an appropriately lengthy (as necessary) period of intensive study and experimentation.This camera or even this type of camera (essentially very expensive 'point-and-shoot' cameras, albeit extremely advanced) is not for everyone. It's not even for the majority of people. But I believe that there are enough people who would rather have this type than a DSLR such that Canon will sell a significant number of them. The fact that this camera seems to be in relatively short supply confirms my thoughts.As I stated at the beginning of this review, I and some other people desire an advanced, highly capable, camera with a high-quality fixed-zoom-lens, a large sensor, and the ability to take pictures under many varied conditions (including low-light without flash) and have those pictures turn out exactly as desired (and at the same, or at the very least practically the same, high image quality as those which can be obtained with much more expensive DSLRs). In my opinion, this one is IT!Thus I give this camera my highest possible recommendation and, if you buy one, I hope you like it as much as I do.Thank you for reading all of this (perhaps the \"War and Peace\" of camera reviews?) and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H. Bulk==================================================================================================================================Update: May 6, 2012Back when I bought that PowerShot G2, Canon included a 32 MB 'starter' Compact Flash card. No such luck with this one. Canon included NO card - plus the camera has NO internal memory. That means that you MUST buy a card at the same time you buy the camera; I bought two (I always like backups) SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB, SDHC, UHS-1 Flash Memory Card SDSDXPA-016G-X46,Black, a very good one - and it writes and reads very fast; the 16 GB size is sufficient for me as I download pictures to my computer (and back them up to external hard drives) at least once a day (and with two cards, I have plenty of capacity).There are some other accessories I recommend that you buy (in addition to an SD card): this Power 2000 PT72 Replacement Recharger for Canon NB-10L Battery or P2K ACD-347 and two (2) Power2000 1200Mah Lithium Battery Replacement For Canon NB-10L Battery (For Canon SX40 HS Camera). (Why two spare batteries? Because, while this camera is not a 'battery hog,' nonetheless, its battery does not last quite as long as I should like. Anyway, that is my recommendation.) Fortunately, neither of these two accessories are expensive.I bought this COSMOS \u00ae Brown Leather Case Cover Bag For Canon Powershot G1X Digital Camera DC G1 X + Cosmos cable tie which, at the time, was the only non-OEM case being offered by Amazon. While its price is good, Amazon now has other cases (which look almost the same as mine) for much less money; you'll want to investigate them.Mentioning non-OEM: I suggest that you AVOID Canon's own accessories. They are, in my opinion (and my opinion only), grossly overpriced (and, as mentioned below, often inferior in quality).You will certainly want a filter adapter; using that adapter is the only way to mount filters onto this camera. Canon's is expensive and it is made from ABS plastic. (Plus Canon warns that you should not attach anything heavier than just one filter at a time to it. That's because the plastic can deform and pop off the camera.) This material also frequently binds to either the lens itself or to the filter, making removal to be an annoyance (you can easily find comments about this online).The answer? Purchase a non-OEM version of the filter adapter for this camera. Most look identical to Canon's but look for one machined from Delrin, a plastic product which is much better for this purpose than ABS in every way. They are less expensive than Canon's own! And Delrin is stronger; it won't deform as ABS plastic does and thus it can hold one or more filters, an auxiliary lens, and a lens hood all at the same time (a reasonable number of attachments of course; you don't want to put TOO much pressure on the lens!). Unlike Canon's adapter, it will not stick or bind with any reasonable use.I noted in a Comment to this review (some time ago) that Canon's lens hood is a ridiculous design in that you cannot use the hood at the same time you use a filter. That's about as silly as it can be! Some eB@y sellers offer lens hoods which can attach to the front of a filter adapter, or even to a 58mm filter (with one or more filters attached to the adapter). These hoods attach to any 58mm threads. So, unlike Canon's, these non-OEM filter adapters (and one or more filters) CAN be left on full time, even when you want to use a lens hood.There are also available, at a very low price, a lens cap (again of the 'press and click-on' type) which will fit over a 58mm filter adapter or a 58mm filter. It is necessarily larger in diameter than Canon's own. I bought two (just in case one breaks!) and it works perfectly. It's certainly inexpensive enough.Using an auxiliary filter attachment along with its lens cap turns something otherwise inconvenient (as designed by Canon) into something very convenient indeed.Here's something very important to me: even with a filter attachment and one (58mm UV) filter as well as the lens cap all attached, the whole camera still fits perfectly into the Cosmos case I bought. So I can now leave the filter adapter, a UV filter, and the lens cap (when attaching it) on full time.Filters and other accessories of your choice can easily be found inexpensively online or at local stores.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The finest advanced point & shoot on the planet", "Author": "T. Campbell", "ReviewID": "R2UMF4RB3HT6Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After declaring that this is \"the finest point & shoot on the planet\" - I should follow up by saying this camera is NOT for everyone.  This camera was designed with specific goals and targeted to a specific kind of customer.  It achieves its goals in that regard... but since not everyone wants a camera with these capabilities, this camera MAY not be for you.The G series from Canon are their most advanced point & shoots.  The G1 X, specifically, was designed for customers who ALREADY OWN A DSLR but need a 2nd camera.  If you do own a DSLR, you may already be aware that there are some places where you can't take your DSLR (e.g. places that don't allow \"professional cameras\" -- defined as any camera with a removable lens) and/or places where, while you COULD take your DLSR... it might not be the best idea.If you're familiar with the G series, this camera looks very much like the rest of them.  So close, actually, that you might not notice the size difference unless you put a prior G series camera next to this one.  Sitting next to a G12, the G1 X is just a tiny bit bigger.  The size difference is due to the sensor and the lens.  While this camera is just a tiny bit bigger on the outside, it's HUGE on the inside... it has a sensor which is 6 times larger than a G12.  It actually uses the SAME sensor as the 7D, except it's been cropped down to 80% of the size (but the photo-site density and size are identical.)  When you grow the sensor by that much, you've GOT to grow the lens to match.  The lens barrel diameter is significantly larger.  If you were hoping for a camera that you can slip in your pocket... keep moving, this camera is not for you (unless you have really bulky pockets.)Keep in mind that lens design is essentially a game of trade offs.  The highest quality lenses do not zoom... at all.  As soon as a lens can \"zoom\" the compromises start adding up  (barrel distortion, chromatic aberration (fringing), contrast & resolution, vignetting, etc.).  You can control optical quality on lenses that just zoom a little (e.g. 3-5x zoom usually can control optical qualities fairly well).  As you get into lenses that can zoom a LOT (e.g. 10x or greater) than the lens becomes all about convenience and NOT about the optical quality.  As the G1 X was made to keep the pro shooters happy, this \"point & shoot\" camera is all about the optical quality and NOT about the zoom.  If you're looking for a 10x, 14x, or bigger zoom... move along... this is not the camera you are looking for.  Don't ding the camera for limiting itself to a 4x zoom.  That is absolutely intentional -- again, lens design is a game of trade-offs.The body is metal and, as I've already managed to drop mine (long story), I can vouch for the fact that it is durable.It has a hot-shoe for dedicated speedlites.  I have actually used it with my Speedlite 430EX II and 580EX II.  While they work perfectly... you look a bit silly when the flash gun is larger than the camera.  So I keep a Speedlite 270EX with the camera when I need supplemental lighting or fill flash.  The 270EX has no controls other than an on-off switch, but the G1 X can control the flash from on-camera menus (so I can dial flash exposure compensation up & down.)  The 270 can \"bounce\", but since it's not nearly as powerful as the larger speedlites (but significantly more powerful than the built-in pop-up flash) I realize that there are limits to what it can do (but again... if you seriously need more, you CAN connect any Canon speetlite.  It fully supports Canon E-TTL and E-TTL II ... just like the DSLR bodies.)There are two advantages of the larger sensor and lens... physical larger photo-sites on the sensor mean that they are better at collecting light.  This camera's ISO performance is 4 times better than what you'd get from a G12 (the previous flagship advanced point & shoot from Canon).  And of course optically the camera also performs better.  Issues such as diffraction limits and much easier to deal with as the sensor and lens size increase.  The optical performance of this camera, considering it a point & shoot, is amazing.One drawback of the physically larger sensor and lens is that it does make it a bit more difficult to take close-up shots.  I've adapted to this and refined some technique that works pretty well, and you could always crop in tight (you have the megapixels to spare).  But if you want the best close-ups, then buy a Canon 250D 58mm Close-up Lens for A700, A710IS, G1, G2, G3, G5, G6 & EOS SLR Cameras.  This is a close-up diopter, but whereas a typical budget diopter is subject to chromatic aberration (aka color fringing) around the edges, the 250D is a dual-element diopter.  It's an achromatic doublet so it combats the chromatic aberration of a budget close-up filter (at a premium cost... but then if you're buying an $800 point & shoot to supplement your DSLR which might cost a few thousand, then you're probably not too worried about buying an achromatic doublet version of a close-up filter that captures much higher quality images.)  You'll need the Canon FA-DC58C \"filter adapter\" (and as I write this review... they are VERY hard to find in stock anywhere.)  The camera lens doesn't have filter threads... the adapter connects like a lens-hoods (put it on and give it a quarter twist to lock) and provides 58mm diameter threads so you can thread-on any filter you want.I've taken several detailed shots comparing the performance of my 5D II to the G1 X and, while the G1 X doesn't outperform a 5D II, I have to say that it comes a lot closer than I was expecting.As a G series camera, it allows for much of the same shooting modes found on a DSLR... full-auto, program (P), shutter priority (Tv), aperture priority (Av), and of course manual (M).  It allows for two custom modes where you can configure the camera and recall all your settings instantly but switching to that mode.  There's a front and back selection wheel and these work pretty much the same as they would on a professional body DSLR (e.g. In manual mode I can control the shutter speed with the front wheel and aperture with the back wheel -- exactly the way it works on my 5D.  BTW, you can re-configure this if you want.)I'll warn you that it is a bit of a pig on battery life.  Buy a spare battery to make sure that you can make it through the day (and if you're a heavy shooter... buy more than one.)It does have support for Eye-Fi built-in.  I picked up an Eye-Fi Pro X2 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-8PC (it took me 2 days to figure out how to get the obtuse little thing working... but now that it works, it's a thing of beauty.)", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Like Mine. A LOT!", "Author": "Rachel Barr", "ReviewID": "R136HSBFQ1V38Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ah, the much-maligned Canon PowerShot G1 X!If you're already a PowerShot G series user and understand this line of cameras, you probably suspect the issues that you read about are moot points. And for most photographers, you would be right. It is a point-and-shoot compact with ample manual control and RAW capability. It takes stunning photographs with a minimum of fuss. It's what I've been wishing for since the birth of digital photography. Excellent image quality in a portable, all-in-one package. What's not to like?For years I've used PowerShot G series cameras as SLR backups because they had RAW capability, plenty of manual control, and portability. They were not without their limitations, though. And those limitations were frustrating. Namely, those associated with a small sensor--high ISO noise, noise reduction smearing and narrow dynamic range. This camera more than addresses those issues. Dynamic range is improved. High ISO image noise is well controlled without noticeable loss of detail. I don't find its performance significantly slower than my G12. It DOES work in low light--and the pictures are beautiful. Clean and usable through ISO 3200 (and, hey, 6400 is actually pretty decent). Image quality in some ways is better than my EOS 60D. And the resolution is great enough to allow some cropping without noticeable loss of quality.Others have already said it, but it bears repeating. (And repeating.) It's unfair to compare this camera with compact system (mirrorless and four-thirds) cameras, DSLRs or any other camera for that matter because it stands alone in its class. It isn't a CSC, and it isn't a DSLR. It's a solidly built, all-in-one point-and-shoot compact with a big sensor and a fixed lens that zooms. In short, a maverick camera. Granted, it's not for everyone, but for photographers who use care composing their images or just like always having a camera handy--one that takes truly excellent pictures--this is it. Enough cannot be said about the quality of images through ISO 3200. Or the gorgeous, high-resolution vari-angle LCD. Or its creative capabilities.I can put the G1 X in my purse or hang it around my neck and carry it without discomfort. And no fiddling with an array of lenses and gadgets. Because the lens retracts a good way into the body when the camera is powered off, it is fairly compact to carry. Compact for what it is--a large sensor camera with with a 28-112mm zoom lens, a built-in flash, an external flash hot shoe, optical viewfinder and a high-resolution, 3\" vari-angle LCD. It will fit in a coat pocket, no problem. (But you WOULD look and feel kinda funny with it in a pants pocket.)I added a CowboyStudio ALC-G1 X Camera Auto Lens Cap Cover, so removing and replacing the lens cap is not necessary, and it works very well.If you're already familiar with Canon's G cameras, there's only a small learning curve. More like a blip than a curve. Mostly it's remembering to use macro mode for close subjects. This swiftly becomes an automatic motion. That's about it. In some ways the controls are simpler to use than the G12's. For my style of shooting, minimum focus distance is its only drawback, and with the Canon 250D 58mm Close-up Lens, this camera takes incredibly good macro pictures with beautiful bokeh.For someone who's not familiar with the G series, there's some ground to cover for manual controls, but the good news is that the camera has several very useful scene modes where the camera makes the decisions for you, and JPEGS straight from the camera are colorful, sharp and accurately exposed. It is equally suited to the hands of novice and seasoned shooter alike.In Review mode, there's a slight lag when you press the button before you can see the image--the G12 is faster in that regard. In shooting mode, shot-to-shot time is slower by a fraction of a second. Shutter lag--yes, a little, but not that noticeable if you're accustomed to the performance of this camera series through the G12 model. (Can't say anything about the G15 because I've never used one.) Autofocus is actually quite fast, but it takes the camera a little time to register. Go ahead and snap the shutter. You can trust it. It has already locked focus before the camera tells you so--and it's pretty darned accurate.Although I don't often use video mode, when I do, I like the ability to zoom in and out while recording, something new to the G series. And I appreciate true HD video. The file format doesn't eat up huge chunks of computer memory, either, and videos are more easily shared than with previous G model cameras.Battery life is short. Really short. If you take a lot of pictures or videos in a day, it's a good idea to have at least a couple of spares charged and on hand.And the camera is too expensive. Period. A lot of cameras are. I understand that cost of production makes it so, but it is still too expensive. I couldn't afford one at its price point until I found a good deal on a \"used, like new\" copy.I keep it in a clever camera bag that doubles as a small purse. In addition to my usual purse stuff (ID, credit cards, insurance cards, lipstick, hairbrush, etc), there's room for a couple of extra batteries and the Canon 250D filter for true macro shooting.This one goes everywhere with me. My 60D goes with me on special occasions. Those don't happen often. Life happens every day. And with the G1 X, I got it covered. In beautiful, professional quality images!", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "High-end toy which fails as a people photographer's companion", "Author": "Ranty", "ReviewID": "R2ALRKTS6DEHTC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using Canons for decades, film and digital. I have owned a G9 for years, and got this as a replacement. I wanted to love the camera, and originally did, but with use, the clutzy handling (due to poor design/target-market choices by Canon) and the limitations of the lens have me relegating the camera to third stringer.My angle is this: I used to be a working pro. I started out in large format and became a photojournalist. In a camera like this, I'm looking for portability, good images (for me, meaning, a RAW file to be fixed up later), and enough speed to work as a moment catcher. (For reference, the camera I used to use most in this mode was a little Rollei 35.) Where the G1X fails rather completely is as a moment catcher.First the good: The chip in this camera is amazing. Nearly as good as on my 5D. The lens is also very sharp across its usable range. I like the design. The weight and feel are right, with the hand grip providing a perfect control surface. I have always worn small cameras around my neck, so the size and weight here are just fine by me. I don't want something to shove in my pocket. I want a good camera, at the ready, that won't have me fatigued by the end of the day. The G1X succeeds here. If you have 30 seconds to unfold the screen, power the thing up, compose on the screen, prefocus, and shoot, you will get nice photos with this. Of course, that means you're pretty much limited to using this as a glorified camera  phone, shooting only inanimate objects or groups of people standing there waiting for the shutter to snap. That's what mass-appeal pocket cameras are good for already, so I expected more from this one, and alas, didn't get it.I have, over the years, used my G9 both in slowpoke/tourist/line-em-up-and-shoot-em mode, but it was also a decent little street photography camera, and good enough for basic moment capturing. You could stick it up to your eye and use the (yes, very limited) eyepiece to frame up most of the scene, and shoot. The shot wasn't lightning quick, and you had to extrapolate where the actual coverage was going to be from the 75% or so that the viewfinder covered, but it worked OK. The G1X fails completely here, for several reasons.One is that the focus doesn't work for squat if you have the screen closed up. Facial-recognition focus (one of the high points of the camera when in screen-shooting mode) doesn't work unless the screen is open. Using intelligent field focus also, for me, yielded horrible results with the screen closed. The camera was constantly back focused, even when I was a reasonable distance from subjects so that viewfinder/lens parallax shouldn't have been an issue.Worst of all, by far, is the atrocious close focusing distance with the G1X. I do a fair amount of shooting within a couple feet of the subject to be focused. The G1X consistently misses these subjects unless swapped into macro mode, and by the time you've done that, you've lost your moment. I'm not kidding when I say this is atrocious. The distance at which you need to swap it into macro mode seems to be nearly 1 meter. Oddly enough, if you use the camera in green, \"idiot\" mode, it's smart enough to flip into macro mode on its own. But if you do that, tough luck on the RAW images. You don't get to record RAWs unless you're not in idiot mode. Even in macro mode, the close focusing distance is way too far off. I don't expect this to be a macro camera. But I do once in a while shoot a semi-close-up of foliage or sculptural details when on vacation or out for a walk, and whereas you could get a suitable close-up with the G9, you can't get anywhere near the subject with the G1X. A foot or more away from the front element (while zoomed back at the widest angle setting) is the best you can do.I mentioned the sloppy handling. I think Canon really tips its hand on the end market when you consider that under your thumb, where a real camera would have some kind of switch of importance, this one has a video recording button. I could not possibly care less about recording video, so this is a complete waste to me. I didn't think it would be a potential deal-breaker until I began using the camera where my muscle memory from using my other Canons (and other cameras) constantly had me using my thumb to try to focus (5D) or lock exposure (other Canons) and I would get a video started. Meanwhile, the real controls for picture making (AE lock, focus point) are too far down, around the control dial, and not easy to feel.The control dial itself is an amazing failure in engineering. It's concentric with a circular, 4-way control pad, yet the control dial ALSO works when pressed as a 4-way control pad. That's bad, because its surface isn't gnarled enough and the force necessary to depress it (the dial) is so light that you CANNOT normally use it as a dial. The very act of trying to spin it requires enough thumb force to depress it, registering functions or settings you don't want. This is a horrible, horrible mistake, one that will be most obvious to users of Canon's SLRs, where the control dial is a dial.I pre-ordered this camera, and wanted to love it. The reality of using it on a vacation was that, within 2 days, I was so frustrated with the slow handling and with missing photos that I stuffed it in my backpack and stopped making pictures. That, to me, is the mark of a failed camera. Luckily for me, during this vacation, I stumbled by a store that had a Fujifilm Finepix X100 in the window, and familiar with it (I was considering it before I settled on the G1X), I went in to try it out. I determined very quickly that the X100 was a vastly superior platform for capturing moments and people, even though its autofocus is slower and more limted than the G1Xs, and even though it has only the single-length lens. The G1X remained in my backpack the rest of the trip, while I racked up many great images on the X100 thanks to its excellent handling and superior low-light performance.My recommendation: If you are looking for something that handles with the relative slowness of, say, an old, medium-format twin-lens reflex camera, or you shoot only stationary subjects for the most part, then you may love the G1X.If you are looking for a \"street photography\" camera, something for shooting people, something that handles like a real camera rather than a high-status, hybrid toy, stay away and look into something like the Fujifilm x100 which, for all its quirks, is a much more serious still camera.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Falls short of expectations but still the best that I can find for now", "Author": "Scott Chou \"Scott\"", "ReviewID": "RHNLY7OA1FJN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Canon G1X for a month now including a week long vacation where I shot it at least 500 times. I'm now confident in expressing my impressions about this camera. I own cameras in nearly every usage category including full-format DLSR, APS-C DSLR, mirrorless, super zoom, travel zoom, premium compact, waterproof, and iPhone. I change at least one of my cameras every 3 months just so I can try out interesting new devices like this G1X. I sought out this particular camera to replace my need for APS-C cameras entirely by having a large sensor, compact size, and view finder. Yes, the viewfinder made my short list because I've gotten used to shooting DSLR style for the stability and speed. I didn't mind the fixed lens of the G1X because my lens collection is built around my FF DSLR and I typically use APS-C only with a single all-purpose lens. I've also been disappointed in the compactness of most other mirrorless systems because of the large protruding lenses. I feel that if the camera can't really fit in your pocket, then it might as well be a small DSLR rather than a camera with performance compromises. This Canon met my expectations for compactness and still provided a 4x retractable zoom lens. I've tried the Lumix 4/3 combos with their 3x power zoom and I don't think the image quality was as good as this G1X although Lumix had better viewfinder options. Moreover, the Lumix body-viewfinder-lens combos were $300 to $500 more than this Canon. Anyhow, this Canon met my image quality expectations and is ergonomically a great all-in-one vacation camera/video recorder. However, I'm disappointed with its performance in a few areas. AF speed is poor so you suffer from shutter lag on the delay between pressing and the picture actually being taken. The shot to shot recovery time is also terrible so you can't fire multiple frames at a baby in hopes of finally catching the perfect smile. Moreover, my iPhone and Sony cameras have trained me to believe that HDR is a must-have feature. My Nikon SLRs rely on bracketing and don't have HDR, and I've never been happy about it. So I was psyched to see that this Canon had built-in HDR in addition to bracketing but disappointed to use it. It requires a tripod and nothing in the scene to be moving. That really cuts down on its usefulness. I tried shooting multiple times in daylight with as steady a grip as I could muster but the HDR still blurred the 2 frames during the merge. I had to plant the camera on a stationery object and use the delay timer to finally get a perfect shot. Something I've been taking for granted on all of my Sonys (NEX and HXv models). Another flunk was the macro mode. Whether you induce macro by focusing close in AUTO mode or deliberately set the macro mode, it can hardly focus on close objects. This lens just wasn't cut out for close objects. I don't think it's even possible after a lot of trying, so I had to backup, zoom in, and shoot multiple times through the fussy focus hunting to grab a sharp shot. Again, this is something I take for granted on my iPhone or compacts. The optical viewfinder is reliable, mimics the zoom, and convenient but it has parallax error and doesn't display any shooting data like an SLR would. The live viewfinders on the NEX7, Fuji and Lumix models definitely win this battle. My final flunk is of small consequence and that is the panorama mode. It's an unusuable joke on this camera. The Sony iSweep Panorama is night and day superior to this stitch-assist piece of junk. Having said that, I let the issue go since I usually stitch panos with more sophisticated post processing software unless the scene has moving subjects. If moving, then the Sony built-in mode is awesome. Although I ran off a list of complaints, my list of praises is actually longer but easier summarized by just saying the image quality is good, ergonomics are good, and the G1X has a long list of functions. In summary, I will keep this camera as my HiQ vacation camera until Sony updates the NEX line to include a full tilt-swivel screen and retractable zoom lens that is sharp.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon G1 X Review--A Professional Grade Compact", "Author": "R.

The sample photographs discussed in this blog can be viewed starting at:[...]This begins a three-part review on Canon's latest semiprofessional compact camera--the G1 X.  Today we'll focus on how this camera was selected and highlight the performance of Canon's latest image processor the DIGIC 5 and the effectiveness of this camera's built-in image stabilization.Canon G1 X with 15.1-60.4 (28-112mm in 35mm equivalency) f/2.8-5.8 lens.If you've been following this blog since April 2, then you've been viewing the progression of our last cruise trip.  Last week we covered Bruges, Belgium, and this week I was going to end the series with our two-day stay in Brussels.  I'm going to postpone that series finale until next week, as I have some other information I would like to impart.So, have you enjoyed the photographs over the past five weeks?  If so, then you can give at least partial credit to my latest photographic tool.  More on that in a moment.I really enjoy DSLR photography.  For that I have a Canon EOS 5D with a 24-105mm f/4.0L Image-Stabilized lens and, a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 Image Stabilized telephoto lens, and a 430EX Speedlite external flash.  The 5D is a great camera capable of great images at even fairly high ISO settings.  Problem is that it's a boat anchor around your neck.  When mated to my 24-105mm lens, the darned thing weighs in at a massive 3 pounds, 7.2 ounces (1,565 grams)!  And don't even get me started on the conspicuousness of the size.  It's like trying to hide a toaster oven.So, for most international travel I like to take a couple of small travel zooms--my Panasonic DMC-ZS3 and DMC-ZS6--and leave the Rock of Gibraltar at home.  Those Panasonics are great little point-and-shoots with a fantastic zoom range (25-300mm in 35mm equivalency), but they have some serious limitations.  The ZS6 has limited controls for aperture and shutter speed, as well as the ability to provide some manual control.  The ZS3 won't even do that much.  Because of their small sensor size (1/2.33\"--6.08 x 4.56mm), neither is very good at anything above ISO 400, and the image actually starts to degrade well before even that.  Neither stores images in raw format.  Still, you can take award-winning photographs with them if you understand photography and how to get the most out what little control the ZS series offers.But I still wanted more in the way of creative control, better high ISO performance, increased resolution, and the wider latitude that raw gives you in post-processing.  With this latest once-in-a-lifetime trip to Normandy coming up, I started doing my research for another camera system.For travel photography I would need in order of importance:1)  Wide angle capability for landscapes, preferably starting in at around 24mm (in 35mm equivalency).2)  Good low-light capabilities for photographing interiors of monasteries, churches, cathedrals, fortresses, etc.  That means a fast lens at wide angles (f/2.0 or better would be ideal), good performance at higher ISO settings (at least ISO 800, preferably even higher), and exceptional image stabilization (at least 3-stops) for hand-held shots.3)  Good low-light means a fairly large sensor.  There is simply no way around that using current technology.  This means I would have to balance the need for a large sensor against the desire to keep the camera/lens combination small and light.4)  Moderate telephoto capability for zooming in on architectural details (I like at least 105mm).Here's what I didn't need:1)  Fast focusing.  In landscapes it's all about the framing and light conditions.  Capturing action is toward the bottom of any travel photographer's priority.2)  High frames-per-second.  Again that's for capturing sports action, playful puppies, rambunctious kitties, and annoyingly hyperactive children.Here's what I was willing to give up:1)  Interchangeable lenses, if the range was close enough to my specifications (see above).  There's nothing more bothersome than specks of dust on the sensor, and changing lenses in the field is an open invitation for these insidious invaders.  Plus, it's heck trying to get cleaning solution for camera sensors past TSA--guns and knives seem to slip through with alarming regularity, but you'd better not have more than three ounces of anything wet, up to and including Granny's Depends it would seem.2)  Macro capability.  Nice to have for close-ups of flowers, but landscapes and architecture don't normally require it.3)  Wide aperture at mild zoom ranges.  That's a hallmark of a portrait lens, as it defocuses the background and directs the viewer's attention to the person being photographed.Given this list, my search for a new travel camera began to look like a tall order.  Most bridge cameras have more zoom range than I would ever need, but their small sensor sizes (usually around 1/1.8\"--7.176 x 5.319mm) meant I would once again be sacrificing ISO performance.  APS-C sensors are large enough for what I needed ISO-wise, but (save for one exception) we're once again talking about going to a DSLR--a DSLR smaller than my full-frame (35mm) EOS 5D, but still a large, burdensome package.  I could go with a smaller ILC, but most use the smaller Micro Four Thirds system, some use an APS-C size, nearly all come with a kit lens that only zooms between 27 and 82.5mm (in 35mm equivalency), and I would be back to having an interchangeable lens dust magnet.Life was suddenly looking like an endless series of compromises that I didn't really care to make.  I was considering packages as small as the Canon G12 and Nikon P7100 and as large as the Sony NEX 5N and NEX 7.Then came the April edition of my Popular Photography subscription.  Right there, on both the cover and on Page 77, was the Canon G1 X.  Specifications:Huge 1.5-inch (18.7 x 14mm) 14.3 megapixel CMOS sensor.4x 28-112mm zoom lens.Great ISO performance through ISO 1,600, and perfectly acceptable all the way through ISO 6,400.  Only at ISO 12,800 did the G1 X reach unacceptable performance levels in Popular Photography's testing, and even then it just barely scored outside the moderate range on noise (3.1 scored on a 3.0 cutoff).Image Stabilization good for 3.5 stops even full-out zoom of 112mm.Image quality and resolution both rated as Extremely High (vertical resolution 2,310 lines at ISO 100 and an incredible 2,220 lines even at ISO 1,600)4.6 inches (117mm) wide; 3.1 inches (78mm) tall; 2.6 inches (68mm) deep (lens retracted); and weighing \"only\" 1 pound 4 ounces (566 grams) including battery, memory card, neck strap, and lens cap (I say \"only\" because that seemed high until I found out the G1 X is built like a tank on a stainless steel chassis).Articulated 3-inch high-resolution (920,000-dot )screen.Internal pop-up flash and a hot shoe for TTL (through the lens) flash metering and exposure control using Canon Speedlite flash units.Canon G1 X with neck strap, lens cap, and lens cap retaining cord. Altogether with battery and memory card the entire package weighs in at 1 pound 4 ounces.My search was over.  Yes, I was giving up a bit on the wide zoom side and lens aperture, but I was exceeding my specifications in nearly every other criteria.  On top of that, I was gaining the latest Canon image processor--the DIGIC 5.My impressions on the DIGIC 5?  I'm personally stunned at the improvement over the EOS 5D's DIGIC 2 on everything from automatic white balancing to contrast and color rendition.  Quite simply put, the DIGIC 5 in most cases makes raw photography and post-processing totally unnecessary.  Except for specialized instances requiring HDR (high-dynamic range) photography, extreme color shifts in lighting, isolated color spectrum subjects, or a few other situations, the DIGIC 5 will in my opinion consistently produce better pictures than I can with raw manipulation.  It's simply that good.  You'll be hard pressed to find an excuse to take anything but JPEGs with this camera.The DIGIC 5 is also the secret behind the remarkably low-noise, high-resolution photographs taken at heretofore unusable high ISO settings.The image stabilization is also astounding.  I was taking hand-held shots of cathedral interiors at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second.Part 2 of this review will continue on Wednesday.  Until then, I would like to present the following hand-held pictures.  Move your cursor over the picture to find the shot details, such as ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  None of these straight-from-the-camera JPEG photographs have been post-processed in any way other than to reduce the size for inclusion in this blog.  All colors, contrast, white balance, noise reduction and other factors result solely from the DIGIC 5 processor and the camera's built-in image stabilization.Taking up where we left off on Monday, we once again turn our attention to Canon's evolutionary/revolutionary Canon G1 X.  I call the G1 X both evolutionary and revolutionary for a couple of reasons, and I'll explain those reasons on Friday.  In the meantime, let's look at the eye of this tiger:The G1 has a 15.1-60.4mm (4X) zoom lens.  When paired to the relatively over-sized (for a \"compact\" camera) 1.5-inch sensor, that gives us a crop factor of a little over 1.85.  So, converting that into comparable focal lengths for a Full-Frame 35mm camera, we arrive at an equivalent zoom range of 28mm to 112mm.What does all that mean to you?  Lenses for different size sensors cannot be compared directly, so the old universal 35mm format has become the de facto standard when comparing the focal lengths of cameras.  This is why I convert the true focal length to the equivalent 35mm focal length whenever I discuss camera lenses--sort of an apples-to-apples comparison, as it were.On a 35mm camera, 50mm to 55mm is considered a \"standard\" or \"normal\" lens.  That means this is the focal length that would reproduce in a 35mm camera the view most comparable to the human eye.  Anything  substantially less (40mm or so) will produce a wide-angle effect, and anything more (starting around 60mm) is considered a telephoto lens.  For candid street photography the preferred focal length is 35mm to 55mm.  Landscapes and architecture generally benefit from wide angles--the wider the better with 24mm being my own personal starting point on what I consider adequate for this task (many photographers like even wider, often going down to 18mm or even less).  In portrait photography the range you want is from 85mm to around 135, with 105mm being the sweet spot . . . provided that you have a wide aperture lens that can adequately defocus the background behind your subject.  More on this last caveat shortly.Thus, the Canon G1 X has a lens that falls just short of the ideal 24mm for landscape and architecture, covers the middle \"normal\" range nicely, and even gets you well into the portrait range.  But the G1 X is not really suited for portraiture.  There's a catch, and that catch is an inadequate aperture at the telephoto range of the zoom.  In photography, the wider the aperture (a lens' f-stop rating) the shallower the potential depth-of-field.  Thus, an 85mm f/2.8 lens is far superior at portraiture than, say, a 105mm at f/5.8, even though 105mm is the better, more flattering focal length.This depth-of-field problem actually gets worse the smaller the sensor.  And the sensor on the G1 X, while class-leading for the compact segment, still falls well below the size of a 35mm sensor.  The smaller the sensor, the deeper the depth-of-field at comparable aperture (f-stop) settings.  So, while f/5.6 might give an adequately shallow depth-of-field on an 85mm fixed to a true 35mm camera, it won't get anywhere near the same effect with a G1 X set at the same aperture and zoomed to the same relative focal length.  The G1 X will defocus the background at telephoto settings; it just won't defocus the background anywhere nearly as well as a larger format camera at the same f-stop.When one considers where this lens excels and where it falls short, once again we can come to the conclusion that the G1 X is clearly aimed at the experienced photographer in need of a backup or smaller camera to complement an existing DSLR system, who at times wants camera raw and full post-processing creative control, and who demands sharper images with higher resolutions than current travel zoom can produce.  And, very apparently, the G1 X engineers had static subjects in mind with an emphasis on travel photography.As good as this lens is, some of the credit for results goes to the camera's imbedded DIGIC 5 image processor.  Below you'll see samples of both uncorrected and corrected photographs chosen to show the inherent defects in the G1 X lens.  These shots were taken in raw and I removed all lens correction algorithms on the left-side photos.  The right-side photographs show the results of the DIGIC 5 processor and what you can expect when shooting JPEG.Take a close look and you'll notice moderate, visible distortion (curvature) and at least some vignetting (peripheral illumination) in the uncorrected shots.  The DIGIC 5 processor all but eliminates these flaws, and it does that very effectively.  Obviously, this pairing of lens, processor, and the programming of lens correction data has resulted in a very effective package.On Wednesday I called the Canon G1 X both evolutionary and revolutionary.  Here's why:The G1 X is an evolutionary step in Canon's long line of G-series compact cameras--cameras designed as secondary systems for serious photographers who already have a DSLR system, but who also at times need something more compact.  But the G1 X doesn't replace the existing G-series.  Rather, it supplements it.  The G12 remains in Canon's lineup, and I suspect there will be a G13 to replace the G12 just as the G1 X will one day be retired by the G2 X.But the G1 X is also revolutionary in that it incorporates the largest sensor ever placed into a compact.  Not only did Canon upsize the sensor, they also switched from CCD to CMOS technology, effectively giving this compact a sensor very nearly on par with their DSLR line.  Indeed, the G1 X sensor has the same pixel density as Canon's semipro 7D.  Thus, with the advent of the G1 X Canon has raised the stakes considerably in this market segment.  Indeed, the G1 X appears to be Canon's answer to the blossoming ILC segment in terms of picture quality and creative control.As far as standard Canon DSLR-like control, the G1 X does differ considerably.  For one thing, the camera does not incorporate Canon's Picture Styles--Standard (high saturation with a tendency to oversaturate reds), Portrait (warms skin tones), Landscape (moderately high saturation with emphasis toward greens and blues), Monochrome, Faithful (true-color rendition based upon daylight white balance), and Neutral (similar to Faithful, but used to capture the most amount of detail in highly saturated or overly contrasty scenes).  Oddly enough, you can set these Picture Styles in Digital Photo Professional (DPP--Canon's included raw processing software), but you cannot set them for JPEG shots.Instead, the G1 X relies more on Scene Modes, and there are a lot of scene modes from which to choose:  Movie Digest, Portrait, Landscape, Kids and Pets, Smart Shutter (detects smiles and activates a self-timer after face recognition or even a wink--great for getting yourself in the shot), High-Speed Burst HQ (don't get excited--the buffer fills up after only six shots, or in about 1.3 seconds), Handheld Night Scene (combines several sequentially taken shots to minimize shake and reduce noise), Beach, Underwater, Foliage, Snow, Fireworks, and Stitch (panorama) Assist.  Unfortunately, Stitch Assist assumes that the camera will only be held in landscape orientation and that you'll only be panning from side-to-side.  You're only option is a rather simplistic choice between right-to-left or left-to-right.  There really should be at least one option to capture vertically or when holding the camera in portrait orientation and panning side-to-side.In addition to Scene Modes, the G1 X offers something I've not seen before in Canon DSLRs--\"Image Effects,\" or \"Creative Filters.\"  My EOS 5D can do red, yellow, or green filtering for Black & White photography, but the G1 X allows for:  High Dynamic Range (internal processing of three bracketed, tripod-mounted shots to produce one picture with higher dynamic range), Super Vivid, Poster Effect, Nostalgic (faded colors), Fisheye, Miniature Model (similar to the fore and aft defocusing of a tilt-shift lens), Toy Camera (dark, blurry corners; offset colors), Color Accent, Color Swap, and Monochrome.  Alas, monochrome does not allow for in-camera filtering for reds, yellows, and blues.  This must be done in raw post processing with DPP, or in the case with JPEGs with third-party software such as Google's Picasa.One really neat feature is a built-in Neutral Density filter.  When engaged, the internal ND filter reduces light falling onto the sensor by three stops, or about 1/8th the amount entering the lens.  When used in conjunction with a tripod, this allows an extremely slow shutter speed during even bright light conditions.  The result is blurred motion or--in the case of moving water--a soft, flowing effect.Now for a major rant:  Hey, Canon, when somebody plunks down the better part of $800, they have every right to expect, nay--demand a hardcopy of the user guide.  Making a 242-page manual only available as a PDF on a CD is, quite simply, unacceptable.  There are far too many features and settings on this camera to commit them all to memory, and it is totally unreasonable to expect someone to carry an electronic reading device with them at all times to reference these items.Other complaints (accessories):  Filter threads should have been incorporated into the lens rather than requiring the separate purchase of a filter adapter.  The optional sunshade will not work while the filter adapter is in place.  The included lens cap will not work over the sunshade.Other complaints (lens aperture):  While image sharpness and resolution are exceptional, the lens is too slow.  This is especially true at the telephoto end but also a factor on the wide side.  I understand that Canon was trying to balance weight and compactness against performance, but I would gladly have given up some of the former for an f/2.0-4.0 lens over the existing f/2.8-5.8.  Had this been done, the G1 X would have excelled in portrait photography as well as travel.Other complaints (lens focal lengths):  On the subject of the lens, a really good travel camera should start out at 24mm on the wide-angle side.  So, a 4.5x 24-to-108mm would be preferable to the 28-112mm used.  A 5x lens with a focal reach of 24-to-120mm would be even better, almost perfect.Stuff others may care about (but I don't):  A tad slow on focusing--hard to get little Johnny romping around the backyard.  Burst mode/frames-per-second practically nonexistent--forget photographing little Johnny's baseball game.  Forget about getting intimate with a small subject--flowers, insects, etc--the macro capability of this camera is probably closer to the Palomar Observatory than to a small travel zoom.Now for some more sample shots, all JPEGs straight out of the G1 X without any post-processing.  Considering that all shots were handheld and that color saturation, balance, and contrast are all untouched, I believe you'll be impressed with how little you'll find yourself falling back on raw and post-processing.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Photos From The G1-X Outweigh Any Limitations", "Author": "DJPeebs \"DJPeebz\"", "ReviewID": "RDPGRGM3UY4SG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon G1-X is an incredibly capable camera that takes breathtaking photos primarily due to its highly touted 14.1 megapixel CMOS sensor. Keeping it simple, here are the main points you should definitely consider before buying the G1-X:PROS:1) The pictures are for the price and size of camera, simply the best. For much less and with greater portability than a DSLR, the picture quality of the G1-X is simply stunning.2) Incredible lowlight results up to ISO 12800.3) Rich feature set with extremely versatile controls and highly customizable shooting settings.CONS:1) No Macro to speak of (7.8\" min.), which I can live with by using my Lumix LX-5 Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - White for super macros.2) Sluggish Autofocus. OK, this one started to annoy me until I took a close look at my photos and was so blown away by the quality that I easily adapted to the AF's idiosyncrasies. The picture quality is that good!3) Unusable Optical Viewfinder is a non-issue for me as I've never really used one anyway. However, I do get that for some people a full coverage optical viewfinder is an absolute necessity.4) Portability - I can't carry the camera in my front pants pocket - oh well, tough, it's time to shoot pictures with the big boys! In situations where portability is paramount, I use my LX-5.5) A Non-Standard 45mm diameter lens has left me scratching my head and pissed off! WTF, Canon?? This means that there is currently not a single UV lens filter available for the G1-X. Unbelievable, yet still minor in the grand scheme of things.The bottom-line is that if any of these limitations are true deal-breakers for you, then do not purchase the G1-X. If, however, picture quality weighs heavily in your camera purchase process (and the price tag doesn't scare you), then the G1-X is for you.As far as I'm concerned and considering everything I wanted from a new camera, I know for sure that the G1-X was the ideal choice for me, but it won't be for everyone.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "If image quality is important", "Author": "Teddy W.

As my thoughts expanded, I realized that the text exceeded plausible comment lengths, and might be better suited as a separate review].I concur with most of Wang's review and recommend careful reading of it to anyone for a summary of excellent features found in the G1X. However, I find the designation \"flaws\" to describe features that require adjustment and extra care on the part of the photographer harsh and exaggerated. The word \"flaws\" might be mistaken for truth, which would be unfortunate as it might cause doubt in the minds of potential buyers in the sense of: \"Better wait for the next model.\" I am not affiliated with Canon and not in the loop of advance announcements of new cameras, but if you're on the fence with the notion that the G1X is somehow flawed, I recommend you think again and start looking at this camera with fresh eyes and consideration of the admirable way technical trade-offs to accommodate a large image sensor are incorporated in this ergonomically well-designed, small camera. Canon has set the bar very high with the G1X, towards a new class of cameras beyond the traditional G-series and similar high-end compacts from other brands, based on the superb image quality that comes from a large image sensor. Strange thing is: you wouldn't know it from many of the reviews listed on the Amazon site. In that sense, for those contemplating purchasing the G1X, I recommend you do your homework well and read through the clutter of personal opinions guised as reviews on the Amazon site for the G1X, some of which are particularly harsh in their assessment.Why does the G1X elicit such unhelpful reviews? In part, I think, this comes from the hefty price tag ($799) Canon put on the G1X when it was originally introduced. Fortunately, the price come down significantly since then, but it is still well above prices of other high-end competitors. Paradoxically, some of the most negative reviews come from the customer base specifically targeted by the G1X (advanced photographers who wish to add a smaller, portable camera to their DSLR arsenal without significantly compromising on image quality, Hogan's Compact Camera Challenge, see Yang Wang review). Indeed, for those used to DSLR handling, I could see that the G1X might appear slow. This might be true for Canon G-series users as well. I have tested the G15 in the store, and it does appear snappier than the G1X. The added ability to focus down to 1 cm from the lens surface in macro setting on the G15 (not possible with the G1X) could easily make the G15 seem more advanced. But remember, that picture on the G15 (close up or faraway) is captured by a sensor merely 1/6th the size of the G1X sensor (and the G15 sensor is large compared to earlier point-and-shoots and more recent cameras with extremely large zoom ranges). In the end, the large sensor size wins out in most, if not all, circumstances when it comes to image quality, something many DSLR owners attest to and consider an apriori fact in their product reviews of compact cameras. So, if close-ups are your primary interest, the G15 and a series of other great cameras (and they are truly marvels of modern camera technology) is available for you, as well as DSLRs equipped with a macro lens. If your interest is in creative high-resolution photography without the weight burden of a DSLR with added lenses, the G1X deserves your utmost attention.There are fortunately balanced reviews of the G1X as well. Of reviews listed on the Amazon site you need to select carefully and carefully evaluate their content. Helpful comments have recently been added to some reviews (in the comment section) by R. Schwarz (Thanks!)--it's worth searching them out to help make up your mind. For those able to read German, I also recommend the review by Bazi on Amazon.de. A rare 5 star appraisal from this well-informed and critical reviewer. Read between the lines and you will come away with a balanced and very positive impression of the G1X.There is no need in this review to list all of the G1X's features--you can find them in the usual places, including YouTube. I make an exception for the focusing \"issue\", which is not an issue at all, but is a topic that has elicited many negative reviews/comments which are easily misunderstood. Wang describes the situation fairly well, but even his/her review draws a line at indoor snapshots.I have owned the G1X for just a short time now, but even in this brief period I have had great results using this camera indoors for photographing my three-year old daughter who literally never sits still. It takes practice and planning to get the right shot, with extensive use of pre-focus by pressing the shutter button halfway and using a small AF window. I have gained experience with this kind of photography using the Canon S90 and find that the focusing capabilities of the G1X exceed those of the S90 by a significant margin. With pre-focus skills in place, you can add continuous AF, servo AF, or tracking AF to your arsenal to get the best shot. You have to decide upfront which AF mode you want to use and serves you best in the situation at hand--there is more than one mode to get good results, but each requires its own strategy. Sound difficult? Not really (read the manual or better yet David Busch's Guide to the G1X (David Busch's Canon PowerShot G1 X Guide to Digital Photography) to understand exactly what each of these AF modes does. Remember too that we are talking about a tool to produce great pictures (photographs) in the G1X, no longer a simple point-and-shoot (although the G1X has simplified AUTO settings that will take automation to its limits should you decide, on occasion, not to make the effort).With the subject moving fast and continuously, at times it is almost inevitable that one has to resort to using a flash to freeze the moment and obtain crisp images. I don't like using the flash because of its intrusive nature, the typical \"flash look\" of pictures taken with frontal illumination ( I am discounting for the moment creative means by which a flash can be used, but which require set up and time) and the inevitable wait for the flash to recharge [my next investment has been a Canon Speedlight to improve this situation]. To my delight, I have found that the G1X offers flash-less photography as an alternative in this difficult shooting situation, making use of the large sensor and cranking up the ISO. For family album use, an ISO setting of 3200 and moderate enlargement (2-3x) yields perfectly acceptable pictures. So now it is possible to use fast shutter speeds indoors and still capture moving subjects sharp, in natural light no less. I tried this earlier with my S90, but the graininess even in small prints precludes this as a viable option. All kinds of variations with added blur are at your fingertips by slowing down the shutter speed, but that is a different subject onto itself. I realize that my \"discovery\" is nothing new to DSLR users, but coming from the compact side, this represents a major breakthrough.I could go on. I have taken pictures in the dark environment of a bedroom at night and come away with atmospheric, \"impossible\" shots--sharp in many details. In summary, I am finding that the G1X enhances my photography capabilities with a big step in directions I have always wanted to go (without resorting to a large DSLR).A major plus of the G1X which it shares with the G15 and other high-end compacts, is the direct accessibility to shooting parameters without the need to go through menus. If there is one thing I would like to add to the palette of the G1X, it would be direct control of the flash output. Shooting in natural light has major advantages, but occasionally could benefit from a slight touch of fill-in flash. Unfortunately, flash output control is not among the functions that can be assigned to the free choice \"S\" button. There are ways to work around it and this minor wish obviously does not detract from my great appreciation of this camera.Finally: other cameras considered before purchasing the G1X include the already mentioned Canon PowerShot G15 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom, the Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD, the Nikon COOLPIX P7700 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD, Fujifilm X10 12 MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera with f2.0-f2.8 4x Optical Zoom Lens and 2.8-Inch LCD, and Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x Zoom. All of these are wonderful cameras; however, apart from the Sony DSC-RX100, they all feature a small sensor size. The Canons fell out because, in the end, they provide similar image quality as the S90 which I already own and hold very dear, the major difference being greater handling convenience (slightly better image quality perhaps with the G15). In the case of the G15 I had trouble holding the camera with one hand using the grip without touching other controls (it was hit or miss). The RX100 is handsome and compact, but lacks the optical viewfinder and articulating screen found on the G1X, which I both like. Being a Canon owner I had trouble making sense of the electronic menus as well; however, that shouldn't be an issue for RX100 owners. Although the G1X viewfinder is simple (and has been derided in some reviews as useless), it is available, provides LED signals for focus lock and flash charging, and in times of bright sunlight or low remaining battery life, provides the opportunity to continue to take pictures. The camera staying longest in the mix was the Coolpix 7700, which is in effect a simpler version of the G1X with many of the same features. In the end, the somewhat sluggish electronics made me decide against the Nikon and once I managed to pierce through the misinformation of negative G1X reviews, the large sensor size and sturdy grip completely won me over.

I researched all the options and available choices, including Leica, but decided the larger format sensor of the G1X (and its image quality) was worth more to me than the features of other cameras, such as longer zoom or full macro capability or lightning fast focus.I was not disappointed. The camera is compact, takes great images, and the detail and colors are quite wonderful and acceptable for a semi-retired pro photojournalist used to Nikon full DSLR equipment. I transferred the images each night to my iPad using the small Apple iPad Camera Connection device and could see the rich detail and colors of my images in a larger screen while enjoying a glass of Sancerre rose.I won't use or recommend a digital camera without a viewfinder for all of the obvious reasons. Framing an image holding a camera at arm's length is so iffy and ridiculously absurd. The G1X never let me down as long as I did not expect great macro ability, the battery lasted way beyond my daily needs, and the combination of the iPad, connector, and camera provided me a full digital imaging system in a small package. Great set up for traveling without the heavy photo gear bag.I did not ever feel the need for a second battery, the 32GB SD card was way overkill given that I transferred images to my iPad and iCloud then deleted the images from the card  every day. The image quality is sufficient for even professional use. I intend to use this camera to supplement my regular gear when I am shooting articles that don't require the full tripod, multiple flash and other demands of my D2X equipment.Very happy with this camera, rugged and weather resistant in normal use, and with more features than I used.

It is a keeper.Postscript: I just received the aftermarket accessory EZFoto Auto Lens Cap I ordered for this camera from Amazon, which replaces the snap-on cap that is on a cord that comes with the camera. As noted in many of the product reviews of this accessory lens cap, it fits too loosely and will easily fall off as is.However, I put a strip of decorative plastic tape along the inner surface of the cover (slightly reducing its inner diameter that fits onto the camera) and now it fits nice and snug...no way will it fall off.

Perhaps you want a second camera that's more portable than your SLR, or perhaps you want the convenience of a single camera with lens so you can travel light and not carry an assortment of other items, regardless of how small they may be.  If that's the case, you'll probably love the G1X.On the other hand...if camera performance (features, speed, \"user experience\") mean a lot to you--more than ultimate image quality--the G1X won't cut it, period.  I'm in the first category and the only reason I hadn't tried a G1X sooner is the price.  Although I adore the images from this camera, I still can't recommend it unless the price comes down or you snag a rebate as I did, cutting the cost in half.What's so great about the G1X?  It's got a decent sized sensor, period.  How much difference does this make?  It makes all the difference.  Unlike the number of megapixels where more is often but not always better, a bigger sensor is always better.  Always.  There are plenty of digital pocket cameras with sharp lenses, but that's not the point.  There are limitations on how much detail a sensor can record and if your subject has lots of fine detail, a small sensor will produce sharp photos that still lack detail.  It's that simple.  If you take a picture of a person and their face fills the entire frame, you'll get great results even with a cell phone.  But take a photo of a dozen people, standing side by side and you'll be lucky to recognize who they are.  Same applies to nature photography.  Take a photo of a leaf and any camera will do.  Take a photo of a row of trees in the distance and the small camera won't capture enough information.  Of course this is nothing new and why Ansel Adams preferred a 4x5 camera to a 35mm.Image quality from the G1X really is outstanding and the reviews of this camera do it a disservice when they say \"The larger sensor gives better image quality but this is offset by the much faster lenses on small cameras that allow lower ISOs\".  False.  It is true that high ISOs spoil image quality so yes, it's great to have a lens fast enough to permit using a low ISO.  But the G1X will capture more detail (call it sharpness if you wish) at ISO 1000 than a small camera will get at ISO 200.  Bigger is better and it's why people pay an extra $500-2000 for a full-frame SLR instead of a perfectly good smaller SLR.So, if you're happy with the images you're getting from your S95/S100, Ricoh GR, Fuji X10, Lumix LX5, Olympus XZ-1, etc. my advice is to not even look at the G1X.  OTOH, if you don't mind carrying a bit more and you're not in a hurry when you take pictures, you will not be disappointed.Just so we're clear, a list of pros and cons.Cons:  Bigger & heavier than most compacts, slow focusing, somewhat slow lens, very limited close focus (even with the excellent 250D accessory lens), slow writing to card, almost all jpeg adjustments locked out when shooting RAW+JPEG simultaneously, oversharpens jpegs, clips highlights if you're not careful, optical finder doesn't show entire image.Pros:  Truly high quality images that look nothing like what you get used to with a smaller camera (yes, they are better than the Sony RX100, and it's pretty good), sharp lens, effective image stabilization, fold out LCD, finder better than nothing when the sun's behind you and you can't see the LCD.With more processing power and a $550-650 price tag, the G1X would be perfect.  As it is, you'll have to decide if the image quality outweighs the long list of shortcomings.  I look at it the other way.

The overwhelming majority of my use is for posting photos of social group events at the meetup dot com social networking site.  As such, high ISO capability and ability to use a camera without flash are extremely important factors for me. One COULD make a case that any high end compact would likely be good enough for this specific purpose, which is one reason it took me so long to commit to purchasing this camera. I was waiting forever for the XZ-2 to be reviewed...much less come out (which apparently will happen tomorrow, Dec. 5) and was not sure the usual suspects (G15, P7700, LX7, or RX100) would serve my needs.  In late October, I purchased the camera for $599 in person at Adorama in NYC, which was too tempting to ignore and would also complement the 320EX Speedlight that I already had in my possession from the G12.In addition to social events, I do take limited pictures of landscapes at social events outdoors, as well as some family and extended family-oriented gatherings.  As such, this camera has served me fairly well so far over a couple hundred shots -- much more so than three other cameras that I have used in recent years (Canon A590, Nikon D3000, Canon G12). When rating the camera, I would've been inclined to rate this between three-and-a-half and four stars (3.75), but gave the rounded-off score of four stars because image quality IS the number one issue for me.  Please note the pros and cons below as it relates to how I use this camera (mainly for group and portrait shots):----------POSITIVES:1) Most importantly, image quality and resolution are fantastic, as most people online have attested to -- even in the negative reviews.2) As far as I am concerned, if I was buying right now and seeing the December Holiday prices at Adorama flirt with record lows between $549-$599 (I bought it for the latter price in October) puts this camera in a different category/segment with strong reconsideration than if I was considering this camera in April 2012.3) ISO for my purposes seems usable up to 8000 in somewhat low light if I want to do heavy Topaz DeNoise reduction later.4) Shots are usable without flash unless severely dim environment.5) Image stabilization seems really good.  Too bad I usually have to normally skewer higher (1/30-1/100) because I have to worry about subject motion and not camera motion.6) Auto white balance seems very accurate most of the time. However, not sure how much more improvement I would be seeing more often if I shot some Smart Auto shots to activate the DIGIC 5 \"Multi Area White Balance\" option.7) Have always thoroughly appreciated Canon's user interface and menu structures.8) Color accuracy and saturation when processing RAW in Digital Photo Professional looks more natural than other cameras, even if that means less \"pop\" -- scowling at YOU, RX-100.  This is using the \"faithful\" picture style in the application and relatively light sharpening (unsharp mask at +3 strength with +2 or +3 fineness). However, I need to use JPEG more for a more complete opinion concerning this overall issue.9) More or less has the chock full of external controls and buttons that the G12 had.10) Pop up flash seems to have almost eliminated the red eye that I got with the poorly placed flash on the G12.  This is for those few times I use the pop up flash, of course.  Big plus is that G1-X is much more - physically - appropriate for the 320EX than the G12 ever was.11) When occasionally inspecting and/or cleaning lens, I am not getting the (removable) scratches I was getting with the G12.  Although this was likely the shutter-to-lens (physical) distance issue that received much attention, I do wonder if the lens itself is inherently more durable against light cleaning with wet lens tissue.12) 14 MP allows for additional cropping freedom compared to small-sensor as well as small MP cameras.  Important given that I am often restrained from using my feet to reduce distance between subject(s) and camera at social events/gatherings.  Another advantage of the big sensor, high MP camera for me -- despite my not using the camera (almost at all) for prints.-----------------------------NEITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE:1)  28-112 zoom good enough, though teleconverter and digital zoom usable for even more distance.  Only P7700 long zoom range, G15 zoom range and RX100 Clear Image Zoom kept me reconsidering this issue over and over.2)  Although somewhat bulky and slightly heavy (especially to bring to social functions), that downside is offset by the fact that I like to use the camera ergonomically and very much appreciate the articulated screen. Generally speaking, has SOMEWHAT successfully (thus, neither positive nor negative) married my ideal of a fixed lens package containing big sensor and high quality lens.3)  Got rid of that annoying lens cap (much more fiddly and worse than the Nikon D3000 lens cap as I recall).  Replaced with the JCC auto lens cap, which is okay.4)  Only once made the mistake of hitting the video button next to where the right thumb would sit...still...it's too darn close.5)  Don't care about the camera's video function and/or limitations, as I MIGHT use it once during its lifetime.----------NEGATIVES:1)  Yeah, that AF illumination light is damn well bright and white.  I'm going to have to sacrifice it and continue to hope that using a combination of continuous AF with the small AF frame can make up for that in various indoor environments. After all, one of my goals is to use flash as little as possible to avoid annoying my subject(s).  As such, too bad the illumination light is likely worse than most cameras on the market.2)  The few times when I do wish to catch something in a bit of motion (dance floor, movement in a club/bar environment), I have been disappointed in AF lag.3)  Is it just me (since I don't know) or might Canon have worse face detection accuracy and hold (individual and multiple) with the G12 and G1-X than other brands and camera?4)  Bracketing options are severely hindered due to lack of good continuous shooting. Partially offset by the fact that I have less need for this than other people.5)  Slight negative, but noticed by myself and in reviews is that when half-pressing the shutter button, there is less resistance than with other cameras -- even the older Canons.  As such, I have quickly gotten used to that and have rarely experienced the half-presses that turn into - accidental - full presses of the shutter button.6)  Battery life has initially seemed pretty bad (under 200 shots) until I started using a tip I read on dpreview concerning setting screen brightness at the lowest amount in order to BEST judge actual image exposure.  Still, battery life is disgraceful for a professional camera.7)  Do I really need to say anything about the optical viewfinder that hasn't been said anywhere and everywhere (such trash) other than the fact that I would almost never need it (unless facing a blazing sun outdoors and blinded...and then would still try the LCD screen first)?8)  Auto ISO at 1600, Boo!  Luckily, I am usually a Manual or Shutter Speed Priority person, but for those rare occasions where I might thrust the mode into Auto when hurrying...9)  No TTL flash exposure in Manual Mode?  Luckily, this rarely would affect me, given my rare use of the Speedlight. Even then, probably more likely to shoot Shutter Priority.10)  Recently discovered the confusing limitations when trying to determine whether to use Macro versus Normal distance when taking close-up shots of my cats.  Again, luckily this is not a severe limitation considering my shooting, UNLESS I find a situation when I am sitting too close to someone at a dinner table and want to take a shot.  I guess I would shoot normal and relatively wide angle (to allow for shorter distance) and then crop later, but that slows down PP.  Nonetheless, an unnecessary burden having to worry this much more than even an SLR -- and they have similar problems with this.11)  Would have liked the option of somehow fitting Polarized filters DIRECTLY on camera...and especially if I could also keep the auto lens cap as well.

Its image stabilization is well up to Canon standards.  Its color rendition of things like flowers is spot on.Now for the \"but\".It is sloooow, oh so sloooow.  If your subject is moving any faster than a tree, forget it.  Delay between pushing the shutter button and actual operation of the shutter can often be measured in seconds.  After the shot is acutally taken, the cycle time to be ready for the next shot can also be measured in seconds.  I tried taking some shots of my 20 month old grandson.  I got 0 for 8.

Some say the lens is slow and I would say it is not in practice. Some would say AF is slow and again, I would argue it's not the AF, it's the confirmation. I have yet to take a shot that is not in focus, even before the confirmation.Here's the thing though, when you look at the images from this camera, especially if you post process the RAW files, they are simply stunning (JPEGs are great as well)! If the so called \"slow\" lens and AF are having any effect on Image Quality, then I certainly don't see where. And isn't that what we all want from our cameras? This camera is so good at taking pictures, you will soon be wondering how much you can get for your DSLR on the used camera market. If you compare sharpness and noise levels at even ISO 1600 and above to cameras that cost much, much more, you will be impressed. BTW, the G1-X is quite amazing in low light. The super strong AF assist light makes AF a snap. I don't see where any reviews can justify slow AF in low light and the image brightness is up there with any of the so-called \"bright\" lenses.In addition, this camera is built like no other camera. A solid feel that fits the hand well. I love the cold metal feel to the touch and the articulated screen can be reversed to protect the LCD panel from abuse. Sure, you can drop $700 on a T3i or D3200 and get some improved speed (but not more sharpness or lower noise) but, those cameras are bulky and have a cheap feel and \"plasticy\" in comparison as well as being handicapped with low performance kit lenses so, you'll be dropping big money into glass soon enough.Bottom line: Ounce for ounce and dollar for dollar, no other camera comes close to the G1-X in image quality and usability (do the comparison).

And although the price is still high considering that one can get a DSLR or Micro Four-thirds for the same price, even at the current price, it cannot really be compared, except in sensor size.The camera is surprisingly heavy for its size. No it is not huge as others have described it, but it is heavy for its size... about a pound. It feels perfect in my large hands... like it was made for my hands. It is thoughtfully laid out and I love the convenient exposure wheel always available.I have owned and tested 35 digital cameras in the past 20 years. I love my Nikon D600 but with lenses, it is just too heavy to take on trips other than by car. My Olympus EPL1 is also great, but again, lenses to take. This G1X is the perfect compromise... no lenses to change, great image quality, and decent optical zoom.The viewfinder has been described countless times as \"totally useless\" and \"a joke.\" It is neither. In bright light it is invaluable. No it is not like the optical viewfinders of most other cameras, but Canon could have left it off since it does not compare. Instead they included a less than perfect viewfinder that is essential in a camera of this type.Unlike other reviewers, professional and otherwise, I have had no problem focusing in low light WITHOUT even the focus beam turned on (my unit was made in Japan if that makes a difference). And when I say low light I am talking about a room lit with little more than a computer monitor. I have also read many reviews about slow focusing. Since I am patient with photography and accept the fact that making pictures is an art-form, I do not even notice slowness in focusing. So the biggest criticisms are not at all evident or relevant for me.Who cares if a camera takes 1 second to focus vs. 3/4 of a second! This camera is not designed for sports photography so expecting it to do that kind of job is delusional.The huge sensor does a great job. I tested it up to 6,400 ISO and the pictures were fine on a monitor at full zoom. I do not print so I do not care about the print quality.It appears to me that all the criticisms of this camera amount to nitpicking, defective units, buyers remorse, etc. At the current price, the camera is certainly a good deal for such a large sensor with such versatility. I have given five stars to few cameras and this is one of them. I am thrilled with my purchase.I have not been a fan of Canons in the past ten years since other makers have had better offerings with more advanced technology and optics; in fact, I have sold every Canon I have tested. This one, however, is a keeper.This is the perfect camera for landscape shooters, travelers, and those who want exceptional quality images. It is a camera for the perfectionist. It is not a camera for shooting kids, pets, sports, or those who want fast and dirty images.The only real negative for me is the jpeg compression engine which, even at the best settings, produces images of just 2.4 - 4.0 mb. Extra fine should be an option, but can only be achieved with a firmware cracking.UPDATE: Just returned from a three week visit to the UK and due to weight constraints, I only took this camera and a Canon 260SX. I am sorry I took any pics with the 260SX since the difference was astounding but not very surprising. I did not have one bad picture with the G1X out of over 1,200 and tone mapping with Photomatix made them pop. They were all very sharp and beautiful. I do not do closeups so that was not an issue and since landscapes require patience, there was no problem with the somewhat slow focus.

Still I have no problem carrying the camera around all day, and when it's in a case I barely notice it's on me at all, something that cannot be said for my Canon 7D.  Build quality is very high and the materials are all appropriate for this class of camera.  With that said, I returned the first G1 X I received as it had a few dust specs in the lens.  One minor annoyance is that the included lens cap is very finicky to put on, and sometimes comes off inadvertently.In use the G1 X is a pleasure.  It's positively covered in buttons and dials, and makes adjusting settings on the fly easy and intuitive.  I'm especially fond of the exposure compensation dial.  All of the manual controls you'd expect on an enthusiast level camera are also accounted for, including a hot shoe.  The high-resolution LCD screen is a joy to behold, and the swivel feature, although not something I use all the time, is worth its weight in gold when you do need it.  I also really like the unobtrusive electronic level that can be displayed on the screen.  As far as I'm concerned the small optical viewfinder borders on useless and I'd gladly be rid of it to cut down on the size of the G1 X.  Also, the front grip is a small; it could stand to be a bit deeper and less square edged.Speed-wise the G1 X is kind of a mixed bag.  It turns on quickly, and changing settings and navigating the menu is also swift.  Focus speed is where the G1 X falls behind.  I'm not sure if it's a function of the large sensor/lens, but it takes about 1-2 seconds before the G1 X will lock focus.  Compared to my 7D or even some of my point and shoot cameras, that's pretty pokey.  The one nice thing is that as light levels drop it doesn't take any longer to lock focus.  Moreover, the focus is very accurate, so at least it's worth the wait.  Continuous shooting speeds are also mediocre, at about 1 JPEG every second.Photo quality is where the G1 X shows its mettle, as it should due to its large sensor.  You'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between a photo I took with the G1 X and my Canon 7D (unless I was using a very high quality lens), and it's a huge step up compared to the Panasonic GF3.  Indeed, high ISO noise might actually be better on the G1 X than the 7D.  I feel comfortable shooting all the way up to ISO 3200 and knowing that I'll still be able to make a fairly large print with the photo.  Detail and sharpness, especially at low ISO is phenomenal.  Exposure, color, and focus are hardly ever an issue as well.  Unfortunately, the lens on the front of this excellent sensor has fairly basic specs.  In macro mode you can't get too close, and you'll be switching into macro mode a lot.  Also, the aperture range (f/2.8-f/5.8) is not that great.  Still, because of the large sensor you can get nice depth of field, and the image stabilizer helps to compensate for the aperture's modest light gathering capabilities.  Movie quality is good.  Movies are shot in high definition with stereo sound and you can use the optical zoom while filming.Battery life is good.  I was able to take a couple of hundred shots, with lots of reviewing of photos, before I needed to charge the battery.All in all...for general photography where speed isn't an issue, you can't go wrong with the G1 X.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera for specific photographers!", "Author": "Jay B. \"Amateur Image Creator\"", "ReviewID": "RC3XAIU7PMAA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Who am I talking about?

IQ is outstanding. Its near-APSC sized sensor allows for huge resolution, while its Digic 5 processor guarantees quality images. What I've done is simply unbelievable for a camera of this kind. I'd say this has been a perfect camera for a trip with the wife (therefore not primarily a \"photographic\" journey), where it not for TWO drawbacks.Drawbacks:- The G1X shoots video full HD and while DSLRs cannot autofocus while filming, the G1X can, which - again due to its near-DSLR sized sensor and advanced processor -  makes for a huge improvement. However all video settings are  AUTOMATIC. This is a big problem, since you cannot change aperture settings, the camera does it for you. Therefore, a dark setting gets unnaturally bright, and if you pan towards a clearer scene, the take can go up to near white until the camera finds the right settings. This could be settled, I think, with a firmware upgrade the same way Canon did for many video functions with its original 5DMKII.- A huge problem is using a polarized filter. You can attach a 58mm Pol. filter, but you need a cheap $30 plastic adapter that's not available and is very hard to find. Now, for many photographers the use of  a Pol. filter is a must. While theoretically you can do it with the G1X, in fact it'll be quite sometime until this adapter is commonly available. This problem is easier to fix than an automatic override upgrade for the camera. But it seems Canon policy is launching expensive products while dragging its feet when it comes to accessories.

It looks and feels very solidly constructed. It has a very nice grip and is quite easy to hold. The LCD display is quite crisp and view able even in bright sunlight. The controls have a very solid feel. It has many of the features you might expect in a DSLR with a builtin lens. The test images looked sharp even at a higher ISO there was less noise then I would get with my S95 at same setting. The video was also very good and the separate video control button was easy to push. Now with that said, here are my disappointments.1. The viewfinder like a typical rangefinder viewfinder shows an appoximate view of the scene with no data. What is worse is the lower left quadrant is cut off at all zoom positions. There is a light present to the right of the viewfinder that is similar to other G series that indicates correct focus. This is visible from the corner of your eye. Had Canon chosen to incorporate an electronic viewfinder (EVF) which is a minature view of LCD display, this camera would be much more usable.2. The camera with the battery is heavy at 1 1/4 pounds. The Canon 60 D without lens weights just 3 ounces more as a comparison. The Canon S95 weights 7 ounces or 1/3 the weight. Why is this important?....You really can't stick this in your pocket, it's just too big and heavy. You need to wear it like a DSLR.3. For lens shade or filters you need special adaptors and you can't use both together. That is a shame. They seem to be hard to find now.4. Macro pictures can be taken in the wide setting but you need to move far away when you use the zoom. It is not impossible as has been suggested but it takes getting used to.5. Canon removed the useful ISO control which is on my G11 camera. I miss that!6. The lens cap is a small snap on variety that is a pain to use. It dangles from the camera on a little cord.7. The pop up flash has a separate slide switch which is better than the popup on my S95. Better to use off camera flash.8. The G1X maybe worth the $799 in quality and pro like features but it is very very pricey and maybe too much for what it offers.I mention these disappointments that I had but they may mean nothing to you. This is a great compact camera that takes wonderful video and images and if you need that extra image quality in a compact camera, this is not a bad choice and could be the best compact digital camera out there, but not for me. I'm going to stick with my Canon S95 and my super zoom Panasonic FZ150 which is like a compact DSLR with EVF which is light weight and perfect for travel. If I feel like lugging a DSLR and lenses I will take my Canon 60D and Canon 18-200is. The latter two cameras have real viewfinders that makes a real difference in picture taking. I still rather sacrifice superior image quality for an easy to carry camera that I can take anywhere and take as many candid photos as I like. The G1x could still be the ideal camera for many people that do not need the extra zoom you can get with a bridge camera or dslr with long zoom. If the next iteration of this camera would include an EVF viewfinder, slightly longer zoom (5X)and a similar price, I would want to try that camera again!Update 1/2/2013It has been over 8 months since trying out the G1x. I am still searching for the elusive perfect camera, one that has a larger sensor, lighter than an entry level dslr with great ergonomics and prosumer like options with builtin zoom lens and reasonable price. There still is not one out there yet. The canon S95 is still the best of the subcompacts but it has no viewfinder. So far the closest camera I have found is the micro 4 third cameras with their much larger sensor than the compact cameras but smaller than a dslr sensor. I've tried the Panasonic GH2 camera which has a superior evf viewfinder perhaps better than most entry level dslr's and many prosumer like functions. Mated with non kit lens, it takes superior images. It is much heavier than G1x and much more expensive (3X)if mated with a similar type of zoom lens.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price is right!", "Author": "Dan Leithauser", "ReviewID": "RIODRTQ7EPWCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Remember the Kodak Pocket Instamatic 20 camera?

When digital came around, with the infinite pre and post processing available along with being able to take multiple test pictures without the cost of film...there was no choice but to change over.Over time this reviewer has had many portable cameras, most of them Canons, including a Canon Pro90, PowerShot A650, PowerShot G6 and G10, and now a G1X.  Additionally, this reviewer also has a first gen 5D and a 50D.  Each of these cameras had or has its advantages at the time it was purchased.When the G1X was introduced early in 2012, it cost $800.  While praised for image quality (especially in unassisted low light) and innovative sensor tech in a smaller package, comments like \"designed by engineers but not for consumers\" alongside \"Canon has created its own market segment\" distorted an already crowded market.  Many reviewers rightly balked at the price vs value range. The G1X, even at $750, is in some company making the choices among 4/3, smaller and larger DLSR's, and today the Sony RX100 II, much more difficult.The G1X has image quality and Canon's operating system on its side.  It also has high quality construction that comes with some heft and size, not really \"pocketable\" but certainly portable;  which some users will find reassuring along with providing a bit more hand hold.Thinking about other options included the now acclaimed, Sony RX100-2 with 20 MP, a deceptively small form containing lots of features, and with excellent low light capabilities. For this photographer, the Sony was just too small, without a fully articulated view screen, and without a good way to use filters (sticky attachable adapters do not work for this user).  That choice would have been much harder if the price for the G1X was still the original price of $750 (the current price of the Sony RX100-2), but at $600 for the G1X, the price was right. Another option, the new (and more expensive) Canon Rebel SL1, which is really not all that compact, especially with more than a pancake lens.  Or the G15 or G16, both great with the right size and feel, but without articulating screens, and really--just not quite the low light capability that this photographer needs.Being able to take higher quality pictures indoors (conventions, festivals, etc) with a discreet camera, no flash, and the necessary ISO was an objective in the current choice of a G1X.  The G10, while capable, was irritating in the significant increase of grain when jumping over ISO 400, to capture stills of slowly moving people in crowds.  And for those reviewers who think the G1X shoots slow, it is a vast improvement over the G10 in a continuous shot mode.  The other things that draw attention are being able to take HDR exposures and macro capabilities (more on macro further down).This reviewer decided at the time to continue with a G10 and wait.  TODAY--the G1X costs $600 here on Amazon.  The wait was over, the cost vs value ratio is well within the mark, even with the Sony RX100 II drawing attention.For those familiar with the Canon menu and operating system, the G10 and G1X are nearly identical. Canon's menu system translates well across their entire line, is intuitive for most users, and makes some complaints about \"no actual included paper manual\" a bit dated. (This user has the downloaded PDF manual on a virtual drive for viewing if necessary on a phone, tablet, or computer). Personal familiarity with how the Canon works in the process of taking a picture, pushed this photographer away from other choices that certainly presented some intriguing options. The G1X is strictly button oriented for navigation (no touch screen).  A minor complaint for this user was the dual use of the back dial which sometimes would be pressed during turning, moving to a different parameter than the one being adjusted.  A lighter hand helped.Across the spectrum of shoot modes there were no surprises.  Additional scene modes, while interesting, and perhaps even used by the average consumer, will probably be used sparingly with all the possibilities of post processing available on the software side.  While there is an HDR picture mode (takes the shots and processed them), the multiple exposure route with post processing software is the one this user prefers for more flexibility.  Another reviewer indicated that these multiple exposure modes should take all three pictures with one press of the button.  That is a great idea, and one I wish I had on my Canon 50D.Macro is a mixed bag.  This reviewer joins the complaints about auto focus distances, inability to properly focus at times, the continuous yellow \"not focused\" warning telling you to back up a little more.  Macro shots are possible, and it is possible to take good macros if you spend time with the composition.  Fast \"catch the bee on the flower\" shots are more difficult.  Forcing the G1X into macro mode helps.  Canon says go to manual focus... sure that works if you are imaging unmoving subjects.... But not much of a workaround.  The best workaround is to use an additional macro front loaded lens which can be inexpensive or expensive depending on your budget (see next paragraph about adaptors).This leads to the other major reason to purchase the Canon G1X... the ability to easily use add-on filters.  No, Canon did not provide a direct way to put 58mm filter on the front lens (which they should have), but for less than $10 you can buy an adapter.  Some adapters work better than others, but so far over the choices of plastic (which almost seem to snap on rather than screw on) to metal (more secure), this user has not had any filters hit the ground.  The second best part was that with a variety of mid end Canon lenses that already used 58 mm sizing, this user did not have to buy a bunch of new filters.  For those macro shots (AND a wide angle) Amazon has an easy to try (RE: inexpensive) option...(although it does have a pesky plastic adapter included...) SaveOn Professional HD Wide Angle Lens w/ Adapter + Macro Close-Up Filter Set + Complete Lens Cleaning Kit w/ Microfiber Cleaning Cloth for Canon PowerShot G1X Digital CamerasWhat about picture quality?  Indoors, under artificial light at 800-1600 ISO, and no flash, the ability to capture and produce great pictures significantly exceeds the G10.  Lower grain, higher details with cropping, lower movement artifacts all were observed, but not directly \"measured\".  For those who like \"measurement\" and quantification of such things, some samples may indicate better low light performance under a number of circumstance than higher MP \"portable\" cameras.  See some direct comparisons under the easily found DPreview for the Sony RX100 M2, along with a variety of other possible comparable cameras.Searching for a suitable camera case?  Prefer smaller? Thought it important to pass along the results of personal research, along with actual purchase and use of these same cases... Here are two options: Lowepro Apex 60 AW -Black  This Lowepro Apex 60 option will just fit the G1X (without a filter attached AND the inner divider cut out--easy to do).  This slightly larger Case Logic case Case Logic SLMC-200 Compact Systems Camera Case (Black) will allow you to drop your camera and one filter (in a slip with adapter attached) into the case (with no cutting).  There are of course a variety of larger bags and cases.The G1X is not the most perfect portable camera.  It is not pocketable.  It is heavy and (maybe) bulky compared to alternatives.  The macro mode makes users unhappy.  It is not a high speed demon like every other Canon DLSR.  It is not the \"latest thing\".  BUT,  the G1X does take awesome pictures even at high ISO.  The G1X is a tank, well built, easily held, and easy to navigate on the fly.  The best part is the price is *now* right at $600-$650... the perfect price point for this high end portable.  4.5/5.0 rounded up.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meets my requirements, Image Quality exceptional", "Author": "Neil Bailey \"neilbailey\"", "ReviewID": "R2A0B0GKY1L0X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 7D with a multitude of lenses, and an Ixus 310HS for travel.

So what do I think?Well firstly the criticisms over poor macro performance, irritating lens cap and weak autofocus are valid, but largely overstated. The Image Quality is first class, and almost matches the 7D (in fact if you're not enlarging beyond A4, probably equals it).

I have now had a chance to test out my new G1X and can happily report I am well pleased with it.  Here are the particular points I like (I share them on the chance there may be others considering the G1X who have similar priorities to mine):1.  Image quality.  The images are definitely richer and more textured compared to those produced by the smaller sensor on the G10.2.  Low light performance.  The quality of images even into the highest ISO ranges (up to 12,800) is quite remarkable.  The \"scene\" setting includes a new option for taking nighttime images without a tripod.  This means much greater capability for getting good shots (even action shots) in low light.3.  Viewfinder.  Although I see a number of reviews knocking the viewfinder, that is all I used on the G10 and all I am likely to use (with very rare exceptions) on the G1X.  In my case, trying to take photos with the LCD panel is very unnatural and very difficult in bright light.  I have a back-up  camera that lacks a viewfinder (I carry it with me on fishing trips) and have missed a number of potentially excellent wildlife shots because I was simply unable to fix the camera on my subject soon enough.4.  Moment Catching.  Some other reviewers have described the G1X as \"slow\" and not a \"moment catcher.\"  I disagree.  I concede it will not focus in the nanosecond required by a DSLR; it may need half a second if you haven't prefocused it already.  However, I find that fully adequate to capture all of the \"moments\" that interest me.5.  Compact.  In contrast to a DSLR, the G1X fits comfortably into a bag I can wear on my belt.  That was one of the attractions to me of the G series cameras: high quality images in a compact package.  The belt bag that fits the G1X well for me is the Lowepro Rezo 60.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good IQ, good build quality, slow performance, poor focusing", "Author": "EK", "ReviewID": "R19TPJ6FE6VQMJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really, really liked this camera, but decided to return it due to focusing issues. There's a lot to love, but it just wasn't for me.First, the good: - Nice image quality, especially distant subjects - Nice handling, especially if you're used to G-series or EOS bodies - Relatively compact, considering the size of the sensor. Low-end dSLR image quality in a smaller package. - Very good low-light performance - Decent (practical) zoom range suitable for the vast majority of needs - Articulating LCD is nice, solid - Has a real thumb dial as well as a wheel in front of the shutter, making it excellent for Manual exposure shooting (one for the f/stop, the other for shutter speed) - Raw modeNow, the bad: - Close focusing ability is horrible compared to other G-series; lens design limitations due to large sensor - Close focusing accuracy is not so good; mine misfocused a lot - Slow slow slow. Slow focus, slow shot-to-shot, slow playback-to-shoot performance - Exposure compenstation dial requires the use of left hand; better to shoot in 'M' and ignore Exp compensation dial altogether; f/stop and shutter speed can be controlled via dial/wheel for one-handed shooting - Depth of field. While the larger sensor provides more bokeh than other G-series cameras, it does not provide enough bokeh to really be that desirable. The larger sensor is also less forgiving than previous G-series with regards to focusing. With mediocre focusing performance, this is a real issue. If you're shooting wide open, zoomed to tele, and/or focusing close, there's a good chance your subject will not be sharp. At least with dSLRs (larger sensors), focusing is far more precise. - Price is too high considering the performance, size, image quality, etc. But then again, Leicas are overpriced too, all things considered :-)I'm a photographer who shoots professionally with Canon 5D2 bodies, and have been shooting Canon SLRs, both film and digital, since the mid-90s. I picked up the G1X after giving my G11 away to a friend. The reason for wanting a smaller camera was mainly for personal projects and lightweight travel where image quality isn't critical (I wouldn't dare shoot a paid commission with anything less than my dSLRs). I think for the price, you could do much better getting a budget Micro Four-Thirds (MFT) body and a lens or two and save a significant amount of money. Either that or an entry level dSLR kit if size isn't too much of an issue. The G1X will probably outperform most MFT bodies in low-light, but for the price, there are simply too many shortcomings. For 30-40% less money, the G1X may be worth it. At its current price, no way.I settled on an Olympus EPL1 with pancake lens and zoom lens for a little more than half the price of the G1X. It doesn't perform as well as the G1X, nor is it built as good, but for the money, I can't complain. Plus the Oly with pancake lens mounted is more compact than the G1X.######################################################################EDIT 6/13/2012: Downgraded to two stars after using the G1X again:* Image quality - 4 stars* Focusing - 2 stars* Speed - 2 stars* Price - 2 star* Size - 1 starSo that's 11 stars/5 = 2.2 stars rounded off to 2 stars.I noticed that the price of the G1X has dropped some twenty bucks. When it goes down another $150, I think it might be a decent buy and perhaps I'll upgrade my rating :-).The reason for this update is that I shot about a hundred frames this evening with a friend's G1X, and it was slower than I remembered (used a Class 10 SD card). Shot indoors, incandescent lighting. Focused quite poorly in this lighting, which is to be expected. This was especially true at closer range (~4 to 8 feet). However, for those images I was able to capture, image quality was quite good, even at ISO1600 (though I missed several shots due to focusing and slowness).I also used another friend's Panasonic GH2 this evening. What a fantastic camera. Fast focus, more compact than the G1X, and the flexibility of the interchangeable lenses are a win win win in my eyes. 20mm/1.7 pancake lens is very compact and much faster than the G1X lens. 14mm-42mm lens is a nice all-around street lens. Longer teles are also available, but I didn't try any; it's nice to have that option though. Image quality was good up to ISO1600. Image quality seems pretty comparable to the G1X, but with more flexibility. I think I just found my next camera. Price for the body only is about the same as the G1X, but I already have some micro four-thirds lenses. The GH2 is a camera I would consider using for certain paid commissions. Maybe not as a primary body, but certainly as a backup to one of my 5D2s. I think I just found my next camera. I still have to try the Olympus OM-D, which another friend of mine raves about.More thoughts...- If you're the type of person who wants good low-light image quality, but don't care about performance, this camera may be for you.- If you like shooting static subjects (not at close range) and can take the time to frame and focus and snap, and don't mind waiting to take another shot after you've chimped the one you just took, this camera may be for you.- If you do like shooting moving subjects, but you have the luxury to prefocus and wait for the \"moment\" (i.e. performer on stage), then this camera may be for you.- If you want to capture dynamic scenes (street photography, kids in action, etc, etc), then look elsewhere. A dSLR would be a better choice if you don't mind going bigger. If you like the idea of carrying something compact, there are better performing cameras out there, many of which are smaller. However, you *might* have to sacrifice a bit of image quality (of which there is plenty) to get there. It's not a deal breaker for me, and it very likely might not be for you either. Look at Olympus/Panasonic micro four thirds cameras and Sony NEX for alternatives.If I was only concerned with photographing static subjects at farther distances, I would give this camera 4 stars (5 stars is reserved for perfection).#######################################################################EDIT 8/2/2012:Price is down to $699 as of today. If it drops another $50 (preferably $100), I just might buy it again as a throw around camera.A friend of mine recently bought the G1X on my recommendation, and he's quite happy with it. He works as an architect/planning consultant who travels a lot. He's not a photographer, but he wanted something with good IQ, and he didn't mind spending the money to get this. He didn't necessarily need compact, but wanted something portable (i.e. smaller than a dSLR). His only complaint is that he wishes the lens was wider, which is understandable considering his interest in architecture. All in all he's happy. He likes being able to take low-light photos going into dusk or indoors, he likes the articulating LCD screen, he likes the build quality and handling, and he likes the size. The video is something he's been happy with too, often panning scenes that his camera can't capture due to lens limitations on the wide end. If he were the type of person to write reviews, he'd probably give this camera 5 stars based on how this camera meets his specific needs as a traveling architectural photographer who shoots static scenes in jpeg.

The G1X offers many features normally found on the larger DSLR's in a much smaller package. The G1X however is probably not the best choice for the photography beginner due to its complexity and price point.I decided to update my review of the G1X to incorporate what I've learned about it over the last 10 months.  This was originally written when I had stepped up from a G12 and before the G15 (which is closer to a G12) was introduced later.The Canon G1X had an original retail price of $799 placing it closer to the price tags of the entry level DSLRs than to your normal point-and-shoot camera.  Amazon currently is running it for $549 and it has been as low as $499 on sale.  Used models can be picked up usually starting at around $450.Canon has a great video on their website which describes the G1X in detail and also the mindset of the engineers and designers responsible for it.Some hand's on observations include:1) The lens is a lot nicer and it basically replicates a EF 28-115mm dSLR (no you can't change the lens) with full-time (turn-off able) power IS which works in video or still mode.The CMOS sensor size means the lens is really a 15.1mm to 60.4mm with a 1.9x crop-factor (compared to a 1.6x on the 7D) or a 4.6x on the G12 with it's 6.1mm lens. This is a big improvement.There is an adapter available to use 58mm standard filters. However, you cannot use the filters and the optional screw on \"tulip-style\" lenshood at the same time. Later I bought a lenscover that retracts similar to the G12/G15. However, using this precludes using the 58mm filters. A CP filter comes in handy.2) Max aperature is up to F/22 from F/8 on the G12 due to that bigger lens.Minimum is a variable F2.8 to 5.8 which makes it the same as a stock lens. I wish they could get the minimum down more, but it is decent in low light.3) The camera feels \"better built\" meaning it feels solid. it is not a typical point and shoot that you will be putting in a normal pocket though. It is quite bulky4) There is a hot shoe and it is compatible Speedlites 270EX and higher. With a 430EX mounted it is very top heavy. However, you can use a ETTL cord for off-camera flash. They also offer a flash bracket to move the flash position to the left of the camera. It does not have full ETTL functionality.5) The in-camera flash now pops up (from behind the Canon logo) and when it is retracted is off.6) The ISO dial is gone from the top of the camera (it is now up arrow on the back) and the exposure compensation dial is now under the settings. The exposure compensation dial now goes -3 to 3 and you can immediately see the impact on the LCD.ISO range is 100-12,100. Auto ISO is adjustable but the max auto is 1600 (I turn mine down to 800 usually). It is not very strong at higher ISO ratings. Of course, I am spoiled to the low light capabilities of the 5D Mark III now. But it is also not a professional level DSLR.7) It shoots RAW (one of the reasons for getting a G-series in the first place) and you can shoot jpeg+RAW and change aspect ratios on the jpeg shots such as my favorite 1:1 \"Photosquared\" shots.8) 14.3MP is nice and allows you to easily crop in on shots and still have good detail.9) I do not do much video yet, but you can start filming with the push of a button from any mode on the camera instead of having to go to film mode.

When it comes to image quality, this camera far exceeds my Canon G9, and is not noticeably worse in any way besides being larger (and more expensive (and I guess macro shots which I don't care much about)).I come at this as a person who cares a lot about image quality, takes thousands of photos a year, but have never wanted to be burdened with lugging around a DSLR everywhere.  My initial interest in photography was landscapes but now I have a 2 year old son so I spend a lot of time taking kid photos too.Kids are really hard to photograph since they are always moving and have no interest in looking at the camera, so I was worried about the slowness of the G1 X mentioned in many reviews.  In terms of speed/auto-focus, the G1 X feels roughly the same as my G9 and any other compact camera I have owned.  The tracking auto-focus feature is great for kids and an improvement over my G9.  Also, the high ISO performance allows me to take photos I wouldn't have even tried with any of my previous cameras.  Most importantly though, when I do manage to get a photo of my son where his eyes aren't half closed, the quality is amazing.Other random thoughts:- Lens cap is kind of a pain but I'll get used to it.- Despite having a higher resolution and capturing more detail, the jpg image file sizes are significantly smaller than those from my G9.- When I zoom in on a photo of a blue sky taken by my G1 X it is solid blue.  Photos from my G9 always had a certain amount of noise, even in bright light.  This is just one example of the obvious improvement the G1 X makes in clarity and detail.In short:  No camera is perfect and the G1 X does not cure all the drawbacks of a compact camera as compared to a DSLR.  It does take a giant leap in terms of image quality and high ISO performance, and for that reason, I don't think I could go back to using a \"normal\" compact.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Learning Curve with Beautiful Pictures", "Author": "Steven R.

I have to say, I was not disappointed with the beautiful shots I got with it. Gorgeous, and sometimes very surprisingly good results. Strengths: I could carry it everywhere I went with ease, compared to my traveling companion's DSLR and lenses. It feels substantial, like it is made for travel. Not so small that the fumble fingered like me might drop it. I really like some of the not so talked-about features like the auto level and the large bright viewscreen. I love the huge sensor aspect of this camera. The high ISO shots, that I became more and more comfortable with, allow a great latitude of inside shooting without flash. Surprisingly low noise results from those shots (museums, pubs, hotels) really raised the value of the camera in my estimation. Also, the landscape shots in the mountains and along the seaside are absolutely stunning. Again, the large sensor and high quality lens shine in this scenario. The flip screen came into it's own in the downtown crowds. I learned that I could shoot sideways, overhead, waist level and often no one was the wiser. I got much better candids than had I put the camera up to my face and pointed straight on. For crowd shots, this flip screen is tremendous.  Downsides: There's a learning curve. Which of the settings is best requires some planning. I learned that I got better results from utilizing aperture preferred and manual settings than allowing it to do it's own thing. Maybe it's just me, and there are a myriad of ways to tweak this thing, even in it's basic point and shoot modes, but it's hard to remember it all on the fly. I bought and read Dave Bush's book on the G1X but there are just so many options and variables that it's difficult to remember. Also, the menu system is not as easily intuitive as it could have been. I'd like to see a more easily navigable menu. Also, as many have pointed out, the macro is pretty difficult and not very macro. There's lots of info on this. The size and quality of the result allow for plenty of resizing and cropping, but it's not necessarily a true macro. Battery life is limited, but batteries are inexpensive and so you can carry a few. However this begins to defeat the whole reason you might have this thing-- what you are carrying. That is, a comparatively large sensor camera with a great all in one lens in a comparatively small package. I can carry all my stuff in a Lowepro Edit 110 and it fits just beautifully. I'm very glad I bought the G1X, and don't regret the money spent. It's a camera I can grow into and that's why I bought it.

They are uncalled for, and I don't know what the problem could be except.......It is possible, that a buyer could have received a defective camera. After all, like many other products, these camera's are mass produced. I recently purchased a NEX5, and right out of the box, it was bad, BUT BUT BUT, it was not easy to catch. I thought it was just a bad model!  I took it to the camera shop that sold it to me, they discovered it was a bad camera from the factory & sent it back for me. (should have just given me a new camera)This Camera is Perfect. The pictures are every bit as good as my 60D or my NEX5. The controls give me complete control over the camera in a very well layed out system. The camera is very comfortable to hold and work. The only fault I can find is that the movie button is easy to hit because it's close to where your finger rests on the back of the camera.Now, yes, it's not as fast as my 60D. And I haven't really tried the macro yet. I don't do much macro. I didn't think that a P&S; could be like this. If it wasn't for the speed not equaling the SLR's, this camera would be the one to have. Of course there are the different lenses, and much better zooms in the SLR's and the other camera's with those features, but the picture quality is beyond reproach!!!  This camera is a perfect back up, Travel, or carry camera. It is absolutely amazing.UPDATE:  As others have said, and I did believe them from the get-go, This Camera does NOT do Macro. Just doesn't do it. Doesn't focus. And, as others have stated, the lens is not plumbed for a UV filter, so as to protect the lens. (you have to buy an adapter that fits in the 44mm hole, and then buy a 52mm filter to fit in the adapter) The lens cap itself is like you get when you go to the more expensive Good Camera's, so that's not a big deal. I like a bigger camera, it's easier to hold & manipulate, the small camera's are harder to keep hold of. Speed, it's faster than my S95!Although this camera is geared for the right hander, the front right side is a hard rubber for your fingers, and the back has a 3/4 inch square rubber pad for the thumb.You can either run with the LCD turned around so as not to use it, or turn it so you can.

The controls are intuitive and it's very straightforward to use in my favoured \"P\" or \"Av\" modes.  I also like the moveable LCD screen - great for shooting candid shots.  So many positives; I was so close to giving this camera a five star review.So why only four?  Two features let an otherwise fantastic camera down.  Firstly, the optical viewfinder is simply dire.  Canon - what on earth were you thinking when you designed this? The coverage is so much smaller than the actual final image that it makes accurate composition virtually impossible. Yes, I know I can crop off all the other stuff using Lightroom - but why should I waste pixels and image quality?  My second gripe is of less importance, but still irksome - why does the lens not have a simple filter thread to mount a UV filter?Despite these let-downs, I would still recommend this camera as a go-everywhere lightweight compact.

It becomes a hassle to carry more lenses, and sometimes the camera gathers dust.I consider myself an amateur photographer, probably not at level of what people call \"pro-sumer\". I understand the basics of how to create a good photograph, but I just don't take enough photos every day to get to the level of some of the beautiful photos I see there, unless I'm very lucky. So this review is based on being a fairly experienced amateur.I had a nice DSLR with three good lenses, but I was using the smaller zoom lens almost exclusively. I decided that if I was going to take a lot of photos and really get better, I needed a camera that was powerful but a lot smaller. Something I could throw in my messenger bag and take more photos. And I just got annoyed carrying everything I needed to take a decent photo.So, I sold my DSLR, and started the process of which would meet my needs. I wanted it to take outstanding photos, to be well made (of course), and give me a lot of overhead in powerful features that as I improved, I wouldn't be thinking, \"maybe I should have gotten another DSLR.\"I rejected the super zoom cameras, because even though they're great for capturing images far away, they suffer from a tiny imaging sensor, which means that they're not all that great in low light situations. And since I don't do much nature photography where I'm trying to take a photo of some animal 1000 yards away, it really met none of my needs.It came down to the Canon G1 X and the Sony RX-1. Of course, the latter is over $2000, and if I'm going that high, I might consider one of full frame DSLR's or similar. What impressed me about the G1 X were reviews here and elsewhere that seem to indicate professional photographers were carrying it as a backup camera, or one that they carry when they don't need their full kit of lenses and bodies. And although the price is much higher than super zooms and almost any point and shoot camera, I knew I was getting a lot more.All that being said, here's what you should expect from the camera:1. It has one of the largest image sensors available in any camera. It's just slightly smaller than what you would find in a typical DSLR, but larger than you would get with a 4/3 camera and several times larger than what you would get in a $200 point and shoot. This means two things: you get outstanding low light photos, and high ISO performance without a lot of noise and artifacts.2. Build quality is at the level of higher priced Canons. The body is solid metal, instead of plastic. It has nice rubber grips. You don't even find this in lower priced DSLR's.3. User interface, though complex, is intuitive for those who have experience with higher quality digital cameras.4. Compact dimensions, though not as small as one of the generic point and shoots.What I found problematic:1. Big sensors on small cameras give some physics issues, including depth of field. If you love those simple cameras that give you an almost infinite depth of field, this one won't do it. This really isn't a negative, but just a warning if you're looking for a point and shoot camera that is literally that.2. The manual is in a pdf file on a CD. I hate this because sometimes you need to look up something, and either I print out the manual, or open up my iPad to read the manual. By that time, I give up.3. Even though the interface is intuitive, it does take some practice to get the settings right for a particular shot, especially since there is no handy manual. I would suggest one of the guide books when you purchase this camera like David Busch's Canon PowerShot G1 X Guide to Digital Photography. It actually walks you through proper settings to get good photographs.4. I don't like the optical viewfinder. It's basically useless (there's no information or anything there), and when the lens is extended, you can see it in the viewfinder.5. The lens isn't threaded (even though it kind of looks like it does), so you have to purchase an adapter for high quality filters.My conclusion. This isn't your every day point and shoot camera, it is much more advanced. It has a learning curve (which I have found to be a bit lower since obtaining the guide book). If you're looking for a point and shoot, and just think a camera at this price must make it the best one out there, then you are right and wrong. It is in the top two \"point and shoots\", but to get amazing photos, you really have to learn how to use it. Also, you have to understand how to use a compact camera like this with a huge imaging sensor.I'm deducting a star for my issues with the camera, but I believe it is superior to many lower priced DSLR's and 4/3 cameras.

Second, the shutter lag is disturbing, and third, it is too easy to accidentally move the exposure compensation dial without realizing it.  Other than that I like this camera.  The articulated LCD screen is an especially nice feature, and even though most critics are saying the optical viewfinder is useless, I wouldn't buy a camera without one.  Try to actually see an LCD scren on a bright sunny day.  What attracted me to this camera in the first place is its similarity to the rangefinder cameras of the 1950s, which were the first 35 MMs that I became familiar with.  The G1X has that same feel.

Like what everyone says great photos even in very dark environment. However is true that it can get a little tricky to focus on an object, particular a person's face, but only in low light or indoor conditions.

I would say 200 shots at most, but I probably won't take that many shot in one occasion.To sum up, this is probably not a replacement for SLR, but if you want just a good camera to take photos from time to time (or when you go out) and don't want to waste time to manual this or that, that this is a great camera for you.

With the compact design and the large sensor, you can't get good focus up close. A small sensor will give you that, but sacrifice low light and soft background capability in the process.I shoot mostly outdoor architecture and landscape shots, so I was pretty much looking for just this thing. I carry an S95 in my pocket pretty much everywhere I go, but when I'm out sightseeing, the G1x has replaced my T2i for most outings. I have a macro lens for that, so when I'm doing product photography I still have that covered.Here's what I like about the G1x:Love the control layout. For a Canon shooter this camera is already a known quantity before you take it out of the box. Easy to pick up all the controls without even touching the manual.Works with eye-fi card and New Ipad like a charm. It's really fun quick-editing RAW on the spot with Photogene, posting straight to Flickr and sharing on facebook immediately while most others are getting their facebook images from their cellphone cameras. I've been doing this for a year now with the S95, and the G1x really shines here. I hope someone develops a next-gen RAW editor for iPad that really exploits the new processing power and retina display. I'd like a much more thorough sharpening subroutine and many more options for tonemapping. But all in all, the G1x and New iPad seem to be made for each other--smaller than a pro rig and with somewhat limited functionality, but  very good in what they CAN do.Really, really dig the lens. For a Canon, this thing is very sharp. Maybe I got a really good 'un, but man. I'm getting a lot more keepers with this than with the big rig. Strikes a good balance between speed and low distortion and zoom range. Puts a good image on that big sensor. I shoot in Av most of the time, and the built-in ND element inside that lens really slows down a shot and gives me some great effects. Great tripod camera.I also notice the pics come out with much more smoothness and glow than from the S95/G12. The lens/sensor combo here doesn't give you Leica luminosity, but it's really good for a Powershot.Low light performance is fine, but I would have been willing to put up with a bit more distortion for a faster lens. I know the whiz kids at Canon have reasons for every little decision they make on these things, and the compromise is evident. There is no one camera at this price that can give any one shooter everything he wants.Also, did I mention this thing is BIG. I mean, hefty bag here. Feels great in the hand, doesn't let you forget you're shooting a non-DSLR, but really a solid chunk of camera.Compared to the G12, this thing really rocks. Minus the macro ability. I don't use it for that, so I'm getting real joy from it so far. Can't wait for this summer's family reunion. I'll leave the monster and the lenses at home and just take this guy and his little S95 brother along.

But prior to this camera, there was no other way to achieve DSLR image quality -- and not just any DSLR, mind you, but the highest of the high end.The G1 X is close to the same size and weight as my classic Leica Minilux 40mm f/2.4 35mm film camera -- which is to say that it is perfectly portable, and somewhat retro looking. Much more portable than the Sony NEX-style cameras, which are ergonomically horrible with a small body and a big lens attached. You do have to learn how to hold this camera, so that you do not accidentally actuate one of the many buttons, but it's really no big deal.There is a steep learning curve here, as there are dozens of features one can use. For myself, I like to keep it simple. I am not interested in any of the in-camera effects, as this stuff can be applied in your photo software. I wanted first and foremost top image quality, and this baby delivers, big time. And speaking of keeping it simple, shooting superb looking 1080p/24fps video means pushing one button.As far as still photography modes, there is a fully-auto mode that even grandma could use. But really, this isn't a camera for amateurs or those who are unwilling to take the time to learn how to use it to its full capabilities. There are also Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Full Manual modes, with the ability to shoot at very high iso settings with very little loss of quality -- to f/16 (NOTE: I uploaded a pic taken at f/16 -- looks absolutely terrific).Some complain about macro shooting, but with such high image quality, you can get close enough to most any subject, then crop it to your liking. If this is your main interest then look elsewhere.Some also complain about the price. I am reminded of the scene in the classic Albert Brooks film, Lost in America, where he is hesitating buying a Mercedes because of the price. The salesman tells him, \"Well, you can always buy a Nova\". The same applies here. If you want to squeeze the buffalo off a nickel, look elsewhere. There are plenty of cheaper cameras. But if you want superb image quality in as small a package as possible, this is your camera. Break open the piggy bank and enjoy.TIP: I am using the Lowepro Lens Case 9 x 13 cm (Black) as a camera case, which is a perfect fit. I attach the Lowepro via its belt loop to my fanny pack belt so it is always at the ready. There's even a mesh pocket in the top of the case to stash the lens cap.NOTE: I uploaded an image to illustrate the fact that you can get very nice closeup shots with this. Now, the image is not anything special, but no one should shy away from this camera because of negative comments about its macro limitations, thinking that somehow you cannot shoot closeups. As I said in my review, get as close as possible then simply crop the images to bring the small details to the fore.UPDATE 5/23: I just did my first test shots using RAW (I'm still learning!) and WOW WOW WOW! A whole 'nother level of detail! Forget all the whining about \"macro\" because even from several feet away you can bring the smallest detail into sharp focus. If you want to get microscopic, that's another thing entirely. But I cannot imagine that anyone would be disappointed with the level of small detail this camera is capable of producing.UPDATE 5/31: I just got the Lensmate filter adapter recommended by another reviewer along with the B+W 58mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M) and the combo works like a charm!UPDATE 8/14: I am using the B+W 58mm Circular Polarizer with Multi-Resistant Coating and the results are amazing!

I still own my first camera, the Olympus OM2000 (last fully manual film camera from Olympus), and I have owned the Sony S85, Canon 10D, Canon 30D, Canon SX20, Canon A620, and Canon D10.I've learned a few things over the last several months:1)  With a sensor 6 times larger than the G12 and just a bit smaller than my 7D, dynamic range and ISO behavior is excellent -- basically the same as my 7D.  Detail resolution from the lens is on par with the EF-S 15-85.  The weakest focal length according to DxO is around 31mm where the corners are at their softest at the optimum aperture.  At wide and telephoto though the lens is above avaerage and even squeezes more detail than average out of f/16.  With a 4X zoom range, effectively 28-112mm, this makes the G1 X a suitable alternative for my 7D in terms of image quality in many situations.2) The three stop neutral density filter is good for getting longer shutter speeds in somewhat low light.  Only in bright daylight do I need my 10 stop ND filter on the 7D/15-85 in order to get blurred motion in water.  I wish I had realized that when shooting 75 second exposures of Multnomah Falls; one or two seconds would have been fine using the G1 X.3)  The G1 X is a point and shoot with a near-DSLR sized sensor.  This may mean image quality is excellent, but it also has the limitations of both a DSLR and a P&S; all at the same time.  This means:  slower AF than a 7D, longer minimum focus distance for \"macro\" shots than a P&S;, less capable flash than a DSLR (but hotshoe available), and in-camera distortion correction for the miniaturized lens.  All P&S;'s have internal distortion correction to allow for the maximum zoom range to be squeezed from a tiny lens.  DSLR's don't have the same level of distortion.  This is a non-issue.4)  Autofocus has not been much of an issue.  If you use your settings correctly, it's pretty snappy.  Changing the AF point size from large to small can help speed up AF lock.  Leave \"Continuous AF\" on will keep the lens focused always.  This is not the same as Servo AF, which is the tracking mode used while actually shooting.5)  The G1 X is not a small camera.  It is a large P&S.;  Still, it is much more convenient to carry around than a DSLR.  Once I get a belt holster it will be on my belt, not in a pocket.  This is preferable in many situations to a backpack holding my DSLR gear.  Many times over the last month I've had to think about which camera I want to take with me, whereas in the past low light would have required my 7D.  Fast action is still easier with the 7D.5)  Macro shooting is not possible on any point and shoot.  Macro means you are creating a life-size image of the subject on the sensor.  This is usually referred to as a 1X magnification or 1:1 ratio.  In P&S; cameras \"Macro\" is used to refer to close focus distance.  The G1 X does not have the same close focus distance other P&S;'s are capable of.  This is because the large sensor requires a large lens (producing great detail but still highly miniaturized) making close focusing very difficult.  If you've ever shot with a DSLR this comes as absolutely no surprise.  If you want to shoot macro go buy a DSLR and a $1,000 macro lens (for an IS equipped lens, but maybe $500 for a non-IS).If you are thinking about a G1 X you are either a P&S; shooter looking for the best P&S; out there or a DSLR shooter looking for a companion camera that will be easier to carry and won't make you cringe at the image quality even at high ISO's.  The P&S;'s out there should be aware that this camera doesn't have the fastest AF on the market nor the closest \"macro\" focus distance.  The DSLR shooters will probably have an easier time adapting, but maybe not.  Using the articulating LCD does take some getting used to, but that's one reason I bought the G1 X.  I've been able to get some dramatic and different perspectives one can't get looking through a viewfinder.Great camera.Cases and accessories:The Manfrotto Nano VII case is a great belt holster for the G1 X.  The material isn't rigid so despite the very large lens cap protruding you can still close the flap and engage the velcro.  I use the Rezo 110 AW for safe transport and the Nano for use in the field.The Canon filter adapter and Canon lens hood are both of good quality.  The filter adapter material was chosen for a reason, and those like the Lensmate have been known to fit onto the camera too tightly or have issues letting go of filters.  Metal adpaters will wear away the camera's plastic.The Canon underwater housing is the cheapest way to get a waterproof camera of this caliber of image quality.  Also, the Pelican Storm IM2075 is the perfect size to store and transport the underwater housing in.  It has enough height to allow for a good amount of padding on the top and bottom, and enough front to back and side to side padding as well.  Another site recommends the a larger Pelican that barely clears the height of the housing, and is unnecessarily long and wide making travelling with the case a pain....I bought both and take my word for it.  The IM2075 fit in my carry-on bag and allowed for my usual in-flight entertainment devices as well.Addition to macro discussion:Just for reference, the G1 X sensor area is 261.8 sqare mm and at min. focus distance (7.9\") in macro mode it can cover an area of 37,241 square mm for a magnification factor of 0.007X.  Compare this to the SX40 with a magnification factor of 0.019X with a 0\" minimum focus distance, just a bit under 3X that of the G1 X (sensor area is 28.07 square mm and macro coverage is 1,452 square mm).  So even with the subject pressed up against the lens it will not be projected onto the sensor at anywhere near lifesize.  The SX40's tiny sensor and huge zoom range lens also implies the same lacking detail resolution of all such lens/sensor combinations.  The G12 is 0.058X at a minimum focus distance of .39\".  This is why the term \"macro\" is meaningless on a P&S.;", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Oh Canon, you came so close", "Author": "G. Wiman", "ReviewID": "R3E8JF1M72T2J5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera. I own a G11 and absolutely love it*, so I was really looking forward to the G1x. And at first look it was great. Image quality was fantastic especially in low-light (my favorite). It felt very familiar in use, and if you have not experimented with an articulated viewfinder, you are in for a treat. (I'm pretty much done with pentaprism viewfinders.) The construction quality was excellent too; it felt like a real, worthwhile camera.Unfortunately the auto focusing was very weak and slow, and it often simply failed to focus. The specifications said it could get as close as eight inches, but auto focus got even worse at such close range. Even in manual focus mode, it was inconvenient to use that super-sensitive dial wheel on the back of the camera. Perhaps Canon should consider re-purposing the front scroll wheel on the G12 and G1x for manual focus control, and use the rear dial wheel and/or buttons for exposure control.So sadly, I returned it for a refund. I really want a mirrorless camera with a big sensor and an articulated viewfinder. I don't know what I'll end up buying; there doesn't seem to be anything on the market like that right now.(*Except for the manual focus control. This review edited for clarity in several places after R. Schwarz' comment. As originally written, the review was unclear.)UPDATE, 12 December 2012 - I wound up getting a Canon T3i and am very happy with it even though I wasn't planning to buy a dSLR.

I use it mainly when I don't want to lug around my DSLR, but still need pro-level images. The noise at higher ISO's is much better than the G10. The G1 is a bit bulkier and heavier than the G10, but not much. The lens cap isn't the greatest, but I suppose it's one less moving part than the auto-closing one on the G10. The image stabilization and one-button activation of video is an excellent feature. Also, the addition of the swivel=screen is a definite plus for not having to get on my belly for those ground shots. So, overall a great camera.

Photography is a HOBBY to me and that's that. And my purchase of this camera reflects several different things including: price, what I'd use it for and features.First, I want to mention a few things I've noticed about reviews on this camera: slow auto focus, great photo quality and poor macro. I wanted to address those main things from my point of view.SLOW AUTO FOCUS - This is actually TRUE and is not just simply one or few people's opinions. For a camera in this 'class' and with the technology stand-point we are at with digital photography, it  almost seems arbitrary that Canon let this un-detatchable lens be so slow. I've had my hands on a few compact cameras and all of them had super fast auto focusing -- which honestly should be a given for a such a small camera, right? Well....here's the thing though, this camera is NOT THAT SMALL. I know, so many things about this camera seems gimmicky at first, I thought these same things. Why is this camera so HEAVY for a compact?? Compared to many of its competitors, this camera feels like a tank! But I'll get into the build more later. But I agree, that the auto focus is a bit undesirable. Now if you're focusing in manual quite often (as I do) then this shoudln't be a problem anyway. But for $550, you can't really justify such a slow, very crucial function.(I should also mention, I did not order this camera off of Amazon. I actually bought it in store, in person so I knew what I was getting into...)PHOTO QUALITY - As I mentioned, I've played around with my fair share of compacts and in comparison, this camera, in my opinion, has beaten them all in terms of image quality (this is comparing to the Nikon P7800, Lumix LX5, and Olympus XZ-1). I get stunningly sharp jpegs straight out of the camera. Now, this is purely an opinion and again, please note that I am NOT a professional and do not really care for pixel-peeping nor am I anal about specs and IQ. Just know the optics on the lens are high quality and deliver great photos for those who, like myself, are enthusiasts of photography but aren't trying to make a living off it.Most importantly, I shoot mostly in JPEG but am well aware of the difference of RAW quality. I'm just saying, if JPEGS are this good, you can get some serious shots in RAW.POOR MACRO - Okay, wide open this little baby does shoot f/2.8 which seems decent but really isn't very wide in retrospect (my old LUMIX LX5 had an f/2.0 lens and my Olympus XZ-1 with it's fabulous f/1.8 lens and that thing was faaaaast so I knew this wasn't going to be  as \"BOKELICIOUS\" as I wanted it to be...) So if you are even remotely familiar with how wide your lens needs to be in order to achieve shallow depth of field for macro photography, you should already know that 2.8 isn't anything to brag about. But in case you're getting lost in what I'm trying to say......what I'm trying to say is -- I KNEW I WASNT GOING TO GET AMAZING MACRO SHOTS. I had no intention of getting this camera for amazing macro photography to begin with so maybe I'm not so disappointed by it, but YES, the macro isn't that great. However, I like being discreet when I'm shooting. I like using longer fixed length lenses with wider apertures to take close up shots, as opposed to getting all up in that flower's face. It's just not my style of shooting...but to each their own.Now in terms of build and exterior, this thing is...uhhh...how do I describe it....it's like...driving a FIAT. Yes, a FIAT. It's a wonderfully made little European car that is meant to be luxurious but looks kinda weird on the outside. But if you stare at it for a while, it kinda looks...charming? I guess. Yeah, that's a terrible analogy but I can't really think of any. How do I put this.......compared to all the cameras I mentioned before that I've owned/used I think this camera is probably the ugliest looking straight out of the box. The P7800 is not any prettier in my opinion....but has a nice pancake like lens attached to the body so it looks prettier in pictures. But in person, good lord I cannot stand the way the P7800 feels. It's just so gritty and harsh. I don't know...all of this is just personal preference. The G1X has a mostly aluminum body and the black is rich black and matte. It FEELS incredible in my hands and personally, I'm okay with it being a little ugly as long as it feels nice. (Again, \"ugly\" being subjective here...)The only negative thing I can say about the body is the weight. This thing isn't fat, it's just too buff. It's solid and feels expensive for one. I've never owned one but I'd say it's probably comparable to the weight of a Fuji X100. This thing is not for dainty fingers. I know it's kinda weird because it's supposed to be compact and light. My LX5 and XZ-1 were super incredibly light, however, they did not boast the features that this camera has nor the image quality in my opinion.Two words: ELECTRONIC VIEW FINDER and SWIVEL SCREEN (okay, so that's like 5 words..). Call me vain, but I had 100% every intention of utilizing that articulating screen for SELFIES. That's right. I'm in my late 20's but I'm still allowed to use that word okay. Also, I thought it would be a great addition for movies if I ever want to compile a video with friends and what not.The EVF is another reason for additional height and weight of the body and....honestly, it's not that great. It's welcoming though. I haven't used a camera with a view finder since I sold off my Nikon DSLR a few years ago. I rarely shoot in direct sun light (I'm a firm believer in shooting indoors or whenever it's cloudy or overcast....) so I don't feel like the view finders are too crucial for my casual shooting needs. But even pros have stated that this camera is their little DSLR buddy and the crappy vf isn't that big of a deal. The LCD is nice and clear and works well enough for me to get pretty accurate photographs but it's still a bit disappointing that the EVF was soooooo bad. Why is it bad? BECAUSE THE FREAKING LENS IS IN THE WAY OF THE FRAME. I mean, what were you guys thinking at Canon? Did you guys not think that this was important??? There's a big chunk of the lens in the lower left corner of the frame because the viewfinder sits literally right above the lens line. It's just annoying. Do yourself the favor and DO NOT GET THIS CAMERA BECAUSE YOU THINK OH, AN EVF ON A COMPACT CMOS SENSOR. no no no no. It is useless sadly. I will only use it if I absolutely have to.I like to play devil's advocate and question all the bad things before getting to the good parts.And now, the reason WHY I got this camera.I own a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (NX300 Samsung) and I absolutely love that thing. I simply wanted a companion for my baby. I didn't want to get another camera in that class because I'd have to get more lenses for a different camera and excuse me, but I'm not getting paid to do photography and therefore, I can't justify dropping 2G's + on new lens system for another camera. My NX300 suits me just fine and I have some fabulous glass with it. I wanted a non interchangeable lens camera that still had high optics and performance like my little APS-C beauty. This camera simply fit the bill.- It's a bit heavy, but it's solidly constructed. It feels nice in the hands and feels durable and nowhere near being cheap or plasticy.- I like the articulating screen for 'selfies' but for versatility in shooting angles.- A good wide angle lens, perfect for landscapes / street photography (I own a couple of zoom lenses for my NX system along with a portrait lens (85mm) and 45mm and those produce some amaaaazing bokeh. I do not need a replacement for them simply put. I wanted something with a more wide angle)- Don't need to spend any money on more lenses- Easier to take around compared to my NX, because technically it's still smaller than my NX with huge chunky lenses.- Shoots bright, clear, crisp and beautiful jpegs. Don't wanna hassle with RAW. I leave that to my NX for more serious work.- Nice secondary camera that isn't a dumb point & shoot.- Shoots great in low light even in high ISO- Macro shmacro. Macro only is like a cheap way to make all your photos look like \"real photography\" in my opinion. Anyone can shoot macro photos. There's more to photography than macro. I'll leave my NX300 for that stuff. I like my G1 X for casual shooting, street photography, landscapes, people getting crazy at the bar and everything else.In my opinion, all of these features are exactly what I was looking for and I am quite happy with this little beauty. It does have it's flaws (major, some would argue) but it has it's charm as well. Cameras in this class and any other classes of digital cameras are one a dozen. But they all have their unique quirks and features. However, some people give this camera 1 or 2 stars SIMPLY because of the auto focusing issue and then the rest of the camera just seems 'bad' to them. In reality, I can live past the auto focusing. And at the least, when it does focus, images are tack sharp, even for my friend with very shaky hands.I knocked off 1 star for the obvious AUTO FOCUS issue. I just can't justify it to a positive level in any way. even if the auto focus does seem to stabilize images when it's taken, it still shouldn't be an excuse to be that slow. At the price and level of this camera's functionality, I think it deserves a decent auto focus, but it's not detrimental for me to knock off more than one star.I hope this review gives a bit more insight into this camera and hope it helps others. I tried not to be too technical because that's not what I want to highlight. I wanted to highlight the key things that meant something to me as an enthusiast / hobbyist / blogger / that friend with a camera 24/7.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Camera but Miss Macro", "Author": "Joyce B. \"Joyce B.\"", "ReviewID": "RGMJKXCQQPBPR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera rather than the new one coming out or now out.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The G1X is a higher-end fixed lens camera (point and shoot), with 14.3 resolution (megapixels), and x4 zoom. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is 1.5 inch CMOS-type. That is arguably the number that matters most. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor. This is several steps higher, and not far from the top.It also has a viewfinder, which many don't. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does have an external flash option. That is a plus too, especially for portraits. The LCD screen has a 920,000 resolution with a tilt-screen. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 1.9. The camera also does RAW processing which is useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. This is not a light camera for a fixed-lens one, weighing 534 grams. The large sensor is what creates the need for a larger lens and housing and therefore a bigger camera.A great camera.

Thirdly, the lens extends out from the body making it a bit bulky. Lastly the HDR setting gets confused. In scenes with a wide dynamic range, the image recorded looses the dramatic effect of the scene opting for a \"middle of the road\" exposure.

For me it was a combination of size and weight, plus a desire to simplify the decision-making and compromises over lens choice.My DSLR kit is a 400d, with 18-55 and 70-300 twin kit,  plus 17-85, nifty 50 and 40 pancake. The 17-85 was my all around lens until it broke. Plus it had become heavy enough to be annoying. The 40 pancake was my latest foray into creating a 'good, light' combination, but, the lack of zoom...The size and weight of the G1X take a bit of getting used to. It's in constant live view, so the temptation is to use the thumbs on the bottom, fingers on top, P&S; grip, but the G1X first up is too heavy for this. My normal grip is more similar to an SLR grip. For extra stability I use the viewfinder, with a bit of peripheral vision to frame with the LCD. When you get used to it, though, you can use all sorts of positions, such as one handed, or held down at waist level.The sharpness and image detail of the G1X is better than the 400d, thanks to the increase in pixels from 10 to 14 MP. It's pretty cool to get more detail zooming in on my Mac than less, and cropping is a lot more fun. The trade-off is it doesn't handle highlights that well, you have to manage contrasts more carefully. In particular, overcast skies are a double whammy for exposure: subjects are more dimly lit, and the white sky gives off more light than a clear blue sky. I have been having some success, however, with the following settings: mycolor contrast -2, icontrast shadow correction auto, exposure lock on the sky.Results with the built in flash are disappointing compared to the SLR, but that's to be expected. Stay away from light-colored walls, the flash just bounces brightly from the wall, leaving subjects underexposed and skin tones greenish. When I need a bit of extra flash I use Kids and Pets mode.  It's a pity the 2.8 aperture happens only at the widest angle, because you need it when taking indoor portraits, but the perspective makes faces too distorted. For some flash / low light shots I use my C1 mode set to ISO 800, shortcut button to digital tele converter, front scroll wheel to step zoom. I use my external flash more than with the SLR.I've had no problems with macro and focussing speed. I don't do insect macros but the teleconverter is plenty good enough for flower close-ups.Exposure simulation is a big thing. I know most modern cameras have it, but it gives you a lot more confidence in experimenting with manual settings.Overall I find the G1X an excellent learning camera. If you want a point and shot that can handle all conditions, buy an SLR. But if you want a camera that inspires you to walkabout, experiment with subject matter, exposure, and shooting angles, and still get that real-camera feel, the G1X is fills that spot perfectly.You can see my sample pictures under the website link of my profile, or davidsg1x under tinyurl.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "R.

I do own a handful of digital camera bodies though for low light situations, and to offer my clients a choice.  I just picked up the G1x and I have to say, it has turned into my favorite camera.  I still love my film camera, but the G1x is a close second because of its quality.The PROS:  Quality of pictures, low light capability, the ability to go anywhere and to get professional shots without looking like a professional photographer (trust me on this!  You can show up in a mall with a model, shoot like a tourist and security won't even know!)The dynamic range is also incredible.  There's no need to shoot in Raw anymore as your exposure needs to be way off to wash out shots.The CONS:  To embrace this camera, you have to change your workflow.  Because you are not shooting through the lens, you honestly don't have a good idea of what you are composing, especially if you are shooting with an extreme back-lit shot such as a sunset, your subject is completely black.  So what I do is I focus on my subject, hold down the shutter halfway to lock focus, then I look at the subject to make sure they are posed right, then I compose in the LCD and fire.  The workflow is different, not slower.  So this really isn't a con.Also, the LCD is not accurate when it comes to judging exposure, especially whites.  I use a speedlight and many times I'm thinking the whites are getting washed out, when they really are not.  I found that putting the LCD on the lowest brightness settings is pretty close to accurate exposure, but still, it's a little contrasty. Trust your histogram and metering, not the LCD for exposure. If you're shooting with a flash, and there are whites in the image, it's better to underexpose by a quarterstop and correct it in the computer.  In fact, bringing up the exposure in lightroom works really well on 1/4 stop underexposed images.You can view a few of my pictures taken on the G1x here:[...]", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good image quality", "Author": "pvlcek3", "ReviewID": "RQCVVBKPO6FD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been very interested in this camera because of the larger CMO is a smaller camera so when I saw it for sale used I jumped at the chance to buy it.

Bennett", "ReviewID": "R3CCB2PGEHNV6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, I have been a pro photographer since 1974. I have owned Canon SLR cameras dating back to the 35mm film 1N, and forward to the 1Ds Mk II and the 5D Mk II.  I have owned the Canon G11, and now own the G12, which I love very much.  I use the G series cameras while traveling as a tourist.  They are the perfect blend between having the control of a DSLR when you want it, and \"point and shoot\" simplicity when all you want to do is capture the moment while traveling with friends.With all my admiration of the capabilities of the G12, I bought a G1 X for my latest trip to Japan and China.  Right off the bat, I started having problems with ease of use.  I knew when I bought the camera that it was somewhat larger than the G12, but the larger size, with the lens protruding even when retracted, made it too large for anything but the largest coat pocket.  And, then there is the separate lens cap.  The G12 has an integral capping shutter in front of the lens that closes when you turn the camera off, the G1 X has a seperate lens cap that you have to remove.  You then have to constantly worry about loosing it, or attach it to the camera with the provided little string, and stand the chance the string will get in the shot, or the cap will catch on something and yank the camera out of your hands.Also, the G12 is excellent when using the flash in the \"fill flash\" mode when outside in sunlight.  It blends just the right amount of fill into the subject's face in a closeup to eliminate the \"dark eyes\" of overhead sun or backlight.  With the G1 X you have to slide a switch next to the flash on the top of the camera to pop the flash up, if you want to use it.All this is quite a lot to do when you see a cool \"photo op\" developing in front of you.  With the G12, you just needed to push the \"On\" button, and you were instantly ready to shoot.  With the G1 X, you need to remove the lens cap, push the \"On\" button, and then slide the flash switch if you want flash fill.  By then, the candid moment was often gone.Then, there was the focus issues.  A lot of my closeups of people were soft, as in not-in-focus..  Not a little soft, very soft...  Since I was mainly shooting my traveling companions, I was running the camera in the \"Face AiAF\" mode.  I had even \"taught\" the camera what the face of my friends looked like.  At first it was a complete mystery, as the camera was dutifully drawing squares around the faces it was supposedly focusing on, yet many of the head shots were soft.  It took me a week to finally figure out was was going on:  At the wide end of the lens, the minimum focus is reasonable: 40cm or about 1' 4\".  The problem is, the moment you bump the zoom lever to zoom about half way along the zoom range to tighten up, say for a head-shot of someone across the table from you at dinner, the minimum focus jumps out to 1.5m, which is esentially 5 feet!  Many times, I later realized, that person sitting across from me at dinner, or standing in a group, was less than 5 feet away. Even though it did not achieve focus of my subject, the camera would allow me to take the photo, and  only later, upon reviewing the photos, would I realize the subject was soft in the shot.  Really soft.  With the G12, which has much closer minimum focus capability, this was never a problem.  With the G1 X, it was a continuous problem.Critics of my review might say that if I had read the camera specifications carefully, I would have realized these minimum focus limitations.  That is a true statement. But,  I can't believe that Canon designed an expensive compact camera that can't shoot a head shot of a person when they are standing less than 5 feet away.  Yes, I could invoke Macro mode, but that seems stupidly unnecessary when traveling and recording your experiences, and one more step in the already too complex \"make ready\" sequence for this camera.And speaking of Macro mode, because of this minimum focus issue, the Macro mode was hardly \"macro\":  When zoomed fully in, say for a closeup of a flower, the minimum focus in Macro mode was 85cm, 2'9\"... almost 3 feet!!!  Hardly macro.So, I have decided that my G1 X is going up for sale on E Bay, and I am going back to my trusty (and $300 cheaper) G12 as my future travel camera.Sign me disappointed.  Canon, you can do better than this.  Especially for the $300 premium you pay for the G1 X over the price of the G12.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Versatile compact with major flaws", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "RJU90BEZ9D9NT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have used Canon cameras for many years.  I have owned 4 DSLRs and currently use a 5DIII which is state of the art.  My first digital camera was a G1 and I have owned 3 other G series cameras since.  I like the Gs because they are small, self contained and very versatile.  The have almost all of the bells and whistles I like including an articulating screen.  Great for traveling when you don't want to haul a large and heavy DSLR around.  The images are generally very good but not DSLR quality due to the small sensors.I bought a G1 X almost as soon as it became available because it has a much larger sensor, almost the size of an entry level DSLR.  It promised to be a G with DSLR quality.  And the larger sensor does make a visible improvement over earlier Gs.  The lens is also very sharp.  But in the end the camera disappoints.  It has serious flaws that limit its usefulness to a remarkable degree.First, it is sloooow.  The lag in pressing the shutter and taking the shot is so long that the camera basically cannot be used for photographing anything that moves.  Forget kids and pets and sporting events unless you are a long way off.  I recently tried to shoot kids on a trampoline and I would press the shutter when they were in the air with a great expression but the camera would not fire until they were at the bottom of the jump, often looking away or down.  I finally got a couple of good shots by pressing the shutter at the bottom of the jump and hoping it would fire at the top and the kid would have an interesting expression, but it was all hit and miss.  This appears to be a problem with all Canon cameras using a screen focus system.  Canon is really behind other brands in that area.  The auto focus in my 5DIII is equally bad if I use it in live view, which is how the G1 X is functioning all the time.  (In contrast, the 5DIII's normal autofocus through the viewfinder is really fast and accurate.  It may be the best camera made for shooting moving things close up or through a telephoto).Another flaw is a tendency to blow out highlights.  I have never had a camera that blew highlights this badly.  It is so bad I suspect my camera is defective.  The camera mostly cannot be used in direct sunlight.  I am not talking about having the sun in the frame, just shooting outside on a clear day.  Every shot not completely in the shade has unrecoverable overexposed highlights.  I can solve the problem to a degree by underexposing but then the overall shot is too dark and bringing the exposure up in post processing produces a grainy image.  The real problem is very poor dynamic range.  I recently used the camera on a trip to the zoo with my grandson.  I took one picture of him sitting on a sculpture of an elephant.  Both he and the sculpture were in direct sun.  The elephant is perfectly exposed and very detailed but my grandson's face is gone except where it was shaded.  The parts of his face in the direct sun were splotches of pure white and unrecoverable.I have tested this by shooting the same scene with my 5DIII and the G1 X.  The 5DIII has no difficulty shooting in full daylight.  With the 5DIII any part of the scene that shows as overexposed initially is easily recovered.  The G1 X exposes the mid tones and shadows about the same as the 5DIII but almost every light color in the direct sun is lost.  I normally shoot RAW and found the problem even worse with JPEGs in the G1 X.My final gripe is that the G1 X images, though smoother and more detailed than Gs with smaller sensors, are rather flat.  The images have no punch coming out of the camera.  It takes a lot of work to coax out detail and contrast in Photoshop.  Again, my camera may be defective but the difference is immediately obvious when comparing shots with the G1 X to the 5DIII.  Raw shots with the 5DIII are impressive right out of the camera and have a lot of depth to work with.  With the G1 X, a person's face, even if all in the shade and properly exposed, is just a splotch of flesh color as it comes out of the camera.  The larger sensor in the G1 X should do much better than that.So, a great idea but a very poor performer.  Without these flaws it could be a major success.  Hopefully later versions will fix these problems and it will then be a screaming bargain.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera under limited circumstances but don't trade in your older G series camera just yet", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1T0OGAFDBWLQF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really thought the Canon G-1X would be that perfect take everywhere Digital Camera.  It has that G series Solid Build quality, a fully articulating High Resolution LCD, optical viewfinder, HotShoe, Raw shooting, Lots of very accessible manual controls, DSLR sized sensor with built in 4x zoom lens and all in a compact sized package.  I have a Canon G11 which takes terrific photographs at lower ISO settings.  The G11 is limited however at higher ISO settings because of its small sensor.  The G1X has a much larger sensor so I really was expecting G11 quality photographs even at higher ISO settings.Having such high expectations, I was ultimately disappointed.  That is not to say it is a bad camera because it is not.  It just does too many things not well when compared to other cameras in this price range; an entry level DSLR or Compact System Camera and even the G11.First, the Really good:  The build quality, the controls, camera design, very sharp & 4x lens captures every detail even at higher ISO settings (much better than many kit lenses); perfect match for the 270EX speedlight, great color reproduction/auto white balance in artificial (indoor) lighting, almost every setting can be manually adjusted and customized, Excellent High ISO shooting, Very Sharp, bright and fully articulating LCD, usable optical viewfinder, compact sized and reasonably lightweightNext, the Not so Good: Anything taken closer than a foot away (all macro shooting) is just a blur, photos taken in natural lighting (sunshine) look drab and washed out when compared to any decent Compact system or DSLR camera or even a good point and shoot like Canon's other G series offerings (even after performing every in-camera adjustment available); Automatic White Balance and Evaluative metering for natural lighting (sunshine) is not reliable; AutoFocus and shooting performance more like a point & shoot camera rather than a camera in this price range.In sun lit conditions (low ISO settings), the photographs rendered by the G11 (and presumably the G12 & G15) are much more vibrant and clearly better overall with much better dynamic range and shadow detail.  Under artificial lighting and using an external bounce flash, both the G11 and G1X rendered similar (and very good) photographs up to ISO 400.  After ISO 400 (indoors), the photographs rendered by the G1X were markedly superior to the G11 and comparable to an entry level DSLR or compact system camera.  Macro shooting was not even close, the G11 (and almost every other camera I have ever used) was much, much better than the G1X.This camera has a target audience; someone who shoots primarily at higher ISO settings that is looking for a very portable, solidly built camera with an optical viewfinder, great LCD with manual and RAW shooting capabilities that does not care about macro capabilities.  However if you do most of your picture taking outdoors, I can not see any reason to purchase this camera.If purchasing this camera, I definitely recommend choosing a vendor with liberal return privileges (ie Amazon). I can definitely see some people falling in love with this camera and yet others requesting an RMA within a short time.  I also definitely recommend the 270EX speedlight for this camera (to be used in bounce mode).  It is a real difference maker.  I did not use the video so obviously I can not comment on that.  However the bright and fully articulating LCD screen would appear to be very convenient for video shooting.Addendum July 8th:  I noted in the review that some people will love this camera.  Based upon the tone of the comments, that appears to be accurate.Addendum: The Canon EOS-M equipped with the 22mm lens is smaller, lighter, cheaper and takes much better photos in all lighting conditions.  Similarly, The Canon SL1/100D is a much better option than the G-1X.  The SL1 is similarly priced and weighs only two ounces more when equipped with the kit (STM) lens.

I found the shutter lag to be EXTREMELY annoying.  Taking the camera out of the box, it has a great, solid feel.  When you take pictures of still objects, the clarity is fabulous, and the zoom is the best I've seen.  But with the shutter lag, it seems to limit what you can do with the camera -- great for stills, not so great for any kind of live action.  When I took the camera to the zoo, I could rarely catch the pic when the animals are looking right at you; and even their movements (pretty slow, not like a sporting event) came out blurry.  I tried this in bright daylight, shutter priority, and several other settings.  My brother, who has a Canon 60D, also tried it and had the same feedback.

My comments are regarding the terrible audio quality outdoors when shooting video.  Yes, there a \"electronic wind screen\" ... it's worthless.  If there is even a slight breeze when shooting outdoors you get 25% wind noise.  If it's windy it tends to drownout any other audio making the audio track worthless.  I recently shot video of the V&T; railroads steam engine in Carson City and there was a breeze.  The audio was so distorted from wind noise I had to dump it and use canned sound effects.  Shame on Canon for sending out a video camera without the ability to add an external microphone with a wind screen.  Don't ever shoot video outdoors in a wind or even a light breeze, then this is the best compact there is.Item #2:  Lens cap.  Why on earth did the makers not use the lens cover as used on the Canon G-11 & 12?  Already on Amazon is the \"JCC ALC-G1X Professional Auto lens Cap\"  ($14.99 & free shipping) that opens and closes automatically\".  This neat add-on is user installed in less than 5 seconds and automatically opens and closes to protect the lens.Update:  January 2013 - I've been using the unit for 6 months now and it's both durable and a pleasure to use.

So, I kept asking around and a camera store worker recommended the G1X.It seemed like it had everything I wanted. I ordered it, received it, then left on a trip. One of the things I like doing the most is shooting close-ups of things... With the G-12, I figured out that I had to shoot wide angle and get really close to focus on things, and it worked... And like I said, I loved it...Now I have the G1X... It has turned out to be sub-standard... I'm on my trip now and tried to use the macro function/setting... Nothing.. Whether wide angle, telephoto, or in between, the camera will not focus on things close-up... And needless to say, I'm PISSED! $600+ for a camera that doesn't have a functional macro setting! WTF?!? That just cut out about 75% of what I shoot with a camera like this.I'm soooo PISSED OFF right now. If I had found out about this flaw before buying, I would have used the money I spent on the G1X and put it towards a new lens for my bigger Nikon DSLR camera.Can't believe Canon took the time to make a small \"supposedly great\" little camera and then left out something as basic as a functional Macro setting!Canon...

It shoots slow, I have a big chip in it but it still lags when you press the shutter, very annoying.

After shooting about 74 photos and videos and reviewing the results on my computer I immediately decided the GX1 is not worth the expense and sent it back. Most of the photos were soft and not sharp at all, and the color was not vivid. Some photos had a reddish tint to them. (Maybe I got a bad unit). The G12 does a better job on photos. The GX1 has better video quality than the G12, but that does not make it worth shelling out close to $800. If you are looking for a Canon camera close to the GX1 size, get the G12.

I believe some of those writers at the review sites haven't even seen one.  The G1X is supposedly geared to the more professional market as a backup and more portable and discreet camera with high quality images. With this in mind the operation will of course take some getting used to. I am a photojournalist working in some extreme conditions and this would theoretically be a great fit as I always have to have a camera with me.Upon opening the box, to my surprise and disappointment I found that this $800 camera does not come with an owners manual and we all have to occasionally refer to the manual.  It comes with a CD to down load it so while you are dealing with extreme conditions with your new G1X in your BDU side pocket  or trying to be discreet you will have to carry your laptop with you for any questions and there are defiantly some. Trust me, just viewing you photos is a challenge in itself. Come on Canon not even an app.I am shooting in Raw which is why I bought this camera.  It seems that many of the reviewers have obviously not taken any photos and tried to open them in PhotoShop (CS4) because it can't be done. So much for targeting the pro market. The only way to open them is to use Canon's Digital Photo Professional software.  Here is the trick, You either have to download and install all the crap on their CD to get a usable version of DPP (there is no custom installation) or in my case I went to Canon Service and Support site and downloaded an upgrade to the DPP version I already had and was using flawlessly with the Raw images form my 7D. The 7D Raw images open in Bridge and Photo Shop with no problem. You can open the G1X Raw images now with the upgrades DPP and do some very basic editing then using the batch processing, save them in tiff (80mb) to a file and then open them in bridge and Photo Shop to work on them which is a real pain but can be done.  If you plan to travel with the G1X , don't plan on using just any coffee house computer etc.The main reason that I will be returning this thing, is that my wife loves to accompany me on location and while she can handle any situation that comes our way, she is not a photographer, but will shoot some great grab shots that I may miss as long as the camera is set to Auto (green) and I can cleanup or crop later as long as the info is there. So another important reason that I wanted this Camera is that I can hand it to my wife and off we go.  Not exactly, the G1X will not shoot in Raw while set to auto or any scene modes.This camera is a total disappointment for the niche I hoped to fill . Nice design too.
