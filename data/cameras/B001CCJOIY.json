The camera is dense, feels hefty for its size when picked up, unlike many similar cameras that feel like a piece of plastic. This is a fine example of Japanese craftsmanship. It is fast and very responsive in operation. The lens is fantastic, 25mm (effective) wide angle is rare among such cameras, significantly wider angle than the 28mm of the FX33. In wide angle lenses every mm counts. Thankfully, the max aperture is back to f/2.8 - the FX35 maxed at f/3.3. The lens is sharp edge to edge with very little, if any, in the way of distortion and chromatic aberration. Certainly, the lens is better than the sensor. The wide aperture (f/2.8) at the wide angle is great for low light [The lenses on the FX35, TZ3, TZ4 and TZ5 are not as fast].The flash is weak [manufacturers under-power the flash in order to gain on the \"shots per battery charge\" scale.].Hints: In low light, including indoor shots with flash, use the wide angle (zoom out) to make use of the f/2.8 aperture, and you'll get fewer dark underexposed pictures. Stick with ISO 100 and 200. Keep ISO 400 for emergencies, but never go beyond 400. In auto-ISO mode, you can limit the max ISO. You probably read a lot about image noise. Yes, it is there, but you will not see it in 4x6 or 8x10 prints. You won't see it on a typical 20\" monitor (12\"x16\") when viewing the whole image on the screen. You will see it if you view part of the image 1:1, which amounts to close up inspection of a 57\"x38\" print (assuming the monitor is running at 1024x768). Those wanting 57\"x38\" prints will be using a medium-format digital back, not this camera anyway. Reduce the resolution to 3 or 5 mp and you'll see less noise (per pixel), and save hard disk space!I recommend an extra battery and a 4 GB memory card (minimum).Optical image stabilization is very effective indeed. Video (1280x720x30) is very good.I took out one star for: 1) Lack of full manual controls, 2) sensor noise.This camera needs a larger sensor.The more expensive TZ3, TZ4 and TZ5 lack the f/2.8 aperture (they max at f/3.3).If you like the size and build-quality of the FX37, but want a better picture-taking machine, look at the LX3. It has a larger sensor, manual controls, RAW, and an excellent 24-60mm (equiv) f/2-2.8 lens. The LX3 is destined to be a big hit.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "First Impressions very positive", "Author": "D.

They have ceased the race for megapixel king and I was hoping image quality and not megapixels would become important.Camera is 10MP, and has a 5x wide angle zoom.  Plenty of MP for most uses and users.The 5X zoom, while not the smoothest when zooming, the range is really appreciated. From a wide to a nice short tele! Very useful.  On of my favorite things to do on vacation is to make \"two-fers\" self portraits of my wife and I. Not easy to do with most point and shoots, not wide enough to capture people and ambiance.  This one fits the bill nicely!First impressions:  Camera is smaller than I had expected. This is a plus. It is the same size dimensionally as the Sony Cybershot T-5 it replaces.Also a plus.  It is lighter than the Sony, and does not have that \"solid\" feeling. I consider this a neutral or slight minus.Fast on the Draw, acceptable shutter lag from this class of camera (I use a D2X as well).  Facial recognition focus seems to work too.One of the most easy to navigate and use menus I have come across. It is distilled to a bare minimum.Wish it captured RAW data.I had been concerned, and started to have buyers remorse before I received the camera when I read some reviews of the predecessor about noise in poorly illuminated settings. This does not seem to be a problem. My abbreviated testing in low light has very acceptable results.

I did a ton of research, and was interested in the similar Canon and Sony offerings, but I couldn't be happier with the Fx37. I love the wide angle which is great for taking self portraits and such things when traveling alone, but also works great for interior shots.Not only does it take incredible pictures with the leica optics, I actually become must more into shooting video on it as it shoots native 720p video.

Second - the wide angle of 24\u00a4 is great. It is easy to get photoes in a room and get most of the room in the picture. Third - the 5x optical zoom is large enough for most pictures you will need, special handheld with the anti-shake. The anti-shake is a great help to get clear pictures. There are many more things this camera can do - and it is so easy to handle. So, all in all, this p&s; is quite a little camera and best of all - it takes GREAT pictures!

The camera had to have at least 5x zoom, my biggest requirement until I started reading and hearing about the advantages of a wide-angle lens. Finding the two together in the camera size I wanted was not easy (at least in the two brands above and in a reasonable price range for me) and I wavered between less zoom but wide-angle, or no wide-angle and 5x (or more) zoom. Finally I decided on the Panasonic DMC-FX37 which offers both and is very small! I am very happy with it so far! I think the photos and videos are super and the extra features are amazing. I don't like the exposure screen that pops up every once in awhile when I'm ready to take a shot (it's great to know that if I adjust right then the picture will come out better) but I have lost the photo opportunity a few times since I haven't figured out how to override the screen quickly. The manual is a bit overwhelming but I'm sure help is available in those pages somewhere!Four stars as I've compared my photos with a similar Canon camera and I think those are a bit better; however, I love having the 5x zoom and wide-angle which I would never do without again.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "A photographer", "ReviewID": "RD3N1PKDCBP89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fine little pocket camera.  It has a feeling of being well-built and solid. It is tiny in size so it's convenient to slip into a pocket for easy transport.  It has enough features to satisfy the casual to more advanced user.  While it has been criticized for the amount of noise it produces, this is pretty common for small sensor digicams.  There are ways to minimize the noise but the best thing to do is just simply accept it and enjoy the convenience.  I do miss having the option of shooting in RAW but, really, JPEGs are fine for most uses--especially at the best resolution quality settings.The Leica-badged lens gets a lot of praise but it's not as great as some have said--at least on my sample.  Although it's a little soft in the corners at the widest focal length, I do appreciate the option of having the equivalent of a 25mm equivalent lens on pocket camera.  That wide focal length was the main selling point for me.  No, this Leica lens does not have the same optical properties and qualities of the ledgendary Leica lenses used on the venerable 35mm rangefinders.  It's a \"Leica\" in name only.  I'm sure the name brand was licensed from Leica with little input on the part of the optical design.  Still, its quite good despite a little softness at the wide setting.The photos from this camera do not compare in absolute image quality to those from either a full-frame or APS-C format DSLR.  Nor do they look as good as those from my compact Canon G10.  But the DSLR is overkill for most subjects I shoot and the G10 is at the upper limits in size for a \"compact\" camera.  The Panasonic is a true pocket camera.  You accept the shortcomings in order to get the versatility and convenience.(This model camera has been discontinued it appears.  This is a common thing these days--as soon as a digital camera finds its place in the market, it is updated.  That makes it hard for a product to establish a solid track record and gain a reputation.  But most updating is simple tweaking of the basic design.  The FX37 was simply an updating of the FX35.

I love photography and  wanted the best possible quality shots without getting into the size, bulk & general baggage of a DSLR (too bulky, we're talking traveling light here). I thought I'd have to compromise, and did a lot of researching (like others I considered the Canon Cybershot , Nikon, Elph & other products). Wide angle (think European plazas) and low light (European plazas at night) as well as zoom (4x bare minimum) and VIDEO--I'll never carry another separate camcorder again.Settled on the FX37 and I've been totally satisfied. It exceeds all my previous expectation. And with little or no compromise over my fullsize DSLR. As others have noted, the build quality feels solid, not plastic-y, manual controls are well designed and unambiguous, menus provide almost excessively  ample choices and AI features while being straightforward and undistractingly easy to navigate--way to go, Panasonic. The lens versatility is very good, and the 5x zoom is fine. I get about 250-300 shots from each battery charge, about as advertised, and the camera has survived several small minor drops without damage. It's been a great choice. The FX37 seems to have been discontinued (?) but I prefer it over those 2009 models that replaced it which I've seen so far--the 37 has better build quality and the 25mm lens is a winner. Just a great camera, and especially at the price. No real complaints or I-wish-it-had's...I find the flash is bright enough for most indoor uses (it's not designed to be an outdoor flood) and, again, I'm extremely satisfied with the camera overall. One tip: do buy one or more additional spare batteries, the Panasonic name brand only, avoid generic knockoffs, elsewhere here on Amazon for $12-18. A second charger at $15 or so is another worthwhile accessory, especially if you're traveling & don't want to wait up late to recharge 2 or more batteries one at a time...with the second charger you can recharge both at once & you're good to go again.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "M.

My son would often review the photos for what I thought was a long time relative to using a camera for just taking photos and the battery life did go down a bit, but the camera was still usable before the day ended.  Flash is just what it is for a compact camera.  Nothing special.  I don't like the image stabilization for video.  When I pan across the scene in video mode, there are times the image will jump but mostly it will be smooth - it is a bit irritating to see it so smooth with a few sharp jumps.  If it is windy at all, forget the audio.  It handles a 16GB SDHC card very well, but video is still limited to 8 minute clips which is really not an issue - it just confused me at fist when I inserted the 16 GB card - I was expecting longer video time, but that is how it is designed as I learned from reading the manual.  There are a lot of different scene modes.  Maybe too many.  It will take time to know which ones to use for what purpose.  I used the beach scene for a portrait that had a very bright background, otherwise if I used the iA mode (intelligent mode), it didn't flash and the subject was dark with a bright background - the beach scene forced the flash and it was a better photo.

It was discontinued then, it is still discontinued today. Having said that, it was one of the best cameras out there *for its size*. It is still a great camera today - my wife loves it. The large aperture (f2.8 at the widest angle) improves the performance in low light. The wide angle lens (25 mm equivalent) allows taking pictures with everybody in frame, even in tight spaces (when you can't step back to compose). As a downside, the zoom is not available while shooting video. You are stuck with the focal length you chose before hitting the rec button. Bummer.Simply put, back in 2009 one could not buy a better camera of a similar size. If you want better image quality, manual control, and do not mind about size (bigger) and cost (higher) - go for a larger sensor camera such as Lumix LX-3 or (better) LX-5, Olympus XZ1 or Canon S95. None of these will fit in your pocket or a tiny purse, though. If you want better (and even bigger) than these, go for a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera such as Lumix GF-1/2, Sony NEX-3/5 or Olympus E-Pen series. Just for the record, I own at least one camera in each of the above categories (along with full frame DSLR's) and still love the tiny FX37. My wife would not even consider grabbing any of the bigger ones when going out (she does not find them practical).As of today (May 2011), I would probably buy a more current model like Lumix FX78, which has an even slightly larger maximum aperture (f2.5, vs. f2.8 in FX37), a slightly wider lens (24 mm vs. 25 mm in FX37) and a slightly higher resolution (12 MP vs. 10 in FX37) - not that any of these would make a big difference in the actual photos. Video specs in FX78 are *much* better though - Full HD (1080 lines, vs. 720 in FX37) and you can zoom in and out while shooting (as it should).One thing you might hate in FX78 (I do) is the lack of mechanical controls - most buttons have been replaced with touch screen controls. It looks cool, but it takes longer to operate the camera (i.e. take pictures) and it makes it really hard outdoors, in bright light (the place where the point-and-shoot cameras should work at their best...).Bottom line: if you buy an FX37 in 2011 for the price of an FX78, make sure you know why.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC FX37S Camera", "Author": "B.

After using the 37 for a week, I have since returned it. Almost every picture looks like it was taken with a webcam--very pixelated and grainy at 10MP shooting 4:3. Also, the LCD screen is very low-quality. Lastly, there is a lot of shutter lag. It's too bad since it boasts such a wide lens (although this does cause more-than-moderate fish-eye effect with images close up) and the HD 16:9 video (although, I don't really need that anyway). This is the first time in awhile that I have purchased a non-Canon camera and I will not do so again. Oh, and as with other Panasonic Lumix cameras, the usb input is non-standard (usually a mini-usb).
