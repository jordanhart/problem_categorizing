I am deployed to afghanistan with the Army and their are some really beautifull animals out here.  This camera is able to hold a tight, high deffinition quality picture even when fully zoomed in on a moving target.  The amount of options that are available to customize make it easy to adjust your style of photography.  This camera is worth more than I paid for it and I would glady purchase it again. All and all its a fantastic camera for a great price.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Alternative to a Digital SLR", "Author": "E. Peak \"JaWa\"", "ReviewID": "R3GTA07FB1F5NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted several features that are not typically available in point and shoot cameras, i.e. enhanced zoom (this one goes to 18X), burst shooting capabilities, high definition video  capabilities coupled with high quality pictures. This camera offers all these features and several others that I probably will find useful without the high learning curve and bulk of a Digital SLR. The controls are placed where they will be handy without going through a menu everytime one wants to change modes and settings.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera at a great price!", "Author": "C. McCombs \"kriska1976\"", "ReviewID": "R3KQWX6OAZDBCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on a whim to get it right before our recent beach vacation.  I got it the day before we left and really had no time at all to play with it, but it didn't matter!  I used it on auto most of the time and have the most amazing photos from our trip.  The zoom is fantastic!  The pictures turn out crystal clear even at the full 18x zoom.  It is really light weight which I really love as well.  I haven't had great luck with traditional point and shoot cameras, even with the last nikon being at 12 mp, it still didn't turn out the way I wanted them to.  I really wanted to invest in a dslr, but it is a huge investment and they are very heavy to lug around.  This camera is the best of both worlds, ease and light weight and photos of a dslr.  I am so glad I decided to purchase this camera.  I do not regret it one bit!", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Enjoy my camera", "Author": "sharon", "ReviewID": "R2Z25L9WXUJ39J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have really been enjoying my camera a lot. Im still learning how to use all of the features,but it came with instructions that are easy to understand. up until now I was using a small point and shoot camera, and I wanted something with a wider zoom. This camera works well, and takes great pictures. I spent two days reading reviews, before I chose this camera, and decided this was the best one in my price range, and I have'nt been disappointed.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Much good -- and missing three key points, for me", "Author": "Lawrence Gold \"somatic educator\"", "ReviewID": "R1I98PFPZ0LAAN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use a camera for video as much as for still images.Much good:  image quality, color, digital viewfinder, LCD monitor, organization of menus/featuresMissed the mark:poor audio quality (microphone/ambient noise) when recording video (unusable -- requires external recording source)video resolution: 640 x 480 (I had hoped for higher definition)video limit = 2GB/clip, even with a 16GB memory chipI ended up locating a used replacement for my faulty Fujifilm E550, which also has 640 x 480 and quite decent video/sound quality.The E550 is not available, new, anymore.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great zoom, great photos", "Author": "Jennifer R. Meyer", "ReviewID": "R2KUJNXTXH6Z4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm an artist, so I find myself taking a lot of pictures of my work- some of which are very small indeed. This camera is perfect for me! Not only does it have the standard macro mode for small objects, it also has a super macro mode for REALLY tiny objects. I feel like I'm holding a microscope!The zoom is also incredible. I've been able to capture every hair on a chipmunk from twelve feet away. Of course, the more you zoom in the more you risk blurriness from a wobbly camera...but it's still pretty amazing to see just how well the auto-stabilize feature works. It doesn't come through every time, but certainly more often than I expected.This camera also offers several approaches for photography, depending on your skill level. Honestly, the Auto feature works really well- it, of course, automatically adjusts the camera settings to current light conditions. I've taken indoor photos that look just fine. If you're feeling a little more adventurous, you can go with scene selection instead. You choose a camera setting from a list of scenarios- indoor party, flower, snow, night time, fireworks, etc. Or, if you're an advanced user, you can forgo the auto and preset options and adjust the aperture and shutter settings yourself. In short: a great camera with options for every skill level.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "MAL \"MAL\"", "ReviewID": "R16ZMIRVRIU3UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a high school yearbook teacher on a shoestring budget, I am always on the lookout for good, affordable cameras.  This one is excellent.  It is inexpensive and takes excellent photos.  The zoom is excellent, even without a tripod, if you hold the camera steady, the 18X zoom works wonderfully.  Once good action settings are programmed in, the students can take excellent action shots.  The only complaint I have about the camera is that it takes longer than I would like for the photo to be stored, especially in the burst modes.  However, for the price, it is excellent.  We liked it so much that we purchased another.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujian 2550 HD", "Author": "D.

I changed my Sony CyberShoot for this one (more expensive) and the quality of the images is really poor.
