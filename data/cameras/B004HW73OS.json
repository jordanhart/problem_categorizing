It turns on and is ready to shoot in about a second. And if you change the default image size from the huge 16 megapixel to something more commonly used in the real world (and you have a fairly fast SD card), you can be ready for the next picture in less then a second.It's sad to see so many people fail to understand this, and I'd say shame on Canon for not making this clear in their \"start up\" documentation. Even the CNET review pointed out it was slow writing a 16 meg file to the card (as would be expected), and my belief is CNET said that to chide Canon for not making it clear the setting should be changed to \"what's appropriate for your picture needs\".Most people are not making Poster Sized Prints! And because of that, creating 16 megapixel images is a total waste of hard drive (and flash SD card) space, not to mention the time one has to wait for it to write it to the flash card (as so many have complained about).Please take the time to do a Google search and read some of the freely available information on this subject. A 16 megapixel image is no more clearer then a 4 megapixel image on your 22\" monitor.I hope that's enough information to get people started to better understand this \"megapixel\" thing. The camera has the ability to write out a 16 megapixel image (yes that will be slow)... but the vast vast vast majority of us do not need this feature, it's overkill to the max... It's all the other features this camera has that make it a great choice!", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "WARNING: Image Distortion Occurs with this Model (and no one is talking about it)!!", "Author": "Kimmylikins", "ReviewID": "R17HL0FEFO513O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As an owner of multiple Canon camera's in my lifetime, including my current 7.1 mp \"Powershot SD750 Elf\" and 16 mp \"Rebel T2i\" DSLR, I really put confidence in Canon's products. Or, I did. Now I am just frustrated and at a loss for where to go from here.First you should know that while I am not a professional photographer, I am far from a beginner and am pretty adept with technology. I purchased the \"Canon Powershot A3300 IS\" as a replacement for my now outdated and thoroughly used 7.1 mp Elf. I was beyond excited when it arrived and beyond disappointed after using it. Half of my images came out with a barrel-type distortion at the upper edge. This occurred mainly in close-up images that filled the frame, but also in a shot that was composed at about a 6 or 7 ft distance of three children. The two children squatting down were perfectly centered and look beautiful; but the child standing behind them who was just above the center of the frame, ended up with an elongated lump head.  The close-up images would cause the heads and faces of the people in the picture to be elongated and at times even skewed. They basically end up looking like individuals afflicted with certain types of dwarfism, where there is an exaggerated forehead; or, in some of the images, the subjects looked like they were in a fun-house mirror with weird elongated and skewed faces and heads. The distortion was more subtle in some shots and more obvious in others; but I know my own family, and it was fairly easy to look at the image then look across the room and see that something was clearly wrong with the picture.  I did not notice the distortion with scenery shots or photos of my cat quite as easily, but it *was* there in some images if I looked VERY hard.I scoured the Internet for anyone who might have experienced the same issue, as none of the Amazon reviews mentioned it from what I saw. I could not find any answers. I called Canon technical support and found myself talking to a man who cut me off numerous times, asked me questions that I had already explained the answer to and generally seemed aggravated to be working at the moment. (NOTE: This is the exact opposite of a very pleasant technical support conversation that I had with an extremely helpful gentleman about 4 years ago in regard to my then new Elf.)  The tech support rep told me that he had never heard of this problem; he thought it may just be a bad egg in the bunch. I followed his advice and returned it to Amazon for an exchange.  Unfortunately, the second A3300 IS had the same exact problem. I packed it right back up and shipped it back for a full refund.I rated the Canon Powershot A3300 IS at a mere two (2) stars because despite all of the options, the bells and whistles, not to mention the aesthetically pleasing color options, the A3300 IS was a complete disappointment. What good is a camera with great image quality - even if it was a point-and-shoot that some how was able to rival a DSLR - if the images are distorted??  I am certainly not framing or sharing images of my child or my family if everyone looks like they are the Conehead's long lost cousins the Bigheads.  :o(After all of the back and forth with Canon and Amazon, I discovered that CNET's review found the same exact issue as I had with the A3300 IS. (I have no idea how I missed this when I did my initial research, but I have pasted the info below as a reference.) So, despite what Canon's tech support rep was trying to sell me: This *IS* an issue with the A3300 IS model and I *DO* know what I am talking about. Where do I go from here? I really don't know. The A3300 IS was the most appealing Canon replacement for my good old Elf; but with the A3300 IS removed from the game, I am considering a Nikon COOLPIX or maybe even a SONY Cyber-shot. Unfortunately, my heart just isn't in it anymore. Hopefully Canon will rectify this blunder and offer a comparable model, less the fun-house effects, sometime in the near future.FROM THE CNET WEB SITE:\"There is slight barrel distortion at the wide end of the A3300's lens and maybe a little with the lens in telephoto, too. Center sharpness is good, but there is softening at the top, bottom, and sides and, at least on my review camera, the bottom corners were visibly smeary.\"READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT:[...]", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A3300 IS", "Author": "krycom", "ReviewID": "R1ATCGXCFR4XW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot A3300 IS is small enough and nicely fits into your pocket.

My last camera used film, this is my first digital and first compact camera.  I love it. It is foolproof and perfect size.  I bought the [[ASIN:B004HW73O8 Canon Powershot A3300 IS 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom (Red].  I get confused if electronics/cameras have lots of gizmos, dials and settings, but this camera's functions and settings are explained clearly on the screen when selected.  There is an Easy Setting so you don't really have to think or know what light setting and all that and your pictures will turn out great.  It does everything you could possibly think of or at least what I wanted, at an excellent price.  It takes great pictures and video and comes with a battery, charger and cables and has internal memory as well.  It catalogues and dates your pictures and can create slide shows.  Today, I learned - fooling around - that I can change the pictures I take right in the camera.  Say, for instance, I felt my arm looked too big or flabby in a photo that was otherwise perfect, with my husband, (not that this was me of course) I can crop it and edit out part of my arm and walla, the perfect couple picture.  My hands shake when I hold a camera, very subtly, but this corrects for it with image stabilization.  I just love this little camera and am so glad I moved to a digital compact.  My goodness, the options are unreal!!!  Red eye correction - can I tell you how many pictures I've seen ruined, otherwise good pictures, due to this.  At the price I paid, I feel I got a great deal.

Amazon still had pre order on it. Today March 8th 2011 PCNation had it in stock replacing Amazon's link. So I purchased it because it said they were in stock. Well when I got the invoice it said BACKORDERED. PCNation is misleading and they haven't had them in stock at all. I called them directly and the CS rep said they were supposed to come in on Feb 28th. So again they never had them in stock. I cancelled my order and wanted to post on here letting anyone know not to order from them.update, they are in stock now. 3/14/11Tested:So I got the camera.. finally, but i'm a little disappointed in the picture quality. I did side by side tests with my trusted Powershot SD 950 and my results were 50/50. 95% of the pics taken on the A3300 like landscapes, trees, wooded areas, almost everything set in the widest zoom out had sharpness issues using the auto and smart settings. P and live were only slightly better. (P & Live let you set contrast, sat, bright, sharpness etc. The centers of the camera were fairly sharp but all four corners were clearly not in focus. Compared to my 950 there was clearly a sharpness issue. There's also a saturation issue and feel that the auto features knock it down a little too much and pics can look muddy. I attached photos to show comparison.Then I tested out the macro feature and did side by side tests with both cameras again and these seemed to be closer in comparison. The 950 had less noise and more bokeh though.Build quality is ok on the A3300, the battery door is also the location for the memory card which felt a little cheap so I'd be careful. The shutter button is a little too far centered and i kept wanting to press the setting dial which is on the edge of the camera. The zoom in/out slider is located with the shutter button and its a bit difficult to manage as well as feeling very breakable and loose. The 3\" LCD is very nice but compared to my 950 you can see small pixel dots on the A3300. Startup/zoom in/out seems as fast as the 950. Photo taking is slightly faster with the A3300 as well as focusing and another thing I noticed is that the subject focus lock (green square on lcd) found the subject I wanted in focus faster and more accurately then my trusted 950.After taking a pic, the time to save to my memory card was still just as slow as the 950, i'm using a class 6 memory card and should see faster saves with the A3300 but don't. The size of the camera is nice, its a little lighter than the 950 and thinner but the same length but that fine. I do like the wider angle as well as the 5x optical zoom. I'll be doing more tests on this camera in the coming weeks and will post more info.If your looking for a new camera that has many features, large lcd, comes in colors and is fairly compact, this may be a good choice but remember that photo quality/sharpness isn't the best but most won't notice.UPDATED March 28, 2011well, sadly after testing and comparing a bit more, i've decided to return this camera because the sharpness just isn't there. I decided to purchase and test the Panasonic DMC-FH25 Panasonic DMC-FH25A 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Blue) and i'm glad I did. Its a little more money but well worth it. The size of the camera is about the same as is the weight. Its also Blue and is 16mp too. The screen is 2.7 and not 3 but no big deal. The camera is much faster all around including taking the photos and most of all saving is very quick. The focusing is just as fast as the canon although there were a few times there pressing the button half way didn't do anything, not sure why, Look for my full review on the camera.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product and price", "Author": "Hal R.

Granted it was some years earlier since my last camera purchase, so maybe it's an industry standard by now. However, if you are as unaware of this new standard as I was or perhaps it is not a new standard after all, then let me fill you in. I took pictures all day long and the battery just lasted and lasted. I took hundreds of pictures and some videos, in total several minutes in clips and it still wasn't until the next morning when I had to pop in a new battery and put the original in the charger. I had ordered 2 replacement batteries because I was anticipating the need to change them often. However, one could easily recharge in the evening and be set to go with the same batt the following day. I would suggest one replacement is well enough, (unless you take zillions of videos). I never yet had to swap to the third replacement and only once did I have to swap to the second after the batt charged all night because I took at least a couple hours worth of videos. Now I rotate through all 3 of them and they all seem to last as long as the day of their first use.Now enough of batt life.The images the camera takes are bright, clear, you can set it to auto and have a perfect picture every shot or you can choose to do your own settings.Some of my favorite settings are the miniature and macro. There are many options and then options on top of those. There is too many to explain all and on top of that I still have yet to experiment with all the possibilities, which is surprising considering I had it for over six months now.I will say in auto it takes *Great shots all around* Night* Day* Close-Ups* Far away* Even flyby shots In the car*Even at times when I rushed to get a flyby picture I was surprised the camera at least 50% of the time captured a great image even though my jolting hands were likely giving the thing havoc. Mind you, it is best to expect to hold the camera steady, aim and take your pic, in that manner the camera will never fail to produce a wonderful picture.I will point out the only two downsides & one minor nuances that I can think of, while they didn't matter to me, they still may be issues important, or not, to you and thus it will help you decide to get or skip over this camera for yourself.When taking a video with a very bright light (like the actual orb of the sun) it tends to bleed right across the video in a thin streak. *Note this is not a concern for pictures, ONLY videos* I do not often have such a bright light in my video, so this was not a major concern to me. If you like to take videos of the sun, fires, candles or other bright lights you will be irritated by this.There are a few options to take night/dark area photos, one of these is the low-light option and it does not produce the sharpest image. But if you do not mind softer edges it will capture shots in what appears to be exact duplicate lighting of real life.This was not important to me, because I tend to like to use the flash in low light areas anyway and the pictures I tend to want without flash are of lights, which the camera does not need the low light to capture.Now the minor nuances is I had to adjust myself to the camera to enable proper focus by giving a little pressure to the shutter button a second or half a second before taking a photo. It was slightly off putting at first, but now it is second nature.The value of this camera for cost feels like a steal. I feel like I have a 300-400 dollar camera. As for the battery life, well it seems like the camera ends up paying for itself with the amount I have saved in comparison to the battery consumption of my past cameras.Very happy with this camera.*I want to Add; I read everywhere about this camera before buying, watched reviews on youtube, elsewhere and everything said was great (save for those picking on tiny things when comparing to much more expensive cameras). However, when it came down to it I almost was not going to buy this camera because of the Ridiculous claim of distortion by the other reviewer here on Amazon!!! To think what I would have lost out on! That review that actually in FACT DID NOT HELP the 199 people that said it helped cause they lost out on a great camera! We can assume the kindest thing and say that reviewer must have left the camera in the \"Fish-eye\" option, which is a playful option to make funny photos. (Honestly I think the whole review is someones idea of a horrible joke or a competitors idea of throwing people off the scent of a great buy, cause the fish-eye thing is pretty obvious to discover!) I found ZERO distortion in ALL the photos I took with this camera, other then the intended ones, as the fisheye does a funny barrel look, the miniature option fogs the bottom and top to make things look tiny, as edges are blackened to create a viewmaster sort of effect with the toy-camera option. As I mentioned above there are too many options and options to list.

I prefer it set up in widescreen mode (W) which is meant for widescreen television use but is a perfect fit for digital photo frame (shown in video).The biggest difficulty is getting accustomed to the wide-angle lens. Perfect for outdoor landscapes and city scapes, more general use means careful use of the zoom function. Indoor shots are excellent thanks to the range of shutter speeds and the flash. The Macro setting had me staring at the hairs on the trunk of a Rosemary plant on my kitchen shelf! Very impressive.Its first use was for an ID photo I needed. I used the self-timer and being someone who wears glasses was appreciative of the non-flash picture. Colour was tweaked in my Adobe Elements photo software.I would suggest that this is no camera for beginners. The range of options still has me dipping into that 200 page manual. Whilst the Easy switch enables kids to use the camera this has a 16 mega pixel default setting for an A2 size photo. In other words: TREAD CAREFULLY!The image stabiliser for movie makers feels like the camera is on a tripod. A quality memory card like the one shown in video is a must for making movies. It was a film that immediately sprung to mind when I first switched on the camera after charging the battery. The film Blade Runner: The Final Cut inspired my video and seems to get better each time I view Ridley Scott's dystopian nightmare world of darkness and rain: \"If you're not cop - you're little people\" says the fat controller of Harrison Ford's former occupation.The camera case is EXPro Hardcase, camera case for Canon Powershot A3300 IS,.

If you are used to digital, then this is a great choice.  Great video, which I suggest if you are taking pics of small children, or moving objects.  If, however, you learned to shoot on a 35mm, you will have a learning curve with this camera, as there is a 3-5 second lag time between when you press the button, and when the actual shutter functions.  Thinking your picture has been taken, you then move the camera, and the picture is blurred.  Also, when the subject is moving, your pics will be blurred, regardless of megapixels.

The camera is so small it's easy to cover something like the microphone or flash when you don't want to.  Start up and pic to pic times are fair.  The 16 MP resolution can be adjusted to 8 or 2 or VGA (I would have preferred 4 MP).  Pic/video quality is OK for me although some will object.

We liked that camera and were sure that we couldn't go wrong with another of the same brand. Although the few pictures we took with this model looked fine, we will be returning the camera simply because it is just too slow. The shutter lag after you press the button is about two seconds, which is a really long time if you're trying to catch a candid shot. The camera also requires several seconds after it actually captures the shot before it's ready for another. This is, of course, a problem with all digital cameras to some degree, but this (newer) camera is noticeably slower than our old Elph. It's not a bad camera in terms of image quality, ease of use, or anything like that - it's just slow.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like Canon Cameras", "Author": "T.

In my opinion the A 3300 IS is not as well made as the A 2100 IS (which in my opinion is the best of the Powershot series of cameras).  The Canon Powershot A 3300 IS does have more features than a lot of its Canon Powershot predecessors, which I do like.  All in all, the Canon Powershot A 3300 IS, will outperform most of its competitors.

Some can be corrected with picture enhancement software.  Camera settings don't seem to help much - I've tried them all.

I tried the Panasonic DMC-ZS9, the Canon HX230HS, and the Fuji 505EXR.  None came close to my SLR and I felt the price of around $200 for those cameras at the time were a bit of let down.I have now been using this little guy for about a month or so.  It takes pictures a little bit slow but the images are pretty good.  Now they are not SLR quality but at $100 I could not be happier.  Very small camera.  The 5x zoom is generally adequate for my uses (taking to parties, dinners, etc. to just get some good friend snapshots).  I have not used the video mode much (it only has digital zoom in video and I am not sure why).  However, the digital zoom (which I generally dread to use) gives you a decent additional distance on the telephoto end when taking photos.Since I use the camera mainly for friends/family at night time events, the flash photography was essential.  So far, so good.  Everyone was enjoyed the results which are not overexposed.Great little camera when you just don't want to cart around a kit with enough zoom to give you some flexibility to reach out and grab your friends.  Aftermarket batteries are readily available and work great.  Got two replacement batteries for about $5.

My last one ( 890is ) died after 2 1/2 years and when I compare the images taken with it with the ones taken with Canon PowerShot A3300 IS 16.0 MP I can only say I am considering buying a used 890is. I have tested two Canon A3300: the first came probably damaged, it took pictures that were \"fractured\" - half good and half discolored and a couple of pixels off. The replacement came after three days and works, but the colours are unnatural, especially with flash on or auto in low light, and the images fuzzy and pixellated. For example, an image of the Christmas tree taken from 5 ft away shows fuzzy branches with the new camera, crystal clear needles on branches with the old 890is ( same tree, same light, same room, same year ). I need a point and shoot camera, not a SLR replacement, so I tested it only in full auto mode and I have no intention of fiddling with settings; that is why I need a point and shoot device. The conclusion is: DOES NOT WORK. Sorry Canon, you lost it.

I accepted this technique with my SLR, but I've never owned a point-and-shoot with this requirement. The manual had lots of instructions about charging the battery right before it will be used, depleting the battery between charges, and not leaving the battery plugged in for too long.

On the bright side, it's not necessary to drag along a laptop just to charge the battery.ADDITION: Now that I've had the camera for a few months, I just love how portable it is.

I've heard nothing but good things about the brand. After much research, I decided to get this model. I did not like it at all. The pictures all came out grainy and absolutely horrible.

I cannot say much else about this camera's features and specs because after about the 20th awful picture using all of the different modes, I simply put it back in the box and returned it. As for the body of the camera, it feels really cheap; even toy-like. The buttons are very flimsy and very loose.

In about two weeks I received a brand new unopen replacement.  Nothing has changed. All photos are very grainy and I am stuck with a piece of junk.  This is not my first digital nor is it my first digital Canon.  My first Canon was a 6mp which made FAR superior photos than this one.

I thought that being a Canon camera (I have a Canon t3i which is an exemplary camera, among other cameras made by Nikon, including an SLR, a DSLR and several point and shoot models), it would undoubtedly stand up to its manufacturer's name. But it does not.Not only does the camera take an exceedingly long time to focus, but it also seems to contain a light inhibitor (go figure) of some kind because it shoots well only in extremely bright sunlight. However, try using it indoors, and you will fail to achieve even reasonable images. EVERYTHING turns out blurry which leads me to believe there is a defect in the lens that does not allow sufficient light to enter through it. For comparison purposes, let me say that I had a Sony Cybershot that I purchased well over a decade ago, and while it has far less MP to its name (maybe 3 or 4 MP) it produces substantially better results than the newer Canon Powershot.To say that I am truly disappointed is to voice my concern in mild terms. I am only too sorry that I gave these cameras to my kids for Christmas (age range: 10-15 years of age). They were the ones who alerted me to how useless these things were. I honestly expected far more Canon.Save your money and go elsewhere.

I was hoping not.)I tried loading the software multiple times and STILL can't get the darned photos from the memory card to my computer.
