I was amazed when I tested this camera and its image quality against my Nikon D7000 with a Nikkor 18-200 mm lens. Image for image the NX20 and its 18-55 mm lens produced equal quality images, and for close work the images were actually better. No, it will not do all that my Nikon will do, but if your objective is to capture truly high quality images with a camera that is a fraction of the weight and size of a full body DSLR, then this is the camera for you..", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phil", "Author": "Elizabeth A.

Otherwise this camera is better than, say, Leica for me..because I love panoramas and do use 3fps shots to catch changing instants (expressions, quick movements etc).I also use a nx1000, usually with the 30/2 and find it's great for grab shots (assuming truly grab, framing instinctively).Both nx20 and nx1000 deliver VERY high resolution files...perhaps better than my Pentax k20D which is equal to the original Canon 5D despite APS vs full frame.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good.", "Author": "Texas Buyer", "ReviewID": "RF58MMZU51GSG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product appears to be a gray market item.
