{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great feature set, good value, WiFi, only average image quality", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R26281TOQ3M5K4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "2013-02-16 Numerous updates and edits made below.I will come back and update this review with more details as I have more time with the camera, but first impressions are good for the price paid (~130).  It is of plasticky construction, but solid and the build quality seems good.  No printed manual, but the manual (PDF) is on the CD and is quite detailed.  You can read on your PC. Tablet, or other device or print it out if you like.The big question for many seems to be the WiFi.  I have a pretty standard wifi setup and I had no problems at all.  I selected my network, chose the shared setting, entered the password (easy) and it connected right away.  No need to even read the manual, just turn the dial to WiFi and you can probably figure it out if you have set up many devices before.  Once this was done, I was able to easily upload images to my SkyDrive after entering my login info, again easy to do.  I was also able to email photos to my email account.  Transfers were quick (normal wifi transfer speeds) for the 4-6 images I tested with.  If you try to transfer 500 images it's going to take awhile, probably better to just remove the SD card and use your SD card reader (or plug the camera up via USB).  But for casual transfers of images it works fine.  So the Wifi was easy to setup and use in my opinion and works well.  USB->PC transfers were also easy and fast.  And, of course, you can pop out the SD card and use your PC card reader or external USB reader as well.Update: Also tested PC Autobackup via wifi which transfers all pictures from your camera to your PC.  This is the most efficient wifi mode and also preserves the image size and quality.  Many of the other modes (like SkyDrive, social media choices, compress the file size).  You have to install the software on your PC from the CD (which also contains the manual and Intelli-Studio software) and pair once via USB.  After that you can use the PC Autobackup option from the WiFi menu on the camera and everything works automatically and efficiently. You can also transfer pictures selectively while browsing via the playback menu.  In general, all of the wifi options I have tried have worked well.  There was one instance where a transfer \"stalled\" but when restarted it completed fine and there were no further issues.Update: In further use AutoBackup has worked fast and without any problems.  It is definitely the best mode for saving your images off the camera via Wifi.  You always have the option of using the USB connection or removing the card, but AutoBackup works well enough that I don't see any need for that unless some circumstances preclude it. This mode tracks what you have transferred and will only transfer new images/videos - nice!  Transfers are placed in a dated folder, also nice.The camera handles well.  The Menus and controls are OK and easy to use.  Full manual settings are available which is nice at this price point. SMART mode seems to work OK. Everything works pretty much like you'd expect.  Zoom toggle is a bit small, but it worked OK.PQ Update: Images look soft and a bit low contrast.  Picture quality seems about average for a P&S; travel zoom camera.  Colors are good, saturation on the lower end compared to many.  The biggest issue seems to be the aggressive noise reduction (due to the small sensor size) which smears details and causes a loss of sharpness. Contrast also seems low.  The end result is the pictures do not have the \"zing\" that most out of camera jpegs have these days, so many will be disappointed in the image quality, I think.  It is possible to add some color saturation, sharpness and contrast, but the loss of detail due to the small, budget sensor cannot be \"fixed.\" That said, apparent image quality when viewing at normal screen and print sizes is OK and this may not be a big issue for some people.  This is not a DSLR.  At this price, the quality is acceptable, and images can be tweaked in any decent editor (though the lost detail cannot be recovered). For casual use, I think it is OK.  I've seen other cameras in this price range with very similar issues.  The noise reduction smearing of small detail is the biggest negative, so if you like crisp details, this will not be a good choice for you.So, picture quality is acceptable, but not stellar.  With a bit of care, good images are possible and the wifi and other features are unique at this price level. Decide if you can live with that in exchange for the other fun features offered.  In casual use, most people are not going to notice a lot of this.  Enthusiasts will.The many various modes, scenes, and effects are all a fun plus.  The \"live panorama\" mode worked very well in my few tests so far.  I was quite impressed, actually.  I found the camera fun to use.  There is built in help that explains most of the choices on screen and the controls are well thought out (for the most part) and easy to figure out and use.So far, it looks like a decent deal at the current price.  Comes with battery, charger, USB cable, CD, and wrist strap, but no SD card.2013-02-16 Update: Video -  Surprise!  The relative quality of the videos are pretty good.  The 30fps 720p HD (1260x720) video tests I took looked pretty good.  Good color, saturation, contrast, and detail (for video) and all in all very acceptable.  The videos also transferred fine via AutoBackup over wifi, thought they take longer due to much larger file sizes.  Having an 18x optical zoom that works in video mode is a nice plus, too, and it works pretty well.  The video is as good or better than a lot of the small portable video cams I have used and they're in the mp4 format so almost all devices should be able to handle them well.  Sound is mono (as usual for low price cam video) but decent. So we have a bit of a \"sleeper\" here if you like to shoot video as well as stills.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super camera", "Author": "thecarace", "ReviewID": "R189XZ8YYIUIBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera, would have gave it Five stars if the wireless up load was faster.
