{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon carries problems forward with this new camera", "Author": "general principles", "ReviewID": "R2Y4K3R44LQY8A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Main objection, other than soft photos, is that the control dial cannot be reliably used [as necessary in manual mode for selecting shutter speed and aperture, and for manual focusing] without inadvertently pressing, and thus actuating, one of the other functions on the wheel, typically the iso but sometimes the self timer, although there are two other functions that can be pressed as well, putting the camera into a different configuration.  This poor design places this otherwise nice point-and-shoot superzoom camera in a class all by itself...a compromise at best.  A redesign with a much stronger spring to actuate the four functions would probably fix this deficiency.  Not sure of Canon's track record of installing kits to correct known problems. If the camera will not be used in manual mode and if soft photos are ok, the camera would be quite acceptable.  The HD capability, slow motion, as well as numerous other features are cool, but not at the expense of manual mode.  Oh, the battery is fantastic...made well over 400 shots on one charge.  Beats rechargable AA batteries (that will not work in my other Canon or probably any other Canon).", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "Debbie L.", "ReviewID": "RQJ4ASD68KYE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my camera and all the extras it came with.

Reason for 4stars is the bundle - was filled with products that were low quality & would not normally buy had I been looking for those items.  My main reason for getting this bundle over straight camera alone was it included a camera bag, and a spare battery.  Rest of the bundle was \u2018filler\u2019 but some things were OK like the SD Card wallet and the HDMI Interface cable (the table top tripod is OK for small cameras-I wouldn\u2019t trust with SX50). I figured the bundle was probably about $50 worth of items and the bundle was only $30 extra.  So to me it was worth it even if the other stuff is inferior quality", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am thrilled with this camera", "Author": "janet", "ReviewID": "R28RNRD7B33TSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made a grand choice when I picked this one.
