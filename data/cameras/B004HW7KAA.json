This happens both with group photos, and single portraits.  Viewing photos on the screen forces you to use your finger on the screen to drag them, and there is no option to press a button to scroll through photos.  The ikons are not intuitive.  The color of the photos is not accurate.  All faces come out red and flushed looking, and the retouch feature does not remedy this.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "why this is a big disappointer", "Author": "Erstwhile", "ReviewID": "R241AQB9M9X2YM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you've read the description, you know about all the great features. I grant them. Also, the industry's new standard number for megapixels is now 16. Hurrah. The quality of the output - the clarity of the pictures taken - is the bone of contention here. Why not give us - say, 3 megapixels, but include a good lens?My old Kodak Easyshare is four years old, 8mp, about $79.00, but takes about 150% sharper pictures with more realistic color. The pictures of this Lumix model (it appears to be the top in its class; I doubt the less expensive models are better able to give us the reality we all seek) viewed full size on a monitor are chalky at best, but usually smeary, and nothing among its automated settings intelligence can cover for a camera lens that's just there to make the camera function, but can never make your pictures look good, but only gigantic in size and memory.If you want lots of features and toys among your microchip's talents, and a pretty high price, but don't care about the quality of the pictures you take, this is the camera for you!Speaking of price, I was proud of shopping around for the best price, having found it here on Amazon. Wal-mart would have been $212.00 without tax. However, now I need to send this back to 6ave through Amazon, and I'll get stuck with a %15 restocking fee, and all the trouble of repackaging everything, and shipping it back to them at my own cost. Then I'll have to keep an eye on my CC bill to be sure I see the refund in a timely manner.Bottom line, I should have paid extra at Wal-mart. I would have received a full refund without questions, and sometimes without all the package's materials. Nothing against Amazon or 6ave, but I hope I will learn my lesson here, and never buy another item online that amounts to over $25 or so unless I know all the dark secrets beforehand about a return policy.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price", "Author": "J.
