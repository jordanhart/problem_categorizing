I saw a lot of reviews on the camera quality it self, but you can research the camera it self on any site (by the way, it is fantastic). One of my main concerns about purchasing this bundle it is the accessories that came with it. 1. The carrying bag was ok, seems pretty tough and sturdy, but it wont fit everything that came within the bundle. It is surrounded with pads and etc so your camera is definitely not gonna get hurt. 2. The tripod was fairly sturdy. At first it seems kinda weak because it feels kinda empty on the inside but it actually can stand a push or two (I compared with my friend's expensive tripod, and this one felt little weaker, but it is fair for the price). 3. SD card is fine. 4. The cleaning kit and the screen protector is also pretty good and contained most of the stuff you need to clean the camera (for the screen protector, i personally think it will be better if you let a professional do it for you). 5. The 55-200 mm lens is in very good shape. 5. For the Tele and Wide angle lens kit, it was okay. You better off getting an wide angle lens if you choose to take landscape shots. its \"okay\". Sums everything up, this bundle is great, everything within it seems very reliable and sturdy!!", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first DSLR", "Author": "Betsy F.", "ReviewID": "R303LAEXT4FC0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit daunted by the contents of the bundled items, but once I started using it, I fell in love.
