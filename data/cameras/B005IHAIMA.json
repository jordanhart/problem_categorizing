Bn Hadhram", "ReviewID": "RCOBYEHJPHW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update : Changed rating to 4 stars instead of 5, Original review remain below, So why i did that? it's because the video capture \"audio\" quality is awful if you shoot in silent environment (shooting a baby or at home with no noise around) the camera does a lot of UNAVOIDABLE annoying clicking sounds nonstop if you don't use a tripod, every NEX 5N is effected by that, until SONY fix this issue i don't recommend this camera for anyone who plan to take a lot of casual videos with itUpdate 2 : Sony finally admitted the flaw of the issue and they offer a fix/upgrade according to them here : [...](Original review) : First of all i just gotta say that I'm extremely satisfied with the NEX 5n, If you are like me you will spend hours/days researching about Camera samples/reviews/etc before buying a new Camera, problem is many websites are biased or contradict each other, many fans of a system whether it's Micro Four thirds/Sony NEX series and others might say our system is the best but in reality none of these 2 are the best, M43 can be the best for you or NEX series can be the best for you, some even prefer Fuji X100 etc there are plenty of mirrorless cameras right now, i have just gathered all the facts about each system for you here so the final call is yours and i wont be biased i assure you my fellow photographers :)*NEX 5n advantages over NEX 7 (I will speak about NEX 5n vs M43 and NEX5n vs previous Sony NEX Cameras in a second)1-If portability and size is your biggest concern NEX 5n is actually smaller and fits much easier in your pocket, It's also lighter2-Price wise, It cost about half the price of NEX7, and cameras advance so fast now, Investing in a body is not the best option if your budget is limited, Invest in better lenses is much better idea, like the Zeiss 24mm F1.8 E-Mount lens, you will get better results with NEX5n+CZ 24mm over NEX7+Kit lens, so if your budget is limited this can be a huge advantage3-The external Viewfinder of the NEX5n have 2 advantages over the one in NEX 7 first it can be titled, so you can shoot while looking at your feet instead of looking at what is front of you (good for stealth shots) and the second it's more comfortable to use in my honest opinion because it's placed in much better position4-Sensor Quality, Ignore the Mega pixels marketing race, Sony 16MP sensor is being used by Nikon D7000 which is a 1200 dollar camera yet the Sony NEX5n use an advanced 16mp sensor (better than the one in D7000) While the NEX7 got a 24mp it really lose to NEX5n performance in high ISO SO if HIGH ISO is a huge issue for you NEX 5n will win this round (It doesn't mean NEX7 performance is bad, It's just the NEX5n perform better at High ISO)5-The TouchScreen, First thing in your mind now is properly Touchscreen = Toy camera and useless, Well it's not and here is why, You can access ISO/Shutter/UI/etc much faster with the touch screen, we are talking about cameras with bare minimum set of buttons here the NEX7 got 1 more button only over the NEX5n, you can customize your buttons as you wish too, That's not the only advantage of the touchscreen, Sony is using a new \"track focus\" you can basically touch your target on the screen and he will be AF Tracked, much faster than moving to track a target via none-touch methods, the Focus track combined with the touch screen deliver amazing results really.6-NEX5n max ISO is 25.600 and MAX 16.000 ISO for NEX7 (for those who care about maximum ISO available)*NEX 7 advantages over NEX 5n1-24MP Sensor, this can be an advantage depends on your use, Do you do a lot of prints and low ISO? then this is the best option for you (over NEX5n) while NEX5n beat it at high iso, the NEX7 beat the NEX5n in low ISO, you will get more details,easier to crop/edit your photos due the higher details.2-NEX5n External viewfinder cost 350box.... so you are already near NEX7 price Territory if you plan to get NEX5n EVF3-With the NEX5n you can't use an external flash+EVF at the same time because both use the same propriety input slot, the NEX7 has a hot shoe (For Sony flashes) and Built in EVF so you can use both at the same time, even if you don't plan to use the hot shoe for a flash there is a built in flash which the NEX5n lack4-The NEX7 got this new TRI dial UI (there are 3 dials on the NEX7 versus 1 only for the NEX5n, there is a second virtual dial though in the touchscreen but i don't count it as real dial) The UI for the NEX7 will be more professional while the NEX5n UI is mostly for amateurs,So in Short it depends on the advantages of each camera, NEX7 might be better for you, however for me even after ignoring the price different a side the NEX5n is the better camera for me due the better high iso performance and portability mainly (I got access to a DSLR when needed but i want a smaller system for certain uses) if you want a more professional UI/hot shoe for flash/shoot in low ISO mostly and you want an EVF the NEX7 sounds like the better dealAbout the NEX C3 ignore it and get NEX 5n because for little more you can get much better camera NEX 5n-Touchscreen and option to use EVF (Nex C3 CANT use EVF)-Faster AF+shutter lag speeds /AVCHD 2.0 1080p60 28MBPS video instead of 720p30-AF track via touchscreen is amazing if you shoot kids, it will keep them on focus always-IR R.control / 10FPS which is much faster than nex C3-Better HIGH iso performance and range/ Much better Grip / Better battery lifeNEX5n get better sharper corners with any previous lenses compared to the older NEX3/5, sony have used Offset microlenses for the sensor so the older 16mm lenses which was soft in the corners will be sharper now and using manual lenses will get you better results with NEX5n over older NEX5 in the corners, which is similar to latest Lecia high end cameras, in short if you use manual lenses upgrading is a must your pictures will look much better believe me i have already tested it and the results are improved over my older NEX 5Shutter sound is quieter now when shooting if you set up electronic shutter through the menu, there is full manual control for video now which is not available in the old NEX 3/5, AF Micro Adjustment for up to 30 a-mount lenses with the LA-EA2, plus Auto-Correction of chromatic aberration/Vignetting/distortion with all Native E-mount lenses which can be turned on/off via menu settingsAbout NEX VS M43 i already own EPL1 and i will properly upgrade to EPL3 soon, i will not talk about M43 vs Sony cameras bodies because the advantage is clearly \"mostly\" for the NEX5n (bigger Dynamic range/ISO/etc)Sony NEX lenses have 2 issues as of September 20111-They are limited in numbers specially compared to M432-Most of them are made with no portability factor in mind whatsoeverI will speak more about lenses now, If you want an ultra wide angle zoom lens for the E-MOUNT it doesn't exist (That's my favorite lens) with the M43 you actually got more than 1 Utra wide angle lenses so not only you can get 1 but you can chose which to chose, if you want a fast pancake? none exist for the Sony E-mount lenes for now and none in the future roadmap sadly, the only small sony lens that exist is the 16mm F2.8 but it's too wide for a main lens for most people and it's not as sharp as i like until stopped down so not very friendly to use at night, the Panasonic 20mm F1.7 is great lens (not the best but for Size/performance it's great) if you want a pancake zoom? this might sound crazy but Panasonic is making a Pancake zoom lens with image stabilization too and so on,While it seems in theory that Sony can just release smaller lenses and win the best of both worlds, it doesn't seems like this is a concern for Sony right now, their 2012 lenses road map include 3 more huge zoom lenses and zero prime let alone a pancake lenses, the Sony upcoming 50mm F1.8 OSS while being very sharp from the samples i have seen (sharper than nikon/canon 50mm primes) it's actually BIGGER than both nikon and canon 50mm lenses for their DSLR which is puzzling to create a tiny body and never release tiny lenses for it at least as an option for those who rather use smaller lenses, Sony Officially unlocked their E-Mount to other lenses companies though so anyone can make Native E mount lens if they want, i only knows of Sigma upcoming E-Mount lens which is 30mm F2.8 small primeSo in short again depends on your use you might prefer m43 because of lenses choices over NEX, i can't get rid of m43 because wide shots is a MUST for me and none is available for sony as of now.About Samsung Mirrorless system, while the sensor size is the same as sony it's not as good as sony sensor (not even close) Samsung support is nowhere near sony or M43 too so I'm not interested in itFor manual lenses users NEX offer the best possibilities for you, you can adapt almost every lens using an adapter for manual focus lenses, using the Focus peaking/zoom functions make focusing a breeze and easy, the Offset microlenses is a huge bonus too, and lets not forget the crop factor (1.5X for NEX versus 2X for M43)Overall i recommend NEX 5n for anyone, it's hard to find anything similar in the market for the price right now (Amazing sensor/small camera/tilt LCD/shoots 1080p60 video/touchscreen/easy to use/etc), it does beat any Entry/mid range nikon/canon DSLR \"IF\" you are type of a person who just sticks to the zoom kit lens, NEX 5N got a better zoom Kit lens and the better sensor.I hope my thoughts about the mirrorless market for now was fair enough and i hope that my review was helpful :)", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review of the Sony NEX-5N by a dSLR owner", "Author": "LGO \"LG10\"", "ReviewID": "R2B55QCREKOUC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review from the point of view of a (Nikon) dSLR user.  My review will consist primarily of reviewing how a dSLR owner would assess the qualities of the Sony NEX-5N, how it fits in and how it can be integrated into an ecosystem where continued ownership of a dSLR is a given.  In the process, someone who does not own a dSLR will nonetheless get an understanding as to how the Sony NEX-5N is seen from the perspective of a dSLR owner, and will see its relative strengths and limitations vis-a-vis a dSLR.SENSORThe Sony NEX-5N uses a Sony 16mp APS-C sensor that is very similar to the sensor used in the Nikon D7000 and the Pentax K-5, both excellent performing dSLRs.  In all respects, my initial testing showed that the sensor in the Sony NEX-5N is almost at parity as my Nikon D7000, e.g., excellent dynamic range at base ISO 100 and excellent S/N performance at ISO 1600, 3200 and even the occasional foray to ISO 6400.SIZE, WEIGHT, HANDLING AND POCKETABILITYAs a long-time dSLR user now used to the size and weight of a dSLR with its fairly large and heavy weight lenses (e.g., Nikon D700+MB-D10 and 70-200mm f/2.8 VR II lens), the NEX-5N's most startling aspect for me was its small size and light weight.  Holding the NEX-5N without any battery and lens, the NEX-5N is so light and compact that it is practically like holding a point and shoot camera, only that it comes with a hefty hand-grip that makes it possible to hold the camera more securely and quite comfortably.Adding on the battery and the pancake 16mm f/2.8 prime lens adds substantially to its weight and heft but not to the extent as to be objectionable as a light carry compact camera.  This combo however is no longer what one would consider as a camera that can comfortably carry in a pocket unless the pocket is in a jacket or cargo/tactical pants pocket.  The Sony 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 is substantially an even bigger package but still fairly light weight.Despite its decent grip, I highly recommend that one buys a wrist strap for use with this camera.  While this camera comes with a shoulder strap, the light weight of this camera makes it very easy and comfortable to carry with one's hand and/or wrist.  The wrist strap also ensures that the camera is immediately available for use.  A shoulder strap is normally use to distribute the heavy weight of a camera over a bigger area but the light weight of this camera makes a shoulder strap unnecessary.  Moreover, a shoulder strap allows the camera to sway and dangle dangerously unless one holds it down.  This makes a wrist strap more ideal and convenient.CONTROLSThe NEX-5N does not come with the many dedicated buttons common to dSLRs but it functions well enough given its compact size and limited buttons.  The NEX-5N is controlled primarily either through the touch screen, the rear-rotary dials or a combination of both.  The touch screen lags a bit while the rotary dial is fast and instantaneous.As someone who shoots primarily on Manual Mode and on Aperture Priority, it was fairly easy to set the camera on this preferred mode.  Pressing the button above the rotary dial or touching the upper right hand corner of the touch-screen LCD will bring the user to the Menu Option.  From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.  It is obvious that the documentation that Sony provided with the camera was not designed for an experienced dSLR user but once I figured out where the shutter and aperture mode was on manual mode, it was very easy to set and use.On Manual Mode, the rotary dial controls the shutter setting.  Pressing on the \"Down\" button shifts the rotary dial control to Aperture and turning the rotary button allows the user to change the aperture setting.On Aperture Priority Mode, the rotary dial controls the aperture setting and pressing on the \"Down\" button allows the user to adjust the exposure compensation function.On both modes, pressing the \"Left\" button allows the user to change the Shooting Mode (single, continuous, timer, remote, bracketing).The ISO, White Balance and Metering Mode are easily accessed through the more ponderous menu option.  For whatever reason, Sony chose to group these functions under the \"Brightness/Color\" menu instead of under the \"Setup\" menu.Under the \"Setup\" Menu, there were a few goodies that are worth mentioning.  This camera allows the user to choose from 3 grid lines in the EVF.  The options available were: Rule of 3rds Grid (3 x 3 grid) , Square Grid (6 x 4 grid) and Diagonal + Square Grid (6 x 4 grid plus an x-grid).  In addition, the NEX-5N has an AF Micro Focus Adjustment function.  This is a very useful function when using prime lenses - something that the NEX-5N is well suited for.The NEX-5N has several buttons that can be programmed for various uses when in P A S M Shooting Mode.  I used 2 of these for ISO and White Balance.  Under the \"Setup\" Menu\", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.  I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.  I used Custom for Soft Key C and was able to add Metering Mode, AF Mode, Autofocus Area, and AF/MF functions.  Ignoring all these details on how to proceed with the setting, suffice to say that under my current setup, I have fast and very easy to shutter, aperture, ISO and WB - the minimum essential controls when using a dSLR.As an aside, one reason why I have easily adjusted to the NEX-5N's controls is that I currently use different camera models.  In contrast to my early experience when I used 2 cameras with similar controls (Nikon D300 and D700) which made switching between one camera to another easy and convenient, I have since sold my D300 and acquired a D7000 to use with my D700, as well as a Nikon D3100, Fujifulm X100 and Panasonic GH2.  This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.  My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.  This background will help the reader to understand why I have no specific objection to the controls of the NEX-5N which is contrary to what a significant number of dSLR owners have complained of.SHOOTING STANCEOne can take photos with this camera in 3-ways.  The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.  The second way is handheld, using an optional viewfinder.  The third way is on a tripod, using its rear LCD screen.Having previously owned several point and shoot cameras (e.g, Panasonic LX-3, Canon S-90, etc.), I am acutely aware of the limitations of the limitations in aiming, composing and focusing while using the camera's rear LCD screen with the arms extended forward.  This limitation eventually made me sell these cameras and made me choose the Fujifilm X100 and the Panasonic GH2, both of which features an integrated viewfinder.So what makes the NEX-5N different?  For one, an NEX-5N owner would have the choice of getting the optional electronic viewfinder for this camera.  Expensive but otherwise excellent, the EVF gives an owner an alternative of brining a small compact camera with an external EVF, or an even more compact package without the EVF.  Moreover, unlike cameras with built-in EVF (such as the X100, GH2 or the Sony NER-7), the optional external EVF in a Sony NEX-5N gives the owner an option to shoot with the EVF oriented 90-degrees upward.Even without getting the optional external EVF, the NEX-5N has the added advantage vs point and shoot with fixed rear LCD screen because the NEX-5N has an articulated rear LCD screen of the NEX-5N that can be positioned to approx. 80-degrees upwards so that one can aim, compose and focus while looking down and while holding the camera with two hands and with both elbows firmly tucked to one's side.  This is an eminently much more stable shooting position than a regular non-articulating LCD screen that requires the user to stretch out his arms, an inherently unstable shooting stance.Finally, using a tripod, the articulating rear LCD screen makes it easy to aim the camera with no need to activate live view button or switch or periodically pressing live view as the camera automatically shut this down sooner than one would want.  The camera can easily be positioned to the level of one's eye or at a lower position and flipped the camera screen upwards.As a side note, anyone wishing to install a quick release tripod camera plate need to be aware that the NEX-5N may require a specialized adapter plate.  Unless the quick-release camera plate is also narrow and slim, the quick-release plate will extend and unnecessarily enlarge the dimensions of this diminutive camera and thus sacrifice one of its advantages and attraction.  For now, I am using the same Arca-plate that I am using with the Fujifilm X100 but a customized plate which will conform to better hold and support this camera may be a more ideal setup.USING 3rd PARTY LENSESExcept for the Sony/Zeiss 24mm f/1.8 and the recently released Sony 50mm f1/.8 OSS (and possibly the Sigma 19mm f/2.8 and the 30mm /2.8), there aren't currently (as of this time of edit, 2012 May 20) many good native E-mount lenses available for use with the NEX System.  For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.  The adapter is almost as large as a Sony 16mm f/2.8 prime lens so using 3rd party lenses on the NEX-5N as I have done with my Nikkor lenses will result in a substantially bigger package than when using Sony's native designed for NEX E-mount lenses.The bigger package aside, I find it easy to manually focus my Nikkor lenses on the NEX-5N.  Sony has two features in the NEX-5N which makes manual focusing easy.  The first is \"peaking\" and the second is through image-magnification.  One has a choice of white, yellow or red to indicate which section is in sharpest focus.  The ability to choose the color to indicate \"peaking\" or the area with the sharpest focus is very helpful.  In addition to peaking, I also double check my manual focus accuracy by magnifying an image either by touching the touch screen at the point I want magnified or through one of the programmable buttons and using the scroll wheel.  My procedure is to use magnify first and rely on the peaking second once the image is magnified (1st level magnify).  In short, manual focus is easy, convenient and accurate.The bottom-design of the NEX-5N does not lend itself well to the mounting of a quick-release Arca plate.  While the lens mount of the NEX-5N is metal and quite sturdy, the NEX-5N is not particularly suited for use with bigger and heavier 3rd-party lenses without additional support.  What I have done thus is to use the same support I currently use with my GH2 when mated with Nikkor lenses with the NEX-5N.  This support makes use of an Arca plate supporting both body and lenses and thus relieving any pressure that would otherwise hang on the lens mount and the very thin tripod mount surface when using big and heavy lenses.  Mounted on a tripod and using live-view to compose and to focus-manually, I am able to capture superlative photos.  In this manner, I have no problem using my bigger Nikkor F-mount prime and zoom lens with the NEX-5N such as the Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8, Nikkor 180mm f/2.8 or Zeiss 100mm f/2.0 despite these lenses not having any dedicated lens collar.I have started testing the NEX-5N using my Nikkor lenses and comparing the image I captured using the same lens but mounted on the Nikon D7000.  This is not easy as it may seem because of the different mounting point when both cameras are mounted on a tripod.  It is early days yet but I would say that the images the NEX-5N produces are very close and is practically as good as the Nikon D7000.  Surprisingly, the images from the NEX-5N post-processed from is slightly sharper.  There may be several reasons for these ... such as a more stable tripod mount using the Arca-rail setup, a weaker AA filter, etc.VIDEOClicking sound during video: I typically use a tripod when taking video so this has not been an issue for me.  I do not foresee this becoming an issue unless I use the NEX-5N as a salt shaker while taking video.  =)Video is very good and is the closest in performance to my Panasonic DMC-GH2.  I would however still give the edge to the GH2 in terms of video quality.  Regrettably, the NEX-5N does not have the equivalent of the GH2's ETC which is essentially a 2mp 2.6x crop of the center-portion of the sensor.  The GH2's ETC essentially transforms a single focal-length prime lens to 2 lenses.The NEX-5N allows manual controls of the shutter, aperture and ISO setting during video.  The best video quality is still at 1080 24 with a write-speed of 24Mbps which translates to about 1GB for every 5 minutes of video.  1080 60p with a write speed of 28Mbps is useful for slowing things down and translates to about 1GB for approx. 4 minutes of video.OBSERVATIONSVibration free during shutter release: Despite the absence of a mirror that needs to flip out of the way, the shutter release of the NEX-5N is fairly loud and is nowhere as silent as the Fujifilm X100.  The shutter release sound of the NEX-5N is similar to that of the Panasonic GH2 - metallic sounding and kludgy.  The Nikon D7000 shutter sounds sounds better despite having have to flip up the mirror before shutter release.  With mirror-up, the D7000 was virtually vibration free during shutter release.  Beyond my concern for the sound, I am concerned as to how vibration free the NEX-5N is when mounted on a tripod during shutter release.  All my test shots showed however that this is nothing to be concerned about. Then I learned about the electronic first curtain shutter of the NEX-5N.  With this activated, all fears about any vibration during shutter actuation was completely eliminated.  Very nice Sony!Battery: Any dSLR owner will likely need an extra battery (or even two) for extended shooting with the NEX-5N.  Unlike a dSLR which consumes very little energy when using the optical viewfinder, viewing and composing the NEX-5N drains the battery and any bit of extended use will require a spare battery or two.Aspect Ratio: this camera allows the user to choose between a 3:2 or 16:9 aspect ratio for still photos.  Video is always in 16:9 ratio.ISO: The NEX-5N has ISO 100, and goes all the way to ISO 12,800.  With fast lenses, I mostly stay at ISO 1600 and below but do go up to ISO 3200 and even 6400 when needed.  In both cases, some delicate fine-tuning with noise reduction during post-processing will yield very good images still.  Auto ISO is available as an option.  I should add however that ISO adjustments can only be made in increments of 1-full stop instead of the usual 1/3-stop found in most dSLR (with the exception of my D3100 where ISO can be incremented only in 1-full stops like the NEX-5N).  I found this a bit disappointing initially but like my Nikon D3100, I learned to cope with it and it became less of an issue.WHITE BALANCE: What Sony takes in terms of limiting the ISO increment adjustment it gives back in the WB setting.  I prefer to set my WB manually using the Kelvin setting and here, the Sony NEX-5N has smaller increments in its Kelvin setting adjustment than my dSLRs, including the Nikon D7000 and D700.  Live view and manual WB Kelvin adjustment is a wonderful combo which allows finer WB adjustment where a custom WB may not work due to the fast changing light condition.  I am very happy with this feature in the NEX-5N - which makes me wonder why the dSLRs do not have this capability.16mm f/2.8 pancake prime lens: With a 35mm equivalent FOV of 24mm, it would have been nicer if this lens had a wider-opening aperture.  Despite being a pancake lens, this prime lens is big enough that it actually is wider than the NEX-5N both at the top and at the bottom.  Its center section is very good while the borders and corners require stepping down before these become acceptable.  Due to its 24mm FOV, one needs to exercise a bit of care in aligning the horizontal and vertical axis of the image to minimize distortion when shooting people, specially those at the edge of the image.  I personally would have preferred a faster 18 to 20mm pancake prime than 16mm lens to minimize distortion as the NEX-5N with a pancake prime would likely be carried and see a lot of action in many people gathering.Integrated EVF: I also have a NEX-7 on pre-order but the 16mp sensor of this NEX-5N in a NEX-7 body would be an even better camera.  The ability of this camera to shoot excellent photo at low ISO and clean images at ISO 1600-3200 would make it a much more versatile all-purpose camera (like the Nikon D7000) than a NEX-7 with its current 24mp sensor which is more than 1-stop lower in S/N at high ISO.It is of course understood that the 24mp image from the NEX-7 down-sampled to a 16mp image like the NEX-5N would yield almost the same noise performance but one would first have to allocate more resources for a 24mp file size then downsample it to 16mp to get the same yield.  I would much prefer to just stay with 16mp from the start as it is unlikely that I will be printing large files.  When I do, I can just take several 16mp photos and merge these and get the high resolution image I need.Moreover, the high pixel density of the NEX-7 sensor means that lens diffraction occurs  earlier at practically a little past mid-aperture settings.  The NEX-7 disadvantages means that one can use the NEX-5 more than 1-stop higher in ISO setting for low-light and/or 1-stop lower in aperture setting for greater DOF in landscape photography without hitting the lens diffraction zone.While one can use the optional EVF and get the same image and functionality of the NEX-7, the fragile mount of the external EVF will require greater care in its use.  An integrated EVF would be better.  Nonetheless, I ordered the external EVF and will include a review of it here once I have more hands-on time with it.CONCLUSIONThe NEX-5N provides a dSLR owner with capabilities that is generally not as easily accessed with a dSLR.  A small, compact and light body plus a small compact and light prime lens is an attraction in itself but is perhaps best appreciated when I can pack 3-4 of these in a bag that would normally accommodate only one dSLR with zoom (Nikon D7000, MB-D11 and 17-55mm f/2.8).  It makes a very nice supplement to a dSLR but it will not and cannot replace a dSLR.As a dSLR owner and using the NEX-5N without an electronic viewfinder (EVF), I see the he NEX-5N as best used for tripod-mounted live-view shooting where its articulating screen, peaking, image magnify in one-button push or a light touch on the touch-screen really plays to the NEX-5N strength.  Its ability to mount larger zoom lenses that are without integrated lens collars is easily addressed using an Arca rail.  So equipped, it is even more stable than a large dSLR for tripod shooting as it can be mounted at its center of gravity rather than the typical below the camera butt plate when using a dSLR.  I regularly use my Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8 and my Nikkor 180mm f/2.8D with the NEX-5N in this manner and the images are simply superb.Without an EVF and shooting handheld, I typically hold the NEX-5N at waist level with both my arms tucked to my side to steady the camera.  With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.  It's not as easy, fast and as intuitive when using a dSLR with an optical viewfinder but it works out pretty well after some degree of practice.With an EVF and shooting handheld: I will be getting my EVF in 2 days and I will update this review.  (To be continued)Update:  Feb. 11, 2012I have been using the NEX-5N and the Zeiss 24mm f/1.8 with the Sony FDA-EV1S EVF for over a month now and it is a joy to use.  The EVF is bright and clear and its ability to articulate to 90 degrees allows me to get low-angle shots without too much exertion in bending down.  A little leg-bend is often enough to do the trick without need for me to get down on my knees to shoot low.  For those times when I do get down on one knee to take a shot, I can take an even lower angle in my shots.Coming immediately from using a dSLR, I do notice a short lag when compared to the optical viewfinder of a dSLR.  But after a few minutes of use, I quickly adjust and hardly notice the lag.  The EVF can be used for low-light shooting but there is room for improvement.  But in comparison to the other EVF-equipped cameras I have (GH2 and X100), this is the best EVF I have used and have no qualms in rating the EVF performance a 5-star.What makes me a bit more concerned is that the EVF is mounted rather precariously on the NEX-5N.  This is a concern when carrying the camera on a shoulder strap.  A hard side-swipe on the EVF could easily damage this rather expensive EVF.  I have thus acquired a binocular strap for the NEX-5N that prevents swaying and keep it in my front and center just below my chest  to better protect it.The EVF also protrudes rather prominently from the NEX-5N and makes storing the erstwhile diminutive and compact NEX-5N a bit more difficult.  I have had to rearrange the storage paddings in my Lowepro backpack and Pelican Bag and because of the EVF, the NEX-5N now needs a much bigger space than it did for storage.This handling, carrying and packing concern notwithstanding, I still rate the EVF a 5-star because of its performance.

I have realized that for somewhat serious amateurs like me, the dSLR is no longer the answer.  I need the quality without the bulk.  I need wide angles.  I need smart focus, face focus, face exposure because, well, I have a 1 1/2 year old who is moving fast in many different situations.  Pointing a fat dSLR lens at him which cannot track him only looks worse at 18MP.  I have previously used the Sony Nex 5, which is a totally different camera.  The 5N is much more a serious amateur camera with better high ISO, higher Auto ISO, corrects for lens distortion (huge benefit) and no longer automatically underexposes to save the highlights.  Serious amateur photographers know that every camera has certain unique aspects about them.  This model year camera underexposes a bit, this one overexposes a bit, etc.  This only comes by experience using the camera.  I have not used the 5N long enough, but I can already tell it is in a just a bit higher league than the 5.  But all these new mirrorless camera are better for amateurs because they help us frame the shot.  Many people will say that a viewfinder is critical for photography.  I am not on that side.  I think that during the brief moment from film SLRs to digital SLRs, many photographers were using compact cameras with their screens on the back.  Like myself, many people learned to frame a picture better like this.  Of course, the older photographers don't like this because their near sight is not good due to age, but by framing a larger view (from a screen on the back), you can still keep 2 eyes on the subjects and enviorns.  I don't expect many people to understand this, but you get better framing with a large screen on the back, hence the inclusion of \"live view\" with dSLR.  Also, with the Sony NEX cameras, the camera will easily and silently focus video, which a dSLR cannot.  I've been seeing all these videos shot with dSLRs lately and can tell 2 things: 1.  the focus doesn't move because they can't do it easily, 2.  when there is motion, either panning or subject motions, everything is a blur.  Forget all of that, with kids, you need wide angles because you want to catch a kid with their enviornment.  Try finding an affordable wide angle (<28mm) on a cropped dSLR sensor.  None of them cheap.  With the Sony NEX you can get a 24mm for cheap and then add a cheap adapter and get 18mm.  Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.  The compactness, the lightness, the quality of the sensor (as good as my dSLR by all measures), the  ease of wide angles makes this a no brainer.  It has the latest tech all to help the photographer like Auto highlights to even out exposures because sometimes we have to shoot at noon.  It has face recognition exposure to keep faces exposed correctly.  It has a cool stop motion 6 merged shots to look even better than one with super high ISO.  A fun auto stiching panorama mode.  Before I forget, it has a touch screen to pinpoint focusing and to swipe playback like an Iphone.  Sony has everyone beat at this point because they have more real feature to help the photographer and have the best performing sensor in the market.  10FPS! on a consumer camera- that is amazing.  They should've called it the 'Amazing' 5.EDIT: After a few months of becoming my standard carry with me camera, I have these thoughts:  The ability to attach any lens is great but time consuming.  Generally, the standard zoom is more revealing and more convenient.  Technique is more important.  The sensor quality is just as great as originally- Images have bite, but some may say that it is not Leica-like smudgey/creamy.  Just wait for Sony's 35mm F1.8 E series.  That will put the cream in your coffee.  Not really a PRO camera as the spinning wheel is too easy to activate with your thumb.  Really a good stealth camera like a Leica- \"snick, snick\" is all anyone will hear.  Tech helps- faces expose better, tracks eyes better.  Rarely use flash, but flash itself is good.  Tough- I even dented the lens.  Very stealth with the flipout screen.  Feels like a more intimate camera to get creative with than a machine gun.

Problems fixed. The new bathes of the NEX-5N should have this issue resolved.

The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.  It appears to be a mechanical defect inside the unit.  The problem was first discovered and acknowledged immediately after the unit first began shipping in September 2011.Sony acknowledged the defect and issued a weasel-like statement on its website saying that the \"phenomenon\" only occurs \"if the camera undergoes sudden motion while recording; motion generally inconsistent with smooth video recording.\"  An artful way of basically saying it's the user's fault for not holding the camera still during video recording.  This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.  The only way to avoid the clicking sound is to record on a tripod; if you use it as a handheld at all, it will click.  There are a ton of videos on YouTube showing examples of the clicking and how easily it can be triggered, even from a slow horizontal sweep of a landscape.  Sony has offered what they call a \"performance improvement\" (translation: repair) that they say reduces the clicking sound resulting from motion during movie recording.After calling Sony support, I learned that I had to send my brand new camera back to Sony, wait several business days for them to fix it and ship it back.  They only do ground shipment (to/from Laredo, Texas), which means that my brand new camera will probably be out of service for quite a while.To say the least, I'm disappointed with Sony.  Any reasonable testing suite would have uncovered this defect before the units were shipped, so the only logical conclusion is that Sony knew of the defect but decided to ship it anyway.  And then later, when the camera was released, the company played dumb, blamed its customers, and offered a \"performance improvement\" to pretend that it was doing them a favor.  Wow, what a voyage Sony has traveled since its status as the iconic consumer electronics company it was in the 1980s and 1990s, and it is no surprise that today its most profitable business unit is from one of its subsidiaries that sells insurance.I purchased the camera in December 2011, figuring that because the problem had been diagnosed many months ago, the company would have addressed the problem with all units in the channel that had not yet reached customers.  But no, Sony is doing nothing to fix the problem on units that haven't reached customers -- they're just playing the numbers, hoping to save money because some percentage of customers may not use the video or demand that the defect be fixed.***  UPDATE 01/16/2012  ***This is an excellent camera when it comes to picture quality, so in the end, I did end up going through the Sony \"support\" program to get my \"improvement\" for the camera rather than returning it for a refund.  But video recording is a major feature of this camera, and the clicking sound makes video recording largely useless, so keeping the camera in its current form was not an option for me.I sent the camera to Sony's service center in Laredo, Texas, and it came back from Sony in a nice brown box, professionally packaged.  The total turnaround was a couple of weeks, but I had to pay the shipping to Sony.  It's the same unit (same serial number).  A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.  The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.  (I left the shoulder attached to the unit when I shipped it, and it was still attached to the camera in the exact same place, which makes me suspect the case wasn't even opened.)  You can still hear the clicking even from outside the unit if you move it, even if it's not on, which confirms there's still some mechanical problem in there.  Maybe a mix-up in Laredo.  Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.  But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.  One star.***  FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.  Craigslist, here I come!

Awesome Still Images and Video Quality", "Author": "FiveForm \"FiveForm\"", "ReviewID": "R1826BGE0RN7OB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.  I work in technology, presently, and have owned digital cameras since 1990 when the first consumer digital camera, the Logitech Fotoman, came out which produced 320 x 240 pixel B&W; images.  Since that camera, I've owned over 35 digital cameras and have witnessed the evolution of digital imaging, with great excitement, to the present day.All the while I've been waiting for the size and weight of digital SLR's to come down.  This has now been accomplished by most manufacturers with some very small true SLR's from Nikon, Canon, etc., along with a huge amount of point-and-shoots from all manufacturers.The challenge for me, which kept me buying, was to find the quality of a digital SLR (APS-C variety) to fill the void between the relatively low image quality of the P&S;'s and the ponderous size of high quality SLR cameras.  I find that I really can't carry my Nikon D300 or even D90 all day on field trips to cities that I shoot without being worn out at the end of the day (\"Father Time\" isn't any help in this equation, either).Enter the Sony Alpha NEX-5N.  I passed on the original 5N do to the cost and the fact that I have 4 cameras presently in play.  I got the 5N primarily as something to play around with, not thinking that it would rival or replace my Nikon SLRs.  The high ISO quality and resolution at most ISO's really amazes me.  Although the 18-55mm kit lens isn't the highest quality it is substantial enough to render some really nice images.  Anything I'm not totally satisfied with can be tuned up in LightRoom, anyway, as are all of my images.I carried the NEX-5N around New York City this past weekend and didn't even know I had a camera around my neck!  It is that light!  Some have written in their reviews that they want a wrist strap for their 5N's.  Personally, I stay away from them.  Once you strap something around your wrist you really lose the use of one hand, unless you want to bang the camera into everything.  The neck strap allows you to pick the camera up when you need to shoot and have both hands free as you are moving around doing other things.  I recommend the Optech Classic straps with the loop connectors.  Not too bulky for such a small camera and only around $20.I plan on getting the \"Trufinder\" OLED eye level viewfinder in November when it comes out, albeit with the Sony high price.  Certainly, I don't plan on getting rid of my Nikons which are used for studio photography as well as field photography.  As yet, there is no way to directly link my studio electronic flash to the 5N, other than tweaking down the power and using the photo eyes on the sudio flash to sync with it.  The supplimental flash is actually pretty decent, by the way, and is really tiny, in keeping with the size of the camera.A few negatives preventing the NEX-5N from achieving perfection are: The size being almost too small for some hands, (I've read that the 7N is slightly larger with better ergonomics, but at double the price, I'll wait), video audio clicking sounds that Sony has acknowledged are not just our imagination (I don't shoot enough \"quiet video\" for that to matter, but video HD qualtity on my Sony Bravia is stunning!), and the current lack of lenses which should improve over time.  Also, the somewhat klugey menu interface is clumsy, but I have assigned the most used functions to the soft keys which makes changing ISO, white balance, metering methods, etc., direct.Finally, with all the tech toys and tools coming out at the rate that they do, we should all remember the one golden rule of tools and technology:  \"The most flexible element in the interface between humans and machines is the person, him or herself.\"  We forget that when we use something enough, we adapt, by nature.

which addressed those two problems. I am very pleased with Sony NEX-5N.  If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun. SONY will have an OLED high resolution view finder for NEX series in November 2011. However the mount on the OLED electronic viewfinder is only compatible with NEX-5N and is not compatible with NEX-C3.Update: I now own the OLED view finder. Love it. For more details you can see my review of it: http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNWAESUUHR49/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_8The second issue was ability to easily override the automatically chosen a focus point.  NEX-5N has a touch screen which allows one to point where the focus should be, and sometimes this allows you to compose a photo which focal point off-center (automatic focus has a strong preference for items in the center).WEIGHTThe weight of the camera with 18-55mm lens, battery, memory card, and strap is 17.1 oz.The body of the camera is 4 1/8 inches wide x 1 inch wide in the narrow part. It is small but not so small that is inconvenient to hold or operate. Overall the camera feels good in your hand, the mechanical parts (hinges and other controls) feel well made and pretty sturdy. The 18-55mm lens in its smallest configuration is 3 inches long.FAVORITE FEATURESFeatures that I loved, two features I never had in other cameras I owned:* Sweeping panorama - I absolutely loved it! It worked fantastically even hand held taking photosof night time skyline. (I am attaching a photo showing this feature)* Anti blur - in addition to having Optical Steady Shot this camera has an option for hand-held night shots.It takes 6 photos in quick succession and combines them to generate one shot reducing blur due to unsteady hands.Note: these settings produce JPEG format even when the setting is set to RAWPHOTO QUALITYI am pleased with the quality of the photos. I was very impressed with low light performance. I was able to take crisp hand-held pictures of New York skyline using the \"anti blur\" setting. With sweeping panorama option I do not feel the need for a wider lens. I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used. I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N. The entire pack costs less than one extra SONY battery: Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-FW50, Alpha SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A55V, NEX-3, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-7, NEX-C3USER INTERFACENEX-5N has a touch screen which allows one to point where the focus should be, and sometimes this allows you to compose a photo which focal point off-center (automatic focus has a strong preference for items in the center).By twicking display options I was able to make the UI easy to navigate. The most helpful setting was \"Big font\" under Camera options. Not only did it make the text easy to read, it removed a larger number of least useful icons which de-clutters the display.The changes I found  helpful:* Turned off pop up help (located under \"Setup\" and called \"Help Guide Display\")Why: The pop-up help gets in the way of every operation, you cannot see the screen as it totally obscureswhat you are looking at, when you get rid of pop-up then the screen you were looking at also goes away.* Turned off object tracking (located under \"Camera\" top menu)Why: When you are trying to compose a photo where the focus is NOT in the center, you can use the touch screento indicate where the focus should be. However, if the object tracking is turned on the focus begins movingand shifting even though the thing you are trying to focus on is not moving. The camera prefersitems in the center of the photo, rather then a composition using 1/3 rule.* Turned off face registration and smile shutter (located under \"Set Up\")Why: these options got in the way of a good photo compositionTRIPODI was able to use the tripod quick release I use for my SLR. The quick release plate is a wider than NEX-5N body. It extends both in the front and the back of the camera. You cannot balance the camera on it (it tips forward), however once it is on the tripod it is very secure. I am attaching a photo which demonstrates the fit of the quick release.PHOTOSHOP COMPATIBILITYEdited 10/23/2011:  When I originally purchased the camera Photoshop CS5 did not recognize the RAW format produced by NEX-5N. However today I downloaded the latest CS5 update and now it recognized ARW files generated by NEX-5N.PHOTOS INCLUDED with this review (see under customer photos)1) Hand-held panorama shot at twilight showing a sail boat leaving New York Seaport with the skyline on the right. Split image in the same photo is a portion of the sail boat mast in actual pixel size, so you can see the details of the noise.2) A shot of the New York seaport taken with the camera on the tripod. In the split image you see three sections of the photo in actual pixel size. #1 is close to the left edge, #2 is center, and #3 is a section close to the right edge. You can see the difference in sharpness between the center and the edges in the close ups.3) Photo shows the fit of the tripod quick release plate. I am able to use the same quick release I use for my DSLR.Disclaimer: My interest is still photography and I have not used the movie option yet.Overall, I am pleased with this camera.

Kleiner", "ReviewID": "RKDXB1HB0GZ6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this camera really is the \"best of both worlds.\" You get the incredible Sony APS-C sensor providing DSLR-quality images with very low noise at higher ISO's, and great JPEG processing, but additional benefits include those typically found in consumer compact cameras. There's a multitude of creative options to produce dynamic images without the need for post-processing on your computer. The images are basically ready to go, unless you want to crop out smaller pictures from the high-res 16mp canvas.Sony has jammed in awesome panoramic, HDR, 3D and other great features into this little guy, while still making it relatively easy to go with the \"manual\" PASM shooting modes. I do wish there was a bit more flexibility with setting custom buttons (there are only three physical buttons that you can customize, and it doesn't allow for ALL functions to be used.) Sony, if you read these Amazon reviews, please add the option to control shooting mode from the bottom-right button on the camera! ;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster. 10 frames/second is pretty awesome to see come out of this tiny camera, and it surely helps to get that perfect action shot or facial expression.The camera is VERY LIGHT. The e-mount lenses are also VERY LIGHT. This is great as far a lightness goes, however it makes the camera seem a bit toy-like and definitely takes some getting used to. I can't imagine an APS-C camera being any smaller or lighter. Since this is not a pocket-able camera, I think make Sony should have made it a little wider and taller (perhaps the NEX-7 size is better for the adult hand?). Also, the articulating screen seems a bit flimsy and the touch control is certainly not the same technology found in current smart phones. The screen almost seems \"soft\" and easily scratched if you are not really careful. Not a huge deal, the screen is sensitive and the touch control offers nice benefits, just be careful.Regarding the \"clicking\" noise you have seen in many reviews, YES, my first camera from Amazon was plagued with this problem as well. I received this camera around 11/10 and called the next day for a replacement. Lucky for me, the replacement that arrived two days later does not have the loud clicking issue (however it does make a faint sound if you move it quickly - I'm guessing this will not affect sound during videos). Point is, we're halfway into November and Amazon is still stocking some defective units.I have had a difficult time finding a suitable camera bag/case/sling to house the camera plus several lenses. If Sony wants to promote the idea of swapping multiple lenses (which require BUYING multiple Sony lenses) they should certainly come out with a mini version of the DLSR backpack or case. Most all I have been able to find are small compact cases and the typical large DSLR + multi lens cases. I was lucky enought to discover the Lowepro Impulse 110 [...]) which does the trick for me, but I would love to get a small sling or backpack that can accommodate several lenses in addition to the camera, with room for filters, flash and microphone (but without the bulk of the current stock of DSLR bags).So, all the nit-picking withstanding, this camera gets two thumbs up from me. Stunning photo quality, fun in-camera processing options, compact and light body and lens selection, and overall solid build. I have been waiting patiently for mirrorless technology to improve to the point where the avid photographer can get the \"best of both worlds,\" and this camera is it.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing! And no clicking!", "Author": "JLondon", "ReviewID": "RT8VVPD222O96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX-5N is absolutely amazing.  The photos it produces are stunning.  I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.  I barely ever have to use the flash.  Even at night with nothing but moon light.  I ordered my camera on March 26th and received it on March 28th.  The first thing I noticed when taking it out of the Amazon box was that there was no factory seal on the camera box itself.  When I took the camera out, I immediately noticed that there was no clicking noise at all and then thought it was weird that not only was their no seal on the box but there was no sticker on the LCD either.  With a quick google search I found a forum explaining the lack of factory seals on some NEX-5N's.  Basically, due to the recent tsunami in Japan, Sony had to move production to another factory which does not put factory seals nor LCD stickers on the cameras.  However, camera's coming from that factory also have no \"clicking\" issues.  So, don't freak out if your box doesn't come factory sealed.  Most likely you got one that has had the clicking noise resolved and is indeed new and straight from the factory.  If you still have doubts, make sure that the serial number on the bottom of the camera body matches the number on the box.  If they match you're good.  If not, send it back.Now, back to the camera.  Every photo is so crisp.  About HDR painting mode (found in Menu > Brightness/Color > Picture Effect > Pntg)  just in case you can't find it.  It took me a few days to figure it out.  Oh, and you can change the intensity to low, medium and high as well by first selecting HDR Pntg and clicking \"Option\" (it appears on the bottom right of the display).  Photos using this setting, taken with under the right lighting conditions, produce stunning results.I usually stay away from Intelligent Auto simply because I like to have more control.  Aperture Priority is what I use most of the time.  It's perfect for taking portraits with blurred backgrounds.Battery life is what you would expect.  Not the best, but not bad either.  I have yet to run out of power before I get the photos I want.That's about it for now.  If I think of anything else, I'll update my review.If you are on the fence, fall off (on the Sony NEX-5N side) and buy it already.  You will NOT be disappointed.  What you get for the price can't be matched by any other DSLR.  Not to mention most Nikon DSLRs use Sony sensors anyway.  Might as well just cut out the middle man.Hope this helped some of you.Peace out.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Video \"clicking\" noise issue fixed", "Author": "Jiunjr Feng \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R2PA8WIGZ6KKM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most customer reviews already pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of NEX5N.

I don't like the sacrificing image quality for my personal photos, and now thanks to the NEX 5N I don't have to. The low light capabilities are completely on par with the already class leading 7D. The practical burst mode of 4fps is ideal for most family situations (the 10fps mode doesn't focus between shots, so that's a specialty mode in my opinion). The camera shoots raw, but now that Lightroom 4 updated the develop module so the same preset works for JPEG and RAW, I find I prefer JPEG most of the time, for non and semi-professional output. The JPEGs benefit from automatic lens corrections, nicer color response, and a much smaller file size with quicker camera response. The intelligent ISO is good for an auto mode, and if you just want DSLR quality without all the bulk stop reading and buy it now, but if you want to use this as a real camera you MUST go into the menu and change a few things first:1) First go to one of the PASM modes from the shoot mode menu, then MENU -> SETUP -> Custom Key Settings... Change Soft Key B to something other than help (I use shoot mode since I switch between PASM modes a lot), then Change Soft Key C from Shoot Mode to Custom... this lets you set up the button in the middle of the dial as a swiss army knife type button (I have it set to edit WB, Raw/Jpeg, ISO and AF/MF), you can also edit the right button to something else you need often I use this for ISO too (the auto ISO will go up to 3200, but I'll use 6400 when conditions call for it).2) Set up the camera to shoot without a NEX/Alpha lens MENU -> SETUP -> Release w/o Lens -> Enable. This will let you via adapters use almost any lens ever made (albeit in manual focus... the plus side is MF is pretty easy if you use focus peaking... See next tip)3) For video (where autofocus is a distraction when it hunts) or with manual focus lenses you will want to turn on focus peaking. First set the camera to MF (using the custom key mentioned in tip #1 or in MENU -> CAMERA -> AF/MF Select) or you can't enable peaking... then MENU -> SETUP -> Peaking Level... and select Low, Medium or High and a color and you will see colors appear around items that are high contrast (i.e. sharply focused), it works really well for most things, it's not quite precise enough to get critical focus on an eye with f/1.4 lens, but for most portraits and video work it does a great job outlining the in focus subject.4) For my tastes I also disable the beep, I don't like the camera drawing attention to itself... so MENU -> SETUP -> Beep -> Off.I could go on about how great the video is, the swivel screen, the go anywhere attitude, the snappy response, etc... But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge. My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.- The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.- The flash is difficult to screw on with large hands and doesn't aim up for bouncing off a low ceiling.- Ummm I heard that it overheats and cuts video shorter than it's max (but I've recorded 15 minutes with no problem, and don't expect to exceed that anytime soon). Besides, my 7D only records 12 minute clips in HD.- The lack of a viewfinder take some adjusting to, and adding it is half the price of the camera. Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.- There are a few buggy things like when I tilt the screen the MF assist square moves to the bottom left corner... but these bugs are not common in most shooting situations.- It's only pocket-able if you have the 16mm f/2.8 lens, but it's still a lot smaller and lighter than my main kit.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a mirrorless with a lot of control and power (once you customize the settings), or those moving up from P&S; cameras to gain image quality and a speedy lag free experience with a powerful auto mode. If you want more dials and a viewfinder and have the budget to spare of course the NEX 7 is worth a look and if you don't need quite as much speed the NEX F3 is a good option as well.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "NEX 5n An excellent substitute for an expensive DSLR", "Author": "JRH \"j5094\"", "ReviewID": "R30KMXBC2R6UMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are so many positive reviews, that I will stick to just a couple of items. 1) The problem with the clicking noise during movies appears to be gone with the newer versions of the NEX-5N. At least my NEX-5N is completely noise free. 2) The menu system leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to simplicity of operation. However, if you are taking pictures in the IA mode (Intelligent Automatic), the camera is wonderfully simple to operate, and the results are outstanding. You can take a picture of a complex scene and then select just a tiny portion for viewing using the touch screen. The blown up tiny portion will be sharp, properly colored, and noise free. The same is almost true for dim indoor scenes, with only the slightest hint of noise in the shadows of an object against its background. This is better than most DSLRs costing twice as much. The next unusual feature of this camera is the ability to take panorama pictures. The default is horizontal left to right. An arguably better mode is holding the camera vertically and sweeping left to right (or right to left). To change this setting, after you have selected panorama from the virtual wheel, you have to go into the menu system. You might search for something to do with panorama - wrong. You have to go to \"Image Size\" and then down to Panorama to change direction. The instruction manual details this. If this were the only slightly buried item, I would say no problem.  The bottom line on the panorama capability is that is produces excellent results with almost no effort. This feature alone makes SONY cameras an outstanding buy for people who do not wish to spend their lives in Photoshop.One of the strong features of this camera is being able to go into manual mode on the virtual wheel. Then, of course, you would like to change shutter speed, f/stop, and the ISO setting. The mechanical wheel will change the shutter speed, and then pushing in the lower portion of the wheel will switch to the f/stop. Now, how do you get to the ISO, which is displayed right next to the f/stop.  It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.  By then, the picture you are trying to take is no longer available.  It should be directly reachable from the screen that allows the shutter speed and f/stop without going back in the menu system.I must say, that everything you might want to do with the NEX-5N is there in the menu system - somewhere. The learning curve for this camera can be steep, and frequently changing modes is unnecessarily awkward. For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency. You can program these settings for quick access. This saves the day and makes the camera much more useful. The touch screen is surprisingly useful for switching between the many options and returning to the main menu, switching between pictures in the image review mode, zooming in electronically on existing images, and selecting an object to focus on when shooting an image.This is an excellent camera. Hopefully, SONY will provide some modifications in firmware upgrades to make the camera a little easier to use. This is one of those cases where you have such an excellent camera that just a few tweaks could make it even better,  easier to use and more intuitive. As it is, the NEX-5N is already easy to use for most picture taking selections. I highly recommend this camera.One final note, I wound up buying the camera from one of Amazon's recommended external sellers, Cameta Camera. I have the highest praise for dealing with Cameta. They are friendly and helpful with no nonsense or pressure tactics. The shipment was well packaged and they were prompt.

The photos and video this camera delivers are sharp and everyone I share the photos with online are stunned when I show them the camera.I chose the Sony Nex 5N over the NEX 7 after strongly considering getting the latter.  I found that I prefer the 5N's touchscreen which aids in focusing and changing menu items on the fly. The NEX-7 had a different feel to it and I don't typically like using a viewfinder because of my poor vision. Also, I recognized that the greater megapixel of the NEX-7 (at 24.3 MP) versus the NEX-5N (at 16.1 MP) would generate very large image files and I didn't see much value in that, at this time.As there are already tons of reviews on the wonderful handling and capabilities of this camera I just wanted to share my enthusiasm and satisfaction with this incredible device.ACCESSORIES (Great tools to enhance your experience in the field) -1.

I have enjoyed that camera for years, and it's done great taking photos for portraits, weddings, family events, and outdoor/landscape stuff.  I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.  I learned about mirrorless cameras as a \"bridge\" between point-and-shoot and DSLR cameras, and from my reading, these new NEX camera sensors were rivaling their DSLR counterparts (low-mid end DSLRs).I decided to take the plunge and try one out.  The newer NEX-5N seemed to be the popular pick, with big improvements over the NEX-5, and in many ways rivaled the NEX-7.  I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.  So far, the ISO performance has been very impressive.  It totally beats the pants off of my T1i in low light with no flash. That's not to say that there is no noise, but at ISO3200, I can capture very pleasant photos, which I've never really been able to do before. The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.  I don't feel like I am toting a bowling ball around.  The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.  I have taken to it pretty quick, and have also programmed the custom button settings to my liking.The kit lens seems on par to most kit lenses.  It does a decent job, and is good as a general use/walk around, but leaves you wanting more like a f2.8 zoom or 1.8 prime in creative situations. The include flash...is a flash. :)  It's direct only, and doesn't provide any bounce option.  It's fairly bright and acceptable for single person or a small group scenario.  I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.  I have also recently read that sony is making a hotshoe adapter to allow owners to use traditional SLR flash units, like my Canon 550EX.The adjustable live view screen works really well.  It allows for some creative shooting, without have to guess what the shot might come out like.  The \"auto\" mode actually works fairly well for general use, but you'll want to learn manual mode to create exactly what you want. I noticed that sometimes in auto mode, it would choose to not flash, and instead crank up ISO to 1600 or even 3200 for a shot.I have not yet experienced the clicking type sound that some earlier purchasers have experienced, but i'll try some different scenarios, and see if mine is ok.Overall, I am very happy with this camera,  It's light, it's fast, and it takes good photos (even when the light doesn't agree).

It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video. This is well documented and occurs if you move the camera at all during video shooting, you hear a loud clicking over your recorded audio during play back.Sony has been aware of this issue for SIX MONTHS and offers a return shipment to Texas where they will provide a \"performance enhancement\" to fix the problem.There is a page on Sonys support site with details about this.You call Sony, it's not an easy call or process if you can even understand the Sony support rep. They take your info, give you a list of instructions and then it takes them a day -  24 hours to simply email you a return shipping label. I called early yesterday and still no sign of mine.Sony takes 5-7 days to complete the repair and then returns it to you.Note that it ships GROUND both ways so your camera is out of service for a good few weeks. On a brand-new, expensive camera that Amazon continues to sell with the known defect.I read reports from people who did send it in for repair and found one here and on other sites stating the camera came back with glue on the display or was lost during the Sony repair process, and some had scratches on the body and display and other misalignments, damages to the body when the camera came back from repair. You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that. Sony offered no apology or interest whatsoever when we called and could not have cared less that we were having to send our brand new 5N in to fix a problem they've known about all this time.No thanks. Instead of continuing to sell these known defective units Amazon should stop and return them for the newer units in which Sony has fixed this issue since Sony is too sorry to recall the bad stock on their own. There are now plenty of complaints and documentation about this, why sell customers known defective cameras??!I returned my entire order and bought from a camera shop where I could test the newer unit camera first.So instead of an enjoyable day using my new Sony NEX 5 N we spent much of yesterday on the phone with Sony and eventually boxing everything back up and priting return labels for Amazon.

Fortunately my camera does not have this issue, but I was assured by the Sony rep that they track serial numbers so even if you buy a used camera you can still send it in and get it repaired for free.I see a lot of people buying big DSLR cameras just because they want better pictures. Unfortunately, I also see a lot of people return these cameras because they're too big/complicated/expensive. The NEX-5N solves all three of these problems by putting a high quality camera into a small and easy to use interface, and thanks to the new NEX 5R model, it can be picked up at a really great price.For people looking for a more sophisticated camera, the full manual settings, interchangeable lenses, and support of third party accessories (like waterproof cases and telescope adapters) provide almost limitless possibilities. I've used my camera to take some great shots of the night sky behind my house, and during the day I've snapped some incredible shots of birds in flight.The bottom line: You won't feel bad about buying a camera that's too complicated to use, and you won't feel like you're missing out on anything. If you want a camera you can use out of the box, and learn with if you choose to get more into photography then look no further.Is the NEX 5R worth it? Probably not.The NEX 5R has wifi built in. This allows it to run some apps, use a remote viewfinder, and wirelessly transfer photos from the camera. While this can be extremely useful for some people, it's new and therefore not fully developed. If I were in the market today, I'd buy the NEX 5N and a spare lens, and wait for a replacement to the NEX 5R and then buy the body only version of that.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amateur photographer friendly!", "Author": "Sofia Hernandez \"Lover, fighter, sister, moth...", "ReviewID": "R2BUS2G98SXTEQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.  That camera was a step up from a digital because of it's manual capabilities.  When the Sony came around I still wasn't confident enough even though it isn't a true DSLR.  With the Sony NEX-5N there are even more capabilities available to the amateur; at times rather daunting.  I have taken a very long time to write a review and I suspect that even now I will not be able to fully express all that this camera can accomplish under the proper hand.  This review will be very simplistic/basic in its terms because I am an amateur.  I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.  As well as nature and my Summer terrace garden.  If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.  Professionals may not, because they want the technical, which I am still trying to learn/master myself.The camera body itself is so light it is rather funny.  In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.  The heft increases as you add the lens and a viewfinder if necessary.  Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.  It is something to get used to though because you can no longer just stick it in your pocket or small purse.  With the 200mm lens it becomes a bit front-end heavy and collapses on its face.  The one thing that I absolutely adore is the 10fps.  My Nikon did not have that ability and it is such a picture saver when it comes to action scenes or the kids not sitting still.  Sony threw in the 55-210mm lens (grateful!), and it has saved me at the school plays and a Memorial Day NY Mets game.  I still find it rather difficult and cumbersome having to figure out which lens I am going to need for the day.  With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.  I would be able to sit on my terrace and zoom in across the street at the neighbors pear tree and actual pears.  I do see that these lenses are far better and truly stabilize on even the furthest zoom, where the aforementioned would have shake in the image.The camera is 95 percent menu driven and accessed by the touchscreen.  This becomes annoying at times.  It can take 5 steps or more to reach the desired location or certain function.  There is a selection wheel where your thumb grips the camera.  This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.  With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.  The touchscreen is large and all the info can be easily displayed if desired.  What I don't like is since the menus are only accessible via the touchscreen, it is a fingerprint, sweat and dirt magnet.  There are always stubborn streaks on the screen.  When we took the camera to the baseball game in field box seats on a 98 degree day, I couldn't see the screen no matter which angle.  I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.  There is not a viewfinder included; one can be purchased separately right here on Amazon for 274 dollars.  This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.  Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.  That is with recording for about 9 minutes and using 10fps option.  If travelling or needing to use the camera for extended periods, then I suggest purchasing a back-up battery pack.  I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.  No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.  I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.  The panoramic 3D works but I seem to have some issues with some of the baseball players missing limbs from the frame.  I suspect that it is indeed user error rather than the camera's fault.  I will upload the pics to Amazon's site as a reference.  Onto colors: It has been a joy shooting images where the colors pop out of the screen!  Depending on the shooting mode and style, you can have it that all the blues, yellow, greens or red pop and the rest of the image is black and white.  There are many different styles but I have never had that function and it has proven to be not only fun but useful.  I will attach those images as well.  We have not attached the flash so I cannot review its effectiveness.  There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!  What more could I want?!  I am finally able to capture images as they are seen by my naked eye.Shooting Full HD 1080P:  Shooting HD video is as simple as pressing the red button and you are there.  I have not experienced the loud sound or rattling that other users have.  We have recorded at noisy school functions and in our quiet bedroom.  Hopefully, we have an updated model and won't experience that issue.  There is no jittering, freezing or sync issues as I've experienced with the Nikon model.  I used a SDHC Class 10 16GB card and have had wonderful results.Highly recommend to any individual that wants to slowly step up to a DSLR.  If your point and shoot isn't doing it for you any longer, you want macros and if your budget allows then this would be a wonderful camera to practice on.  The image quality would not disappoint even the professional.  I can only imagine what a professional could accomplish.  IT is too expensive for not being a DSLR and every thing that is standard on other digital cameras needs to be purchased separately; down to the viewfinder.  A few months ago it was very difficult to find a case that fit this model perfectly.  I am hoping that it will be different now.  Finally, it's clunky... not like a true DSLR but something to get used to from your little cute point and shoot.  At the end of the day it will all be forgotten as you are awed by the images taken with your hands.

I waited for a couple months for the NEX 7, but am glad I stopped waiting.  While the 7 has a higher pixel count the 5N is far better in low light, and is significantly smaller and lighter. How many times do you really need over 16 Mega Pixels?  Also, the cost of the 5N is literally 50% less.  The 5N has been the IDEAL travel camera (we just returned from the BVI): pocketable with the 16mm and an after market 28mm Russian lens using the Leica M-39 adapter.  I HIGHLY recommend this camera, as well as the 18-55 lens, the 16mm and the fisheye adapter and an extra battery, as well as a large fast memory chip (64GB Komputer Bay class 10 works very well); and the extra audio adapter (but only if you plan to take advantage of the excellent 1080p video).  The bottom line: with many cameras available, this this the one I use constantly ...not to mention the rest of my family, who also have very nice fancy cameras of their own, but all prefer mine.PROS: Small, light weight, solid, high quality, reliable.  Best available ergonomics. Excellent features. Excellent sharpness, color saturation and low light performance. HDR built-in works well, but is better if you increase the range +- 4-6. The flash works surprisingly well- at close range, but be careful to remove lens \"sun-guards\" to avoid a possible small flash shadow effect(also sometimes need higher f-stop to avoid overexposure).  Feels fantastic in your hand. Nice display screen, with excellent display options.Cons: Nothing major- but it can always be better: \"Native\" E-Lens selection is still somewhat limited, although the only thing I really want that is missing now is a good light weight, lower f-stop fixed telephoto (100-200mm) that has the built-in auto focus & anti shake features (Available already with adapters).  Also know, that it will take some getting used-- to learn all the many, many features available, especially if this is your first Sony NEX. --Practice, and get a good guide book.Update: 2013 Jan.

Gitzlaff", "ReviewID": "R3SBLZ3EUY325J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without extensively recapitulating the very detailed positive reviews already on this camera (you should read, for instance, the review by Amazon's photographic affiliate DPReview), I'll say I am extremely impressed with this camera.  For several years, I've used a pro camera (Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens) and when it was too much of a hassle to lug all that gear around an enthusiasts' compact with lots of manual controls (Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD).  This is my first \"tweener\" mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, and it shows a lot of good design decisions.  I am going to enjoy very much using this camera for a long time.Fit and finish are impeccable, solidly built with no signs of cheap materials or assembly anywhere.  Medium size and weight - bigger than most compact point and shoot cameras, but smaller than an SLR.  The body alone is quite svelte, but the kit 18-55 mm lens adds a lot to its perceived size and weight.  In use, the kit is very comfortable in my hand, with good balance and sensible locations for the controls.  I also have the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 Lens for Sony NEX Cameras (which, funnily enough, looks like a small insulated coffee mug when detached and sitting on a table).  With the kit 18-55 mm lens (or smaller) attached, you can slide the NEX-5N into a jacket pocket.  With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS Lens (Silver), you're probably going to need to hang it on your shoulder or use a camera case.The rear articulated touch screen is superb.  I don't care for cameras where every function is controlled by a touchscreen (e.g., the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX55 16.2 MP Slim Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.3-Inch OLED touch screen (Black), which is a fine micro-camera but a little dodgy to control because of the way that touchscreen occupies almost the entire back surface of the camera).  I like cameras with physical buttons, wheels and switches because even though they can look difficult at first, once you figure them out you can operate the camera by feel in the dark and/or in daylight but without plastering your eyes to the rear viewscreen the entire time.  The NEX-5N overcomes these problems by including a control wheel and several physical buttons that change function depending on current shooting mode.  For instance, when you're in aperture priority mode, the wheel allows you select an aperture.  In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.  And so on.  Elegant and reasonably convenient to access most common functions, and after one gets used it you are free to compose photos without staring at the screen.  Other functions do require use of the menu system, but I think it is a good tradeoff for operational simplicity.The enclosed 18-55 mm lens (1.5 crop factor means 27-82.5 mm equivalent) covers a decent range for normal purposes.  In practice, I've found that the lens is reasonably responsive and produces better photos that I might have expected of a kit lens. At wide angles, there is a certain amount of barrel distortion, but it's mostly visible only in architectural photos with lots of straight lines and right angles & can be corrected easily enough using programs like Aperture, Lightroom or PTLens.  All of the Sony-designed lenses use 49 mm filters, which is kind of an odd size but cheaper than the larger filters common on SLRs.  If you are interested in outdoor and landscape shots, at a minimum you should consider buying a decent circular polarizer, maybe the Marumi 49mm 49 Super DHG MC CPL PL.D Slim Thin Filter Japan or B+W 49mm Circular Polarizer with Multi-Resistant Coating.The final thing I'll say is that unlike its predecessor the NEX-5, the NEX-5N has terrific low-light sensitivity, equal to or better than any non-full-frame pro-SLR manufactured as little as 1-2 years ago, with surprisingly usable high-ISO settings that are natively low-noise and can be further massaged with normal posprocessing software.  This sensitivity means you can shoot without flash much of the time, even indoors and in low light.  That's good, because the included mini-flash gets the job done better than I might have expected, but attaching and detaching it is kind of dodgy with a fiddly little thumb wheel that is half blocked by the flash itself and the camera's protective port cover.  A mini hot shoe or hot shoe adapter would have been a better design choice.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "R1XSQ032RT7AG7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a large dslr camera, and bought the NEX 5n to have as a second camera.  We frequently get together with friends and go to dinner, and I don't like to use a flash in a restaurant.

This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the \"clicking sound\" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.  You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.  This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.  If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.  The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worried before, Happy after, No video click issue found on mine.", "Author": "TX Piano Guy", "ReviewID": "RGUSKHS3NIERC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.

My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my \"repaired\" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.

I respond with information about lens used and what I have noticed as well as a link to a video that exhibits the problem.The next day notice a missed call but no voicemail.

I am told the person that emailed me is out of the office for X amount of time and that a new Tech would contact me. Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back. I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech. I explain that he tried to call and left a message stating I should call back. The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call. The tech apparently is unaware of the issue as he immediately starts explaining that Sony has a Service Notice for the clicking. I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else. I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem. The Tech instructs me to hang up and respond with the links in an email he will send me. I get the email shortly after and respond with the links to the videos.Two days later and I do not receive a phone call nor an email response.

The 5n seems to be a little more particular about lighting though.Features >  List of features is nice like Panoramo, HDR and other effects.Manual Modes >  Camera gives you plenty of control.CONS..Clicking Sound >  Its well documented that the 5n has a clicking sound during video recording caused by an internal part moving around. Sony has offered a free update but even the info on their page states that  it REDUCES the noise. Apparently the fix involves placing grease or something on the part to dampen the noise ? This sounds temporary to me and as stated there is no guarantee it will fix the  issue completely. This is a big CON in my opinion since HD video is a very big feature of this camera and it was marketed as such.10 FPS >  Yes this sounds like a PRO but not when you only get about 10 shots before the buffer is full.The clicking sound ruins this camera for me.

Shin", "ReviewID": "R1BZS4MLWE31WK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the camera that replaced my Canon DSLR.I went on a trip to the Canadians Rockies a few months ago. The activities are all outdoors, whether hiking the mountains or the glacier. My Canon T3i (600D) with 18-135mm lens just became such a chore to carry. It was big and heavy (other DSLR owners are laughing at me right now).Fast forward 2 months, I am going to the London Olympics and I desperately wanted smaller and lighter and it basically came down to the two available choices: Micro 4/3 or Sony NEX. I almost went with M43 b/c of it's smaller size but ultimately the higher quality of the Sony sensor and its fantastic lowlight capability won out.I purchased the following:- NEX-5N w/ 18-55mm- 55-200mm lens- 16mm pancake, VCLECU1 wide angle converter, VCLECF1 fisheye converter- FDA-EV1S EVF- HVLF20S external flashEssentially, I had bought a complete NEX outfit. I was a bit nervous about my NEX purchase and taking it to London b/c it was untested and I really did not have much time to test it out. Furthermore, it doesn't have all the convenient buttons like my DSLR! However, once I got there, it turned out to be absolute gold.The NEX body is spectacularly thin and light. That's a huge plus. It's too bad Sony couldn't produce smaller lens like M43 but oh well... you are getting that bigger APS-C sensor. When they do finally engineer smaller lens, I'll upgrade. For now, what I have are fine. What I appreciated the most is that I can hang the NEX around my neck with the kit zoom or 16mm pancake and not feel like I have whiplash.Plus, regarding the lack of buttons - what it has is fine. You can program certain buttons and it served my needs. I'm not a pro photographer. When I take pics, I just simply want instant access to ISO and EV along with your usual aperture/shutter control. 90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter. With NEX-5n, EV is already available as the down direction of the dial and I was able to program ISO as the right direction.  With the bottom button, I programmed to access HDR. This was my first camera with HDR (T3i doesn't have it) and it makes a HUGE difference. The contrast outside, especially between shaded and sunlit areas, is a huge improvement to without HDR. I do wish the HDR processing time was quicker however. It takes 8 seconds for the camera to process and combine the 3 snaps into one. That's too long and really makes it useless when you need to be snapping multiple shots. Note - it's important to take HDR photos when you don't have subjects moving (like people walking everywhere) since it essentially takes 3 snaps and combines it into one. It's an awesome sound though - \"snap snap snap\" within a blink of an eye.The APS-C sensor, though now over a year old - is still fantastic. It eats darkness for breakfast. In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action. Even at 1600, the images were surprisingly clear. I really didn't need to push it to 3200 or even 6400 though I could have.I ended up not using the touchscreen. I disabled it after too many accidental changes to settings. I didn't miss it however.-The EVF - this is a MUST. If you purchase NEX-5n, you MUST get this, no questions! Without it, you'll end up using NEX like a P&S.; Besides being able to brace the camera against your body, there's something to be said about bringing the camera up to your eye and snapping away.-The 18-55 lens turned out to be very useful snapping away around town.-The 55-200 was essentially all I used while at the Olympic events b/c I had nosebleed seats in most. It's just a bit too long and heavy... hopefully a more compact iteration will be out soon.-16mm pancake turned out to be an absolute winner when walking down the busy Portobello Rd in Notting Hill. I had the VCLECU1 wide angle on it and I'd take snaps with or without at will (if too wide, I'd simply take it off, hold it in my left hand, take the pic, and then put it back on). The pancake and the wide angle converter were absolute winners.  I did not use the fisheye so much. It's a cool effect but I found the wide angle converter to be much more practical. At $100-110 a pop, the wide angle converter and fish eye are no brainers. If going with one, I'd get the wide angle.-External flash - never once did I use it due to the great low-light capable sensor.Edit 9/2012: I went to a Sci-fi/anime convention recently where all the action was held inside various hotels, indoors. This means lighting is a challenge, even with the sensitive sensor of NEX-5n. I used the flash indoors all weekend and it is truly a great accessory. While it's a lot smaller than DSLR flashes (like Canon Speedlite), it's also much lighter and cheaper. The unit only cost me around $130. I consider this a bargain compared to $400 you must spend for the bigger DSLR flash units. However the performance was excellent. There is a built in tilt function which is great if you have a ceiling to bounce the light. The photos of people in costumes were very natural, without the usual harshness of directly firing at the subject. I did tone down the flash by -1.0 to -1.7 b/c it did seem a little too powerful. Where there wasn't a ceiling, like hotel lobbies, I still used bounce for softer lighting, and the results were pleasing, though not as good as if you were truly bouncing light. Bounce flash even in portrait-oriented shots were surprisingly good (note, there's no swivel).  The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad. I carry 3 batteries total so running out of juice has not been an issue. One negative is that if you use flash, you cannot use EVF. So I spent the entire weekend without the EVF that I dearly love and then found that you can survive without the EVF... your NEX feels like a big P&S.; It's not a bad thing however. At the end of the day, does it take amazing quality photos? Yes. That's all that counts.Side note:When I take a trip, it's important to have a \"good\" camera (DSLR equivalent) and a good P&S; so you can snap away on a whim or ask others to take photos of you. You can't just give some random person on the streets your NEX or DSLR. It's just too much to ask. Instead, just hand them the compact P&S.; My P&S; is Nikon P310. Naturally, I had considered others like Canon S100 but for the price I paid, it was a clear win. In actual practice, the photos came out great - colors were natural, the metering was spot on in most cases, low light capability was phenomenal, and the bottom line is that it's easy for anyone off the street to use.I cannot wait for the successor to NEX-5n.[Update 11/2012]: The successor is NEX-5R.

I loved it, but didn't love its size and weight, nor did I love having to often use a tripod (for situations in which the NEX-5n doesn't require one).However the DSC-R1 remains the preferred camera when quiet is a requirement, or when I need to 'sneak up' on a subject and photograph a camera-shy subject without looking at them.  The LCD screen on the R1 will swivel a full 360 degrees!  And of course the shutter is almost completely inaudible, so no one is aware a photo was taken.But the NEX-5N sounds like the SLRs that spawned it--the kuh-lunk of its shutter is a dead giveaway to subjects that they've been snapped.  This is why--despite the NEX's diminutive size, interchangeable lenses, stabilization, HDR, and other features--I haven't sold the R1.But the photo I described earler?  I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.  Oh wow.  I am able to take excellent 1080p video with decent stereo sound and still have (as others have mentioned) all that in just one device.  Now I'm looking for video editing software with the knowledge that this will deliver raw footage I won't need to be ashamed of on high-definition screens.Summing up, finally I'm able to get the pictures I envision when I compose them.  My father was an excellent golfer who played golf from his pre-teens into his later years without a hole-in-one until he was over sixty.  Photographically speaking I feel like I'm hitting holes-in-one pretty often these days.  It's the NEX-5N that's made it possible.UPDATE 12/27/2012This camera continues to impress with sharp photos with the kit lens and the tele-zoom (Sony E-mount 55-210mm).At times it seems to be underexposing slightly, perhaps 1/3 F-Stop less than I thought I was getting. However none of those exposures were unusable, and all still had good shadow detail despite the apparent underexposure.Thus far I have had absolutely none of the clicking sounds during video that some folks described having with earlier iterations of the NEX-5N. The videos are excellent, with good stabilization and decent sound. But friends who have seen the videos are impressed with the sharpness and quality, and have even commented on the relatively low amount of camera shake at high telephoto magnification.The only negative I have experienced is some binding of the kit zoom lens at the outer end of the zoom ratio (40mm to 55mm). I am seriously considering sending it back to Sony, but fear I will not only miss having the lens to use while it is being examined under warranty, but that Sony may simply glance at it and send it back un-repaired. While I believe in Sony's ability to design great products, I am not impressed with their warranty service and  tech support. Sony needs to learn from Amazon:  When you allow product returns and exchanges, you actually enhance sales of product. If Sony would re-commit to being a consumer-oriented service organization and not only a product manufacturer, it might see a resurgence of consumer loyalty, along with a company turnaround.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best value and quality for $650", "Author": "DoctorWho", "ReviewID": "R39PXA6SLZ706C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is no competition for this camera as of today.

It's also easy to just pic AUTO and let the camera decide - puts a lot of power in the hands of people who are interested in gradually expanding their knowledge beyond a P&S.; I've taken it out several times and am simply amazed at the quality of the shots that are coming out of it. I especially like the Panorama option. You can literally pick folks out of the crowd on the other side of an arena. Wow.Downside:  I wish there were more lenses available for this, and faster ones too. In particular, I'd love to have a wide lens - 11mm or so - for REAL pano shots. I also wish that the electronic viewfinder option wasn't another 60% of the cost of the camera - seems a little outrageous to me, and I haven't sprung for one yet because of that.Also, after shooting P&S; and DSLRs, it's weird to have to manually zoom a lens while looking at a screen, instead of just pressing a button. Kind of intersects both worlds. Just sayin'.  ;)I've heard from some other pros that they are purchasing this camera as a backup to their DSLR rigs for the same reasons that took me to it, and are having equally great results. This is a fabulous street photography camera - its size makes it unobtrusive and non-intimidating. The camera is also a great choice for an amateur looking to move to the next level - it's the first non-DSLR that I would say this about. Before, I'd recommend a DSLR. The Sony NEX-5n is that good.This camera is the FIRST of the next generation of mirrorless cameras with DSLR sensors (APS-C in this case), and heralds a potential shift in the photographic market place, where the traditional photography companies will focus more on optics and semiconductor/chip makers and designers will produce bodies (look for Samsung to eventually do something very interesting here).

Build quality is excellent. That wasn't a surprise. And, I knew that it was capable of producing excellent photos. My concerns had more to with the NEX system's lack of high quality lenses and how much I would like the mostly touch screen interface.As to the interface, that's part of the pleasant surprise. I'm not sure that a few years ago I would have taken to it quite as well. Thank Apple and the iPhone for educating me on the advantages and ease of screen based controls. With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access. The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out. As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos. Just to try the camera out, I shot an afternoon letting the camera make those decisions for me. In normal lighting situations, it did a great job, quite consistently. Subsequent experiments have shown me that I can actually trust the camera enough to leave it on IA for quick snapshots. I would never have imagined that possible. When the light gets dim, I switch back to aperture priority and control the ISO settings. The intelligent auto setting doesn't understand tripods.Low light is another area where I've been pleased. I normally think of most cameras special modes as marketing gimmicks, or toys that people play with for a while then forget. The NEX's hand held night function actually works very well, allowing me to take a number of indoor photos in low light that came out great. The hand held HDR function is also something that I'll use occasionally in high contrast lighting.My biggest problem in choosing a NEX camera has been the lack of small, light, high-quality lenses. That's still a concern for me. I'm okay with the kit lens. It's quite good for what it is. But it does have its limits. Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system (Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965), I wasn't interested in the system. That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking. It matches this small and light camera with a small and light lens that is sharp and has a decently large aperture at F/2.8. That makes the NEX-5N into a very good street photography camera.That's a lot of rambling to say that this is a good camera for experienced photographers, within limits. It's not a replacement for your DSLR. It is a good street/travel camera. Some more small prime lenses would help us a lot. For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera. The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system. And the camera has what appears to be a pretty good built in help system.P.S. Two extras made my experience with the camera better. I've already mentioned the Sigma 30mm lens. There's an Arca Swiss compatible tripod plate made by SunwayFoto (check eBay) that's specifically designed for the 5N. The quality is good.

I have a Canon T2i and find the sharpness to be on a par with that. Very nice to have that in a such a compact package. The video quality is very close to my Panasonic tm700 which shoots 1080/60p and is absolutely amazingly lifelike. The tm700 has a better stabalizer, not much, and focuses faster, again minor but noticeable. There are effects in fully auto mode that I love. Great fun and simple to apply. The scenes are also very quick and useful for special conditions.Here's what I don't like. I was taking a video of a friend and noticed that the skin tone was over saturated with red. It looked like a sunburn. This was in an office with artificial lighting. I've also noticed it at home or anywhere there's not a particularly bright light source. The other seeming defect is that I've noticed spots in the frame when the background, also indoors, is tan/orange/yellow. The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200. The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots. The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome. I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed. Examples can be found on Flickr if you search for tags nex-5n spots. This could be just my camera, I don't know of course. I've just noticed it. It's not dust.I will post any updates. I've not yet contacted Sony customer service but will.as of 3/20/2012I've upgraded the firmware to 1.01, verified it, and retaken some shots of tan walls to see if spots persisted and they do. They're very faint though. This is still a superb camera and I don't hesitate to use it in any lighting situation. Five stars if for perfect though so that stays but disappointed is overstating it.Thanks for the response on the firmware update. I feel better having done that. The spots still quite possibly could be removed with a thorough cleaning. I used the setup cleaning mode to no effect and I've only used it in pristine condition and for only a month so we'll see.as of 3/30/2012I purchased a cleaning kit for the sensor and was able after 20 or so passes with the various pads and wipes to remove all the spots. It's a bit unnerving because you think, at least a novice like myself, that too hard and you'll destroy the filter or sensor, not enough and it'll never be perfect. I do not for the life of me know how such indelible stains, not dust, got on there. I only changed lenses indoors. I'll continue to monitor it and see if this mirrorless type of camera just attracts debris more readily.Other than that it's been a great camera. The images and video are stunning.as of 4/1/2012New spots have appeared on the sensor. They show up noticeably on sky blue background. I change lenses infrequently and only indoors so every few days cleaning is not an option. I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens. Just not worth it given the delicate and dangerous job of cleaning the sensor.as of 4/5/2012Amazon kindly sent me a replacement for which I'm grateful as I was beyond the 30 day window. I unboxed it, attached a lens and tried the 2 settings (iso 3200 on a light background and then 1 second exposure on blue sky) that revealed the sensor spots I've had an issue with and similar spots appeared on this camera too. Right out of the box. As far as I can see I'm the only one complaining and I still gravitate to this camera every day. Love the images and the size.

The high ISO images were practically noiseless,crisp and clear and better than any other camera I have ever used.Unfortunately, the menu system needs a lot of help. It is long, complicated (for me at least) and difficult to read with my tired old eyes. The fonts are very tiny.  There is a provision for making them larger but only minimally.The camera is very small but still not pocketable so I wonder where the advantage of size is supposed to be.I missed the long zoom of my point and shoot.The LCD is only partially articulated and not nearly as convenient as one that swings out to the side and allows for self portraits. This one articulates only in an up and down fashion. No self portraits here.The screen brightness is pretty dim in sunlight unless you opt for a \"sunny weather\" setting which then becomes way too bright when you are inside.  A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty \"wobbly.\"  I did not hear any \"clicking\" on the videos with this particular unit.The specs say the battery should last for 400+ shots.  I found this was not the case.  I fiddled with the menus and took about 100 pictures and the battery retained less than about 30% of capacity.All in all, I was sorely tempted to keep this camera only for the superb images it produced but it would be silly for me to have one camera for \"good\" pictures and another camera for \"features.\" I may as well lug around a DSLR with two lenses, which defeats the purpose of having a single camera to carry around.

Also, I'm using video a lot more now than I ever did with previous cameras - this camera has very well focused and exposed video.I have customized the \"soft keys\" or buttons (Look under \"Settings - Custom Key Settings\").

I have the buttons set :A>  bottom button (in Auto the Help key) :  Focusing areaB>  center-of-ring button (in Auto the Mode selector ) can choose three things:  Metering area / WB / D-rangeC>  right click on ring (in Auto the Live selector) :  ISOORIGINAL REVIEW :-----------------------------------------Indoor no-flash, the Sony NEX 5N is pretty much a game changer. Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above. For instance, I wouldn't let my nice Lumix LX5 go above ISO 800 indoors. Now, using the NEX 5N Auto mode indoors will often result in ISO 1600 or even 3200, and there's no problem : the APS-C sensor, and the processor's programming gives me 800 performance at ISO 3200. I then have the faster shutter speed available, to help stop the blur of most kid and pet movements.How did I come to choose the NEX 5N ??  Well, I am retired, and I spent a LOT of time on forums for Sony, Panasonic, Canon, etc... But I especially played a lot with dpReview's \"High ISO comparison\" tool:One day I put the Canon G15 against the Nikon P7700 and the Lumix LX7. For the fourth and final unit, I happened to choose the Samsung NX1000, because I had seen it on a big sale at Amazon. The Samsung with its APS-C sensor was so superior, that I began to look for other cams that used the same type sensor. DpReview had the NEX-5N rated at 79, so I put it on my list to play with. The NEX simply blew everyone's socks off, including in later comparisons the Micro 4/3's from Nikon and Olympus. I watched Amazon for several weeks, and in mid-November I was lucky to find the 5N at $100 less than the small Sony RX100 and that Samsung NX1000, which had been my two top choices up to that time.The NEX-5N also has near-excellent video. There is no \"clicking sound\" that early buyers sometimes mentioned, but once in a while there is a background motor noise during quiet periods of recording.Something else I really like: the 5N has a quieter shutter than any DSLR. All DSLRs are noisy beasts in comparison, very good for calling attention to themselves at the wrong time. The NEX-5N is of course still louder than a compact, but if you set the \"Front Curtain Shutter\" option to \"enabled\", the sound is very much reduced.Some reviews say the included 18-55 kit lens is only Very Good, not great; mine has no noticeable problems, and I've become a lot more critical than I once was. In tests side by side, the NEX slightly outdid my Pentax K-30 and K-01 kit lenses for sharpness in most every type of scene. Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting \"Camera - AF/MF - DMF\".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10\" away with this lens to focus. By cropping, you will get a great photo, since the NEX is so sharp and noiseless at low ISO.UPDATE 1-25 : Tried the Sony dedicated 30mm macro lens. It was a very good lens for macro and for general use as well, but I decided Sony's 16mm Pancake lens was better for me, as it makes the camera actually pocketable in a loose jacket or winter coat. With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no \"DSLR intimidation\" and frown.... Even with the kit zoom, most people react well if you are open and polite.CONCLUSION:============A./ This camera far exceeds premium compacts and the micro 4/3rds for ISO performance. With the kit zoom, it is larger and needs a strap rather than a pocket. You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./ Compared to any DSLR under $1200, the 5N is their photographic equal, and 50% lighter to carry. Put a protective UV filter on, and you're good to go street shooting out of the box.C./ However, the 5N is not a replacement for an advanced photographer using a DSLR in the field, where frequent ISO , WB, Focus Point, HDR, and other setting changes have to be made on-the-fly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have a winner here in the form of the NEX 5N, people.

After doing a fair amount of research, I decided to buy the 5n due to a variety of stellar reviews and the hard to beat new price. I recently went on a two week vacation in Europe and used both this camera and my previous camera, a Lumix Lx3.THE GOOD:WOW. The image quality of the 5n is amazing. The color saturation is incredible even at high ISOs. And the metering is fairly spot on in most situations. It handles complex lighting situations very well, generally getting a well balanced exposure. For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky. The Lx3 on the other hand, will only be able to handle one or the other, with the sky being blown out in most situations (keep in mind the Lx3 has a much smaller sensor and is from 2008; still, it is a very good camera at iso100). Contrast is also excellent and objects in the foreground feel closer than objects in the background. In comparison, the Lx3 tends to feel a bit flat overall.ISO is usable up to 6400, after which it gets chunky and crummy. Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read. Still, in this regard the Lx3 is better. The Lx3 is just a little bit sharper and that makes a difference. Also, I found that I didn't like the distortion on the widest setting with the 5n and much prefer the Lx3's widest setting. In addition, the kit lens is pretty slow. Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light. Not great, but pretty good. And the fact that it moves aprox. 90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate. I found using the manual controls more intuitive than the touch controls, but to each his own.The size of the camera with the kit lens verges on being too big, but manages to still feel compact enough. My wife was able to fit the camera into a fairly small purse. Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good. The camera captures what you see very well. However, when I look online at some shot comparisons of an outdoor scene with one of the Olympus PENs (don't remember if it was the 2 or the 3) the Olympus just looked better, though it was clear that the Olympus was not color accurate. On the other hand, the PEN series seems to have horrible grain at higher ISOs, so this immediately took the PEN out of the running for me. Anyway, I haven't tried any of the other color settings on the 5n, so this is more of a thinking-out-loud comment than any real statement. In general, I think color accuracy wins the day.THE BAD:Ugh. There is no in-camera anti-shake. And this takes a lot of getting used to. I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else. Major whiff on the part of Sony and basically keeps this camera from being truly great. There are pictures that you'll take that you will think are in focus by viewing the monitor that will be ruined by motion blur upon viewing on your home computer. Basically, until you learn how to compensate for the lack of anti-shake, it is a must to zoom into the photo to ensure that it isn't blurry (on the playback screen). In a dark setting, I can take a photo with the Lx3 at 1/15 with little worry of motion blur. But with the Sony it a crap-shoot.The shutter is extremely loud.The camera takes a bit too long to start up. This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good. And it is especially bad in low light, even though the red light emanating from the camera is extremely bright.If you order the black 5n, the lens that comes with it will be silver and not black to match the body.I didn't really use the flash, so no word on its function. But the color of the flash is a sort of grey-silver, and it doesn't match the silver on the lens. So if you care about the aesthetics of a thing, then a black body with a silver lens with a grey flash starts to look a bit like Frankenstein's monster.Camera strap is adequate but a bit on the cheap side.No camera case is included.The menu system and camera controls are not very intuitive. I've read that they are much better with the newer 5r. But in comparison to the Lumix, where you can switch aspect ratios manually, switch shooting modes manually, and in general access everything you want a little easier, the Sony really loses in this area.It is somehow easy to accidentally adjust the settings on the camera to under-expose (exposure compensation). I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1APVRZVMDXQOQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012. I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video! And I am sad to say but I too am a victim of the clicking noises. However, I will admit that it takes great pictures. I am returning and trying my luck with a second one... I give Sony 2 stars for continuing to sell these bad batches and also for letting this type of basic usability issue pass their QC process.UPDATE - Amazon delivered my replacement NEX-5N on 10/19/2012 but that too was clicking. So when I asked for a 3rd replacement they said the policy is 2 tries then refund so I'll be returning both after all. Sony is currently selling this camera for 499 plus tax (no where near as good as the current Amazon price) but I'll try my luck there since I do like the camera.P.S. I was at my local Best Buy yesterday and held one of their demo's to my ear and shook it a bit and clearly heard the rattling noise so I guess there's a lot of these bad ones out there:(.Final UPDATE 10/24/2012 - I came home with my 3rd NEX-5N, this time from the SONY store and it had the same clicking issue!! I tried all three side by side and realized my first one from Amazon clicked considerably less than the other two (though obviously not perfect since it put me through all this adventure).So based on my personal experience temporarily owning 3 NEX-5Ns AND playing with one at Best Buy, I hesitate to believe that there are actually models out there with zero video recording issues. My conclusion is that the noise is likely not as pronounced in some models or some buyers may not be as concerned because they love the good quality pics it takes.I myself am leaning more towards keeping the 1st NEX-5N from Amazon since the camera seems to work well and I likely won't record videos as much.

Just an easy to understand review for the other amateur shooters out there. I've had a couple of DSLR's in the past 7 years and that is all I've shot with. Have been wanting something smaller that could produce equal quality images. I'm coming from a D90, which is not a very big camera to begin with, but this Nex 5n is such a great traveler for the difference in weight alone. If you walk around town with a full size DSLR slung over your shoulder you will begin to get fatigued. I don't even notice I'm carrying this little guy. So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens. Threw on a filter for each and went to shooting on a recent vacation. I couldn't believe the quality of pics I got. Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted. A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics. The intelligent auto is great. Always gets it right. Even in dark situations I've been able to capture excellent lighting by using the layer mode. --- takes several pictures and smooths them out into 1 image. It's such a cool feature I found myself using it a lot.Bottom line, this camera is packed with features. I don't care about the video feature, but it works well. This was not an impulse buy. However, if it had been, I would have kept the camera anyway. Now my D90 is just sitting in the closet getting lonely. I'll still use it in the future, but I'm having fun with this camera. I notice a lot of people getting their first DSLR for one reason or another. I think that it's worth considering a camera like this if you are not a professional. This will give most people all the image quality they will ever need and then some. The ILC type cameras just seem to be a new technology that a lot of people don't know about so they aren't considering them. I'll say it again, give these some serious thought if you aren't a pro. Much easier to carry around and they don't look like a big target for a thief if you are out in the streets. Only downfall is the live view LCD doesn't let the battery last as long as a DSLR.

Groh", "ReviewID": "R2UBPXPU6AGRYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, I have to say I was both excited and nervous about trying out this camera. Being an amateur photographer for over 30 years, I've gone from point and shots to old SLRs with interchangeable lenses and tons of manual settings, to digital cameras of many types. My Canon G10 has been wonderful in so many ways but the temptation to have a camera reminiscent of my old film-based SLR was exiting.So, there I was at my dad's for the weekend. He was always a much better technical photographer than I was and understood lighting, F-stops and shutter speeds more than me. He began by reading the manual and exclaiming over and over, \"Wow, this has amazing features!\" This has so much technology built into the programming and we were excited to try it out.So, we played around with settings and located dials and buttons and then ventured outside to his beautiful garden in the woods. We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 Lens for Sony NEX Cameras. These were our findings:The body is small and thin, amazing when you consider the kind of technology built in to the brain. But even the smaller lens adds a lot of bulk. It is not a 'slip in your carry bag for family vacations' kind of small. If you are bringing it along, you have to make the commitment that you'll be carrying a larger camera bag.Like most good cameras, the battery is rechargeable. The camera uses a standard memory card.Swapping out lenses is really simple, just a button release and a careful twist. Lenses line up with coded dots and click into place with a satisfying sound.The camera did a great job on auto, focusing quickly, balancing colors and exposure and taking a very nice \"snapshot.\" You can zoom in and out using the lens (not an on the body zoom) bringing back memories of making subjects freeze while I zoomed in and manually focused on my old cameras.Some of the features include 'smile detection'. So we changed it to that setting and spent awhile trying to make faces while partially pressing the shutter. If I pushed all the way it took a picture no matter what the facial expression. The instructions are not very clear in how to use the smile detection setting so I have to say that was a minor disappointment.Another feature is that it will focus on a subject and blur out the background. Sometimes we experienced that it had trouble deciding what to focus on, even if the subject (a flower or plant) was in the center of the screen.The touchscreen was nice but not having a traditional viewfinder was frustrating at times, especially in bright outdoor shots when the screen was difficult to see. It's unfortunate that the optional viewfinder is a rather expensive investment at $348 and it takes up the flash location when in use.The flash is removable and has numerous positions for fill, bounce or direct lighting. I was happy to see that the flash did a great job of not washing out the subject when used up close.There are so many features that are detailed in the product description that there is no point in rehashing them and I'm sure my uneducated voice would botch the terminology as well.Overall, this is a beautiful camera, a huge step above a standard point and shoot, compact enough for high end photography, but a little too big for pocket sized family vacation shots.I'm very pleased with the quality and detail in the photographs and the possibilities I'll keep unraveling as I take more photos with this extraordinary piece of equipment.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Powerful, fast, and compact with excellent results", "Author": "Lee T.", "ReviewID": "R2YBLTYUTGCUMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TL;DR: This is a great camera that is capable of taking excellent photos while being very portable and very well priced.I have owned this camera since September 2011 and I own the 16mm f2.8 as well as the kit lens. I'm planning on picking up the 50mm f1.8 as soon as it comes into stock.My previous cameras have all been point and shoots, so I can mostly compare it to those types of cameras (as opposed to DSLRs). If you're used to using point and shoots, even enthusiast models, the quality difference will be very dramatic. The larger sensor in NEX-5N allows for greater dynamic range, superior noise performance, and more control over depth of field. Interchangeable lenses allow for more versatility, higher quality, and larger apertures (though not necessarily all at the same time). All of that quality is available in a relatively small package, though it should be noted that point and shoots will still be smaller. Micro Four Thirds cameras such as the Panasonic GF3 and Olympus E-PL3 will also usually be smaller with lenses attached, but not by much.The NEX-5N body is very comfortable to hold and fits nicely in the hand. I recommend using a wrist strap instead of the shoulder strap it comes with. The buttons are very customizable, though I wouldn't have minded a slightly larger body with more external controls. With customization, most of the functions I change often are very easy to access (ISO, exposure compensation, white balance, AF/MF, AF mode, AF area, metering mode). The touchscreen helps with control to a certain extent, though you have to be careful not to touch in when you don't intend to.Autofocus is very quick, though not quite as fast as the latest Micro Four Thirds bodies. The shutter lag is essentially non-existent at 20 ms, meaning that there is no perceptible delay between pressing the shutter release and hearing that satisfying (and relatively quiet) click. For manual focusing, the focus-by-wire system present on the e-mount lenses feels somewhat disconnected but is very precise. Focus peaking makes manual focusing very easy, and can be combined with zooming for a very nice and unique experience.As I mentioned earlier, the sensor produces very high quality pictures with excellent dynamic range and great looking colors out of the box. ISO performance holds up to 100% on screen inspection up to ISO 6400, though the auto ISO only goes up to ISO 3200. It would be good if the auto ISO was customizable, and maybe it will be in a future firmware update. Auto WB balance can sometimes get confused with indoor lighting, but generally does well. For high speed shooting, 10 fps is easily professional level, though the buffer size could be larger. The 10 fps shooting speed allows for very nice features like sweep panorama and hand held twilight.The camera can do 1080p60 video, which looks great but eats up SD cards quickly. The lenses all have quiet enough focus motors that AF noise doesn't really enter into videos. The audio quality is pretty good, but I haven't had a chance to try out the add on microphone. Even video taken in low light can look good. The record button is convenient, but also easy to press accidentally. It would be nice to be able to disable it or reassign it when you know you won't want to record video any time soon.Sony needs to expand the system with more e-mount lenses, so if you're looking to buy into a system that has a wide selection  available right now then Micro Four Thirds or a traditional DSLR will serve you better. Given enough time, the system will be more filled out. It should be noted that e-mount lenses are very well priced when compared to other systems. Adapted lenses apparently do better as well because of the APS-C sized sensor, though I haven't had a chance to try any.I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a DSLR-sized sensor in a small package.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Upgrade from Point & Shoot", "Author": "Anthony Lawson", "ReviewID": "RWP0TWU74MAN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Alpha Nex-5n exists in a realm somewhere between a petite point & shoot and a big & chunky DSLR. There isn't much I can say about this camera that hasn't already been said in other reviews both here and on professional sites and blogs. That said, if you are interested in stepping up from a point & shoot but don't want to make the personal investment of learning the ins and outs of a DSLR (and don't want to lug a huge camera around), you can hardly go wrong with this shooter. It's easy to use and takes beautiful photos, even on the automatic setting. Full manual control is available if you're up to the task, or are just that persnickety. A big selling point of the Alpha Nex series is the interchangeable e-mount lenses, but if you have no interest in such things do know that the included 18-55mm lens is suitable for most shots.I only have 2 complaints with regards to this camera. The first being that at higher ISO levels in low light there is a fair deal of noise. That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera. My second complaint is that my unit has a dead pixel smack dab in the middle of the rear LCD panel. It took me a few days to notice it, but now that I have, I cannot unnotice it. It is rather distracting. Dead pixels in LCD panels are a fact of life, and 1 dead pixel on a screen is well within acceptable QA limits, and would not be considered a defect. Neither of these issues are enough for me to dock a star. This is, hands down, the best camera I've ever owned.

He immediately emailed me a shipping label. I was also told to send only the body back (well packed to avoid damage in transit) along with a copy of the shipping label in the box, nothing else 'please' and to make sure that the box had no old shipping labels.They send me email updates when they received the camera and when they shipped it back. I got the camera back after 8 business days, they also included a spare battery (it did not appear to be a mistake on their part, since they included it in the repair list as a no charge item); thank you Sony for that - its better than a 'sorry for the inconvenience' note. The 'upgrade' seems to work, so far I have not had any more issues but I still suspect that it is a software problem since the sound is exactly the same as that produced when you use the control buttons. I have no idea what they 'upgraded' but so far the problem is gone. I don't use the video a lot, but its nice to know that I can rely on the camera not to add annoying clicks on the video.----I have been looking to upgrade my P&S; for about a year now. I have a Minolta 8000i film SLR and had it for the last two decades; I sent an arm and a leg for it (flash,lenses, tripod..) and it still takes great pictures, I think. For about 10 years I have been using a digital P&S; as a second camera that I carry around. I always thought I was an SLR toting amateur, but in reality I have used the SLR very little in the last decade. Its too big to carry around all the time. I always carry my P&S; and that's so what I use almost all the time.At first I bought cheap P&S;, after all it wasn't my real camera, and upgraded every couple of years. Recently, I have seen more and more of my friends upgrade to DSLR; but that was not for me. I am not going to carry a bulky DSLR, and anyway, the quality of my Panasonic P&S; pics were fair enough - well, mostly. The blow came when my wife said about a year ago \"you do realize that you are not the best photographer any more\" and went on to say \"don't buy any more small cameras, the pictures aren't very good.\" Well that's Facebook for you.After obsessing for almost a year, I was still not sure what to buy. Trying just about every camera, I could not find anything I really liked. I had to be small, good, and under $2000; although I really wanted to spend under $1500. The 4/3 are small, good at most things except low light high ISO, and that's a deal killer for me. The nearest thing was the NEX 5, but it really was inferior to a big DSLR like Nikon D7000 or Sony A580 in pretty much in every way except size. The Sony A55 was perhaps good enough, fast auto-focus even in video, good images, but much too big; I wanted a NEX 5 but with the quality of a A580. I really want really good image quality (IQ) in low light (high ISO).Note: The Nikon's (D5100, D7000) were perhaps a little better than the Sony, but I have a couple of good Minolta lenses that can be used on a Sony A series; and anyway the Sony is much better at video.When the NEX C3 came out I thought I was ready to buy. It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough. Although I did not expect the replacement for NEX 5 to be much better than the C3 except for video and I did not really use video that much and 720p was good enough for me. Even so I decided to wait a month and see if the 5N was going to be much better than the C3. Steve Huff's review clinched it for me. I ordered the 5N with both the 16mm and 18-55mm. The 16mm would keep the camera small and I still could have the extra range when I needed it.I had high hopes for the 5N, but I expected to be disappointed. Well I was not; it is as perfect as I need, where it really matters, high ISO performance. I can say only one thing about the images AMAZING!!!  In good light even a P&S; is good enough, but the light rarely good when you really need it. The Nex 5N is just way better than I expected no matter what the light. It has a few annoying handling issues, but are they important? NO, not for me. I don't make a living taking pictures, so taking a few seconds longer to change settings makes no difference. The machine has so many features that I rarely expect to use, so it will still take me time to do anything other than my usual changes, ISO, White balance and aperture and let the camera do most of the rest. I hope to not use the flash very often, so the lack of a hot shoe dose't bother me. Others have reviewed the features of this camera very well so I will not restate them. The feature that I really like the most is the hand-held twilight mode, where it uses the 10 FPS capability to take 6 rapid pictures an intelligently merge and combine them to create one noise reduced jpeg image. I love it.If you want good pictures whatever the light, and don't have a guy to carry your camera equipment, I don't think you will do better than this camera at almost any price.

Also, focusing with manual lenses is difficult to really nail, even with focus peaking, I almost always need to rely on Focus Assist (this is where I imagine a DSLR with a bright split screen focusing screen might be highly preferable).I use it mainly with adapted manual lenses, great image quality (comparable to Nikon D7000 at a fraction of the price and size) and low light capability (grainy but still quite usable at ISO 3200).  The additional (but expensive) FDA-EV1S Electronic Viewfinder is pretty much a must for manual lens use, and also makes the process much more enjoyable to look \"through\" an actual viewfinder and use that point of contact as an additional point of stability to add steadiness to shots in lower light.  (One advantage this EVF offers over built-in on the NEX-6 and 7 is swivel capability, but it does add bulk, and given the EVF's high price (was $350 initially, now dropping), if I were buying new I'd need to give serious consideration to NEX-6, which offers a second (much needed) control dial (for aperture, shutter speed, EV), standard hot shoe, built-in flash).Note:  since this is now an old model (superceded by NEX-6 and 5R), you can find NEX-5N on that popular auction site for under $400, which is a bargain for this level of functionality and quality, if you don't need the wi-fi capability of the newer models.

It has a bit of annoying barrel distortion at 18mm if you turn the correction off or you shoot in RAW.  Not a whole bunch of choices for lenses to replace it either.

It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses. You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open. The only big downside to this body is the lack of a true hot shoe (the new NEX-6 addressed this). You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera. Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash. Other than that you are stuck to either trying to utilize a hot shoe adapter + radio trigger, an external slave flash in manual mode and triggered optically (think Nikon SU-4), or else some sort of home-brew setup. Still, the flash quirk aside, this is a great camera for traveling or walking around.

I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography. (Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've only just started using it as I got it 2.5 days ago. It takes amazingly clear action shots. That feature and the ability to filter black and white with color selection were some of the reasons I bought it. The zoom is okay but I don't have much to compare it to. I haven't used it for video yet so I can't comment on that. It's lightweight, touchscreen is there but I can use the buttons on the side too which is a HUGE plus for me. I hate being forced into nothing but touchscreen, I like the buttons most times on devices that aren't phones. But I digress. So far the rest of the \"pros\" are it's easy to use- it has an onscreen information blurb that comes up when you select something; it allows for automatic or manual functionality. So after I learn more about cameras and how to use manual speeds or adjustments I can but as a beginner I don't need a special class the camera just does it for me; even when my hand or the subject is moving all of the pics don't come out blurry; all of the options and possible future upgrades so I won't have to buy a whole new camera, this one can grow with me as my knowledge grows. Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on. The ability to control the focus or focus area is also pretty awesome.My cons are relatively superfluous....I wish it wasn't black as I'm partial to blue or green or silver electronics. That has no bearing on the camera's performance, obviously. As for camera performance, unless I can figure it out soon, if I take a picture vertically when I go back to look through them it just shows up smaller but vertical. I can't figure how to get it to show up the same size as it was when I took it. That's just a small irk though.Hopefully this helps if you're a photography novice like I am. This probably isn't too helpful to someone with a large knowledge base but....I enjoy the camera, I'd recommend it to someone else looking for a camera.

I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket. But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen. After reading reviews, I thought this might be an okay size for the quality. So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens. After one month using the NEX-5N, I have not regretted my purchase for one second.First, the photos are so good. The clarity is stunning. I have cropped photos to 1/6 of what the original size and the clarity is still better than photos from my powershot. I have received so many compliments for photos I have shared this month. I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!). And most of the time, I am just using the intelligent auto feature. I am sure I will learn in the future how to use the NEX-5N even better.Second, the weight and size are fine. Easy to cary in a backpack if I am hiking. And, at an event like a wedding, I can just carry it around.As far as negatives, I have found the menu system somewhat confusing, but I am used to canon menus. I also wish the kit lens was a little brighter. And, using intelligent auto, sometimes seems to be a little dark and I will choose to brighten up the photo a notch before shooting. Finally, it is too easy to press the movie button.Overall, I am simply thrilled with this camera.

I was so impressed, that I had to get one for myself.  This camera is simply fantastic.  I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.  While the NEX-5N isn't pocket-sized, it's much smaller that the typical DSLR.First, the build quality is great.  It feels sturdy and all the exterior parts seem nicely crafted.  The lens is light, but feels substantial.  Changing lenses is as easy as pressing a button, popping off one lens, and slipping on the other lens.Second, the picture quality is amazingly detailed.  For instance, I have taken Chicago skyline pictures and the windows of each building look crisp.  I was stunned at the details after seeing the images of Chicago on my computer screen for the first time.  None of my other cameras have been able to capture it in such detail.  One caveat, is that when I zoom in on my computer, I start to see distortion.  I'm not an expert photographer, but I assume this is normal with a camera at this price point.The camera is also great for taking pictures of dogs and people.  It's taken some really cute pictures of my dog.  Sometimes I have to guide the focus so get the camera to focus on my dog's face.  This is easy though since all I have to do is tap the screen in the spot I want the camera to focus and it focuses.  It will also track movement of that spot, so if my dog moves her head, the camera tracks it and still focuses on her head.The camera is also amazingly fast.  I can just snap away.  I've never owned a camera that could take so many pictures so quickly.  I can just snap away.  I have snapped some great pictures of my dog playing.So far, I haven't needed to use the flash much.  I prefer taking natural photos and this camera does a great job.  It handles high ISOs nicely. I still prefer using lower ISOs whenever possible, but this camera has far less noise at high ISOs than other cameras I have used.  One thing this camera is lacking is a setting that would let me set a maximum automatic ISO.  It has so many other settings, I was surprised that a maximum ISO setting is not one of them.  It would be nice if Sony released a firmware update that would enable a setting for maximum ISO.Overall, this is a wonderful camera and I highly recommend it.

What makes using  manual lenses possible is a great feature called lens peaking which will highlight the focused high contrast areas with little dots to allow you to fast focus manually.

I like it better than the NEX 7, which I also had for a while but returned. The NEX 7 electronic viewfinder doesn't do it for me, increases the size of the box, and adds too much to the cost. The 5n is smaller, less expensive, and has a sensor which is slightly less noisey than the 7 due to fewer megapixels. And if you really want the EVF, you can add it to the accessory slot.Image quality is superb. I have compared directly with Nikon D7000, D3200, Fuji XPro1 and even the full frame Nikon D800E and the Sony produces magnificent photos along with any of them. Of course it has lower pixel density than the D800E, but the colors and the noise level at ISO3200 are just about equal. Images are a bit inferior to the XPro1 in terms of noise and smoothness, but the NEX 5n costs 1/3 as much and is a lot smaller.There is a growing market for digital cameras for photo enthusiasts who want better image quality than is available from small-sensor Point and Shoot or from cell phone cameras. The NEX 5n is the big jump you are looking for. Why bother with Micro 4/3 when this NEX is just about the same body size but has twice as big a sensor? Also the NEX 5n's E-mount has a very short flange to sensor distance (18mm) and so can use (with adapters) all those lenses you have already on your shelf, Nikon, Canon, Sony A, Pentax, Leica M-mount, all of them. They are used in manual focus mode of course but Sony has included a magical feature - the in-focus points are highlighted in a bright color - which makes this quite easy. Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus. A friendly, precision made little box which produces georgeous pictures.Overall, the NEX 5n is the sweet spot of the NEX line, and you will love it.

This equates to the same picture quality, but instead of leaving your bulky and costly DSLR at home, you are more likely to take the NEX with you. If you shoot fast moving subjects like sports, you'll prefer a DSLR as the autofocus on the NEX just isn't as good. But for everything else, the quality is on par. I sold my professional Canon 5D for this camera because the images are very similar quality, but the NEX is much easier to carry and I don't fear having it stolen the way I do a DSLR. DSLRs generally have a better selection of lenses, but the NEX lenses are adequate and you can also use older manual focus lenses and Sony Alpha lenses with appropriate adapters.The Micro Four Thirds (m43) camera systems have a better lens selection but smaller sensor. If you want you want professional portraits where your subjects stand out from blurred backgrounds, the NEX makes it much easier. The larger NEX sensor equates to shallower depth of field, which gives the defocused/blurred backgrounds to your portraits. For me, the lens selection on NEX is adequate, and so sensor size is the determining factor, putting NEX ahead.Compared to a point and shoot, the NEX is leaps ahead. The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc. The larger sensor in the NEX collects a lot more light and gives substantially better low light performance than point and shoot cameras. You will almost never need to use the flash on the NEX, and that alone will make a huge difference versus washed out flash photos from a point and shoot. The larger sensor also equates to portraits with blurred backgrounds that people pop out from, versus the flat, lifeless snapshots from a point and shoot. You can put this camera in automatic mode and still get better pictures than a point and shoot, and as you learn more about the camera, those pictures will only improve.Compared to the NEX 3 and C3, the 5N adds some great features. The grip is easier to hold, although larger than, the 3/C3. This is both good and bad, and so you should decide based on hand size and portability. The C3 and 5N have an improved sensor from the original 3/5. It's not just more megapixels, which makes little difference, but actually designed for better performance, particularly with wide lenses around the edge of the picture. The difference is welcome, but not substantial. The 5N also adds built in correction profiles for JPEG shooters, which improves pictures further. The 5N has a faster and quieter shutter than the 3/C3. The 5N touch screen also allows you to easily select focus points. If you shoot manual focus lenses and/or in RAW mode, the C3 probably is sufficient.

Either you got great images in all environments but with a bulky dSLR body, or you got close to great images in some settings (daytime) with a compact body. The NEX-5N to me is the camera that gives you the best of everything, it did in fact produce better OOC jpeg images than the 550d in some low light settings. I am kind of a resolution freak and the NEX-5N produces an astonishingly sharp image when paired with the Sigma 30mm f2.8. The images are just as great, both in contrast and sharpness, when paired with old manual focus lenses once you get the focused right. Everyone should give manual lenses a shot since the camera offers several options when focuses. Either touch the LCD at the area to blow it up and focus by eye or you could use the focus peaking feature which highlights edges which are currently in focus as you turn the focus ring. Despite rave reviews of its Out of camera JPEG quality, to obtain the best shot out of every image, RAW processing is still required to really get the most out of your camera. This applies to all high end cameras, in built JPEG engines just do not do the sensor justice especially in harsh lighting conditions. The only downside for me, and most people as well, is the non standard camera menu layout and controls. Options are placed in sub menus which are not conventional or consistent with the rest of the camera world making the initial use of the camera a rather distasteful experience. However, the options and controls themselves ARE there, somewhere, and at least you CAN adjust them to get that shot you had planned. I give the NEX-5N 5 out of 5 stars.In summary:Get a 30mm Sigma f2.8 it is insanely sharp and darn cheap as wellGo into old 1970s, 1980s high performance manual focus lenses given that the camera has various ways to make manual focusing fun and easyRAW process your images to get the most out of this camera, you just must if you want to fully reap the sensor benefitsArranging the options and repositioning the control layout in a way that is consistent with the rest of camera world would have made this THE perfect camera.

Bought this after reading a couple score reviews on the top entry-level cameras in the genre. In the two days between the order and getting the camera we looked through a few crash-course intros to dSLR shooting online (i.e. What is ISO? How does aperture size affect depth of field?), but other than that we were total photography noobs.  The day it came in we went out with our 11 month old out for a morning photo shoot in the park.  Wow!  We'll never go to another studio for family shots again, no need!  Honestly, when we went home and put the shots up on our 47\" TV we were shocked by how high-quality the shots were.  We'd never gotten a half decent shot of our kid except in direct sunlight, but with this in the first 10 minutes we got about 10 we'd blow up and hang on our wall.  My quick interview-style video with my wife was broadcast quality.  I'd read about a clicking noise when shaking the camera, but shook it about as hard as I could and not a peep.My only beef is that when filming at 1080p/60fps there was some significant compression noise.

It is smaller and has less buttons - less intimidating for my non-photographer wife to use.B. $120 less than the Nikon with similar kit lens.C. Sony is rated  better in low light performance, and most other aspects seem equal.What I am missing out on by not getting the Nikon: More buttons on the body, viewfinder, access to a wider range of lenses and external flashes.These are items I can live without. If you just want to take great shots and don't want to grow into being a \"photographer\" of sorts - the Sony is probably a better choice.The touchscreen on the Sony allows you to touch an object on the screen and make it your point of focus. Its like manual focus for dummies.There are not a lot of buttons on the camera, but the dial and touchscreen still give quick access to controls.In dim light, I've found ISO 1600 and 3200 settings to produce pretty clean shots (especially 1600 and below). ISO6400 is OK for the web, but gets grainy.I took the camera to dinner at a dim restaurant. It performed much better than my other cameras, but I was not blown away.For standard indoor lighting, the Sony does do pretty well. Shots are brighter and cleaner than any shots I've ever seen from a digital.The fast continuous shooting mode is impressive. Everyone is in awe when they here the rapid-fire.The shutter also makes a nice \"mechanical\" sound when you take a shot. With the large lens barrel and shutter sound, this comes across as a serious camera, without the DSRL bulk.There is a \"smile detect\" feature that fires the shutter when a smile is detected. Works pretty well and is a cool party trick.Could come in handy in place of a timer for group shots \"Say Cheese\" would have to be timed just right.All in all, I recommend this camera to pretty much anyone who is happy with the size or if and wants to take great shots.You have access to full control, or can just set it to intelligent mode and fire on auto.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "We love it!", "Author": "Sang A.

I use the 7 strictly for older \"heritage\" lenses (manual focus, primes, tripod-mounted) while I use the 5n handheld to shoot with the current optically-stablized E-mount auto-focus zoom lenses.  Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.  And JPEG's taken with the 18-55 kit lens on the 5n actually look better than when the same lens is on the 7, although the 7 is marginally sharper when shooting in RAW mode with most prime lenses.Another thing that I like about the 5n compared to the 7 is that the 5n is easier to shoot in \"stealth mode,\" meaning at the end of neck strap held close to one's tummy with LCD tilted up and using one's finger to touch the live-view screen to select the focal point for auto focus.  I also keep the provided add-on flash, as well as the optional add-on EVF, in little storage bags that I loop onto the camera's neck strap for whenever either of them is needed, although you cannot use both at the same time.The 5n also is marginally better (i.e., less \"noise\") than the 7 when limited lighting calls for higher ISO settings and also produces less vignetting and color shift when using certain wide-angle \"rangefinder\" manual lenses.

Its like holding a PS3 controller. Feels as if its made out of the same plastic too. Super easy to handle, and maneuver with. Fun to use. Very balanced.The moveable rear LCD is awesome for all photographers, but a gift for professionals. Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here. Very responsive and neat.I dont know why so many people complain about the UI its SO EASY!!! I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking. Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film. The UI does seem pretty limited to me though, and i would have really really liked to have had an on-board cropper for this price range.The on-board effects are awesome although again pretty limited for this price range, this thing can take some stunning B/W photos.The AF is pretty spot on though its illuminator has the potential to be blocked by your finger if you are not paying attention, due to the styling of the body.With an ISO of 25600 and flash you have no worries about low light photos, i dont see why you couldnt take a superior photo in low light, with some skill and imagination..This camera is a pretty quick shot, not as fast as the NIKON J1 and V1 both of which are praised for thier speed advantages over the NEX series but it keeps up just fine. Continuous burst shots comes in a well paced quick succession.The large Sensor gives off some beautifully clear and vibrant colorful shots. With 16.2 MP the photos should print very nicely considering you use the right type of paper and printer.The HD Video, WHOA!! its super crisp and smooth, and lets get serious, not intended to shoot feature films on. Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak. If your battery is at 100% after about two minutes of any type of use with the camera it wil be down to 98%.Will last probably eight hours if you went out shooting all day, and made sure to turn it off when not in use.I've heard all the stories about these cameras clicking and overheating during recording a movie and almost didnt buy one because of, but ive not had any problem of the sort, but then again my longest short film is 3:00.I dont like the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used in tandem. The fact that they are small and sort of fragile and toy like makes me hope for a long and everlasting future of digital photography joy with them. Although, this is a non issue for me because I bought a Case Logic SLRC-205 DSLR bag to go with my NEX5N. Perfect bag by the way for any DSLR camera and its parts.I love the overall sleekness and kitsch factor. I understand why SONY didnt include the viewfinder and flash even though it seems like backwards economy, they made this camera and kind of left it in the middle for all types of photographers to be baited to from the family shooter to the professionl on the move.SONY sort of marketed the NEX series in the likes of companies like APPLE with their consistently upgradeable products.Thats what i love about the way the executed it. The NEX5N is basically what you make it, and it can be a admirable little brother when compared to the NEX-7.When you buy the core NEX bundle and you have an awesome point and shooter with DSLR capabilities via the interchangeable lenes. So there, they have satisfied the P&S; crowd of mom, dads, and occasional shooters who only use thier cameras on vacation.If you are a hobbyist or professional photog, you have the choice of buying the viewfinder and flash and different lenses making this little thing a pretty formidable choice for the compact DSLR market.It goes both ways on the ILC/DSLR front.SONY is trying to make everyone happy on this one. Smart move.I say buy it, I was on the fence about this camera for about three months of debating wheter to spend the money or buy the Nikon V1 (which i still will buy good camera) or wait until they get cheaper, which is already happening.

But I also was reluctant to lug the full size DLSRs around. This camera is brilliant! If you want an analysis of the precise accuracy of color, pixelation and such, those reviews already exist. This is for folks wanting a quick assessment of this camera's overall use.First, it is hard to imagine someone going wrong with this camera. The shutter is extremely quick, the auto-focus is also quick, responsive, and very accurate. The processor does anticipate your photography style well, so it adapted settings to better catch the cat while running (cat clearly in focus on blurred grass background), to still image photography with zero changes on my end. Low light shots are amazing so far. One of my disappointments with lower end (read point and shoot) is that no matter what I did, I could not take decent night shots. With this I can. Want a shot with flash -- just pop up the attachable flash. Close it and you can shoot without added flash, so switching back and forth to experiment with color or lighting couldn't be easier.The interface is intuitive and well designed. I love that I can switch from movie to still by using different buttons (movie button starts and stops movie, and stills are initiated through the shutter release). Review your images by pushing \"play\" and switch quickly back to snap more shots by pressing the shutter button again.A full features touch screen adds features and functionality and has the bonus of being movable so you can see what you want to shoot from multiple angles.Want to use different features (shutter priority, focus adjustment, switching what the camera is tracking for focus just to name a few) -- all are just a touch or two and are intuitively located where and how one would expect.  This is a sophisticated tool that can be well utilized without ever touching a user manual (and yet clearly has features that only a manual could fully address because they are so sophitsitcated).16.1M is a great size to grab more than adequate detail and yet remain affordable. As much as I love this camera, I may try the upgrade, but at nearly treble the cost for a 50% increase in image size, that will wait quite a bit. In the mean time, more lens have come out for this series of cameras, and I can't wait to try the newer 50-200 range.I compared this camera both online and in stores with other models (including the Nikon) and this camera absolutely is in a class by itself.

I am yet to explore most of it. But my impression is very good.At first, I was very anxious about the clicking sound during video recording and I was glad that it was not present. The video recording is excellent and clear. A camcoder can't be any better regarding picture. My only concern about video is the use of the lens ring to make zoom which makes me prefer the P&S; and camcoder in this point only. The sound recording is so clear.As I am used to nikon D5100 and lumix LX5, I miss more external control knobs and function keys. but when you use the camera a little more, you become more adapted to the available ones. The image review (playback) options seems limited compared to the mentioned cameras.The grip of the camera is very good and comfortable putting in mind its relatively small size. It is light and feels very well built. The screen is very clear except in some strong sunlight where it is hard to read the details but can see the view.The photos are incredibly detailed and sharp. What I have read about image quality was true. As for what I have shot till now, the steady shot is doing a good job and none of the photos got shaked except one with a moving subject.The colors are nice but it took me some time to till I knew that vivid option is better in most of the situations to give the photos more life. However, I find the nikon D5100 gives more natural colors. The high ISO performance is characteristic and matches the best DSLR may be appoaching the FF degree. I had no opportunity to make more trials of photographing moving subjects.The 18-55 lens is very well compatible with the camera and makes very sharp images. I miss the quick menu of the LX5. I wished the flash is built inThese were my first impressions about the sony nex-5n which seems to have more secrets. I shall post an update when I use the camera for more time to comment on different functions..Update 1: after using the camera for almost a month:1. the video quality is really superb. very clear image and sound.2. the colors are bright, sometimes feeling not natural.3. the screen is very clear and bright. but a factor should be put in mind that the photos may appear less bright on computer's screen. it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen. I lately tested the Lumix LX7 and this point is more apparent than with the sony(very bright saturated on camera's screen and much less on the computer's screen.4. fantastic high ISO performance up to ISO 3200. Almost no noise up to this ISO. In my opinion it beats the nikon D5100 and the Canon 600D in this respect, but the Nikon appear better regarding color taste towards natural.5. The photos are so sharp with the kit lens than expected. I think it is one of the sharpest output I've seen.6. I, till now, not satisfied with the balance of exposure done by the supplied flash. the accessory flash from sony which is higher and can make bouncing is expenive (148 US$).

It also takes great pics and especially videos.But there are also a couple of flaws which spoil the overall experience.1. The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities. (Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed. I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.) On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes. On this camera this requires using 3 additional steps. In general controls are not very convenient and are easily messed up by accidental presses.2. The video clicking issue is of course very annoying and is very obvious even when using the camera very smoothly and carefully. Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue. Hopefully I'll get myself to send the camera to Sony and get it fixed.3. Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4. AF also appears to be too slow for taking pics of action.Overall given it's compactness I think it's great: it's just nowhere close to a decent DSLR for shooting pics of moving kids. At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos. So I use it mostly for videos or when too lazy to bring a DSLR.Finally if you're used to Canon cameras be prepared to be confused by the reversed zoom-in/zoom-out rotation direction on the kit lens.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "POV of a point and shooter", "Author": "Leo Kwong", "ReviewID": "RUBLKHJWE08JM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera. It still doesn't consistently take better pictures than my friend's DSLR, but I really think it's a skill level issue. I use the Auto mode basically all the time. It works wonders. I really think it even detects the difference between an adult face and a baby face. I took a bunch of pictures in a bar and some of them were good some were bad. I think that modern cameras in general have the issue that the picture looks too good on the tiny high res LCD and when you see it on your computer it's not as sharp as you think. Most of the issue I have has to do with lighting. The build-in flash is bad because it flattens all the details and doesn't allow things in the background to show up. What I do is put an index card on the bottom of the flash so that the light bounces to the ceiling and that creates a much better indoor shot; I would say just as good as a DSLR. The size is perfect for me. I can put it in the pocket of my jacket, barely. But it's importantly because some places in the city, I really don't want to let people know I'm carry an expensive camera. I didn't buy any case because it feels very solid. The only thing is that the lens cap has no string or anything, so I have to be careful where I put it and not leave it on the table or something. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking to get good pictures if you're a point and shoot person like me.

The APS-C sensor gives this camera DSLR quality photos with very little compromise, as well as high ISO performance. In fact, the sensor used in the Nex 5n is a slightly improved version of the sensor used in the Nikon D7000. My only major complaint is the lack of native lenses for the e mount system, this however is an unavoidable consequence of a relatively new mounting system. Sony is working hard at addressing the issue, but they really need to have pancake primes. However, the one really nice thing about the nex system is its small flange length. The small flange length allows the nex to be compatible with virtually any lens using an adapter. This means Leica lenses on a small quality frame, without paying thousands for an M9. My current lens of choice is a asahi supertak 50mm f1.4 lens, using an m42 adapter. Focus peaking makes using manual lenses an absolute joy to use (even for a novice like me).I can put this camera in the side pocket of my backpack or messenger bag and not have to worry about the system taking up too much space.

These cameras served their purpose, but all were ditched except the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 because of its 10x zoom, IQ, ease of use and convenience vs. a big DSLR.Fast forward 2-3 years...The TZ5 went on many adventures, had been dropped more than a few times (never by me of course) and AF performance suffered. I started researching P&S;, Extended Zoom, Mirrorless and DSLR cameras and eventually narrowed it down to the Panasonic DMC-FZ200, Pentax K-30, Sony Alpha A57 and the Sony NEX-5N. My lust for a DSLR grew less and less with my research on mirrorless cameras because I began to love the thought of a small, compact camera system (with removable lenses). Also, I needed (wanted) IQ that could rival most DSLR cameras and put any P&S; to shame.My decision was based on about two weeks of solid research where I referenced many websites including dpreview.com, photozone.de, ephotozine.com, photographyblog.com, cameralabs.com, sonyalphalab.com, lensrentals.com, slrgear.com, photographyreview.com, improvephotography.com, stevehuffphoto.com, photoclubalpha.com, kurtmunger.com, digitalcamerainfo.comI suggest you reference these sites, watch demonstrations on YouTube and check out sample images (just do a google search and I'm sure you will find some).BODY vs. KITOnce I knew the NEX-5N was the right camera for me, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to purchase the body only due to the limited selection of Sony E-Mount lenses and I liked that I could easily upgrade to a Sony DSLR if I wanted. I couldn't justify spending the money on the E-Mount lenses because it offered absolutely no flexibility or deviation from the E-Mount line. Another reason that made my purchase of the LA-EA2 adapter super easy was the lack of positive professional reviews on the E-Mount lenses. Yes, these lenses would probably be good for the average user, but I am far from the average user and want the best for my budget.Note: A-Mount lenses will only work with the NEX-5N if the Sony LA-EA1 ($140) or LA-EA2 ($275) adapter is used.LENSESEven though the selection of E-Mount lenses is limited, a wide variety of focal lengths are covered. As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens. How could I pass this up? Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible! Awesome. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the Tamron lenses (if purchased from an authorized seller) have a 6 year warranty...not that you would ever need to collect on this, but Sony's 1 year warranty is a pathetic attempt at best.ORDERI ordered the NEX-5N (body only) from 42photo.com because they had the best price and what I thought was a decent track record. The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card. I find this to be terrible practice and hate being pestered when all I want is to receive my product quickly so I can begin enjoying it.The product arrived within a few days of ordering (as expected). I was a little surprised to see that the product box I received was for a NEX-5N with a double lens kit (16mm & 18-55mm). I was under the impression that the NEX-5N body only was offered from Sony in its respectable box and not one that was separated from the kit lenses. The separation of these items concerned me because that meant someone had their grubby hands on my product/in the box and the camera was placed loosely at best in the box with no additional padding or protection. I just hoped the camera was brand new and there weren't any accessories missing.It turns out that the camera appears to be brand new as there were no signs of use, no fingerprints or smudges and no scratches or dents. The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated. Without a lens attached, this camera was no bigger than an average sized P&S; and was as light as a feather. The small size isn't a bad thing for me because I have medium sized hands and the camera was reasonably easy to grip with my right hand.A really nice feature of this camera is the tilt-able touch-screen. It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up). I was hoping this one would flip all the way up so you could take self portraits, but it doesn't. I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door. It's not a big deal, but I noticed that it will move ever so slightly with very little effort. Don't get me wrong, the lock is good and I wouldn't be worried about it opening on accident, but the door could have been more precise in the way it fit when closed to eliminate the slight movement. The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46). This is a class 10 card with specs that claim up to 45mb/s. It comes with a limited lifetime warranty and is water, temperature, shock and x-ray proof.When the camera was switched on, nothing happened. I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger. Meanwhile, I referenced google to see if this was normal. I believe the answer was found on the dpreview forum. Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on. Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate. This procedure is normal and your camera is performing an automated pixel mapping routine. The camera captures an unexposed frame and will analyze it sometime later for hot/stuck pixels. Some people have reported that the battery life will drop by 15-20% after this analysis due to the processing of the pixel mapping procedure. I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18). Before I decided to not purchase into the E-Mount line, I did purchase this one from B&H; Photo because this and the 24mm Zeiss (SEL24F18Z) are really the only very good rated E-Mount lenses.Anyway, I snapped a few photos of various objects around the house but was extremely disappointed with the quality of the LCD screen. No matter what type of lighting environment I introduced to the camera, all I could see on the screen was noise. I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good. This camera really does a nice job and the end result is much better than my trusty P&S.;I took this opportunity to test most of the functions on the camera and found that I really had no use for the touch screen. My fingers kept returning to the 4-way control dial - which by the way was designed very well. You can either rotate the outer ring of the dial to move through the menu options or you can press on the dial (up, down, left, right). Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera. I think the touch screen on my 4 year old, off brand GPS unit works better.While I was browsing through the menus, I viewed the setup options for video recording. I found that the camera I received was the European version (PAL, 50i) and was extremely disappointed in the seller as they were supposed to send the US version (NTSC, 60i). I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this. I did find out that there is a label on the bottom of the camera that has the 50i or 60i specification. Believe it or not, my camera had the label for 60i and even the product box stated 60i. Because of this, the camera must be returned, but not before I test the LA-EA2 adapter with the Tamron 17-50 & 70-300mm lenses.I will NEVER do business with 42photo.com again and suggest you purchase elsewhere. The most reliable places I've done business with are Amazon and B&H; Photo.LA-EA2 ADAPTER & 2 TAMRON LENSESAll three of these items were purchased from Amazon and arrived in 2 days thanks to my Prime Membership. The LA-EA2 was unboxed first and it came in a really nice semi-hard padded & zippered case. The actual adapter is huge! It's oddly shaped, and roughly the same size as the camera. I think it might weigh more. Anyway, I attached the adapter to the camera and despite its gigantic proportions, actually added to the overall grip one could have while holding the camera. Of course, you would need to grip this with your left hand so your right hand is free to access the controls, but unfortunately this does present a potential problem when trying to zoom or focus manually (I'll explain later).The Tamron lenses seem to be built very well (and they should be for the price). They both have pretty good reviews from professionals and consumers and should offer better IQ than standard kit lenses. The only issue I noticed with the Tamron lenses is that when mounted there is a small amount of play. It's not enough to break the connection or cause AF problems, but it is noticeable. This issue is probably worth taking up to 1/2 a star off the rating of the lens itself but not worth making a stink over or even worth returning it.The camera, with the adapter and either of the lenses, transformed into a small DSLR. That's not a bad thing, but due to the extra weight and odd shape of the adapter, the combination became quite uncomfortable. I'm sure you could (but probably wouldn't want to) hold the camera with just your right hand because depending on what lens you were using, could add much more stress to the mounting areas. To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand. I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter. This was more comfortable, but now it would be impossible to zoom or MF with the lens. And if you were using a larger lens (like the 70-300) taking your hand from the adapter to the lens could present a problem because you need to be 100% confident in your grip with your right hand since the camera is now front heavy.LA-EA2 PERFORMANCEAll the people that reviewed this adapter were not kidding when they said this thing offers exceptionally fast AF performance. I can confirm that AF is extremely fast and accurate with this adapter...much faster than the 50mm E-Mount lens I tested. You should have no problem trying to get \"that shot\" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed. IQ is going to be much better than most, if not all, P&S; cameras and the low light abilities are impressive (thanks to the mirrorless design).For someone who has invested in A-Mount lenses or would like the flexibility to upgrade to a Sony DSLR in the future, you will be able to use these lenses with the camera provided you purchase the LA-EA1 or LA-EA2 adapter. Unfortunately, I think you're better off sticking with a DSLR because once the adapter and lens is added you're right back to where you started and the minimal camera size becomes dwarfed by the combo. And with the addition of these items, the cost for the NEX-5N actually is more than an entry or mid level DSLR.OUTCOMEIf more lenses were available, if you could attach A-Mount lenses directly to this camera without an adapter and if you could get a body only version that really is the US version at the price I got, I would not hesitate to purchase and keep this camera. But since the current E-Mount lens line-up is not impressive and you need an adapter and the purchase of the body only from a trusted seller like Amazon is another $150 than what I paid, it just doesn't make sense for me to keep this camera.CHECK OUT THE MATH (Amazon Pricing)NEX-5N Body Only: $500LA-EA2 Adapter: $275Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,550.00STL-A57 Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter. I purchased the A57 and haven't looked back. It's a great camera with many of the same features as the NEX-5N and is about the same size and weight (if the adapter and lens was connected to the NEX-5N). Even though the A57 uses the same ASP-C image sensor, the high ISO performance is a bit noisier than the NEX-5N, however, if you use the LA-EA2 adapter with the NEX-5N I would assume that the ISO performance would be about the same since you are now introducing the translucent mirror technology to the NEX-5N and this mirror will cause more noise at higher ISO.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "So close to greatness...", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R2456Y8F6LHQIY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs. I love the quality of DSLRs but have felt that the size of the camera prevents me from taking it with me everywhere, essentially missing out a lot of great photos. The old saying \"The worst quality picture is the one you never took\" applies to me big time. This is why I was thrilled to find a camera that should produce images on par with the best amateur DSLRs in the body of a compact and with Sony's outstanding tilting screen (I take lots of pictures of my girls and believe me photographing them from their eye level is the only way to go).Here are my pros and cons:Image quality is very good. Good detail. Nice saturated Sony colors (I personally like them but some purists don't)Incredible ISO noise handling. You can use ISO 1600 and never notice loss of detail unless you do giant prints.ISO 3200 and 6400 totally usable - eliminates the need for using flash in most casesIncredibly small body. You need to hold it to feel how small it isSolid construction. Heavy metal body.Cool image features - in camera panorama stitching, HDR photography, 3D (don't know about this last one, but may be useful)High quality video 1080-60P looks greatFast. Zero wake up time. 10 fps. Shoots like a machine gunTouch screen allows touch focusingLovely peek focusing for those of you who like to tweak autofocusCons:User interface not great. No dial mode. Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless. Seems like an afterthought. Hoping Sony will improve through firmware updateVideo clicking problem (Google it), not a showstopper, but definitely annoying (supposedly there is a fix but you need to send the camera to Sony)Lens selection extremely limited.No stills while in movie mode (something starting to appear in cameras and really, why not?)Kit flash complete crap. I have removed it completelyLens cap comes with no string (a $10 replacement is easy to pick up, but come on Sony, why??)Lenses are very big which defeated the point of a small body (haven't tried the 16m prime because of negative reviews)18-55 kit lens construction only OK, twisting the zoom is not smooth, can be felt (and heard) in video mode).I must say. I am very happy with my purchase and would have given 4.5 stars if possible. Just annoyed Sony came so close to greatness and messed up some small, easy to fix details.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Got it used", "Author": "Brian K. Klein", "ReviewID": "R2WNEOAXH0G2IH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Living, working, and traveling abroad for the past few years, I  sought to capture my experiences to rub in people's faces on the interwebs. I was in the market for a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, after my compact camera broke, my DSLR was too heavy with expensive lenses, and my phone camera wasn't cutting it.Admittedly, at first I was only interested in the micro four thirds market. They had a lot of lenses, were affordable, and looked nice. Fujifilm's x series were sleek, classy, and sexy but came with a high price that I wasn't willing to pay. I did consider the Sony NEX series, but shrugged it off because of the price (at  the time the kits that caught my eye were sub $1,000). I also laughed at how it looked (I know... shallow). While browsing for a new camera in Seoul, I was unsatisfied with every camera/price I found until I came across a used white Sony NEX 5n with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for about $200 less than a new model. It was a no-brainer, especially because it out specs most of the mirrorless competition.The Good:The sensor - APS-C sized, digital dx DSLR quality sensor at 16.1 MP, could possibly be the same or similar to the one in my old Nikon D7000. Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid. All the important stuff about being a camera is just fantastic. The 1.5x crop factor is useful to me. My current dslr is full frame, and I wanted a little more reach, yet I wanted to avoid having too much lens distortion on the wide end. For example, a micro four thirds camera has about 2x magnification due to its sensor size. A 14mm lens would equal 28mm on a full frame. Thats the equivalent of 21mm on this camera. Therefore, if one were interested in wider angles with less distortion, the NEX sensor size is a better choice in regards to mirrorless. Not to mention the low light performance and shallow depth of field would appear better on a bigger sensor (theoretically).The lens - This model comes with the 18-55mm zoom, not to be confused with the flatter motorized 16-50mm zoom. For a kit lens, I am impressed. The metal construction is great. It seems pretty sharp, and CAs and distortion are not bad.Video quality - Maybe this is my favorite thing about this camera. High quality, continuous focus, and really fun to use.Build quality - This tiny body with tilting touch lcd screen can survive a fall from about 3 or 4 feet high and land flat on the screen and be okay. I know because it happened to me by accident within the first week of ownership. No problem at all. It feels solid, the lens is metal, and it is very light.Speed - This camera is capable of continuosly taking photos faster than my dslr. That's great for the panoramic mode, HDR mode, or sports.The gimmicks - Yes, the art filters, hdr mode, panoramic mode, and tilting toucnscreen are fun. In fact, I love it even though it's kind of a gimmick.The so-so:Screen tilt - It barely tilts enough to be of any real use to me. Newer models, like 5T fully tilt so you can do selfies.Touch screen - Using it to focus is cool. That's about it. You can use it for menu options but the font is tiny and its easier for me to click the actual buttons right next to it.Attachable flash - Some love it, some hate it, I don't care.The lens - It is a great kit lens, but pretty standard. You won't get crazy wide angles or long telephoto with super shallow depth of field with it. Although it has pretty close focus. Other lenses are available, but not a lot. You can pay a boatload of cash for an adapter and pay another boatload of cash to use Sony Alpha dslr lenses. That is kind of cool, but pricey.The body - The camera body is small, sleek, and built well. However, it looks weird to me. The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty. I think the camera and lens looks comical.The menus - They make sense, but for the sake of simplicity with the button layout, sometimes you have to go in and out of the menus to get the settings you want. Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day. Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it. If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most. Indoors in a quiet home, the mic is fine. All other situations require better options, and only the overpriced Sony proprietary crap external mic is available because of their weird attachment. That drives me up the wall, but Sony's proprietary crap is a whooole other story, and this is a photo camera first, not primarily for video.No hot shoe - Not a huge deal for me, but once again Sony proprietary connections forces you to buy their flashes if you want other flash options.Missed AF/Softness - This is sort of a common issue with these cameras. I am not sure if it is one or the other, but sometimes it seems the AF is a little bit off. Maybe its because of the high res sensor and the lens requires focus tuning or something. It doesn't happen to a lot of photos, but does happen. I just try to refocus, adjust my angle, and lighting if needed. You don't have to be a pixel-peeper to notice either....Conclusion:I love this camera and would not return it or trade it for another mirrorless camera. I dare say it is one of the best mirrorless cameras you can get. The Sony proprietary connections are pretty annoying, along with the focus issue, and it is not the prettiest camera (I would rate it 3.5 stars honestly because of these factors). Those things aside, it is solid. Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles. I would highly recommend it to those inquiring about it, but acknowledge it is not for everyone. My friends who are hardcore photography nuts admit they are impressed with the Sony NEX 5n, but would never buy one. I am happy with it, and look forward to every chance to use it in the future.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amateur Photographer Review- Takes Wonderful Photos of Active Tots and Pets", "Author": "Passau", "ReviewID": "R15QR9BLK2B4I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I would like to start this review by saying that it is directed at amateur photographers. I did do a lot of research about this camera before I bought it but I am the type of photographer that is an amateur and keeps the camera set on auto (I have been meaning to take a photography course but haven't had the time yet). However, since I didn't read many amazon reviews directed at the true photography amateur, I thought I would provide an amateur's perspective in this review. So, this review is primarily directed at other amateurish photographers that want idiot proof quality photos of their kids or pets. In which case, I highly recommend this camera for the reasons below:1) Less bulky that DSLRs - It take amazingly crisp photos that almost have the quality of my DSLR, without the bulk. It fits right in my purse, unlike my DSLR, so I end up using it a lot more than my DSLR that I have to lug around in a separate camera bag. With two toddlers and an overstuffed diaper bag and purse, I usually don't have the desire to lug a huge camera bag around in addition to my plethora of other baby items. So, it is great that this camera is smaller and more portable than my DSLR, so I can just toss it in my purse and go. And since I can pack it easily with me I don't have to rely on poor quality cell phone photos when I want an impromptu photo of the kids when I am out and about.2) Takes rapid fire shots very easily - Unlike my DSLR, I don't have to hunt for a continuous mode setting to take rapid fire shots of my kids on this camera. Simply hold down the button that you push to take pictures and this camera automatically shoots off in rapid fire mode. If you are like me and are trying to shoot little kids and pets that are constantly in motion, you may only have a split second to capture a smile or a moment when your kids or pets are actually looking at the camera. So, I love it that this camera is completely idiot proof for taking awesome quality continuous shots.3) Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo. However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode. And If I do need to adjust the lighting or saturation of my pictures, I do so in a basic photo editing program like Picasa or Picmonkey. This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4) Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera. Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode. My apartment has little natural light and I have been very impressed at the quality of low light photos that it has produced.5) Video camera works great - you may have read that early models of the Sony NEX 5N had defective video cameras, but Sony has fixed this problem. I have been very impressed by the crispness of the videos that I have taken with this camera. Sure, you can get better quality video from a video camera or in some DSLR's but I am very satisfied with the quality of the videos that I have shot in bright and low light with this camera.One thing to consider, however, is that the Sony NEX 5N does not come with the electric viewfinder. I have heard that the electronic viewfinder (sold separately) for this camera is amazing but at $300 more it just hasn't been worth it for me to buy it. Instead, I would just upgrade to the NEX 7 or another Sony NEX model that comes with the electronic viewfinder. My only other complaint is that I can never get the flash to stay on the camera for long as it falls off easily. However, that hasn't been a big problem for me as I usually do not need the flash to take great photos, even in low light.Since I could never get the settings right on my DSLR to take great photos, the auto mode on the Sony NEX 5N has made it an amazing camera for me. It captures beautiful, crisp, quality images of my toddlers and pets in the most simple auto mode, which is perfect for me as a complete photography amateur. I enthusiastically give it five stars!", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good camera for what it does but frustrating limitations", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "R3L4ARWDI0NOEQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background: I am a hobbyist and not a pro - this reflects my limited level of understanding of photography which isn't as high as many other reviews.This is an excellent step up from a high-end point and shoot or a lower end DSLR. The camera takes beautiful photos and allows for some great effects within the camera if you don't want to edit your photo using PhotoShop or GIMP. The corners are sharp, center focus is quite clear, and the ISO settings are amazing. The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings. Photos taken in Program Auto, Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority are pretty nice and you have a wide variety of creative effects to use to improve your photos.The camera does have many frustrating limitations. In DSLRs switching to manual mode opens up a whole set of opportunities and challenges as with this camera but M mode on this camera is a pain. The following are the big problems:1. No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder. If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use. I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2. No aperture control ring - its tedious to change F-Stops and Shutter speed simultaneously through the control ring - also the previews of the aperture change is not as accurate as even a lower-end DSLR. My basic Canon DSLR offers far superior control.3. Changing ISO and white balance requires going through multiple steps and menus. This is especially frustrating with ISO given that one of the best features of this camera is its ISO capabilities.4. Your lens options are quite limited and pretty expensive. I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great. One of the challenges with adapters for this camera is its mirrorless nature - the sensor is directly visible and when you add an extra an extra half inch of space between the sensor and the end of the lens -it is hard to calibrate the adjustments required to get the right shots.I still give the camera 4 stars because you can take beautiful pictures with it. It is however not ideal if you are trying to improve your skills at exposure. I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "mine also has a CLICK NOISE problem!!!", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "RTR39I4LEKQHP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE (03/27/12):My replacement order came today.

Both of the cameras are not compact and they're not bulky enough to make me look like professional. I'm not a professional anyway. (:I finally decided to get the Sony NEX 5N due to its size and positive reviews on the web. I was worries about its size and lack of PASM button but it turns out to be so wonderful. When I first receive the camera I was like \"WTF\", why the body is so mall and the lens bigger than the body but once I play around with it for like a day, I start to fall in love with it. I took pictures for the girls and they was like \"What a cute little camera\" .^.^. I wish I have the white version body and white lenses....that would make this camera a beautiful toy. Well, not as beautiful as the NEX-7 but for the price, the NEX-5N is the most beautiful compact DSLR-like camera on the market with a APS-C sensor and full of features. Thumbs up for SONY on this one.Before I purchase this camera, I already tried both T3i and A65 and both of them are returned. I also compares to Fuji X10, GF3, G3, GH2, EP3, Nikon D5100. In my opinion, the NEX-5N beat them all in over-all features and price. It packed with 16.1MP APS-C sensor, can record full 1080p 60p/24p, full manual control, 10fps, touch screen, picture effects, fast start up time, super quiet and fast focus....and so on.Reason why I give it a 4 star instead of 5:I wish the body is a little wider taller than the lensNo standard hotshoeNo built in flash (It would be nice to make a camera a little wider and taller with built-in popup flash)No built in EVF (I careless about this because it will make the camera cost more, but its nice to implemented without to increase the price) :)No AF/MF button on the 18-55mm kit lensNo in-body Image Stabilizer like the Alpha Series (Why not SONY? Even P&S; cameras has it!)The camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied. (What a bummer!)Camera Menu is a little confusing for beginner. It doesn't make sense to have Camera and Setting separated. Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting. (But you will get used to it)No 3-way tilting like the A77. I wish SONY will have that as a standard design feature on all future NEX and Alpha Series.CLICKING NOISE issue when recording video (known issue and SONY will fix it for free, SONY will pay for all shipping/handling feesI GET SYSTEM ERROR SCREEN FLICKERING after taking a bunch of pictures continuously. Had to turn off and turn on again.Overall, I am HIGHLY recommended this camera to anyone looking to purchase a camera with DSRL-like image quality and ability to shoot 1080p 60p/24p video. (If you got money to burn, go for the NEX-7)Here are the images I took with my NEX-5N. All the pictures are taken in Auto mode: flickr dot com/vincentvinhP.S.

I do not say this half cocked, either.The proof is in my pudding. My shots came back INCREDIBLE. That dark, filmic look was there with the Sony, even more so than what I had thought only possible with a Canon.But how did this happen, how was it possible?I have no idea and I do not care. My Sony is my new best piece of gear, my ONLY...piece of gear for a camera.I can now concentrate on using this tool to make the films I prefer, not worrying about tech specs as I did for several months researching. Sony does it all. Full HD for 60fps, which was a big selling point for me. The kit lens is surprisingly awesome. The trick is to film things WORTH filming. It makes all the difference.

I sent it in for repair with the help of the geeks at BB only to have them call me a week later to tell me it couldn't be fixed and that I'd need to go into the store to pick out a new camera.  I ended up getting a closeout deal on a new Sony NEX-5n for 450 bucks, which is the camera I originally wanted back in July, but couldn't swallow the 700 dollar MSPR. For less than 10 bucks, I've ordered a M42 to E-mount adapter so that I can use some old Pentax Super Takumar glass that's been sitting around for more than 40 years!  Also, I'm pretty sure I'll end up getting the EVF attachment once it comes down in price a bit more, since getting a good manual focus in bright sunlight is darn near impossible on the otherwise awesome touchscreen display. Even when working normally, the GF-3's touchscreen was much harder to use than the NEX's - the difference was almost like using an old resistive type touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive one.

The NEX-5N does well at correcting these issues (disabled by default, you can change each specific setting to \"Auto\" because it isn't called \"Yes\"). However, because the camera must apply the correction upon pressing the button to take the photo, trying to do burst shots does no justice. If you want to take a photo during movie, forget it (as with the NEX-5). The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen. Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera). Here are improvements over the NEX-5 (although at times the autofocus still tends to be picky on the subject, which is normal--any camera does this when a close tree or plant is the focus instead of getting a clear shot of a distant building, for example)... (Two other cons will be mentioned.)Pros:- New sensor (AVCHD 2) brings improved low-light high ISO performance/quality, and a bit faster (?)- 1080p 60fps movie recording (still no 720p a stinker, but you still have VGA for DVD or Web use)- Lens correction settings (but forfeits burst shooting or snap-after-snap single shots as in a D/SLR), useful for photographing furniture, rooms, buildings, etc.- Faster burst-frame rate- 2 MP higher resolution (and better quality at that!); APS-C sensor size the same (crop factor = 1.6) (neutral comparison for sensor size improvement)- Same screen resolution (neutral comparison)Cons:- NEX-5N displays: \"Incompatible battery. Please use correct model.\" This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5. It makes no sense because the batteries are identical! (I did look thoroughly. However, the battery that gives this error on the camera had a bit of plastic near the connection terminals chipped off, but this shouldn't matter.)- Doesn't have Art filters and due for firmware update, if and when available (if I wanted to do artistic effects, use NEX-5 for that)For the battery and (still) quirky autofocus (hint--I bought the body only because the kit lens from the NEX-5 on the NEX-5N saved me $100, and so could you, if you don't plan to buy another lens at the time), this camera given 4 out of 5 stars. Yes, the clicking noise in the movie is annoying to many, but I don't really find it much of a nuisance. Think of a loose buckle or snap on your jacket flapping and hitting on the camera.

The lack of control on point and shoot cameras really got on my nerve, but I didn't have the money to drop on a full blown SLR.  When the price dropped on this, it was a must have for me.  There are alot of shooting modes and options as well as special effects if you really want to get creative.  Shooting and experimenting with shutter priority and aperture priority has been great and still takes a minimal amount of skill, but you can get much more from your shots.  It shoots so fast, just click and try the next setting up or down for aperture, shutter or ISO and then click again to see how it affects the picture (keeping in mind the camera will automatically adjust the other two for the correct amount of light)!  So far, the freedom to set shutter speed for motion shots has been the most fun.  The quality of the low light shots is also great!  There are also alot of built in help menus and tips, so if you are coming up from a point and shoot, it will help in your transition.Just FYI, I was concerned with the infamous clicking during video, but mine did not have that issue.

So far I am loving it. This is my first real venture into something more than a point and shoot (though I did have a very short stint with a Rebel a year or so ago but felt overwhelmed.) I love the size and general simplicity of the NEX-5N as well as the ability to dig in deeper to the world of photography. I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it. I like the user interface and the touch screen is a nice addition. I like the fact that there is an on screen explanation for what a function does. It helps to keep this novice on track. On the surface this camera has a simplicity I enjoy but it certainly goes much deeper than what I am used to. Digging in and really learning the ins and outs of the camera is part of the fun for me. I love the fact that you can change the lens making it a very flexible camera. You can't beat the size of the body. It is nice and compact. I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue. It helps with keeping the camera as compact as possible. Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too. I have taken just a few videos though and sadly the click sound does occur what panning. Fortunately Sony has addressed the issue with a fix and I feel they did it promptly and as well as they could. I work in manufacturing and completely understand when something goes wrong on a product. For the price I can understand consumer frustration, but I think it is disingenuous to give a one star rating to this camera when the video function is only one part of it. Yes it was not good for Sony to let this issue slip by but stuff happens and they dealt with it promptly.I only gave the camera 4 stars for a few reasons... The clicking issue (which is being dealt with), my novice skill (I've not even brushed the surface of what the camera can do and I have little to compare to except a point and shoot), and it is a bit pricy especially when you start adding on all the extras.I do love this camera and look forward to many good years (and photos) ahead.

I got it at the end of Jan 2012. I know about the problem before I ordered but thought that the odds are very low. TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping. Sent it for repair to Laredo, TX and got it back in a week. The result is a \"IMPROVEMENT\" (read the word). Hopefully it lasts.2) I don't understand this reseller concept with Sony, not that I don't like resellers. Got my camera thro buy.com/Cameta Camera. They are the only game online when I ordered. However, my LCD does not have the colored sticker glued to it. Nor I see any colored tag talking about APS-C sensor tied to the camera. Look at \"unboxing the nex-5n\" videos on youtube, to understand what i'm taking about. Unless proven otherwise, I suspect it is a repackaged new item sent to me. Not a good feeling after paying full price 699$. Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta. I will have to shy away from resellers in future. Something is fishy here and Sony should also provide enough of their product to the Tier 1 online vendors who are trustable.Watch out for this:1. I also bought 16mm lens. Like most reviewers said, the IQ is so so so so, well let me say it, not \"PRIME\" quality. Buy it only if you want jacketable camera. For all other routine purposes for a normal user, 18-55mm kit lens will deliver the same results.2. Now that i'm finding out, consider 4/3's. You will find many well rounded alternatives which are way cheaper. Don't just get carried away with a slightly bigger sensor and ignore the full package.Finally, all above things aside, the picture quality and some features like HDR/DRO, Panaroma, etc. are good. Its fast to operate.  I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.  I did setup the custom buttons which make the usage easy. Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.

Amazon waited 'til 10:30pm on the last day possible to ship with Super Saver. Maybe this was a fluke or maybe they are trying to drive up demand for their upgraded shipping. You be the judge. Anyway camera showed up, needed a firmware upgrade which was super easy and I am in love. Very smart auto mode. JPEG is fine. I dont shoot raw unless I plan on editing in Photoshop. Took this ice climbing (with the fixed 1.8/50mm which I love) and portrait-style/climber in action pictures were excellent. Color representation was literally perfect. I am totally giddy when using this camera because my pictures end up looking like something out of an outdoor magazine. I dont shoot indoor or very much nighttime so keep that in mind.Bottom line: If you are a consumer with a normal salary, shoot outdoors (maybe indoors too but I cant vouch for that), not a professional photographer and upgrading from a smart point and shoot (like an S100, G12, etc) or an older DSLR you will absolutely love this camera... even with its somewhat dumb menu system. I do recommend reading the reviews for the different lenses and picking one of those based on your shooting stlye instead of the kit lens.Other: Video is awesome IMO but you can hear the focusing components of the camera in the audio (quiet situations and not the infamous clicking). I never expected this camera to record great audio since its a camera not a camcorder. I own a Blue Mikey for my iPod and I will use that for my audio recording if I want to do some knockoff Discovery Channel HD Sunrise type footage.Still reading this?

Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R158HOJKKQB7BB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I desperately want to love this camera based on its image and video quality alone. However, the lack of a mode dial and limited buttons might leave those migrating from either a point-and-shoot or DSLR very frustrated. One example is the HDR mode which takes three quick pictures (low-, mid-, and high-tones) and combines them into one. With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial). With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode). Yikes! And there are other examples.Having said that, there's plenty of benefits for both point-and-shoot fans (image quality, very good auto mode, fast performance) and DSLR fans (image quality, size, features). However, do yourself a favor and try before you buy (spend at least 10 minutes trying a variety of features and creative modes). The user interface is cumbersome and not for everyone. If you've read the DPReview and CNET reviews, the truth is somewhere inbetween the two.UPDATEThe image quality, speed and low-light sensitivity continue to impress. Yes, it's a hassle to switch between modes due to lack of physical buttons and there's no built-in flash. However, the iAuto mode does a great job in most situations and I can program a few of my favorites to soft buttons and the low-light performance means I use flash significantly less than I did with lesser cameras (like the Canon S-series).

The lightweight and features noted were enough to convince me that it could serve as a good back up and after reading the technical reviews posted by many I made my choice favoring the Sony over a Lumix with comparable features. Obviously Sony has concentrated on their electronics expertise vs. camera technology in building this unit and it requires a learning curve in order to master the (simple) yet bewildering menu system. That being said, I have now given the unit trials under most ordinary conditions and find that unless you have a perfectly lit environment most images are either too dark or over exposed at the Auto, P and A settings. Also, the use of the small flash unit tends to produce \"flare\" or \"burnt\" casting and has a range limitation (expected) but flares within the 6' range. The mounting for the flash unit is also prone to coming loose and requires constant attention before any use. The LCD display while a good feature is prone to fogging and unless used in semi-darkness or low natural light will not provide enough detail for optimal viewing and I wish that I had waited for the NEX 7 with optical viewfinder. The Sweep Panorama feature is great, but again, unless there is optimal lighting at ALL ranges the resulting image will be disappointing. This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings. Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
