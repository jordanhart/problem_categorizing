{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great camera amazing price", "Author": "Amy Dewan", "ReviewID": "RSDM9KJ9VE93A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera and so far its amazing, especially for the price. It takes great pictures with flash and has pretty good stabalization for pictures without flash, although sometimes pictures are still a little blurry without flash. The main perk about this camera is its user friendliness and the features. If you like having fun with pictures, this is a good camera to have. It includes the option to take panoramas with Pictbridge, and you can see the panorama right on your screen. Also, it has features to take black and white, sepia, inverted, and even red, blue, and green tinted photos. This reminds me a lot of the lomography color splash that I spent more money on last christmas, that's not even digital. This camera also has the long exposure option, as well as short. Also, it has the option most more expensive cameras have that takes a series of photos, so you can catch something on the move. It takes some exploring on the menus and through manual to figure all this out, but its well worth it. It's a great point and shoot, as well as a camera you can have a little fun with.The only other thing..make sure you buy a memory card with the camera. It doesn't come with one, and although it can take one or two pictures without it (you'll want to take more obviously), its also really slow without a card.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera rocks!", "Author": "Randall D. Lind", "ReviewID": "RL8D3FV446DFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for Christmas my is blue which is my favorite color. I have Cerebral Palsy and let me tell you the anti-shake built into this is a god send.I can shake,rattle and click and still get a perfect picture. The battery life is beyond awesome! My old Kodak 2mp would die after 10-15 pictures. This on 35+ and it is still fully charge.I can't be any more happy with this then that. It sucks to be addicted just to have battery suck the fun out. So far so good. You need a Camera what are you waiting for? Click buy!", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poloroid has permanently LOST my business due to THIS Camera", "Author": "Jennifer Hauserman", "ReviewID": "RFL47OE9K4IX6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, I bought this camera for my 10 year old son for Christmas.  He used it a total of 3 TIMES and the LCD screen burst! I called Poloroid to complain about the camera's obvious defect, and request that they honor the warantee, and they refused!  I was told that ANY problem with the screen is automatically deemed user damage, and not covered under warrantee.  They apparently are so confident in their manufacturers that they believe that there could not possibly any defect in the screen.  Even after I told them that before the screen burst we got an error message.  So buyers beware, if you have trouble with the screen, Poloroid won't cover it.  I'm so totally not EVER buying another Poloroid camera.The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to in order to post this review!", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a camera", "Author": "PewPewPew", "ReviewID": "R1X1SKZ4VG1HZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a digital camera.
