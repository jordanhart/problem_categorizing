We figured that if a W10 is this great that a W80 would be even better but we were sadly mistaken after receiving our W80 and taking a few photos. At first, when all the photos we took turned out grainy I figured it was the settings that needed to be changed.As a military photojournalist, I shoot daily with a Nikon D3, I know how to change settings and reduce the ISO to make the photo less grainy - and even after I exhausted all changes to the settings, the photos were still unimpressive. We went outside thinking that more lighting would mean better focus and better photos - but even they were a little soft and not that great.I  might recommend this for the outdoorsy type but for someone like my husband and I who are looking for a point-and-shoot camera that takes impressive photos (without fumbling through settings all the time) it was not for us.

It can take AMAZING shots if you take a little time to learn the settings.  Manual macro shots of up-close items look terrific, and the panorama feature on this camera stitches separate pictures together better than my old Kodak 1063 did.The underwater shots look pretty good, especially if taken on days with sufficient sunlight, and I'm not seeing any signs of the camera leaking.Overall I'm really pleased with this little camera.  It has a lot of neat features if you just take the time to learn about them.

But I am sending it back because it won't even take normal pictures accurately without graininess, blurriness and movement.  Also, the delay is far too long, and image stabilization does not work accurately.  Additionally, if subjects are moving, it's quite difficult to get a reasonable picture in low-ish light.  To be fair, I tried a variety of mode settings including auto and a variety of manual settings, and frankly my iPhone took better pictures (without a flash!).  In fact, the best pictures I took were in \"green mode\", and these were not really comparable to a generic 3-5 year old digital camera.Maybe this camera has a niche use for underwater/etc only, but I had planned on taking \"normal\" pictures of reasonable quality with it as well, and I just couldn't find a way for this to work, so this is a non-starter for me.I should have waited for the reviews to come out before taking the plunge:see [...] for comparisons to D10 and TS1.

I know someone with a W30 who is very happy with his, so I figured this would be much better.  So far, I'm very disappointed.  I'm comparing it to my Canon SD850 by shooting macro, interior and exterior scenes. I have left the settings in auto mode and set it to record highest quality.  The W80 produces very noisy images.  Flash results seem to be a bit erratic. Very poor image quality in low-light. Side-by-side photo comparisons on-screen show better images with my Canon.I also figured that since there is no moving lens, the W80 would have excellent battery life.  Canon battery is 1120-mAh and W80 is only 680-mAh.  The actual battery life is commensurately poor.  I can get by on a weekend trip with lots of photos with only a single battery in my Canon, but I'm sure I would need to take two or three with the Pentax.I really wanted this camera to work out, but I'm about to send it back.

All the reviews for low light imaging were bad. But I needed a camera with the ability to take shots at a specified time interval (a great, rare feature) and to do so in low light.First, the interval feature is worth the price of the camera. I can have the camera take a shot every minute or 5 minutes or whatever I set and catch 1,000 images. When I have speaking engagements or teach a day class, I can set up the camera in a corner and let it shoot every minute. At the end of the day, I can have 300 or 500 images or more to review. I always get some good ones. And, if you want to do time lapse, you can get really cool stuff with this camera.But, if I'm giving a lecture, I can't have a flash going off every minute. So I set the ISO at 400 and hope for the best.Bottom line? Great shots, even in low light. You just have to get the settings, of which there are hundreds possible, right!Battery life? Look, it's a waterproof camera and it fits in the palm of your hand. Yes, if it took 4 AAs it could last longer. But the battery is great for such a small battery. It really is. If you know about this stuff, I have 15 digital cameras, you'll know this is great camera for the price. Get a spare battery or two and an external charger.

This camera is inarguably durable and waterproof, and it has some very cool features such as great macro capability and time-lapse photography as well as motion video and 5X optical zoom. It goes where I wouldn't want to take my DSLR's -- that is the main point -- and that will be almost exclusively outdoors in full daylight albeit sometimes in inclement conditions. The question then becomes, \"Is this camera capable of delivering acceptable image quality under the conditions of use and for the intended purpose?\"The answer to that question is \"Yes.\", even \"Hell, yes!\".If you want to look at a 100% crop of a 4000 X 3000 pixel image, yes, you will see noise and even at ISO 100. But I don't intend to print posters with these images. I will be resizing them for display on the internet, my computer, and digital picture frames. Moreover, in the unlikely event I need to radically crop an image, I've found that my digital image editing software's noise reduction function does a great job of eliminating the noise. Ya, it's an extra step, but so what if you wouldn't have been able to capture the image in the first instance???While some have decided to focus on the negatives, the unique niche this camera fills for me greatly overshadows the compromises the design entails. And by the way, I like the yellow accent color on this particular model too !So there, naysayers ! :-P For me, this camera is perfekt.====================================Further clarificaton on the noise \"issue\". Some of the photography blog image comparisons are not really apples-to-apples: I've seen a higher percentage of high ISO shots for the W80 than the Canon and Olympus alternatives (at twice the price), but when you make a direct comparison of 100% crops at equivalent ISO, I'd rate Pentax in between Canon and Olympus. In any case, bottom line: This camera is not a DSLR. With any smaller CCD and high pixel density, noise is inevitable; it is a matter of degree. If you don't want to deal with noise, buy a DSLR.But, if you check for noise reduction software (\"noiseware\", to coin a phrase) online, you will find several offerings that do an incredible job, some with free versions for non-batch processing, and an inexpensive price for large batch, automatic processing. Using the automatic mode with a \"noiseware\" program, I've had amazing results without significant loss of sharpness from my W80 images, even at higher ISO levels. I just routinely batch-process everything I shoot with this camera, and end up with images that are far superior to any other as-captured compact images I've seen on-line.In summary, although noise is the most prominent objection to this design in virtually every review, you can address that perfectly well, in my amateur opinion, via a software solution and take advantage, thereby, of the many other advantages this camera offers in comparison with its competitors, including its lower price.

Maybe the main purpose was for underwater use but it would have been wonderful if underwater and out of water photos could be taken with great quality. All photos also appear washed out/faded.

I was so dissatisfied with the camera, that I decided to take the rest of the pictures with my Iphone camera, with shockingly better pictures!I thought to myself, maybe it's me, so I read the manual again, figured out some things that could be improved, and tried it out on new years eve...the flash is too strong, the images come out blurred, all and all I was disappointed.I really wanted to like this camera, and it takes beautiful outside daytime photos, but if you happen to wish to take any sort of indoor/night time photos, you'll get better results with your cell phone camera, even the god awful Iphone 3g camera.Pentax, I am very dissapointed, and I would sell this camera back if I thought I wasn't ripping people off.So, all and all if your main objective is to take outside daytime/underwater photos this is is your camera, any thing else than that, you'll be greatly disappointed.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Fun Camera to have", "Author": "drpret \"Preetham\"", "ReviewID": "R3DI8L6HU40W60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a second one to compliment me DSLR, and it has proved to be very useful.

Very happy.  W80's shutter response is good, battery resting retention impressive, photo quality fine for me.  Still need to play with the settings, read manual, and truly test it out in multiple environments, but 100% satisfied at this point.  Nice design touch is the battery compartment \"lock by default\".The selling point for me with the W80 is weather resistance.  That is why I bought my other Optio.When I researched that one, it was for my first digital camera (latecomer).  Could see other digital cameras might provide better picture quality/performance/etc but just seemed dumb (for me) to spend money on a camera I couldn't safely use in the rain, on a boat, in the snow, etc.  Out of the water-resistant choices available, I risked it on the Optio.  Not cheap.  Especially compared to non-weatherproof choices.  But, turned out to be a good choice for me.  See no reason to change brands now.  Bought two batteries, extra SD cards, & have never had a problem during casual/general use.  (My point & shoot 35mm before digital was the weather-resistant Olympus.)My older Optio is still working fine & taking great pictures (to my level of discernment) as long as I account for the slow shutter response.  Shutter lag has been my only complaint with the older Optio.  A pain, especially for action shots, but balanced out by the positive features, especially weather resistance.  (And it caught some beautiful picture detail, really.)On the W80 I was sucked in by newer technology & more than twice the megapixels, with the security of known manufacturer/model line.  The W80's shutter speed & other features seem good to me.  Looking forward to getting to know its capabilities over time.  From the some of the other reviews, sounds like this camera hasn't made everyone happy; taking those comments under consideration but not worrying about it.

There are a lot of settings.  There's even a \"pet\" setting, and you have to choose dog or cat and the animals color/shade (black, white, or grey) I'm not sure what difference this makes, unless it has to do with a tracking mode.  I've taken pictures of the dog on different settings and they all seem to come out the same.The video is pretty cool for device thats main function is camera.  It saves in AVI format.  We went to a concert and I used it in the dark to capture video and without any source of light the vid wasn't bad.  It has a heavy red color to it- actually the video is composed of shades of red and black- but I'm impressed considering the lack of light.  Even cooler is that on the camera itself you can edit the video, and go frame by frame to find the perfect still shot to save as a jpeg picture from the avi video. Each time you save a picture from video, you have to start at the beginning of the video again if you want to save a different still shot, so this can take a lot of time if the video is a longer one.  The concert video had good sound quality, in my opinion.  Over all, I love the video this camera takes.As for the picture quality, this camera confuses me.  I have an SLR digital (canon) and that has me spoiled.  I wanted a waterproof camera for snorkling, and the size of this camera makes it an easy tag along for every day things.  I have not figured out how to take good pictures inside.  Very close shots come out crystal clear, but the flash sends out a red light before flashing that usually means a subject is closing their eyes as the pic is taken. On the subject of closed eyes, this camera has a sensitive closed eye mode that warns you when a subject's eyes are closed, or even half closed, or if a shadow falls across the eye area making the eyes dark.  That is an interesting feature.I have not taken any macros to see if there is noise in them, but most of the indoor pics have a lot of noise.  You need a program to clean it up, and adobe 8 seems to make the pics look a little blurry when you clean the noise.  Not good for anything more than 4x6 photo album shots.The delay between snapping a shot and actually taking the picture seems a little slow, and even on high ISO you seem to get blurry pics when the subject moves, even slightly.  The pixel tracking mode is nice because it does correct alot of the blur, at least for slight movements, but makes the delay a little longer.I have tried the kids mode,sport mode, and even continous shot/burst mode and none of these reduce blur inside for when a subject moves (who's kids sit perfectly still for a picture?) Unless, as I have said, you are close to your subject.  If you are far enough away to have a full body in your indoor pictures, there's noise or blur or both.  Adjusting the light settings doesn't seem to help.  Sometimes you get lucky if you just leave the camera on green mode and let it do what it wants.And the zoom- looks like optical and has a mark on the zoom indicator showing when you switch over to digital, but it does not act like a true optical.  The closer you zoom, the more noise you have, even if you are using the \"optical\" zoom.Outdoor pics seem to make all the noise/blur issues disappear, but I have not used this camera outdoors much.Over all, for the price, I like this camera.  You really need to experiment to know what it is capible of so that you do not get disappointed, and you get comfortable with knowing which settings to use when.  I have taken many good indoor pics with it, but also some not so good pictures.  It's not a good camera for special evens when you ask someone else to take a picture for you(indoors), because most likely they won't get a good shot because they don't know how the camera works. Make sure to tell others the camera has a delay, so they don't snap a picture of you then move right way, causing blur.This will not replace my slr for anything other then those times when I don't want to drag a bulky slr around, or am worried about water damage.

I am surprised that this camera actually made it into the market place because the photo quality is just horrific! In just about any lighting, this camera manages to get it all wrong. Too much light comes in, over exposing some photos, some pictures don't allow enough light, other photos are too grainy, fuzzy and if that is not enough to dissuade a consumer, there is problem of the battery going weak after just a few short uses.

Durability:  I destroyed my previous sony digital at my cousins wedding and have done far worse to this Pentax with no damage.  I have have had this on two water-ski trips, a day trip to Tipi Hedron's wild cat sanctuary, and a trip to DisneyWorld and SeaWorld, and an ocean beach day.  It survived all without a hitch, including taking pictures and video on rollercoasters and while getting ejected from tube behind a boat into river (hard skip and landing in water).  It did just fine in the pouring rain at SeaWorld.2.  Pictures:  Some people have had problems with pictures, that has not been my experience.  I was able to get good pictures and decent video.  I'm an amateur and used firework mode at DisneyWorld and got great pictures.3.  Timer:  The timer feature worked great for group shots at Christmas, plenty of time for the person taking to get into the picture and good warning that it is about to take.4.  SD Card:  It does not seem to have any problems with any SD cards.  I have put in small slow ones and a new high capacity (16GB) Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] and not had any problems.Here are the things that are difficult with this camera:1.  Redeye:  This is the most common problem.  There is a full flash then a very long pause so people always start moving.  This also can cause the camera person will start moving.  It's more of an annoyance, because you end up retaking the picture.2.  Video:  This is Not a video camera.  It does decent on the full HD videos up to a point.  If there is a lot of movement or you want a long video, you probably need a real video camera.3.  Battery:  The Battery is reversible 180 degrees, but only works in one orientation, so if you put the battery in and it is backward, you will think the battery is dead.  I also recommend a second battery.4.  Settings:  There are a lot of settings, so you have to pay attention if somebody else used the camera before you.5.  Audible shutter click:  There may be a way to change this, but the shutter sound is quiet, so it is not always obvious when/if the picture took.6.  Flash reset:  It can take a few seconds before another picture can use the flash and the camera will often take the picture without the flash without warning.  This is probably better than not taking the picture if the flash isn't ready since one can delete it, but it was different.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio W80 - Successful cruise pictures!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1K9VVU8PNH7V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While researching waterproof and underwater cameras for our cruise, I was not very impressed by any of the options available. All the options in my price range had issues. I selected the Pentax Optio W80 because of the feature set, including using standard SD and SDHC cards and the overall reviews I found. I noticed that most people either loved or hated their choice, regardless of which choice they made, but this camera had more positive reviews than negative.Having said that, I found that the speed of the capture was delayed a bit as expected, but not as bad as I had feared. Most reviews stated this and every professional review confirmed that underwater cameras are slower to accommodate the underwater image processing. I did not have any issues with leaking or damage to the camera after using it in the ocean. The camera did not descend more than 5 feet underwater.The colors were better than my wife's $1,500 DSLR and most of the images were as good or better quality. I found a few low-light situations with the automatic setting where the images were grainy or blurry, but a combination of manual settings and/or a tripod overcame these issues. This really comes down to knowing how to use the camera. Of course, the lens flexibility and detailed settings of the DSLR is where the comparison is lost.The battery lasted for nearly a full day excursion (8+ hours) with frequent playback and minimal video. I tried to turn off the camera whenever I was not using it so the self-timed shutoff did not activate and the camera was not on for the full time. I cannot even guess as to the total length of \"on\" time, but it met my needs and the battery recharged within an hour.

Goodenow", "ReviewID": "R1DBYYJRHCFZ9K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "By way of background I do semi-pro photography (with Olympus dslr equipment)and because I travel and also do a lot of canoeing am always fiddling with small cameras going back through generations of Olympus point and shoots and now a little Canon A550, a superb Panasonic Lumix ZS1 and the latest, the W80. I got the Pentax in part because of its price and in part because I needed something waterproof. Oh, and before I got into digital I was an avid Pentax fan.Though I realize the camera has been supplanted by the W90 the price of the 80 and its many attractive features will doubtless attract many buyers. Hence, what I have concluded after a pretty good workout over the past couple of days:First, the camera is a pretty erratic performer, certainly the weakest of my three current point and shoots out of the box. Take two photos of the same subject and, whoops, you can get two different exposures, either in terms of color cast, which can be pretty weird, and actual focus. This is particularly true when using the anemic flash. When the camera is spot on the results are really very fine, particularly at ISO200 and lower. I found its image stabilization feature to be very weak. On the positive side, I got some beautiful macro results. I split shooting between the fully auto feature and one that provides for various adjustments -- sharpness, contrast, saturation and exposure compensation. Frankly, I found relatively little difference between them. The auto feature doesn't hold a candle to the ZS1's though it will probably satisfy most users.My overall conclusion on image quality is that if one knows how to do basic post-processing most of the images coming out of this camera can be made to look extremely good, with the exception of low light ones that are beset by noise -- at around ISO 64 and 100 photos are pretty free of it. As a tip, I use the night feature when light starts to dim; it seems to cut noise.In terms of control, I find the menu system somewhat confusing and utterly too complex. People who buy a camera for use in bad weather, under water, etc. shouldn't have to dig too deep to access exposure compensation, for example. The tiny buttons are just that. A tad too tiny for anyone with large hands. One tip is to use the delayed shutter release, set at 2 seconds, when shooting landscapes or other stable subjects. That gives you a chance to hold the camera very steady as it fires. Makes a real difference.My sense is that the W80 is a victim of the megapixel race. Its tiny sensor just has to work too hard, though certainly it doesn't hold a candle to the ones in my Canon or Lumix, which are equally small cameras. I think the overall sweet spot for digital photography as practiced by 95% of users is somewhere around 7 megapix, which would permit very large prints (I did some commercial posters with my old 5 megapix Oly 5060, a magnificent camera). So, I set the W80 to shoot at 7meg; it will also do 5meg. I need to test that out and see if noise is reduced at that setting.The build quality seems very good, though I was flummoxed a couple of times when I inserted the battery incorrectly -- why Pentax lets that happen is another mystery. Its nice to have the zoom range, though I had some focusing issues at full telephoto.To conclude, if you like to post-process with Photoshop or another program, you can certainly get extremely good results from this camera. Otherwise, it is simply too uneven to assure the kind of quality one has come to expect from digital cameras as costly as this was originally. If you want something to throw in a backpack or in the back of your boat its fine, though I would take a good look at the Canon and Panasonic offerings. I sense that both of these companies have taken engineering and customer needs more seriously. Certainly it provides for lots of noise reduction and other post processing practice.------Update:I am getting to really like the camera, though I am not changing my rating and comments about complexity and the need to post process. But having set the default to do the 2 second time release I am getting consistently better photos, even with flash. It feels like the camera is taking a little more time to get itself ready -- or it gives me time to really hold steady. The results are far more consistent in terms of sharpness and exposure and, maybe it is my imagination, but they seem to have less noise. In fact at anything below ISO100 the results are clean enough out of the box for large prints. So, it is worth fiddling around, practicing and truly understanding both weaknesses and capabilities. Oh, and reducing resolution to 7mp makes for improvement in noise. As I said above, 7mp is about all one ever needs for non-professional purposes.Feels to me like a firmware update would fix a lot of problems, but obviously Pentax has chosen to move on to a new model.

I purchased it, based on reviews, thinking that I was making a sacrifice in picture quality, especially in low light settings. I am very pleased that this camera has a lot more versatility than I originally expected. If left on the default settings, yes, the pictures come out a bit noisy in low light, but if the ISO is dropped down and the camera is placed steadily to avoid blur during a longer exposure time, it does well. I prefer flash-free shots when I can get them, and I have even taken some shots that I really like, indoors and flash-free with this little camera. Another thing to keep in mind that I've noticed is sometimes a shot looks a lot noisier on the little built-in LCD screen than it will on the computer, so that isn't always a good judge! I have not printed any images yet, so I'm not sure how the quality will be there. There are also a lot of fun built-in editing tools, like image filters, red-eye removal, and some silly frames (my 5-year-old thinks these are hilarious). So even when I get a shot that is so-so, I find I can doctor it just a little using the built-in filters and end up with an image that I love.Another thing folks mentioned was battery life, but I am getting more than a day of shooting (and that is with me experimenting, so I've been taking lots and lots of pictures), and using the camera for picture editing (another really cool feature). To me that's plenty of use on a battery, but I suppose it is a personal preference thing. I do have a back-up, which makes life easier, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary.Sure, it is no SLR, but I think it performs great considering a)the cost, b)the compact design, and c)the fact the it is marketed as a weather resistant camera, not necessarily as a quality camera.

They are very simple and easy to use underwater and take good to excellent quality underwater photos depending on lighting/water clarity/+.  I average 225 underwater photo shots per dive, that's when the battery becomes @98 % depleted(camera is turned off after each photo taken).  The camera setting is at 1024 pixels + maximum picture quality, which seems adequate for viewing on the computer/online.  When the photo is enlarged/zoomed in/printed, that's when the higher megapixels are better and recommended, in my opinion. The 1st camera developed a moisture leak after its 6th dive. It was sent to the Pentax repair shop in Arizona,USA for a free repair,(I pay $ shipping to AZ, they sent it back free shipping via UPS)under Pentax warranty.  2nd camera sent for repair of  \"internal failure\"(everything stopped working)during its 7th dive with No moisture leakage showing at this time on second camera.  The 1st camera which was serviced for moisture leakage developed \"internal failure\" same as 2nd camera, on its second dive after being returned to me.  Both cameras were never dropped or subjected to blasts of water/waves/shaking. The depth of thesecameras usage/photos taken was not in excess of the 16'recommended by Pentax.  I'm currently waiting for the return from Pentax repair, these(2) W80's .  If they repair them to \"good as new\" condition,we may be doing a lot of shipping and repairing till the warranty expires.I like these W80's and wish they would last longer for me.  * @ 1,300/1,500  underwater photos, then failures of each camera, this seems to be their functional limit with my usage.  **  Both W80 cameras make sounds underwater when,  turning it on + depressing button 1/2way for auto focus + when picture is  taken/flash.  This scares some fish and sea creatures away when they are close or sensitive to foreign sounds.  UPDATE:  Received repaired cameras,  on the first dive(since repaired), camera #2  malfunctioned  AGAIN !  9 underwater  photos and then it acquired the same \"internal failure\" it was sent in to repair.

But low-light (high ISO) is a problem for the high dollar DSLRs. There is a setting on W80 besides the pixel setting that affects quality. It makes a sharper picture, but uses more memory. No problem, with an 8GB chip, I can shoot about 2,000 before I run out of memory. It really does make the picture sharper.I used a card reader to get the files into my computer. I like having a $10 card reader + regular USB cable instead of the $200 camera + proprietary USB cable for that purpose.The camera makes JPGs for stills and AVIs for movies.

I compared pictures from this camera and my (non-waterproof) Panasonic FX-35 camera and the results were astounding. At first I thought perhaps the screen on this camera wasn't as good or something but then as soon as I loaded test pictures from both cameras on my computer I immediately returned this camera. Either this camera has awful image quality or the FX-35 has incredible image quality, or both.

Chin", "ReviewID": "R2WLZWC1P1TPDD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I was shopping for a waterproof camera, the important things to me were submersible depth, good image quality, size, and of course cost.  I had an Olympus stylus 720 before and it was only submersible for 10ft.  I really don't need more than 15ft as I do not go in water deeper than that unless I'm scuba diving; and at that point the highest available at 33ft won't do you much good.  So I was really excited about the W80 since it seemed to have met all of my needs; the depth was 16ft, on paper the image quality was good, it was compact, and at around $180... it was a great deal.  Also, let me tell you that I've done some comparing between the Sony TX5, Olympus Stylus 6020 and 8010, Pentax W80 and W90, Casio, and the Panasonic TS2;  the only thing I really didn't do was take an actual picture with each of these.The first couple of pictures I took to test the camera when I received the W80 came out a little blurry on the screen.  I thought it was actually the screen because it looks a little pixelated to begin with but when I transferred the pictures to my computer they were pretty bad.  No matter what I did to change the settings, I couldn't get the camera to take clear pictures.  The only thing I would say is that outdoor pictures are MUCH better than those taken indoors with or without flash.  The pictures were super fuzzy and images seem soft.  Needless to say I returned the camera and opted for the Olympus 6020 which had MUCH better quality images.
