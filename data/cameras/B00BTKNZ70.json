It is small and slim, but with a nice big lcd screen.  The controls are easy to use, except that I wish the on/off button was a tad larger.  Picture quality is fine.  I also enjoy the hd video capabilty.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with Great Features", "Author": "Ashton Jah \"ashtonjah96\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3SOK6KGFLGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

The sales person made me aware that I needed to purchase the memory card separately.  So even for $89.99 at Walmart, it was still a great deal even having to purchase the memory card separately for $17 bucks.  This is actually a really fantastic camera.  I own a Canon that is of similar quality, however, the Samsung has more features for a better price.  Now I will be purchasing a second one for my son for Christmas through Amazon because I'm confident of the quality and the reliability of Samsung.  Amazon's price is also cheaper for the same camera sold at Walmart.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent little camera, high quality.", "Author": "david m bencic", "ReviewID": "R3VPX8SKJG75TY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got one from W..... for $79.  If you want a thin camera to put in your purse or shirt pocket, this is nice.  Photo quality is excellent, video quality is excellent, good sound too.  Here are my comments that may help you:  Flash takes 3 seconds to charge up after each flash.  You need to go to a few steps to turn flash on-off but no big problem.  I leave it on fill-in all the time.  No flash is almost the same time between pictures, 2-3 seconds on normal mode.  Shutter time is fast after you push the button, no significant delay.  If you press it slightly, it will focus, then when you are ready, press it down and it is almost instant.  The 2 INCH macro is great, can see fibers in the paper or cloth.  Focusing is fast.  In AF auto focus, it constantly searches and focuses so I like to keep it in P program mode then it only focuses when you partly press the shutter.  Uses the same mini plug and charger as my LG phone and charges on USB ports.  Includes a charger and USB cord.  The charger can power any USB device too.  Fits nice in a zip lock snack baggie if you will get wet.  HINTS:  Do NOT buy a red one, the white symbols and words on the red dials are hard to read.  When doing video, do not move or pan the camera, hold it still and let the subjects move or pan REAL slow  (true for any camera).  If you move the camera and pan, it tries to stay in focus and things get blurred some, if your subject is a kid and you pan to the next kid, it will refocus on the space between them then blurr the kids.  Not the camera's fault.  Yes, I would recommend this camera but not red.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera at a good price.", "Author": "Richard Tauer", "ReviewID": "R2597YGEKGA64R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is very compact, has a good lens, and it is easy to see images on the screen even in bright light.
