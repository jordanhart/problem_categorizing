I have been an avid film SLR user for many years.  I must say I was very skeptical about buying a digital point and shoot camera.  Let me explain why I bought it.  My father, who lives 2 hours away, was recently diagnosed with cancer, and has not been able to see our 2 week old newborn son.  We also have a 3 year old son.  When I found this camera, at such a low price, I figured I would give it a try, and if I didn't like it, I would simply return it.  I took a few test shots inside and outside, under different lighting conditions, and took them to my local Target and had 4x6 prints made to see how well they turned out.  I must honestly say that both my husband and I were truly impressed and surprised at the quality of the prints we received back.  They were very true to life, and the colors and the clarity were outstanding from this little 4 mp camera.  I am also happy with the fact that this camera can shoot short videos WITH SOUND, which can be very hard to find in this price range.  Now I can send my family updated pictures, daily, of our children, as well as short videos.  I would recommend this camera to anyone!", "Date": "June 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good for outside pictures -  Not the best for indoor use.", "Author": "Jon Smith \"http://www.thecdsuperstore.com\"", "ReviewID": "RVBID4FTVSK1M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Complaints:1. Don't buy this camera if you take mostly indoor pictures! - dim pictures-regardless of the settings. We have compared this Camera to three other digital cameras  for indoor pictures - it's not very good under average to poor lighting conditions. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 highest) -  I rate camera about a 3 or 4 for indoor use. We are returning the camera for a refund because of this problem.2 The Digimax 430  takes only  two AA batteries, when it should probably have been designed to take 4 AA batteries - so the battery life is rather short (particularly in video mode) We were using only the regular 'Duracell' Alkaline batterys for all out photo tests - So you may be able to do better with a longer lasting type.Good Points:In all fairness, the outdoor shots were very good - stills & video.The craftsmanship and design of the camera body is very good.The optical zoom worked well and was clear and in focus.The video mode worked  real good - but did drain the batteries a bit faster.The sound and mike pickup was remarkably good(using video) for such a small camera.The Menu and controls are easy to use and well thought out.The Camera case is nice and also has some soft padding.The packing, manual, software and cables were satisfactory.(Separate manuals, one in English, other foreign)Summery:Good for outside pictures and video - nice design, very small size - not the best for indoor use.", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Even better price", "Author": "Diana \"Hans Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RRPJN4L4U6U98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say I never would have bought this camera had it not been on sale, but I am so glad I did.  Not only does it take really great pictures but it also records video with sound.  How many $200 dollar digital cameras do that.  We have not so great lighting in our house and my previous digital camera a Cannon did a terrible job with indoor pictures, but this one does so well, I have yet to have a picture that was too dark.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1L70AH3CTD5MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this camera for Christmas and I am very impressed by it.  I have a really expensive 35mm camera, and I'm finding this camera to have more features than my 'nice' camera.I thought this camera took great pictures in the dark.  You must be sure you have it set in the right settings, but I took outstanding dark indoor pictures w/ no flash.  It has settings for you to adjust the +/- EV lighting to make dark or bright pictures.  I like that you can adjust the shutter speed, record sound, and video.  You can also adjust the primary colors to fade florescent lighting or to bring out the colors in a blue sky day.  I can't wait to take some slow motion pictures of streams.The quality is more than enough for your 4x6in. pictures.  I had to downsize the quality for people pictures, because my computer is too slow to handle such big pictures.  I can only imagine how well really good photography pictures will come out.The camera is very light and you will want rechargeable batteries.  I look forward to years of pictures with this little camera!", "Date": "January 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "carol", "ReviewID": "R1W113D7BBKVQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just bought this camera yesterday, and so far i am surprised a the quality of it.  it does video clips, expandable with greater memory, has a flash, which some do not do, has many function usually available with only more expensive cameras. it can use two differant types of media and does well in low light.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Ridiculously low battery life", "Author": "carrie", "ReviewID": "R2I0C9RKYEZVQT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was given to my husband and I as a gift about 2 years ago now (Dec. 2005). This thing has a battery life of zero. From day one, we could only take 6 or 7 photos before the camera died and the batteries had to be replaced (we always use premium alkalines). The recharger that came with it was no help - recharged batteries don't work. My mother-in-law also received the camera then and hers has the same problem.
