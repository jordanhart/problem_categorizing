This camera is great for scenery shots, and still shots, not so much for just a fun run-around camera.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "David E. Evans", "ReviewID": "R1SS4T3HNE1ZRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is everything it promised to be.  It had a tough act to follow considering that I finally broke down and bought this to replace the Fuji SLR 35mm I purchased back in 1980  (loved that camera).  This one does everything and then some that the older one did. Buy this camera if you want versatility and ease of creativity.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "LCD Digital Camera", "Author": "Carolyn A.
