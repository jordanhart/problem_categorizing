Look creators of blue crane if a person ordered the \"beginner\" DVD, it means hes a beginner therefore when you change the display on the menu screen from the lcd camera to show its features, YOU ALSO SHOW WHICH BUTTONS YOUR FINGER PUSHED TO GET THERE. For instance, you just cant say \"go to contrast settings, then to etc\" without showing which buttons the finger pushed like your stupid instruction film did on MANY occasions, to the beginners, the camera has hundreds of buttons to choose from. I end up paying a local camera guy 2 hrs of lesson and i learned everything in that 2 hrs meanwhile these STUPID DVD shows screens after screens without showing which buttons were pushed to get there. u can replay it 100 times and u still wont learn anything from it... my best advice is to mingle with a guy locally who knows how to use it hands on, it only took me 2 hrs to learn everything. DONOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE DVD.edited: what they could have done to improve these DVD is to show a split screen where it shows the live mode in one screen and shows which buttons were pushed to get there on the second screen, instead of just having the entire screen covered with live mode and the screen changing modes right before your eyes and you donot know which buttons were pushed to get there. i catch myself pausing the dvd then say \"how did he got there?\" with NO ANSWERS to my question.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.90", "Features": "Introduction, basic controls, advanced topics\n2 pack DVD bundle\nArranged into chapters, go at your own pace, go back and review anytime\nBlue Crane camera training DVD\nCreate great images", "Name": "Canon DVD 5D Mark II 2 Pack Vol. 1 & 2 Camera Training Video Guide by Blue Crane Digital", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eiMSAeQeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003EPBGL0"}}
