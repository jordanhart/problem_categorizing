Blurry underwater!!", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R3BRO987GWRHC7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that everything I have ever bought from Coleman has been very reliable and trustworthy.  That being said:This is the worst product I have found in a long time.  We have a family vacation coming up, and we wanted to get a camera that we can use for underwater.  We researched a few cameras, and decided to go with this one.  There was only one review on the whole web, and now I know why.  This thing is a piece of work.First off...you can't shut the door that leads to the battery and memory card.  I have tried to even knock it on the table and it just won't close.  It closes when it wants.  I am happy to see they take \"water proof\" seriously, but it would be nice to be able to open and shut that door, especially when the charging port is in that door as well.  We have been trying all night to close the door back up, and can not do so.The picture quality is bad.  I haven't used it in the water yet (plan to this weekend), but I took a few indoor pics (with flash), and they looked worse than when I take them on my phone camera (a G1 google outdated phone).It is sturdy, but cheaply made.  I know, you get what you buy; and that we did.  The shipping was way too high for it taking 6 days to get here (when I paid extra ($20)for expedited mail).  I ordered stuff directly from amazon at the same time and paid significantly less and they both showed up on the same day, same time.The \"extra\" battery that came with the kit doesn't fit the camera properly.  It is a generic battery that pops out every time you try to charge the thing.  You have to sit it in the right position and DO NOT TOUCH IT or it will pop out and won't charge.I will write more when I try it in the water.Ok, so now I have used it multiple times in and out of the water.  This is an outdoor camera.  Do not buy this if you take mostly indoor shots.  You will be very disappointed.  As I mentioned before, the flash sucks.  It is a very weak flash, and it either over exposes the picture or way under exposes it.As for underwater...I have tried it in the crisp clear Lake Superior, some semi-murky lakes, and a couple pools.  When I used it in the lakes you couldn't see anything.  When I used it in the pools you couldn't get a clear shot ever.  It takes a long time to take one picture, and by the time it shoots you don't have any breath left so all you see is a blur of a person.  Those disposable underwater cameras work better than this camera.  Even if you have it on sport you can't get a clear shot unless you tell the person you are shooting to stand really still and don't breath until the camera takes the picture.The video quality is decent for a digital camera.  We got some really cool cliff jumping videos with this camera in Lake Superior.  The only thing that really sucks is when you use the camera for video there is no sound.  There is a plug to plug in a microphone, but the sound is basically non-existent.  You can hear the zooming in and out very well.  It clicks really loud in your video.  That is all you can hear.  You can't use the plug if you are near water as it may seep into the camera and ruin it.  So if you want sound it has to be on dry land.Overall, I hate it less than I did when I opened the package, but I still am very disappointed in this product.  I don't write reviews often for items, but this was worthy of warning people of what you are buying.  Don't buy it.  Get a disposable underwater camera if you want to take water pictures.  Don't spend $100 on this product!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004WSLZJQ"}}
