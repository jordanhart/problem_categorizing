Before, my only complaint was that it was \"staticky\" and I had to move the receiver around to positions where it wouldn't interfere with other devices. After about six months of use however, it made a loud permanent buzzing sound whenever I turned the volume on regardless of where it was placed. It was so annoying it was unusable. The only way it was tolerable if I turned on the video portion only but kept the sound off which didn't work for me since I'm not always looking at the monitor, especially at night when I'm sleeping!I called Mobicam to see if I could get a replacement but the length of their policy is something pathetic like a month.I ended up buying Summer Infant Deluxe Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5\" Screen - Blue (Infant Deluxe Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5\" Screen) as a replacement which I'm MUCH happier with even though it as it's own drawbacks. I will also write a review for that.5/9/09: Love/hate relationship with this monitor (Original Review)We had our heart set on a video monitor (not just an audio one) and it was between this and Summer. We decided on this one because of the Internet option so we could see our little guy from work.When the monitor works, it works FANTASTICALLY. We can see our baby both during the day and at night due to the infrared. I like being able to see his eyes -- if they are closed, I leave him be even if he's whimpering/crying because it means he'll be able to go back to sleep on his own. If they are open, I go to to see what's bothering him.That was the love part. The hate part is that there is static galore. The monitor flickers and buzzes even if you place anything near it -- it doesn't even have to be anything electrical in nature, the screen fizzes out even if you put your hand by the monitor. If you have a wireless phone, it will crackle louder than the TV in Poltergeist. It is super annoying and I spent a lot of time finding the perfect spot to place the monitor where it wouldn't be affected by anything and where I could still see it.We have our unit on continuous video monitoring so we always plug it into an A/C outlet, otherwise, we would go through way too many batteries.I wish we could purchase another video monitor so we can leave one in our room and put one downstairs.As of now, we haven't really used the Internet option. If that feature isn't important to you, I would try the Summer unit instead since that's the one our friends recommend and it seems to have pretty good reviews on Amazon.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this monitor!

Several reviews on here indicate that this is a permanent problem.  This product is abysmal, and no one should buy it.  The people who have not yet experienced problems, will eventually, I am convinced.

I recieved a total of 4 baby monitors, but since this was the only video one, I kept it and returned the others. I had no idea how comforting it would be to have a video monitor! It's great to be able to see him when he makes noise, and to see if he's just fussing or needs me or whatever. The night vision works great, but the colors are muted with the daytime view. Not a big deal, as far as I'm concerned because you can still see baby well. Does have occasional issues with static, but sometimes you just have to move around the monitor or camera and the problem can be solved. (Surprised that we've only had minimal issues with interference given all of the electronics/cordless devices in our home).Here comes the BUT... part:So, we've been using the monitor for six months now, and this morning it stopped working. We've had occasional problems where you would switch it on, and there would be no power to the monitor.  Sometimes it took a couple of times and it would come on. (This is using the DC adapter, not batteries). I tried everything to get it to come on, switching outlets, putting batteries in, and nothing. So, I called Mobi directly (since it was a gift, I didn't know where it was from. I didn't have a reciept, or fill out a warranty card. So I took my chances and called them. What could they do? Say no?) I talked to a guy named Andy, super nice and understanding. I am to ship my monitor to him, and he'll bench test it. If it doesn't work, he'll send me a new one. Fair enough.So, I guess that's why I'm giving it four stars, instead of three. Customer service on Mobi's part seems well worth it. I guess we'll see what happens in a few days when I get it back!", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't Do As Much As Expected", "Author": "mkhollis", "ReviewID": "R1BCZK188RSIJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "5 pros, 6 cons = decent, but just ok, baby monitor systemI bought this camera to replace a Summer baby monitor (also video, but the rechargable battery isn't holding much of a charge after 2 years), mainly because it had the internet feature & can watch 2 monitors at once.The Good1. The setup is easy (as with all monitors).2. Picture is clear, day or night.3. Sound is clear.4. It can monitor camera 1, camera 2, or you can make it toggle between 2 cameras.5. It does not interfer with our wireless network or wireless digital Panasonic phones (why I got this 900mHz version instead of the 2.4G version as reviewed complained about).The Bad:1. The angle for the camera is odd. Think about it -- camera for toddler near floor = asking for trouble. The camera lens will angle up but not down. When I place it higher on a bookshelf, I have to lie the camera on its side to be able to adjust the angle downward so I can see into the crib. I definitely can't mount it on the wall like the Summer unit. BTW, lying the camera on its side affects the night vision, so you have to have it at the very edge of the shelf, practically leaning over the edge.2. The monitor unit eats batteries! It takes SIX AA's in just the monitor unit, and after 1 week of occasional use (about 4-5 hours total?) I had to replace them. So, a little constraining to have to drag the AC plug around to different parts of the house.3. The internet connection feels like a rip off. You only get TWO hours of monitoring per MONTH unless you want to pay $9.95/month! If I buy an internet hookup, I expect to be able to watch my monitor any time or have my family be able to watch any time as well.4. The internet connection is awkward. You have to hook up the physical monitor to a computer constantly with a bunch of wires & adapters. So, at night (when I actually use the monitor), I have a choice of having the monitor hooked up to my computer OR be able to watch the monitor next to my bed. Who wants a computer running next to their bed all the time with a tangled mess of wires?5. The voice-activation feature is quite annoying if you have it on while you are sleeping. It sounds like it is having interference constantly, is quite loud with the static, and blinks the monitor on & off. This may be fine if you are recording, but I don't have a need for that feature.6. It was made in China, so it seems a little cheap. Several times the button for switching the cameras has gotten stuck so that I had to pry it out with a screwdriver.In all, I like the fact that it will switch between cameras (planning for baby #2 now), so I will keep it. I am sorely disappointed that I got the internet hookup though. I wish I had gotten the extra camera instead for the same price.If you just need 1 camera & no internet, go for the Summer baby video monitor.

Edwards \"Ubercrafting hip Mommy\"", "ReviewID": "R1X0X0APDQB4XS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I usually don't take time to write reviews, but I had to on this one.  This has been the only monitor I have had for almost 4 months since my daughter was born.  No matter WHAT I did I had constant interference.  I unplugged all of the cordless phones and WiFi... anything that made sense for the problem.  It got better, but still constant \"police radio\" noises came out of it.  I could not sleep through this and was at my wits end.  I found that there is a mode that the monitors are in standby until she cries, so that was better but when the sound subsides and it stops sending the god awful police radio sound LOUDLY blasts from the monitor.  I already had to leave the thing in another room to try to sleep through that, but all my daughter would do was sniffle and inevitably that is what woke me up.. the monitor. Oh and this is just being in the next room... it isn't like we are far away.  I finally bought a nice digital Graco today and it is totally silent.  No, there is no video but we aren't currently using the video anyway.  I hated how the bright light shines right in my daughters face for the night vision... I can't see that that will help her sleep at all.  When she is older and moving around, I might turn the audio OFF and just use it for video.. when I can see through the static. Oh and it will DRAIN your batteries if you want to tote it around constantly on.. you will be buying 4 AA batteries for each every day.  if you use the mode where it turns on when they cry I am sure it will last longer... and if you don't use the video.  Basically, it is NOT a good monitor if you want to spend time outside.  It is also very heavy and cumbersome to carry in your pocket.I also bought the part to hook it up to the internet.  The software, camera and computer refuse to talk to each other.  The software is old.So, I generally hate this thing and if I had purchased it myself at the store I would have taken it back.

On the first night it made so much static, even with the volume at the lowest point that we couldn't sleep.  We returned it and paid more for the Summer monitor with the big screen.  It made a VERY loud constant static noise on the lowest sound setting.  I finally turned the volume off and used a separate regular monitor for sound and just used the screen on the Summer.  After about 2 weeks the monitor quit working.  I returned it to Babies R Us (who were great about the whole thing by the way).  I got the same Summer monitor.  I brought it home.  Same thing, 2 weeks later it quit working...of course on the night that my daughter puked for the first time.  I went back at 8:00 p.m. and exchanged it once again only to get home, and the brand new Summer monitor didn't work at all.  I took it back the next day and got my money back.  I went to Walmart and saw the Mobi video monitor.  I was reluctant to buy it because it was so inexpensive, around $99.00 which was about $60 less than the Summer.  I have had it for 2 years now.  It does have a slight static sound every once in awhile but nothing I can't live with.  Considering the 2 other monitors that were junk this one has been amazing.  Having 2 kids, and being clumsy myself, the part of the monitor that has the screen has been dropped numerous times and keeps on working.  I just had my first problem with it.  It only works with batteries.  I called Mobi, the girl on the phone was so nice and helped me troubleshoot it. It turns out, the cord was broken and they are sending me a new cord.  I have to pay $6.00 for shipping because I didn't save my receipt but if I had it they would have sent it for free.  Seems fair to me.  Overall I would definitely highly recommend this monitor!

That coupled with all the other picture issues, interference, etc, is now forcing us to purchase a different brand of monitor. Very disappointed.Original review:I got the Mobi over the other popular brand based on good reviews online and I needed a 2nd camera because I have twins. Unfortunately, although it works and does not short out on me or have insane amounts of static, so it is tolerable, it has several shortcomings that have been very frustrating. But first, I will say the customer service is great- I wrote to the company about the camera quality and they emailed me back quickly & they promptly sent me a new camera free of charge. Unfortunately it was no better than the first but I thought that was really nice!!!!1. The tilt of the camera is very frustrating. I can only get about half the crib in the view with the camera on the side of the crib. I have no idea where I would mount it with the limited tilt to get a better view.2. The button that switches between the cameras on the first one I got quickly became jammed and therefore unusable. I returned it for a new set.3. Apparently Mobi changed their cameras recently and not for the better. My second camera, purchased separately, is extremely clear/sharp, in daytime it is in color, it is really a wonderful picture (not quite what the promo photo makes it out to be but pretty good I think!). Unfortunately the camera that came in the package and the new one they sent me are terrible in comparison. They are not in color during the day and the picture is very grainy/dark/fuzzy all the time. I can see my daughter but cannot see the details like her features, or the details of the mobile in her crib, etc like I can with the camera in my son's crib. If I turn up the brightness to help with that camera, the other one gets too bright & I can't see the picture, and vice versa with the darkness.4. On the flip side- the 'good' camera has way more interference (the 'bad' one has no interference at all)- if I am on our cordless phone near the receiver, there is a lot of interference noise, and if it is sitting next to me while I'm on my laptop, there is staticky noise when I do things like scroll down & click on various links. Very strange. Also I have noticed that my body can mess with the reception but that is easy to fix by just shifting the receiver a little bit.So that being said, I wouldn't really recommend it since there are other competitors that I have heard better things about, but it isn't terrible.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy at your Own Risk!!!", "Author": "C.

That is a good thing.  900 mhz is a very unpopular frequency these days, which shouldn't have to much interference in your home. However, old devices will be really effected this. A cordless phone @ 900 mhz will effect this terribly.  My phone was a 5+ ghz.  Didn't solve it.  Then I looked at my wireless speakers.  It was 900 mhZ. Unplugged them, and presto-change-o, no interference!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!2.  You can also tie the cord in a knot (that is easy to untie!) to create a feedback loop.  This will VERY *slightly* change the frequency, like changing a channel on a cordless phone.  Don't expect to solve your problems with this, but it will help if all other wireless interference is gone.3.  The same goes for wireless security cameras, headphones too.  Maybe even wireless video game controler too, get creative in finding the source.People who have beef with this device either:a.  Have a device I just mentioned.b.  Are using this monitor at least 3 stories apart or just through too many walls.  No monitor will carry much more range strength than another.  If you have a range strength problem DO NOT USE BATTERIES.  You need the full 9 volt AV power to get the signal through long distances, concrete, etc..c.  Live in an apartment with neighbors who are using a device mentioned above. If that is the case.  You might be up a creek, unless you can pin-point it and coordinate with what frequencies you are both on.  This sounds crazy, but they could be having problems with their devices that they would want to solve too.  Mobicam now makes a \"digilock\" frequency that they claim will fix this.  Do your own research on this frequency. I couldn't find it online.d.  Note that the people who are complaining about computer wifi interference must be using a 900mhz router.  I didn't know those EVER existed.  They are just wrong. The only way a computer or another electronic could affect this is if you had it close enough to cause an electromagnetic interferences, not a frequency one. It would have to be really close.So this review is in part too help the general public by informing them.  But it's more to just show-off and prove how great I am to an anonymous, general community that will never give me the gratification that I deserve.  God,  I am such a loser.UPDATE:  Tonight I have heard a few static buzzes as my wife walked by it, but got no more of a static buzz then a radio or cordless phone would have.

It was nice because at night I could turn the vision off once he was asleep and just keep the sound on like a normal audio monitor. However, there are many more cons than pros on this system.PROS:1. Night vision worked well.2. Ability to switch from audio to video whenever needed was nice.3. Price was very low compared to most video monitors. But...you get what you pay for. I was hoping I would get lucky, I suppose.CONS:1. Very lightweight; we never used it with batteries because it was sucking the life out of the batteries within days, so we always kept it plugged in. The weight of the plug itself will pull the camera around and makes it tough to position to where you want.2. Using plugs all the time also means you don't really have a cordless unit to watch...unplugging and re-plugging the unit to whatever room you need it in is a pain and cumbersome.3. Camera's vertical position with limited mobility or adjustment options doesn't allow you to easily position to watch your kid. This is especially true if you plan to keep it up higher on a shelf where the kid can't reach it or play with it. We had to lay our camera down on its belly to see anything and even then it wasn't exactly right. This laying down position also made it even harder for it to stay in place with the plug pulling on it.4. After almost exactly one year of \"ok\" use, it one day just crapped out. The video portion still worked but the audio turned into a loud continuous buzz/hum that I am now reading in all the other reviews. Makes the unit completely worthless when you really only use the video in rare cases and the audio is the more important/more often used part. When we called the manufacturer, the CS rep told us that it would cost us $56 to send it in and have it fixed...ha ha! The unit itself cost right around $90 so completely not worth it.

Then she said you can pay to send it in and we we will test it to see what is wrong and we will call you to tell you how much you owe MobiCam Comm. to have it repaired. I let her know that I had only had it for 2 months and that the store would not exchange b/c it was passed the return period. And she cont'd to be rude. So I asked to speak to her supervisor. The supervisor was nice but said the same thing that I had to pay to send it in and pay to have issue resolved. This is no way to treat customers. If they can not replace their product when it it there issue they should not be selling new equipment that they are making people pay to have fixed when it was a manufacturer defect from the begining.

I am on my third and fourth camera because the night vision went out on both of my monitors and I am in need of a new monitor because there is \"dead spots\" in the volume dial.I really, really wanted this monitoring system to work.  I bragged and told everyone I knew how GREAT this product was in the first 6 months that I had it.  But that was about how long the honeymoon period lasted.  Then I had to purchase a new monitor because it was actually cheaper to buy a new camera then it was to ship and pay to have the old one fixed.  Then a month later the other camera quit working.  In both the camera the night vision quit working.  So you could still use the cameras as long as you didn't turn the lights out...which of course doesn't work with babies that are trying to sleep.A couple months ago the power cord for the monitor quit working, luckily I was able to use a power cord from one of the two old cameras I still had in a drawer.  And now the sound keeps messing up, I have to find just the right spot for the volume dial because of \"dead spots\" where you NO sound.  And sometimes the sound will just go away, I turn it off and back on and then it is fine.  But during the middle of the night the last thing I need is for the sound to stop working.Like I said I really wanted to LOVE this system, but it has worked really really hard to make me hate it!

If you have a sound machine on in the baby's room there is no way to make the monitor's volume really low.2) it came with a rechargeable battery pack.  The camera takes  AA and the monitor takes 6. So we always use the A/C plug because I hate going through batteries.Pros:1)I like you can see your baby's eyes and whether or not they are closed.2)unlike some of the reviews i have not experience crazy static. my cell phone does not interfere.3) has an Auto on mode so you can set it and the monitor will not come on unless there is noise from the baby. (although you can't use this function if you have a noise machine in their room.)4) you can turn off the video part and just have it function as a regular monitor if you wish. Nice feature if the monitor is next to your bed at night.  I just turn on the video if i hear my son cry out to see what the situation is before i go in.5)the picture is a good size.

It's unfortunate, because the monitor does have excellent audio capabilities. When the monitor isn't experiencing static, it can pick up the sound of our baby breathing, which is comforting to hear.

We were wanting a video monitor for our first baby boy and I searched for a while. After reading reviews this product seemed like a good fit for us. Well it wasn't. There are several things we hated about this unit. First and for most, there is terrible static. The base and camera were less than 20 ft apart. IF someone walked in front of the hand held unit, static or a loud buzz then it went away. If you got too close to the camera, same thing. The hand unit is very bulky and takes 6AA batteries, yes 6! Thankfully we already used rechargeable batteries but it drains them in less than 2 hrs if unplugged from wall adapter. The camera's range of tilt is very limited. You have to have something to sit the camera unit upright on almost directly in front of what you want monitored. The camera also takes several batteries but thankfully we could leave it plugged up at all times. The only thing that worked good on this was the audio when using audio only. But you still had static in it from time to time. WE returned this unit after less than a week and got a refund. Everyone talks about the Summer brand video monitors and they are right. I know they are more expensive but definitely worth it. We got a Summer unit that comes with its own rechargeable battery pack in it and the camera tilts and pans and zooms from the hand unit. The unit we got gos for $175 at Wal-Mart which is way outta our price range but we got lucky and went to a Once Upon a Child store and got it brand new in the box for $60. If you have one of this nearby then I highly recommend you check one out. If not and can stand to spend a little more money then definitively go for the Summer brand monitors. We got the BestView(tm) Handheld Color Video Monitor and it is the most amazing thing ever. We can take the handset anywhere in our house or yard and it has a signal meter right on the set and I've never seen it have less than 3 bars. The MobiCam would barely pick up on the porch without loud distortion unless being put in very specific spots and not moved. All in all I would highly suggest to stay away from this unit.

We purchased as a set**We have had the Mobicam Ultra for a couple of years for our daughter and decided to get this new system when our son was born so that we could monitor both rooms using just the one monitor.  The monitor itself has two stations and each camera gets one station.  When you set the monitor to scan these it flips back and forth about every 10 seconds between the two cameras so that you can see/hear what is going on in each room.PROS:*Does allow you to monitor two rooms at once (not simultaneously but scans on it's own).  Not all multicamera systems out there do this, they can only monitor one room at a time.*Decent sound and video quality.CONS:*The ability to choose between VOX mode and camera mode is on the camera itself which means going into baby's room to make the switch, rather defeating the purpose of the monitor.  The Ultra had this setting on the monitor so I could keep it on voice activation mode all the time and then switch over real quick if I just wanted to make sure she was still in bed etc.  This was a big deal for me because when I switched to camera mode in the Ultra I was even able to hear her breathing and feel reassured that she was OK.  With the AV, when you set it in camera mode there was (for us) static that I did not want to listen to all the time.  Same is the case with the Ultra but since the setting is on the monitor I would just switch back to VOX once I knew all was well and not have to listen to the static.*The volume dial on the AV does not have numbers as the Ultra did.  With the Ultra I knew I wanted the volume at 3 or 4 but without the benefit of numbers on the AV it's a guessing game as to how loud it's going to be when she makes a noise.*Lots of interference/static.  There was static each time the scan switched the channel and sometimes just random static while on one channel.*The kicker, and ultimately why we had to return the item... we could see and hear another baby.  I live in a free standing house and the nearest baby to me is across a wide street and down a house so I assumed that was the baby I was seeing however I have now spoken with everyone on my block that has a baby in a crib and none of them have a video monitor so I have no idea whose baby I was seeing.  My best guess is that it's someone from one block over, behind my across the street neighbors.  That's pretty far away and even Mobi was surprised when I told them I thought I was seeing the baby just across the street.  FYI, Mobi also indicated that the interference and static I experienced was probably due to this other monitor so perhaps others would not have as much interference as I did.We decided to get a digital instead (which incidentally is also what Mobi suggested).  We didn't get the Mobi digital because my first issue above is still the case with that system.  So far I like the digital (even though it's more expensive) MUCH better than both the monitors I refer to above.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time", "Author": "Stuck in Michigan \"/T\"", "ReviewID": "R36VPLGPEF0TV5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible monitor.

I willalso say that the camera does not have very good range . You can not oput it up on a dresser and aim it down, and if your child kicks at all it willnot stay on the crib ledge. It does however stay with a little velcro :). Good theory just not sure if it really works yet. Stuck in the middle......
