I researched and played with tons of cameras before finally deciding on the Nikon S200.  The choice was that it carried similar features of high-end/high-expense cameras on the market.  It was only natural to choose this camera as it gave me great quality at a poor man's budget.  And if something ever happens to it such as getting lost or stolen while on trips, it won't put me in the hole.  I also have early Parkinson's disease.  It has a stabilizing feature that allows me to take the pictures despite my shaking.  Believe me, it is a nice feeling to be able to take a picture and not have it blurred or smeared.  Other cameras on the market didn't help with this and left me overwhelmed and frustrated.

However, it's the first Coolpix to use the VR designation that uses \"digital\" VR instead of the proven and preferable lens shift and CCD shift VR.On the positive side, it uses a reliable lithium-ion battery system, and Nikon is much more reasonable than many brands on accessories such as batteries.

I thought I would try a Nikon since my first \"real\"camera was a Nikon 35MM which took great pictures.  I have been extremely disappointed in the quality of the pictures on this camera.  Like other reviewers, I found them grainy, blurry and the colors are way off.  I have played around with all the settings but I just can't get a decent indoor shot.  Outdoor pictures are slightly better, but still not great.  Also, the lag time drives me crazy - I have three young children and have missed countless shots waiting for the shutter to release.  Also, the price for this is crazy!  I bought it for under $200 over a year ago, so I don't know why the seller would think anyone would pay over $400 for an outdated model....", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this camera-- LENS ERROR after a few months", "Author": "J Dub \"unhappy customer\"", "ReviewID": "R3KA36UVK4RJRQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last October and this August when I was taking pictures of my toddler, all of a sudden the camera started making noises and then 'lens error' appeared on the lcd screen and the camera would no longer work.

It takes nice photos. Images are in focus and have accurate color.  It's light and small enough to fit nicely in my shirt pocket. It starts and focuses quickly. It has a fair macro feature. The price is very reasonable. But after using it for a week I returned it.I won't rate the camera way down for the little disappointments it offered, as I know that what I didn't like is mostly a matter of preference, but I do want to list my considerations.The shutter and power buttons are both fairly flat and near each other on the top of the camera. When taking photos on a cold day I couldn't feel them and a couple of times turned the camera off instead of taking a shot.I don't like the zoom rocker position on the back of the camera. It forces the use of two hands to zoom in or out. It's a little awkward to use and the zoom itself is not smooth, seeming to have preset values that weren't always what I wanted.The doors for the battery/memory card and the I/O ports were both very cheap and fragile seeming. They are attached by little rubbery cords rather than hinges. I don't trust them to hold up.A couple of times between shots the screen went black and wouldn't come back on when I pressed any button. The lens was still extended so the camera hadn't powered down. I had to turn it of then on again to regain functionality. I don't know if the camera was a fault or I didn't understand it but I don't have that problem on my other two cameras or with my wife's camera.Because the camera takes nice photos and is inexpensive and light it might work well for some, but I would recommend actually handling it, trying the zoom and opening the doors before buying.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Never got good pics with it...", "Author": "John B.

No longer under warranty, so can't afford to fix something when the fix isn't going to solve the problem.  I did get a 'lens error' message once when I accidentally pushed both of the buttons on the top (the shutter button and the on/off switch are located very close to one another), but shutting it off and taking out the battery saved that mistake.  We homeschool our kids, so I'm hoping we can just add this to the 'crappy digital camera' pile and let the kids dissect it and turn it into something useful some day.Note:  the camera is unusable when it gets the 'lens error message' and you can rarely fix this yourself.At about $1.89 per picture taken, I'd say that this is not an affordable camera.
