Taking photographs is fun with user friendly menu. I did not even pen the manual. I have taken several good photographs using this camera. Thge pictures were crystal clear at highest resolution. But if you are lookign for a camera which can zoom, then this camera is not for you. I take only point and shoot pictures most of the time and so its perfect for me.Okay now I want to tell something about the part after you take the snaps. That is downloading. The software is so easy to use and when you plug in this camera the software automatically downloads all the pictures. Actually on my computer I can see the camera as a drive in windows explorer.Things I dont like are low memory and low battery life. I recommend buying rechargeable batteries and 256 Mb compact flash card which is right now on sale in amazon.com.", "Date": "February 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "simple so far", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1E3YJMJ5F5HKN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera from Amazon.  At first, I was nervous.  The camera is very small and light -- it felt... cheap.  I loaded up the software (Windows 98) without a problem.  I was able to take pics the first day, upload them, edit them, and email them.  The pictures were really quite good -- I wouldn't consider paying hundreds for more expensive cameras -- it's not worth it.  The free 32 MB card (offer from Amazon which might have expired) lets me take about 35 pics at the best quality. Cons: the LCD screen is really pretty small and the editing software is really basic.  But it lets you email people right away and sends them at low resolution so your friends won't have to download gigantic files when they open your email.I am mostly pleased so far.  I did not want to spend big $ and I feel I definitely got my money's worth -- $... for the camera and the free 32 MB secure digital card.  Also -- I was able to connect to my TV and view pics there without a problem.Kodak EasyShare is definitely Easy.  I don't have a Dock and won't buy one -- that's just unnecessary.  This is a very good First Camera to buy for those on a budget but want pics that look clean, crisp, and that are easy to take/edit/email.", "Date": "May 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R27MJZRX5W42SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift.  I wanted a new digital camera since my last one had 640x480 res. and the pictures were not that great to say the least.  I have a new son and we were taking lots of pictures to email to family members.  I just love this camera.  The docking cradle is a must.  This camera has rechargeable batteries that charge in the docking cradle.  And the pictures tranfer at the touch of a button.  This is so much easier than the last camera I had.  The quality of the pictures is great, good exposure, the flash set to auto works well, not too bright.  The only negative thing I would have to say is the LCD screen does not work well in low light, but I have no problem dealing with that.  This is a good 2MP camera at a good price.

I even printed an 8X10 of my daughter and it turned out great. The images were not grainy as I had suspected they would be. I have read a lot of reviews that state the casual photographer should not need much more than a 2.0 mega-pixel camera. After printing pictures and having some printed by online retailers, I must say I am NOT disappointed. The colors seem true to life and I haven't seen much red-eye. Transfering pictures to your computer is easy, even without the dock. Just connect your USB cable to the camera and your computer, turn on the Kodak easy share software and hit transfer. You can transfer all your pictures at once, one-by-one, or by date acquired. I transferred 8 pictures at once and it only took a few seconds. You can edit the pictures with the software, e-mail them or order online prints. I have it set up so that pictures automatically get stored in the \"my pictures\" file on my computer, but that really wasn't needed. I think this is a very good camera for first timers and people that are on a limited budget.

I know there are hundreds of digital cameras for sale but I settled on this one from a beginners point of view. My budget was limited, my knowledge of digital photography was limited, and my experience with Kodak has always been pleasant. I've not been disappointed with this camera. I bought it with the intentions of taking vacation photos and snapshots. It does the job well.If you don't plan to make enlargements, only print standard sized photos, this 2MP camera is great. You will need lots of batteries though and a battery charger. Also plan on buying an extra memory card or two if you plan to take lots of photos. The internal memory is only equal to \"one roll of film\".I recommend that you purchase a supply of rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. These digital cameras eat batteries at a alarming pace. You will want at least eight batteries. I took pictures in the daytime during vacation and charged up the batteries each evening. Don't leave the display screen on any more than you have to. It wastes the battery power in no time.Also you will want to buy extra memory for this camera. The 32MB internal memory was really not sufficient enough for my use. I bought a 256MB SD memory card and even at the highest resolution I can now get 10 times the number of pictures as before.The Easyshare software is easy to use but it's sort of hoggish unless you have tons of space on your computer's hard drive. I loaded the software and then realized that I already had everything \"I\" needed on my computer so promptly deleted the Kodak Easyshare software. You may want to keep it running. It has lots of nice features. I just didn't need all it's 'bells and whistles'. My camera came with an older Easyshare software version. If yours does that too you can always download the latest version from the Kodak.com web site. The instruction booklet is small but it contains tons of information. Read it. Those few buttons on the back of the camera are misleading. They are all multi-functional. I wish they'd included a wallet sized \"cheat card\". I made one for myself to tuck into my pocket. My memory needs an upgrade too, ha!You can download your pictures directly from the camera into your computer. It's really painless. I haven't tried printing pictures yet from a Kodak kiosk so I can't comment on that. I've only printed some on my printer and sent some as email attachments.So far I've been very pleased with the camera. It's wonderful not to have to buy film all the time. I love being able to take a picture, load it onto my hard drive and email it right away. No more waiting for the film to be developed. No more waiting extra days for the photo lab to put my pictures on disk or CD.", "Date": "June 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "perfect basic digital camera", "Author": "E. Lundin \"eal5b\"", "ReviewID": "R1U4O1EBR31QK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A previous review made a false claim regarding the flash.  If you turn it off, it will stay off (or whatever you set it to) until you turn the camera off and turn it back on again.  the default setting is always auto.As for the quality, I think the camera is well-made, but perhaps some aspects of the design are lacking: the battery door opens very easily if you rest your fingers on it while holding the camera; the SD slot door clicks closed nicely, but the hinge is flimsy; the directional pad is hard to press in the middle (for the OK button) without also pressing one of the arrows at the same time.  An annoying flaw is that the camera has trouble taking more than 2 pictures in quick succession.  After that the camera takes several seconds to be photo ready again.The same reviewer was accused by another reviewer from Seattle of being a racist based on the comment implying that everything made in China is cheap in quality.  ...Being half-Chinese myself, I don't think there was anything wrong with the first reviewer's statement. Most of the stuff made in China IS cheap in quality. They're getting better, but it's practically a fact of modern life that \"made in china\" = significant probability of low quality.Back to the camera: This is not a professional camera nor anywhere close to it. Diagonal lines, for example, are often pixellated even on highest quality (when viewed at actual size).  that said, the quality of the photos is plenty adequate for simple photography, and its close-up photos (use the switch, take photo from range of 1') are top-quality--they are the best type of photo it takes.the 2X digital zoom is pretty worthless, since it degrades the quality of the picture.the camera gets very good battery life on 1800mah NiMH rechargeables.when indoors and not using the flash, you either need to hold the camera extremely steady or decrease the exposure time, otherwise the picture will be blurred.If all you want to do is have a digital camera for basic use, i.e., simple family photos, sightseeing, etc., buy this camera.  And if you happen to sell a few things online every now and then as I do, this camera is more than adequate for close-up product-photos, unless you need photos at a range of less than 6 inches.  If you're looking for a camera for amatuer photography or anything more sophisticated, you might want a 3MP with a zoom at least.", "Date": "July 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R310KPXQA1BTTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price.

I'm glad I decided to go for this one, though, because honestly, I don't think I would have been able to tell a difference between the pictures from this camera and the DX. I also didn't expect the camera to be this small and light... My only gripes would have to be that the batteries exhaust themselves pretty quickly.

We've taken hundreds of photos and are well pleased with it. It's easy to use and the software gave us no problem at all. But the most truly amazing thing about our camera is this - we live in Ohio and visited Dawes Arboretum (a magnificent place) and I accidentally dropped our camera. It hit the ground, rolled down an incline, went off the incline into the lake where it became totally submerged. I jumped in after it and it was dead as a doornail. We removed the Kodak memory card and the batteries, hoping to use them in a different camera. Today, four days after the dunking incident, I put the batteries and the card back in, turned it on and it's working again, just as good as new. The pictures transferred as well as they ever did, and all the camera's functions are working.

I am going out of the country to visit family next month, and I plan on taking a lot of pictures, but I didn't want to lug around boxes and boxes of film (I need to save all the suitcase space for clothes and whatnot).  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money on the camera, just in case I lose it, as I often tend to lose things.  For the price, I am so far very pleased.

I opened up the package, put the batteries in, and started taking pictures.  I have yet to look at the instruction manual! The one thing that I was a little disappointed about was the battery usage, but I'll get over it.  I plan on buying the lithium batts.  I had the camera on for about an hour and already the batts were on their last leg.  But in their defense, I had the live feed on, and was trying it out on my TV, computer, etc.  I'm sure that it'll be just fine when I just have it on to take the pictures.I was also surprised about the quality of the pictures.  I have emailed some to my family, and they're excellent!  Plus, the software that was included is easy to use and install.  All in all, this is probably the smartest investment I have made in a while!!I will say that the shutter has to be held down for a second in order to take the picture, which is okay, but I have an 8 month old and it's impossible to get him to be still that long!

I've dropped this thing numerous times, and while the plastic casing has cracked because of the fall the interior still funtions like it's  new. Listen to other reviewers when they say this thing eats batteries. The most I can take with newly recharged batteries is probably about 30 pictures without flash.

Menu system is very easy to use, though the controls to do so lack fine control, and you may wind up trying a couple times to select on option, but that's a very minor complaint! The images are fine for email, but as with other reviewers -- printing them out in any size is an exercise in frustration. They're simply not good printed, but for 2mg pixels how much can you ask for? I found the color to be extremely true to life, the flash *more* than adequate for casual pictures, and so far it has handled surprising extremes of lighting very well. Cons? The camera sucks battery life like a starving vampire! CRV3 batteries are the only thing with any life at all, but at $10 a pop for those, you'll want to be very conscious about turning the camera off when not using it. Do NOT use AA - you'll go through 60 pounds of them inside a week, and camera performance suffers.Do NOT buy the dock! It's outrageously expensive, and you can transfer pictures with the USB cable provided. The dock is a waste of mnoney.I recommend this camera because it's the best value for the money spent for a name brand camera at the beginner level. However, if you take a lot of pictures, or want more control - ie filtering, zoom, movies etc -- then you should spend more and move up the pixel ladder to a 4mp.

I must admit there are some annoying features, the 16mb internal memory is worthless for instance, offering storage for only 20 photos. The LCD screen on the back is too small, not very good for reviewing pictures, and when using the (slow) internal memory, the picures in review mode take a few seconds to sharpen up. The internal memory is also painfully slow when taking pictures, with an annoying, long wait in between pictures. However, the camera becomes a different thing all together with a high performance SD memory card installed, offering better reviewing, picture taking and transfer speed to the computer. The picture quality is very good for a budget digital, colors are vivid, detail good. I find it doesnt perform very well in low light conditions however (like all digital cameras) and you must be careful to press the shutter button halfway down before taking pics, or risk over/under exposure. However, all cheap digicams share these problems, and i find the quality of the pics very good, i find this camera easy to use. With good quality Nimh batteries, it gives a reasonable shooting time in daylight, althought the flash reduces the battery life greatly. I also find the flash a bit too powerful at close range, although I'm sure that power would come in handy when illuminating a dark area from a long distance. All in all, this is good and I prefer the simplicity of the design, I even like the lack of zoom. The lack of zoom also increases the battery life. If you want a fancy camera, get a DSLR, if u just want to snap family pics, the CX4200 is a bargain, especially at the hugely dicounted prices I have seen lately.

I used my parent Olympus on a trip to Australia and I realized that I never wanted to go back to a regular \"film\" camera again.  I found the CX4200 and after reading many of the reviews I thought that it would be a good camera (I didn't have the money to spend the money on an Olympus).  Well I was flat out wrong.  I have only had this camera since Feburary and I want to get rid of it. Even on the highest resolution the pictures are still fuzzy and don't even think about printing out anything above a 4x6 picture because it will just look horrible. The camera come with 16mB internal memory and that is all.  It also sucks through the batteries like candy. The batteries that came with it didn't even last one day! I then used the same rechargable batteries that my parents use and I had to change them 3 times as much!  You have to have the camera on in order to transfer pics (through the USB) and that drains the battery even worse.  Also, the editing program you can use with the camera is a waste.  If you move a picture, it doesn't recognize it anymore and you have to hunt it down.  The camera is also bulkly and heavy.  The zoom is pretty much useless.  Your subject is basically unrecognizable if you try to zoom.  There is such a delay in the shutter that I have missed a lot of great shots. Plus, there is a long delay when you turn the camera on, so that can make you loose shots too. Taking pictures at night, or even low light, is horrible.  When you use the flash it floods everything out. I also had problems with the lens cover (if you can call it that). In order to turn the camera on you must flip up a switch on the front of the camera.  My switch broke and I tried calling and emailing Kodak and they told me to get new batteries and then try it! Finally I called a camera store and they told me how to take it apart and fix the problem.  So all in all, don't waste your money with this camera.
