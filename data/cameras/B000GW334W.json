They have an office in the U.S., and that is the one I contacted.  They have both an e-mail and a phone number that you can use to contact them.  I chose to e-mail, and received a response within 12 hours.  YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE 901SP DRIVER.  I uninstalled the old driver, ran the software again and chose the different driver.  So far, so good!", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Would not install", "Author": "M.
