I don't have an optical drive so I can't install the drivers or whatever is on the disc and it feels like it came out of a cracker jack box. I'm giving this to my 7 year old for her 8th birthday since I can't send it back for a refund. The description seems misleading in a way.  It was definitely not worth $25, and someone had reviewed and said he tried to upload a video to YouTube and got nothing but lines.

However, when I put the two AA batteries and SDHC 8gb card, and turned it on, it never goes past the \"powered on\" scene. Which in my case is a bright white screen that says \"JAZZ\".  It doesn't turn off the way it is suppose to, i have to take one battery out to turn it off.
