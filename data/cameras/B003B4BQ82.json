The controls take many shuffles and button pushes to change the flash or macro settings, so if you go back and forth often, you'll be wasting tons of time.  About 1/2 of the pictures it takes aer out of focus because the auto focus takes FOREVER to kick in and if you don't hold the button down long enough, it takes a quicker picture, but one that's totally blurry.  To refocus takes a good 5-10 seconds, so you can't take any pictures quickly in succession, or the subsequent ones will be blurry.  I've learned to work around it's pain in the rear-ness and most of the pictures are fine, but it's a real time waster and I still usually take double pics of each shot in case it acts up.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "stacy", "ReviewID": "R1NA44W6YXCNOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "recently bought this camera and i am perfectly happy. the price was great and operating is a breeze. the pictures are clear and prints beautifully.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice for the price", "Author": "I shouldn't of been so cheap!!!", "ReviewID": "RDQT3F8H1KMH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apparently cameras,  like TV's have come a long way.

Bond", "ReviewID": "R33NQH7S8EH6YO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera, and this one seems to work fine.  The only problem I've had is the battery charger.  The light on the charger seems to turn green (indicating a full charge) arbitrarily.  I have to shake the charger with the battery in it, and maybe plug it into the wall upside down to get the indicator light to work properly.  Even so, I check the battery voltage to make sure it has a full charge of 4.1 to 4.2 volts before putting it back into the camera.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great!", "Author": "Tanya Brekke", "ReviewID": "R2797OLQKCIKW5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For an inexpensive camera, this is GREAT.  Great quality and pictures.  Had issues with it not working in the beginning and had to send it in to GE.  Turns out it has to have an 8G sd card or larger in order to work.

I wanted to get her a camera that was easy to use, inexpensive, that also included a large LCD screen.  The description SAYS this one has a 3 inch screen; however, the manual that came with it says it's a 2.7.  I measured it against my own camera, & sure enough- this screen is NOT a 3 inch screen.  The difference is not a big one, so it's not really a huge concern; but I don't like the fact that the description was inaccurate.  The description also stated (as did the manual) that it used a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, & that the charger was included.  Well, when I opened this one to check things out I found 2 AA alkaline batteries & no charger.  That, too, is not a big issue- but it IS inaccurate advertising.  One more (minor) complaint:  the little wrist lanyard that the manual claimed was supposed to be in the box is nowhere to be found.  I'm hoping I have one from an old camera of mine that I can put on it.Since I'm just getting this camera out of the box, I haven't really tested it out to see the quality of the pics it takes.  Maybe I'll add an update later.All in all, the camera I received (GE A1455) looks like a nifty little camera; but it's not EXACTLY what is described in the Amazon ad.  The proof will be in the pics, so we'll see!  Amazon's speed of service was EXCELLENT, as I waited a little late to order!  :)AFTER FURTHER READING...I realize now for sure that I didn't get the camera I ordered.  I ordered GE J1455; I RECEIVED GE A1455.  After thinking this over, had I known I would get a camera with a 2.7inch LCD (although at a decent price) I think I would have just picked one up @ Wal-Mart or somewhere like that.  I'm afraid to try to have this situation corrected, though, since it's so close to Christmas.  (My plans are to give mom the camera a few days before Christmas so she can use it for the pics during the holidays.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow...I love it", "Author": "Bira \"bira\"", "ReviewID": "R3KY2A0JCS17U8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its very good camera from GE.
