Menus run deep, but navigation is ok. Remote is cheap and not sure how long it will last.I have not seen what a more expensive system looks like - although this was not at all cheap - but overall I am somewhat dissappointed in overall video quality. However, could be this is the best you get at this price point.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,440.00", "Features": "Complete Professional 16 Channel H.264 DVR with 10 x 1/3\" Exview HAD CCD II, Effio-E DSP Devices Camera. 700 TV lines, 2.8~12mm varifocal lens, 42pcs IR LED, 115 ft IR Distance. iPhone Viewing, Central Management System (CMS), Real Time Recording, Motion Detection Recording Function with Sensitivity Adjustment, USB Backup, VGA Monitor, PTZ Control\nDVR features:  16 Channel H.264 DVR Central Management System (CMS) iPhone Remote View PTZ Control Motion detection recording Manual/schedule/Motion Detection Recording Modes Time & date search easy access Live monitoring through internet from anywhere USB backup Easy navigation in OSD VGA output to LCD Monitor for better resolution\nGW30WD: Professional 1/3\" Exview HAD CCD II with Effio-E DSP Devices Camera. 700 TV lines, 2.8~12mm varifocal lens, 42pcs IR LED, 115 ft IR Distance.
