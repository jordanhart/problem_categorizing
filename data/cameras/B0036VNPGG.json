{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pros and Cons Make It Difficult to Give a Star-rating", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R37ZL8Q60RQTTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a small point-and-shoot camera that I could easily stash in my purse for quick snapshots, and I settled on the Olympus T-100 because of price and my outstanding experience with an Olympus Stylus.  I expected a no-frills camera with good optics and ease-of-use; I was looking for value and small size.  Although I got what I expected -- and for that the T-100 deserves a five-star rating--the camera has other limitations and flaws that consumers should weigh against the cost and the competition.  For many, this will be ideal in the price range, but some will want to look at other brands.Pros:  sharp 12 MP pictures in an inexpensive camera; rechargeable lithium battery (which some people may view as a con); a lens cover that is recessed when closed so that does not open easily if you accidentally brush against it; built-in flash that can be set to go off either automatically or only on demand; a sizable LCD screen for composing and viewing photos; the ability to focus on an object, then compose the photograph with it no longer in the center (shutter button halfway down before snapping); menu functions that actually work -- self-timer, macro, portrait, landscape, sports, etc. -- 21 in all; VGA movie mode to shoot brief videos; SDHC memory card-compatible (Olympus used to have their own XD card format); image stabilization; 3x zoom; ability to zoom in and out while shooting video; battery can be charged using either a regular outlet or a powered USB port; adjustable compression and picture quality settings.Cons:  the housing is mostly plastic, making it feel only one step up from a disposable camera; no memory card included; battery must charge inside camera, making it difficult to prepare extra batteries for a trip; battery does not arrive charged, so you'll have to wait for a few hours before you can try it out; with few outside buttons, most features need to be activated through the on-screen menu, making it cumbersome to switch from one to another; a somewhat thick body with rectangular corners on one side which makes it awkward to slip into a pocket; a user manual and software on CD that is only usable on a Windows machine; it takes a while to figure out the menu items.The camera comes with a lithium battery, a wrist strap; a charger with USB cable; and a software/manual disc that works only with Windows machines, no mention of which versions.  If you order this camera, you will also want to buy an SDHC card such as Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6.  This camera has been marketed as ideal for teenagers, primarily because of the cost but also because of the ease of use.  Of course, it also means that adults might be disappointed with its construction.  It is definitely not as high-tech/cool-looking as the other small point-and-shoots in the Nikon and Canon lines.  I'd give it 4 stars for the photographic quality, 3 stars for aesthetics and housing; 5 stars for value.For a generic, inexpensive spare battery and out-of-camera charger, check out GTMax LI-80B Replacement Battery+Battery Charger with Car Adapter+5FT USB Data Cable for Olympus T-100.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE", "Author": "ONSLO ERRENS \"ONS\"", "ReviewID": "R11AR6QS6Y3PWF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THIS CAMERA IS CONVENIENT IN SIZE.

I am trying to get this camera seviced but i wish I had read all of the reviews because I wouldn't have gotten it.  The first time I used it the battery died fast.  I took it on a trip and it conked out on me and now I went somewhere and was only able to take two pictures before the camera totaly shut down.  It won't even charge now and I can't get it turned off or on.  Don't buy this camera.  I will keep using my other little camera, the only reason I wanted this one was that it had a way to take movies and it had sound but that is useless if the darn thing doesn't even turn on.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buena Camara", "Author": "Daily Mota", "ReviewID": "R2IOQL1NB83KAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simplemente excelente camara y funcional.
