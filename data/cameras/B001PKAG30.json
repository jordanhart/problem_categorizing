I picked this one b/c it had the lithium-ion rechargeable battery and was 10 megapixel.  It's super easy to use and has great features.  I have taken some close ups of things (macro) and I'm blown away by the detail quality.  For [...] bucks, I don't know how you could beat this.  Some of the shots i've taken already look professional and I don't even really know how to fully use it yet.Great buy.THE ABOVE WAS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW.  BELOW IS THE UPDATE:This camera seemed fine for me at the time, but despite VERY LIGHT USE and always having it in a protective case and proper handling, it didn't even last a year and a half.  The lens wouldn't open and despite several attempts to fix it (using various methods found online as this is a common problem), nothing worked.  My option was to try to get it fixed for more than the camera is worth.  Now it is a $150 paper weight.  Complete junk.Bought a Canon PowerShot SX130 IS and am far happier:  better pics, better video, easier to use.  For lower end stuff like this, I would go with Canon.  While Nikon may make great high end cameras, their consumer grade stuff seems like junk.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor quality", "Author": "John Hayden", "ReviewID": "R1JTSIVII1GN14", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a little over a year and have not been impressed with the picture quality.

However, I definitely liked my older model better, despite the new one's sleek,  modern look.  It's less user friendly making the various settings harder to switch.  Also the camera's lcd screen has poor quality.  When the pictures are loaded onto your computer they look okay, but when you're taking the picture there are green spots and people are a bit washed out.  It works fine for me because I only wanted to cheap point and shoot to carry around with me wherever I go, but I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very pleased...", "Author": "A.

It takes great pictures once you get used to using all the settings. Like many others have said in their reviews, this is not an out of the box camera. You need to learn about the settings in order to get great pictures. The camera is certainly capable of great pictures, just take the time (it doesn't take all that long) to get familiar with your camera's abilities and you'll love it! And the color is BEAUTIFUL!

Now I know why.As a lifelong Nikon customer and former professional photographer, I can tell you that anyone who says this is a great camera is just plain ignorant or works for Nikon.This piece of crap cannot handle any lighting conditions, and I mean ANY lighting conditions. If it's too dark, both videos and stills are incredibly grainy, and the color reproduction is absolutely horrendous! Use the flash, and everything is washed out. If there is lots of light, it's STILL too grainy, colors are saturated to the point of looking like cartoons, and edges are broken up instead of solid lines. This is with all settings on \"Auto\". I tried \"Manual\" with the same results.The videos have lines and streaks throughout, and constant shifting colors in sunlight. I took a video in a park and half the grass and sky are YELLOW and the entire video has vertical lines running through it! My CELLPHONE takes better videos! 90% of the videos I took at a local water park are unuseable. The distortion (because the light is too bright) and grain makes it look like a kid's toy camera took the vids.Although they claim 10 Megapixels, I had a 1.3 Megapixel Olympus that took much, MUCH better pictures. I guarantee you will see ultra-saturated, runny colors, graininess that rivals most cellphones, and unbelievably poor edge definition.The \"features\" such as \"smile detection\" are just stupid! If you're too dumb to know when someone is smiling then you have no business owning a camera.I am so sorry I waited so long to test this thing! Now I can't take it back and I wouldn't have the heart to pawn it off on some other poor sucker. I can't emphasize enough what a waste of money this thing is.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cool Digital Camera for Beginners", "Author": "Bryan Carey \"Bryan Carey\"", "ReviewID": "RPPXZCTIC163X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nikon Coolpix S220 Digital Camera is a compact digital camera that makes a good camera choice for the first- time digital camera owner who is ready to get started in the world of digital photography but wants something that isn't priced too high or requires too much tech savvy. It is one of the smaller cameras available and it is offered at a price level that makes it ideal for the budget- minded consumer.Digital cameras are offered in many sizes and with many features and the Nikon Coolpix S220 Digital Camera is easily the smallest digital camera I have ever used. There are some cameras that are even smaller, but most are inadequate for my needs, due to their often tiny LCD viewing screen.  This camera offers an LCD screen that is large enough to easily see what you need to see so that picture taking is optimized. The size is sufficient enough that it doesn't hinder the taking of quality pictures.Picture quality is the most important feature of any digital camera and the Nikon Coolpix S220 Digital Camera does, indeed, take good pictures for a simpler camera. It also includes helpful features that produce better photographs, such as its image stabilization system. I also like the color options. Standard color is the option most photographers will use, but there is also a setting called Vivid Color. This option brightens the colors and in many ways, it reminds me of the colors common to a videotaped television program. However, one needs to be careful with this feature because I have found that it sometimes distorts the colors in certain situations. For example, outdoor pictures should not be taken using the Vivid Color option because it can result in a level of color that is a little unrealistic.Another picture taking aid with this camera is its Smart Portrait system. This includes features such as Smile Mode, which automatically snaps the picture when the subject is smiling; Built- in blink proofing, which snaps two pictures and deletes one of them if eyes are blinking; Face- Priority technology, which focuses quickly on faces and adjusts brightness so that faces look more natural; etc. These features are nice, but not always reliable. I have found, for example, that the blink- prevention feature doesn't always work. Sometimes, pictures get snapped anyway with the eyes of the subject shut. Of course, one can easily delete the picture and try again, but it would be nice if this technology was more predictable.The Nikon Coolpix S220 Digital Camera is a small digital camera, so it fits easily into one's shirt pocket or other small space. This is generally good, but it can also prove to be a problem. Because it is so small, it is easy to lose this camera. A camera this small and thin can fit into many places where other cameras will not fit, so you need to be careful where you leave it.Nikon makes some very good digital cameras and they also make a few average cameras. Nikon Coolpix S220 Digital Camera fits into the latter category. It is a good point and shoot digital camera, but it lacks the sophistication of other cameras and some of its features are inconsistent. Still, it's a decent beginner's camera and its small size and 10 megapixels make it a good choice for those new to the world of digital .", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great value for a good camera.", "Author": "Joe F. \"JoeF9000\"", "ReviewID": "R2RHTUY12OEHCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Nikon S220 is a good camera.

I was so happy with my old Nikon that when it accidently broke I wanted to stick with the brand so I bought a slightly better model.Unfortunately when I tried the camera I was horrified at the quality of the pictures. Pictures are blurry, soft, kind of foggy. I tried different settings, low ISO, natural light, flash, you name it. There's no crispness about them. The pictures this camera takes don't even look good on the LCD screen at the back of the camera!I was so unhappy I returned the camera first thing today and got a Canon IXUS 80IS which takes nice crispy photos.I still don't understand how the same company could produce a Nikon camera which cost me $80 2 years ago and took such terrific pictures out of the box with great crispness and great colours under many different conditions. Then 2 years later, another Nikon, twice as expensive as the first one, can produce photos of the same quality a disposable camera would. What went wrong in the process to get this camera out? Didn't anyone at Nikon realise this camera was going to be a failure?It may look compact, have nice features, but I would have thought picture quality was essential.

Unfortunately, after struggling with it for 6 weeks I returned it, since it's almost impossible to consistently take decent shots without a ton of digital noise (speckles / grain in the shot). My big clunky 10 year old Cannon G-shot takes far superior photos. Even my little Casio Exilim, which occasionally has focus issues, and which I bought the Nikon to replace, is way better. The Coolpix shots look a bit like those from my 7-year old's kid camera. There's no way I can use most of the photos I took, either on the auto settings, or when I tried to adjust them manually. Interestingly enough, when I took it back to Costco where I bought it, the camera guy checking in the return told me (quite casually), \"Oh yes, these are awful cameras.\" Don't waste your time & money.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "C.

It is by far the smallest and lightest camera, yet it is packed with features.The camera is less than 3/4 of an inch thick, only 3.5\" wide, and 2\" high. The controls are super easy to understand. With the battery and SD card installed it weighed in at only 4.1 ounces, about half the weight of my my Canon digital camera I bought earlier this year. Comparing the two side by side, the Canon is twice as thick.One way the weight and size is being reduced on the Nikon is they use aspecial rechargeable battery, the Nikon EN-EL10 Lithium-ion Battery for Nikon Coolpix S600, S520 & S210, or the generic equivalent being the Maximalpower DB OLY LI40B/42B Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Olympus Li-40B,Li-42B, Kodak KLIC7006,FUJI NP45, Nikon EN-EL10,Pentax D-Li63. The battery is not quite as convenient as AA's, but it does save on the weight and is conveniently rechargeable.I found the camera did an excellent with outdoor shots, even when using the zoom lens at its maximum power. However, indoors the camera did not handle indoor photos as well as the Canon. The pictures were still pretty good, just not as good as I was getting with the other camera.The camera comes with 44 MB of internal memory, which allowed me to take 28 pictures at 10 mp before needing an SD card.Two really cool features on this camera are the panorama assist which allows you to take pieces of a panoramic picture by overlapping your last shot so you can take consecutive shots and join them together later in the included Panorama Maker which is included with the software CD.Another interesting feature is the Best Shot Selector. When this is selected, the camera will rapidly take 10 photos, and automatically save the sharpest one. The only downside is that I would like to review the 10 pictures and personally select the one I like the best.The camera can use up to a 16 GB SDHC card. Surprisingly, for it's small size, it also has a tripod mount.If you're looking for a lightweight camera that is big on features and low in price, this might be the perfect camera for you. It also comes in a variety of fun colors such as red, magenta, blue, green, black, and silver.I would also recommend ordering the Transcend 4 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] , which will hold hundreds of photos.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S220", "Author": "C.

What others here are complaining about in terms of picture quality, or lack of, can easily be corrected by referring to your User's Manual (p.93)!  In 'Auto' mode go to 'Menu' and 'Image Mode' to select 'High (3648*)' for even better quality photos.  ('10m*' should then show in your monitor window during shooting, lower right).  This mode will use up much more memory on your memory card due to increasing compression ratio, though it's worth every pixel.  Set ISO to '80' and Color options to 'Vivid' (B&W; is fun too).  Hope this helps.Really, this teeny little point & shoot camera does very well for it's size and price, which is why I bought it... to shove in my pocket, toss in my purse, and/or to let my kids use.

The other 113 went into the trash. The macro settings are terrible; You will always need keep it in full force zoom. Micro settings are fine, but you can't be any further than 3 feet away from the subject. Don't bother turning the flash off. You'll get distorted, infared looking photos that look like they were taken in 1920. The 6 decent pictures I got were outdoors in beaming sunlight with the flash on and the closest zoom possible. And even then the results were erratic. You will see very little improvement, if any, with the \"enhanced\" settings maxed out. Awful, simply awful.

I don't get what people see in this series, and I would avoid it at all costs.The ONE positive thing I can say about it is the battery life is good. It's worth more than the camera itself. This camera is a waste of money, and I would feel bad reselling it to someone who didn't know any better. Not worth more than $20.00 unopened. This camera will do one of two things: Destroy your faith in Nikon, or send you back to the store demanding a refund with a tantrum. Hopefully you'll at least do the latter. Dig deeper, and go with a 12 MP with at least a 4X zoom. Kodak beat this by a longshot. I'd even recommend a 3 MP camera over this.I wish I had read these reviews before buying this.

As far as looks go, I'm pretty smitten with it. The lcd is large and crisp, the controls are incredibly user friendly, and it takes wonderful point and shoot pictures. There are a million settings you can use from fireworks to food, but they're mostly kind of useless and don't look much different from the auto function. The photos are generally crisp and accurate, though I've experienced some bizarre color casts. I spent some time in a blacksmith shop, and all the rust came out bright yellow instead of rust-colored, which is not something easy to fix in photoshop. Also, I spend a lot of time with the macro lens, which I've been underwhelmed with. The focus is fairly far away- a good 6 inches, and even from there it's usually blurry by the time I crop it. Otherwise, though, I've been happy with contrast and color vibrancy. It really does do a good job for the price.So all in all, I'd say it's a very appropriate camera for the non-professional without a lot of money. I hate to admit that I fall into the group of consumers that buy something because it looks pretty, but if that's one of your requirements-go for it.

After having owned it for a year now, I can say that it's definitely a solid camera at a decent price. The picture quality, in our experience, is vastly superior to our previous 7 MP camera. On 10 MP, we've only had a few pics turn out blurry, with the vast majority being crystal clear. The recording capabilities are on par with what we expected - you're not going to be able to record a hard rock concert with this, but for everyday use it gets the job done. The battery holds its charge fairly well, and after losing the original charger that came with the camera, we were able to find a cheap non-OEM charger that has worked well. The one thing that scares me with this camera is the amount of \"Lens Error\" complaints it has received. We've been taking good care of it, and (thankfully) haven't seen any errors of any sort in the year we've owned it. Hoping that it stays that way, as I'd like to get another couple years of use out of it.Overall, especially since the price has come down some, I give the Nikon Coolpix S220 a solid recommendation.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R1EQQACAOR9VQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought this camera over a year ago....sorry for the delay on review ...but was a fantastic Xmas gift and an Awesome camera for the price.

I got into several embarrassing situations when I took pictures (at parties) with this camera, only for my friends to make a comment such as \"what is wrong with your camera bro\", and for one of them to take a better picture with their Canon or Kodak camera.

It is not, however, the best in low light situations without using the flash.You can read the manual, but I find the best way to learn to use any camera like this is to play with all the settings.Are your images grainy? Press the \"Menu\" button and select \"Scene,\" then image mode, then select a higher quality image mode. I use normal, but you could bump it up to High if you wish. The higher the quality image the larger the photo file size, meaning you'll have less space on the SD card for a lot of photos.Do you find that the LCD screen is too dark or too bright? You can adjust it. Press Menu again and select the tool that looks like a wrench. You'll find all sorts of controls that you can adjust to your preferences. And of course this is where you'll find the \"format\" card command... Every time you delete your photos from the camera's memory it's wise to format the card.Now for the \"Scene\" command button, which is just to the upper left of the four-way command control. You can leave it on Auto, or... use the four-way command control to select \"Scene.\" Then cycle through the many choices, including portrait, sports (fast action shots) landscape, beach, snow, museum, Subway, Pizza Hut, etc..:)If you and your subject are standing in the shade, and sunlight is behind your subject, you may want to experiment with \"Forced Flash\" mode. This will cause the camera flash to turn on no matter what and will properly illuminate your subject's face so it doesn't end up looking dark with a bright background. Press the four-way command button, the up button with the image of a lighting bolt. Cycle down to the lighting bolt and you'll be in forced flash mode. Check out the other flash modes while your there.Wanna make a video? the \"Scene\" button and cycle down to \"Movie\" and your camera becomes a video camera...  (You can also use the camera as a voice recorder!).Have you been disappointed about the quality of indoor photos of friends/family etc. because the flash illuminated their faces way way way too much? Here's a photo trick I often use indoors: Step back three or four or five or six feet from where you had planned to take the photo. Then zoom in just to the point where you would have been standing, and then take the photo! You'll get a more evenly balanced facial tone and even capture more of the background that would tend to have be washed out when standing too close to your subjects. (You can also try the \"party\" mode - using the Scene button to access all of the special selections)If you'd like to take really really close-up photos, of say Abe Lincoln's face on a penny.. Select \"Macro\" mode. There are two ways to activate it. One is by pressing the Scene button then cycling down to \"scene\" then cycle to the right and select the icon of the two tulips...Or, you can leave the setting on \"auto\" and using the down command button, which shows the image of those tulips again, press and select \"on\" for macro close-up mode.As with all cameras of their ilk, when you don't have a viewfinder to look through on a sunny day, you have to rely on the LCD screen, which can be impossible to see in bright light.That's about it... other than it uses a special Mini B to USB cable.

I found the controls less than intuitive, though, and I don't know how to do all that I want to do with the camera or all that it's capable of doing. I suppose a more experienced photographer would suss it out without thinking, but then, an experienced photographer is probably not buying a starter camera like this.I am profoundly disappointed that after a mere four months the screen's gone blank. It still takes pictures -- but nothing shows in the screen. I can't see what I'm framing, I can't see the shot after I've taken it, I can't review the shots. The screen is either blank white or sometimes a flickering grayscale. A search of the web has not turned up any information about dead screens that I can find. I really think the lifespan of an inexpensive camera ought to be more than four months.There is no visible damage to the screen, so no obvious explanation for why the screen doesn't work.

I bought this camera to shot some pictures but also to be able to make a short video shots. Well, after couple videos it appeared that the camera records poor quality videos especially in outdoor conditions where there is a lot of bright light. Recorded video had half screen yellow with pink straps and the rest of it was with a normal color.Pictures taken with this camera are OK, although AF could work better. Automatic scene selection works fine but I'd prefer more manual setup. So, overall the camera performs well, besides this movie making aspect which in my case was pretty important. That was the main reason for which I have returned the camera to Amazon.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor image quality", "Author": "Bhargava", "ReviewID": "R1WEC9XUXBFKGL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The image quality of this camera sucks.
