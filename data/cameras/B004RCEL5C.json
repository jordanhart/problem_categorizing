I am overall happy about my purchase although the title description is definitely misleading, it clearly says \"SLR Digital Camera w/ Canon 18-55mm Lens + 3 Extra Lens\" and if you read the description it only lists 3 lenses total. I have been disappointed by the telephoto and wide angle but having two additional batteries makes up for that, the flash is super cheap I probably will never use it, the tripods are nice to have but will never let go of my camera and have it sitting alone on it (again cheap but you get what you pay for). The bag that comes with is okay for temporary use but I am looking at buying another because it does not hold everything. The close up kit and filters I'm still playing around with trying to figure out if I like them or not. The additional  charger and the memory card are definitely worth while. I'm sure I am forgetting something, but all in all you get what you pay for, its a descent starter kit, oh and one last thing don't expect anything but what comes with the camera body to be cannon brand everything else is off brand (which I'm no label girl, but its made super cheap, so it'll do for now but the accessories definitely won't last you a life time).", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a first time DSLR", "Author": "Happy Customer", "ReviewID": "R1SB6YYBVL9WZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this package for my wife for Christmas.  It was a great deal considering everything that came with it.  The accessories were not top of the line or anything, but they were much better than expected and much better than I read about in reviews of similar packages from other vendors. The rapid charger was a really nice addition. It only took about 3 hours to charge the battery and, after about 1000 pictures taken since Christmas, we still have yet to charge the battery a second time. The memory card is Class 10 so it has no problems recording video and 32gb will hold thousands of pictures (5,000+). The mini tripod is not really stable with this camera and I'm sure would not work with a telehoto lens on the camera, but the 50\" tripod is very nice. The legs are aluminum and all of the pressure fittings are plastic, but it is still very sturdy. The pressure fittings hold nicely so you don't have to tighten anything down too tight to get the camera to stay put and there's a level on the camera platform so you can get the camera level. The telephoto and the wide angle lens attachments work well and with manual focus take pretty clear pictures. The slave flash works nicely as well. Very bright and very easy to use. The carrying was really the only disappointment. The bag is very big. We were able to put everything into the bag that came with this package (less the 50\" tripod), but the interior space was not easily compartmentalized so the camera doesn't fit as snug as I would like.The camera itself is very easy to use for point and shoot, but also very adjustable for the knowledgable user. The pictures are very bright and vibrant. A vast improvement over our last camera without being too terribly expensive. Plus, the DSLR body is easily (although not cheaply) upgraded with the addition of true telephoto and wide angle lenses. The autofocus works very well, but the big seller is the image stabilizer. I took a photo with a 6\" shutter time without a tripod and the picture came out clear (the subject was stationary, but I don't have the steadiest of hands so this was very impressive to me).The combination of accessories and settings with the camera have given hours of entertainment and allow for a great deal of creativity with photography. We haven't even tried out the image software that came with the camera so I'm sure there will be many more hours of fun in store. Overall, this is a great camera for the price and a great way to make the step to DSLR.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!!!", "Author": "C. Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R4QEIQK8AIWK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing camera for the price! If you need a quick small easy to luge around camera this is it! I got it for my photography business. I needed something small easy to use to bring for small mini shoots, like newborn or for the reason I got it was for October photos and my camera was getting fixed so it was a back up... Everyone wants cute kids in their customs photos, so this was a nice kit that came with a lot of extra things that I needed any ways. The tri pod I cant say for since I gave that to my sister since I had a better one I bought prior... The filters are amazing and worked with all my Canons... the bag is small but works if you use it for JUST this kit... anything else you may have the bag will not hold it... Lens is ok... but like I said for starters or just a quick fix until your gets fixed it does the job... cleaning kit was ok, and everything else well it does it job ;  The Flash is a little cheap thats why I gave it 4 starts... I took for ever for the camera to even realize it was there, I never use it because it was cheap... Other then that the camera is amazing, love every bit of it... I have a Canon T3i that was getting fixed and this camera is almost just a good... MP is only 12 but you really cant tell the difference... Again I am in love with it...", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, but skip the extras", "Author": "Julia Sirotin \"Model\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZQYTXM4XPKQS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this camera, its very lightweight and captures great images.  Battery life (as in all canons - is amazing).  After looking for a while, I chose to get this package because it seemingly came with all the extras I would need to start out in DSLR world.  However I wish I just got a refub body directly from the Canon website for a lot less than this package cost and then spend the extra $ on getting the extra pieces that I actually need and better quality.  Lets be realistic here - these value-adder packages rarely if ever add any true value.  The flash it came with broke (bulb blew out) the first day I tested it out, after going off just 15 times.  The tripod is very lightweight and great for travel, however the release tabs are all plastic and the rivets that hold them together are very loose - so now the tripod collapses even if there's no weight on it - not going to trust a camera on it, and so it went in the trash after 5 uses.  The memory card they sent, that I was using inside this camera crashed on me in the middle of my vacation and I had to get a replacement (at 500% retail markup) at a CVS. Thankfully I was able to recover all the images once I got home, however its not a class 10 card like it should be. The polarizing filter is mediocre at best, does not work well for city haze or sunlight.  The mini tripod is useless for the DSLR as it is too small, however works great with a small point-and shoot.  The macro and wide angle lenses vignette too much and reduce image quality, however you can achieve some interesting effects if you tried.  When on the go, I've never bothered with them as they are more trouble than they're worth to me.  The camera bag is good and fits most of the things that come in this package.  However I have since upgraded to a much better padded camera backpack.  I will probably never use the extra batteries or charger that came with it after seeing how low quality the rest of the items are, I'd be worried about it damaging the camera.  Overall - just get your camera from Canon directly, and buy the rest of your accessories on Amazon!", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value GREAT COMPANY", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "RXVDQXCPPO5X1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my Christmas gift to myself.

I'm still trying to get adjusted to the camera settings and how to use it. It came with 3 different batteries which is amazing if your doing a long shoot you have plenty of power and juices.The bad, some of the attachments in the kit were not in the best of condition. One of the filters the glass in the actual lens is loose and flops around. The tripod is very flimsy and is not an acceptable tripod to be used with the DSLR it seems very unstable and does not sit level. The high speed USB attachment is probably the best thing in this whole package because i have used that more than i ever imagined that i would.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Julabug99", "ReviewID": "R2AQYMWBLS2VWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremely pleased with this purchase!
