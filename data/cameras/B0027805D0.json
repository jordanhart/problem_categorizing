{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible Product Quality and Customer Service", "Author": "Jaxbells \"Jaxbells\"", "ReviewID": "R3DJ6URNFMU30H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S930 in mid April of this year and by our trip in June, the lens cover would not open properly, rendering the camera inoperable.  When we contacted Sony, we were advised that it had a 1 year warranty.  We sent the camera in a few months later, only to learn that it was actually out of warranty (apparently the warranty was actually only 90 days, not 1 year). Based upon Sony's representation that it was a 1 year period, we did not send the camera in right away (I detest taking 3 kids to the post office IYKWIM).  To make matters worse, Sony wanted to charge far more than the original cost of the camera to repair it.  We have evidence that the camera was not working in June (well within the warranty period), but Sony simply would not budge.  We wasted our valuable time and money purchasing a defective camera that worked just over a month and sending the camera in to the repair center.  Quality issues happen with all manufacturers.  The key is how the company responds.  Needless to say, we are deeply disappointed with Sony's quality and customer service.  We simply refuse to buy Sony again based upon this experience.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0027805D0"}}
