I didn't take it on my introductory scuba dive, because we were gooing too deep, but used it quite a bit onboard and while snorkeling. It worked GREAT!!! I was glad that I purchased an extra battery, because we took hundreds of pictures, literally. The only downside that I've found is that when you first turn it on, there is an almost 30 second wait to take the first pic, perhaps because I'm using a 16 gb memory card?? When I get home, I'll buy a smaller card and see if it helps. The seller that I bought this from, City Supplies, was great also!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "c-how_iloveyou.", "ReviewID": "R22PE9RLXHD6MI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews on waterproof cameras I was worried if this purchase was even really worth it but it's awesome! The indoor pictures turn out great also! AllAboutElectronics is great to work with...they responded to my many questions promptly.
