{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what I wanted", "Author": "Hoke", "ReviewID": "R9L1NE2YYK8CA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I would like to say that I am just an average camera user with no special skills and I really do not understand what any of the jargon means when people talk about their cameras.I was interested in this camera for several reasons:1. It was highly rated in every review I read about it by people that know a whole lot more about such things than me.2. It uses 2 AA batteries not 4 and not a rechargeable battery.  I use rechargeable AA batteries on my own.  I really do not like being forced to use the ones provided with the cameras.  No matter what they say the batteries will run out and at the most inconvenient time.  I can swap the batteries out in an instant or buy new ones.  You can't do that with other rechargeable batteries.  I travel a lot.  I never know if I will have access to electricity to recharge my camera or if I will even have time.  For this reason I absolutely insist on AA batteries.  This may not be a concern for your standard user but it is to devoted travelers.3.  I am not that obsessed with photography.  I wanted a camera that would work \"out of the box\" and let me learn about the features as I go.4.  It uses an SD disk.  This allows me to use the same disks without buying new ones or buying an adapter for my computer.  I can use the same SD discs with my mp3 player and my palm pilot.  This is why I refuse to buy items using xd discs or anything by Sony and their insane use of their memory stick.  Hey Sony the Beta was great but no one bought it.  You are going down the same path with your memory stick.  The deciding factor between a Sony computer and the Gateway I bought was the memory stick feature versus an SD drive.  I did not buy cameras from Sony twice now because of the use of memory sticks.  I have told many people about this and have steered them to other brands for the same reason.  Compatabilty is very important in electronics.5.  It has lots of cool accessories that I may or may not eventually decide to buy.  The main one being the waterproof case.  I tried this out at the camera store and it was really cool.  It allows divers full access to all of the features on the camera and seems like it is really easy to use.  I will be buying it in a month or so for an upcoming diving trip.  I will know better after that if it works in the water as well as in the camera store.6.  It has a separate watch battery to store the date and time information.  That was a major issue I had with my last camera.  Digital cameras go through batteries fast.  Having to constantly enter this information gets annoying, especially if I am not wearing a watch.These are my initial thoughts after purchase:Setting up the camera was a snap.  Everything seemed intuitive and I had no problems whatsoever.I have taken a few test shots in the various modes and am really impressed.  It has a lot of detail that my previous camera did not provide.The camera seems to be the perfect size for me.  This camera is big enough so that you can operate the buttons without getting a 4 year old to do it for you.  And small enough that it can be used as a handheld camera, fitting nicely in a case around your shoulder.My only complaint on this camera and with a lot of them is the wheel that switches the modes.  I really wish they would make these things flush with the camera body.  This one is better than my previous camera but the wheel still shifts modes when you pull it out of its case.  Other than that one minor gripe I am very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Actually 4.5, but that wasn't an option", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"L.P.\"", "ReviewID": "R1ENIZDBZNGJ02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched digital cameras for over two weeks and finally decided on the Canon A710 IS for a couple reasons.  One)it offered the 2nd largest optical zoom, only surpassed by Panasonic right now.  Two) the sharpness and quality of the canon images. Three) the Image Stabalizer (IS), which is absolutely the best on the market right now. I shook my hand violently while I snapped a picture and it was crisp and clear. Warning: the IS does not work as spectacularly with flash, nor would any other IS system, because the camera sets the shutter speed lower to get enough light in and this effects the IS capability.  Still works well, though.  Four) This Canon camera is sleek, easy to hold, easy to use menu features, manual options, and lots of cool extras (I love the color accent feature). And five) because of all of the excellent reviews on this particular camera.  Pros, cnet, customers, everyone had something positive to say and very few negatives.I wanted a camera to capture our first child (Simba, a Shiba dog)and our future first child (hopefully in the next year) when they are active, indoor low-light shots of when we are hanging out with our friends, and have the instant on-hand video camera to catch exciting moments.  This camera does all that and more!  Very impressed with low-light pictures but was hoping for slighly less red eye (hard to get less red eye, though, with where such small cameras have to place the flash).I was really torn between this one, the Fuji Finepix F30, the Panasonic Lumix TZ1, and the Canon SD800IS.  We had a Fuji before that lasted forever and the F30 is said to take the best indoor, low-light photos available in a digital camera right now, but it was hard to find customer reviews on this camera and the optical zoom was only 3x.  The Panasonic has the highest optical zoom at 10X, and customer reviews said it was very impressive but I saw quite a few reviews regarding problems in the first few months and a short warranty along with bad customer service. And nothing was said about low-light images, though Panasonic images just aren't as clear and crisp as Canon's.In the end, I decided the extra megapixel was not worth the lower optical zoom, so I went with this one over the 800IS.I have attached some pictures to view.I am very very impressed with this camera. I viewed my pictures hooked up to a 64\" TV and they were awesome. The video is also great quality; my stepdad is considering this digital camera with a large memory card instead of getting a new video camera, he was so impressed.The camera is extremely easy to use and comfortable to grip.  The only thing I have to complain about is that I am nervous about the error 08 that people have said causes the camera to stop working and the lens to not retract.  However, this was not enough to stop me from purchasing it.  This is something any camera could have happen if grain or dirt blocks the lens shutting and canon customer service assured me that if it did happen, they would repair it free of cost to me (I would have to pay shipping).  Best way to avoid this, keep in a case.I have had it for 4 months and have had zero problems.It uses 2 AA batteries (great for me cause they can be found anywhere) and I played with the camera for almost 2 straight days before they died (lots of pics and video and viewing on screen).Also, my stepmother has the Canon 600.  She dropped it and it fell down about 20 feet, hitting multiple rocks along the way.  When recovered, the LCD screen was broken so the menu cannot be viewed, but the camera still works and still takes great photos!  Amazingly durable.I would recommend checking out [...] for more info.UPDATE: I don't know if it was summer and I just wasn't taking many indoor photos or if my \"Auto\" setting has changed itself, but I am not getting very clear pictures inside anym ore.  Maybe my hand is shaking more but with the IS feature, this shouldn't be a big deal. I have added some pictures that aren't as sharp as before so you can see what I am talking about.  I am still happy with my camera but now I will have to toy with all the setting features to see if I can get better inside people shots.  Either my subjects have bad red eye, are slightly blurred, or just not clear when I zoom in on my computer (even when the pics were taken at highest resolution.  I will update if I fix this problem.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera but buy stock in a battery company", "Author": "Rick Kaneen \"PrPro\"", "ReviewID": "R1SODA3KI8FKS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon has an excellent rep with its digital cameras and the A710 is one of the latest in that long line. It's a great camera...not too small to handle with but small enough to be slipped into a jacket pocket. The zoom works well and the stabilization keeps zoomed photos clear, although a bit grainy at full zoom. Syncing with the computer couldn't be easier...load the included software and you're ready to go. I couldn't believe how easy it was to do this. As stated by another reviewer, the included 16mb card is almost worthless, but I used it to practice and get the hang of the camera operation before loading up a 1 gb card. I took the camera on a week and a half vacation and loved it. At the touch of a button I can see how many shots I have left on the card and how many I'll have if I adjust the size and detail of the photos. This let me reduce photo quality just a bit to get the last few photos at the end of the vacation onto the card. Zoom is quick, but, as stated in another review, the flash recharge takes a few seconds. The large LCD screen is great, but, like most digitals, difficult to see in bright light. This makes the optical viewfinder a god-send, but be aware that the viewfinder shows you a tighter shot that what is really being captured in the photo(watch out for the trend from other camera manufacturers of dropping the optical viewfinder!). There are a multitude of optional settings that I'm still figuring out. One - the night shot setting - is questionable. I get better night time shots with the setting on 'automatic' that I do using the 'night shot' setting.My only problem with the A710 is battery life. Even with the power save function on, I went through a set of batteries a day. Obviously, using the flash a lot reduces battery life and I took many photos inside buildings. I also took 50-60 photos a day, so I was working the batteries from sun-up to sun-down and sometimes after that (I took 600+ photos in 10 days of travel). Rechargables are probably a good idea, but traveling in Europe complicates that....you need to carry a Euro style plug in addition to the battery charging apparatus and lugging all that would be just about as bad as dragging around my big, old Pentax film SLR (the main point, for me, of going digital was to reduce the size and weight of taking the film camera on an extended vacation). The need for all the batteries is the only reason I don't give the A710 5 stars and that's probably not really fair considering the number of photos I'm taking and the conditions of flash use.In conclusion - The A710 takes great photos, is easy to use, figure out, and connect to your computer, has all the features a non-professional photog could want  has the megapixels to let you enlarge your photos to at least 8x10 and is reasonably priced. If you can live with replacing batteries frequently in heavy-use situations, I doubt you can do better in this price range than this camera.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck!", "Author": "L. DeGolia", "ReviewID": "ROP18V014PW1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hope you like this camera as much as I do!I spent about three solid days online/in store researching camera's before I decided that this was the camera for me. There were three things that I really wanted from a new camera: better zoom, image stabilization, and better quality pics. I believe I got all of this and more in this little camera.First, most camera's on the market have a 3X optical zoom- this one has 6x, which gives you a better quality picture further away. I realize there are other camera's on the market that have a better zoom ability, but I did not want to jeopardize size, I wanted something close to \"pocket sized.\"Second, the image stabilization feature is great- especially at night when you are trying to take photo's of buildings, etc. Regardless of how steady my hand was with my last digital, I could never get a night shot to come out- not a problem with the A710.Third, the quality of pictures this camera offers is superb. I have no complaints on the ease of taking pictures. While there are quite a few different settings to choose from, the \"basic\" manual explains each one in an easy to follow manner (and I am not directions reader).I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an easy use, high quality camera. Everything you need comes in the box, you can literally pop the batteries and memory card in and you are set. There are many camera's that have a lot of great options out on the market, but I believe this to be the best.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera, great IS, little quircks", "Author": "James Yoneda", "ReviewID": "RT5S1HF7386PN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a Canon SD600 Digital Elph camera for Christmas.  This is after owning and using a SD30 for about 4 years, give or take.  I was deciding between getting the A710, or a Casio Z70/700 or similar.  I decided on Canons, due to supposedly higher image quality.  The Casio's have great/fast interfaces.I got my A710 from Amazon, and thought \"I can't wait till it's charged and I can use it\".  Then I remembered, it uses normal batteries!  At first I didn't like this, since I liked the easily rechargeable battery from my older S30.  However, I love the normal batteries now; they're easy to replace if you need to, and I can keep multiple pairs for charging (great for trips).  Plus, no special charge to misplace all the time.The IS is why I bought this camera.  It seems most of the available cameras (when I was looking, Christmas '06) don't include Image Stabilization (IS).  This is the part I love most!  When I'm moving the camera, it's almost eerie and disconnected since the picture doesn't move when I'm shaking the camera (including intentionally shaking the camera like I've eaten too much sugar/caffeine).  You can definitely notice, especially on movies where normal camera shake have rendered other movies unusable.  The IS is great!The LCD is good, noticeably better than the Exilim's I've seen and used.  It's bright enough, though hard to see in the bright sun.  For those situations, I've found myself using the viewfinder.  The higher-end exilims without the viewfinders are supposed to have incredibly bright LCD's, still usable in the bright sun.The shot quality is amazing, much better than my old S30.  Even a lot of higher-megapixel cameras simply don't look it, as their shots are fuzzy, have chromatic aberation (purple fringing), and bad color.  This camera shoots great pictures, and has rekindled my love of taking quick snapshots.The camera is quick from startup and shot-to-shot, with the exception of using the flash.  I don't use the flash much, due mostly to the fact that the old S30 looked horrible with the flash on (overexposed everything, no matter what the manual settings).  The flash on the A710 looks great, but it adds a delay.  You take a picture with flash, can review the picture right away (hold the button down if you want to review it for a while).  As soon as the review is gone, the LCD turns off for 4-5 seconds to recharge the flash.  First time this happened, I thought I'd broken the camera.  It's annoying, and is the one huge flaw on this camera.  I imagine it's due to the camera using 2 AA batteries instead of 4 like older A-series Canon's.The movie mode looks fantastic (I would definitely consider using this instead of a non-HD camcorder) except that the files are huge (125mb per minute... no MPEG-4 here!).  I really wish Canon would get onto the MPEG-4 bandwagon, like the Exilim's.  A 1gb card does 8 minutes, a 4gb card a half-hour.  You can pull quality down, but it's just a shame it doesn't do MPEG4.  However, the sheer quality of the video is excellent, and makes for a good quick clip (30 seconds, couple minutes) feature.It's smaller than I thought, less bulge due to using 2 AA's instead of 4.  The lens doesn't protrude any more than the handle bulge, and it's comfortable to hold.  The interface is nice, easy to change most items from a couple of menus.Battery life for me has be very impressive... about 300-400 pictures so far on my single set of AA 2800mah NIHM batteries from Walmart.  I decided to use the camera until they die... they still haven't yet!  I keep getting the low-battery warning, but they just never quit.  I've got little energizer bunnies in there or something.  The bundled Alkaline's died after the first 100-200 pictures, still pretty decent.  About on par with what I got from my old S30, which wasn't great on the included Li-Ion battery anyway.The only things I'd change are the blank-LCD-delay after flash photos, and the extremely huge but nice video clips.  Definitely recommended for a good mid-range point-and-shoot semi-manual.

It's easy to use right out of the box and the picture quality is very good.  I like the 6x optical zoom and the IS really helps with the camera shake, especially when using the zoom.  The movie mode is very nice as well.  The camera is big enough to feel right in my hand yet small enough to easily slip into a sweatshirt pocket or purse.  My two  complaints are: the camera ships with a 16 MB SD card-which is a joke, and battery life seems fairly short. Investing in rechargables would be a good idea. I'm now using a 1 GB Ultra II SD card with great results.

I have a Pentax K100 DSLR and it is gathering dust because its kit lens colors are inferior to this little Canon.Resolution is very good at ISO 80-200.  I generally just leave it on 80 most of the time.  With the image stabilizer, I can take handheld pictures in available light down to 1/5 second at least.The meter will always blow highlights, I just leave it on -1/3 and all is well.White balance is fairly decent outdoors, needs to be set manually if you're picky indoors.I love all the other manual tweaks:  manual exposure, color ranges from screaming vivid to insipid neutral, black and white and sepia, the ability to change contrast and sharpness and saturation.  I have sharpening set to -2 since their algorithm tends to oversharpen things like landscapes with a lot of detail.  I have never used Auto mode, but the Portrait mode produced excellent reduced depth of field as long as you remember to use the lens at maximum telephoto and try to fill the viewfinder with your subject.The flash recycling time is horrible, but if you have a lot of time and want to illuminate something standing still, its coverage is decent.Battery life is great.  I get about 200 or so shots with rechargeable AAs.The best thing about this camera is that it lives in my pocket and can be taken anywhere so I not only never miss a shot, but have infinite opportunities to learn and grow as a photographer with shots I never thought I would take.It would be wonderful to have a swivel screen, but Canon never listens to its customers.However, if you have more guts than me and can get in people's faces, this truly is the poor man's Leica for the early twenty-first century.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Superb middle-of -the-road compact", "Author": "Eric T. Ford", "ReviewID": "R22K46L6331PW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The A710 falls into a strange niche -- that is, it has no niche. It has a long zoom range, but not the screaming 12x reach of a superzoom. It has image stabilization but it lacks the larger, 10mp sensor of other new compacts. It's smaller and cheaper than the G7, but has fewer features, too. It has more features than an ultra-compact, but it's not as pocketable. The A710 does everything great, but it doesn't have a specific top feature to distinguish it from the rest of the pack.But it's an excellent camera. 6x optical zoom is plenty unless you're shooting a football game from the back row. The lens has little distortion or fringing -- issues I read about all the time with superzooms. The meter is fine, with hardly any highlight clipping if you leave exposure compensation at -2/3. That great vagary, \"image quality,\" is first rate as far as I'm concerned.The A710 fits in a pant or jacket pocket. It gives you wide and easily accessed control over everything from saturation and tone to ISO and white balance. The full manual setting is a lifesaver when the program modes can't get the exact look you want. The menu system is logical, fast, and unobtrusive.Photos print great up to 8x10\", as you'd expect from a 7mp camera. Because it's so many pixels on such a small sensor, you'll see some noise in the shadows and some details will be smeared by noise reduction even at the base ISO of 80 -- photograph a forest and you'll see what I mean -- but that's true of all compacts. I wouldn't use ISO 800 unless printing smaller. Fortunately, image stabilization allows you to keep the ISO at 400 or lower even indoors. 4x6\" prints from ISO 400 aren't noisy to my eyes, but it depends on the subject. On a computer screen, ISO 400 is really noisy, but that's blown up to sizes you'd never print at.Flash recharge is slow, but that's the trade-off for using only 2 AA batteries (I should note that battery life is bad, as with all 2 AA battery cameras). I think flash usually looks ugly indoors anyway, so unless you shoot backlit subjects all the time, this issue won't be crippling. Without flash, shot-to-shot time is good. The LCD screen is good, too. I've read many complaints about its uselessness in bright light, but I never had this problem. If you're taking pictures in such blinding conditions they'll be over-exposed and probably not that great anyway.Extra features like color accent and widescreen mode are cute and work well. The video is very good, especially because it's image stabilized -- on my computer monitor it looks better than 8mm video does on my TV, and for less money than a camcorder. The files are huge, though.In my opinion, if you want top performance on any feature from zoom to low-light shooting, you should save for a DSLR. They get smaller, less expensive, and more useful every year. Getting a more expensive or bigger compact camera won't get you there, so you might as well keep your expectations realistic. It depends on what's important to you. If you want huge zoom, get a superzoom; if you want a camera you could do magic tricks with, get an ultracompact; this camera will do everything else in a low-priced, small package. Every camera has compromises. This model fits right there in the middle of it all. It's great at what it does.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Loving our new camera!", "Author": "Bonnie \"bon\"", "ReviewID": "R320G7CH34TBRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before replacing our old digital camera, I did research online, checking customer reviews and camera-review websites before I decided to get this one.  The deciding factors for us were:- cameras with 10-megapixels appear to be overkill unless you have a really expensive camera to take full advantage, and I think this camera's 7.1 megapixels are plenty for us to get great photo resolution for our needs,- the zoom is super for taking pix at my son's athletic events,- image stabilization (IS) is a feature highly recommended on camera review websites,- it can be a fully automatic point-and-shoot, or I can adjust settings for different effects and results,- it had good ratings for use as a short-video camera (which we need but not enough to buy a separate video camera at this time).Amazon had the best price, free shipping, no tax, and I now see that the post-holiday price is even better than what we paid a month ago.The camera is small enough to stick in a pocket if you want, but big enough that my husband and I can both use it easily.  It has a nice heft and solid feel.  The right side protrudes to allow for the battery compartment and that makes the difference between a secure grip and a tenuous one.  The LCD screen is nice and big, too, covering about 3/4 of the back of the camera.We are on set #3 of batteries after fairly light use, but so far I have spent less time taking pictures and more time going through the manual and playing with the camera settings to learn the bells and whistles.  I hope I will get more pictures per battery once I learn what I want to learn.  But so far, battery usage is my only complaint and not a major one.  We have a great padded camera case with zipper pockets to carry extra batteries.  (It's an M-Rock case purchased from a 3rd party seller through Amazon... if you need a camera case, ours is beyond great and was relatively inexpensive).  The SD card that comes with the camera is barely enough to take some test pictures at medium resolution, so be sure to get one with more capacity, like 1GB.So far I've most enjoyed the color adjustments this camera offers.  I can sample any color and take a photo which is all black and white except for that color (i.e. red flowers in a b/w photo).  Or, I can intensify either blues, reds, or greens to make that color really pop.  Also, there are white-balance settings for different lighting conditions (daylight, cloudy, flourescent light, etc) if the auto-mode doesn't adjust colors correctly (or the way you like).  There are settings for night, fireworks, foliage, kids&pets;, which I haven't tried yet but I look forward to tinkering with those as well.We are really enjoying this camera and are happy with the photo results and extra effects we've tried thus far.

Merems", "ReviewID": "R28SQUY4XVGFMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera because we needed to replace an old 1.3 meg camera.  I have purchased a Canon camera for my daughter and I was always pleased with the image quality.  A while back I saw the A700 and I was interested because my wife wanted a greater zoom range then the 3-4X and I wanted a viewfinder.  However I knew she wouldn't use a tripod or steady herself before taking shots so I decided to hold off buying it for a while.I was cruising the web recently and I noticed the A710IS.  After reading the reviews I was sold.  I received the camera and started taking sample shots (indoors and outdoors and movies.)  My wife took it to the kids swim meet (the final test) and we reviewed all the photos.All I can say is wow. The outdoor shots are clear even at full zoom.  The indoor shot are good but subject to lighting conditions.  The movies are great.The most interesting thing of all is how long the batteries are lasting.  I am still on my first set of batteries (Costco-Kirkland)and we have taken over 200 photos (medium, fine and superfine resolutions)and movies (6 min, 3 min, 2 min) over a few days.  I use the viewfinder and set the LCD display to only stay on for 3 seconds after each shot.  I don't typically review the photos in the camera.  Of the 200 shots at least 50 were taken using the flash.  So I don't understand some of the comments about poor battery life.A friend at work had just bought a Panasonic 7.1 meg IS 3X camera the same week I received my A710IS. He commented that he wasn't sure the camera was working well.  So the next day he and I walked during lunch stopping and taking photos (same resolution settings and trying to match the same zoom amount).  We even took movies while we were walking.  Later in the day we downloaded the photos and did a side by side comparison. Both camera took nice pictures but when you enlarged the photos and compared the images, hands down the Canon was superior.  My friend returned the Panasonic and now has the A710IS and his wife loves it.Go for it.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost there.", "Author": "J. Haber", "ReviewID": "R1RL0LIQZXP2ML", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.Pros:- Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge.- Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too.- Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed.- Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to....- Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.- Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even.- Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful.- Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the \"welcome\" image sound and screen.- Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch.- You can change lenses and add filters very easily.Cons:- As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for.- No \"action\" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually.- Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.- Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good.- The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful.- Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.- Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.

(although you can force flash in manual mode obviously)-semi-fragile (first one fell 3 inches onto a rock and broke)Upsides:-6x optical zoom (for a camera of this size thats amazing!)-Image stabilization (I love this- I am a believer, I can shoot 1/15 or even 1/10 and get clear photos about half of the time)-one-hand control (I backpack a lot, and usually have my hiking poles in the other hand, yet even on fully-manual mode, the all the controls can be done, with a little practice,  with the same hand that is holding the camera)-It takes AA's instead of proprietary battery (I am an outdoors man, and don't have access to a charger all the time)-The battery life is fantastic (Using 2700mAh batteries, I would get about 650 shots on a single set of 2 AA's.)-Very intuitive interfaces for a camera of this complexity. (I didn't read any manuals at all!)-Small (Fits easily in a pocket)-Good photos (No, not as nice as a SLR, but for the size of the lens it is in the top 10% quality wise)-Light weight (I am a backpacker. Its only 7.4  oz. I like that.)-Fast start-up time (It takes 1.7 seconds to go from hitting the power button to capturing a photo.

I bought the A710 a month and a half ago to replace the G1.  I am very happy with the A710 and here are some of my feedback about the A710:Strength:1. Excellent picture quality for a compact digital camera.  Pictures are sharp enough, exposure is mostly very good and color is good so long one has sufficient light (doesn't have to be ideal or great light).2. Very rich function set; lots of features and freedom of tailoring.3. Just about the right size.  Easy to use especially with its rich functions, much better than the tiny credit-card cameras.4  Optical viewfinder, Image Stalization and AA battery are HUGE plus.  No more extra lenses and I still can take pictures by looking directly at most of what I am shooting.5. Great zoom range.  28mm would've been better, though I am not complaining about what it is now.6. A terrific everyday camera and excellent back-up for SLR when quick set-up and shooting is needed.Weakness:There really isn't any.  In low-light the picture gets noisy like most compact digital camera do.  Some commented on the battery usage; I don't plan to take thousands of pictures with it every year, so I use Energizer lithiium AA battery, and battery is not a problem for me.It does need a camera case, otherwise one would have to take extreme caution not to damage the LCD panel.Overall, I am very happy with it, and I highly recommend the Canon A710.UPDATE - 03/14/2007:After using it for a while, the Canon A710 is beginning to grow on me.  It easily can do at least 90% of everyday phtography extremely well.  I still use DSLR for special occassions, but these are become fewer and fewer.I have not use any add-on flash so 'serious' flash photography can be less than ideal with the A710, although there are some room to tweak on the flash and exposure to make it less harsh.  The A710 is truly a great product from Canon, I would like to see how they can top this one.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point and Shoot", "Author": "B.

I am a novice, but have found the camera very easy to use.  I replaced my aging Fuji Finepix 2600, which was great for it's time, but I was looking for better picture quality, no more blurry pictures of my active 2 yr old, better flash, more features, etc. etc.I actually replaced the first A710IS I got from Amazon as it had red dots on the LCD screen.  After returning it and further research, I found that this was most likely dead pixels in the LCD itself.  The replacement that Amazon sent was perfect.Positives:-Excellent picture quality so far both indoors and outdoors-Awesome Zoom-VERY stable pictures at extended zoom ranges-Great \"quick\" buttons provide easy and quick access to camera features without navigating the menu-Menu system is VERY easy to use and intuitive-Large LCD - compared to my Fuji, the sceen is very large and works well in all lighting situations-Stitch Features: I tried the \"Stitch\" feature (which may be common on other cameras, but I've never heard of it until I read the owner's manual for this camera).  I tried it once and took 3 pictures to stitch together.  It was Very easy to figure out how to use on both the camera and the software that canon provides.  It worked Great to provide a panoramic shot.The only negatives I have found have already been mentioned by other reviewers (which is why I gave a 4 instead of a 5 rating):-Battery Drainage: Drains the batteries quickly. For me, this isn't a big deal as I always be sure to have extra batteries on hand.  I started out using my rechargeable batteries from my old Fuji, so since these are about 4 yr old, that could be part of the problem.  I plan on buying newer rechargeables and expect them to last even longer.-LCD:  1. LCD doesn't swivel: Again, not a big deal as I'm not sure how much usage I'd get out of this, but it would be nice for the few occasions that I may need it.  2. LCD Resolution seems a bit low such that the picture quality on the LCD appears a bit fuzzy.  The quality it good, but not great.-Included memory card - the 16MB memory card that is included is a joke.  I purchased a 1 GB Ultra II card, which should be plenty for my usage-Physical size of pictures is Large - This is obvious given the higher megapixel count for the camera (6 MP compared to my Fuji's 2 MP), so not really a negative, but more of a reality to be aware of if you have the settings at Fine and above.I still haven't tried the movie mode yet, but plan to soon.

Of course this is no SLR, so there is a limit to what you can do when playing with the depth of field and other artistic effects, also I would not recommend using anything above ISO 200 since the noise becomes quite visible at ISO 400, although, not really an issue until you add one more stop.I was able to use manual exposure mode to experiment with HDR, and I really liked the live exposure preview. It's a great feature for someone who wants to learn more about photography. Being able to see the effect of different exposure settings before actually taking the shot is just great.Another feature I was amazed with is the 60 fps video mode. The picture is very smooth and optical image stabilization helps a lot in video mode. Too bad Canon is still using the MJPEG format for video compression. Your video clips will be huge. Better stock up on some SDHC cards (thankfully, they are supported) and learn how to compress your videos to DivX when you transfer them to a PC.Battery life on NiMH rechargeables is great and you can't downplay the versatility of being able to put regular AA batteries in your camera. To be even happier, I bought some plastic cases on eBay to carry the spare batteries around, a very useful addition to the camera, indeed.The flash does take a few seconds to recharge, and the screen goes blank during that time, which is very annoying. But it looks like this is more of a \"feature\" intentionally implemented by Canon engineers (not really sure why, though). I found a work around. If you flick the mode selector to \"Preview\" immediately after taking a shot you will see the picture you've just taken, instantly, and if you flick the mode selector back to the picture taking mode you'll be able to take another picture a lot sooner than if you would've just waited for the flash to recharge and the blank screen to go away.The flash power is great, and..  ..manually adjustable. Also, the sensitivity is automatically boosted to ISO 400 when the flash is on, not necessarily a good thing. It helps making better pictures indoors, but adds some extra noise others have been complaining about. Thankfully, you can override this in the manual modes.The lens are crisp, at least compared to the other cameras in this class. And the longer zoom really comes handy when you need it.The main downside to this camera is the camera body itself. There is nothing to complain about the controls and how the camera sits in your hand when you are taking pictures, it feels very sturdy and just the right size. But I'm used to carry compact cameras in my jeans pocket, and this one just barely fits in there. Also, with a large part of the camera body made of metal, the places that will see the most wear in your pocket are all plastic. Another annoying thing is the battery compartment door. Every time you open it to get the SD card, the batteries are just waiting to pop out, and good luck putting them in. You'll have to remember the way they go in by hart, since the markings that tell you which way is + are deep inside the battery compartment and are impossible to read anywhere but in direct sun light.There where a few upsets trying to take a great picture quick. While scrambling to get the camera out of the pocket and trying to dial in the right mode and settings the subject was already gone. But I guess it is hard to blame this completely on the camera.All in all this is a very, very versatile camera. I can't think of anything like it for the price, or even outside of its price range. SLRs and ultra compacts come with their own set of issues and limitations. I'm even thinking of buying an underwater enclosure for the camera. And there are lens adapters and filters and other useful accessories available for a reasonable price. Also, with this being a Canon, nothing even comes close in terms of the quality of in-camera image processing and accuracy of automatic exposure.For someone who wants to learn more about photography but doesn't want to spend at least twice as much for an entry level SLR (and end up without a point-and-shoot camera) this is the best camera out there. Think of it as a G or an S series Canon for the masses.

Anything else would be a compromise.In the meantime the family needs a small camera. Bought an Olympus mju 725.

Well, I bought this one, took a few sample shots...and now I use it more than my family!The quality of image is excellent in all situations, normally at the auto setting. Manual overide lets me play to my heart's content, but to be honest the auto is very good.Video clips are very decent at 30fps, albeit occupy a lot of space as a consequence of the quality.Flash re-charge can take a few seconds so consecutive flash photos are not too feasible, although consecutive photos in normal light are not problem at all, I think 2.5 fps. Excellent for sports and action.The piece de resistance is the 6x zoom lens with optical stabiliser, it really works excellently for those zoom shots for sports. Close ups using macro are excellent, down to just a very few short centimetres, amazing.While this camera is fairly small, it is not one of those class of really compact. However they do not have the same quality of this one or are really awkward to use.This one is a great balance of size, cost, functions and great quality.

AVAILABLE LIGHT PHOTOS are now doable because (a) \"film\" speed is upfrom ASA 100 or 200 to ASA 800 (some SLRs reach 1600, but now we'reclose) (b) shutter speed: if you could hand-hold steady enough at 1/30thsec before, with image stabilization you can do 1/5th sec easily.  Thisis the first A-series camera with image stabilization, and Canon doesnot \"cheat\" by running an image processing algorithm on an alreadyruined image.  Instead, they move a lens element floating on tiny ceramicbearings with a piezoelectric (??) transducer to prevent the image fromsmearing across the CCD sensor in the first place.  I agree with Canonthat I.S. technology is good for up to 3 f/stops, 2 for sure.2.  GREAT ZOOM, SAME f/2.8  We note with tears and regret that Canon isstill handing out f/2.8 lenses that drop to f/4 or worse when zoomed fromwide to tele.  C'mon guys, this is the company that holds the worldrecord for fastest commercial camera lens, f/0.95, the company that beatNikon's f/1.2.  I go with Canon for the sharp and undistorted optics, Ilove the zoom range, doubled from everybody's 3x optical to 6x here(5.8mm-34.8mm, or 35-210mm 35mm equivalent), and now I can use the long210mm-equivalent tele because image stabilization acts like bumping upthe shutter speed 2 or 3 notches.3. MACRO MAGNIFIED.  The macro range has always been great on theseA-series Canon (here, from 0.4\"), but impossible to use unless you carried a bigmagnifying glass to figure out if the screen looked focused or not.  Nomore -- the magnifier is built in.  A large rectangle in the middle ofthe screen shows a magnified image as you shift the focus!  (Press theFLOWER/MF button once for MACROMODE, the press it again forMANUALFOCUS.) When you press the shutter button partway down, the magrectangle disappears leaving an uncluttered view for image composition.Now you don't have to try your old tricks of putting a spare plus lensfrom Grandma's glasses in front of the camera so that it can focuscloser.  If you do, you should turn off image stabilization, because thealgorithm's assumptions about camera lens focal length have beeninvalidated.  So how do Canon's official WIDE, TELE and MACRO clip-onlenses work?  Just fine.  But now you have to go deep into the menu tree(MENU / CAMERA / CONVERTER / WHICH? ) and tell the camera which one isclipped on.4. REVIEW of past shots is fast, and the modern \"ring button\" controlsmake mousing around on magnified shots much faster and more intuitive.5. KEY SPECS, PARTING SHOTS:Seven Megapixels (3072 x 2304)6x zoom: 5.8mm-34.8mm (35-210mm 35mm equivalent)  f/2.8 drops to f/4.8 at tele2.5\" LCD screen, optical viewfinderManual Focus: has excellent magnified screen for macroMacro Focus Range: 0.39 - 21.6 in.Aperture priority exposure gives you one-button control of how much to  open the lens vs whether to push shutter speed up or down,  without having to set everything or lose autofocus.Custom white balance is a snap to use -- press FUNCTION, jog down one  step to the custom white balance icon, and press MENU to make  something that **is** white or neutral gray **look** white or  neutral on the display.  If you don't have mixed indoor/outdoor  light or open sky illumination or strange fluorescents, AUTO  WHITE BAL is fine.Sensitivity: Auto, Hi ISO Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, & 800 ISO  Unfortunately, AUTO is very conservative and you can't get  those available light shots you want; leaving the camera set on  800 will ruin shots with sensor noise when you don't have to,  and HIGHSPEED ISO AUTO, which would be ideal, is not available  in key shooting modes.  You have to get out of any mode that  gives you any exposure control and use either AUTO (the camera  does everything for you and doesn't tell you what it did--the  Republican mode) or PROGRAM, which is the same, but the aperture  and exposure that you still can't do anything about are shown  cheerfully on the screen (Democratic mode).2 AA batteries, and they last longer than my old Canon with twice the  power (4 batts) and a smaller screen.

She doesn't want to know anything about apertures or ISO settings, she just wants to shoot and play with the cool features like color swapping and such.  My wife absolutely loves it.  She sat for hours just playing with the features in our living room.  It takes beautiful, noise-free pictures and is easy to use.  When she finally put it down for a minute (got to go to the bathroom sometime) I took a few test shots with it.  I have to say, I'm quite impressed.  The image stabilization alone is worth the upgrade from our older Fuji F700.  I was able to take a crystal-clear picture of our sleeping dog, in a dimly-lit room, using no flash and a 1.5 second exposure time by just hand-holding the camera and bracing my elbows on a table.  I would never dream of trying a hand-held shot with my film camera for that long.I was worried about the size of this camera when I bought it for her.  She usually keeps the digital camera in her pants pocket when we go out, while I lug around a camera bag and tripod everywhere.  This camera looked bulky on the web, but it's actually lighter than our old Fuji F700, and still fits easily into her pants pocket.  Also, the shape of the camera makes it very easy to hold.  I'm always more interested in features which allow me to take a good picture, rather than those which provide convenience.  With the A710, you get a camera which is small and light enough to carry easily, plus a shape which allows for a firm, steady grip, even if you are using only one hand.There is one area where a compromise was necessary.  Canon designed the A710 to use two AA batteries, whereas the other \"A\" series cameras use four.  This allowed them to make the camera lighter and smaller, and careful power management still lets you get lots of pictures from NiMh re-chargable batteries.  The only downside is flash recharge time.  Even with new batteries, flash recharge time is about 5 seconds.  I'm willing to put up with that to get a camera my wife can carry anywhere, and that uses AA batteries that can be bought anywhere.

There are a couple of attachments that Canon and other makers have available for it but I think that if one needs them you are better off buying a larger camera like a DSLR (The Nikon D40 is only about twice the price of the 710is) instead of attaching different lenses to it and making it fragile and bulky.I just love it!", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "A710 IS Compared To Digital Rebel EOS and SD600", "Author": "DP \"Des\"", "ReviewID": "RZX37A50RW8X1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the years I've found the product reviews here on Amazon to be invaluable and now I am returning the favor with a brief review of my own. In the Fall of 2003 I bought my first digital camera, the Canon Digital Rebel EOS. That camera continues to serve my wife and I well and was enough to make me a believer in Canon's digital camera products. Neither my wife or I are serious camera buffs and thus neither of us have ever come close to utilizing all the Digital Rebel's features or abilities. Don't get me wrong, we love the pictures it takes and there's nothing like traveling with our laptop and sharing our daily adventures with friends and family via e-mail. Unlike me however, my wife has never felt comfortable using the Digital Rebel and due to it's bulk and complexity she is unwilling to carry it with her when she and her friends get together.So, for her birthday in the Fall of 2006 I bought her a Canon PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph. The picture quality of the SD600 is outstanding. Although I did not buy the SD600 because of it's video recording ability, I am amazed at how well this feature works. Great for simple low-res video (including sound) of friends/family and pets etc. Yes I would say the SD600 is another high-quality, feature-packed Canon digital camera. However. It was our experience with the SD600 that one does not simply start using it \"out of the box\". The SD600 has a serious learning curve. Our camera included two rather imposing users manuals, one of which wasthe \"Quick Start Guide\". This has diminished my wife's enthusiasm of the SD600 significantly.Enter the PowerShot A710 IS. My seventy year old mother visited us thismonth (May 2007). With her she brought my folks new Canon PowerShot A710 IS. My wife and I both tried it and we were both delighted. It's larger than the SD600 but only slightly. It has the rounded grip like that found on the Digital Rebel which gives it a really solid yet comfortable feel. We found it's control layout to be comfortable. My wife and motherpreferred to use the LCD when taking pictures whereas I preferred the optical view finder. It's nice to have a choice.

The mechanics seem sound and I have recently purchased the additional lens converter and tele lens, which performs very well. Even with out the tele lens, the optical zoom of x6 is more than the majority in this range.The 7.1 MP is also ample for most amateur photographers - with Superfine res set on the camera, at this level there is no drop in resolution quality for a 16x20\" print. And let's face it, how often do most people actually get photos printed in this size?One slight chink is the red-eye which does not always work well in dim light conditions. Having used previous digital camera brands that claimed the same, none have really met expectations; so I would say this Canon is no worse than others. Furthermore, Canon must have realized this as the supplied image software is very easy to use and has a noticeable button to remove red-eye, which it does very well.Yes, normal AA batteries are used up after approximately 200 shots. However, I was recently advised by a camera expert to use Energizer Lithium E2 (L91BP) batteries and the ones I am using have been going for 423 shots without replacement needed yet (including flash many times), so this is now not a problem for me.If you are not a SLR purist, and want high specs and functionality as well as flexibiility, then in my opinion there is not other camera at present in this price range that matches these criteria this well.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sent back to Amazon", "Author": "Patricia F.

I used it many years ago.  It took great pictures but was a hastle.  Each shot took a while to set up.  Using the long, heavy, telephoto required a tripod to hold it still.  It required a minor piece of luggage to lug around.  Since then, I have used a few digital cameras.This camera is by far the best I ever used.  The image stabilization feature works like magic.  At 6x you point and shoot and it takes beautiful pictures.  Even the digital magnification feature works reasonably well.I bought it for a trip to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.  I took over 200 pictures before I had to change batteries.  The 1 gig card I bought with the camera can hold over 400 pictures of the density I was taking.  My pictures came out excellent, except for the grizzly who was running about 400yds away; she was blurry.  Almost every other picture came out perfect.  I am having about 8 printed at 8x10 and one at 20x30.I watched many photographers in Yellowstone with large lenses and tripods.  For amature purposes, I suspect that I got better pictures with this camera with its image stabilization than they got with their much more expensive cameras, lenses, and tripods.  It was amazing.I also took a few videos.  It turns out that I am not Steven Spielberg, but the camera did its part.The camera has simple controls, not too many buttons, and a nice clear screen.  It is hard to see the screen in full sunlight though, but that is a common problem with these cameras.Amazon lists it for $509 but I paid about $269 for the camera (and $17 for the 1 gig memory card) from Ace Photo Digital, through Amazon, about a month ago.  They shipped promptly - no problem.I also bought the underwater housing for scuba diving.  I had an underwater housing for another digital camera and couldn't use the camera underwater because there were too many buttons and I couldn't really see the screen.

I got the A710 because it is pocketable (I will probably get a larger camera in the future, either something like the S3 IS or an SLR).  The 6x zoom and image stabilisation are great features.I like that it takes AA batteries which can be purchased anywhere.  Several reviewers have complained about battery life and I had the same experience with regular batteries.  But, I have found that with the newer lithium ion (non rechargeable)high power batteries the battery life is excellent. I was able to take over 3GB worth of photos (about 800) on one set and this included flash and lots of review and editing.  For a 2 week trip (1200 plus photos) you only need one spare set of AA batteries. These batteries are light weight also.Photo quality is good but the camera does overexpose if the the exposure compensation is not used (resulting in burned out highlights).  I find I allways need to underexpose by 1/3 to a full f stop.  This is annoying and those not familiar with photography may find it difficult to get good results in many situations. It also increases the chance of having to spend time \"photoshopping\" the end result.The LCD display is poor, The resolution is such that it is difficult to tell if photos are in focus. The LCD is also quite sensitive to angle of view and has to be tilted slightly for best results (I checked this on another model and it was the same). As with most cameras the LCD is almost useless in full day light. Unfortunately as many have pointed out this is confounded by the fact that the optical viewfinder does not show the full picture capture area. I don't like electronic view finders much but at least you can see them in day light and have access to all the menu information.I do like the video option although the resolution leaves a lot to be desired (and you cannot operate the zoom while taking a video).Again as others have pointed out the recycle time after using flash is quite long.I am intrigued by the availability of add-on lenses and filters although you will lose the pocketability if you use these (or have to fit and remove them after each photo).  The (0.8) \"wide\" angle lens is still not very wide (this allways seems to be a problem for digital cameras). They are also expensive if you use the (probably higher quality) canon models.  The macro mode of this camera works very well.Overall this is a good fairly easy to use camera which has features that few other cameras in its size and price range can match.

They unbeatable features that I could not find anywhere else.About this camera, the pictures are really sharp, and the IS works real fine, I'll attach some pics to show the IS effect.battery life, is not bad, although I regret upgrading from A610 which was a better performer with batteries, due to having 4 instead of 2 batt, which also contributes a great deal to the flash recharging time. And by the way, I took really great and sharp pics with the A610 even though it has no IS, so I thought that IS doesn't mean much to me. This is the most frustrating issue with this camera. You turn it on just to catch a moment with your kid, for instance, it jsut kills it by having to wait for 6-8 secs for that extremely slow flash to charge. not to mention after taking a photo, the LCD goes completely black, you see nothing on the screen, why? because, again, the flash is recharging. so frustrating.But honestly, other than that everything works well in this cameara. Thus if you are using it mainly outdoors, you will not face this problem that much, in fact, outdoor pics are stunning.Lastly, I wish canon people can read this, which I believe many canon users will share the following complains/wishes with me.(1) why cann't we have a battery check appears on the camera screen, instead of the \"Surprise, I'm dying\" signal you get when the battery is about to die? I don't think it is impossible for canon to do that, while in fact all of the panasonic and probably sony cameras do have this feature.(2) For God sake, why cannot we have the date imprint feature to be optional with all resolutions, instead if being ONLY restricted to the 1600x1200 (2MP) mode? again, it just doesn't make sense to me.(3) why cannot canon have a separate playback soft-touch botton (like the one in the SD750 and G7), NOT a switch which takes few seconds to change from the playback to the record mode. Again, Panasonic and Sony do have a soft botton for play back in all of their cameras, so if you are play or reviewing the recorded photos, and suddenly you need to take the picture, all you have to do is to softly press the shutter release botton, and it switches itself to the record mode, it is that simple, just like with the big SLR cameras.

It would sometimes take 3-5 seconds before the next picture could be taken. It was only after I purchased the camera that I discovered that the A710 is well-known for this problem. However, the problem has been solved. Here's the changes I made:1) Used high-quality rechargeable batteries. (Be careful of the rechargeable batteries as they lose charge just sitting around. Choose the pre-charged type.)2) Set the camera on AV mode.3) Purchased the Transcent SDHC Class 6 8gb SD card offered here on Amazon.com. I just received the card in the mail today, so I immediately put it into the camera and tried it out.The results were AWESOME. The flash recharge problem disappeared.

Initially, I was set on acquiring a Panasonic Lumix, but after doing more research and reading all the favorable comments submitted by the commercial photographer as well as the private user regarding the A710 IS, I decided that the Canon would be the better choice for me. Having owned the camera for four months now, I have yet to regret my decision.Looking closely, the camera shows good construction, with great fit and finish. In usage, I don't believe the A710 can truly be considered a \"pocket camera\", but I find the shape and heft to be more reassuring than a drawback. I don't mean to imply that the Canon is bulky, for it is certainly compact enough, even for the user with small hands. But neither can it be carried comfortably or safely inside a shirt or pants pocket - a belt bag or purse would serve better.The many functions and menu items the Canon utilizes should cover just about any photo opportunity you are presented with, and while changing settings and adjusting scene modes is somewhat intuitive, it would be to your advantage to read the owner's guide in order to fully understand and make better use of all the capabilities the A710 offers. I spent an hour having good fun toying with all the controls and scrolling through the menus, which partly explains why the batteries ran out of juice so quickly when I actually started to snap pictures at the high resolution settings.As for Canon's picture quality, I am more than satisfied. The images displayed on my 17\" iMac after downloading (you can use the included software or your own computer's native photo application) contain true-to-life colors and above average detail. I did find the occasional indoor flash shot to be slightly on the \"warm\" side, but easily corrected to my taste by some digital tweaking. Though I have yet to make prints of any of my images, I am more than confident that quality prints can be achieved all the way up to an 8 X 10.In closing, I think Canon has produced a digicam for the public majority. I have found the A710 IS to be all the camera I need, not just for now, but probably for a long time to come.

It's small and easy to tote around.  It's also loaded with neat features like IS, a 6x zoom, view finder, as well as different scene modes.  These modes are for night, sporting, and landscape settings as needed.  It makes life a little easier for point and shoot photographers.  In addition you can play around with various color settings and really take artistic pictures.  It also has full manual mode which is a truly great feature to have on any camera.  The canon software is also decent.  The photostich app is a handy way of doing panoramics without using a photoshop type program.On the downside canon only gives you a 16mb SD card which can only hold about 4 high resolution shots.  Considering that prices are dropping on these cards it's almost an insult.  But that's not so much a criticism of the camera.  My only real gripe with the camera itself is that the flash recycles painfully slow.  I had read that this was true and thought this might be an exaggeration.  It is not.  The good news is that this camera takes extremely good low light photos so if you've got decent indoor lighting you can take nice interior shots without really needing the flash in the first place.While image quality is very good I was a little disappointed.  I have an old canon S30 3.2 mp and I did some comparisons.  While the 710 did shoot noticeably higher resolution it didn't blow me away with clarity compared to 3.2 mp.  I thought the difference would be more dramatic then it actually is.  My old S30 was a very high quality camera and there is a lot to be said for optics.  But the 710 is a very good camera.  Considering that you can get it now for well under $300 it's really a bargain for a camera to does so much so well.If the flash rate was better I would easily give it 5 stars.

This camera is a camera that is small enough to take anywhere but still is big enough not to get lost in your hand.  It is easy to use right out of the box but has enough features to keep you trying different things and experimenting for weeks.  The picture quality is great.  Just one slight negative is the tiny capacity memory stick that comes with it.  If you buy this camera order a larger stick as well.  (Example: the stick that comes with the camera will only hold 3-4 pictures)Second about Amazon.  When I ordered this camera there was a promotional item that should have come with the item.  The Amazon website for some reason did not allow me to order the promo item.  I emailed customer support and they had the issue solved within 48 hours.  I received the promo item and as a bonus Amazon absorbed the shipping cost of the promo item.  I have been using Amazon for quite a few years now and all the purchases I have made have been good experiences.

Freel", "ReviewID": "R3QJWO3Q257M40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: I was either extremely lucky that day or really steady and fired off a 1 second exposure holding the camera against my chest.  It was an inside shot, no flash, of my wife in the kitchen fixing breakfast. She was noticeable only as a blur moving around in the kitchen.  I zoomed in to the items on the counter at pixel level on my monitor and could not tell any camera movement.  Very outstanding.  Oh yes, the IS was on.Cons:  The picture quality leaves me a little cold however.  The details get muddied up a little in the high contrast small detail. I think my Fuji 330 Finepix did a better job at it.  It was a 3 Mpix and possibly had a better match with the lens and sensor. The detail at pixel level was better. IMHO more MPix alone may not necessarily be a better picture only larger image files on my hard drive.  Possibly a less aggressive JPeg compression would help also and I wish a lot of these cameras had more compression options to back off a little.  With the price of big memory cards going down fast, I would think that less compression would soon be in order.  Have not had the camera long enough to comment on battery life.Overall:An excellent buy with a lot of features including manual settings capabilities, and of course the amazing IS.Update: On a trip recently to Guadalajara Mexico I'm still impressed with the IS operation of this camera.  Many of the buildings are illuminated at night and make interesting images.  I had excellent results and all images were very acceptable.Update #2 November 2007  We were in a rainy Europe for three weeks with this as my backup/pocket camera.  It continued as my low light camera with the IS feature.  I couldn't always have my Canon 30D with me, and this camera worked flawlessly set to Program mode for most of the trip.  One issue I did notice was with an f2.8 lens opening, high contrast areas get muddied up in the fine detail.

I was a VERY hard sell.  I already had my 35mm, and I wanted no parts of a $200+ camera whose pictures I could only see on a computer.  What a rip off!Then I went to a very famous landmark, and discovered it was too dark to see its stunning features in the photos that came back.  I still wasn't a willing adapter, but I was willing to consider maybe a digital camera could have been helpful here.So after going through tons of camera reviews, I took the plunge and bought this Canon A710 in mid March 2007.  This is still one of my best purchases.  I still don't think it would have made those pictures on that particular trip come out better, but for everything else:  Excellent.  Plus, that whole computer business turned out to be a benefit: I no longer have to worry about where to store all those glossy little prints, as much as I like being able to touch them physically.  I can also print them out several times if necessary.  Plus mailing paper is a whole lot easier than mailing photos.  And for all those graphic text editing programs that lets you add your own pictures and colors, a digital camera is the perfect complement to create wonderful designs.  I easily used my pictures from the digital camera as a screensaver on my computer, and even had a guy who takes pictures as a side business ask me what (high priced) equipment I used to get such great results.  Just this Canon A710.  (now I really DO sound like ad; and no I'm not being paid!)  And if things couldn't get better, the software automatically loaded my pictures by date in my chosen folder.  NICE!Unfortunately, all good things on this earth must end.  In November 2010, my camera started having minor problems (something caused the shutter not to close completely, disk temporarily claimed no pictures were on it, pictures temporarily wouldn't load correctly to the computer, slight degradation of picture quality, etc)  I know that digital items tend to fail more catastrophically than analog, and with less warning time, so I very reluctantly started looking for a replacement.  Fortunately, the camera was still taking very good pictures, so I still had a good deal of time before the replacement became a necessity.Unfortunately, I broke the cardinal rule of non-weather/water-proof digital cameras:  DON'T USE IN RAIN.  After that incident, the bottom left side of all the rest of my pictures blurred.  Fortunately by then, I had found a new camera.  However, by now, any new camera will always be compared to the features of this A710 Canon.  The NEW camera requires special batteries, instead of the AA's the canon took.  The NEW camera is all touchscreen, while canon had manual dials (don't think this is a problem, try to select an option with sweaty or dirty fingers).  The NEW camera doesn't have a separate view finder like the canon did.  The NEW camera only zooms 8X, instead of the digital 24X that the canon did.  The NEW camera's PC software doesn't organize by date like the canon did.  The NEW camera's pictures don't image as well as the canon does.  yada, yada, yada.So we're clear:  the NEW camera is NOT a canon; I'll live.  But sometimes you don't really appreciate what you have until it's gone.  Yes it had faults, like the lag time between consecutive pictures could be up to 10 seconds.  Or in misty conditions, the camera focuses on the water droplets in the air instead of the scene.  Or that it cost ~$250 while the NEW camera was only ~$145 with upgraded features.  But that being said, it was a REALLY good camera, and served me well for almost 5 years.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Long time user", "Author": "George C.

Recently its zooming has started to jerk alarmingly (probably because I've dropped it a few times), so I am trying to find a \"next generation\" replacement that preserves all the good features, and disappointed that no such thing exists.I photograph butterflies and other small critters with the A710, using the optional close-up and lens adapter accessories.  The results are really, really good.  The focus distance of about 7-8 inches using the powerful Canon 250D optional close-up lens is perfect (many butterflies will let you get that close if you don't cast your shadow on them).  When I travel I just bring along a dozen rechargeable AA batteries.  This camera is a dream.  I can't believe Canon no longer produces anything like it.There are no cameras anymore that use 2xAA.  The superzooms now all use 4xAA, and they are not pocketable, because they are battling each other for zoom length, so even when the lens is closed these cameras are big.None of the pocketable compacts (\"ultracompacts\") offer lens accessories now!  None!  I have spent weeks searching.  I will probably try to make my own with velcro or something.Currently I am considering replacing with a Panasonic DMC-ZS7.  This means buying (ugh) several $30 proprietary batteries for travel.  On the plus side, the compacts are getting smaller, zooms are getting longer, and I look forward to the \"tracking AF\" feature because my biggest problem is when insects won't hold still.  But, it is depressing how little image quality has improved.  The ZS7 actually takes worse photos than its predecessor the ZS3 in low light conditions (so I have read).  I assumed they would have improved the sensors every year.If you want a pocketable camera with cheap batteries that can take close-up and other filters (once you buy the adapter), the A710 is a classic.  The only significant downside is it takes forever to cycle when using flash, so if you need to use flash more than once in quick succession, I would not recommend it (it would be fine for people posing though.  But not fine for, say, trying to photograph an elusive animal with flash).", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy", "Author": "C.

I use the camera for low light club photography - rarely if ever use the flash.  Initially I  thought the camera was a battery hog but after replacing the Sony NiMH batteries that I purchased with the camera, my battery life problems ended.  If you are not comfortable with terms like ISO, shutter speed, aperture , etc just put the camera in AUTO mode and point and shoot - the camera will do the thinking for you.  If you are comfortable  with classic manual photography just about everything is adjustable.  With the builtin  image stabilization, and 35-210mm equiv lens and manual mode there is little you can't do successfully with this camera. Except under the worst lighting condition, there is virturally no shutter lag.Cons:  The builtin lens cover blades stuck in the open position.  Also, if you are using manual mode and the camera goes into sleep mode due to inactivity and then you press the shutter it will wake up and take the photo BUT some of the manual settings you setup are reverted to defaults - this is a real PITA when you are using manual focus and waiting for a shot that you have prefocused only to have the camera discard your prefocus when the anticipated action finally occurs and you press the shutter.  As with any digital camera the top ISO speed (ASA 800 for the A710) is noisy.Suggestions:  Buy at least a 2gb flash card - the included 16mb card is too small to be useful.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Glo E.

Pocketable means pocketable: 1) the need for an add-on flash because the built-in one is only good for 11 feet instead of 18 feet. 2) the need for a case because the LCD doesn't reverse for storage like others in the Canon product line.

I forget why.. maybe to minimize noise as I hate using flash?  Probably.Oh, and something where I could play with the ISO, especially for indoors.  Goes up to 800, and goes down to 80.  Love using 80 when it's a sunny day.. you get really good colors.  And as I hate the way flash turns out on cameras in general, it's nice to have an 800 option.Also, I love the toy features of Color Accent, coupled with the Manual, TV, and AV, Program, and Auto feature.. as well as the others but I don't use those as much.  It's a good combination to have.  People aren't lost when they use my camera, but I also have enough flexibility if I want to.The Macro also lets you get a lot closer I think than the other digital cameras that are smaller with smaller lenses such as the SD line (which also seemed to have some LCD problems at the time.. not sure if those are resolved) , which I'm guessing is what people are choosing between.Yet, it fits in my jacket pocket if I need it to and not to mention, fits my hand nicely.. not like those very clean rectangular digital cameras that you're always afraid of dropping.I bought this camera for my brother as well after I got mine, as he liked my camera so much he kept using it.You should use rechargeable AA batteries with this, and the AA size is really convenient also because sometimes you're traveling and you're lazy to bring your charger so you can just buy AA batteries wherever or borrow from someone else.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "canon A710", "Author": "Joseph H.

Used camera for family shots, landscape shots, some digiscoping of birds and macro shots for insects, amphibians and plants.  Movie with sound is cool feature.  HD CCD would be a plus.  And it works great in most lighting situations.  In dim landscape situations with strong back-lighting the back ground gets washed out unless you click on the sky and then drag to the subject.  Then the for-ground is under exposed, but at least you can lighten in Picasa or similar.  Other minor complaints are it's not water-proof/dust proof, it's has some shutter lag (0.3 sec), boot up time is fairly short (3sec with flash about 1 sec in bright conditions) and reboot time after a flash is long (approx 5 sec).  Sometimes the sutter lag is huge 2-3 seconds indoors using flash.  But haven't figured out why yet.Software is OK lacks sofisticated (sorry) renaming feature and sadly does not name files with date-time stamp.  Date-time is in exif data and can be added with Exifer.  I use Lupus rename to add essential data to file name such as who what where.  Would be nice if camera had a GPS to where stamp but that is asking a lot.When digiscoping paired with a Swarovski STS 65 with 20x eyepiece.  There is no vinetting.

Several of the reviews I read before buying this camera focused on not being able to find a suitable case.  The case I finally settled on is the LowePro Z5.  The camera, along with its wrist strap, slides into the case very easily and is fastened with a zipper.  It has a pocket on the front that fastens with Velcro and is easily big enough to accommodate two extra batteries, an extra SD card (in its cover) and maybe a few more small items.  It has a belt loop rather than a slip-on clip (this is not an issue for me).  The case has a small amount of padding that should protect the camera from minor bumps, but I doubt that it would protect it from a serious fall.Cons:  1). The case is just a fraction long for the camera.  If this becomes a problem, a small amount of tissue paper in the bottom should remedy that.  2). The closure flap for the storage pouch is attached about half an inch above the top of the pouch.  It is conceivable that a battery could slip through this gap.  By placing the batteries crosswise in the bottom of the pouch and the SD case above them and fastening the flap snuggly, I don't believe this will be an issue.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great small digital ....", "Author": "Don Chatwin", "ReviewID": "RT43KBI72UFFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "might not buy the $1200 dollar Nikon after this one.", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "My shopping experience with Amazon", "Author": "Weihua Li", "ReviewID": "R353MHS7LDYJ3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I am happy with the purchased camera.

Great set of features with aperture and shutter priority, full manual, 6X optical zoom, 7 MP, and image stabilization.  There just isn't another camera out there with the same features.  Feels good in the hand too.  I'm particularly impressed with the speed of operation, especially when using a high-speed SD card, and with the image stabilization feature.  I've been able to take good quality shots without a tripod at the 6X optical zoom setting and the shutter speed as slow as 1/30 of a second.  That would be impossible without stabilization.
