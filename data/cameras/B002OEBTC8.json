{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent entry level DSLR", "Author": "J. Kim \"James\"", "ReviewID": "R395F26T9I8N84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera last Friday. I had 2 full days to take great shots with this camera. I purchased two bundle kit, which comes with 18-55mm lens as well as 50-200mm lens. I have another manual focus lens, which is A50.7.One of the most asked questions about this camera is AF speed. Yes, AF is pretty quick. To test AF speed, I sometimes turn focus ring to opposite direction and checked the time it takes to set the focus. It was usually less than 0.4s. Even in low light situation, it worked fine. I took many shots with only one small table light in the living room so, ISO was 6400 and shutter speed was 1/4. Camera doesn't seem to have any problem for AF. Nice thing as a entry level camera is that it supports up to 11 AF point and you can choose your AF point. Some may say, it lacks super impose. However, simply touching 'ok' button reveals current AF point in the LCD screen. So, that's not a problem. AF is sharp and accurate. In MF mode, camera indicates the right focus in two ways both sound and indicator. So, there's no problem using manual focus lens. in Liveview mode, Camera magnifies focus point to assist you, which is very useful since viewfinder is very small.High ISO support. This is the best part I like about this camera. It supports up to 6400, and can be expanded to 12800. I took several shots outside around 6:00 PM. My friends used flash but my K-x didn't require flash. with 3200 or 6400 ISO, it still gave me clean bright pictures. Pentax did a great job reducing noise, especially color noise. It's hard to find the noise from the pictures. Now, 3200 is something you can use everyday. Actually, scene mode for the kids uses very high ISO to get 1/1000s or faster shutter speed. Thanks to that, pictures for my kids are all sharp and crispy.User interface is very intuitive and simple. Since this camera is small, most of the buttons are within reach of your thumb and index fingers. Though it's small, grip is ergonomically designed so that camera is very stable in your hand. It has one auxiliary button (green button), which you can assign other functions. It has drive mode, ISO, White balance, aperture and flash buttons. It also has dial to navigate menu faster.It uses 4 AA batteries and this is really nice. You can use your Ni-MH batteries or Lithium-ION batteries. It your camera is run out of juice, you can go nearby stores and buy one quickly. I took about 250 shots and I didn't need to recharge yet. Camera recognizes battery type automatically and optimizes the operation.with all the bells and whistles, I think Pentax K-x is super buy for the beginners. Not only it has all the features needed, it outperforms higher grade DSLRs in certain area like low noise. Thanks to great compatibility for the mount, even 30 years old lens can be used for this fresh new DSLR. It was quite fun to look at postings to sell old, student film camera kit at bargain price and you can use lens out of it. I also got 50mm fast lens which is excellent to take portrait shot from used market.A few updates.1. Some folks reported battery compatibility issue. Below is the blog of Pentax USA President. He recommended user to put batteries and wait for a few seconds so that Camera recognizes the type of batteries.[...]2. It also reveals a few problems related to Shake reduction. First, it produces noise from magnet handling CMOS censor. Bad thing is, this noise is recorded in movie mode. K-7 also has same issue but it supports external microphone. K-x doesn't allow that so, this can be one issue.3. It also shows color overflow problem under low light situation, especially red and blue. When there's bright light, for example traffic signal, red color or blue color spread around as if it overflows.A few users reported above problems to Pentax R&D; and they are supposed to return by 11/9. I hope firmware upgrade will fix those problems.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Little Wonder", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R1OLYR6NW12DBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax Kx is Pentax digital SLR for beginner and enthusiast. Pentax Kx replaces Pentax KM / K2000. There are many improvements from KM, such as three stops higher ISO setting, video recording, faster continuous shooting, 11 selectable auto focus points and 12.3 megapixel image resolution (compare to 10 mp). Kx shares same body as Km, so it is still very compact but not weather-sealed like Pentax k200, k20d or k7. It also use four AA batteries instead of lithium batteries.BODY & HANDLINGPentax Kx weights 581g, and its dimension is 122 x 92 x 69 mm. It is one of the smallest DSLR camera around, but not the lightest because of body material and 4X AA batteries.Using batteries has been always been debated, some people  like to have lithium battery with their camera, especially those who does not or concern about reliability of rechargeable batteries. Some might prefer the universal AA batteries because they are available everywhere and the rechargeable one is relatively cheaper compare to lithium one.Built quality of this camera is generally good for beginner digital SLR, sturdy and substantial. Ergonomic is not the best especially for people that has big hand or finger, but it is good in general.Like KM, the camera interface has been simplified yet very accessible. It has one thumb dial which you will use this a lot to change setting values. There are dedicated trash button, AF/AE-L, exposure compensation button, customizabe green button, live view button, info button, four way buttons which are shared with ISO, WB, Flash, self timer. These are basically what you will need and expect from a good digital SLR camera.There is also a shooting mode dial, where you can find manual and semi automatic control. There are also some popular scenes mode and video mode. Unique to Pentax, there is Sv (sensitivity mode), which allow you to set preferred ISO and let the camera decide on aperture and shutter speed value.Changing setting is fast and easy because of availability of many dedicated buttons. Main LCD screen could be activated by turning the camera to ON position or pressing INFO button. Pressing INFO button twice, you will get 12 squares representing popular settings such as auto HDR, image size, shake reduction, etc.This small control panel is a great help and better than Nikon's info screen, but it is not better than Olympus super control panel.LCD SCREEN & VIEWFINDERLCD screen is basic, plain 2.7\" , 230k. Compared to recent years DSLR, this screen is a bit outdated but it is not bad. Viewfinder is relatively big compare to beginner DSLR camera. Only Canon 500d and 450D can match the size of the viewfinder.AUTO FOCUS PERFORMANCEAuto focus (used with 18-55 kit lens) is surprisingly fast in bright light or low light situation. You will get AF confirmation in the viewfinder (hexagonal green dot) but there is no indicator where the active focus point is. For who that rely on automatic 5 points, 11 points or central point AF, it might not be a problem, but for those who usually use other individual AF point, it might be a bit of inconvenience.IMAGE QUALITY AND ISOPentax Kx  images in natural setting are not bright and saturated like competitor like Canon DSLR, but they are more muted and a bit cold. It is similar to Nikon DSLR such as Nikon D90. Nikon and Pentax Kx uses Sony sensor, and that might explain the similarity.But don't too worry if you don't like muted color, because you can always set higher saturation in Pentax custom setting or deal with it later in your favorite photo editing program. But off course it won't match Canon color when you both set the saturation setting to the max.The sensor strength is on high ISO setting. It matches Nikon D90 and even slightly better. Combined with built in shake reduction, this camera is very good in low light photography such as night scene or indoor performance. This performance might be the best for crop sensor camera up to date and only to be beaten by expensive full frame camera such as Nikon D700 12.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) or Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)OTHER FACTS & FINDINGS  * Pentax Kx is available in 100 colors combination in Japan  * Built-in photo processing like auto HDR is slow (takes approx. 10 sec to process and to make a good HDR, you need tripod). It also drain batteries power quickly. Live view, movie recording is very basic for DSLR standard and it also drain batteries. Prepare plenty of rechargeable AA batteries if you keen on using these features.  * The kit lens 18-55mm is generally an OK kit lens, but to get better image quality especially sharpness and image acuity, I recommend you to look for some better lenses such as Pentax 16-45 f4 or 17-70mm f4.COMPETITORCanon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens Price: $750is a leading beginner cameras with 3\" hi-res LCD and 15 megapixel image resolution. The most important maybe the access to Canon extensive lenses. But this camera is more expensive and  slower in continuous burst (only 3.5 fps), no built-in image stabilization, and image is not as clean as Pentax Kx' image in high ISO setting.Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD Price: $700D5000 is also a great low light performer like its brother Nikon D90, but the problem with this camera is lack of built-in auto focus motor. This limit your lens selection. There is no built-in image stabilization either. Like Canon and Pentax beginner DSLR cameras, D5000 has live view and movie mode, plus swivel screen.Olympus Evolt E620 12.3MP Live MOS Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization and 2.7 inch Swivel LCD w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens Price: $700The E-620 is very small and compact because of smaller image sensor (which is actually a disadvantage). E-620 has swivel LCD screen and built-in image stabilization. Click the camera name for review.CONCLUSIONPentax Kx is a small wonder. It is great camera for low light condition, very portable (especially combined with Pentax pancake lenses), and the design is very user-friendly. It has two problems that prevent this camera to be the perfect beginner/enthusiasts camera: the active auto focus indicator is absent , and battery life is short when you use photo retouching features and record movie often. However, with the current price point, this camera gives you a  better value than its competitors.Subjective Rating - Relative to entry level DSLR cameras 2009Image Quality : 5/5Features : 5/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 5/5For image samples and iso comparison please visit my blog.

Struth", "ReviewID": "R2SHL953XXI58D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the K-X with the two lens kit with the 18-55 lens and the 55-300 lens.This is a wonderful little camera; the autofocus is fast and accurate, the menus are clear and easy to use, the picture modes let you play with your creativity or you can use it for just point and shoot, and it has manual control when you are ready to use it. I went with the long lens because I take a lot of detail shots and this lens does the trick for me. I haven't yet found a situation where I needed to zoom in closer, and when I do I can always buy a longer lens.  Back to size it's a great one handed camera to use, I find the camera comfortable to handle and it feels well made.I've taken about an hour of video so far; it can shoot up to 25 minutes of video at a time.  It's not a video camera but when you want to take a video spontaneously it works great.  For me the video is just icing on the cake.  The photos are what I bought the camera for.  I use mostly the aperture priority (to manipulate the depth of field or get low light shots) and the auto picture settings.  And they come out consistently crisp and accurate.  Sometimes you will have to manipulate the white balance settings especially when you use the low light capabilities of this camera without a flash, as with any DSLR. The camera has lots of digital filters to process your pictures with, and they are fun to use.  What I love most is being able to use the high ISO settings and not need a flash indoors and still get great quality shots.I use rechargeable batteries in the camera and have now downloaded the new firmware so the camera recognizes them faster.  This is a must do because before I had to turn the camera on and off and turn the live view on and off for it to recognize new batteries.  I played with a few sets of batteries to make sure they would work.  I'm saving the supplied lithium batteries to be a back up set when the rechargeable batteries get depleted.The in camera shake reduction works with all my lenses including my old manual lenses from 30 years ago.  The neat thing about using manual focus lenses (and wearing glasses like I do) with this camera is that you can set the camera to beep when you have focused the lens correctly, and there is also a visual indicator when you look thru the viewfinder. And every Pentax mount lens you buy will work with this camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow! What a great Camera!", "Author": "jackmaddy \"jackmaddy\"", "ReviewID": "RAC6TBK305IRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is only a preview and I will post a revised review in a few days.This is my first SLR camera so I have no frame of referrence other than my visits to camera shops to try a few out.  I was torn between the Canon T1I and the PENTAX K-X.  I took a look at the T1I and felt it was a bit on the cheap side. It was also a bit more expensive with less features and lens are very expensive.  Also I think the 1080P at 20 frames is a gimmick as is the whole HD video feature in SLR camera's.I have only had the Pentax K-X camera for 24 hours but cant get over the build quality.  It takes fantastic pictures and has more options and tweaks than you could ever want.  Its very easy to use right out of the box even for my wife, yet if you want to tweak your photos and get into it everything SLR offers, the options are there and then some.A few comments about the fact the camera does not come with rechargeable batteries and battery life in general: As for Battery life, I am using the supplied Lithium AA's I have used the camera for several hours, taking video and a couple hundred pictures, the battery is still showing as full!  As for no included rechargeables, this to me is a non issue.  1.  You can keep a spare set of batteries either alkaline or Lithium or even rechargeable which is what I plan to do.  I think this offers a ton of flexiblity and ensures you will never run out of juice!Also, the camera I purchased was a kit with both the 18-55mm and also 50-200mm lenses.  these lenses are great build and have excellent image results.Again, this is only a preview but what I have seen so far I am so glad I went with the Pentax over the Canon T1I!  More to come soon.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Big punch packed in a small body!", "Author": "waiehu92", "ReviewID": "R2K7IX42TT7RDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, my review's not going to rattle off all the specs and info you can find everywhere else on the 'net. Here's my two cents on actual experience with this camera...Low light shots are amazing! No need for flash with this camera...I've compared shots with/without flash...just wayyy better without flash...up to ISO 6400 is very, very usable. I took the camera for a shoot down Waikiki at night with very good results. You'll be amazed how many of your shots come out well with this camera, even running the auto setting! Auto focus is quite fast, and despite what some may say about the kit lenses (i got the kit with the 18-55mm and 55-300mm), the image quality is very sharp and clear, and the zoom and focus dials are really smooth. You get an actual manual focus ring unlike other entry level DSLRs. The layout of buttons on the camera to adjust f-stop and shutter speed is set up to be really user friendly. After a few shots, you don't even have to think about where the buttons are...they just make sense. I'm learning the manual settings and am getting to know the different effects the camera is capable of...but really, you'll be surprised how good night photos are, and how different shots are without flash, which gives a really artificial looking light. As far as video, I've taken good video with good natural light (daylight), but had video with lots of noise and grain with night shots. I've seen really great footage with f1.4-1.7 old lenses, and have a f1.7 on order and on the way. Do a \"pentax k-x\" search on Vimeo or Youtube and check out the footage...you'll be amazed at what's capable with wide open aperture and this camera for video. As far as how the camera feels in the hand, I'd say I have average size hands and it really feels solid for its size. The build quality, while not weatherproofed etc. like DSLRs that cost twice as much, has a quality feel all around. Battery life...I took roughly 1000 photos and about 10 minute or so videos, and the original lithium batteries are still at full. I bought an 8pk of Eneloops but didn't get a chance to use them yet!This camera got me hooked on taking photos, can't wait to take it out on my next outing!!Hope this was helpful to someone-", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Digital SLR, Love my K-x", "Author": "Mark BALCHER \"Digital Doctor/ Tech Titan\"", "ReviewID": "R1WVKP4TUVKM78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got the Pentax K-x in Black from Amazon. It arrived in only a few days, and Amazon provided me with a way to track my package, so I could see exactly where it was. I can't say enough about this wonderful camera. I've been shooting with SLRs for 25 years now, and this is the finest one I have ever used. It is such a pleasure to hold and use. You feel like you are holding something very special, as the build quality is top notch. The HD video feature is awesome, too. I've been tinkering around with HD video on my PC for a couple of years now, so I know all about the formats of HD. You are going to need a computer with a bit of muscle under the hood to be able to play your HD videos. I recommend a dual core processor. That should be enough to handle, playing your HD captures. It shoots video in the .avi format. And if you like to upload to YouTube, it works just fine. YouTube actually recognizes the video as being HD, and thus allows it to be played in their HD player. The other thing I love about this camera, is the RAW format. It lets you choose between the Pentax RAW (PEF), or the highly used .DNG (Digital Negative) format, which is so very versatile. I like shooting in .dng, since it's non proprietary, and Adobe Photoshop has no problem with it. As for the picture quality, and camera settings, they are what you would expect to be with any DSLR. I've always been a Canon guy, but couldn't resist this little gem. I'm so glad I opted for the Pentax, and have no regrets.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW Pentax K-x", "Author": "D. Kelley", "ReviewID": "R17N4V3JXBZ24D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first DSLR.  Have had Film SLR in the past and loved the creativity that can be accomplished with a manual camera. Hated the hassle and price of having film developed. Went to point and shoot digital and lost interest in photography. I picked up a friend's Canon DSLR and was instantly hooked again.Chose the Pentax because I have some old manual K mount lenses left from my film SLR. In retrospect after using the auto focus lens that comes on the K-x I will proebley very rarely if ever use my old K mount lenses.So the number one reason I chose the K-x was a poor choice on my part. But this is an awesome camera Here are what I like.1. Hand Shake compensation is built into the camera not the lens making lenses less expensive and it works extremely well.2. This is the most compact DSLR I have held. It fits my 8 year old daughter's hands and also fits my somewhat large 45 year old man hands at the same time.3. Simplicity of use. In auto mode my wife and daughter take excellent photos. (Think outstanding point and shoot.)4. Complexity all functions can be manipulated to give you full control of your photos. (Think Film SLR loaded with ISO 100 - 3200 film at the same time and full manual control of shutter speed, F-stop, Focus and any other thing you can think of.)5. Price this is a great first DSLR and possibly the only one you will ever need. It's not a pro DSLR but some times it thinks it is.6. 4.7 Fps this means your child is playing a sport as the ball comes toward him/her you push the button the camera will take 4.7 pictures every second for about 4 seconds depending on the speed of the SD card. I had an old SD card lying around I got about 5 pictures and it would slow down. I put new class 10 SD card in and it doesn't slow down for about 30 pictures.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best value and superb low light performance", "Author": "Photographer", "ReviewID": "RVE3K3V63UNAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Pentax dSLR, the others are Ds and K10. I was not really planning on getting a K-x, especially after I bought a Panasonic LX3 just 2 months ago. The published reviews suggested that it is too good to pass up; the price may go up as a result of the reviews. So I jumped. For the rest of this review, I will be comparing the K-x to my K10.AF performance is significantly improved. Even though I did not really feel that it was much faster, focus is dead on even in very poor light. There is no difference in AF speed for SDM lenses. Some people reported that they sometimes had problems with the K-x / Tamron 17-50 combination, I have yet seen that. I have to say that improvement in AF alone is enough to justify the upgrade for anyone with a Pentax older than K20.Noise performance is another area that K-x just left K10 in the dust. When both were set to ISO200 and at 400% magnification, darker areas remained smooth for K-x while the K10 was visibly noisy. With the limited experience at ISO6400, I am so far very pleased with K-x noise performance.I like a real optical view finder but I love LV for macro. I don't have any problem with the penta-mirror viewfinder. It might be a tad darker but you will hardly notice.Some people have reported that K-x has a larger dynamic range than K10; however, I cannot confirm that yet. I am hoping that this is indeed the case. It is safe to say that it is at least as good as K10.Before I placed the order, I was actually quite concerned with the lack of AF point indicators in the viewfinder. I think I am OK with this arrangement. It is obviously not as easy as K10 but not a deal breaker. As for the lack of a 2nd e-dial, it is again not a deal breaker since I also have a Ds which does not have a 2nd e-dial either. Weather sealing, not a deal breaker. I cannot justify spending another $500 just to get these features.There are plenty of significant improvements over the K10 to make K-x a keeper. There are just a few minor issues.Shutter/mirror is just as noisy as K10. I prefer the K7 but cannot justify the price difference. Again, it is not a deal breaker.I have relatively large hands and hope that someone will market a battery grip for K-x. I have a battery grip for K10.In summary, I can confirm the findings of many published reviews. It is a very capable camera and perhaps the best value in its market segment. It certainly took sales away from K7 but I think Pentax will increase market share at the expense of competition. BTW, it is also the cheaper dSLR in my collection. Great job Pentax.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could not be happier", "Author": "Engi_Nerd", "ReviewID": "R3K8S7OHP9GC6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After several agonizing months of research and forum crawling, I found myself firmly stuck between the Canon T1i and the Pentax k-x. [...] analysis of the Pentax ultimately sealed the deal for me, promising a compact and responsive starter DSLR with lots of headroom to grow in to (and for hundreds less than the canon). Having had the camera for a few days now (and promptly updating the firmware to avoid the nefarious battery issue)I can honestly say I could not be happier. The kit lens has proven more than sufficient for me to cut my teeth on and can definitely produce sharp, vibrant pictures, provided you're not relying on the idiot setting. The button and menu layout is concise and accessible, allowing you to learn the camera inside and out in only a day's time. The camera itself is extremely compact but still manages to have a very solid and comfortable feel. And as so many have noted, the high-iso capabilities allow you to shoot in available light with fantastic results. And while hardcore photographers complain they're pointless, the in-camera filters and cross processing abilities give great results with minimal effort and absolutely add value to the camera. My only gripes thus far are the lack of focus points in the viewfinder (which i wouldn't actually use but feel i should get for spending 6 bills) and the AA batteries, which were easily remedied with a set of Eneloops. All in all though a FANTASTIC camera and ridiculous bargain. If you're reading this you want the k-x but are probably worried about going non-Canikon.

The K-x feels solid and quality built, this is great for the class and has features that many more expensive cameras lack. I shot a few pictures and they are looking awesome... I will need more time to do a complete review, but overall the K-x looks great. I think this Camera has tremendous Value and will push more consumers to look at Pentax for dSLR. Many ppl forget or don't know the great Film Pentax's of the past.A few notes:1. Yes the camera comes without a SDHC Card, but Camera's lack this anyway. (I purchased a 16GB Class 6 SDHC ~$32).2. The Camera comes with Lithium AA Batteries, but you can use Ni-MH Rechargeable AA also.3. Included Kit lens 18-55mm is sharp and takes great pictures...4. You can use many film/dSLR Pentax Lenses going back about 50 years, this mount is compatible.I will update my review after some good photo work. The K-x does lack HDMI connection (only USB) so you can't playback from the Camera the 780p Video to a TV with USB. I will have to load my SDHC Card into my PS3 or Laptop for viewing/editing in 780p.

The K-x now makes that easier than ever. Also, being compatible with every Pentax lens made in the last 50 years is a huge plus. I picked up an inexpensive 50mm f1.7 prime on eBay and have been having fun shooting with that too. Much sharper (when stopped down) and faster (when opened up) than the kit lens which is ok but not fantastic.Shooting around the house without having the use a flash is also a huge advantage. The shots just look more natural and when shooting it's less intrusive for my subjects to not have the flash going off all the time.The two things I would add to this would be the weather seals found in the  higher Pentax models and AF illumination (the rod spot that tells you what point is focused).I haven't had any problems due to lack of seals yet, but the peace of mind would be nice while taking it out into the elements.Video is ok but not great. That's a nice feature that I probably will not use a whole lot but it's nice to know I have the capability if the right opportunity arises.Be sure to upgrade the firmware to 1.01 if your camera doesn't already have that version.

Brown \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R1LWCJF20BDKFD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently picked up photography. My first camera was a little Casio Exlim point-and-shoot that I bought for school projects. I soon found myself taking pictures of non-school related subjects. From there, I bought a Lumix ZS3 point and shoot, which had better image quality and a few more manual settings. Then I stepped it up to the Lumix FZ35, which had all of the basic manual controls, and decent image quality as well; however it lacked the image quality that I've been seeking. What does this have to do with the Pentax K-X? Well, if you have followed a similar path in photography, perhaps the points that I convey will be of use to you knowing the context from which they come from.I looked, and looked, and looked for a reasonably priced DSLR; I researched at nauseam comparing specs and sample pictures. I found 4 highly regarded DSLR's within my price range. The Pentax K-X, Nikon D5000, Canon T1i, and Olympus E620. I'll be brief and spare you the details. The Olympus was the least impressive, with the most impressive feature being it's articulated LCD screen. Image quality was just okay. The Canon appeared to produce the better image of the four, but only just. However the Canon struggles in low-light; I'm a fan of low light, so I checked the Canon off of my list (It was also the most expensive of the four, by $150 or so.). That left me with the Pentax and Nikon...image quality was most important to me, followed by specification, then features. Both the Nikon and Pentax use a similar sensor...however, the Nikon's images tend to be softer, as opposed to the Pentax which produces sharper and more true-to-color images. Both perform well in low light conditions, however the Pentax maintains greater details, as the Nikon's image softens as light decreases. In my research, the Pentax's performance in low light conditions was often compared to high-end DSLRs in performance.Video was not a must for me, but a convenient feature, and both the Nikon and Pentax have HD video. Really, the only significant feature that Nikon has over the Pentax...an articulated screen.

It's my first DSLR but after reading up a bit on its capabilities I was good to go. For the price, this is simply an amazing camera. I had considered entry-level models from Canon and Nikon, but after reading a bunch of online reviews I decided that the K-x was a better bet. Indeed, the sensor quality and features (it shoots great 720p video) are unbeatable in its segment.A few likes and dislikes:Likes:I shoot from the viewfinder. I'm not sure if this is because the LCD isn't big enough or because I just like shooting from the viewfinder better - probably the latter. I like to use a manual focus when the situation allows, and I can just see a lot more using my naked eye instead of live view.The video feature is great for casual shooting. I used it on Christmas morning to capture my 18 month old opening gifts.Since I rarely use live view, rarely use a flash and set up my shots before turning the camera on, the original batteries have lasted me about two weeks. Can't complain about that. I bought 8 Eneloop AAA rechargeables for when the originals run out, but haven't had to swap them out yet.Low light performance is amazing. Check out the reviews. It's as good as cameras that cost twice as much.Dislikes:The audio is mono on the camera, and there's no audio input. So if you want to shoot something with sound, i.e. an interview, you'll have to use a separate recorder and sync the audio later. That's probably too much of a hassle for a project with a lot of cuts, but if it's something simple it's workable. I managed to sync some audio in iMovie that looks/sounds really good.The shutter is on the loud side. I haven't yet found this to be a real problem for me, but some reviewers have been annoyed by it.It's rare for me to get a decent-looking picture using the internal flash. Some of that is probably just the nature of internal flash, but I'm guessing some of it owes to the implementation in the K-x. Fortunately, images still look good at ISO 1600 and usable at ISO 3200, so it's possible to get up to a high enough shutter speed to take photos of a toddler indoors during the day.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Pentax K-x is a giant killer!", "Author": "Edgar_in_Indy", "ReviewID": "R28C1KZNPJEBKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from my beloved Olympus e-510 DSLR with the 14-42mm and 40-150mm kits lenses in order to get a DSLR with better low-light performance and HD video capabilities. I loved my Olympus, but image quality took a nose-dive at ISO 800, and I liked the idea of having an HD camcorder built into my camera to capture high quality family photos and home videos in one device. I eventually settled on the Pentax K-x after first buying, and then returning, a Canon T2i.I know that the T2i costs almost twice as much as the K-x, and they're not direct competitors, but I think my experience illustrates what a great camera and bargain the K-x is and how, for me at least, it was a giant killer.I initially pre-ordered a T2i for the $900 MSRP after reading the glowing reviews in the press about the 18MP sensor, the high-ISO performance and the killer 1080p video. When I received the T2i, I was surprised by how cheap and plasticky it felt. It's not that the T2i was likely to fall apart, but my Olympus felt and looked like a higher quality camera, even though it was about $200 less than the T2i when I bought it. I realize that the T2i is a Rebel, but for almost $1000, I expected something more solid.Even worse was the Canon 18-55mm kit lens, which felt like a toy compared to my Olympus kit lenses. It looked cheap, and the zoom action felt very cheap, and you could hear plastic-on-plastic as you zoomed in and out. There was no lens hood included, and the optional lens hood was only about an inch deep and looked ridiculous. The front element rotated when auto-focusing, which makes using some filters problematic, and you had to switch off AF to manually make focus adjustments. My Olympus lenses did not rotate the front element, and allowed full time focus override without turning off AF. And build-wise, they looked and felt like a higher end lens. But worst of all, Canon kits lens's optical performance was lacking, rendering the 18MP sensor moot.I could live with the cheap feel of the T2i body and the ugly jelly-bean design, but I came to realize that in order to get a lens that would match the performance of the body, I would need to shell out another $500 or more, and as a hobbyist I just didn't have the budget.The real deal-breaker with the T2i though, was the use of Quicktime format for the HD video. Quicktime is a proprietary Apple video format, and while I must assume it works well on a new Mac, the QT videos often gave PCs problems. I'd read about this from other users, but I figured that with my high-end PCs and my computer knowledge, I would be okay. But both my new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7, ATI 4650 graphics and 4GB of RAM and my desktop computer with Windows XP, dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Raptor 10K HDD and nVidia 8800GT graphics would stutter on playback of the 1080p files. And finding affordable programs to edit Quicktime HD video files is another headache. I wasn't about to buy a new Mac just to be able to work with the video from my new camera.So back went the T2i, and my quest for a new camera continued. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Nikon D5000, when I came across the Pentax K-x.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the styling. I thought the red was killer, but I wasn't that brave. And the camera looked dead-sexy in navy blue, but when I saw the white version, I was in love. One thing I liked about my Olympus was that it was something DIFFERENT than all the Nikons and Canon Rebels you see every other parent carrying to school or sports functions. I would often get questions about it from people who didn't realize that Olympus even MADE DSLRs. With this Pentax, I would again have something out of the ordinary.Then I started reading reviews of the K-x. One of the great things about the T2i is the high ISO image quality, and according to the reviews and the sample images I was looking at, the K-x was right there with it.And the K-x also did HD video. There were some limitations, such as 720p and lack of full control over exposure while shooting video, but I didn't really mind since the samples I downloaded looked great, even on my 110\" 1080P home theater projector. And 720p files take less space than 1080p and require less processing power to playback and edit. And best of all, the K-x uses Motion JPEG video format, which plays back great on PCs and is compatible with almost any Windows video editing program. The MJPEG format does use more disk space than the equivalent QT file, but hard drives and SD cards are cheap these days, so it's not a big deal.Another great thing about the K-x is that it has sensor-based image stabilization in the body, so any lens you stick on the camera is stabilized. My Olympus used a similar system, and I was very happy with it. The big advantage is that you can buy non-stabilized lenses so they'll be smaller, lighter, less expensive, and (theoretically) more reliable.I ended up buying the K-x in white with the 18-55mm lens. The K-x looks and feels like a higher quality camera than the T2i, and matches my Olympus in this department. The kit lens is also a very worthy piece of hardware.With the money I saved on the Pentax, I was able to buy the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, a Pentax 55-300mm zoom lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The flash was new, but I got great deals on the slightly-used lenses on eBay and Craigslist. ($300 for the Tamron on eBay, $150 for the 55-300mm Pentax on Craigslist).I've been using the Pentax for a couple months now, and have taken hundreds of pictures. I am absolutely thrilled with the camera and couldn't be happier with the photos and videos I'm getting. The T2i did have just slightly more detail, but other than that I would say the K-x has equal image quality. And the 12MP RAW image files of the K-x are faster to work with than the 18MP files of the T2i and take up much less space on SD cards, so you don't have to worry about filling up nearly as fast.There's not too much negative I can say about the camera. I would like it to have a mini-HDMI port and a standard mini-USB port, and continuous auto-focus would be nice in video mode, but no other DSLR has that yet. Stereo mics and even a mic jack would also be very welcome.I suspect that the image stabilization system may not be as good as the one in my Olympus, but I can't say for sure since my Pentax telephoto is longer than the telephoto I had with the Olympus (450mm equivalent vs 300mm for the Olympus) and will therefore be more prone to shake.I get compliments on the Pentax everywhere I go, and it's been a joy to use and own. I could not be happier with my purchase.In the future I'll probably add a Sigma 30mm F1.4 prime and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide zoom to my lens kit.Just for the record, I'm not trying to bash on the T2i. It is an amazing camera that is currently without peer in its price range. But if you're like me and you only have about $1000 to spend, I think you will get much more value by going with a less-expensive but almost-as-capable camera like the K-x, and using the extra money on high quality lenses. My F2.8 constant-aperture lens has been a revolution for me, and I recommend every budding photographer make room in their budget for something similar.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Made a Pentax Fan Out of Me", "Author": "Bill Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R2D81LYLZNVCCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the K-x shortly after it came out. I got it with the kit 18-55 zoom and the 50-200 zoom. To call this an entry level camera is a disservice. It may be easy enough for a newbie, but the capabilities and options in it go far beyond an \"entry\" level. The main reason I was interested in the K-x was for the low light performance, and it is everything they say. It is even more so with better lenses and understanding of the settings. The batteries are the only issue but I have not had a problem. I bought 2 sets of eneloops and just keep them charged and ready. I have never got caught out of juice. I did seek to upgrade the lenses after a while. One of the best features owning a Pentax is you can get lenses as good or better than Canon or Nikon for 1/3 to 1/2 the cost. You can also fit almost any lens Pentax ever made on the camera. I've picked up a few cheap lenses on Craiglist to get a feel for what I'd like in a new lens. I replaced the 50-200 kit zoom with a DA* 50-135 f/2.8 and it is mind-bogglingly (if that's a word) better. The images it produces have a distinct quality that makes them almost 3D. It's an expensive lens but, believe me, it's worth it. Take my advice on this, though: don't bother looking for a better standard zoom. The Pentax 18-55 kit zoom is one of the best kit lenses available. I compared it to the DA* 18-55 f/2.8 and Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 and returned both. Neither produced noticeably better images and they did not have the kind of \"pop\" produced by the DA* 50-135. There just isn't that big a difference to justify the extra cost (it is justified for the 50-135 f/2.8). Be satisfied you have a good standard zoom and maybe get a good prime lens instead. One of the neat features I really like in the K-x is the HDR function. If you take architectural photos, especially at night, it can produce unbelieveable images. The other thing I like is the green button you can assign certain functions to. I have it set to focus when I press it with my thumb. I prefer doing it that way than pressing half way down on the shutter. Don't be afraid to buy this camera. I know Canon and Nikon are the heavy weights, but after owning a Pentax, and reading stuff from other users and reviewers, you come to realize Pentax is not an underdog.

I use the camera with the accompanying 18-55 mm zoom lens as well as lenses from my old Pentax SLR with great results with each lens.  I had resisted making the move to digital for years because I liked the comfort of knowing what I would get with my film SLR camera, but a few years ago I bought a point and shoot digital for my wife; who never felt completely comfortable with my camera. I found myself using her digital more and more frequently because of the instant gratification of seeing the results right on the spot.  I also found myself more and more frustrated with the limitations of the point and shoot including shutter delay and inability to get the results I wanted and was used to with my film SLR.  The clincher came one day when we were at the park with my 2 year old granddaughter and I grabbed my wife's camera to take some pictures as my granddaughter ran joyfully from play equipment to play equipment.  The results were photos of her running out of the scene unless I was able to guess how much to \"lead\" her when I took the picture to account for the shutter delay.That same day I ordered the Pentax KX from Amazon and with the Prime shipping got the camera two days later with free shipping.  The camera does everything I want and was used to getting with my old film SLR and then some.  The colors are great, the stop action is unbelievable and with the various settings I am able to get the pictures I want with the effects I want.  For me part of the beauty of the camera is that I can use an automatic setting like the \"kids\" setting that allows shooting at over 4 frames per second and delivers excellent skin tones or I can control everything from ISO to shutter speed in a manual mode.  Yet it is easy enough to use that my wife has discarded her point and shoot and now uses my camera in the auto mode just like a point and shoot but with better results.The added benefit of being able to use my old Pentax lenses has been a great cost savings.  I love the ability of the camera to signal when a frame is in focus, even using these old lenses that have an \"A\" setting on them.  Great camera, great price, great service from Amazon.

I looked into entry level DSLR's and came across this particular camera. I did my due diligence looking at offerings from Canon and Nikon but to me this camera offered the most appealing features at the lowest cost. I particularly liked the low noise at high ISO's.When I first received the camera I put in 4 powermax AA batteries but the camera wouldn't turn on (it also comes with 4 energizer lithium batteries), luckily I purchased a few sets of Sanyo eneloop batteries and it turned on after I put those in. After this, I immediately upgraded the firmware to 1.01 which was a very simple process. However this firmware didn't fix the issues with the powermax batteries, but I don't really mind that. Since I'm a newbie to DSLR, I used the built in automatic picture mode and I had decent results. I did some research and looked up the terminology (shutter, aperture, ev, iso, etc.) and started using manual mode. After hundred's of shots and trial & error I started getting the hang of it and started taking awesome photos. I'm very happy with the image quality of this camera, you can see some of my shots in the amazon product gallery. However, even with image stabilization on it seems to be very sensitive to movement. Slight movement on my part and I get some blur, so be careful with that. I've only slightly used the special features such as HDR, color removal, video (720p at 24fps) etc. but from the limited use they seem to be pretty cool features.This camera seems to be very picky when it comes to batteries (evidenced by it's refusal to turn on with my powermax batteries) but it works great with the Sanyo eneloops. With liveview on I could take only around 200 photos before I got a battery warning. Without liveview and just using the viewfinder I took more than 2000 shots and the camera's battery meter would just be drained halfway. Some don't really like the AA batteries but I love it, very easy to find and use.The 18-55mm kit lens included is sufficient but I found myself at times wanting a bigger lens... For instance, the time I was at the top of the Eiffel Tower I wanted to zoom in to get a nice close up shot of Notre Dame Cathedral, but unfortunately the kit lens couldn't zoom in far enough to get a decent shot.Overall, I really love this camera. It's one of the best purchases I made, very satisfied customer.

Image quality is superb and make sure you get yourself some quality filters, the IR remote control and a good quality tripod to make it even better. It does take a bit of time to figure out all the settings and controls since there are so many of them available (I am still finding things here and there that I had no idea the camera could do) but the interface and menu is VERY easy and very user friendly. Overall quality of the camera is excellent and that is what Pentax is known for. As for the 18-55mm lens it came with, great lens for everyday shooting. You might want to consider getting one of the other lens packages as I kinda regret not having another telephoto lens on hand. I will buy one later, but if you have a camera like this you would want to get another lens anyways, so why not save some money now with the great bundles Pentax has available.Video quality is great if you record in a well lit room or outside (just like any other camcorder). I still need to figure out the auto focusing while filming which is just a matter of selecting the right configuration.The only thing I don't like is that if you want to shoot in HDR Mode (High Dynamic Range Imaging) which combines 3 shots together and pretty much gives you the best quality shots, you cannot set the timer on. So even if you have the best tripod out there, when you press the shoot button, the push slightly shakes the camera on the first image which makes the outcome of the 3 combined images slightly blurry. I don't understand why the countdown timer is not available for this mode. The only way to take an HDR picture is if you get the infrared remote or program your universal TV remote control to work with your camera ( it's an infrared signal, same signal you use to change a channel on your TV with your remote.All in all, this a a superb camera for all your needs and a great first DSLR for rookies like me. Very sturdy quality built and easy one hand operation.

And even now after owning a new Canon 60D (for its swivel screen), I still cannot let go of the k-x!Updated: 7/20/11I bought the Canon T2i at the same time as the Pentax k-x for a direct comparison. After much debate, I ended up returning the T2i for my own personal reasons. Keep in mind, every camera has pros and cons, and the best camera for you is the one you use in your hands.1) AF and 3D trackingT2i: Does not beep nor show light indicators while it tracks movement.K-x: No focus indicators at all (except during phase-detect live-view), but fast AF with beeps.2) Low-Light assist beamT2i: Fail. Does strobe-like, seizure-inducing effect with the pop-up flash.K-x: Fail. Ditto.3) FlashT2i: Attempts to default to ISO400. Powerful.K-x: Fail. Weaker and not as elevated above camera.4) External FlashT2i: Has a good small flash (270EX) that uses 2 AA batteries. Cycles fast n quiet, lightweight high sync above 1/180. Can adjust exposure in-camera.K-x: Ok options. Little outdated. Only larger, regular-sized external flashes. But camera has built-in wireless flash control = Nice.5) Live ViewT2i: Good AF speed. Does not show histogram. Keeps mirror open when changing modes or playback.K-x: Contrast AF speed sucks. Phase-detect is much faster. Mirror is noisy.6) Color AccuracyT2i: Reds look good in JPG.K-x: Deep reds look magenta in JPG using default settings. Blue skies are vivid.7) NoiseT2i: JPG has better algorithm. Keeps more detail. More noise in shadow areas.K-x: RAW files has excellent performance. JPG engine too harsh.8) FocusT2i: Shows focus points, sensitive to color of light. Has 1 cross-type sensor.K-x: Must resort to center focus and recompose shooting style. Can use manual lenses with cheap vintage glass. Has 9 cross-type sensors.9) White BalanceT2i: Fail indoors. Would have to use flash. Custom white balance is a pain.K-x: Good Auto. Custom white balance is easy to use too.10) Battery LifeT2i: Has proximity sensors to turn off LCD. Li-ion about 400 shots. Can accomodate battery grip.K-x: Easy to find AA batteries. No battery grip. Up to 800 shots with manual lens. Eneloop FTW.11) Viewfinder InfoT2i: Shows buffer and exposure.K-x: More readable F number and shows custom modes12) Instant ReplayT2i: Must press Play button before zooming in, does not show blinking exposed areas or ISOK-x: Good. Can custom zoom quickly, but to see ISO must press INFO button13) BodyT2i: A little bigger, very light and plasticy.K-x: Compact, more sturdy and heavier.14) MeteringT2i: Features Active D+ lighting which protects highlights well or ALO for shadow.K-x: Has highlight and shadow optimzing, athough more subtle, both can be turned on simultaneously.15) Dynamic RangeT2i: About average for JPG and RAW. Confirm withed ImageResourceK-x: JPG sucks but RAW is top 5 superb.16) Image correctionT2i: Corrects vignetting, does not slow down bufferK-x: Corrects distortion and/or CA but slows down buffer a lot17) Shadow NoiseT2i: JPG are malleable, comparable to RAW files. More chroma noise present, but NR gives better results.K-x: JPG best without NR applied. RAW files less chroma. NR too harsh.18) Video modeT2i: Auto aperture seemless. Autofocus useless. Many formats. Efficient playback H.264, heavy editing H.264. External mic capable. Hackable with tons more options with Magic Lantern.K-x: Auto aperture a bit jerky. No autofocus. No ext mic. Huge files motion JPEG format, easy editing. In-body stabilization noisy.  Can use with 3rd party lens with OS for quieter stabilization - just keep shutter half-pressed.19) FeaturesT2i: 18mp sensor and metering from 7D. Great modern lens ecosystem.K-x: Intervalometer, HDR, more presets such as Extract color, wireless flash, in-camera RAW processing. Compatibility with all Pentax bayonet vintage glass during film era.BOTTOM LINE:T2i: No worries camera. Not very customizable though. The \"reliable\" camera.K-x: Capable of better results with work. Feature-rich. The \"robust\" camera.Tips for K-x:During liveview in Auto mode there is a secret mode called \"Blue sky\" that appears on its own in certain conditions (outdoors). It is not found anywhere else in the camera.Look into \"modset.492\" hack to fine tune AF for front or back focus.

I was considering the Nikon D5000 or the Sony A390, but I could get everything those had for a lower price in the K-x (& Pentax is a well-known name in the world of SLRs). It quickly arrived and the past five weeks I have been learning the wonderful world of DSLRs. The camera fits my hand very comfortably - it doesn't feel large or awkward or too heavy to hold. (I wasn't sure about this b/c it was the one camera I was considering that I was never able to actually \"touch\" in real life). The menu is easy to read and the placement of the controls make sense. The menu layout is great - it has pages to each menu as opposed to a long list to scroll down through. You can see the options at a glance. The video mode is more than adequate. Live view for picture-taking lags a bit, but with a DSLR, it's so much easier to just use the optical viewfinder. Probably a beginner thing to say, but I like how the card slot is independent from the battery slot. I've taken 1600+ photos on the batteries that came with the camera and they're still going. The flash fills a large room and the camera can handle low-light well (but need a steady hand!) As a beginner, this camera has been great to learn on and I know it can do so much more than I am capable of at the moment.

I say 'at this' time because as my photography grows so will my needs. The Pentax Kx is super light weight and fits the hand so nicely for one hand shooting. It snaps pics in a jiff with great clarity and gives you that instant gratification.The only con I have found is it is a bit on the noisy side. This really only matters of you are trying to sneak up on sleeping subjects like cats, the focus and shutter might disturb them. But seriously, that is the only con I have found in the month and half of owning this camera. I use my camera EVERYDAY and was concerned about battery usage. I was afraid that I would be purchasing batteries constantly but have found it to be quite the opposite. I only recently had to change the batteries that came with the camera and that was after snapping almost 2000 shots and leaving it on for periods of time. Oops.The kit lens is great and gives such amazing clarity. I have pushed the lens' limits and have not been disappointed, but that also goes with Pentax being a top notch product. I think one of the main reasons I went with this model is the fact that I can use my old Pentax SLR lenses. Bonus!I also recently purchased some budget lenses by Tamron and although in the product description it mentions pretty much every Pentax model BUT the Kx, I took a chance and purchased them any ways and found that it does fit and works just dandy. That's a review for another time.Oh and I can't forget about my two favourite features, the Digital Filters and the HD Video capability. You can snap all the pics you want then while viewing them on the LCD you can go into the menu options and add a digital filter such as \"Toy Camera\", \"Retro\", \"High Contrast\", \"Extract Colour\", \"Soft\", \"Starburst\", and my personal favourite, \"Fish Eye\". You can also create your own custom filter and adjust the intensity of the previous mentioned ones to your desire. Seriously, awesome!The HD Video is a great feature that impressed me the first time I tested it. Compared to my other (older) video recorders, the sound and video clarity is immediately noticable. It's such a nice bonus to be able to capture both photos and video with a turn of a dial.So overall the Pentax kx camera is the best purchase I  have made in a long long time and if you are debating to purchase this or not, I say go for it!

I wanted to upgrade to more pixels and faster burst speed, but did not want to obsolete the lens, flash and other accessories I had accumulated.  I initially considered the K200d, but at $700 - $750, it did not seem to be a good value. At $470 at Amazon, the K-x was a very good value. There are many full reviews on the web, I'll address only the \"negatives\" these reviews mention.I initially had two worries, the lack of a focus indicator in the viewfinder, and reported \"soft\" images by one trusted reviewer.  It turns out that the lack of a focus indicator is not the problem I thought it might be. I'd like to have one, but I can live without it. JPEG images right from the camera might be subjectively a little soft, but I have not compared the two cameras side by side with the same lens. In any event, I believe any photo good enough to show people is worth a minute or two on Photoshop.  After the routine sharpening I don't see any softness.The K-x is smaller than the K200d. It is still easy to grip, but I think I like the larger camera body anyway. I use my Sigma 70-300 almost all the time, and a lens this large offsets the value of a smaller body. If I used a more compact lens the smaller body size might be a nice feature.The camera uses AA batteries. I used rechargeables in the K100, and planned to use them in K-x as well. The lithium batteries that came with the camera have already taken 1,500 photos and the battery meter has not moved off \"full\".  I purchased 3 sets (12 batteries) of \"ultimate\" lithiums at Sam's Club for $21.  The shelf life is 15 years.  If I can get 4,500 photos for $21 I might not bother with rechargeables.I do not use \"automatic\", but also do not use a lot in the camera's built in features. Most of my settings are still default, although I have experimented with adustments to contrast and \"dynamic range\". I have not even tried live view or video experimentally.  Most of my subjects are horses and cats.  Their attention span is measure in fractions of seconds, and they will never pose, and rarely stand still once you point a camera in their direction. I like to concentrate on the subject, composition, background etc and strive for a usable image I can clean up in Photoshop.

Gandhi \"RonakG\"", "ReviewID": "R2YC0VI6W9LDCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first DSLR 3 weeks back.  And to surprise to a lot of people, it is a Pentax K-x.  I chose to go with Pentax K-x over Nikon D3100 and Canon 500D.  I get asked \"WHY Pentax\" many times. Well, modern-day cameras are very much advanced and are very capable.  All are so close in terms of IQ that it is difficult to decide on one.  Because of this, we need to consider other aspects of them to come to a conclusion.So let's begin -* In-body image stabilization - Pentax offers in-body image stabilization that both Canon and Nikon don't.  Pentax has implemented image stabilization in the camera body by using sensor shift mechanism.  The sensor shifts itself (kind of vibrates) at a very fast rate to compensate with the camera shake induced by shaky hands of the photographer.  Main advantage of in-body image stabilization is - well, it is in body.  So, ANY lens you mount on the camera becomes stabilized by default. In contrast, Canon and Nikon prefer image stabilization in lenses, which makes the lenses bigger and of course expensive.* Ergonomics - My Pentax K-x just feels right in my hands.  All the controls are at the right place.  The body is smallest of the lot with just right amount of weight. The Canon was the worst of the lot with the Nikon coming very close to the Pentax.* Low light IQ - This is where Pentax scores most.  This has become Pentax's USP since K-x, K-5 and now K-r.  Pentax takes a conservative approach towards noise reduction to retain details in photos.  This enables us to process the image the way we want. The noise reduction software are getting better and better day by day, so I'd prefer to do it in the computer with all the processing power and intelligence than in camera.* Fastest among the lot - The K-x can shoot at 4.7 frames per second.  This is the fastest burst shooting rate among the three cameras.  Though I won't need such high-speed shooting everyday, it's a nice to have feature.Backward compatibility with older glass - Pentax has maintained backward compatibility with all old lenses they have ever made.  So I can use ANY Pentax lens EVER made with my K-x.  Some of the prime manual focus lenses are very cheap in second-hand market. Though Canon and Nikon both have a larger set of lenses on offer, Pentax gives me way more choices than I will ever buy.Largest and brightest view-finder* Bang for the buck - Have you ever seen a Pentax advertisement on TV or a hoarding on a road?  I haven't, because Pentax doesn't spend much on marketing.  They are a very small company focused on R&D; behind their products.  This enables them to price their products lower compared to Canon and Nikon.  I bought my K-x along with 18-55mm and 55-300mm lenses for USD 629.  In this amount with Canon I would have only got the body, or with Nikon one kit lens with the body.One negative point for Pentax is their absence in retail outlets.  Not sure why but Pentax don't stock enough cameras, lenses and accessories in retail electronic stores.  This keeps prospective customers away from trying a Pentax camera in the store.  They don't have good service network too in most of the countries.  In India, they don't have any presence at all. So if this matters to you, you may want to be safe and go with either of Canon or Nikon.The main point going against the Nikon D3100 was the stripped down body.  Nikon has removed the focus motor from the D3100, so the lens has to have a focus motor to auto focus.  It also doesn't have the bracketing feature, which is considered very basic and very useful for HDR imaging.  Nikon tends to do such things with their entry-level DLSRs.The main point going against the Canon was the price and how quickly they obsolete camera bodies.  500D is now 2 generations old camera as 550D is in market since few months now and 600D already been announced.If I had a little more budget, I would have gone for the Pentax K-r.  It is new and improved K-x with things like -* Dedicated AF assist lamp.  It helps the camera in focusing in very low light (no entry-level DSLR has this).* Visible focus points in view-finder (most K-x reviews rant about this point)* 3 inch LCD with 921k pixels* Even higher shooting rate of 6 fpsSo there I have it, the Pentax K-x.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just an Amazing camera.", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R35X89MBWZ1084", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply awesome.

I haven't seriously handled an SLR since the late 80s/early 90s when I had a Minolta Maxxum.  Real life and raising a family made me put my passion for photography on the back burner.It's my passion, so I knew I wanted to get into it again, but the prices of the cameras were astronomical for me until I saw this camera. OMG.Okay, so my old Ricoh (70s) and the Minolta were fine cameras.  But they didn't require a degree to figure out all of the controls.  I'm a pretty quick study, so I had them up and going in no time. The only thing that kept me from doing more was, of course, the price of film.  Now that film is not in the equation, I'm shooting rolls and rolls and loving it. Each shot teaches me a little more and I'm getting better and better.This little camera is the bomb.  I purchased this and the Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens for Pentax Digital SLR Cameras (it was cheaper separately at the time I purchased them rather than the bundle), and I haven't regretted it even for a microsecond.  While the controls on this (and every DSLR) are a little daunting, I have managed to crank out some photos that amaze me.  I've Photoshopped a few choice ones and they are, in a word, stunning.The two things I'm loving most about this camera are the low-light and the macro features.  I've been able to take awesome shots in places that are poorly but beautifully lit (hey! this is Vegas!).  I've gotten **this close** to bees and flowers and taken gorgeous shots.  I can't believe the quality.The cons are that for some reason, it is reluctant to focus in low-light situations when the LV is running.  And I haven't upgraded the firmware.  One day.  The other con is that although I've used the video function a couple of times ... it leaves a little to be desired.  Of course, my *real* video camera is a Canon DV, and gives almost broadcast-quality footage.  This has a little ways to go to equal that camera, but it's okay in a pinch.  The video feature also sucks battery power big time.So purchase it for the stills, not for the video.This camera is a treasure, and I'm so glad that the quality and price have been able to resurrect my photography passion without killing my budget. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this camera.  By the way, I purchased black because I think the colors are, well, *hokey.*Update 10/2010I'm updating this review because I want to let folks know that it's still the most amazing camera I've ever owned.  Disclosure:  New iMac with Photoshop.  Therefore, decided advantage.This little camera continues to amaze me.  I figured out (by reading the manual) how to do HDR photos, and the rest is history.  My photos are posted on my employer's intranet, and I get compliments every day.  It's lightweight, easy to use, and a wonderful possession.  I gave this five stars when I'd only had it a couple of months, and several months later, I wish I could give it ten.  It doesn't have the controls and screens that you'll see on the higher end Nikons and Canons, but the photos are the final story.  And mine are fabulous.

If you do not feel like spending thousands of $$$ on your dSLR setup, then this camera is a great choice. You might just want to buy a more flexible lens, such as Sigma 18-200mm for Pentax (or anything similar according to your preference and budget) as the kit lenses are not as multifunctional as this Sigma. You might want to buy just the body and then choose your optics.I think that the 4 AA battery power source is a great choice and a money-saver, but you have to buy good quality batteries (lithium or NiMH) in order to avoid any disappointment that is inevitable when you try to use cheap Alkalines in a high-drain device such as a full-featured digital camera. I use NiMH batteries from respectable manufacturers (Sanyo, MAHA, Lenmar) and they work just fine.My Pentax K-x went through spontaneous photo shoots, low-light long distance photo shoots, a vacation in a mountainous wilderness and I do not see any negative impact upon its performance or looks. Just make sure that you use the proper lens wiping sheets with Methanol to clean the lenses and filters. Do use a good UV filter at all times to keep the lenses our of trouble. Make sure that you change your lens in a clean environment or at least, do it quickly and use a body cap in the process.Most importantly, though, once you get your K-x, download and install the latest Firmware update. Doing so can make your photo shooting experience somewhat better.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW!

Building on my earlier investments was important to me.  While I have not really explored all the new features of my K-x, these are my initial reactions.The Kx is marginally smaller.One of the features that I liked in the K100D, a separate settings display panel has been removed.  It did not take long to get use to activating a settings display on the viewing display panel.  My only concern is the additional drain this may create on the batteries.The battery utilization seems improved.  I transferred two sets of my rechargeable  AA batteries to the K-x and I seem to be getting more pictures on each charge than I had been with the K100D.Since I shoot all my pictures in the RAW format; I was worried about the storage demands imposed by the 12 megapixel images of the K-x compared the 6 megapixel images of the K100D.  It has turned out that there is much more variation in the size of the Pentax RAW formatted images on the K-x.  As a result the RAW files created by the K-x up to this point range between 12 and 19 megabytes.  The average is about 15 megabytes.  With the K100D most images were very close to 10 megabytes in size.  If this holds up I'm getting images that have twice the resolution with only a 50% increase in file size.I was also pleasantly surprised that the programs that I use to process my digital image (Bibble 5 and Paint Shop Pro X2) did not bog down when handling the larger files.  If there is any slow down in processing time associated with the larger images, it has seemed negligible so far.I've had no problem in using my third party lenses with the new camera.After only a couple hundred images on the K-x, I am satisfied that I has met all the expectations that I had when I purchased it.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprising High ISO pics and JPEG engine", "Author": "Concerned Cit \"Concerned Cit.\"", "ReviewID": "RCEBJRTE68C3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "from Dpreview linked here at amazon.com on the Pentax K-x: \"Its high ISO JPEGs are possibly the best of all current DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor; they certainly beat any of its direct competitors.\"\"With this performance the K-x easily beats most other APS-C cameras whenshooting JPEGs, including much more expensive models.

Almost everything about this DSLR is better than my old megazoom, but it is not completely perfect.Autofocus is quick and accurate, although it may occasionally hunt in really low light. Contrast detect AF in Live View is a different story though-unbelievably slow. However this is not a problem for me, so it is not influencing my rating of this product.The camera is a bit compact compared to the Canon Rebel T1i/500D I tested out at the store, but it handles nicely, the handgrip is (for this price segment) large and comfortable, and while there are not all that many external controls, the button placement is very good. The power switch, like most consumer DSLRs, is located in a ring around the shutter button. This is the same spot as the zoom toggle on my old megazoom, so sometimes I will instinctively flip the switch and end up turning the camera off.Performance overall seemed very good. All the buttons are nicely responsive, burst shooting is great with a good memory card (though the buffer fills a little fast), and the camera is ready to shoot practically instantly after I flip the power switch.The provided 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 kit lens is usually sharp enough, and the zoom barrel turns smoothly. However, unless I stop down to f8, the corners can be noticeably soft. This isn't a real bad problem, but may be if you need sharp corners on your kit lens. The bokeh on the 18-55 lens is very nice.Low light shooting was a key factor in my decision to purchase this camera, and it did not disappoint. There is a good deal of luminance noise (\"grain\") in high ISO JPEG shots, but not much color noise and good detail retention.In the limited testing I was able to get done in movie mode, I was pleasantly surprised by the picture quality of the HD video, but audio could be better. Also AF during video is very slow and the noise is picked up by the mic.Dynamic range was a bit of a double-edged sword for me- excellent shadow range, but highlight range was a little disappointing. RAW headroom is limited. However, activating Highlight Priority will give you an extra stop of highlight range without much cost in performance or added noise, so this may not be much of an issue.The exposure metering was usually pretty good, but the multi metering was a bit inconsistent-producing a washed out shot, then a shot that required +3 stops of post-capture exposure compensation. Center-weighted average worked better for me, especially doing macro shots.Overall this DSLR is not perfect, nor as good as models a price class up, but will give you great low light quality and good performance in an inexpensive bundle.

For some reason, Auto-ISO is not available in M mode.TAv mode is one of those features that if you've used it before you most likely fell in love with, but if you skipped it you'll never notice it's gone. Basically, you get to set the shutter speed and aperture, and the camera uses the ISO (sensitivity) to correct the exposure.So why is it absent? IMHO on the K-x the TAv mode is excluded in favor of including the Scene Mode, which presumably appeals to the point and shoot crowd trying to transition to dSLR. Plus, Pentax still offers TAv mode on the more expensive K-7 and K-5.Would I have bought the K-x if I'd known TAv mode was absent? Maybe. I'm a big fan of TAv mode, and found myself using it alot. So much so that my first thought when I saw the specs for the K-x with a 12800 ISO sensitivity was how great it would be to have all that additional range in TAv. I find TAv mode so useful, I thought it was a no-brainer that it would be included. I didn't even look. And besides, the K-x has all those cool features....My recommendation is that if you are starting out in dSLR that you cut the safety net of Scene mode completely. Pick up a used K10D and learn about photography. Once you understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture, and sensitivty try TAv mode. You'll be floored by how much creative control it gives you. And don't worry: the K10D has a \"Green\" mode that takes great pictures anytime you want a break. As a bonus the K10D also throws in weather-proofing -- so you'll be able to hone your skills in just about any circumstance.On the other hand, pick the K-x if you are drawn by the improved sensor/sensitivty/features and can live without the weather-proofing. The K-x is a remarkable camera, especially for the price. And plenty of famous photographers have done brilliant work without TAv mode, so how useful can it really be?", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm not a professional photographer!", "Author": "Kandelina \"Fantismo Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3OWA4KJTYLI61", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the title says, I'm not a professional photographer by any means but I did do my research on what camera I wanted to buy and an online Digital Photography school aided in my decision.

Sure, some things could be improved, like the focus speed, but it's just all awesome.PROSThe K-x has terrific image quality compared to other DSLRs, and certainly compared to compact cameras. The viewfinder is bright and large, and there are many features to discover. For example, 720p HD video with cool depth of field effects. I picked this up for around 460 dollars. WITH THE LENS! Terrific value. It has in-body image stabilization, but it doesn't seem to work as well as optical lens based stabilization. There are all the great manual modes, but Pentax also includes a handy sensitivity priority mode, where you pick the ISO, and the camera chooses the aperture and the shutter speed. Great lens. The sharpness is wow! Also, the in camera editing is actually handy and is useful if you do not have access to a computer for a while. I find the use of AA batteries a huge plus also. I can pick up batteries cheaply anywhere in the world. Great handling also, the buttons are extremely easy to memorize and it is easy to master controlling the camera.CONSThe focus speed is really fast in good light, but in low light, it can be a bit tricky to focus, but still really fast, just not lightning fast. In live mode, like almost every other DSLR, the AF is very slow, unless you use the quick mode AF, which is slightly faster. That's pretty much it.If you need a DSLR, GO BUY THE K-X NOW!

When I researched about that camera, I thought I may have to go for K-7 instead of K20D. After losing 800EUR on ebay in purchasing a new K-7, I took some time to re-evaluate if I really need to spend some more money on the camera. After 3 months I found it's very difficult without a DSLR. Ok, then which one?I went to a camera shop and hand held some of the DSLRs from Canon and Nikon. All are wonderful cameras but they are bigger for my small hands. Then I found this little camera, which also uses 4xAA batteries as my Fuji. I found the features and the reviews about this little beast very interesting. No second thought, I bought it, this time from PhotoPlanet in Stuttgart.

I also wish they fix the video \"metal\" noise issue, with that, video is almost useless. But video should be left with camcorder anyway.

It woke up my sleeping child when I took a few pictures. My 2nd half did not like it... Is this normal for this type of bigger camera or do I have a defective unit ? It also makes noise when I change setting or turn the dial. This is my first digital camera with detachable lens. I used Canon SX20is, Fujifilm HS10 and other compact cameras and they are much quiet.

The spec shows the same senor size, same pixel counts and added new features. It uses same processor but a review said it is faster in performance. I wish Pentax has newer firmware to make K-x faster too.

Buying a camera really has a lot to do with knowing what you want and need, and for me I needed full manual control (f-stop, shutter speed, color balance, RAW, etc), good low light, and swappable lenses, at as low a price as possible without entering knock-off territory.

Not the best camera for IR, of course, but not as bad as some people online say.* The noise, which is pretty rare, is great.

It lifts the mirror and then time s l o w s  t o  a  c r a w l.  There is a BLUR/Smear that happens whenever you take a photo in moderate to low light. This IS a documented problem with this camera. It makes hands, clothing or anything that is not in the direct fire of the flash blurry and a deal-breaker for me. Every camera has it's weaknesses but this is unacceptable!

The Pentax people (VERY knowledgeable and accommodating) told me the camera was defective and to either send it to them or return it to the place of purchase for exchange (it is one week old).  My final verdict awaits my second K-x.  It has caused me to wonder whether I should have gone with the XSi.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could not pull a sharp image", "Author": "GGPM \"GGPM\"", "ReviewID": "R20HMQRHWQALHQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I worked long and hard with this camera over a month. Sometimes I could get the results I wanted, but most often the level of detail I expected when zoomed in on my image was just plain fuzzy.

But disappointed to find it had NO SD card.  Not even a .5GB throwaway.  Kind of takes the joy out of getting a new toy.  I'd like to review the camera, but now I have to wait until I can get a card.Also, the small end of the USB cable is non-standard (I really hate that.)  So, I would recommend a card reader as well - misplace the cable and you are SOL.Finally, to continue ranting a bit, the camera does not come with rechargeable batteries.  It ships with four lithium AAs.  It's not clear, from my brief research, that the camera works well with rechargeables.  The lithiums are expensive, and certainly not very green.Overall impressions of the camera are good - it's light, compared with a full-size DSLR, but still feels fairly study.  The overall organization is fairly straight-forward and the menu system is simple, at least compared to the Nikon D-300 I've been using.I'll update once I can actually take some pictures.
