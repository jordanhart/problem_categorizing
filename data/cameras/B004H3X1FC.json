{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Arrived defective", "Author": "Nameless Faceless User", "ReviewID": "R9U0H49D758B4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was in the process of upgrading my previous 12mp Casio Exilim to this model.  Wow, what happened?  I charged the battery and ran through all the features.  My older model has a USB dock.  To charge the camera and copy the photos off, all I needed to do was dock the camera and press a button.  The camera appeared as a drive on my Mac.  The new model does not have a dock but rather a more conventional small connector on the side.  Ok, I can live without the dock.  But, the connector is not a mini-USB; I need a special cable to plug into the camera then plug that into the USB.  This was cumbersome and disappointing.This camera adds panoramic stitching.  Just hold the shutter open and sweep in a circle.  Even without a tripod I created a super wide view image easily.  The downside was it was only 720 pixels high i.e. video quality, not picture quality.  Disappointing.The white balance worked great as did the macro focus.  I easily created a movie and audio recording.  I was happy with it and ready to sell my old camera so I pulled up the images on my computer.  I noticed that every image was blurry.  I tried again with the flash on, thinking it was only the hand held ambient light photos I had problems with.  Even the flash photos were all blurry.There must have been something wrong with the electronic shutter.  Although the pictures looked \"ok\" on the LCD they were blurry when I took a good look at them.  The details were smeared together, making the macro focus images look like cartoons.  The seller was excellent and took care of the problem promptly.Casio is not the first name you think of when you think of electronic cameras.  I had thought the Exilim series was a hidden gem, offering more \"bang for the buck\" over offerings from Pentax, Nikon, Fuji, and Olympus.  But I see their quality control might have something lacking, especially in this price range.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Business or Fun", "Author": "Richard Gray \"Islands\"", "ReviewID": "RMRQ0NK93ZBZ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use my Casio H-30 daily for my business.  The date stamp is crucial for documentation.  Easy to use, crystal clear photos, long battery life.  Less expensive than my H-20.  Would have paid more.  Fits in a shirt pocket.  Long battery life. Will buy another one, until the next model comes out.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004H3X1FC"}}
