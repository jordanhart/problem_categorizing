{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's actually a good camera!", "Author": "Real Raleigh Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1L3JGQDH1ZZR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In this low-to-medium-end point-and-shoot category you will find pretty hit-and-miss performance. Take for example my recent scathing review of the Nikon Coolpix S3100 - which we purchased and have returned because the performance (speed, focus, etc.) is so abysmally bad that it can't be a real product, it must be defective. Even simple pictures of stationary subjects at 10 feet in broad daylight come out blurry, and the semi-focused pics come out grainy. Absolute junk.By contrast is this nice little device, which we purchased on Amazon at the same time. It has a 3\" touchscreen with menus that are easy to use, with very simple and intuitive menus and controls. This is a feature typically only found on slightly higher-end point and shoot cameras, in the $200+ range. It's small and sleek, and while the Nikon has a nice metal body (or at least, the front half), this one has a little bit of a lighter, cheaper, all-plastic body - it feels well-made but it's very very light. Now for the real important thing: does it take good pictures?Yes.Its flash actually lights the scene well and the sensor appears to tick down the sensitivity a little when the flash is in use; the result is that it does a pretty good job with flash photography. However, it seems to take pretty clear, focused pictures even under incandescent light. Sometimes the auto-focus gets a little confused in low light, so it's not 100% perfect, but I've never had a camera that is. About 90-95% of the indoors photos came out clearly, which is quite remarkable for such a small and inexpensive camera.To be perfectly fair and objective, I took this camera and our Nikon Coolpix S3100 (since returned to Amazon) outside and took two shots per camera, of each of five subjects, in the same resolution, at the same time, using the 'auto' mode. I chose the sharper of the two photos from each camera and renamed the file generically. I then brought up the photos on our 1080p 55\" TV - the largest-format, highest-resolution screen in the house. I showed them to my wife and asked her to choose \"before\" and \"after\", letting her know that I had swapped the order of the pictures randomly (so that A wasn't always the Nikon, B wasn't always the Samsung). In 5 out of 5 cases, she picked (and I agreed) the Samsung's pictures, simply on the focus, color precision and depth of field. The Nikon just can't focus correctly. For example, on the back patio, the kids' tricycle is relatively focused, but the grill right beside it - both near the center of the shot - is entirely blurred out. On the Samsung, both are, as expected, in perfect focus.You can go wrong in the entry-level point-and-shoot category but not with this little guy - it works splendidly, it's budget-friendly, and it has features and some performance that's comparable to other point-and-shoot offerings at twice the price. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the Price", "Author": "vana conspiciunt \"None\"", "ReviewID": "R388ICT60LBOM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is great for the price! The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. The resolution is amazing for the size, and even the motion shots turn out ok. My only complaint is the zoom; it does not focus well, it really doesn't zoom very far, and really, if you want to zoom in on anything, your better off just walking closer to whatever your trying to capture. The video features are excellent, and i just used it at a horse show where it took excellent videos and action shots (very little blurring). All in all i think its a great camera for the price", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Dave K in Tucson \"VicinTucson\"", "ReviewID": "R1XZ1HHI23W6Q6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for a cheap replacement for an old Kodak Point and shoot who's battery door failed.

Nelson \"Consumer Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R24Q3VKO7GC5KH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a compact camera the Samsung ST95 also packs a punch. It's probably the perfect travel camera as it doesn't skimp on quality or portability.Pros-Very good Macro shots-Some of the filters (vignetting and miniature mode are effective when used properly-Size (pocketable)-Battery life: For a camera with a huge LCD the battery is lasting a long while and can be easily rechargedCons-No viewfinder (what'ya gonna do, they're being phased out)-Sometimes shots come out blurry if you don't time them right. For instance, when you depress the shutter button half way you see the subject coming into clarity and then going blurry again before the shot is taken.-No room for add-onsOverall this camera performs very well. I did a lot of research before settling on this and I'm glad I did so far. Time will tell if this thing continues to perform as it does. I noticed that shooting in \"simple shot\" mode is often best for matching the brightness and color levels you want. Switch the shooting mode to 10Megapixels and under to save room, I never shoot in 16 megapixel mode, there's no need to.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "easy to use", "Author": "jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3EYKNEL2T3S5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is easy to use right out of the box.
