The picture quality is wonderful and the camera is so well made. When you are holding it in your hand you can feel that Sony construction quality that puts everything American made to shame. The picture quality is very good, and even if you visibly \"move\" the camera while taking a photo, it still does not come out blurry - hence the \"steady shot\" moniker that the camera is named for. And I didn't notice any excessively long delay when I hit the button until the time the camera took the photo. The camera is really a very easy to use point and shoot camera. And the layout/design make it easy to quickly learn what each button's function is. I had a nice Fuji Film (2004) camera that I was looking to upgrade, and I've been very happy with this Sony product.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber-shot S-930", "Author": "crusingtortoo", "ReviewID": "RCLLURU7NKJDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought as replacement camera for my husband.

We were advised that the camera was within warranty and sent the camera in, only to learn that it was actually out of warranty and that they wanted far more than the original cost of the camera to repair it.  Apparently, it was a refurb unit with only a 90 day warranty (we did not send the camera in right away because we had been told it was a 1 year warranty).  We have evidence that the camera was not working in June (well within the warranty period), but Sony would not budge.  We wasted our valuable time and money sending the camera in to the repair center only to learn that we had been advised incorrectly by Sony.  We are deeply disappointed with Sony's quality and customer service.  We simply refuse to buy Sony again based upon this experience.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber Shot", "Author": "James W.

I've owned it for a little over a year now. Take this from me (and from other reviewers), the battery life is ridiculously short. I put in brand new Sony-branded batteries this month and couldn't even use the camera beyond 20 pictures at a friend's party. After that, it started to shut off when the flash light was engaged. This, of course, was not an isolated experience. This camera has been doing this to me for a while. I myself contacted Sony and the rep said that the device might need servicing. Price tag (since mine is out of warranty): $107, which is more than what I paid for. Furthermore, picture quality is not the best. Some smartphone cameras do a better job. Anybody who reads my reviews on here know I'm loyal to Sony. But I'm always fair in my reviews. Therefore, I recommend to anyone shopping for a point and shoot device not to buy this specific product. If you're a Sony fan, I would look for a better model. I will make sure my next camera doesn't take AA batteries but instead can be charged via power. If you don't care about the Sony brand, I definitely would look elsewhere. There are other manufacturers who make better products in the same class.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "my mistake", "Author": "Duncan L. MacFarlane \"dmacfar139\"", "ReviewID": "RT0FBMJKLRKYK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an archaic camera and probably should be discontinued by Sony because its performance reflects poorly on a good company. Tempted by the price (~$100) i purchased it as a replacement for another Sony model. My biggest problem with the camera is that the screen was so dim that it was worthless outdoors -- even on cloudy days. Fragile too, it's already broken, the lens jammed somehow in my padded knapsack. I'll take the blame here for buying a product that wasn't a match for what i needed.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, UNTIL it stopped working...", "Author": "Alison \"Picture this\"", "ReviewID": "R9HB1YKL6COZL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was a great camera when I bought it as a refurb at a Sony Outlet store in March 2010.  It took wonderful pictures.  It was only 39.99.  It cost me the same to go and purchase an 8g memory stick.  I was very happy.  What was nice was that it was so easy to use, it was small and took great pictures.  I used it during the summer.  Nice deal.Anyway, I started having some problems with it in September 2010.  I was unable to access some of the pictures when I pressed the back key.  When I viewed the pictures on a PC, they were fine.  I assumed that it might have to do with some of the cropping and editing that I did, but I know I didn't do it on all the pictures.Anyway, next, the battery died after shooting only 10 flash exposures.  That was strange.  I just chalked it up to needing fresh batteries, although I had just changed the set.I was able to get a few shots on the camera around December 2010.  I put new batteries in it, as the ones I put in September corroded.  That was quick.  Took it to a New Year's party.  It was that night when it chose to go, and of course, there were opportunities to embarrass friends with pictures of them behaving stupid for future reference.  I tried putting new batteries in it.  No luck.  No power, nothing.  It's dead, Jim.Well, it was fun while it lasted...", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.95", "Features": "Digital camera", "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot\u00ae DSC-S930 10-MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, 2.4\" LCD, Image Stabilization, Face Detection (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YGj%2BDzLmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0026JMFY2"}}
