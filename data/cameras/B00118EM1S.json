{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Monitor Screen", "Author": "Scotsman", "ReviewID": "R259TTBD2J8TY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I now have 2 of these screens in use as on-podium monitor screens (I built an adjustable framework to hold the screen) taking feeds from Laptop or Video sources.  This allows the speaker to see what is on the screen(s) behind him/her without having to crane their neck to see it.  We also use it as a form of teleprompter to send a pre-written speech, so notes are not necessary.  I  have run these off both power supply and battery pack without problems.  Because they are not attached to the podiums, they do get bumped around a bit, but still work great.  If you need a good inexpensive screen, this is a great selection. Note:  It can work as a testing monitor for video signals as well.  This is helpful when you can't see the destination screen.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little security monitor", "Author": "M.

The issue is WIRELESS has static, and as soon as there is static, the screen goes blue.  There is no way to stop the BLUE SCREEN you just have to deal with it - in my case spend $40 on gas today to buy a $35 part that still hasn't fixed it for me.Other than that, the screen is gorgeous, it comes with TWO remotes.. one is wired, the other is wireless.  Mine came with a BNC, Composite and VGA connector.  The Bezel it comes with is a solid piece of plastic, I thought it was just a frame, it's not so that's going to make it more difficult to \"easily paint.\"Great quality picture, very bright, and other than the bluescreen issue I'm very happy with it!

Luckily, the product had a \"VGA\" output port, so I looked around for something inexpensive to use as the primary display.  Due to space limitations, I didn't want something as large as a standard 20\" monitor.  I was able to find some 12\" monitors but they seemed to target point of sale applications and were pretty expensive.I also saw a number of specialized video displays that did not seem to offer VGA compatibility.  I ran across the PYLE on Amazon, which was a good size and had the same aspect ratio as the original display.  I was a bit put off by the price, but purchased it anyway.Basically installation was plug and play.  I already had a 12V power supply, so connected that up and plugged in a VGA cable and everything worked.Some complaints:1)  I read the documentation before purchase and could not determine many details of operation.  For example:  do you have to do setup every time you turn it on?  Often things that aren't spelled out aren't there.  Fortunately, setup with the Pyle was easy and it does remember everything.2)  It is not the easiest thing to mount.  More mounting options (brackets and or holes) would be a help.  I only remember four mounting holes.3)  It wasn't clear before purchase, but all of the input cables and the remote control cable are hardwired to the circuit board.  On something as expensive as this you would expect connectors so unnecessary cables could be easily removed.  I currently have all the unneeded cables strapped to the back of the display - an unsightly mess.In summary the PYLE did exactly what I wanted, but I can't speak about the color fidelity, crispness or other aspects of video quality.  I think it is a bit overpriced, but this isn't a mass-market item, so some additional cost is expected.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "No power adapter", "Author": "Andy k.
