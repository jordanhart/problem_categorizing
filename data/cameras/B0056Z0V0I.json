The 16 MP resolution gives outstanding clarity and tone, plus you can crop if needed and still have enough left for a decent shot. While is does not have all the extras (aperture/shutter priority, manual, etc.) it DOES have what I consider essential controls: +/- exposure compensation and ISO to 1600.  These are found by going to \"scenes\" and selection \"program.\" Then you can access them via onscreen display.Otherwise, choices are limited, but that's what a lot of people want.  You will want to get an external card reader, as it the camera is pretty locked in to the EasyShare system and I could not get a PC to \"see\" the camera when the software was not installed. However, with it installed you can send to Facebook, etc.It also can emulate the look of some older Kodak films such as Kodachrome and Tri-X.  This is fun for some old schoolers who miss the look of film.  A lot of good stuff for the money.This camera will NOT be good for far-away nature shots and indoor sports action shots. That requires higher end gear.  But for the casual and street photographer, it's pretty amazing and about as simplified as they currently get.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good camera", "Author": "Taz", "ReviewID": "R26TBXDHYK254V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compact size makes for easy carrying,takes very good pictures.Battery lasts a long time and with a 16gb card taking pictures all weekend is no problem.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactlly What I Wanted", "Author": "ABF89", "ReviewID": "R2Q2RC617JELEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything that I expected it to and more.

I wanted a piece of Kodak history and I decided on the red camera, it's more of a metallic orange than red; I haven't seen many cameras this color but it looks great.I'm surprised by the substantial build quality of the camera.  It's heavier than I thought it would be for it being so small, and even though I'm sure it's plastic, it feels almost like aluminum. This Kodak has a robust feel to it that most cameras this price don't have.The battery/SD card door has a heavy-duty spring and it doesn't look like it will break unless you are extremely rough with your camera.  You can charge the lithium-ion battery inside the camera via the AC plug/power supply or by USB connection on your computer.The LCD screen is easy to see, even in daylight, the menus are very simple and easy to navigate, and I like the dedicated movie button on top of the camera, which eliminates having to dig down into the menus when capturing a video.  A printed manual comes with the camera, but the EasyShare software is stored inside the camera (which I don't care for but I work around it by using a card reader).There is no dedicated macro button, it's buried in a menu under the scenes, and then you choose \"close-ups\". I was surprised again at what good close-ups I can get with this camera, and it blurs the background like a much more expensive camera would do.Takes very good pictures and 720 HD movies, but the optical zoom will not work during a video.  Of course you can't expect optical zoom for a movie on a camera as cheap as this one. So for those of you reading this that want to know if you can optically zoom, well, no, you cannot - if you want optical zoom, you will have to zoom before you press the shutter button or physically move closer to the subject if possible.The zoom motor sounds strong, not like it may give out on me a month or so from now.This is an inexpensive camera I plan on carrying in my bag and if it breaks, so what? Yes, I know Kodak is getting out of the digital camera business but they are supporting the warranty for this camera for a year.  If you fear lack of support, you can always get a cheap warranty from Square Trade.  As much as I switch up my cameras from time-to-time, a one-year warranty is fine for me.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Appearance isn't enough", "Author": "Jazzydivagrrl", "ReviewID": "R3G4ENPKUGF80S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace my Kodak Easyshare V1233 which I absolutely love. (It is having issues.) I expected this newer model to offer higher quality with more bells and whistles. The specific swaying review stated \"you can't take a blurry picture.\" How incredibly wrong. I have an entire birthday party of blurred photos. (Were there an option to post them...)Pros:Posed, still shots look great, but required patience.Sleek, snazzy look and feel.Excellent video - sound and picture quality.Cons:Lots of blurred shots. Unable to capture any moving moments clearly.Delay in focus, even after I changed the auto focus.Delay in shutter speed meant lots moments/shots.Shutter stuck. More lost shots.\"Smart capture\" color is BRILLIANT! (Meaning very bright, garish)Slow \"processing\" caused even greater delays in shooting.Before I returned the camera, I changed the SD card to a faster speed, adjusted the scene settings, opted for custom on each occasion, began limiting use to only still photos.

Even my $450 Canon G11 had problems with pictures bending in the middle on close ups(known as pin cushioning).  Which is a sign of a cheap lens or bad software that doesn't correct internally, so the user never knows anyting different.  It also takes great low light pictures, but as usual, you need to hold still or it will be blurry.  Also, at 16MP, you can really blow up the picture to 13 x 19 size and it looks just as good as a 4 x 6.

I use it to take outdoor scenic pictures and close ups for my ebay store.  Both worked out beautifully!  A plesant surprise: it works very well in low light conditions like stage shows and indoors.  In those conditions it can get a little blurry if you do not rest your hand and wrist somewhere--but again, low light should be blamed not the camera.  The pictures are awesome as long as you give your hands stable support.  It let you choose \"bright\" for conditions like the beach, and \"close ups\" for my ebay pictures, all with easy to use buttons.  Only flaw is the \"easy share\" software on my computer: it shows up every time I put the SD card in the computer card slot.  I prefer manu sharing rather than Kodak's quick sharing, so the software seem a little pesky.  Other than that I just love, love, love this camera--it has everything my Canon has and so much more.

I am no photographer, in fact this is the first camera I ever purchased for myself. I just wanted a camera which would take nice pictures of my friends, family and from hikes and at the same time didn't require me to learn anything about settings. It turns out this item is perfect for my needs. There are several modes to choose from, when you highlight one, a short note appears which tells you when the mode is appropriate. I find it very convenient. I took this camera to a hike in a forest on a very cloudy day and got really nice pictures of both landscape and some close-ups of flowers. I think people who complained about blurry pictures did not change the mode to the appropriate one (e.g. without setting my camera to \"close-up\" while photographing tiny flowers I also got blurry pics). Just to test the camera I took some picture of one compound I synthesized in my research project. I was very surprised that the pictures not only turned out very well, regardless of very bad artificial light in the lab, but also revealed tiny crystals formed in the beaker, which were not visible with a naked eye (again, I used the close-up mode).I also like a lot the case the camera came with, it's very practical.I strongly recommend this camera to anyone who needs user friendly but still a good one.

Admittedly I had one that I could not see the screen anytime I was outdoors. Recently I was in the desert (i.e.bright sun) with this camera and could ALWAYS see what I was taking a picture of. Clear, beautiful pictures combined with the ease up uploading to Kodak Gallery etc with one click make it the perfect camera in my mind. I also love the placement of all the buttons better than any camera I have previously owned.

Kodak cameras seem to last longer than any other camera and has everything I was looking for. The pictures are crisp and clear, easy to charge battery, is user friendly very light weight and compact. It is an every day use camera. I was surprised at how small it was but the advantage to that is it will go anywhere easily. We have recently added four of these to our family. I ordered one for my husband for Christmas. My son also received one from his Grandmother. They love it! After seeing how wonderful it takes pictures my daughter-n-law ordered one for herself in January. I received the best price, at $64, as I just ordered a red one for myself!
