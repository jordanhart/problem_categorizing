{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Avoid this camera", "Author": "Tama Para", "ReviewID": "R3C92HKARFG0TD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually don't give bad reviews, but this cheap camera isn't worth any price. More of a toy than an actual digital camera, and not even nice enough to resell in a garage sale. The camera feels cheap, it doesn't have flash, (which maybe I should have noticed prior to purchase) so you can't take pix in low lighting. The camera doesn't signal to the user that a picture has been snapped, though the owner's manual says it will beep, ours never did or it was so inaudible we couldn't hear it. There isn't even a satisfying click or noise or anything, so maybe we bought a defective model. The photo's are grainy - I am very dissatisfied with the purchase of this camera. Save your money. (Ours was bought on a weekend getaway since we forgot our real camera. Should have bought a disposable over this.)", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$24.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Digital Concepts 98377 Digital Camera - Digital camera - compact - 0.3 Mpix - red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LrLrG5kOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00191SDS0"}}
