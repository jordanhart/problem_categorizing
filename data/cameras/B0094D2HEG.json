I have had it out in all kinds of nasty weather, hunting and fishing, with great results. It records in up to  1080 HD for great video footage. It has a lot of adjust ability for different conditions and activities. The 1 to 9 still frame, and 3 different mega pixel settings, are great for different filming and picture situations. I have never completely submerged it yet, as I am waiting to get the full waterproof housing, for some great underwater fishing footage. This camera puts out great 1080HD video ,with crisp  sharpness  ,and really good audio, even in extreme weather,high wind,heavy rain, etc. I love the mounting brackets ,especially the double swivel one ,so I can mount it  in many different places, on many different spots, fishing rods ,helmets ,gun,etc,for that one great action shot, I am looking for. I also like that it uses 3 AAA batteries for quick changes,in the field, on the fly. The soft buttons for camera controls work great. I give this video camera my highest rating ,for quality video and audio, great ease of use , even for an electronically  challenged person like me.  Pros// Great looking 1080HD video,and great sounding audio.  Lots of different mounting brackets available as accessories.  Low battery indicator. Nano Waterproof coating ,for use in  all weather conditions. Great different assortment of recording or picture settings ,that are easy to change to.  Cons// Hard to fine any ,except it filmed me losing a Monster fish, in Alaska ,that I still think about every day. I hope this review is informative and entertaining . {FISHGRILLER APPROVED }", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R2723SZ3S72SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is of excellent quality and works great. The video quality is HD and with all the included mounts, can be utilized pretty much anywhere.

I've captured some entertaining moments as well.  The mounts (one stand type, two strap types, and one sticky type with a multiple angle widget) make putting this in many places fun and allows one to use imagination in camera set-up.  I've even placed it under the truck and it was like watching an action movie where the camera was the stunt person!  The picture, in enclosed spaces, can tend to make images seem \"rounded\", though in wide open areas, you shouldn't notice.I am slightly disappointed, the reason I gave it only four stars, in the sound quality.  If you are less than one foot from the camera, the sound capture seems splendid.  If you are approximately 2 to 3 feet from the camera, you have to speak loudly, close to a yell, in order for the camera to pick up your speech.  Greater than that, and you better learn to read lips.  However, this also helps reduce noise due to wind.  I will also say, when I placed it under the truck, the exhaust system is rather loud, so the camera did pick up the sound, but instead of a clean exhaust sound, it was garbled with static.  I realize these are rough punishments, but I expected the sound pick up to perform at least as well as a standard cheap microphone.Other than that, I have had so much fun with this thing.  I think the main take-a-way is to use this camera in environments that are potentially too dangerous or too cumbersome for an expensive handheld.  Just be aware that you may sacrifice sound quality for camera safety or more handiness in situations that demand both hands!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Amber Cole", "ReviewID": "R3TCQHAKPMF6H9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is exactly what I wanted for my husband.
