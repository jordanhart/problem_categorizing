{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb Camera!", "Author": "John McQuitty", "ReviewID": "R100L3VAB9VN02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to get on the bandwagon here.  This is a superb little camera, definately five stars!  I also have the TZ1, which showed promise, but has  limitations. In my review of the TZ1, I noted it had lots of \"noise\" and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp.  I also wanted more manual controls.The TZ3 fixes and improves almost everything about the TZ1 and adds some new, very useful features.  The noise has been drastically reduced, the lens is better, the sensor is bigger, and the processor is not only faster, but produces better pictures.  The TZ3 adds a very handy \"function\" button - or I should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so \"most used\" settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several.The TZ3 keeps the Mega Optical Image Stabilization and adds Intelligent ISO, increases the sensitivity without adding noise,(I have not tried the 3200 setting yet.), increases the size of the viewing screen, etc., etc.The TZ3 is a \"well-rounded,\" and very capable camera.  There is simply no comparison between the TZ1 and the TZ3 as far as the quality of the pictures.  The TZ3 wins hands down.  In my opinion it also beats some big name, higher priced digicams - a couple of which I own - rather handily.Of course, the big selling point for the TZ3 is still the 10X lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera.  This lens is SHARP, and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results.While there are no manual controls, per se, the camera seems to do very well without them.  Pictures are sharp, exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet, but low light forrest shots were excellent), colors were accurate, appropriately saturated, and vivid (OK.  I like the vivid setting.), good contrast, etc.  There are a variety of AF settings, settable focal points, and focus modes.  There is also exposure compensation, and exposure bracketing available - and they work well!  The live histogram is a welcome bonus.  The TZ3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent, sharp results.  The TZ3 is very well speced out.One nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the TZ1.  It was  really not to inconvenient, but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake.  The TZ3 lens includes an built in lens cover.  Very welcome.I currently own five top flight digicams (including this one), and have owned about that many others, I am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results.  It is a quantum step forward.I also have a couple of quite nice, and fairly complete DSLR kits.  They are wonderful, and in a class by themselves, but when I want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10X, wide angle lens, or a back up for the DSLRs, the TZ3 is now my camera of choice.", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent (from a pro photojournalist)", "Author": "FrontPage", "ReviewID": "R24A0ESBB64943", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start with my credentials: I've been working for a major daily newspaper for 23 years. I've won various photo contests, from local and regional contests, to national and international contests such as NPPA, POY, as well as the National Baseball Hall of Fame (several times). I've literally traveled around the globe, covering news features and sports. So, please allow me to lend my own feedback on this camera, which I have owned for several months now. I've also started actively shooting with camcorders such as the Panasonic AG-HVX200 high-definition camcorder, and the Sony DCR-SR30 camcorder.I'm a proud TZ3 owner (purchasing it with my own funds), and I've been using Lumix cameras since I was issued a DMC-FZ20, at my request. (That camera taught me about versatility when I went to the Superdome and the Convention Center to cover the plight of the survivors of Hurricane Katrina, who struggled to survive the elements following the storm). I've also used the FZ30, and also own a TZ1, the older and less-impressive sibling to the TZ3. And I'd pick this camera, over even the Nikon D2Xs and D2Hs cameras, if I had only one camera to pack in order to cover any breaking news story as of the date of this writing. Why? Because the Lumix line of \"bridge\" cameras are the most versatile and quick-performing that I've experienced to date. With the pro SLRs, I'd need to carry lenses from a 17-35mm, 80-200mm, and 300mm lenses, to shoot images while all that glass is wrapped into the neat package of the TZ3. Yet the Nikons I own don't shoot video. The Sony camcorder shoots only 3 still images per recording session, which don't match the image quality of the TZ3. And the HVX200 is too bulky.The TZ3 is a great run-and-gun camera. At a heartbeat, I can switch over to video and shoot some decent footage at widescreen mode (my preference), which is widescreen, at 848 x 480 (better than most hybrid cameras, which tend to shoot only in 640x480. The TZ3 is such a low-profile camera that you can shoot very candid stills and video when you want to capture people at their most human moments.The body is so compact, I can do 3 very vital and exciting things: place it into tight spaces, shoot without attracting unwanted attention, and mount the camera on unusual items (most recently, a bass drum belonging to a high school student in a marching band, and it recorded video during the band's practice). I've also clamped it onto a wheel barrow and also placed it among stocked food in the refrigerator section. That yields such wide ranging perspectives that could hardly be accomplished with many other cameras and camcorders.I like keeping the ISO setting at the minimum of ISO 100 or 200, for the digital noise can yell loudly at higher ISO settings. Most recently, I shot a gorgeous image of a moody scene at midnight, with street lamps and the moon being the only light sources on a fog-filled street.Some drawbacks: I'm not satisfied with the way the camera captures images at the default setting because they seem too washed out. So I set the camera at 2/3rds stop under-exposure. It adds better tonal quality. And the audio quality lacks for the video. I wash the sound in some audio software to crank up the treble, and add some bass. It takes more time, but it helps bring back the muffled sound that gets recorded through a single hole on top of the camera.The TZ3 is so compact that I carry it with me almost everywhere at work and wherever I go, because in a heartbeat, something could happen. If so, I'd be prepared to document whatever happens. Think about it: on my days off, I'd NEVER carry my Nikon pro bodies. And so this is great for sticking in your pocket for day trips, extended vacations, or a family gathering. If you can just remember that you can capture a moment, just pull the TZ3 out, and within about 5 seconds, you can record what could be some cherished memories.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Panasonic has a winner here", "Author": "D. Hentze", "ReviewID": "R1A1JGT35ZE17H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic has taken the original TZ1 and made it even better. There's not much missing from this camera. 28mm wide angle lens. 10X optical zoom. 3\" high resolution screen, excellent Image Stabilization, etc. All this in a fairly compact camera. Panasonic has also improved the \"noise\" on higher ISO's. Low light performance is better than on previous Panasonic models. The most important this is, the camera takes great pictures. Panasonic did take one step back in video mode on the TZ3. Unlike on the TZ1, you can not \"zoom\" while taking video. You can zoom before you start taking the video. This doesn't bother me, but some people find it important. Overall, this is the best compact camera I've ever owned.Edit 01/30/2008: Just a note. The TZ4 and TZ5 will be out within the next 2-3 months!", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Zoom and Easy to Use", "Author": "Haig", "ReviewID": "R2QRTDJ1QOTUCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent weeks researching cameras and had narrowed my search down to the Canon 800IS, Fujifilm fx31 and this Panasonic Lumix TZ3.  I needed a camera that can give me decent low light photos and good movie capture.  I was skeptical of the panasonic brand at first but their feature set and decent price won me over.  I've been using my TZ3 for a month now and I'm extremely happy with it.Here's an example why...I was in the 30th row at red rocks amphitheatre and was able to zoom in 10x to take close ups of members of the band I was seeing.  No way could I pull that off with a 3x or 4x zoom.  The high sensitivity ISO (3200) does serve a purpose, despite what critics say.  It let me capture these musicians lit up very well in just the stage lights - there is some noise in those shots but its not noticeable in a 4x6 photo.  The Fujifilm has been cited for its excellent low light capabilities but its lack of other features left me unexcited about its overall package.  Now I know most folks don't buy a camera for concert photos but that's what I was looking for and the TZ3 didn't let me down.I also picked up a 4GB memory card and I loved being able to take 30fps movies during our last family vacation.  I'll never lug my videocamera around again.  This baby will film excellent resolution movies for almost 1.5 hours with that memory.The image stabilization seems to work well although I haven't really tested photos without it on.  I just leave it on the second mode which offers more effective stabilization and I don't have to think about it.  I used to get blurry pics once in a while with my old Canon S40 but haven't had a one with this Panasonic.The numerous scene modes are also handy.  Canon offers a handful but Panasonic gives you several more and even offers in-menu descriptions to remind you when to use a particular scene mode.  Better than referring to a owner's manual.  For new parents, the two baby shot modes even let you set up a scene that displays the age of up to 2 children on the picture so  you can track their growth over time.The picture quality has been excellent. You need to learn how to pick the right settings on some lower light or fast moving picture opportunities but for 90% of your shots, the point and shoot quality of the intelligent ISO mode is excellent.The wide angle lens is great.  It gives you more room to compose your shots and I don't know if I could go back to a simple 35mm again.  The Canon 800IS is the only other compact that offers the wide angle.  But Panasonic's 10x zoom sealed the deal for me.  The zoom works quickly and lets you take shots you wouldn't normally take.  You can also record in 3:2 ratio which is conducive to widescreens movie playback as well as 4x6 photo sizes.I've used the included arcsoft software with an older Canon camera but have since migrated to google's picasa and haven't looked back.  The photo-stitch functionality for creating panoramic images from multiple frames was a fun toy for a little while but for 99% of your photos, all you're doing is uploading to a repository, fixing a handful of the really good ones and that's it.  Picasa is extremely simple to accomplish this and a great image management tool.I also like the battery meter on this camera.  I've yet to run out of juice because it tells me when I'm running low and recharge over night for the next day.  Canons don't have a visible battery meter.I could go on further about lots of little features which make this an extremely useful and portable companion.  If you're reading this and am torn between this and something from the Canon line, be assured you won't be sorry with this one.  It simply offers more bang for your buck and you won't be compromising much of anything.  I'm looking forward to years of service from this little marvel.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great second camera for serious photographers", "Author": "Rumbullion", "ReviewID": "R8GEHUDEJ27A4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I normally shoot with a DSLR, but wanted a small camera, with a decent zoom that I could slip in a pocket or put on a belt pouch to carry around with me all the time.  This camera is the only one in the market that fitted my needs, and I am really happy with it. I give it half a star short of the full rating only because of one or two shortcomings.The construction of this camera is solid, which is what one wants, and I don't understand some of the criticism about it being a tad too large or heavy. A 10x lens needs to be wel supported. The fantastic lens is the best thing about this camera.  It is equivalent to a 28mm wide angle which is what I need for landscape shots and some professional uses. The 10x zoom covers a wide range of uses, and as promoted, this makes for a great travel camera. The macro capabilities are also great.  I found battery life to be pretty good, the secret being to switch the camera off when not actally shooting. Some of the critcism about the low light capabilities is correct, but I find the problems associated with this camera to be no worse than other cameras that I have tried. Even my DSLR gives me grief in low light.Negative comments on the image quality in other reviews seem a little exaggerated.  The color rendition in this camera is very natural.  The image processing engine IS too agressive and the images tend to be on the soft side, which is a bit silly when you have this great Leica lens. It's not a problem with small prints but you'll notice it on larger prints on less contrasty subjects.  The information seems to be there, however, as they are easily sharpened up using Photoshop (or even using Preview on my Mac).  Since I post-process all my photos, this is not a problem for me.  I don't shoot video on this camera (that's what Camcorders are for) so I cannot comment on the microphone quality.Drawbacks: I found the lack of a viewfinder to be the major drawback on this camera.  I do not like holding the camera at arms length, even with its impressive shake reduction (although I note that most people like to take pictures this way and do not use their viewfinders.  Even the bright LCD screen washes out in bright sunlight making it difficult to compose a shot.  Note to Panasonic - put a viewfinder in upcoming models. or give the camera a swiveling LCD that is easier to shade. Also put a few more contols of the image processor so that we could sharpen up out pictures a little.This camera isn't perfect, but for its size it has an excellent optical range.  Even for the serious photographer types, it makes a great portable second camera.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does this camera deserve the lens?", "Author": "Noel Hastings \"Emergency Medicine MD\"", "ReviewID": "R23F71EIRXTAXT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Every digital camera seems to have one or two items that need improvement. I have discovered this camera's flaws now. This is an edited version of a previous review now that I have had more time with the camera.I was a pro photographer at one time in my life, before the big transition to digital, so I still look for many pro features now that I have made the transition. As a setting for this review I will note what I own and how I shoot.SHOOTING STYLE: landscapes, travel, macro, still life, documentary style portraiture. (no fast action or sports in general) I don't use a flash if at all possible.CAMERAS I OWN: Canon PowerShot S70 & S80, Kodak P880 & Lumix DMC-TZ3 (in black)OVERALL IMPRESSION: Excellent point & shoot for well lit scenes only. Fabulous lens, great zoom range and professional feeling camera.PROS: Sharp lens (edge to edge & no flare or fringing) great color rendition in well lit scenes, super fast writes to SD, fabulous LCD and great build quality. The image stabilization helps a lot, although not as effective overall as I thought it would be. (This is my first IS camera) The charger and battery are super small and easy to travel with. Just looks nice too!COMPLAINTS: I recently revised them, listed below:1. Poor Firmware & Setting Design (poor low light exposure & metering))2. In low light it not only meters incorrectly, but loses all color saturation and just produces POOR pictures. After sunset, put it away!3. Honestly, just a \"pain\" to shoot with when you want to shoot in anything other than \"idiot\" mode. The lack of any customization forces you to shoot AROUND it's modes, not with them. Not a problem in well lit scenes, but low light forces many adjustments to get a properly exposed image.Overall, the noise from the chip and the Venus III noise reduction is better than I expected, but it is there. With full frame photos you will not really notice it much. The images look sharp, good color realism and not too contrasty. BUT, if you crop in you will notice that some of that low contrast effect is the HEAVY noise reduction and overzealous file compression that result in a loss of a lot of fine detail (mostly in low light settings). (A 1GB card in my Kodak P880 at 7.1M can store 207 images, but in this camera I get 288 images! There must be some heavy handed compression to get images that much smaller on the Lumix and it shows.)The lack of manual controls is maddening. You can't customize the auto settings in any meaningful way either. If you shoot with the standard program mode (red camera) or the auto-iso mode you can't get correct low light exposures!EXAMPLE: I lent my camera to someone and they pointed out the poor metering. I thought they had a setting wrong but they did not. I fiddled with it for an hour and found that even though the camera can calculate the correct exposure, it WILL NOT TAKE IT in a basic simple mode! It bottoms out at a certain shutter speed to try and reduce hand shake. Great, so you get sharper underexposed images! The way around this is to shoot in the \"Night Scenery\" mode, but in this mode you are LOCKED into an ISO of 100. This makes no sense, since it is a \"night\" mode. With that low of an ASA the image stabilization is undermined and you get a better exposure, but now with hand shake! Even with a correct exposure, the noise and colors are so bad the picture looks horrible. Also, a weird glitch is that your shutter speeds beyond 1 second are doubled for some reason. (don't ask me why, but after it takes the picture it whites out the screen and then \"counts-down\" the same number of seconds as the exposure before it lets you take another image!)Overall, this is sad given the AMAZING Leica lens on this camera. As another reviewer said, \"Does this camera really deserve this Leica lens?\" I hope a future Firmware will offer noise reduction, compression settings & lack of customizable options. Until they fix the low light failure of this camera I will limit the use to well lit scenes only, which is a huge handicap.", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Improved Over a Great Performer", "Author": "Robert Salita \"Software Developer\"", "ReviewID": "R2TNEJLL9O65CT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned the first generation DMC-TZ1. The DMC-TZ3 has some welcome improvements; wider angle, automatic lens cover, maybe 25% faster shot-to-shot. In particular, the wider angle is a really useful feature.The camera's strength is in its versatile, daylight shooting. It does best with lots of light. Indoors, the flash coverage is just ok. Shot-to-shot flash recycle time is sometimes a pokey 4 seconds. Digital picture noise is noticeable with lesser light.Setup Tips:1. Use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos.2.

Daniel Endy \"Truth Seeker\"", "ReviewID": "R4L8J3LA7FXT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm very picky. I carry a camera in my pocket at all times.  I've been using a Canon SD400 for 2 years and an SD110 for 4 years before that.  I got tired of waiting for Canon to add more zoom since 3x is not that useful.  Well, the wait is over and I've left Canon.  I wasn't sure but I got a 30-day money-back guarantee so I figured why not.  Trust me it's not going back.This camera has 10x optical zoom plus optical image stabilization.  It has wonderful clarity and lots of controls and scene modes.  Macro and movie modes are very important to me. I like to take macro shots and I've used my camera in place of a video camera for years. The macro mode is great and the movie mode is excellent. I can do a 10x zoom and get great clips.  One issue is you can't zoom while shooting movies.  Canon does let you zoom while shooting movies, but their picture quality goes down hill.Another key for me is size.  I carry a camera in my pocket all the time so size is important.  While the TZ3 is a bit larger than the Canon SD line it still fits nicely.This camera starts with a 28mm wide-angle lens too.  This extends my creative range.  The Leica lens has great clarity too.  The Lithium battery lasts a good long time and the camera has a battery meter so you can see how you are doing.  With my Canon I never knew until the red battery warning light went on.One complaint is that the controls are almost perfect, but not quite.  I am a serious amatuer photographer and I like control.  The camera has a fast setting change mode but one control is missing from that menu - exposure mode.  To go from center-spot exposure, to average, or to center weighted you have to bring up the main settings menu and the setting is buried in the middle.  Oh, well.  Not a huge issue.It has a nice exposure bracket feature that's easy to set when you're not sure what exposure would be best.The 3 inch screen is amazingly clear and the camera has a 'bright' mode which really helps in bright sun.Tips:  I usually shoot at -2/3 (have for a long time) to get more contrast and dynamic range.  I also tend to shoot in 'vivid' mode for more saturation, but I've found that 'natural' mode is pretty good.  Unlike another reviewer who said 'natural' was washed out.I promptly took my new camera on vacation to Costa Rica and took close to 1000 photos and video clips on a 2GB card.  I was very pleased.  What more can I say?  Sorry Canon.  I couldn't wait any longer.  10X rules!(P.S. I also finally decided to fully test Google's Picasa and I must say I like it a lot.  At first it seemed odd, but I got over that.  I no longer have to load up Photoshop to tweak my shots.  I can fix the shadows, fill-flash, and hightlight to get full dynamic range and strong contrast with just a couple clicks.  I can also tweak the color temperature and saturation easily too.  Oh, and how about the 'straighten' tool?  It's incredibly handy and it automatically zooms in to crop off the black edges.  I haven't used photoshop in over a month now.  PLUS you then just select the shots and upload them to Google with no limit on the number of shots or the sizes or any of those annoying limits like on Flickr.  Plus the Google viewer shows the shots at the largest size the viewer's screen can handle.  Plus you can easily zip through the shots with just the left and right arrows.  There are so many reasons to love it. Of course, I would like more.  I wish I could control the page layout for albums and set the background color for an album.  It would also be nice to be able to organize the albums into groups or categories.  I'll bet they add that ability eventually.  You can check out some of my shots on Picasaweb.

As it is, the TZ3 comes really close to being the perfect digital pocket camera.  The lens is the biggest part of the story: 28mm - 280mm (35mm equivalent), a full 10x zoom that doesn't extend more than 2 inches from the body. The 28mm capability makes a huge difference. I just spent the weekend with my sweetheart and five of her sisters. From a few feet away, I could capture the whole group - a substantial change from using the 35mm equivalent focal length of most other cameras. At the telephoto end, the 280mm definitely doesn't have the reach of the 350mm of the TZ1. Too bad one can't have it all. By using a smaller portion of the sensor, you can create higher effective optical zoom extensions, with a commensurate loss of quality, though this is not as bad as with digital zoom.  The 7.2 Megapixel sensor provides adequate image quality.  While there are no explicit manual controls, you can get a great deal of flexibility from using the pre-determined \"scenes\" and the basic controls such as bracketing.  The TZ1 had a physical lens cover which was always a pain to deal with. You had to take it off. It dangled from a string and unless restrained, could wind up in the photograph. The TZ3 has an automatic lens cover: hooray! It also has a 3\" display, which is great to work with. The brightness of the LCD can be adjusted to accomodate bright sunlight (works reasonably well) and unusual viewing angles (works quite well).  The TZ3 is smaller than the TZ1 which is good and bad. It is lighter, which is good. The camera fits neatly into a pocket, which is better than good. The automatic lens cap is wonderful and I suggest a screen protector for the LCD. The ergonomics of the TZ3, however, suffer with the reduction in physical size. The swelling on the right-hand side, which created a nice, hefty handgrip on the TZ1 has been slimmed down in a major way. A little more concious thought is now required when grasping the camera. It is also possible, as this large handed user quickly learned, to inadvertently place a finger in front of the flash.  In terms of responsiveness, the TZ3 seems to power on a little faster than the TZ1, but it still takes time. Shutter lag is reasonably short. But in an ideal world, shutter lag would be non-existent. If that were the case, the TZ3 would indeed be the best camera for street shooting since the Leica M6. The zoom is smooth, if a little slow. Autofocus at lower focal lengths is practically instantaneous in well lit situations and distressingly slow in poor lightings. At longer focal lengths, there does seem to be some hunting.  The battery is rated for approximately 270 shots. You will not appear foolish if you always carry a spare or two. Flash photography appears to quickly drain the battery. Also be careful if you decide to use 4GB SDHC cards: not all built-in laptop card readers will accept them. You may need a USB adapter such as the one supplied with this card: Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card(SDSDB-4096, bulk) & BlueProton USB 2.0 Card Reader Writer (Blue).  Overall, the TZ3 is a great little camera. Even if you have a Nikon or Canon DSLR, you'll find yourself carrying the TZ3 far more often than you might expect. For everyday occasions and ordinary travel photography, this is an almost perfect camera with an extreme zoom, small size, light weight and enough settings to cover most situations. It is not, to be sure, a Nikon or Canon DSLR, but it is more than adequate for most tasks. By the way, video quality (640 x 480 at 30fps) is excellent.

I have yet to see any artifacts shooting in bright sun with high zoom, not even any lense flares which I truly expected, or in candle lit birthday with flash.  It has fast write times and very short power up wait.

I seriously cant believe I can carry around a camera with a 10x zoom inside my jean pockets. Truly remarkable. The 3\" screen is amazing. You can practically enjoy your pics right on screen w/o even printing them with the High Res output. Navigation is so easy on this camera. Something not surprising though if your already coming from another panny (FZ7 here). Picture quality is great. I tested it out today on standard and I would say its just as good as my FZ7 in daylight and better in lowlight (indoors). Image quality is great, and if you need extra sharpness you could always use the camera on \"Vivid mode\" or add a little with some post processing. The pics in Standard and natural mode PP very well. The wide angle is something new to me. Took some neat shots that looked very nice with the extra viewing angle.

For casual point-and-shooters, who print small prints, this camera is small, has a great zoom lens, and gives usable pictures.  For those like me, who like enlarging pictures, or cropping, this camera blurs details.  The Venus noise reduction system applies a blur to all images, greatly softening detail at high magnification.  At close magnification of test images, my old Canon S50 pocket digital camera provides much more crisp detail, while this Panasonic TZ3 blurs all the fine details in an image.  This was true in bright daylight, flash, at all ISO's, and was especially severe in low light.  After testing this, I returned it.If you want a casual point-and-shoot camera with a great zoom lens, this is a good choice.  If you are into semi-serious use of the images, you will find loss of detail unacceptable.UPDATE:  I've since discovered that all current \"ultracompact\" cameras have worse picture quality than the compact digital cameras of a few years ago.  Since people continue to buy tiny cameras, the camera makers are putting in much smaller CCD's than a few years ago.  So if you're like me and you have a compact digital camera that's a few years old, don't count on any of the current ultracompact models to do as good a job.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera with few disappointments", "Author": "Jayayess1190", "ReviewID": "R1D2MA8FUCAMS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.

After way too much on-line research, I'd bought this as a back-up to my Canon Rebel XTi (with its 20+ lb. of lenses and accessories). The TZ-3 has a few shortcomings, but what a fine and fun camera!Outdoor image quality is excellent. The 28-280 Leica lens is amazingly versatile, capturing everything from landscapes and Serengeti sunsets to a leopard in a tree at 100 yards (not a full frame image, but quite usable). The interface is very user friendly. In any mode you just hold down the function key and up comes an on-screen menu of available adjustments and settings. The screen itself is just awesome - big, bright and beautiful.Two of the stops on the mode selection wheel can be set to your favorite of the many available modes. There's an excellent macro mode. The sunset mode produces spectacular images. The night portrait mode is surprisingly effective, although you may need a tripod prevent blurring of the background. The IS (image stabilization) feature works great, but you will still need a tripod or other support if you zoom out to the full 10x.There's an intelligent ISO mode which is handy in variable lighting (as long as you limit the ISO to 400 - see below). The movie mode is quite usable. Movies and stills can both be shot in 16:9 aspect ratio - very cool if you have a widescreen TV for playback.The camera is solidly built and heavy for its size. (It's got a lot of lens for such a small camera.) But unlike most superzooms, it fits fine in a pants pocket.There are a few drawbacks to the TZ-3. It's a shame Panasonic didn't add Av and Tv (aperture priority and shutter priority) modes, which would give the user a little more artistic control. Sometimes the f-stop settings the camera selects are less than ideal. Low light image quality is only so-so. As with most compact cameras, the flash is not that helpful. As has been widely reported, ISO settings over 200 do show too much noise control. Use them only if you're desperate, and make sure to set ISO to 100 in the default mode. The lack of a view finder takes some getting used to, but they'd have to shrink that lovely screen to add one - a bad move in my opinion. It would be nice to be able to zoom while you're shooting movies, but I guess the zoom noise would be a problem. None of these mattered enough to make me rate the camera at less than 5 stars, though.I highly recommend this camera for travel and outdoor photography (e.g. kid sports). Do be sure to pick up an extra battery (generic) and a couple of SD cards. Use 2.0 GB or 4.0 GB SDHC cards if you're want to use the movie mode at full resolution. A screen protector might be a good idea if you're going to carry it around in your pocket.If you're interested in more details, dcresource and dpreview both have thorough reviews of the TZ-3.Overall, I'd buy this camera again in a heartbeat.

As many have said nothing is perfect. I have been out in the field several times in the afternoon and using the \"power LCD\" setting I was easily able to make out the montitor and set up my shots.  I live in an extreme desert environment, so I can't imagine another area brighter than where I am at unless you go to the Sahara; you can see the monitor fine.  As for the flash and night shots I have been experimenting with using the slow shutter speeds with and without immage stabalization.  I was able to simulate candid shots in almost pitch dark (using the flash) by playing with the shutter speed, metering, white balance and exposure settings.  I took some surpringly good pictures at lower ISO and with AUTO ISO, but did find when using 800 or 1250 the pictures did appear quite grainy or \"noisy.\"  Absolute range was probably no more than 15-20' but how much range do you expect from a point and shoot flash?Daylight shots are great, and I am enjoying working with the cameras menus to deal with daylight issues and taking great pictures with too much direct light in many cases where i live.  The 10x zoom is great and the digital zoom and addtional magnification available in smaller megapixel sizes is great.  I waited quite a long time to purchase a digital camera and think the $[...] I spent on this camera is well worth the money given the picture quality, versatiliy and the options available for use through the various camera menus. A note on the bulkiness of the camera.  Umm...I personally am not looking for a spy camera to play Mission Impossible. If it was any smaller it would be difficult to manipulate the controls. It fits snugly in its case and is hardly noticeable thrown around my shoulder. Highly Recommended for the traveler and the beginner digital photographer if you practice, practice, practice. If you want a camera where you set the automatic controls and literally point and shoot, this is not the camera for you.

The surprise feature that I would rank #2 is the easy-to-set-up scene modes, which I found very useful in practice.

IMO, the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the TZ1.As others have said, this camera has a great build quality, easy operation, and a high-quality look. I ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. It has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera, which is cool. The chrome (or polished stainless steel, cant tell), is first rate and looks great with the matte black case. The LCD is huge and bright. The camera's \"Simple Mode\" does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable. The zoom is fantastic, but you need a really steady hand at full zoom, even with Optical Stabilization turned on.

Excellent picture quality, good interface (not perfect - sometimes hard to figure out exactly what \"mode\" will yield the best pictures), beautiful and large LCD (with high setting for outdoor viewing), and that fantastic 10x zoom that takes close-ups and long shots with equal aplomb.All the features work extremely well and I've been very impressed with outside, inside, low-light, flash and backlit pictures that I've taken (and I've taken about 400 to date). The battery life is very good, lasting about 200 pics from what I estimate. While it doesn't charge with USB (which would be ideal) or have a cradle, the charger is very small and light and easy to travel with. The features on the camera are mostly automatic, but many can be adjusted manually pretty quickly to adjust to the situation.I'm also impressed with the video, in particular the ability to take 16:9 format video (and still shots too) makes it a must-have for anyone with an HD TV. The video isn't quite HD, but it looks fantastic on the TV. The only downside is how much space the video takes (I assume because of the Quicktime format).

Since I was going to be traveling, it needed to be compact (not necessarily tiny), have a large zoom (I was trying to avoid becoming lunch for the lions by having to get too close for pictures) and have strong battery life.In general, the Panasonic TZ3 exceeded my expectations.  Here's a run down:Pros:1. Zoom Lense - the 10x zoom is outstanding.  If this were a 35mm camera, the lense would have a rating of 28mm to 280mm zoom  (hence the 10x).  28mm is a great wide angle and is perfect for taking group shots or panoramas.  The 280mm is a great telephoto - 50mm is equivalent to natural vision, the 280mm is equivalent to a 6x magnification.  The camera also comes with two levels of Optical Image Stabilization which helps reduce camera shake and allows for better pictures.  This is absolutely critical when working at the 280mm end of the zoom lense.2. Size and weight - the camera is compact, but not necessarily pocketable in jeans.  It fits nicely into purses and jacket pockets.  The camera has some heft, which ensures that you can hold the camera steady when taking pictures (this is absolutely critical at high magnifications). Moreover, it imparts a feeling of quality.3. Great travel features - Panasonic designed this camera with a traveler in mind.  There are some useful features for travelers including: 1) multiple time zone clocks, 2) entering dates for a trip so that when reviewing pictures you can just go to a date and look at pictures for that date (believe me, when you have 500 pictures on a card, this date feature is very handy), 3) availability of dark colors like black, since it doesn't draw the attention of animals, 4) numerous settings that are conducive to travel (e.g., panorama, sunsets, night stars, etc.)4. Great LCD Screen - it's 3\".  It's almost the size of a photograph and the resolution is outstanding.5. Battery Life - The battery is pretty strong. I averaged 50 pictures a day on my trip and didn't even get down below 75% on the camera battery meter.  Considering I used flash and the LCD, it is impressive battery life.6. Picture Quality - In the end what we want is good pictures.  Daylight pictures from this camera are outstanding.  The camera has several modes - standard, natural, vivid.  The vivid mode makes the colors pop off the page and basically makes the pictures look like they were from a Canon camera.  The colors are natural, but as I will list in the cons, I have seen other cameras that somehow change the colors slightly to make them more appealing.Cons:1. Flash - The flash is OK, it's not great and not bad.  It is useful for normal use; however, it is not powerful enough when using the zoom to reach subjects that are a little farther away.2. Colors - The colors of this camera are natural.  My other digital camera - a Nikon Cooplix 5200 - seems to produce nicer colors even though they are not accurate.

That was my first digital camera after a closet-full of film Nikons.Many buffs claim that 4 megapixels is all you need, and I made a number of nice looking A3 prints. Now that I have 7 megapixels to work with, I see that I was wrong: Four is not enough. Seven is wonderful.[...]points out strongly that above ISO 200 noise is a real problem--but you always wonder just how picky they are. Well not too picky in this case. Using a higher than 200 setting (i.e., most indoor flash shots) resulted in a lot of noise, making the camera almost unusable except for the simplest 4 X 6 snapshots.But I take almost entirely outdoor shots--scenics and candids. I set the ISO at 100 and get gorgeous results. It has taken some getting used to the different color rendition of the TZ3 from my Canon. The Canon seems more balanced while the TZ3 caused reddish orange to really pop out. There is something cool (color temperature-wise, not \"fashionable\") about the color that is not entirely fixed in PhotoShop. Sometimes the results are marvelous, especially shots of cloudy or rainy days. Other times they are not so great--too desaturated for my taste.  So I have been playing around with the various settings--\"Natural\" and \"Vivid.\" \"Vivid\" is closer to what I want right out of the camera, but is less easy to spruce up. \"Natural\" is easier to modify, so that is the setting I am using now. I also set the exposure compensation to one stop under.I was pleasantly surprised at how small the TZ3 is: it slips easily into pants pocket (but not shirt pocket). The zoom lens starting at a decent wide-angle (28mm) is utterly fantastic and really makes the camera stand out head & shoulders from the pack.Thus, I am delighted with the choice. However, to answer my question \"What more could I want?\", here it is:1. The selection disk ALWAYS moves when I pocket the camera, so I ALWAYS have to check, when I pull it out, to reset it to the desired setting. Its detents need to be strengthened.2. The back-side controls are too easy to activate accidentally when shooting one-handed with the fleshy part of the thumb.

At 3mp you could have 15x.Based on the images I've shot, 5mp is plenty for any printing or cropping.The screen is beautiful.  I miss a viewfinder.

There are so many out there that it becomes difficult to evaluate them. Canon, alone, offers about 30 digital cameras. I read somewhere to look for the features that are important to you and then choose from that group. I found this to be helpful advice. I didn't want a bulky camera that wouldn't fit in my pocket and would be tethered around my neck. That eliminated a number of cameras. My existing camera (a Fuji digital from 2003) has 3x zoom, and I was intrigued by reviews touting cameras with super zoom. Some of the new cameras have an image stabilization feature. I sometimes had blurred pictures with the Fuji, so I definitely wanted this feature. I also read about face detection technology, where the camera can detect faces in a shot and optimize the settings for that shot. Picture quality was also an important-- actually the most important-- feature. I also read a review noting the importance of a viewfinder.With all these criteria, I came up with the Lumix. This was somewhat of a compromise: the Lumix doesn't have a viewfinder and doesn't have face detection technology, though it does have a \"scene mode\" where you can select certain pre-set scenes (portrait, scenic landscape, sports, etc) with the settings optimized so that offered a lesser version of face detection. I always check Consumer Reports for its recommendations, but the latest issue on cameras (July 07) did not include this Lumix model. I did, however, find a few camera sites with in-depth reviews (including feedback from owners) that was very helpful, including[...][...][...][...]I have been very pleased with the Lumix. It takes *great* pictures (better than my Fuji, which was top rated by Consumer Reports), fits right in my pocket, is extremely easy to use, has a 10x zoom, and has a long battery life. The ease-of-use is a big improvement over the Fuji. Like most digital cameras, the Lumix uses a dial to select its different modes. When you switch modes, the LCD flashes the name of the mode you have selected, which is very helpful. Speaking of the LCD, it's an awesome high-quality display 3-inch display, which makes shooting and reviewing photos very easy.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Lumix.

I historically have been a \"Canon Man\" and I love my Elph, G5 and 20D but having read many positive reviews in several magazines as well as online photo sites, I decided to pick up this Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3. Having just returned from vacation in Turkey with over 800 pictures and 20 movie snippets, I'm convinced I found it in this camera.Now what, you may ask is a \"travel camera?\" It's perhaps more a marketing term as can't ALL camera's travel? Of course they can but then this has a few features that make it a perfect travel companion. For one, it's compact. Not quite as compact as a deck of cards but small enough that I took it every where all day and night long. This is a key benefit when you are traveling as you never know when you might want to capture that perfect shot. Another feature is that it has a very versatile 10x optical zoom lens ranging from 28mm to 280mm. This zoom proved very handy when I needed to capture a shot over hundreds of mutually admiring touristy heads. The wide angle also did a fine job - particularly when I was trying to capture the entire remarkably restored Ephesus library. At the end of the day, I wanted to go back and review my pictures. The photo review features not only allow you to scroll through previously taken pictures but another mode gives you a calendar view so that you can go back and see all the pictures you took last Wednesday when you were in Istanbul.Since I consider myself a photo snob and self declared \"pro-consumer\", I was very interested in photo quality. Again, the camera didn't disappoint yielding sharp images, accurate colors and very little noise - particularly at the lower ISO settings. I tried as much as possible to keep it in the 100 to 200 ISO range. I upped the ISO to 800 when I was touring the mosques resulting in more noise but no more so than any other camera in this class.Battery life was great but if you are going to travel, pick up another battery as you'd hate to run out of juice mid-day. It may not be necessary but I'm a big believer in fully running your battery down before recharging it.  I was able to plug the charger into the wall using only a prong converter - no voltage adjuster necessary since the charger is a variable 110 to 220 volts.I could go on and on but I think you get the idea that I would recommend this camera - not just for travel but for any other photography pursuit.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K", "Author": "ds2021", "ReviewID": "R39PKSV7PK8AA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although not necessarily immediately apparent at first glance, digital camera technology has come a long way in the past few years. We needed to replace a DSC-T1, state of the art at its time, due to increasing frustration with missed shots. With a new baby, the need to get a shot quickly and the first time is critical. With the T1, there were far too many times where we needed to try and try again, at which point the chance was lost.Another part of the consideration was zoom. After a recent trip to Alaska, the 3X optical zoom proved entirely inefficient for anything other than someone standing in front of you.The TZ3K has solvved our problems admirably. It is an easy-to-use camera which we bought trhough Amazon and put through its paces on a trip to Martha's Vineyard with the baby. We were constantly amazed at how the camera was able to interpret the setting to compensate for problems, account for the baby moving, and get a great shot the first time. We kept taking second shots because we are used to it, but inevitably it was the first shot that was better.For a small camera, it is remarkable that it can handle 10X optical zoom at 7.2 megapixels. Surprisingly, they do not market that it can do better. By changing the resolution to 5MP, you can get 12X optical zoom, 15X optical at 3MP (which is perfectly fine for printing up to 5X7 prints), and so on.We are thrilled with the camera.

Look forward to shooting snow, sunsets, fireworks, etc.I'm getting used to not having a view finder, although still wish I had one, if only to steady the camera against my face. I guess advanced image stabilizing makes LCD screens and 10x zoom lenses more practical. Admittedly we greatly appreciate the 3 inch screen. Now the kids always want to see the shot right after it's taken. It's fun. The screen is glorious.As far as motion pictures, I find it hard to believe people regularly use this camera in place of their camcorder; nonetheless, it is handy to have the capability on hand at all times.The AV cable works well to plug the camera into the front of a big screen TV. We watched the pictures of a birthday dinner last night while we all ate cake back at the house.I'm wondering when Lumix will put out a new version of this camera with more mega pixels. I notice when I blow up pictures on the computer screen, the quality quickly deteriorates. Where's the 10 or 12 MP pocket-sized Lumix with 10x zoom? I know, I want it all now.Recommend you buy a USB card reader. They're cheap, and you can scroll from picture to picture with almost no lag time. Not so with the USB cable linked to the camera.The 4GB card is great, but in hindsight, 2 2GB cards might have been more practical, if only to make it super simple to keep topics separate when, for example, viewing a slide show of the day's event with the participants. Guess I'll need to move further along the camera's learning curve to partition my card.In sum, the camera is everything as advertised, and more.Update After 3 Months and 2,000 Pictures:This camera rocks. At family get-togethers, we gather around the computer and take turns showing photos. Siblings and Mom have Canons. Everyone raves about the color of the Lumix pictures. I told them to set their cameras to \"vivid\" and they say they have and it doesn't help.The 10x zoom comes in far more handy than I ever imagined. And I've learned that extra zoom is better than extra megapixels for image clarity.Rented a skiff in Puerto Vallarta last month to snorkel at the islands. We lucked out to learn the humped-back whales had arrived early. We had the camera handy as usual, and so were able to film them in all their glory. Audio worked fine to. Also, at a recent swearing-in ceremony of mine, my gf surprised me and used the Lumix to capture my moment on video. We don't own a camcorder, so I hadn't even thought to record it.

Despite its small size, the optically stabilized lens resulted in some great photos in the cities, countrysides and towns of Europe.  In places where I couldn't use a flash, available light photos were astounding.  Photos taken with the 28-mm wide angle lens came through in tight areas with very little lens distortion.

In fact, I did not miss my large DSLR at all.  As far as I am concerned, Panasonic has produced the best pocket sized camera ever.Pros include; the 10X optically stabilized lens (if you are looking for a telephoto lens, make sure it is OPTICALLY stabilized); the 28 mm wide angle lens (comes in handy when shooting in close quarters); Panasonic's Lumix photo processing engine; the huge 3\" LCD; the LCD's super bright viewing (which brightens up the image nicely in bright sunlight mostly obviating the necessity for a viewfinder); its over-the-head viewing angle; the built-in lens protector; fairly long-lived batteries; compact size; its great Leica lens (among the very top lens makers), and many other things.As far as I am concerned, there are no cons.This is a must have for all photographers.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great small camera", "Author": "Dennis Wilcox", "ReviewID": "R1TY5L2HWH0O9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera has an absolutely fabulous Leica lens.

I was even able to upload pictures from a different camera and the panasonic would play them! 8GB SDHC worked fine.- Great user interface and advanced features like Exposure Bracketing (not even Nikon D40/D40x has that).Cons:- Bad picture quality, especially at low light. Canon compacts, despite the bad lens distortion, have better color, lower noise, and better (less detail-robbing) noise reduction. The TZ3's images have significant color bleeding, especially the red color's. Small prints look OK but large prints, or watching images in HD on a big screen reveals the disappointing image quality. Lock the camera to ISO 100 to mitigate these problems.- USB is slow (USB 1.1 speed). Not sure why no Parasonic compact offers USB 2.0 high speed; canons have for years.- No optical zoom, and no autofocus in movie mode (focus and zoom stay fixed once you start capture).Conclusion:Disappointed with what's out there. Panasonic has superb lens, bad sensor / IQ. Canon compacts have better sensors & image processing, but poor lenses. If Panasonic could buy sensors from Canon, Sony, or Fuji they would sweep the market because they are otherwise great compact cameras!I was surprised to discover that modern cameras have worse image quality than my old Canon S40 (4-megapixel).In the last 6-7 years there's been no progress on compact camera image quality. Apart from developing cool features like image stabilization, manufacturers are cramming more and more useless megapixels to tiny sensors; degrading image quality year after year. I wish manufacturers re-introduce high-end, modern 6-megapixel compact cameraswith larger sensors (hey, entry level DSLRs have 6MP, who needs more in a compact?).Because image quality while watching slideshows in HDTV is most important to me, I decided to stick with a Canon, and use fulla (a utility that comes with the opensource hugin-tools software) to correct its lens distortion in batch mode.

Now these shots were not underexposed (the camera even upped the Iso and I thought it was a well enough lit room) and once the pictures were printed their hair was \"clumped\" together (this is also on that same review at dpreview, it states \"At ISO 100 only the very finest detail is being blurred away by the Venus III noise reduction, but at ISO 200 (and increasingly as you go up the range) the characteristic 'smearing' of tones reduces the individual hairs to a single lump.\"I have seen on the internet MANY MANY an MANY great shots taken with this camera outdoors and in well lit rooms (not so much personal homes).

I remembered 5 miles and 65 mph later.  Then we heard a clatter and saw a faint black spot flash by the back window.  I thought I was going to throw up.

Sadly, the quality of most images produced by the TZ3 are not very good. Only pictures taken outdoors and with lots of light turn out well. My old Canon S1-IS takes much better pictures overall, even though it is only 3.2 megapixel. Enlargements of the 3.2 MP photos show more detail than photos at 5 or 7 MP on the Panasonic. This is pretty dissapointing, especially when I expected the higher pixel count to equal better picture quality at high magnification. I agree with other reviewers that say that the pictures are soft with blurred detail. Some photos have a strange painted or blocky look. Most photos are grainy and noisy even after trying all available settings. Some have suggested locking the camera at ISO 100, but unless you have lots of light on the subject, the photos turn out way too dark. I have taken over 400 photos with this camera and can say that only about 30 photos could be considered keepers (and nearly all of these were taken outside in bright daylight), and only about 40 others could be considered useable photos for enlargements. If you only plan on 4 x 6 prints, then most images should work for you. The flash is weak, so you need to shoot close to the subject to get good results with it.Now for the good things: Great wide angle and excellent zoom, nice LCD screen, good size (main reason for upgrading from Canon S1-IS), good quality look and feel. I'd say this camera is best suited for travel and outdoors use, but is not that great for indoor use. I will keep using this camera because of its compactness and ease of use and since I spend alot of time outdoors, but will keep the Canon ready with charged batteries for times when I need to be SURE that the image will be acceptable and useable.UPDATE:It's been a couple of days since my initial review and I feel like I should add a little to what I've said. I did not see the 150 or so images that were submitted on the customer images link until today. Anyone seeing most of those probably think this camera is awesome. I feel I must warn those thinking this way that these are SMALL examples of photos and that when you blow them up even a little bit, the lack of detail and other oddities quickly begin to show themselves. I will say, however, that nearly all of the submitted photos are outdoor scenery pics or shots of inanimate things, and these are going to look the best out of all the photos one is likely to take, as I said above. But beware of photos taken indoors, particularly in low light and of people's faces (strange colors, blotches, etc.) Also, beware of night shots or \"high sensitivity\" shots of any kind. They are full of added unwanted noise and makes the photo look unrealistic. The only way around this, to some extent, is with \"night scenery\" mode, but you MUST have a tripod, as shutter speed is very slow.I hope anyone reading this does not think I hate this camera, because I don't. Maybe, in a way, I'm sending a message to the maker of this camera \"YOU CAN DO BETTER!\"  I just can't figure out why the image quality has to suffer so much just to get a smaller camera with decent zoom. Heck, almost everything electronic has improved as it has gotten smaller, why not cameras? I guess camera size trumps image quality, as thousands of people are buying them and somehow think they are great because they fit in their pocket. Maybe I'm a little picky, but I think the manufacturers should perfect the technology before bombarding the market with highly desirable small cameras that disappoint those who truly appreciate the quality of a great photo.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Top of the Pile", "Author": "Mark N.

Once they were able to get passed the stereotypic recognition for certain brands, tried them side-by-side and realized what this little camera can produce, most of them are either happy TZ3 users now or are considering it.Since most reviewers here have said it all, I just want to emphasize some strong points of TZ3 for potential buyers' consideration:1. The Leica lens2. The flexibility (including the 10x zoom, 28 mm, and 16:9 ratio, just to name a few)3. Very effective OIS4. Simple and intuitive operation5.

I really wanted to love this camera, but after using the camera I really can't recommend it. Read on. I once owned a Panasonic FZ5 and took many outstanding pictures with it before I upgraded to a DSLR. I bought the TZ3 as an easy to carry alternative for those days when I wasn't up to lugging around my DSLR. The TZ3 only fills the bill in good outdoor light, or when using a flash about 8 - 10 feet away. The low light performance of the camera is dreadful and it even losses detail at ISO 100. This, I have read, is because of excessive noise reduction processing. The flash is very wimpy, which compounds the inability of the TZ3 to take pictures indoors at night. The image stabilization is a nice feature, but you quickly use it up, because the TZ3's small size makes it hard to hold steady. It might just be me, but I also find the camera misses focus a lot. The net result of all of the above is a lot of blurry pictures. This was a common complaint I noticed in the reviews here on Amazon, before I bought the TZ3 anyway, thinking these reviewers were just inexperienced. I now think the people who are rating this camera highly are the ones who are inexperienced.The colors produced by the camera are also a little under saturated for my taste, which is an easy adjustment on most cameras, but there is very little you can adjust on the TZ3. You can limit maximum ISO, which you definitely need to do. White balance is adjustable, but the auto white balance is one thing that does work pretty well on the TZ3. Exposure compensation is the only other manual control and it can be useful, as the TZ3 often wants to overexpose by a 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop.What can I say? After having great luck with the Panasonic FZ5 I was expecting this to be a slam dunk. Maybe I have become jaded after a couple years of seeing what a DSLR can produce, but my wife has a discontinued Cannon A620 that runs circles around the TZ3 in image quality.The best feature of this camera is the 28mm wide angle capability of its lens. This is a significant upgrade from the 35-36mm found on most digital cameras. The 10x zoom range found only on the TZ3 is certainly useful, but not at the price of image quality. I have returned the TZ3 and will look at one of the Canon models that offer a 28mm lens with a 3X or 4x zoom range. These Canon cameras are also truly pocket size, where as with the TZ3 is too heavy and thick to be something you want to have in your pocket all day long.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "The whole package", "Author": "Aaron Christensen", "ReviewID": "R372722D1FUOEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not really a photography buff, but this camera is turning me into one!

It just doesn't have the performance for capturing action, and it wasn't up to the task of handling the lighting typically found in a gym.  Even after trying numerous adjustments, I had to accept that is was the wrong camera for us.  We did take a number of outdoor shots, which turned out great, though.  Knowing we had a trip to Disney coming up in a few weeks, we decided to pack it up and send it back.  I'm sure this camera would've served most of our needs, but having two boys in sports just requires a camera with better performance.So I resumed my research, and decided to go with a Fuji S8000fd.  Though this is a much larger camera, I believe it will prove much more versatile.If you don't plan on shooting action shots, I'm sure the TZ3 would be a really good choice.  Otherwise, you're better off spending an extra $100 or so and picking up something with better performance.

Although initially it seemed hard to differentiate between cameras with similar features in our price range: one thing about the Lumix stood out: the fact that it has a Leica lens.Let me tell you, they're all correct: the Leica makes a difference.When we tested it, the picture quality was sharp and crisp. The physical zoom ability is downright crazy in a consumer point and shoot, and the large 3\" LCD display view screen on the back makes taking shots a breeze. We even tested its video ability and were able to capture short videos that were as good in quality (downloaded to my computer) as those we get from our Sony dvd video cam. (just cant shoot as long, of course.)We got it in black, which is a very slick look. I argued with my wife about it, she wanted silver. Ha! I won (for once) and once she held it in her hand, she admitted black was better (I marked on my calendar that my wife admitted I was right. Its a lonely calendar)Now for the Cons: The biggest negative is that the manual is bit murky to figure out. Expect to spend some quantity and quality time with it. Even though I'm used to working with manuals, my wife is the kind of person who ignores manuals, and she got to use the camera first and kept hitting brick walls in figuring things out: in other words, some features are NOT intuitive, and the icons on the camera itself don't automatically communicate to you what they mean.So she made me read the manual, and I have to admit, it took even me (Mr. \"I always read the manual\") a while, going back over pages I'd already read in order to get it fully.  Once you spend the time with the manual, though, its well worth it!I would recommend getting the largest memory card you can afford. We also got an extra battery, just in case.The camera comes with a cable to connect with your computer (usb) as well as to connect directly to your TV (kind of a wild way to review your photos if you have a large flat screen tv). It comes with a charger as well.So far, the battery life seems very good. We didn't invest in an expensive case, and just got an inexpensive one at a camera store that seems to be just fine.

This make shooting back lit subjects very difficult.- The lens is not very bright, on dark situations pictures tend to be dark compared to my other camera, an Olympus Camedia C2040 Zoom 3x. I particularly miss the way the flash could illuminate quite far away..-The lens cover is flimsy at best and very delicate..- On dark situations you can get blurry images even with a tripod, very sensible to the subject's movement unless you use flash..- There are no manual controls, only preprogramed shooting modes. It would be nice to at least have the option of having aperture or speed control and the rest in auto.-The zoom does not work when shooting videoThe pre-programed exposure settings work, but most of them use the flash.Overall I have a mixed feeling about this camera. It is a very portable machine, with good behavior but it seems it only work in daylight or with the flash, which is not very potent. Pictures tend to be soft looking, even with the high pixel count. The image stabilization works if the subject is well lit.The camera produces  good tonal range when the exposure is correct - mainly in daylight conditions- but it lacks contrast, at least on the normal setting.I think is a good camera for traveling,  a good point & shoot, but anyone looking for at least a little bit of control is out o luck with this one.I will update this review if I find a way to solve some of the issues mentioned.

I've tried many Canon compacts, a Fujifilm, and this one. I've had this camera almost a year. When using Vivid color mode, the outdoor photos are truly fantastic. You really need Vivid color mode (the standard color mode makes it a bit washed out), but that is a really easy setting to set and then voila - you have wonderful photos very easily. I just use the \"i\" setting and leave it at that.I also love the UI. Very easy to use, easy to handle, sturdy camera, easy to navigate the menu system. I love that you can pre-program the two SCN modes on the dial. We went on vacation and I put SCN1 on Landscape and SCN2 on Kids and Pets. I could easily switch between modes on the fly w/out having to go into the menu system. This is awesome.I took this camera to a Wiggles concert and took videos and photos. I was amazed - the photos were actually in focus! And I wasn't near the front either. The videos were good too, except I wish they were saved in AVI format and not MOV. The zoom is also amazing. We were driving through Wyoming and we saw some bighorn sheep way off in the distance. We stopped the car and I zoomed out to the max and took a photo - it was actually quite great! We were really really surprised at how great the photo was a max zoom.My ONLY complaint - and it is quite big - the indoor photos suck. I mean, they are truly terrible. They are only good if you are just a few feet from your subject. I believe part of the problem is the aggressive Noise Reduction Panasonic included in the camera. I wish I could turn it off. If you are 4' or more and want to take a group picture or a picture of people sitting on a couch, or a table, forget it. Even after a year, I can't figure it out. I've tried different color modes, limiting the ISO (which is what the Panasonic support team suggested), trying different flash modes (they also suggest the slow sync mode), different scene modes, different exposure ratings, etc. Nothing I can find seems to make them acceptable. The best combination I found so far is using the regular Auto mode (NOT the \"i\" intelligent ISO mode), and limiting the ISO to 200.I've read the manual, talked to Panasonic (sent them a photo and they agree it is terrible), and nothing seems to make the indoor shots really decent. Maybe other people don't have this problem, don't take indoor shots as often, or know something I don't.Anyway, if you take mostly outdoor shots or shots in really dark places (like concerts), then this is great. If you take most photos in the house, at evening or during the day - you might think twice.

The great features of this camera are 10x Wide Angle Leica lens, full 7mp in any format, size, flexibility, portability and image quality. This is my fifth digital camera. I started with 1MP Kodak, then 2MP Ricoh, then 4MP Canon and Sony. I took a large number of images in every possible setting and finally figure out what works and what does not. This might be one of the reasons why so many people complain about the image quality. My settings are as follows - 9 point focus, AF lamp off, vivid. For outdoors I use Smart ISO limited to 400 or Regular mode limited to 100. Please note that you must make a decision on EV setting and Flash to get the best picture. But, you will know as you start playing. Indoors is a bit more complicated - I use ISO 100 and 3x2 mode when I am close to the subject and ISO 200 when more distant plus EV +1; for dark rooms Smart ISO with EV of -1 works the best. It is true that noise is reduced by loss in image sharpens at ISO above 200. However, try and make the same take with an older camera and you will find out that image is even worse. Overall, I have worked with cameras that take great indoor images. But, those had a much better flash. I think the only issue with this camera is its very limited flash. To get a proper indoor flash you must remain close to the subject and use 4x3 mode. Flash coverage is uneven in 3x2 or 16x9 modes.The Good:1. Optical System2. Size3. Image Quality4.

While the TZ3 is not small enough to slip into your jeans pocket, you can certainly carry it in a jacket pocket or a purse. I considered a couple of 7x optical zoom cameras that were a bit smaller but the reviews on those were mixed whereas the reviews on the TZ3 were consistently good. Panasonic also has the lowest repair rate of the major camera brands.So far I have been extremely pleased with my choice. One thing that I did not even consider before purchasing was the wide angle of the lense. It wasn't until I took some test pictures inside with my old digital camera and compared the same shots using the TZ3 that I noticed how much more of the room you could get into the frame with the Panasonic. The zoom range is excellent and the pictures are clear even at full zoom. The on screen menus are easy to navigate and there are fun features like being able to dub audio onto a picture after taking it. The movie mode takes smooth clear movies and does well inside with normal room lighting. The sound quality is decent although the mic doesn't pick up sounds across the room very well. The only reason I gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think pictures taken inside at fairly close range tend to be a little bright unless you adjust the exposure. But I certainly am no professional photographer so that may just be user error. I just back off the exposure a little and all is fine.

I read most of the reviews here and a few people raised this issue, but said the quality was fine for regular users.  It is not!!I tested this camera the way I would use it most-indoor photos of my kids.  I'm no pro, but I read the manual throroughly and tested out most of the controllable features.  The flash gave their skin a green tone, and adjusting white balance and changing the color options did not help.  Pics without flash had fine skin tone, but were out of focus unless the subject was absolutely still-not practical for candid kid shots.  The image stabilization didn't help the focus and made picture quality worse (see below).The pictures totally lacked the crisp, clear details that to me are the hallmark of a digital camera.  The processing system in the camera blurs pixels together, giving the pictures a smeared, painted look that I don't like.  Even my 1 Megapixel Nikon Coolpix from six years ago gave far superior clarity and detail.  When I used image stabilization, the smearing was much worse, with clumps of odd reddish glop in my daughter's brown hair.  Bright colors seemed to bleed into the white background.  In a brightly lit room, flash pictures gave odd bluish shadows on the white cabinets in the background, and non-flash pictures had bizarre ghost shadows behind the person pictured.I really wanted to like this camera.  It's a great size for such a big zoom, the wide angle was really useful for getting pics where you can't back up, the menus were very easy to learn, you have lots of control.  But all of that is useless becaues the pictures are no good.  I replaced it with a Canon SX100 with most of the same features and a few more.

I bought it because I wanted a small and simple point and shoot to bring along when I didn't feel like lugging around my bigger, heavier digital SLR.  I also wanted good quality.  All the reviews indicated this was the camera to buy for those purposes.  When the camera shoots well, it shoots phenomenally well, but there are a lot of duds on simple shoots as well.  I have found that while it is extremely easy to use, the built in \"scene\" indicators need to be tweaked to my liking. For instance the candle light setting works better than the macro setting for taking close up photos outdoors.  And the high sensitivity scene didn't work well at all when photographing a friend of mine who was performing on stage. The result was photos with extreme grain. Hopefully, I can manipulate the camera enough to get good photos next time around.  Outdoor scenery did well, but I had to adjust the EV and that took time I really didn't want to take, expecially when trying to photo a heron about ready for take off.The ads read that this is a great camera for travel and it probably is if you are just snapping pics of standing still buildings and posed people.That's really not my schtick.

The camera handled beautifully and the battery life was great considering I took approximately 3000 pictures on our trip.  Upon returning home and uploading the pictures to my iMac, I was surprised to see an odd grey cast to the skin in nearly every photo of my family. (Having them printed produced the same grey cast-- even directly from the SD card.)  I put it down to user error, even though I have been an avid photographer since childhood, taking photography classes and developing my one prints for years-- years ago.  I checked out the camera settings, read the manual again and tried custom settings, rather than the \"heart\" (auto) setting.  No better.  Sometimes worse.  Pictures from a winter trip to NYC and Central Park were downright bizarre, so I discussed it with the photo person at the store where the prints were made and she suggested adjusting it (for the life of me I can no longer remember in which way) and the grey tones came out, my children looked great.  (BTW, they both have lighter toned Caucasian skin, just for clarity).  Again and again I have blamed myself, even though the 2 digitals I had before this purchase (which I replaced due to simply wearing one out or looking for newer features and better mp size) both provided me with stunningly clear, naturally colored photos, even with a 3.1 mp camera!!  I was surprised to notice one other poor review mentioned another odd photo occurance-- an almost painted look on the faces of some of the people.  No settings were adjusted.  It is on factory settings.  But the faces have an almost penciled in look at the eyes and at smile lines.  Creepily strange.  Occurs about 1/3 of the time.I was very excited to purchase this Panasonic DMC-TZ3 and did my research beforehand, checking review after review.  When I make my next PAS camera purchase, it will be somewhere that I can return it within 30-60 days or so and I will no longer blame myself when the auto setting produces such oddly tinted photos.  Nothing is perfect, and I must say this camera certainly has not helped me preserve my memories for the last year and half, for despite the fact that I have uploaded more than 35,000 digital photos to my iPhoto in the time since I bought it, the fact that I must continually go in and adjust photos before being able to print them is ridiculous and time consuming.If you consider purchasing this camera, by all means give it a thorough run through before your return period is up.  It enlarges photos beautifully, so as long as skin tones and colors are accurate, takes quite good action photos on the sports/high burst setting and the video was very good.

At that point, it was almost no different than my (very large) F-707, and the photos it takes do not approach the Sony.In short, it was the wrong compromise for me. I suspect this would be a good camera for a lot of people as an \"only\" camera, but it did not fit my needs as a portable. Perhaps I am spoiled by my 6 year old Sony.

The main reasons to buy this Panasonic where:+ 28mm wide angle (you always want to get more people into your party picture, or take as much of a landscape as you can)+ big lens dia (good for pictures in low light without flash)+ image stabilizer (good for pictures in low light without flash), this feature works very well+ 10x optical zoom (this is really impressive for such a small camera)+ small camera (it really fits in your pocket, the Canon G7 is about double thick and is quite a brick that does not fit in your pocket)+ 3\" TFT screen (you always want to review your photo's and show them around, a large screen is important)- After I started using the camera, I noticed colors are more \"flat\" compared to my old Canon SD230. So I changed the setting on the Panasonic from \"standard\" to \"natural\". A bit better but not really ok to me. I tried the \"vivid\" setting, but that was pushing the colors too hard. After this I realized Canon does a better job on color.- No view finder. When you are making a picture with the sun from your back, the 3\" screen glares so much that you cannot see what you are doing. The Canon SD230 has a very tiny 1.8\" screen, but it had a matte non glare finish so it did not reflect the sun so badly. Also the SD230 had a view finder. Panasonic should have done a non-glare finish on the 3\" screen or should have added a view finder.All in all, it is a very good little camera with excellent features for little money. I guess the Canon G7 (and now G9) camera's would have produced better color quality images, but those cameras cost a lot more and are too big in size for me.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix TZ-3", "Author": "K.

What sold me on it, as opposed to an FZ8, was the wider lens and the fact that I can carry it reasonably well in my pocket (which means I have my camera on me more often and take more pictures). In general I like the camera a lot but there are a few problems I have encountered.In normal light and especially natural light, the image quality is good. Pictures are crisp and the colors really pop. The 28mm wide angle lens is a big plus, and have really  give some of my pictures a great look. I'd say its the best feature on the camera. The gigantic LCD screen is also a really nice feature and I certainly don't miss the viewfinder.But on the downside, the shooting in low light can really be a problem. I've experienced a lot of noise and graininess, especially in low light but also in some indoor shots where I wouldn't have expected light to be a problem. Also, the camera sometimes has a hard time picking the right ISO, even with its intelligent ISO setting, and I have to go into the menu and pick the right one. The biggest problem is that in some of my low light photos you can see artifacts. For example, the edge of someone's hair will look like staircase, instead of a smooth line. Keep in mind that this was very low light, but I was still really surprised.The last thing is that I feel like I get more blurry pictures when I'm zoomed all the way in than I did with the FZ7. It's not a very common occurrence, but it almost never happened before. Maybe its just that the TZ3 is smaller and lighter.For its size its a great camera, much better than, say, a powershot.

However, the dynamic range is good enough you can salvage mis-shots with photoshop, etc.It would be nice if there were a cap available to cover the lens when stored.The battery life is nothing to write home about, and transferring files using usb or pict bridge seems to really drain the camera.Advise getting a spare battery and the optional DC power supply.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love Panasonic", "Author": "C. Reich", "ReviewID": "R3VXFH56FPH4RW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 4th Panasic camera/camcorder.  My small one, the FX9, developed a shadow on the lens, probably from the abuse it gets being in my pocket when I am using it on the move.  So I had to replace it.  And it is still available and is cheaper than the TZ3K, so I had a rough decision to make.I went with the TZ3K because it has a 10x zoom, compared to 6x on my other one.  You would not think this is a big deal, but my other Panasonic has a 12x zoom and you miss it when you don't have it.  The TZ3K is a bit bigger and heavier, which I like, given that my small one was probably damaged because it was so small.  That being said, you could slip the FX9 into any sized pocket while the TZ3K will not fit into most pants pockets.The TZ3K is the improved version of another Panasonic camera that looks just like this one, except that one has an outside lens cap and this one's cap is electronically built in.  Which is a great improvement, among many others.It has a good selection of presettings for things like night shots and fireworks, but you can not adjust any other settings.  If you want to get really creative and a presetting doesn't work, you need to step up a camera class.My only real complaint is that the flash is tiny and if the light is bad, this camera struggles to produce anything worthwhile.  If the subject is moving in a dimly lit room, forget it.  It can't handle it.  This is typical of most digital cameras so you can't ding Panasonic too hard on this.In bright light it works great, and if the subject is still and within range of the flash it works great.  Just don't expect a huge and powerful flash in this camera class.  And you have to watch how you hold the camera.  My wife tends to put a finger over the flash and blocks it even more unless she is paying attention.I like having a pocket camera for times when taking along my big Bertha is just a pain.  And it is simple enough to use that my wife uses it like a pro with very little instruction.Of course, as with all Panasonic products, no batteries can be interchanged with any other camera.  They have to get their pound of flesh somehow.  The battery life is ok, provided you are not using the flash a lot. In bright light I have gone all day shooting hundreds of pictures on one battery.

I have owned several cameras and the DMC-TZ3 is hands down the \"best value\" in digital cameras. It works extremely well on every level: Simplicity of operation for those of us who are not software engineers or techy nerds. Award-winning German made \"Leica lens.\"  Yes, the very same optical lens manufacturer world-renowned in the field of precision-quality optics for microscopes used in leading hospitals and laboratories througout the world. There is not a better lens in microscopy or camera optics than a Leica lens.Indeed, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3 is no ordinary digital zoom camera.  The DMC-TZ3 has a built-in \"wide angle\" 28mm starting point! So, now you can capture a really wide field of vision whether you're taking a picture in the living room, theater, or outdoors. Having an \"on-board\" wide angle lens is a BIG deal. Also, the DMC-TZ3 Lumix camera, with Leica optical zoom lens, has a telephoto reach of a whooping 10X \"optical\" super zoom. Now, you have the same level of clarity at a distant point that you have with close-up shots. One camera and one incredible lens does it all. DMC-TZ3 is really the ultimate \"bridge camera\" between a point-and-shoot and SLR.  No lens hassles, just simple fun and great world-class photography.Mega-pixels are important to a certain extent, but the lens is of equal importance. DMC-TZ3 Lumix 7.2MP camera with proprietery Venus III sensor and Leica lens is the perfect balance of mega-pixels and optics. The 3\" high resolution LCD display makes \"on-board\" picture/movie playback a viewing pleasure. Build quality is solid and camera balance is about on the bulls eye. Not so light or thin that you are likely to drop it, and just enough weight to instill confidence that you have a \"real camera\" in your hand, not a toy. In fact, the DMC-TZ3 will feel anatomically correct for most adult hands. Nice hand grip and dedicated spot to put your thumb to maintain operator control, and minimize \"camera-drop\" syndrome.

This purchase was our 5th digital camera, previously we've has two Canons, a Nikon, and an Olympus.  We were on vacation when our 4 year old Canon ELPH started to flake out and freeze up from time to time.  After 10000+ pictures I can't complain.So we decided to check out some cameras at some shops.  We played with Canons, Nikons, Fujis, and this Panasonic TZ3.  Since we didn't have time to research a lot on the web (we were on vacation) we relied on hands on tests and salesperson information.  We found this little shop that carried Panasonics and Fujis and the shop owner was a cool talkative guy.  He suggested this particular camera and we played around with it a bunch in the shop, talked it over, and figured we'd give it a shot and we bought one.  I especially liked the fact that it had Leica optics and overall it seemed quick and easy to use.Then we got out into the real world and started to take pictures of our kids, both inside and outside.  We were shocked by the purled tinges to the skin tones and just the \"off\" colors, not subdued or too \"punchy\", but \"off\".  We are Caucasian, and the pictures had botchy purple spots on our skin and gave my daughters' blonde hair a wicked red cast.  I messed with the color settings and other settings, but couldn't get decent skin tones.  I took around 60 pictures, being careful to make sure I was doing everything \"right\", but I couldn't get anything close to what I'd call realistic colors.We returned to the shop and the salesman printed out a couple pictures and they weren't as bad as on the screen, but still the skin tones looked washed out.  He tried to say it was because of the poor light outside due to it being cloudy, and even told me I had a lot of purple in my face (?!?!).  He also said I'd need to play with the White Balance to get good pictures (not true on all but the first digital camera I bought in 1999).  I asked if it was the screen, or this particular camera and he said the camera was working fine.  So I told him I couldn't use this camera and he fortunately refunded our money.Since we got home, I started doing some research and haven't found too many complaints on the web about this.  But we've been going to a lot of cameras stores back here at home and every copy of this model seems to have this issue.  I'm writing this to warn any others out there that might be thinking of this camera.

I wouldn't doubt that my heavily used TZ3 will last a very long time, and I strongly recommend it to ANYONE who is new to digital photography, or who just wants an inexpensive, but fantastic camera.The camera has too many pros, so I'll go over the best ones:-10x optical zoom (and 40x digital) is fantastic-strong and enduring (my camera has been spelunking, hiking, snow-skiing, to the beach, nearly under waterfalls, and dropped on the ground several times)-Starry-night mode (15, 30, and 60 second shutter times for nighttime photos)-(Also, fireworks mode.

A newer edition of the camera is now available which allows for high definition photos and movies but obviously requires a MUCH larger memory card. The used camera I recently purchased through Amazon was to replace the TZ3 I already had but which developed problems with the battery contacts such that it wouldn't power up (I since discovered that if I used a shim to push the batteries in further, the batteries would make contact) and I have now found the same problem with the replacement. I would have upgraded to the TZ5 model or better but my friend has one (very satisfied with it) and we found that our underwater housings were not interchangeable so I would also have to buy a new housing if I upgraded my camera (not very nice of Panasonic to do that). All in all, I have taken thousands of photos and movie clips with the camera and found it very reliable and easy to use until the battery problem. The TZ3 has a high quality 10X optical zoom which is very nice and clear but does not allow active zoom while in the movie mode like the TZ5 does. The camera is compact and fits in a shirt pocket with no exposed lens when powered off but is more solidly built and heavier than many newer cameras.

I carry it in my pocket for use at all times, at work, at home, everywhere. I used it instead of a scanner for reproducing old photos, especially at other peoples homes. I captured documents at 7Mp for archiving or for pasting into reports. I have used the full zoom range for amazing landscape shots as well as a recent Julio Iglesias concert from 50 yards with both video and still shots.I mostly leave the camera in the 'intelligent mode' with image and motion stabilization and disable the flash.I have taken night shots of the Tokyo cityscape, and night shots of the winterscape in upstate New York which I may not have even tried offhand with other cameras. With the image and motion stabilization, a lack of a tripod did not cost me a stellar photo.The camera has some limitations. The shutter does lag a fraction of a second so some shots are missed when there is movement or a facial expression changes. The flash sometimes flattens the image because it is different from the ambient lighting, in which case it is better to turn it off or change the mode to slow flash with ambient lighting. This is when it often pays to drag out the old Canon digital SLR with the faster shutter lag and the better vertical flash position.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Zoom Feature!", "Author": "Garden Hoe \"Boom\"", "ReviewID": "R1TQZ1AHWPA83W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife was due for an upgrade after carrying around her thin Kodak digital camera for 3 years.

First, there are no manual settings.  Second, noise reduction is heavy handed, producing poor photos with ISO 400 and up.

In addition, the camera is easy to carry and the 3\" screen makes for easy framing and viewing.But...there is room for improvement.  The biggest one being, in moderate to low light the image quality suffers from pixel noise (colored artifacts) that are clearly visible especially in the shadow areas.  Also, I have found that it is very easy to accidently change the setting on the round dial on the top of the camera.  It would be helpful if their was a locking feature to keep the setting in place.  Battery life could be better too.Overall, a great package and if you are using the camera for 4x6 prints, the digital noise may not be apparent but once you go larger on your prints, it's there.Perfection would be a bigger, less noisy sensor, some weatherproof against water and locking dials and better battery life.

This camera has received a better test results regarding the speed shooting pictures in sequence. It is therfore alos good snap shot camera, but much more than this. Read more: It does not take a long time compared to other cameras to charge, focus and take a wonderful shot. It shoots brilliant picutes although the flash is super bright. It does not have manual features, but many many programs from which you can choose of for almost every surrounding the right setting is available. Also, you have two buttons you can \"pre-set\"with your favourite settings so it is super simple to handle.The \"only\" 7.x megapixels are just fine they match to the chip that is inside the camera and that's the important part somebody told me. All pixels should have room on that chip to produce the best quality of pictures - which this camera really does.But the best part is the super zoom, 10x and an additional digital zoom, also it has some neat functions like the \"hold still button\" not sure what the correct term is, but it prevents the camera or rather the image on the screen from shaking, you take quick, excellent, high resolution shots! Yeah, I love that camera, I put a fast SD-HD card inside, 4 GB so that I can use the \"burst function\" as well, many pics I can shoot in quick sequence. It looks nice and helps when you do a photo story.Well, I could say much more positive things and only positive things this thing is great, remember you cover even a 28mm angle (wide angle).Hey, if there are more of these \"old\" cameras on the market - go get one, the new typse not necessarily have to be better- remember this.

You can play around with some of the adjustments and get a decent picture, but sometimes that isn't useful since by the time you make the ajustments the picture may be gone!  Not to mention, if it is truly low light it can be hard to see the screen to make the necessary adjustments...Overall I have to agree with most of the other reviewers and give this product 5 stars based on my experience with the other point and shoots I have owned.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Consumer Reports rates very high", "Author": "RMcC \"\"Smiley\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3NH7NSN758PUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched digital cameras on Consumer Reports and they rated this Panasonic Lumix very high.

The only blemish was a scratch running down the left-hand side of the lcd glass which is completely invisible when the camera is on and the screen is lit.  Other than that there is no way to tell this wasn't completely new.The camera itself is the best point-and-shoot I have seen.  It is a little on the heavy and bulky side so if size and weight are your main consideration for buying a camera then pass this by.  But it is so heavy and bulky because of the amazing lens:  10x optical zoom (up to 40x digital) and 28mm equivalent wide-angle, which may be even more impressive than the zoom.  There are plenty of cameras out there from other manufacturers that offer the same or in some cases better than 10x optical zoom, but I don't believe any of them offer wide angle as well, especially not for this price!The camera also has 21 special shooting modes like candlelight, starry sky, sports, baby, etc. and \"intelligent\" auto mode that does a pretty good job of picking the right settings for the environment without having to switch to the special modes.  All very easy to pick up and use.  Add to that really good video and you have in my mind the ultimate point-and-shoot digital camera.  I bought an 8gb memory card to go with it and I can now shoot over 2100 pictures or 28 minutes of uninterrupted video.  My only real problem right now is I misplaced the battery charger!

The last one was the Nikon S9, which my wife dropped and smashed the LCD screen.  The Panasonic out performs the Nikon in almost every way.  The only thing I prefer about the Nikon S9 is that it's truly a \"Super Compact\" camera, easily fitting in a pocket.  The Panasonic is still small, but not nearly as small as the Nikon.I have a Nikon D50 DSLR as my main camera, so this one we mostly got for snapshots and the movie mode.  We love taking little movies of our baby boy, and it's so much easier to use this little thing than to lug out our tape-based camcorder.  It's also so much easier to import the movies onto the computer with this.  One great feature about the movie mode on this camera is that it gives the option to shoot in widescreen format, which is really nice.  The sound on the movies isn't great, but it's good enough for us.  One minor gripe is that you can't zoom once you're recording a movie, but it's not a deal breaker... just a minor annoyance.As for the photo mode, it's got image stabilization, which is great!  Our old Nikon S9 would consistently blur low-light photos without the flash, where as this one does very well in low light.  The images can get kind of grainy due to the high ISO in low light, but that usually doesn't bother us.  Like I said, we mostly use it for snap shots.  The camera has a whole bunch of scene modes, but we don't really use them.  And I'm not convinced that they really improve your pictures much.  I'm partial to the Intelligent ISO mode, since it's easy and does a nice job in low light.  The 10x zoom is great.  It's one of the things that helped me decide on this camera over another.One other random thing I love about this camera is that the battery charger doesn't have a cord, it just plugs straight into the wall.  I know, it's minor, but it's really nice not to have a long cord getting in the way.It took a long time for me to make a decision here.  It was between this one and the FujiFilm F50.  The Fuji is famous for it's bigger CCD chip and outstanding low-light performance.  But one review said that the movie mode on that one wasn't so great, and we wanted this camera as much for the movie mode as for still pictures.  So that's why I ultimately decided on this one.All-in-all, a great little camera.  If you're looking for a camera to make great art photography, spend the money and get a DSRL.  But if you want an easy little camera for snapshots and movies, this is the one for you!", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "almost went Casio, but I'm pleased", "Author": "D.

I carve small, intricate netsuke out of wood and recycled 80 year old ivory and these have been almost impossible to photograph, even with some very expensive cameras. With the intelligent ISO and anti-shake this is a doddle. The results are stunning. I bought a spare battery with the camera but haven't noticed that I have to change batteries all that often. The other big plus about this camera is the amazing zoom. I have even tried taking it to its limit with the digital zoom, giving a remarkable 60 times at 3MP and the quality is surprisingly good.

The deciding factor for me was the quality of the video the TZ3 (please note: _video_, not including the audio).Great:The lens and the zoom. Especially considering that the camera is still quite compact, it's incredible. Very little lens distortion/artifacts and the 10x zoom is awesome.Movie mode is great -- very good quality (it records Quicktime .MOV files); the audio is actually pretty good except for the ticking (see below). Many similar cameras use rather destructive compression algorithms for recording video and, in NV10's case, the smearing and blooming was simply terrible. The TZ3 of course has some of the same problems but they're much, much, much less noticeable.Good:Image quality is pretty good. 7MP is plenty for me (I had the 10MP NV10 before but honestly it was a terrible 10MP camera and a pretty good 7MP one).Micro-USB: I don't know why Panasonic decided to put a microUSB instead of a more common miniUSB port on this camera... there's plenty of room. Also, the camera does not charge its battery from the USB port, which should be a default feature at this point.Size/Packaging: quite a fatty compared to the NV10 and clearly feels less sturdy, but actually OK. Both cameras break quite easily when abused (I learned this the hard way..). Get a case.Bad:No manual control what-so-evah.\"Movie\"-function audio: there's an internal mechanical ticking noise that gets picked up by the mic. The source is quite a mystery considering that the camera doesn't allow for zooming while filming and that the noise remains even if the movie-autofocus (?!.. not sure if this actually does anything) and stabilization features are turned off.

The zoom and the 28mm wide angle was the decision maker for me. Where else can you find such a powerful lens on a camera that fits in yer pocket?  The TZ3 is the only game in town. The operation is simple, and most importantly the photos are very, very good. If you don't want to fuss with manual settings and spend a long time learning how to them, and want an easy to use out of the box camera with some very fine features then I would highly recommend the TZ3.

While I will probably also buy a D-SLR compatible with my collection of Nikon lenses for serious photography, this is a super little camera to use every day and when you don't want to haul around a lot of heavy equipment. It fits neatly in my purse and hand, it has a solid feel (yes, it's heavier than some others, but I find that reassuring), the controls are logical, the zoom is great, and the picture quality is quite good. The screen is also large and relatively easy to read except in very bright direct sun, especially compared to the Nikon. As with any other camera, you have to experiment a bit to find what settings work best. In the week that I've had it, I've taken pictures of buildings, children, flowers, pets, and scenery and been pleased with my results. One interesting result of the experimentation: I found that the \"food\" setting works better with close-ups of flowers than the \"macro\" setting and I also found that the \"soft skin\" setting for portraits is great - my husband has rosacea and this setting really helped to create a flattering portrait with no Photoshop editing required (probably the best picture that he's had in years, including several taken by professionals).", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Superb Camera", "Author": "Mac W", "ReviewID": "R3HLGJH8T8FIIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A professional photographer told me about this camera.

In some pictures faces felt like someone used a smudge tool in photoshop because picture were not sharp at all but I am trying to figure out if it was cause by a user error.I was hoping that indoor and night time pictures result would be as good as canon, but that is not the case. Camera was slow while I took night time pictures. I will get high speed memory card and play with flash and light settings and hopefully result is better then what it is right now.Overall, I like this camera. Best features are 1) Zoom range with image stabilizer 2) screen size 3) battery life 4) ease of useVideo is good quality but hard to change its settings.

It's a great camera, I'll give you that, but I think you can get similar quality with another brand and newer model. I am most disappointed with it's short life. It worked great while I had it until I had it on my tripod. I knocked it over on the CARPET and it dropped in slow motion. It barely hit the ground and managed to jam the lens in. I did every suggestion online. I even took the camera and lens apart. It won't budge. It's $160 to fix so I thought it'd be the same price to buy a new one. It's not. My conclusion?

These are easy to set and simple to use for photos.The 12X zoom brings objects close but you'll need to practice a light touch to get the amount of zoom correct. The ability to take photos in low light without flash is impressive but beware that the trade-off is a photo with significantly lower resolution.Overall a great feature rich camera at a competitive price.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "panasonic lumix", "Author": "Dr. Michael Harris \"mike\"", "ReviewID": "R3FPC61O9Z7WIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is a bit more bulky than my old optio but the excellence of the lens and the 10 times zoom makes up for it.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Swapna Mathulla", "ReviewID": "R3GKYNG3135VPG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This cam is pretty good for the price....not very sleek though...the picture quality and zoom is great....", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just fine", "Author": "Z.

So when TZ2/TZ3 came out with the automatic lens cover, I thought perhaps it's great enough an improvement to be worth trading up to.  Well, the automatic lens cover is great, the slightly smaller size (comparing to TZ1) is nice, and the larger 3-inch LCD screen (again, comparing to TZ1's 2.5-inch) is wonderful, especially with the nifty new feature to display any 2 pictures of your choosing at once.  HOWEVER, since the optical zoom now starts at 28mm wideangle, the highest zoom is only 280mm instead of 350mm!  280mm is the equivalent of 8X zoom on any camera that does not start at wideangle, so the \"10X\" claim is very misleading.  Sure the little bit of wideangle is nice to have, but in my opinion, it's not worth sacrificing this much zoom-in ability for, especially since the main attraction about this camera model is the HIGH ZOOM in a relatively small package!Added 5/3:Not that I care, but I feel a little amused by the number of negative feedbacks and comments I got on this particular review.  Apparently I've touched a nerve since this is a very likable camera.  I profess that I like the TZ3 very much too and it was a hard decision to return it.  But folks, face the facts and the hard numbers.  280mm is less zoom than 350mm.  I am not accounting TZ1's or TZ3's ability to do \"higher zoom\" by reducing the resolution (I'd rather take the full resolution picture and crop it myself later), but only accounting for each camera's full optical zoom at each camera's maximum resolution.  Whether or not wideangle is more important to you than higher zoom is a matter of preference - I'm just pointing out (as the manufacturer fails to), that even though it's nice that TZ3 now has wideangle, there IS a trade off, which is the LESSER ZOOM capability.To illustrate, I have uploaded 4 pictures.  They are the 280mm (TZ3 at maximum zoom in) vs. the 350mm (TZ1 at maximum zoom in), and the 28mm (TZ3 at maximum zoom out) vs. the 35mm (TZ1 at maximum zoom out).", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "So-so camera", "Author": "Frank J.

I might have rated it less, based on the following problem: I LOVE my little camera, except for one thing - it lacks a viewfinder, and that is a problem with the TZ3 also. This may not seem like much, but it is, especially if you use reading glasses. Using the  LCD screen alone, one needs to constantly switch back and forth between \"no glasses,\" to see the view, and \"glasses,\" to see the screen. This would not be such a problem if it had a viewfinder, in which case one could take photos without donning one's reading glasses! And without having to switch back and forth.I gave it a 4 star rating because otherwise, it is outstanding! The Leica lens is superb, the amount of telephoto/wide angle range is great, and, although my TZ1 is only 5 MP, that is quite adequate for most purposes, even for 8X10 blow-ups, and 7.2 as provided in the TZ3 must eliminate most theoretical issues with resolution and sharpness.One other issue I have is with the very extensive descriptive material on the Amazon web site. It NEVER gives the exact name of the lens, making it difficult to impossible to determine whether it is the same lens that is in my camera, or not! It sounds like the same lens, but I cannot be sure.One other little issue is that apparently this camera is far from shockproof. I suspect, based on the info in the manual, though I haven't broken mine yet, that it is rather delicate. If it WERE at least shock resistant, it would be a whole order of magnitude more desirable, in MHO.Anyway, if this camera, and its siblings had a viewfinder, and were a bit (maybe a lot?) tougher, I don't think there's another digital camera out there that could touch it for less than $400.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "Dawn Michaels", "ReviewID": "R3J71P3JQCPPRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so excited about this camera - it has all the bells and whistles and is so easy to use.", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Beware-no viewfinder!", "Author": "J.
