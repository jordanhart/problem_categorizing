This camera, however (the DMC-FP5), is not that great. Sure, the exterior looks pretty (I love pink), but the quality of the pictures are less than stellar, and having everything touchscreen is actually a lot more annoying that I had expected. When going through the options for setting up the photos (beach-mode, portrait, cloudy, candlelight, etc.), the camera does not tell you what option you are selecting nor does it give you a preview until you have already selected it, so if you are unsatisfied, you'd have to go back into the menu and select another one. If I had known the DMC-FP5 would be like this, I would've just purchased a Sony or another Canon.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor quality plastic parts : ( disappointing", "Author": "Jacqueline Diamond \"Quasi-SuperStar\"", "ReviewID": "RP9V0DV1EE5JV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased for my daughter as a b'day present, because I had a similar one myself that she loved and would always ask to borrow, so I knew she was going to love this, and she did!... until it stopped working. As you can see, I have not given this many stars but that's not because it doesn't take great pictures, it definately takes beautiful pictures. It's compact and light, and it's pink! How perfect is that for a 13 year old girl!?! So we were very excited for her to open her b'day present and start taking pictures!...But here is the downside -- cheap plastic parts.  Within a week of owning it, we had problems. I was removing the battery to recharge it, and the little plastic clip that holds the battery in place just snapped off!!! I couldn't believe it!!! It was so flimsy, and I've never had that problem with my own Lumix, so I have since wondered if we didn't receive a faulty camera that perhaps had a crack in the plastic or something when we received it. As a result, now the battery does not lock firmly in it's place because there is nothing to hold it, so it just moves loosely around inside the camera, and the only way to take pictures with it is to either flip it upside down and let gravity help you, or try to apply firm enough pressure right where the battery is that it pushes it to make a connection.  It's so annoying now that we hardly use it ; (  Instead our pretty pink camera just sits on the shelf most of the time.  It would have been perfect, but the parts are poor quality.... very disappointed.Also, I have another Lumix camera that is similar, and it would be a great thing if they could share a battery charger, but they are slightly different which means you need to always bring both chargers with you when traveling... Lumix, you should streamline your parts and produce better quality clips! Plastic parts are not going to cut it!  It's such a shame because the picture quality is sensational!In summary:Pro's -- Beautiful picture quality, sharp images, rich intense colors, great clear action shots, lightweight, small, easy to take with you anywhere.Con's -- Plastic parts that break almost immediately, poor capacity to withstand regular use, battery charger not interchangeable with other compact digital Lumix cameras.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Iggy Alchemie \"wa~\"", "ReviewID": "R1L1RLFDYEAMJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what I needed from a point and shoot. works well and takes good pictures and video, battery lasts long and I love that it  is a rechargable!!!", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "beautiful design", "Author": "AmraS", "ReviewID": "ROMZVK2QJUAMN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera as a camera is good, no more to say.. take pictures, and the quality is really good, but if u want to use it in all its potential, u should know a bit of photography", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "sheldon williams", "ReviewID": "R2BS1D3YYEEMNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is just wat I was looking for  in a cheap  camera  grate value for  money don't be afraid  to get one  people", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.00", "Features": "14.1-megapixel resolution\n4x optical image-stabilized zoom; iA mode\n3-inch touch-screen LCD; Smart Touch Screens feature\n720 HD video capture; LUMIX Image Uploader makes it simple to share pictures on Facebook and video on YouTube\nCapture images and video to  SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP5 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ma7htqI-L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004HW7K9G"}}
