Probably helps that I'm only about a 3 hour drive from the shipper.  Hooked it up and initially thought it was DOA.  But it wasn't the DVR comes locked and you have to hold the REW key for 5 sec to unlock the mouse and remote.  I got it on the network and through the router (NAT) in just a few minutes.  It's very easy to setup.  The Android software from Zmodo's website didn't work.  But in the tech section it recommends IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chou from the Android Market, it works great.  Just add a DVR, make=zmodo Model=Zmodo H9106 w/Media Port and all should be good. Repeat for each of the channels you use on the DVR.  There is also a version available from Amazon [...] but it's not updated as often.  I've only used the ActiveX web software so far on the PC.  It came with a mini-CD with software but I haven't installed it yet.Now for the bad.1. No Macintosh support (but it does have iOS support).  I contacted Zmodo and got a response within an hour!  They are working on Mac support but don't have a release date yet.  So if you only have Mac's or *Nix I would look elsewhere for now.  But if you have a Windows PC it's easy to setup and works great.2. Hard drive was loose in the DVR!  When I unboxed it I could feel something sliding around in the DVR.  I pulled the cover off and the Hard Drive was just sitting in there.  It was hooked up to the cables but no screws.  There's even a sticker that tells you where to install the screws.  In the bag with the remote and manuals there was a tiny bag with the 2 missing screws.  I installed them fired it up and everything was OK.  I guess they come from china without the hard drives and whoever installed it was in a hurry.  It came with a Western Digital Blue series Hard Drive (not the AV series as far as I can tell) but I'll have to look again at the exact model I got.If the Hard Drive wasn't loose in the DVR then it would have had a 5 star review.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money!", "Author": "Eric W", "ReviewID": "R176JSHBF4BKK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because my car has been broken into 3 times in less than 2 months. If I had the money, I would obviously be living in a better neighborhood. Therefore, I was looking for something cheap yet effective!No HDD(SATA) was a perfect savings for me since I had a couple drives laying around. The framerate is pretty great on the cameras. Switching from color to IR is quite seamless. The GUI isn't the sexiest out there, but it does the job well. To save some head-scratching for others, when you first power up, go straight to the \"alarms\" menu. I turned off HDD, Motion, and I/O alarms to stop the incessant beeping. Then go to \"device\" to format the HDD. NTFS and FAT32 apparently are not what it is looking for. Email notifications and web-access are surprisingly brilliant for a system that is this cheap.So whether you need to catch the person that is stealing your garden gnomes, or you are filming Paranormal Activity 4 (creepy glowing eyes), it's a pretty good deal! Wish me luck on catching the bad guys!", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent low end model, cameras could be better", "Author": "J.

The cameras are ehh in quality.  They dont have great night vision and sometimes during the day the picture greys out, but the DVR is excellent, and the software is simple, and intuitive.I'd buy this kit again, and supplement with better cameras. DVR is superb!", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "ZMODO DVR with Cameras", "Author": "aptpath", "ReviewID": "R8UEQLKI9NQBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am enjoying my new DVR with cameras. Hook up was easy but I have done this a few times; however, the instruction sheets shipped with the product were so small that 5 people could not read the print or see the figures. I have yet figured out how to connect from my mobile phone and I hate calling tech support, but I may have to. I would recommend this product to all who do not want to spend big bucks.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for :-)", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "RH4J4YM798P1D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wasn't expecting great things, so I'm not too disappointed.Most of the reviews here on Amazon concerning Zmodo equipment are accurate.The cameras are pretty low quality. They don't capture color correctly. Right now my cameras think green leaves and green grass are supposed to be shades of pink and purple. I'm not sure why this happens. It captures most colors correctly and it can't be corrected with hue settings. The problem exists at the cameras and nowhere else.If you expect to read a license plate on a car, think again. I have one of my cameras right now facing a cars rear end, roughly 20 to 30 feet away. The license plate is impossible to read. I actually tried holding up an old license plate in front of one of my cameras. 10 to 15 feet max. Beyond that the large letters of a license plate are illegible. That should give you some idea of what to expect from these cameras. Faces also become unidentifiable blobs at a distance. One of my cameras points to my front door, and it's close enough that I can identify someone I know. If it's someone I don't know, I won't have much luck finding out who it is, and the camera isn't going to represent the correct color of their clothing either. Not going to help much if the video gets turned over to the cops.At some point I will have to upgrade the cameras.The includee wire seems like a good deal, but take a good look at what you get. We have video and power all in one very small jacket. The size of the wire inside that jacket is probably very small and I bet it's stranded. Won't take much to break so you need to be very careful when pulling your wire. I managed to pull mine without breaking, but I am experienced in pulling wire. At some point it's probly going to make more sense to pull new coax with BNC connectors and use the existing wire for power only. Especially when upgrading cameras. We will see how the wire holds up over time.The DVR itself isn't so bad. The software is a little wonky but for a home DVR it is acceptable. As long as it holds up over time I think the DVR may be the best part of the purchase. I believe the DVR might be capable of recording a higher quality of video than what the included cameras can provide.My DVR also came with a USB mouse. It has some spare pieces clanking around inside... so that's going in the trash. I also received a remote for my DVR. I have not attempted to use the remote yet.All in all this is not a terrible DVR/camera system. I would recommend it more for indoor use considering the limitations of the cameras. If you need real outdoor surveillance, you will need better cameras.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice.", "Author": "Anonymous User", "ReviewID": "RD1IJQ5G1AINH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cheap. SERIOUSLY. I priced around and this was the cheapest w/HD. My friends still trip out about the price for two reasons:1) it INCLUDED the HD.2) 8CH not a 4CH.Great. Wish the resolution was better at night, but it's great all around.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "worked great right out of the box", "Author": "Tanya", "ReviewID": "R1OLJE2NNP9K6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hooked this system up for our shop yesterday, and it worked great straight out of the box.  We also purchased four other Zmodo wide angle cameras for inside, and they all connected great.  Quality was plenty fine for what we were looking for, and even the infrared view after you turn the lights out is good.  I know some reviewers said that they had hooked the cables backwards, I'm not sure how.  If you manage to hook these cables backwards you have more problems than just that, probably also have trouble tying your shoes, as there was only one way to hook them up.  Also, some reviewers said that the menu is not very intuitive.  I've used several security systems over the years, and all the menus are kinda laggy and slow, but this one is about as easy to use as any.  Main menu, camera views, date/time setup.... not that hard to figure out!  At least I thought.  Anyway, for the price it can't be beat.  We haven't hooked up to the internet yet, so I can't review that part of the system.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good System", "Author": "Junior111", "ReviewID": "R3LZ92RZ4GTVR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this system a few months ago. It was relatively easy to set up and I found out that you have to first format the build-in hard drive to keep it going. I played around with different settings, including 'masking' portions of a camera view in order to prevent excessive motion alarms. However the system is so sensitive that a tree swaying in the wind can trigger alarms, and I turned that function off.The cameras that came with the system are not the greatest, especially at night, but I knew that before I bought the system. For those areas which are important to my safety and security I bought some 600TVL CCD (NOT CMOS!!) cameras with at least 36 IR LED's and those are perfectly fine for  good night vision pictures.I never hooked the system up to any internet connection, so I have no expertise about these functions. But as a stand-alone system with 8 cameras it is a great system for the price.  If you can't decide whether to buy a 4 or 8 camera DVR - take the 8 camera version. The price is virtually the same but with the option of having up to 8 cameras installed you will at least feel more of in command when you just look at your live 8-split screen and KNOW where  'that awful noise\" came from on the outside. When it comes to ANY cameras you use - spiders LOVE the IR lights and start adorning it with their webs. Make sure you have a long-handled feather-duster to keep the cameras free of cob-webs or it defeats its purpose of seeing who is out there.  The ONLY vulnerable part of the entire system are the cables that come with the included cameras. They are very thin and are easily damaged to the point of uselessness. DON'T staple these cables with a powerful stapler. I first taped the cables along their route to the camera to fit their length and then used appropriate plastic cable-holders to keep them in a fixed position. After that is done (takes some time) you can sit back and relax. Once the system is up and running with an upgraded set of good cameras you will wonder how you ever got along without it before. Besides - it really gives you peace of mind to go back in time on any camera angle and see for sure who stole your garden gnomes at 3:41 a.m.All in all - I'm happy with the system and would very much recommend it.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expected to pay more", "Author": "JudoYodan", "ReviewID": "R28U9EHMIH452B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system went in and fired up relatively easily.

For the price this is great! I didn't expect perfect at the price I paid.  Lets say I got this because we have unsavory rental neighbors & this is added protection. Its a decent picture & night vision is okay.It would identify people for sure & has a wider picture scan than as stated in a previous review.  You will get a large area with every camera.  The system itself is wired which is what I wanted. To view on the internet - NOTE (This is not wireless it will need to be hard wired to view on the internet.) If you want audio, you need to buy additional cameras. Zmodo told me no kits have any sound. For those 2 reasons, it only gets 3 stars instead of 4.UPS delivered it to the people we want our property protected from. We were lucky to get this package at all.
