It is very easy to use. The instruction book is extremely clear - this helps make every aspect of the camera come to life in a enjoyable fashion. This aspect is oftem overlooked by many manfactures. It has full USB capability ! The software is easy to use and works on Windows 2000 Professional. The Polaroid printer is the nicest part of all. You can crop and improve your photos of the LCD before you print them. It uses Polaroid 500 Film which is widely available i.e. the same film for the Joy Cam and Captiva models. The color and picture quality is beautiful. The Digital camera is a gem as well! Polaroid's lastest color films are vibrant in color and clear. It is a real hit with my family!", "Date": "January 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "almost two much", "Author": "Jerry l.

Is that is bulky and a little awkward and sometimes the polaroid feature will not ejecta photo. For a buisness camera its nice for a family camera it needs a little work one other draw back if you use the polaroid feature alot make sure you have lots of batteries because it is very hard on them. Rechargable one's are the only way to go. It also will take upto 20seconds of video, the digital pic's are very clear and print out on a good photo printer as good as any film camera.

The ones that have a simple telephoto built in, auto-exposure, you get the drift, a simple to use, under 100buck one.  I started looking for a digital camera because I am a gadget nut, and this went right along with my interest in computers and always having aleast a showing of the newest inovations. I did some reading, not to much, and listened to others as to what to look for, and the price.  Well, when all was said and done, I still had no idea what I wanted or needed or could afford.  One day, just by chance, I saw the Olypus C-211 in a store. I started reading the info on the box, well, knowing what little I did know, it sounded easy enough to use and advanced enough to play with. It looked great on the box, and the outside info was enough to convince me that I had done my homework and this was the camera for options and the price.  Ok, the old saying to good to be true, isnt always true. This is the exception. It does a great job for those of us that want good pictures, better than my film camera. It has alot of the bells and whistle you might be looking for, low-to-high resolution pictures, short mpg movies, zoom, flash and a whole lot more that I still am learning.  The one or two draw backs to this camera, or at least the package I got, was the memory-card wasnt really enough, so I bought an extra 128mb card. I also had to buy a hidride battery charger. These two items cost about another 100 dollars, but well worth the investment.  There are two main drawbacks to me, one being not so bad, the other is what I consider a major one. The first being size and weight. It is about 4x7 in. in size and wieghts alittle over one pound, both acceptable, seing as it is also an instant camera for those who want pictures now. These are small, and the film isnt the best, but sufficient for everyday need.  The one major drawback to me, is the cost of the film for the instant camera side of the Camera. But, again, you dont use it all that much, but it is convenient to have.  All and all, this is a great camera for all around digital use, not a real high-end, nor a low-end camera. It does a great job at 2.11 megapixels and all the little built-in tricks.  Well, that about does it for this persons opinion, Thanks for reading this and do your homework.", "Date": "December 31, 2001"}, {"Title": "Big and bulky, but still cool", "Author": "Jon D.

Its so versatile...  I love Polaroid 500 pics anyway...so this was neat because it is a digital cam along with the OPTION of polaroid *quick* prints.

I have never been able to achieve the color clarity as well as the detail that this camera can produce--even in ambient lighting situations that are not so camera-friendly. I have uploaded pics to my pc as well as taken the smartcard to the camera shop to have them printed out. It was really easy and took only a minute for either function. At the camera shop, I selected the views that I wanted and had them printed to CD since I knew their equipment was color calibrated far better than mine! (you can tell I'm obsessive about color--for an amateur). The quality of the print was so excellent that my photographer husband thought that it was taken with a 35 mm. Ya' gotta' love it. I also used the polaroid print function and found the color to be excellent in that respect as well. The nice big preview screen on the back is great and can also be used for framing shots.Since I prefer a \"sturdy\" camera, the relative bulk of this camera doesn't bother me a bit! The super light cameras tend to \"fly away\" on me, and I'm never sure that what I wanted was what I shot.(Guess I'm getting old!) Very nice camera with excellent optics. I sold my other fancy digital camera to buy this one...Good move on my part!!!", "Date": "August 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good camera but software problems.", "Author": "Robert N.

I did think the size of the camera was bulky but you do get use to it.

Before this, I used a Fugi MX 1200.  There is 1 thing that I wish it had an optical viewfinder.  It can be hard to see in the sunlight.  As for size, its big because it has a built in printer.  I found an ac adapter at a ... chain store and use it with the camera.  The cost was less than [money]. The pics are quick b/c you are downloading via usb.  I use this camera with my MGI Family Ed. Photo program.  I also use 2 online photo sites that I found on the net.  They are snapfish and ofoto.  Wow, was I surprised when I received some pics back that I had sent on the net.  I experimented with 1 photo and had it blown up to an 8x10 size.  Everyone was amazed at the quality of this picture.  I use rechargable batteries and keep several smart media cards handy all in my camera bag.  I am in charge of our Family reunions and I think that this camera will be ideal for this.  It gives family members a chance to pick up film and have a picture to keep if they want too.  The film is around [money] for 10 pics or [money] for 20 pics.  This camera seems to be well made.  I was happy with the Fugi but I was ready to move on to more pixals and I wanted to get an optical zoom.  This camera had both and the price was right since I found it on special for [money] b/c it had an instant [money] rebate.  To get anything near this camera without the built in printer would have cost over [money] more.  Again, i'm thrilled and it's simple to use with a little bit of reading the book and practice.  I print pictures out on my Hewlett Packard model 920 c printer with the resolution set up to 2400 by 1200.  Using photo paper or brochure paper can make your picture worth framing.  And a laminater can preserve your photos.  I also make picture cds on my cd burner to save and use later.  As you can tell, I am really into these electronic gadgets now and I research everything that I can about these new products.", "Date": "June 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Love it and it will love you back", "Author": "E.

Yes, it looks like a suitcase, and just try whipping one out now next to a guy with a digital camera the size of a microchip, but the heck with them! This camera is a modest little workhorse, and has been churning out crisp and beautiful photos for me since the moment I picked it up. Considering it's age, it even has a few bells and whistles, including a nice little zoom, a short movie mode, a neat white board and black board effect, and a decent macro mode for it's class. And most excellently, though I had had precious little experience with digital cameras before, I did not even have to glance at the manual to figure it all out.The polaroid pictures are not of the best quality (it's the digital pictures that show the c-211 to it's best advantage), but it's a handy feature, especially if your job requires documentation, and immediate hardcopies of documentation. Or just to impress your friends and justify the fact that your camera is the size of a lunchbox.As point and shoots go, particularly ones that were introduced so long ago, this kid was all I wanted, up until I dropped it, and it skidded across some concrete for a while--which I don't recommend. It's a great choice for a beginner with a limited amount of money to spend who wants to make sure they have decent quality photos. A used or refurbished camera (mine was) won't set you back very much (mine was @160.00 almost 3 years ago). Yes, it's a little on the heavy side, and people may laugh, but the C-211 will work it's little heart out for you.Until you drop it...", "Date": "December 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R15STPYJHL1SV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I entered digital photography very reluctantly, and only when I found the C-211 that would also make prints.
