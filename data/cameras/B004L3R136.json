The touchscreen works well with fingers as wellas the included stylus (i put it on the hand strap for easy access) The stylus works good when logging into facebook, youtube, photobucket and the many other available places to share your photos. I uploaded a picture to facebook with relative ease.I liked the auto backup too, you can backup your pictures to a Pc without connecting the camera to the Pc (awesome!!)The picture quality is great too!The video mode supports HD 720p i havent tried it yet but its HD! I suggest this camera to anyone looking for an easy to use point and click camera with some kick ass extras like the ability to touch up / edit photos before u send them on their way to FB or wherever you send them!", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Still has Work to Do", "Author": "thirdnormal", "ReviewID": "R38QEMYAOHBRL2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and used it extensively on a two week trip to Europe. Overall I am happy with it, it took great pictures and was pretty easy to use.I LOVE the fact that you can charge the battery without taking it out of the camera (Like the way you charge a cell phone). No need for a separate charger, so one less piece of gear to lug around. The benefit of this  also means you can charge it on an as-needed basis (I charged it through the power outlet in the rental car I was driving). This was the key feature that drove my purchase decision, and its strange that it doesn't get mentioned much in the marketing literature since it's a major advantage over the competition.The touch screen interface is a disappointment though. If you are used to a smart phone type touch screen then this screen will seem slow and clunky. It feels more like a PDA from 2004 than a smart phone from 2011. Also, putting all the controls on the touch screen makes for some usability issues. I would prefer to see physical buttons for commonly used operations like turning the flash on and off. A camera is a dedicated device so should be optimized for common photography use cases.The wireless connectivity was pretty cool, but again suffered usability issues. Connecting to wireless networks was a pain with the clunky touch screen. This is a long way from an iPhone or Android OS. Also, there doesn't seem to be any control over the name of the album or the subject of the facebook post. The wireless connectivity is is a very cool idea, but it still has some way to go before being truly compelling.At the end of the day I think my money was well spent. Samsung is on to a good thing and I hope they continue evolving this product line.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great potential held back by quirky software", "Author": "Clayton R.", "ReviewID": "R26R2RC9AD263D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received my SH100 today, so I won't try to do a full in-depth review. However, in the hours that I've played with it I can already tell that there are quite a few 'quirks' that seriously hinder an otherwise great camera.First, the camera comes with a touchscreen interface for most of the functions. Sadly, it also comes with a stylus which, in my experience, isn't optional to use in many situations (such as typing) - at least with my large fingers. Even worse - there isn't a place to store the stylus within the camera itself. Instead, it clips and hangs awkwardly from the lanyard. While a generally small nuisance (and perhaps a non-issue for those with smaller fingers), it would have been much nicer if the screen was sensitive enough to work via touch or there were discreet navigation buttons.The biggest issue for me, however, has to be the software running on the camera. The UI isn't very pretty and is awkwardly organized. It feels very hastily thrown together. Again, this is a minor disappointment, but something that should have been easy to fix. Unfortunately, that isn't all. The software is also quite buggy! I had found several issues within the first few minutes (where was the QC?!) which took hours to resolve. For one thing, logging in to Picasa was a real pain as there were issues with the software recognizing both my email address AND password. The login for Picasa should be the same as my Google login. However, my account is associated with several email addresses and only one of them was accepted for some reason (and it wasn't my normal gmail.com account, it was a tertiary address I rarely use). Even worse - there's a serious bug in the password handling that prevents it from recognizing a password with any special characters! As best I can tell, only numbers and letters will work as they should. If you enter a password with a special character the password will not be accepted. This was a real problem for me as I did not want to change my password (I use many different Google services across many devices, and changing the login credentials on all of them would be a real headache!) Fortunately, I discovered an undocumented workaround/hack. If you change special characters to URL encoding (so pa$$word becomes pa%24%24word) it will work (even though it really shouldn't!) Unfortunately, this seems to prevent the password from being stored properly (only characters up to the first % are stored!). So far I have only tried logging in to the Picasa service, but I suspect these issues are present in all password fields and may well extend to user names, etc.To be fair, the camera has some really great features and it takes very nice pictures for the price. In fact, it really could be an AMAZING camera if they ever get the software straightened out. Unfortunately, until new firmware is released, this camera has fallen fairly short of its potential.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upgrade your firmware!", "Author": "Daniel Holth", "ReviewID": "R3IIXZPBJ5PQ5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on the Engadget recommendation, because the camera records video in H.264 instead of the horribly inefficient motion JPEG, and for the cool WiFi feature. When it arrived I was impressed at how small it is but the menu system seemed to crash a lot or become unresponsive.It turns out this camera has a firmware update from July 29, 2011. I wasn't able to upgrade the firmware with the included (on the camera's internal storage) software; you should try to do it that way, but instead, I copied the contents of the firmware .zip to the root of the Micro SD card. After upgrading the firmware the camera's menu system is much more usable.Pros: Compact size, H.264 movie mode, never have to plug it into the computer to get the photos off due to the WiFi, large, bright touchscreenCons: Flash takes 5-10 seconds to charge after taking a photo, works best in outdoor light, doesn't use a standard USB cable", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Truly stands out", "Author": "Ruslan Moskalenko \"Ruslan Moskalenko\"", "ReviewID": "R16K8KIXCLSFPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My pretty daughter was looking for a little camera to take on her DC trip and obviously my big SLR was out of question. So we went to a store to do some shopping. I left her alone for a few mins and asked her to find something she likes. When I got back she said she chose this camera. Well, I told her she'd better check out Canons or Nikons because they are great cameras and who knows about Samsung. But I really got puzzled because I just couldn't convince her they are better. And after some thinking we ended up buying this Samsung camera.This camera is really special for 2 reasons.First is touchscreen. These days touch is the de-facto standard interface for mobile devices, so once you've tried a touchscreen camera it feels natural and going through menues with buttons really feels awkward. At one moment the Canon and Nikon menus became annoying. Yes, there is a stylus mostly for virtual keyboard but you can really get by with just fingers most of the times. So touchscreen does make big difference.Second is connectivity. The camera comes with Wi-Fi and it has built-in software to post pictures on facebook and some other popular services. And you can upload pictures wirelessly to your computer. No cables. This is a big deal.So is this camera a sure buy? Well, it's a bit more compicated. This camera is really trying to be a compromise between a \"real\" camera and a smart phone. In a \"real\" cameras land this camera is good but not the best. There are competitors out there with slightly better specs (like 1080HD instead of 720HD etc) but arguably you'll unlikely to notice a significant difference - any \"pro\" camera needs at least a bigger lense and heavier weight to capture a better image to begin with.Basically if you really like touchscreen and wireless you should seriously think if you'd rather buy a good smart phone. Yes, I can't think of any smartphone with 14MP, 5x Zoom, a 720p HD and a \"real\" flash, but does it justify carrying two devices? My daughter was saying that this is a big trip and she wants to capture the lifetime moments and she ended up with a smartphone and this camera (so hard to say no to an adorable daughter ...) but when we looked at the pictures she brought back, they are not really much different from her smartphone ones. So yes, with some skills you can do miracles with the camera but for most ordinary people and real life shots the results will be about the same. I mean you're unlikely to print a huge poster and a typical computer screen has <2MP anyway.So bottom line is, this is a good camera with some really outstanding features, it's really great feel and fun expirience, something making other competitors looks dull and boring. But if those new features make you so excited, you should consider a good smartphone, maybe that is what you really need.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "good and the bad and the reason why it misses being as close to perfect for a Point and Shoot", "Author": "J. Berger \"Liberals destroyed my education I ...", "ReviewID": "R2NT45FWWIOPB0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "OK I have a professional camera (canon rebel xs with the digic III proc)  I also have a Canon sd890is and three models before in the same series the 890 I could take a photo of someone closing their eyes in a great shot and take them from another as the photo quality was that good and paste them into the other with Photoshop.  THIS CAMERA has several issues above and beyond the image quality that make it less then ideal for a a serious photo snapper in a casual or serious environment.PROS:Body construction, nice  half powder coated steel have plastic but slim and durableLots of features (although most of which are not executed where the end result is a great picture)Macro Photo Quality:  GREAT super my Russian peterbald who is hairless to the naked eye actually as tiny tiny fuzz that is visible in a BROAD DAYLIGHT macro shot (not a dimly lit room shot)Self Portrait shots *lack detail and blur and auto correct only good for you know self shots not print quality or suchCONS: (and there are lots)due to the large size of the screen and no view finder so that you can turn it off and take photos that way to conserve battery like my old Cannon and new Canon Rebel xs, you are forced to hold the very small right side of the camera that has but one button and if you have large hands you will surely drop this camera unless you do the two hand photo taking thing.WHEN doing this:The camera heats up within 4 minutes that it is noticeable in a cold room so if it where summer or anywhere warm this would surely intensify, for the record, my canon sd890 which is years older and has a large battery and all powder coated steel frame would get this hot after HOURS OF USE not 4 minutes.TOUCH SCREEN:  The touch screen as some say is less responsive then current smart phones. However, it does work just find when you realize that to touch a menu you button you much touch dead center not the corner, the side, somewhere around it, you have to press it dead on and firmly not lightly.  That being said sometimes when you do it may or may not recognize the touch if you do it quickly it must be done slowly and firmly.VIDEO:  Testing in my room with natural light coming in from the window with my old camera and this one, the difference is 2011 and 1980, the video on this camera is  choppy at best my old old cell phone takes better video. That being said I did not test it outdoors in natural light and for that based on the cameras performance I am sure it would do fine fir most consumersPICTURE QUALITY:OK this is a multi part statement.Macro setting as stated above in natural bright light is excellentAuto Smart Setting aka what most refer to as just Auto, for lack of a better phrase sucks.  No matter what setting picture size the auto setting crops photos, lacks accurate consistent focus and is really bad on zoom as far as photo quality, I also tried the powershot elph 300 and even that had a better all around even though it was eh on the details in the photos and softened them.Night Mode: This mode has many settings but unless you have a VERY VERY VERY VERY steady hand or a tripod it is basically useless the photos come out blurred not in focus remotely or nothing distinguishable because you see the screen says processing complete and it wasn'tSelf Portrait Shots called Beauty Mode on the camera : Now if you want to take a photo of yourself and you want it to be a quality photo this is not the camera HOWEVER, if you have dry skin like I do on your face or a pimple and you take a photo of yourself with this camera YOU WILL NOT SEE ONE BLEMISH OR MARK! so if you are less then flawless bare face without makeup and need to send a guy or girl a shot of you then this is the camera you WANT!!!! however I can photoshop anything dont believe in being dishonest because the person will see you face to face without makeup eventually and you would have to explain what happened to your flawless complexion. WHen taking a face shot in beauty mode  it makes your skin look great but detail from hair and your eye color go the way of the dodo bird, again just in general not recommended unless you want to take photos without makeup and still look human.I have tried 4 2010-2011 point and shoot models 2 I got from Costco as that is where I bought all of my great performance point and shot cameras and then this being the 2nd from Amazon.  It seems to me that no matter what brand that any camera that has above 10 megapixels (which is sufficient for photo editing by the way as previously mentioned) that anything above this 10 Megapixel that combines with a digic 4 processor EVERY photo has lossssssssss of detail.I really want a point and shoot that I can carry around with me and also use indoors to take candids of my Russian Peterbalds and friends etc and video on the fly of my baby cousins that is good quality and I am desperate to find something of equal quality to my old canon powershot elph sd 890is or better as it is on it very last limbs from constant constant dropping lol, yet I am unable to find a suitable replacement that is equivalent or superior........:(", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy", "Author": "Jacob D Ford", "ReviewID": "R1HE81DMI1RJCM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera b/c of all the features described and i love the touch screen on my iphone.

It posts to facebook and all those other things pretty easily, but it does not remember your login info and you have to constantly type it in. the biggest problem I have had is that you can only send pictures set at 2MP so you cannot get the full use of the 14MP if you want to send them via the camera's built in WiFi. The other issue I have run into is that you CANNOT post to a company facebook page with the WiFi setting at all. Not sure where the software probelm is (it could be FB or the camera's) but you can only post to a personal FB account. Some more software developement and it will be the perfect point and shoot camera. One other thing is that the screen is a bit difficult to use because it is more of a press screen then a touch screen.

The charge speed of the flash was her first complaint...it does take a while for the flash to power up enough to discharge, so she missed a few shots she'd like to have had. The complexity of the menu structure was her next complaint. The thing is PLENTY configurable, but it's not very clear exactly what you're doing as you try to tune the various settings.

Problem is, I have a Mac and not Windows. So it was no good to me. Thank goodness I have IPhoto. You can go ahead and fix or edit your pics on the camera itself. But nothing is like having it on the screen of a laptop lookin at all the imperfections. It has this one Icon on the homescreen called Beauty Shot...very cool and wonderful for girls. HD video is a nice touch, and so is 14.2 megapix. For the price, gettin all of the bells and whistles in one lil package, really is great.

But there were so many steps to take, that I quickly abandoned that idea. For me, that was a dud.Next dud - all the different menus and options - I could never remember which button did what - and I take ALOT of pictures of food in restaurants - they almost always came out horrible. It would take forever to find the right \"setting\" (automatic was a joke - took horrible indoor shots). If I tried using the flash - all I got was a crappy shot that never did the food I was taking a picture of any justice.Now, taking outdoor pictures was usually always fine, no problems - until it started snapping blurry pictures - ALL THE TIME! Another Dud - I'd have to wait forever between a shot.The final dud - half the time it would turn on by itself if I tossed it in my purse because the ON/OFF button protrudes and it's easy to accidentally bump it.I finally gave in and bought a different camera (Sony Cybershot) which was cheaper and it is so EASY and takes 100% better pictures. I learned how to use that in about an hour whereas I spent a whole summer trying to learn how to use the Samsung until I finally gave up.I am not a techy/camera person - so perhaps I was doing something wrong - but if you are buying this and you are as \"clueless\" as I am, you might want to consider something else.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "You like your Android type Phones?

If you HAVE WiFi at home, do you need Boingo? Because Boingo Charges:Boingo Unlimited Enjoy unlimited Wi-Fi access throughout the Americas on any two Wi-Fi enabled devices for $9.95 each month.  Wi-Fi connections made outside the Americas will be billed an additional $0.12 or $0.18 per minute.  Boingo Unlimited is a recurring charge, but you can change your plan at any time.Boingo AsYouGo Enjoy 24 hours of Wi-Fi access on this device at this hotspot for $7.95. Plus, use your Boingo account to stay connected at hundreds of thousands of hotspots worldwide; prices vary by location.Boingo Global - Combo Enjoy up to 2,000 minutes of Wi-Fi access per month on your laptop or smartphone at Boingo hotspots worldwide for only $59 USD per month. Please note, this is a recurring subscription, but Boingo is flexible, so you can change your plan at any time.WHICH seems a BIT PRICEY TO ME. I guess I will find out!I'll update as I go. : )UPDATE: It's a poor first leap for Samsung. You will be lucky if you can ever figure out how to connect your home wifi to it. After the three free months of hotspot wifi, you'll need to pay 7.99 month. There is no drag and drop of picture files, so don't expect to be able to move them around on your computer. No Burn to Dvd or Cd capability. No instructions on how to do or set up much of anything. I've had it two weeks and haven't figured out how to be able to set up home wifi, Samsung is useless at replies, my phone company tech support helped as much as they could, but still Nothin. It's a great concept, but it's limited and impossible to figure out. You have to upload to Picasa to burn CDs and DVDs, it's a royal pain in the butt!!!

It connects to my WIFI network but it won't find the computer running the server.  The popup menus are difficult to understand, the error messages are useless and the support articles on the website are written by someone whose first language isn't English and they are also useless.  When you try to get the backup software connected to your WIFI network, it asks for the password for you network and even though it finds the network and connects, when it doesn't find your PC it boots you all the way back to the WIFI network setup so you have to type your passwords in again.  Great, my password is long and difficult to type on the unresponsive touch screen and there is no way to see if you are typing your passwords in correctly and sometimes you type a letter and hear two beeps so you're not sure if you typed two of the same letter or not.The touchscreen is awful.  I have small fingers but I almost always touch two keys at the same time.  When you try to swipe to go left or right, it almost always selects an icon instead or you have to swipe two or three times to get it to do anything.I tried to update the firmware and followed the instructions on the support webpage for this model camera and it says to open the software and click \"update firmware for the connected device\" but an error pops up and says that the connected device is not supported.  Then I tried to update it manually by copying the software to the SD card but it complains about a bad filename.  I searched the support knowledge base for this camera and there was a post on there by someone describing the same problem and the response by the tech (in broken English) said that this method is only for support personnel and that all the files weren't available.

I think this is a great small camera, it takes neat pictures and great videos, this is not a professional camera but still really impressive. The only things I don't like much are that the sound is interrupted (goes off a bit lower) when zooming in a video, also it has a small delay from picture to picture, you have to wait a couple of seconds to take another picture, additionally I haven't found the functionality to tag my friends in the pictures I upload to facebook from the camera but I guess I just need to figure it out yet, night pictures/videos are a pain but I wouldn't blame Samsung because night shots are always difficult, other than these small details I am very happy with my new camera. 4.5 is my final score for this camera.

The big seller of this camera is the Wifi, and I have to say it's pretty functional but not great.  The camera puts caps on the photo and video (320x240 and 30 seconds, stills are 2MP or less), so when you upload anything to Facebook or Youtube, it will be relatively limited.  The Wifi pops on and off when you need it, so uploading photos isn't quite as instantaneous as a smartphone.  It doesn't allow you to configure new locations to upload to, so you are pretty much limited to photobucket and Facebook and Picasa.  Flickr is absent from the lineup.The other thing I've noticed about this camera is its rather poor video recording quality.  The video is fine, but the audio is barely audible, even when imported to a computer to be watched.  For the price I had, it's nice to have a compact point and shoot which allows me to upload a few photos to Facebook or my email when needed.  It was also a hassle to upgrade the firmware, having to go through the program and hookup to a computer to upgrade the July 2011 firmware.

I'm a techie and love all the tech features of it, particularly the direct uploads via wifi. I bought the camera as a gift for my sister, and while it shot pictures and video just fine, none of the wifi upload features worked. It would *constantly* fail to connect to the server. Also, most of the screens were completely different on this camera vs mine. Luckily, I hack phones and tablets all the time, so I wasn't afraid to try to update the firmware.It turned out that the camera shipped with significantly newer firmware than the very latest available via the Samsung support site. Not only that, but the firmware update tool refused to downgrade the camera's firmware to the latest version available for download. I had to manually download the firmware package, pull the files out and place them on an SD card in just the right way to force the camera to downgrade the firmware. Luckily it worked on the first try, and that corrected all of the issues. It's as if Samsung either shipped a bunch of these cameras with the wrong firmware installed or shipped with an alpha or beta version that was nowhere near ready for the general public. My sister is lucky I'm good with this stuff, because she was pretty bummed that such a nice camera was so broken out of the box.I contacted the seller after solving the issues, and they were very receptive and appreciative of my detailed feedback. I doubt they're going to downgrade all of their cameras in inventory or swap them out with Samsung, but I just can't lie awake at night wondering what they're going to do to resolve this.Would have given 1 star if I wasn't such a geek.
