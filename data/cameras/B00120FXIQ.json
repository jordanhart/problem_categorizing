Here are my thoughts: Everything that came in the box was as expected.con :  each camera  require running cable until a local power source shared (4 cam) I was looking for was ensuring that each camera didn't require a local power source, as I didn't relish the idea of running receptacles to each camera location.I will like  single cable with an video connector that runs to each camera and carries both power AND video signal .Plus : very cheap, nice picture.I was impressed with the picture I got from the night vision from the cameras.Easy install software and run.recommended this systemSome of the features I like about this unit is of course the night vision cameras, the ability to view the cameras over the internet, the ability to record continuously or as motion sensors.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Frustratingly disappointed!!!", "Author": "Mr. Ruel G.

After connecting all necessary wires properly, my screen still says...\"video loss\", I tried to get help from the number provided but to no avail.  Customer service and tech support for this company sucks, no help at all.  I will try to return it, but not sure how yet, although I still have the box, but all 4 cameras are installed already along with the cables...grrr!", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a very good system", "Author": "Teri", "ReviewID": "R1N7YOKI7IZQQ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Amazing hard to install the software. The manual is written in oriental English and very hard to comprehend. The display is terrible and in less than 2 months the capture card went out. I contacted the company when originally installing the system. They were very very nice however, their English was very very bad <c>. The server part actually did get installed but the client software would never install on any of the computers. The software is difficult to work with, with not enough clear choices and poorly organized. If you are good with security systems you will probably have better luck than I did.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,009.95", "Features": "Surveillance Security Setup DIY; 4 x Color Infrared illuminated IR CMOS Cameras; 4 channel USB 2.0 network DVR.
