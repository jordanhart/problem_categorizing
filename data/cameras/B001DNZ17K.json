I was a little skeptical about buying the camera because of those reviews. But i went with my instincts and wanted to try it out for myself. Boy am I glad that I did. Sure the picture quality on the camera's screen is a bit grainy. But as you transfer it to a computer you will see how outstanding the picture quality actually is. The touch to focus is amazing for taking portraits. I love this camera and would recommend either this one or the newer model (Nikon S70). I used to work for Best Buy in the camera department so I know that the S70 is an amazing camera. If you have time swing by the store and check it out. Or just trust me and buy either that camera or this camera. I guarantee that you will be completely satisfied with the pictures that you are taking. Hope this helped. :)", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "nikon coolpix", "Author": "N.

I previously owned a Canon Powershot and an HP Photosmart. In comparison to the previous two that I owned, this one beats them hands down. I really like this one for several reasons. It is a very small and compact camera that can easily fit into a purse or a pocket. The camera body is sturdy, and the finish is sleek and beautiful. The touch display is easy to read and understand, and quite simple to use. For camera users not used to operating a camera by touch display this can take a little getting used to, but I like it because it eliminates so many confusing buttons, and you can see your photos so much clearer. The display icons are relatively simple to understand once you've read the manual and know what each of them means. I love the picture quality even without the flash, and I love the fact that you can do a bit of retouching of your photos right there on the camera itself. Any further retouching can be done with your favorite photo editing program.With a lithium ion battery this camera has great battery life. I really like the fact that this camera doesn't use alkaline batteries, as you get a much longer battery life with the lithium ions. The included battery charger is very compact, and nice to use for travel. I would highly recommend getting a good and sturdy case for this camera, and also an LCD screen protector to protect the touch screen from smudges and scratches. This is a great camera for beginners and experts alike, and I am very happy with it. It was relatively simple to use right out of the box, but I would recommend careful reading of the manual before prolonged use. Overall, a great product! You won't be sorry that you bought this gem of a camera!", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not What I Expected", "Author": "Karishma", "ReviewID": "R2U19I05CLR0O1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With all the hype, I expected the NIKON Coolpix to be a great purchase but it barely made it to \"good\". Sure, it takes pictures but the quality, menu format and overall user interface is very poor. I do not recommend this camera.

It's a great size and was great for our trip to Italy.  But it slowly died due to the common \"lens cover error\" that so many are also commenting on.  It would do that sometimes and then it got to the point where I can't turn the thing on anymore.  We had it for 4 years, so maybe I shouldn't complain.  But I am going to spend less money this time, knowing that these things just don't last.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "I was shocked I thought Nikons where good cameras", "Author": "Ms. Tiffany Michelle Fletcher", "ReviewID": "RNN3XHIAWE8TO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife for christmas, when we took it out and took our first picture, and was shocked at how poor the picture quality was.  We paid $250 for this camera thinking it was worth it because of the rep. of nikon, but the picture quality was equal to a $99 camera that we bought from walmart couple years earlier which is not a popular brand.  We are thankful that the company we bought it from allowed us to return it.  We ended up going with a sony camera.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Rave review, but...", "Author": "Jeffrey K. Ericson", "ReviewID": "RJUHH2LPMELZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT camera.  I bought it for my wife to carry around.  She is not a gadget geek, but she is nuts about this camera, and will show it off to anyone who will listen.  The stylus and drawing feature is really great, and she uses that all the time.  When she shops for clients, she takes a picture of the product in the store, and then scribbles the price and some notes on the image with the little stylus.  It is very handy.The reason it gets 4 stars instead of an enthusiastic 5 is the lens cover is defective and we're having to repair the camera after only about a month of use.  Also, the battery life seems to be erratic - sometimes we'll get well over a hundred shots on one charge, and sometimes less than a day.I'd also highly recommend (insist) that you purchase a case for this camera to protect the display and keep it from getting turned on inadvertantly.  Nikon's model works pretty well.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S60", "Author": "Lana Spence \"57 chevy girl\"", "ReviewID": "R1OUMYQO4N74TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter loves this camera and got up to speed the first day!
