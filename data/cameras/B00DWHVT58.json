{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best package available for Canon 70D anywhere!", "Author": "Jari", "ReviewID": "R2E1PUJ69MAEN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an avid photographer, I wanted more than my older Canon EOS could give me, and since it had cost me a small fortune with all the lenses I owned, not to mention the accessories, I thought I'd have to replace everything whether I purchased the Canon 70D or Nikon 7100. Thus I chose to try this package that included everything I needed to the upgrade to the Canon 70D (sans lenses), a perfect choice and I was thrilled with the quality of the items I received and at a great savings. The best news was that all my older lenses worked beautifully with the newer Canon 70D.Before I purchased I had researched and compared the Canon 70D with the Nikon 7100 and discovered that although the Nikon had some features I liked, I wasn't convinced it was worth switching loyalty from Canon. Now, I'm convinced the Canon 70D was the right choice, as it spins circles around the Nikon, feature for feature. (Auto focus, High ISO image quality in JPGs, color balance, servo speed and recording, video, etc.) With the Canon touch screen being a one of it's most outstanding features that once again out-shined Nikon.Great camera, great deal, and I'm very happy with not only my choice in a new DSLR camera, but with Amazon and their partners.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,239.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS 70D Digital SLR Camera Body + <2> Canon 2400 DSLR Camera Case + <3> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E6 Battery + <5> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<7> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <8> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> LCD Screen Protectors + <12> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet", "Name": "Canon EOS 70D Digital SLR Camera Body with 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + Tripod + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZAXHJQtkL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DWHVT58"}}
