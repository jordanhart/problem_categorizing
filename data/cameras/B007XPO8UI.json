It actually took really decent pics and videos, both out and in the water.  Tried it in the ocean (not deep, just in 1' deep water) and in a swimming pool.  Rinsed it with clean water each time it was used underwater, as recommended in the manual.  It actually died during use outside of the water, in a completely dry environment.  The onboard software crashed, strange flickering of the screen.  Rebooted once, worked for 20 seconds, and then never rebooted again.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "I got this camara for a gift ;(", "Author": "carlos", "ReviewID": "RI16Y3RM4NVTW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camara for a gift ;( and send to my sister for her birthday ; I safe this item for more than 30day until I shipping overseas...I never open or check since I trust the product, however my sister open and found a bad batteries , after she got a new ones , took 2 fotos and the batteries died again .
