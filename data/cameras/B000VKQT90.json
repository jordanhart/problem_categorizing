I can honestly say that the Kodak was better.  Here's why:1. The Nikon (compared to the Kodak) produced pictures that were grainy,dark, had poor color saturation, and caused people to blink.  The outdoor pictures were flat but otherwise okay.2. The movie mode is at best terrible.  Even on low resolution, there were frame skips, and poor sound.  The Kodak never had this problem.3. The shutter release is very slow.  Even if pre-focused, it is slow.  Do not use this camera for taking pictures and children's birthday parties.4.  The controls (for a point and shoot) are poorly laid out, and complicated.I have always thought highly of Nikon but this is a clear miss on their part.  Look elsewhere for a point and shoot camera.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon style but not function", "Author": "Peter Sheppard \"Petes pics\"", "ReviewID": "R2QS5I16WQ03C1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This has been my most unhappy purchase from Amazon to-date. And only because I shipped this to an address in the USA when I visited and now live outside the USA, I cannot return it. If I bought it from a store directly it would have definitely been returned for another brand.For the past two years I have been using my CASIO EX-Z750 7.2mp and loved everything bout it: Shooting modes, picture quality, body durability and most importantly superb battery life. But after its been battered around in my travels I though I would get  new one. Since I have previously purchased via Amazon ( gift received) a Nikon D200, I thought I would stick to the same brand......BAD IDEAThe Body of the Nikon S51C seems fairly fragile and is extremely sensitive. The battery/Card lid underneath seems insecure, the shooting modes are limited, have not figured out the WiFi features as it is time-consuming nd I am constantly on the move and the battery-life is pathetic. I no sooner get out at night, take 10 shots and the \"Exhausted battery\" signal comes on and that is it! So much so, that I hve just hd to spend extra money to buy an additional battery and charged (via Amazon)I cant wait to get rid of this camera and find a suitable replacement. Sorry Nikon, I thought I was being loyal and have purchase endless lenses and other accessories for my D200 which I absolutely love and more recently purchase the Nikon SLR/LAPTOP nap-sack as my loyalty to the brand, but this product has disappointed me.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Choice for Picky Snapshooter", "Author": "Virginia Reader", "ReviewID": "R1J4XHL0CS8JJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Are you looking for a quality digital camera that takes great high-resolution snapshots? One that easily slides into your pocket? One that is reasonably priced? Well, there are lots to choose from, these days. Give the Nikon Coolpix S51 or S52 consideration.I am a bit picky and I was looking for something more than simple point and shoot for a recent sightseeing trip to Italy. My days of film cameras are over, but the versatility of an interchangeable-lens 35-mm SLR was on my mind. I loved the Nikon FS2S I used for over 30 years. Yet, the bulk of camera and several lenses\u2014and the cost\u2014was of major concern. What if I dropped an $800 camera or worst, it was stolen? I decided to forego the advantages of a new digital SLR and try getting by with the much cheaper and smaller Coolpix S51C. The model with the \"C\" has Wi-Fi capability. I'm not a professional photographer, so really good \"snapshots\" with a bit of creativity better categorized my style this trip.Here are the things I really like:First, the picture quality is wonderful for such a camera. The high-resolution setting yields sharp pictures suitable for prints 8\"x10\" and beyond. Regrettably, there is no RAW format, but the dynamic range has pleased so far. Second, the size and weight. I can't say enough about how great it was to slip the camera into my shirt pocket\u2014a bit heavy there\u2014or pants pocket. Here are some more things I like about this camera:- The settings are easy to make with the thumbwheel control and built-in settings software.- There are a variety of pre-set modes: landscapes, sunsets, museums, etc.- Vibration reduction works surprisingly well.- Almost always, exposures are right on. I did find that manually increasing or decreasing exposure helped in a few unusual lighting situations. This is quick and easy to set.- The pre-set mode I really like, one you won't find in most other cameras, is panorama assist. This is really neat. Set it and take the first picture. Then one-third edge of that picture appears in the LCD screen, transparent so that you can line up and overlap the next picture. By taking a series of pictures this way you can later create an ultra-wide panorama photo, or if you go all the way around, a 360-degree panorama. Software is provided for stitching pictures together to create the panorama from the individual shots. Traditionally, such pics require a better camera, tripod, and patience. I made several panoramas, even handheld. Works great!- Battery life is pretty good. I bought two extras so I would never run out. Since I shot mostly without flash, one fresh battery charge would last much of the day, maybe 100 or more pictures. I'd recommend carrying at least one extra battery and recharging at night. I got a cheap, compact recharger and extra batteries before my trip.Some so-so features:- The lens is of fairly typical zoom range. It works well for most shots. There were a few times I wished the telephoto was longer. The digital zoom that goes beyond optical zoom adds lots of pixel noise and is unsatisfactory. I won't use it again unless I see Big Foot or a UFO. As for the wide end, it is just okay; not wide enough for great interiors. I just love really a true wide-angle lens, something comparable to a 21mm on a 35mm film camera, but that is unavailable in this type of camera. Again, the zoom range is average, but the quality is very good\u2014it's a Nikon lens.- Memory card. The memory card that comes with the camera is just too small unless you want to shoot just a few pictures at a time or only shoot medium- or low-resolution. I bought a 4 GB high-speed card and am glad I did. It stored almost a thousand hi-res pictures. I did swap out to a second 2 GB card after two weeks and came home with over 1400 photos, never having to offload images to a computer.And here are a few dislikes:- The polished metal case is slippery. Use the hand strap or risk dropping it.- The lens is in the corner. If you are not careful, you can get your finger in the field when shooting. You will learn how to hold the camera after a number of fumbles.- Even when selecting one of the pre-set modes like landscape, the auto-focus takes a moment to adjust itself. The lag between pressing the shutter and taking the picture might be a fraction of a second, but a fraction too late for that great shot. I wish I could turn off auto-focus and have several presets from which to choose.- Wireless Wi-Fi. I thought I would be able to transfer pics through my home wireless network to my desktop computer. Not so, or at least I haven't gotten that to work and can't find anything in any manual. I was able to send several pics to the Nikon server called Picturetown. But, that transfer choked because the wireless is just too slow to handle hi-res pictures. Don't count on sending anything but a few low-resolution pictures to grandma via the direct wireless feature. If you don't absolutely need the Wi-Fi feature, save the money and get the cheaper S51 or S52 model that has everything else and is a tad smaller and lighter.Now, one day, perhaps soon, I'm going to buy a digital SLR\u2014a Nikon, of course. I like looking through a viewfinder and setting focus myself. Most of all I want a great wide-angle lens. But I am very happy with my Coolpix S51C and will continue to use it on many occasions.Seeing Italy? I know you will be happy. I think you will be happy carrying along a Nikon Coolpix S51 or S52 too.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S51c", "Author": "Lawrence R.

This is probably the worst camera I have ever had in my life and I started digital photography with a 1MP Kodak digital camera. It took better pictures than this one.I bought this Nikon as a point and shoot camera in order to take pictures of my kids. It is small and beautiful, it has a large 3 inch LCD screen and these are probably the only good things about this camera.To be honest, sometimes it does take nice pictures. But most of the time it doesn't. Surely, it is my fault, as I am not a professional photographer and have very little patience to prepare my shots. I just want to take pictures of my kids and my family to remember my daily moments as they grow up. Still, that was what I thought point and shoot cameras were made for.My list of complains about this camera is so large that it won't fit this review. But I want to let you know about its worse problems. I am so disapointed with this camera that I am probably not buying a Nikon camera again, at least not for some time. How could they sell something so horrible?Here is my list of problems:1) Automatic White Balance doesn't work indoors without flashThat's correct. If you take photos indoors with this camera, you need to use the manual white balance. If you leave it in automatic or in tungsten mode (as it should be), this camera will take horrible yellowish pictures. Using the flash will help, but if you want or need flashless pictures indoors, you will need to calibrate the camera against a grey or white area before you start shooting. Even worse, manual white balance does not work for video modes, and all your indoor videos will become hopelessly yellowish. Nothing to do about that, as flash is not an option for video.2) The automatic camera shutter speed tends to be very slow. Maybe this was done on purpose, as the camera has a surprinsingly good lens stabilizer that compensates for hand movement. However, the stabilizer does not prevent my kids from moving and having slow shutter speed means that 90% of the pictures are blurry, not because of hand movement but because of kid (subject) movement.3) The camera lens is horribly placed. It is on the upper left corner, a place that everyone will use to rest their fingers. Maybe, after you ruin 1000 pictures with your finger in front of the lens, you will remember not to do it, but all your friends and family will still do it, and the few pictures in which you expected to appear are going to be ruined forever.4) Also, the power button is in such a place and has such a sensitivity, that your camera will be turned off whenever you want it to be on. And it will turn on when you don't want it, probably draining the battery which has a very short life anyway.5) Contrast is another problem. Shadow spots on sunny days become completely shaded and black. This is so bad that you might end up trying to compensate with the flash. This however, will make you pictures worse, as the sunny spots will become washed out.6) The camera is fragile. Mine started to tell me that the SD card was write protected and would not write to the card, even though the write protection switch was off. I had to have it serviced under warranty less than 6 months after I bought it. And wait for 2 months for Nikon to fix the problem. Searching on the Internet I found out that this is a rather common problem with this camera.7) The camera is very slow. Slow to turn on, slow to focus, slow to take pictures.8) The wifi functionality is a joke. A bad joke. It only allows you to send pictures via Nikon's own photo storage service (called mypicture town). You cannot use wifi to copy pictures to your computer directly. How can this be so bad???The list of problems goes on and on.  All I wanted was to take some good pictures of my kids growing. And I have been trying. But with this camera, it's not likely to happen.I think that the good thing is that this camera is already discontinued.

We really like the features and quality - both of the camera and images. But here is the problem. Take 20 pictures of someone (especially children) and guarenteed 19 of them will be with the subjects eyes closed! This is because the camera has NO flash mode where there is not an INCREDIBLY ANNOYING \"pre\" flash. Call it red eye reduction, call it background fill-flash, whatever you want to call it, 99% of your subjects will blink. Then when the real flash comes, their eyes are closed. The only option without this is to turn the flash off.The 2nd problem with the camera is it is slow. Slow to focus, slow to snap. Just annoying.The 3rd problem is the cameras tendancy to get \"orbs\" in the pictures. Some people think these are ghosts, they are not, they are dust, pollen, dirt, bugs - whatever - lit up by the flash and appear as orbs in the picture. This is especially prevelant with cameras where the flash is close to the lense; it could not be any closer on this camera!A lot of digitals have these problems so check them all out and return them until you find one that you are happy with!If it was not too late to return this camera, I would.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cool camera", "Author": "D.

This was the worst of the lot, by far.Behind the lens, inside the camera body where it could not be reached for cleaning, was a collection of dirt and \"something\" that caused spots to appear. It is as though there was mold or some growth having taken place which showed up as small unfocused areas in almost every image. It seemed to depend on the lighting and the focal distance whether the spots were more or less visible. They were, e.g., more apparent in low light conditions than in brighter light, so naturally indoors with flash were the worst ones -- where small details and faces might be the most important parts of the photo, of course.The shape of the camera body and very smooth satin metal surface make it difficult to hold and to manipulate. What should be a one-handed camera, when necessary, was always a two-handed effort just to keep from losing the thing over a railing, or into the gutter or a bowl of soup.I bought a Samsung to replace this Nikon and have been very happy with the Samsung's shape, surface texture and image-making performance.
