It's about 180 feet to the barn and it's works perfectly as long as I have a clear line of site from the barn to the house.It's setup on our bedroom TV and we can keep an eye on our mare and new born colt without going outto the barn.  Setup was easy, pairing was done simply before I installed.  No real complaints, except night vision is a bit hazy.  It also has a one way mic, barn to the house.  Wish It had a mic back to the barn.  Wind noise on the mic is a problem, but we just mute the TV.  Would buy this unit again.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "AZ", "ReviewID": "R2B4O3ZPB3X51L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Q-See security system which included two of these cameras.  Although they are color cameras, the colors they produce in the daylight are off (red is green, green is black, etc.).  In addition, the cameras produce poor range (less than 20ft).  With that said, night time performance is adequate, you get about 6ft of night vision in black and white of course.A friend of mine purchased a Lorex security system with two wireless cameras which produce true colors during the day and give much better range.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wireless camera with very poor limited reception range", "Author": "Bruno", "ReviewID": "R2DB2MSSTW7V0I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these cameras. There isn't one thing good about them.The main problem is reception. One camera was mounted above my garage door at the end of my driveway. The receiver was placed in a side window of my house at the front of the driveway. It is not line of sight because there is a bay window on the side of the house between the garage and the front window but the distance between the camera and the receiver is only about 60 feet through open air. Reception is sporadic even with the receiver right up against the window. If you approach or stand near the camera there is no reception at all. No reception when someone approaches the camera defeats the purpose of having a camera.The other camera is located on the front of the house about 20 feet from the receiver. While I get full time reception from that camera I cannot move either the camera or receiver an inch or I lose the picture.The audio pickup on the cameras is poor. They pick up random noises and voice but nothing consistently or reliably.The video picture on both cameras is very choppy even at the highest setting.Night vision is decent but what good is that if you're not getting reliable reception. Changing channels does not help.I do not recommend these wireless cameras.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth it for a wireless camera", "Author": "CL", "ReviewID": "RN5NVFB1BVLD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't like this camera at all. The range was terrible, granted I was trying to get a signal through an obstructed view. (through a ext. wall). But I figured I try it out. The picture quality when it did work wasn't great either. I ended up returning it and buying a Lorex wireless instead (this one) Lorex Digital Wireless Outdoor Security Camera with Audio LW2220 . It worked in the same application unlike the Qsee, and the picture quality is great. I should clarify that use a Qsee dvr and hard wired Qsee cameras.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "works just fine", "Author": "J.
