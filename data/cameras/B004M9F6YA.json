{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does Samsung know they sell this camera???", "Author": "mitchg", "ReviewID": "RLGDKLS3EDBA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree w/ the reviews before mine, about Samsung not even knowing they have this camera for sale.  Its NOT on their US website, but IS on their overseas version... Yet those that DO happen to sell it here claim its the US model.  I got one (not from Amazon) and did like it for the compactness, quality build, and excellent lens - 24mm w/ an 18x is pretty amazing, you have to admit!But it charges thru a strange cable that has a usb port that connects to the charger head, and then to the cameras hdmi? input.  Its NOT a usb port on the camera for charging.  If you lose this special cable, you're screwed, and it is short.The flash seem pretty weak, and speed of picture to picture pretty standard (slow.)  Pictures outside looked very good, and the stabilization is truly amazing.  I could make out license plates from 150 yards away.  Well done on the lens. It chose a pretty slow shutter speed inside, even w/ the flash turned on.  Many were blurred - I was surprised.For the price I paid - $249, it seemed like a very fair deal, but I would rather pay just a bit more to get something I really think is much better.  And Samsung - what is going on w/ your marketing of this product?  It is AWFUL - not one review anywhere, and barely anyone is selling it.Also - no paper manual for this camera is included. Its on CD, I guess - I didn't look at it, which I guess says a lot for the cameras ease of use.  Like I said, its a good value, but I'd really like to see some professional review first, so I know how it compares w/ the competition.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just OK, but missing some modes", "Author": "C. Riley", "ReviewID": "R1ZTB4WQNCWPPL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera now for about 2 weeks and can only give it an \"OK\" rating.  Compared to the HZ30W and HZ35W the pictures are not as vibrant.  I have to also say that the same is true compared to the TL34HD.  They are plenty clear, and certainly the zoom function is good, but the colors just don't look as life-like.The better parts are, of course, the zoom and some other little improvements in the camera. The zoom on the WB700 is nice and the camera itself feels a bit more compact and solid than the HZ30W/HZ35W.One thing that it is also missing one function I liked on the HZ30W/35W (and TL34HD) and that is the \"vivid\" mode.  I believe all the other modes are there, but not \"vivid.\"  Seems like a strange thing to leave out and it would be helpful in order to get the camera to record the colors closer to what the eye sees since it isn't doing that on its own.In general, the camera is an okay upgrade to the HZ30W.  Personally though I would keep my HZ30W and wait until the next upgrade before buying.  Hopefully Samsung will realize that the vivid mode is handy and add it back in.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good little camera", "Author": "Canuck_Doc", "ReviewID": "RXCWWBXSNKHL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a DSLR, but wanted something small and portable for every day use and travel.  I purchased this online and started using it right away -- and I have no regrets.  Image quality and features for a camera of this size and price are almost amazing.  The wide angle at minimal zoom on this Samsung would cost me a fortune on my DSLR because I would have to buy a new lens.  The telephoto is similarly impressive, but lacks some sharpness at maximal zoom.  Contrast in images seems a little low at times, but then this is easily remedied in image editing software.  I can recommend this camera without hesitation for travel or casual use.  One complaint: the charging cable is way too short (it's only 18 in) and the connection is proprietary rather than mini-USB.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dont make them like they used to", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R3PGWNZ8C2N43I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I in the last five years I have owned a total of 3 digital cameras all being Samsung. The second one being the HZ30W witch I really liked, great value and good quality pictures. When the wb700 came out I decided to give the old one to my girlfriend to buy this one seeing it looked like the same model except with more zoom cant go wrong with that right? Wrong.The reason I was buying another Samsung was because of the good experience I had before, but I was in for a surprise. Right out of the box the zoom did not work right. The zoom button would get stuck and I would have to manually move it back. After a couple days of dealing with Samsung customer service they told me to ship it to one of there repair facility's in California and I would have to pay for the shipping to get it there. After I shipped it I got it back about a week later and the zoom button worked but now the mode select button is malfunctioning. When trying to shoot a picture the mode selection changes on its own not allowing you to take a picture until it reselect the mode you were on before.I have had enough with this camera, next time I think I am going to buy a Panasonic. My friend has bought a couple over the years and has not had issues with them. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS20 my friend just got takes great pictures and I am very tempted to replace mine with one of those.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy", "Author": "K.
