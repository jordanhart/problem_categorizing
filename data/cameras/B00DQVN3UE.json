{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great POV camera with a lot of potential", "Author": "Riki N.", "ReviewID": "R1ACV06WZ8TE4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Looxcie HD is a highly functional alternative to other POV cameras on the market, sporting sharp picture, unexpectedly impressive audio pickup, a sleek aesthetic and superior ease-of-use. Though the product has minor design and programming flaws, it still stacks up well against its competition, making it a great option for a variety of uses.SET-UP: 4.5/5The Looxcie HD does require some degree of set-up; in this manner, it isn't the easiest device in the world to get started on, especially for people lacking the necessary technology-savvy to figure out how to set up anything more complicated than an iPod. Even so, I feel that a vast majority of users will find the software set-up process painless.BUILD QUALITY: 4/5The Looxcie HD itself has an exoskeleton that is light but doesn't feel cheap. Even so, the apparently glass lens panel and hard non-rubber edges should worry anyone who wishes to potentially inflict abuse on the product without the rugged waterproof case. With the rugged enclosure, however, the camera is completely protected from all weather - I've used it on a boat, in a pool, in the Pacific Ocean - and seems very resistant to shock and abuse. Placing the camera inside the enclosure does make the product a bit more bulky and the audio pickup suffers, but these are certainly to be expected.AESTHETIC: 5/5The camera itself looks really cool: it's sleek and modern but not flashy. There simply isn't a better-looking POV hands-free camera on the market that I've seen. No matter how I have it mounted, I can't help but feel a tiny bit like I'm an FBI agent posing as a professional athlete or undercover citizen, which should tickle the fancy of any and all gadget geeks as well as travel, fitness, and adventure buffs. You WILL get questions about the camera, and everyone I've used it around has expressed some interest in having one themselves.PICTURE + AUDIO: 4.5/5Looxcie HD shoots in 1080p (30 fps), 720p (60 fps), and 480p (30 fps) resolutions. Depending on the speed of your activity, you'll likely only toggle between 1080p and 720p HD. On a 64GB microSD card, you'll store 6 hours of footage at 1080p, which should be substantially more than necessary for most people performing most activities. On a $22 external battery pack, I've managed about 12 hours of recording time, which is great if you'd like to forget about the camera and enjoy an adventure (i.e. you want to chronicle an all-day hike at Yosemite National Park).The picture quality, especially 1080p and in good lighting conditions, is stunning. My roommate is a Computer Science major with a critical eye when it comes to gadgets, and he sounded completely blown away at the quality of the video I was able to get with the camera.The audio pick-up without the rugged enclosure is actually quite good. The microphone on this device is superior in my experience to similar cameras such as the GoPro 2 + 3 and Flip HD. In the enclosure, most sounds will be significantly muffled, which to my mind is only a good thing in the case of moving water (you do get pretty cool wave crashing noises if you're using it in the ocean).On the down-side, the Looxcie HD performs only about as well as other POV cameras in low-light situations (hands-free cameras simply don't do well in low-light yet). The camera does recognize low light on its own, but in low-light conditions the Looxice HD will generally shoot slightly grainy video. Fortunately, the picture is good enough for consumer purposes, but for professional use the Looxcie HD simply does a lot better with good lighting.Further, the 1080p option shoots in 30 fps, which is sufficient for activities slower than 10-15 mph or without too much bouncing. In 1080p, activities such as running and downhill longboarding will tend to appear wavy, bouncy, or choppy. If you're planning on something fast or with a lot of bouncing motion, switch to 720p for comparable image quality but 60 fps which is more suited to handle the pace of your activity.FUNCTIONALITY + DESIGN: 3.5/5In terms of functionality, the Looxcie HD does regularly demonstrate a few flaws. Occasionally while plugged in, the Looxcie HD will eject itself unexpectedly. While this could be a problem on the computer end of the USB connectivity, I haven't had this problem with other devices. Generally this is only a minor inconvenience, but it can be frustrating especially if it happens more than once while attempting to view, arrange, or move video clips. The Looxcie HD also tends to do a mediocre job of recognizing the date of recording; when I upload to iMovie, most clips believe they were taken in December 2000 or January 1999. This should only be confusing, however, if you've shot several days of footage and wish to upload it out of chronological order. I don't know why you would do that, so I personally have no problem forgiving Looxcie for date errors.The Looxcie HD signals recording by illuminating a narrow red light above the lens. Remember how I mentioned that the Looxcie HD does exceptionally in well-lit conditions? This recording light does not. When outdoors, I find that I have to often cup my hand around the lens to see if the light has properly turned on. The upside to this might be recording discretion, but I'd sacrifice that for a more obviously red-or-not-red dot above the lens.While in the rugged waterproof case, the device cannot be turned on or off, as the switch for this is on the back of the camera. This is understandable for waterproofing purposes, but the downside is that in order to conserve battery while using the case, you'll need to remove the camera from the case in a dry area to switch the power on or off. If you attempt this in wet conditions such as in rain or with wet hands, moisture can build up inside the case and, while this likely won't damage the device, it can cause the lens window to fog up which can obviously result in less crisp picture.Despite its design drawbacks, however, the Looxcie HD has an intuitive button layout that anyone can learn, and after learning it once you won't need to learn it again. By comparison to my experience with a GoPro 2, which only has one main button for all its functions, the Looxcie has very little learning curve, whereas the GoPro sometimes felt like performing morse code and would require me to re-learn the necessary commands after a few weeks away from the camera. This problem does not exist with the Looxcie, which makes its design among the most user-friendly cameras on the market next to the Flip HD (which isn't hands-free).FEATURES + ACCESSORIES: 4.5/5One of the most unique features Looxcie introduces is built-in Wi-Fi and mobile network connectivity for live streaming to Facebook, the Looxcie smartphone app, and other social media outlets. While the Looxcie app currently suffers from some programming and design flaws that can make it a little tricky to use, the live streaming option has a huge variety of possibilities that make it an attractive feature. Travelers can stream their overseas adventures for friends and family back home, and social media faces with a following can live stream their experiences as well.The Looxcie HD Outdoor Pack comes with a ball cap clip, helmet mount, and bike handlebar mount. I've only used the ball cap and helmet mounts because the handlebar mount was not narrow enough to properly stay on the handlebars of my BMX bike. My favorite of the mounts is the ball cap clip because it is by far the most multi-functioning accessory. I've clipped it to the side of a longboard, a backpack strap for a shoulder-mount view, and a variety of hats and headwear. I imagine it could also work on a belt or on pants for hip-level footage. The ball-and-socket design isn't that stubborn on its own, however, so at certain orientations for certain activities, the camera will go off-kilter and need to be adjusted. I've remedied this issue by tying a rubber band around the ball-and-socket joint to keep the mount from moving around. Other than that adjustment, I've never had any of the mounts fail on me during use, which is without doubt an important consideration for a hands-free camera. The Outdoor Pack also comes with the rugged waterproof case, which so vastly increases the number of potential uses for the device that, in my opinion, it is the single most enjoyable and high-functioning accessory available for the camera.Overall, I find the Looxcie HD to be a very high-functioning hands-free POV camera that shoots beautiful video. Its ease-of-use makes it an attractive option for casual users and its many accessories and unique features make it a device with interesting and innovative implications for more hardcore techies. The Looxcie HD, in conjunction with its Outdoor Pack Accessories, earns an overall score of 26/30, or 86%. The Looxcie HD, despite some imperfections, makes a great addition to almost anyone's gadget collection.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Budget price  (lightning deal) with lots of extras but....", "Author": "C.

I prefer 720P@60fps  vs 1080P@30fps  but I have not been able to test with anything moving full speed..  The snow blowing outside looked kinda like static in the camera, but the semi dirty window and sunlight may attribute to this.Picks up Audio well too.  7/10 so far, not tested this well enough to say much more.The hat mount is loose, you will need to continually check to make sure it is pointed the right way, wont fall off your head though.the outside of it is scratched already and I haven't dropped it yet..  This is only a design flaw, weak surface maybe?  not sure.Indicates on the front if recording (red light)  so you cant really spy on people with it, Although it mounted to my blinds in my house and recorded the intersection out in front very well.Only notable Cons are how hot the device can get while in use or charging and the fact that the battery is worse than your Cell Phones.  - I will be using the Looxcie (looksy?) camera for flag football this spring and summer, look for further updates as to how this product can perform under the same circumstances a GoPro would be usedSo far I am very pleased with my purchase and am very excited to test it out this Sprint/Summer as a Inexpensive GoPro Substitute.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice little video camera", "Author": "Hambone", "ReviewID": "R1SVSMMJBJDVGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Looxcie HD Outdoor Pack is a small camera that packs a pretty big punch. The case in comes in is very nice and was easy to get it out of the half plastic half light cardboard case. I really like all the attachments it comes with and the plastic waterproof housing is really durable. I have dropped it a couple times while moving pretty fast and it just had a couple scratches on it.Trying to set it up is the hardest part of getting it ready to use. When you open it and read the instructions it says it already needs an update from there website. So i plugged it in went through the steps and it got about half way and would crash every time. After about 4 times I emailed them and asked what is the deal. I got a response within 24 hours and they said since mine is new it does not need an update only the pre-2013 models needed the update. Now I heard of a couple people getting these older models recently so it might be a hit and miss kind of thing. I have purchased two of these on lightning deals and both have been new models. After that I was ready to start recording. I downloaded the app and it is very nice to be able to see the picture on your phone and be able to record and stop recording from a device. So get the app.The picture quality is actually pretty darn good compared to a go-pro, at 1080p I really can't tell the difference. I use these along with a Canon T3I to record how-to videos and in editing I can't tell the difference sometimes if its a far away shot. Of course using a 50mm lens on the cannon you can tell because the depth focusing.You are able to record easy, throw it on your computer and have it within minutes. The battery life is pretty long depending if you run it long or just do stop and start vids like me. I bought an extra battery and has been a God send a couple times.Overall this is a good camera and I hope the company continues to invest into improvements, when they emailed me they said it still has a warranty and not to worry about future updates even though they are focusing on other things. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice small camera with tons of accessories, almost too much.*Update* April 24th 2014*Here is a statement directly from there website\" Looxcie Inc. has formally announced that it is restructuring its operations and will exit the consumer camera and accessories business. As part of this realignment, Looxcie will no longer provide updates or support after December 31, 2014.Services such as live video streaming to Facebook as well as Looxcie mobile apps on iOS and Android will also be discontinued at that time.Looxcie Inc. will continue to honor limited warranty claims for all cameras purchased from an authorized reseller or directly from Looxcie.\"The camera is still working good but with this information I would not purchase any future products with this company. It makes me upset because this really is a good product, but with no support or updates and probably a useless app in 2015, it is not worth it. Maybe they will have a wicked sale on these, if it gets below $100 its worth it.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "I would rather spend $100 for a Hero3+", "Author": "K.

I got this on a lightning deal since I had been wanting a GoPro for a while.  I thought this would be a good and cheaper alternative.  It is cheaper, but lacks a number of features I wanted.  In the end, it seemed like an upgrade to a cellphone video, but not a reliable and long running camera for documenting an extended bike ride or paintball game.The Good  For me, the video looked fine, about what you would expect.  I guess it would be fine for short Vine videos, but cant you just use your cellphone.The Bad1.  To change the settings from 1080p to 780p or the framerate requires hooking up to a PC.  Once unplugged from the PC your only choices are record on/off, or record for 30 seconds.2.  As noted in prior reviews the recording on off light is hard to see.  This is especially a problem for me mounting it on a bicycle or a helmet cause you don't know if what you are recording is actually being recorded unless you look directly into the lens.  This would not be a problem if you could set it to record everything and then forget about it - but the battery does not last that long.3.  There is no option for time lapse photography.  If you want to get pictures from an event of more than 1.5 hours then forget it.  The battery wont last that long and you cant baby the battery by setting it to take a picture every 5 seconds.In the end, it just was not for me.

I charged it up, installed the SD card, and started filming some test shots to get an idea of the quality. When I first copied the clips off of the device it prompted me to update the firmware. So I ran the update and copied the clips off. The clips had some issues with graininess and pixilization, one clip was even upside down, even though I was holding the camera the same way for each clip. After I copied the clips over the desktop software kept asking me again and again to update the firmware. I did this a few times and then the unit just stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to overnight a replacement unit. I had the same issues with the new unit! I was in touch with Looxcie and they tried to help. They told me that they had a bunch of units a while ago that were loaded with a faulty firmware that caused these problems, and also wouldn't allow it to update. Amazon was supposed to pull all of these faulty items and return them to Looxcie, apparently Amazon missed some. Their customer service started out nice, and then got nasty when I told them I had told Amazon about the firmware issues. They told me to go buy another off Amazon and that Amazon could do nothing about the fact that they were shipping out these defective units. So while nobody is completely to blame, I won't be looking to buy another through Amazon if they keep selling faulty units on sale to their unsuspecting customers, and Looxcie should be nicer to their customers and not put out defective units.
