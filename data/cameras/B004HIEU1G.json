Tobin", "ReviewID": "R31AUFF22HVEA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to have an extra battery for a roadtrip that we were taking. The fact that it was a Nikon branded battery and that the kit included a car charger is what pushed me to ordering this one specifically and it was a resonable price too. I feel that the price was worth it just for the charger and the battery the other extras we just icing. On our road trip we were car camping for 7 days and we used the car charger several times and it worked great. The batteries charged in decent time. I would definetly recomend this kit.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Genuine Nikon Battery", "Author": "Timothy R. York \"yorktr\"", "ReviewID": "R14MF9K3UF8I6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most reassuring thing about this kit is that the battery is a genuine Nikon EN-EL14, not a generic. As a recent purchaser of a Nikon P7100, I wanted to have a spare battery in my camera case, as I am now at the mercy of proprietary battery packs. Since the going price for an EN-EL14 is about $40, does this kit offer a good value at $54.95?Yes, it does. The kit also includes a charger on which \"EN-EL14\" is stamped into the plastic. The charger has a foldaway AC plug in the back, and the pictured car charging cord, which plugs into a coaxial jack on the charger, makes this charger more versatile than the Nikon MH-24. It is also much smaller than the Nikon charger, which is a distinct advantage for travel. I actually prefer using this charger. Since the MH-24 price is currently $44.95, this charger is certainly a good value.The memory card wallet holds three SD cards in the newer slim SD cases; not the older type. The card wallet is of acceptable quality, but nothing that will impress your friends. If you don't have an SD card wallet, it is a nice addition to this kit, and would be very useful in your camera bag. Likewise useful is a cleaning cloth built into a small pouch.Also included in the kit is a package of 3 cut-it-yourself LCD protectors, and a cleaning kit which may be of some use. The screen protectors are just so-so; not the same quality you would see for cell phone LCD screen protectors. The cleaning kit reminds me of what I used to take to the darkroom.All in all, this kit presents an excellent value. The genuine Nikon battery and the charger are themselves easily worth the $54.95; the other items in the kit enhance the value and may prove useful to you. The free shipping was relatively quick, so I would not hesitate to recommend this kit.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved It.", "Author": "cforrister", "ReviewID": "R14XV2JHZM5MTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What I received is exactly what I ordered.
