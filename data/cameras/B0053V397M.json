Look at his other reviews.  What's that, oh, only one other review under his profile, and it happens to be on the same date as this product review?  Hmmm, smells fishy to me, looks like a rating bloater.  I am more inclined to believe the one star reviewers for the simple fact that this camera system operates on the same frequency as many wireless appliances (namely cordless phones).  Feels like there would be a lot of cross interference in signals, and possibly degradation the audio and video quality of the cam system.  Save your money, look for a more reputable system.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.95", "Features": "Affordable wireless surveillance solution\n380 TV line video resolution.
