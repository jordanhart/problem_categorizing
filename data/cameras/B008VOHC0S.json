I like to have my camera with me at all times if possible.  And this little jacket was perfect.  The camera was very pretty and tiny.  I thought the jacket would be made out of real leather.  It sure looked like leather in the picture.  It turned out to be plastic.  But I still liked the idea of being able to wear this jacket criss cross like a purse and snap pictures whenever I was ready.  It would have been perfect for my food pictures.  I am writing a cookbook and constantly taking pictures of my food recipes and always snapping pictures I have to constantly pick up my camera and set it down, so I was looking forward to being able to have this camera constantly on my person.  Well, I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the photos this camera took and I ended up returning the camera.  I am continuing to use my Casio EX-ZR200 which is awesome!  I think the EX-je10 is better suited for a child who likes to take pictures.  I was thinking of giving it to my 5 year old niece.Wish my Casio EX-ZR200 had a pretty leather jacket like this one...", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008VOHC0S"}}
