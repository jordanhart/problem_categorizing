Loads of Nikon gear, etc. My first shot at digital was the Olympus D600L, a nice TTL digital. Not really comperable to a film camera, but good enough for small time digital only work - still used a couple of film cameras for 'serious' stuff. Just got the C-3040 after looking at its specs and reviews of the C-3030 here on Amazon. Amazon did not have the 3040 yet, so bought elsewhere (NY camera store).  The 3040 meets or exceeds all expectations. It is a REAL camera. Compact, light, easy to use for point & shoot yet with almost all the 'serious' capabilties. No wait between shots, low light capable with f1.8 lens and ISO 400 ability. See the reveiws for the C-3030, kick in the added speed, and you know what I mean! Plus the little things - lens cap tied to the camera, ability to use the LCD for framing, index at the back of the manual, easy to understand manual (but too much to remember because of the many, many functions available). Although you need to go through menus for some stuff, most of the commonly needed functions are either on the dial or telephoto control. Can't say enough good about this puppy - it looks like our film cameras are going into early retirement.

Carpenter \"clicar\"", "ReviewID": "R1S1J02UQTCJRK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree wholeheartedly with the many others on this site who have already told you about the excellent image quality this camera can produce. It's truly exceptional! Even on its default image-quality setting of \"HQ\" (medium), image quality is superb. I'm not a digital camera expert, although I've been using a Canon A-1 35mm SLR for 22 years. I've spent almost a year researching my digital camera alternatives - I should have switched earlier! The end results I got from the 3040 using its out-of-the-box \"point-and-shoot\" settings are substantially better than what I've generally been able to previously achieve in my years with a Canon A-1. Compared to several other digital cameras I've tried, I find the TV output from the 3040 is superior - very high quality. Note: some reviews I've seen say this camera supports both PAL as well as NTSC TV outputs. Olympus tech support web site says no: it's one or the other but not both. USA models only support NTSC - European models only support PAL.I found the camera easy to use and set up for the first time. The documentation is adequate and accurate but could use some help in the readability department. The supplied Camedia software is very ordinary, there are much better software products available at very low cost. USB connectivity to Windows Millenium worked great, dragging and dropping picture files couldn't be easier, although other software packages have a nice \"Transfer all pictures from the camera to a specific folder\" function that isn't available with the supplied Camedia software. If you connect the 3040 to your computer using USB, read the manual for the Camedia software carefully! The apparently obvious \"My camera\" icon on the Camedia PC screen is in fact non-functioning when USB-connected. The QuickTime movie function of the 3040 works well and is adequate for casual use but it won't replace your camcorder anytime real soon. To get the best use out of your camera, expect to purchase several accessories not provided in the box:  1. The provided 16MB SmartMedia is pitifully small - replace it with a 64MB or larger. I use a 128MB Olympus card (the *only* SmartMedia card that currently supports Olympus' panorama feature).  2. Buy an AC adapter to minimize use of the rapidly-consumed batteries - especially when uploading photo's to the PC or displaying photo's on the TV.  3. Buy two sets (that's eight altogether) of rechargeable lithium ion batteries - and a charger, if you don't already have one. Taking a lot of pictures - especially with flash, uploading pictures to your PC or showing photo's on your TV consumes batteries very quickly! The batteries provided in the box are not rechargeable!  4. Buy a protective case to carry your camera, spare batteries, and spare SmartMedia card.  I marked this camera down to four stars solely because of its price. I think Olympus needs to include several, or all of the items I found myself buying as \"accessories\" above. Having said that, don't be afraid to shell out the money for this camera - you won't be disappointed with the end results. At the end of the day, that's what really matters isn't it? This camera takes really, really great pictures - no if's, and's, or but's. Enjoy!", "Date": "July 3, 2001"}, {"Title": "A digital camera that finally beats film", "Author": "S.

The battery life is as great as ever too (mine lasted for 2 weeks of heavy daily use).  I still have the original set of rechargeable batteries that came with my C-2020 and they are still going strong many charges later. I have been keeping my old SLR around for taking the \"serious\" shots with but I think those days are over.  I did some test shots on a vase with a multi-colored design in varying light conditions (with no flash and uncompressed).  I printed the digital shots on my HP-952C and compared them to the 35mm shots when they came back from the lab.  I couldn't believe it.  In all but the lowest lighting conditions the digital shots were better.  I had the best 35mm shot enlarged to 8x11 and printed out the best digital shot on 8x11.  I really expected the digital shot to be a little grainy but I couldn't see any distortion.  It was easily the equal of my SLR!Good bye film, digital has finally crossed over the line.  I am never going back.A few tips:  Spring for an extra set of batteries so you can swap them out.  Buy a 128MB or 64MB Smart Media card and spend a few extra bucks on a name brand so you don't get stuck with a dud.

After witnessing the near 35mm quality of the new generation of 3.3 megapixel models, I decided the time had come.  Of course, much research had to be done, but I came to my choice of the C-3040 fairly quickly after triangulating information from photography magazines, Amazonians and online photo sites.  The superfast lens cemented the deal, as I prefer to shoot sans flash whenever possible.Getting started with the C-3040 was fairly straightforward and within a couple of hours I had taken 20 or so photos and uploaded the good ones to Ofoto.  When the 5x7's I ordered arrived in the mail a few days later, my jaw nearly hit the floor.  The quality of the image and trueness of the colors are just amazing.  I hate to admit it, but the images have more clarity and detail than those shot with my Nikon N2000 SLR!  Also, I hadn't fully appreciated the convenience factor of using a digital camera in conjunction with an online photo service.  I'm a touch sad to say it, but my 35mm days may be behind me.", "Date": "June 2, 2001"}, {"Title": "I'm a believer", "Author": "M. H. Bayliss \"book queen\"", "ReviewID": "RN3EA771WVOAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I'm hardly an expert photographer, I feel like one now with this camera.  I love just about everything about it.  First of all, it looks like a real camera, not one of those pieces of junk that pass for cameras these days.  It takes incredible pictures right out of the box.  I have the option set for the camera to ask me everytime I take a picture whether I want to keep it or not.  That way, I can quickly zap any bad pictures.  The LCD monitor is easy to see so you have instant feedback as to whether or not you want to retake the picture.  The manual was very well written -- I spent a good deal of time reading it.  Even thought the camera does many things, the menu function is very intuitive.  After a day or so, I was able to do pretty much anything, even use shutter priorty mode or aperature priority mode.  Although many software programs have color options, I love the fact that you can shoot in black and white, color or sepia tones.  Also, this camera has both a digital and an optical zoom -- beware of false claims by other cameras.  I did a great deal of research before buying this camera and I'm happy to say after a month of using it, I have not been disappointed at all.  Some suggestiosn for accessories:  buy a card reader!  You don't want to drain the battery by using the USB cable right from the camera.  They only cost around $35.  You'll want at least a 64 MB card!  The one it comes with is too small (for the price of this camera, I think Olympus should throw it in).  The battery it comes with was dead on arrival and since it is not recharchable, forget it.  Buy AA rechargable batteries (one charger, two sets of batteries) and switch them often.  The batteries lose charge fast when you use the monitor feature, so beware and carry spare batteries when you travel!

I point this out because mid-range digital cameras are NOT really going to placate all of the needs of the amateur photographer, but may be appropriate for your situation.  Caveat photographer.The biggest adjustment I've had with the C-3040 is the slowness in taking pictures -- delays of 1  to 5 seconds (fresh batteries, not including the startup time for the lens to extend to the default setting) before the photo is actually grabbed.  While fine for still life, this is a problem for truly spontaneous photos, such as of one's kids.  Expect blurry pictures on anything that's moving at more than a walking pace.A second criticism is the flash seems too bright and colors wash out.  You can compensate for this in Photoshop, but I don't really think you should have to.  On the positive side, uploading pictures is extremely easy: on my Win2000 machine, I just plug the camera in, and the camera's pictures appear as a removable device.  Just cut and paste to your local machine.Resolution is very good and services like Ofoto can print up to 20x30\" prints from the default (2048x1536) image size.  (With a 128Mb memory card, you can get 162 pictures at this resolution.)The menu system in the camera is fairly extensive and you can alter default behavior such as turning off the camera's beep, changing color mode, shutter speed, color balance, date, and resolution.  Another nice feature is you can enable verbose data display, which will show you what settings were used for each photo.The movie feature is actually more fun than I thought it would be.  Pictures are jumpy and the audio is fair, but I enjoy having it as an option.  You can record up to 74 seconds in one swoop -- this is a limit of the camera's internal memory, not the memory card size used.", "Date": "October 20, 2001"}, {"Title": "High Performance Control Freak", "Author": "Wayne Chung \"c4victor\"", "ReviewID": "R2447FUBAQM2LK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "+PerformanceThis digital camera allows FULL control of picture capture - apeture size, speed (1/800th sec!), film speed, a white balance differential, manual zoom, and basically everything you have in an SLR and more.  The pictures are excellent on the auto setting for outdoor shots. Indoor shots are more difficult, but can be done well with some steady hands and setting customization.  Close up shots are limited to greater than 7-8 inches.  However, there is a macro option allowing the range finder to know you are focusing up close.  The flash can bleach out images, but I've been using the white balance to correct this easily. From a straight forward image quality and ease of picture taking, I cannot complain.  The LCD screen is fabulously clear.  The interface does take some time to understand, but is no more difficult than a computer monitor interface.  The read/write can lag if you really push it with semi-auto like shooting or using repeated multi shot.  The zoom is not bad, but has something to be desired with the tube extension making the proportions not quite a true point-shoot camera or an SLR.+BonusThere are some nifty and useful functions like a 3-spot light meter that gives you the average, a 360 panorama stitching function, 5-shot `autowinder,' and video recording capability. The tactile feel is excellent with a non-slip surface on the hnad-interaction areas. +ConnectivityNo card reader needed with the included USB patch cable.  Super simple and a very fast download time.  Using XP makes it even easier - don't even need the 3rd party software.+LongevityWith a 128 MB card at 1600x1200 resolution (medium) I can burn through the card 1-2 times with downloads no problem, dependent on the flash and LCD use.  This is a lot of shooting on 4 AA NimH - from my past Kodak and Nikon dig cam experience.  Peeves include no immediate delete option when you've just taken a bad picture. And you can record audio to a picture, but can't playback on the unit until cpu download.  I could continue with the lame 16 MB card included and one-time use batteries, but the overall verdict is that Olympus made a very professional camera for people who want total control but the convenience of semi point-shoot size dimensions.  5 stars for rock-solid performance at a fair price.", "Date": "December 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Lewis", "ReviewID": "R3CONSMPTKKAWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I went shopping for a new digital Camera, I had several things on my wish list. One of the most important was that when I clicked the shutter, I wanted the picture taken THEN, not in 1/2 Seconds. Not in 1/4 Seconds. But THEN, before the subject moved. This camera has met my needs. I line up the shot, press the shutter 1/2 way down and the camera gets ready to take the picture. When the time comes, I press the button all the way down and I have My shot. I also wanted to be able to enlarge my picures to 8x10 and have them look good. They do.My object here was to get something to replace my 35MM SLR camera for vacation and family party shots. Since I normaly take about 10 Rolls of film at a family event, I feel that the camera will pay for itself after about 10 events It does eat batteries for Breakfast, lunch and dinner so I recommend 2 sets of rechargeables.With a 64 Meg Card it will take 81 HQ (2048x1536) Jpeg Shots, or 26 SHQ (2048x1536) Jpegs with less compression, or 6 (2048x1536) Tiff shots with no compression.  In my tests, I could find no aparent difference in the quality between these options. Since they are the same pixle size and since 8x10 is my target size, I shoot with the default HQ setting.  You can get more than 300 shots at a lower resolution, But I only tested the HQ and above.Did I mention the IR remote control? or the optional bounce flash?", "Date": "August 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good Digital Camera", "Author": "E.

I consider myself a serious amatuer photographer and have a range on Nikon cameras and a darkroom in my home.  This is my first digital camera and it had to do alot to make me happy given my background with film.The camera is very easy to use and the menu system is quite straight forward.  For everyday pictures of friends and family the automatic program mode offers very good point and click shooting.  I do not hesitate to let others snap away with it.  On the flip side, if I want to take photos requiring more control of the cameras functions I've been able to do so without having to resort to the manual.  Exposure compensation, flash control (red eye reduction, synch, exposure comp), aperture and shutter priority modes are all very easy to manipulate through the menu and cursor.  There are still a few controls that I've not yet tested and that I think says much about the depth of functions given how much I've tried to push this camera.The images are quite sharp and very esy to work with.  All of my computers run either Windows ME, 2000 or XP andthey all support plug and play USB so getting files from the camera to the computer has been very easy.  I've used this camera with at least a half dozen computers without any trouble.I have a few complaints, but I think these are endemic to digital cameras and not limited to this model.  The camera uses batteries quickly.  I wish there were more and better lens accessories.  I would especially like to work with graduated nuetral density filters for landscape shots.  Memory cards are expensive.  If you buy this or any digital camera you should consider at least a couple 64 or 128 MB cards and rechargeable batteries.  Adding these will boost your purchase price by a few hundred dollars, but will make your shooting that much more enjoyable.  In standard mode this camera will take 80 pictures on one 64 MB card.  Given that you can delete bad shots instantly this is like having three or four roles of 36 exposures in one camera.I would not hesitate to buy this camera again.  However, if you have some additional money to invest I would consider the Camdia 4040 which is basically a 4 megapixel version of this camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2001"}, {"Title": "Amazed at the sharpness and resolution", "Author": "Spots \"shialavati\"", "ReviewID": "R2QEQ05R3AU1A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been waiting for affordable digital cameras to get good enough to give me better pictures than my scanned 35mm negatives. Obviously I've waited long enough because this camera more than meets the test. There is a learning curve if this is your first digital camera--I recommend reading the manual--but the full complement of modes has not limited anything I've wanted to do. The macro focusing distance is close enough for normal flower shots--roses, lilies--and the camera fits my slow, cautious shooting style very well. I find the monitor easy to focus with, even with my post-middle-aged eyes. I can even use my reading glasses if I have too. The telephoto is long enough to be useful; shots from plane windows came out well. The f1.8 lens is great for indoor photography. If you're tired of futzing with film processing, dust&scratch cleanup, negative and proof storage, it's time to go digital! If you want to see your shots as soon as you take them, go digital! On my iMac, all I have to do is connect it, turn it on, and it looks like a drive. Copying 35 shots takes about two minutes. Get the rechargeable battery kit, have AA's for backup.

The C-3040 is the perfect size and weight (too light, and it's hard to keep steady). It takes excellent photos, a little on the dark side for indoor shots, but nothing that can't be fixed with half-decent photo editing software. If you don't use the LCD all the time, the battery life is acceptable, but you should still make one of your first accessories a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger (THE first should probably be a nice camera bag). Unless you're taking a large number of uncompressed photos, you can probably wait a while for a larger memory card. The included 16MB card takes about 20 pictures at the default resolution. Downloading to a PC takes about 30 seconds for all 20 shots, and you're ready for more. Still, a 64, or at least 32MB card would have been awfully nice and should probably be near the top of your list.The flash, with adjustable brightness and delay time, the optical zoom capabilities (DON'T get a camera without optical zoom), the USB connection and the programability were the major deciding factors in my purchase decision.There is, however, one drawback, but I don't think it's serious enough to merit a lower rating, and that's the fact that the image you see through the viewfinder is smaller than what will actually be recorded. You will have to compensate for this when you shoot. The best thing is to take a good number of test shots to get used to this effect before doing any serious shooting. The manual says using the LCD to compose your shot gives more accuracy, which is true, but there is still a difference between what you see and what gets recorded.Overall, I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone, except maybe a serious hobbyist or a professional. Also, it might be a little pricey for beginners or digital first timers, but if you can swing it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.Final things: Experiment with the different modes (black & white, sepia, etc.) and functions, and if you want an external flash attachment, you don't have to pay hundreds (almost as much as the camera) for the one Olympus sells; you can get the flash attachment BRACKET for about thirty bucks, and use almost any flash that has the 5-pin connector.", "Date": "January 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, very flexible in all light settings", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R9XDXDPFQTE9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great.

One or two little nits, 1) carry a set of extra batteries if you're going to take several pics at a time.

The C3040 overcomes the main shortcoming of these other cameras: speed. The C3040 is speedy two critical ways. First, it has an onboard memory buffer, so you can shoot many shots immediately after each other. Indeed, it features a \"rapid shoot\" and \"exposure bracket\" option to take 3 or 5 shots rapidly in about 1.5 seconds. This is a great option if you need the \"money shot\". I was at a friends wedding and wanted to provide a few unique candid photos. The 3040 did not disappoint. Second is the F1.8 lens... which means that low light shots are definitely possible. Last month I was on the Great Barrier Reef as turtles came up on shore to nest at night. The turtles are frightened off by light, so flash photography was out. With the speed of the lens, plus a near full moon and cloudless sky; I've got some grainy, but still incredible pictures.Other great features: sound recording/annotation and built in USB connector (soooo much faster to download).The C3040 is not perfect. Three issues... yes, the lens cap is a problem. No solution I know of. Second, the viewfinder is not WYSIWYG. The mismatching is significant... though at least the viewfinder errors on the side of showing you less than what is actually captured. Third, versus Olympus's digital point-and-shoots, the C3040's form factor is large, which sometime discourages me from carrying it. So the search for the perfect digital goes on.

I took some pictures of my daughter whipping a bubble wand around in a circle. With a regular 35mm camera I would have wasted 10 shots using the same approach. I got some spectacular action shots which you can see at ..., userid=jpayne.Takes great indoor pictures. No problems with red-eye, and I am pretty sure I haven't even been using red-eye reduction. The Nikon Coolpix cannot be used for indoor pictures, if you believe the reviews.QuickTime movies are a great way to share an experience with loved ones. I use the 320x240 (I think) resolution with sound. 75 seconds of that produces about a 24Mb .MOV file, which QuickTime 4+ can read and play back. In order to share that with my family on the east coast, I had to fork our $29 to apple to get the quicktime pro, which allowed me to compress that movie. That quality goes down, but I was able to produce a decent movie with a size of 1Mb instead of the original 15Mb (this was a 45 second movie). Awesome.  The fact that sound is part of the movie is critical. The Nikon Coolpix 990 doesn't have sound with its movies.I copy the images to my laptop with a PCMCIA card. I just plop the smartmedia card into the PCMCIA card that's already inserted, and the \"Removeable Disk\" appears in Windows Explorer, and I can copy megabytes of data/second onto my hard drive. Don't waste your time with the FlashPath floppy adapter.I manage my images with ThumbsPlus by cerious software (...). For $75, this is a dream come true for photo management software. In addition to all the image manipulations you could ever want, it also allows you to (a) apply a similar operation to a whole set of images at once, (b) associate keywords with each image, (c) allows you to associate user-defined fields to each image. The result of which, you can perform queries of the form: \"Find all imagines with Mom, Dad and Madeline, in Hawaii, out doors, in 1999\". Up pops a slice of your image database in seconds. Sure beats combing through photo albums (that I never get around to putting together anyway!)I like the panoramic mode very much.  The software does a good job of stitching the images together for you.  You need the olympus card, though - the feature is disabled without that card.The camera is nice and small.---------------------------------Things I don't like:The lens cap doesn't automatically come off, so you MUST remember to remove it before you turn the camera on, or else you will hear a grinding noise as the camera lens tries to extend. I am already over this.You cannot zoom when you make QuickTime movies if you are recording sound.  When you try to zoom, it does a digital zoom instead of an optical zoom.  Why bother?The speed at which the camera copies images and movies to and from the smartmedia is less than inspiring. SO you will take a QuickTime movie for 75 seconds, and then wait another 45 seconds while the movies is copied to the smart media. Then when you want to play it you will wait another 45 seconds while it's copied back into the 32Mb internal buffer. I usually just play the movie back on my laptop, which can copy to/from the smartmedia in seconds (actually, it just plays the movie directly off the smart media card).Previously I had mentioned I had trouble with 128Mb smart media cards, but it turned out to be the card.  I wasn't able to determine the brand of that card, otherwise I would warn y'all about it---------------------------------You can go to ... and look for albums from userid=jpayne to see some of the photos I have taken with the camera.

I definitely do recommend getting at least one extra 128meg card. (I want four more so I can fill a CD with each photo session.) The write speed to the memory card is pretty fast for even the highest resolution providing it's JPG compressed. Maximum TIF formats however do take some seconds, but at roughly 10 megs per photo (compared to less than 1 meg for JPG), the time delay is to be expected. If you're wanting really nice photos to view on your monitor and occasionally print-out, JPG is fine. For serious prints however the TIF is of course best.Viewing the pictures on your monitor is simply wonderful (providing of course your monitor is nice too! ;) ). Even in very low light, using the flash will give you excellent colors and skin tones. I kind of hate to say it, but I'm starting to enjoy viewing photos on the monitor more than looking at developed photographs. (And I hated digital photos until now!)The weight is pleasing, not heavy, but weighty enough to feel solid. The software is great for uploading onto a PC using an USB port. (It configures itself as an external drive, working just like a normal hard drive, very easy to access and copy files. Tons better than the other digital camera I own.)I'm not thrilled about the mechanical zoom, it feels and sounds a little rough, but it does ok, so I can't complain (much). There are seemingly hundreds of little commands to learn (of which I've learned maybe 50 so far), but that's cool, it just means I'll be able to do more with the camera as I get more familiar with it. But it does come with hefty-sized manuals! I do think Olympus should include a case for it though, even a cheapy.Oh! The QuickTime movie capability is a blast! You will want plenty of lighting for that though since the camera's built-in flash won't work during movie taking. QT quality is actually reasonably decent, plenty good for quicky web emails and CD home movies (mono though, not stereo).Battery life is excellent! I have absolutely no idea how long a set of batteries will last since I lost track of the time used after a few hours. (Several hundred photos were taken and uploaded before the rechargable batteries finally got low.) I recommend a set of rechargable batteries along with a disposable set just to make sure. If you're like me you will begin thinking the batteries will last forever and then forget about needing replacements.Over all I feel the camera is well worth the price. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't as nice as the E-20 I'm drooling over (duh!). Everyone who has seen the photos taken by it are surprised of the quality.

It's simply a fun camera to use, and I'm sure I haven't even used half the features, yet!  I won't list every great feature because the reviews that have been posted cover everything in detail, but I will relate some of my experiences: - buy a 128 MB SmartMedia card, but only the OLYMPUS card will allow automatic stitching of panoramic shots.  The included 16 MB Olympus card has this feature, but the Viking 128 MB card does not. - buy a charger with 4 batteries plus 4 extra batteries.  Keep in mind that most people like to use the display all the time, so batteries will run out quickly.  I only use the display to review the pictures taken, 99% of the time I use the viewfinder to take the picture.  Consequently, I get great life out of my batteries. - the automatic mode works for just about every situation.  The only problem I've had was taking pictures of a Christmas tree with lights, which seemed to confuse the focus and every picture came out blurry.  I had to read the manual and when I put it on manual focus the pictures came out sharp. - although a large-capacity SmartMedia card will NOT increase the length of the video clips (75 seconds is the max), it WILL allow you to store several 75-second movies. - I bought a USB card reader that does both Compact Flash and SmartMedia.  It works so well that I've gotten in the habit of taking pictures of just about everything.  For example, I bought a power tool that I wanted to tell my buddy about, so I just shot two quick pictures, downloaded them, an emailed them to him.  \"A picture IS worth a thousand words\".  Popping the memory card out of the camera and into the card reader is a snap, and it doesn't use any of the camera's battery. - the included Remote Control makes self-portraits a snap; no more hurrying to get in position before the red light blinks; and you can take several remote control pictures in a row if you like.", "Date": "December 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "THE BEST!", "Author": "Ron Childs", "ReviewID": "R8LBJXRDP0N8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using digitals since they were invented, mostly Kodak because they had the most accurate color and all those things that make good pictures, a friend showed me their C3030 I was impressed and I read a review on the improvements made in C3040, the review didn't say enough good things about the camera, this is an incredible camera, it can be used by an amature to make incredible photos and has all the features the pros could ever use.  ....I'll be using this camera till it wears out, it can't get better than this.

A great deal of comparison shopping (and some time spent with a friend's Kodak which I found close to useless) lead me first to the C3030, then to the C3040 when it was released. First off, the enhancements to the C3040 make it definitely worth getting, if only for its storage-class USB interface. This means that you can plug it into a Mac, or a PC running Win 2000, Me or XP and access the pictures WITHOUT installing drivers. I can't say enough about how wonderful that is, especially given the flakey nature of some drivers I've encountered. Next up, the big negative: No built-in battery recharger. This, I don't like. It's too easy to drain the batteries accidentally with this camera. Definitely buy the AC adapter for it and use it any time you plug the camera into your computer. My experience is that this is when you're at the greatest risk of draining your batteries. It's also not a bad idea to get a set of rechargeable batteries. The video mode is nice, but be aware that a bigger memory card will not necessarily allow longer movies to be recorded. It seems that when you record a movie, it stores the video in its internal memory, then copies that to the memory card. I've gotten video of 30-60 seconds at a time, and that seems to be the limit. Another note on the video format: The QuickTime format that's recorded is not widely recognized. The Apple QuickTime player will play it, but other QT \"compatible\" apps generally don't. If you want to convert it to MPG, AVI or RM, you'll need to use either the full QuickTime app ([amt.] from apple). I've heard about, but not tried, a freeware app from abc.com which will also read these files. One would hope that future releases of this camera will include the full QT on the CD. One last warning: I found cheaper prices for this on the internet from an assortment of camera stores, but without fail, all those stores would only sell the camera at those lower prices if you bought an overpriced accessory pack along with it. Otherwise, they tended to claim that they were out of stock (in one case, I was told that the camera was discontinued (2 months after introduction!) and that I should get the C4040 instead).

I just bought this camera ... (factory refurbished).  I've owned Sony FD88, FD91, and Nikon 950 and without a doubt, this is the absolute BEST camera I've ever owned!  The shots it takes are phenomenal!  These shots coupled with a photo quality printer (I use an Epson 820) are as good or better than film.

The fact that the camera has quicktime movies makes it that much better.  I use a card reader to transfer my pictures to the PC and it's done almost instantly.  The only bad thing I would say about this camera is that the Zoom isn't long enough.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to those huge lenses on the Sony products but the Sony camera's  take poor action shots and you have to use Photoshop extensively to blow-up the shots to get decent 8 X 10 pictures.  The type and quality of the shots taken with this camera more than make up for the lack of zoom.  Plus, I've already ordered a 2X zoom to partially make up this deficiency.All and all a super camera and now with the prices so low...you gotta get one.

I love the Olympus camera products, just beware of the gray market Olympus cameras that are out there.  Olympusamerica.com provides you with info. on this, and provides the legit product numbers/serial numbers they place on them.  My lens cap works fine, some say it does not fit right, but I have no problem.  My telescoping lens did not \"grind\" like others have described; it does emit a slight mechanical sound though. Also, pictures can be erased or lock protected immediately after taking them, if desired.  The video/sound combo option is sweet, only dark in picture when indoors with NORMAL lighting.  Video too can be viewed/deleted using the cameras LED screen immediately after filming.  Just a note on the sound/video portion. I was having problems with a skipping and jumpy video product when viewing it from a camera/card reader to computer connection.  Turns out the READ speed is too slow for this, the video clip must be transferred from the cameras Smartmedia card to a file folder on the computers hard drive first, then viewed from the file folder.  David B, via-Olympus' e-mail Tech Support solved the problem for me on the first try, I truly thank him. When I tried them, the phone Tech Support didn't ask the right questions, and I wasn't smart enough to provide the right additional info. The camera case Olympus makes for it is a little tight in the lens cap area, so a little larger after-market one might be a better fit.  Definitely get a 128MB Olympus Smartmedia card, it allows you to take so much more video/picture wise, and only the OLYMPUS SMARTMEDIA CARD has the panoramic capability, not the VIKING or others.  If you put a little time and effort into this camera to learn it's features and displays you will be greatly rewarded, but keep the book handy for quick referral. Finally, make sure you call the company you are purchasing it from first to make sure it's not GRAY MARKET, comes in the original box, and has all the manufacturers accessories (i.e. strap, lens cap, connection cables, CAMEDIA software, instruction manuals, etc).  Olympus does offer manuals online if you lose the original...I look forward to using this camera more in it's auto-mode, or if I desire, in it's full manual mode.

Users can begin snapping pictures immediately by just reading the quick start guide that comes in the package.

Moving pictures from the camera to my hard drive is as easy as clicking and dragging or copying and pasting.  There are many advanced settings, like aperture, exposure, etc.  I don't understand any of those yet, so I haven't touched them.  The camera is smart enough to make the adjustments for me.  Give me some time, and I'll start monkeying with the more advanced settings.I HAVE played with the resolution quality, and found it easy to change by navigating on the camera's menu.  I have also taken Black and White photos, color photos, and something called Sepia, which makes the photo look like an old fashioned picture you may have taken at Knott's Berry Farm or Disneyland.One neat feature that I found was the ability of the camera to capture sound and video in QuickTime format.  I took a 30 second clip of video at the office just for fun.  I don't know how much I'll use this feature, since if I really wanted to do a decent \"family event\" video, I'd go out and buy a digital camcorder, but it was kind of neat and easy to do.The only thing I didn't like was the battery compartment cover.  On a camera that has a very solid, almost German sedan-like feel to it, I was surprised that the cover seemed rather flimsy.  I sense that if I do not exersise care while closing the cover after inserting a new battery, that the cover may snap at the hinges.My wife was able to use the camera after only the briefest of tutorials, so that in itself was worth the purchase price.

This camera outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well. When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera. The C3040 sweeps the field. Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm. I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye. You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures. It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film. I show the pictures to professional photographers using ten-thousand dollar cameras and they are all surprised at how close the performance comes to theirs.  Low light capability is very good with the C3040.  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use. The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there. The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots. The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily. When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras. The 3040 improved its interface capability since the 3030 model.  You no longer need software loaded on a computer - plug in the USB cable and the camera is recognized as another hard drive for dragging and dropping files (or you can use the included software).  I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor. I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures). It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras. I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger...it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem. I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a glitch. One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it. Olympus has come out with a new model already to one-up this one.  I believe it's the C-4040, at 4.2 megapixel or something.
