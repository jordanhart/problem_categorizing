Shrader \"up all night\"", "ReviewID": "R2I4E2U6KQHOIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Kodak camera takes clean, clear pictures and is super easy to use.  It is small enough to fit in your pocket, yet feels durable enough to take a few drops on the concrete.  The battery life is ok, lasting all day when using it to take pictures of the kids at Disney World.  The only drawback is you can't use AA batteries if they do die.  I would plan on buying a backup battery just for this reason.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this camera if you are looking for a great little pocket cam that does better than your smart phone camera.  I wouldn't recommend this if you are someone who is into photography and looking for a point & shoot camera as there are better options available, but for double or even quadruple the pricetag.  Most of us, like myself, want clean, clear pictures of our friends and family doing crazy stuff.  This camera is perfect that!As for the software, I do not use it, so I can't review that.  I use Windows 7 and just download the pictures from the SD card onto my PC.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Price!

However, focusing seems to be a big problem. Just the slight movements even from a steady hand gives a blurry picture.You can alternatively use the \"Sport\" setting to sacrifice some quality for a less blurry picture.I do want to point out that the quality is really good only if the camera is immobilized such as on a tripod, etc.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera for black friday price", "Author": "AR", "ReviewID": "R3KDQHH9FFC95H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been taking some pictures with the camera and the pictures look good, nice and clear. Just know what setting the camera is on if it is in landscape and your taking a picture of something moving the shutter will be late, there is a setting for stuff that moves. The camera feels pretty durable but still light enough to carry. The battery is rechargeable which I would prefer since most likely I would have the camera in my pocket and don't want to carry AA's. It's a simple camera, if you are looking for something professional this is not it, but if you want something simple to capture everyday moments this is it. It's simple to use comes with a wristband. For the price and the simplicity this is a good camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Flash", "Author": "Laura B", "ReviewID": "R3VHBGTSK8W00U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera to give to my teenage daughter for Christmas.

When I first saw the Kodak M23 on Amazon, my eyes lit up. A 14 megapixel point and shoot digital camera with 5x optical zoom for $59! I bought two! I thought to myself, Hey, it's new, it's an upgrade, it has to be better than my M530\". Nope.I received my package and the camera's packaging was very simplistic, which I liked. Included is the camera, a wrist strap, the lithium-ion battery, a micro usb adapter and the wall outlet for the adapter, which..is pretty big. When I took out the camera itself, I was pleasantly surprised. I used a word to describe the camera that I rarely use AT ALL; \"Gorgeous\". The photo here does not do the camera any justice whatsoever. It is a bright shade of red in a high gloss finish and a chrome bezel (?) around the housing of the lens and the small size of the device gives the illusion that the LCD screen is larger than it actually is. Very sleek and sexy.I put in the battery pack, turned the camera on and was ready to shoot. What I appreciated right off the bat was how FAST it powered on. The lens just pops right out, literally. Of course for a low-budget digital camera, I didn't expect the camera to have a 'Retina Display' but the resolution is nice. I snapped a picture and was disappointed. The pictures come out very bright, almost too bright. On the computer the pictures look average, pretty decent, but when zoomed in to show the actual resolution of the photo, there is very little detail shown. It's as if you took an 8mp photo and stretched it to 14.1mp. My M530 wasn't giving me DSLR quality, but I found that is showed a lot of detail. When it comes to Smart Capture...if this is what people consider 'smart', we live in a confused world. When taking photos in smart capture mode, it's almost as if the camera has no idea of what is going on or what it is trying to capture. I took pictures out in daylight which were better but still lacked detail. Forget about zooming, it gets confused.I don't know if my standards are too high or if i'm being too picky, maybe I need to up my budget to the mid to upper range models, but this camera just disappointed me in more ways that one...basically in every way aside from the asthetics and its speed. This camera is pretty snappy (pun intended..don't judge me, lol) but that's pretty much it. There are 17 scenes to choose from:Portrait (1), Sport (2), Landscape (3), Close Up - which is a JOKE (4), Sunset (5), Backlight and Candlelight (6, 7), Children (8), Bright (9), Fireworks (10), Self Portrait (11), Night Portrait and Night Landscape (12, 13), High ISO (14), Panorama Left-Right and Panorama Right-Left (15, 16) and Blur Reduction (17)The M530 however had 22 which included 16 previously mentioned (aside from Backlight), Snow (17), Beach (18), Text- Which I LOVED for close ups (19),Flower (20), Museum/Manner (21) and Panning Shot (22)Would I recommend this camera?For those who appreciate just the looks: YesFor those who just want to take pictures: YesFor those who would like their photographs to have a decent amount of detail: NoFor those who like to have many options and scenes (that work): NoFor those who like to take close up photos: NoBy the way, I should make note that I love the feel of the buttons and the re-vamped design of the door for the memory card/battery. Very Nikon Coolpix-esque.**UPDATE**To add insult to injury, the camera's ability to charge has flown OUT the window. It will no longer turn on unless it is plugged in to charge. Talk about 'portable' -____- All i'm getting is a steady red light indicating that the battery is charged when in fact, it's completely dead.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent little entry camera with surprising features", "Author": "kk \"kk\"", "ReviewID": "R46XRSYF3Q22W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a nice entry camera, but I was surprised that it has advanced features like 5x Optical zoom and 14 mega pixels.

I landed on and purchased the Kodak EasyShare M23. I do like the camera it is easy to use and the pictures are clear and bright. Downloading the photo's onto the computer is simple. I have not taken a photo to share as of yet so have not had a chance to use this feature but am looking forward to being able to use this option in the future. Since this was the first digital camera I have purchased and I am not all that familiar with digital cameras I have to say I was disappointed in the description which indicated the camera has internal memory but did not indicate this would only hold about 4 photo's. Being unfamiliar with digital cameras I figured the internal memory would be all I needed then found out I needed to purchase an SD memory card. I think the description needs to be more specific in regards to the internal memory. Luckily I did not purchase the camera for a trip or special event since I had to wait additional time for the memory card.
