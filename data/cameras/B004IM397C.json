{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Handy and fun to use", "Author": "anoopster", "ReviewID": "R1TR7VQ1RZ3ZGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no CCTV technician. We're upgrading our 16ch DVR and cameras and got tired of running back and forth from camera to DVR troubleshooting the install and communicating with someone at the dvr by cell phone while I adjusted cameras wasn't really working.  This is also our first time using PTZ cameras and I had no easy way of testing that out until I found this unit.This does what it says it does--view camera image, control PTZ, power camera, and test connections. The menu command is a bit clunky and I found that I could access the native camera controls and some I could not but that wasn't a problem. Storing the bundles of cables and adapters is a bit of a nuisance too.The only real fault in the design is the orange rubber protective case restricts access to the 12v power out port which was remedied by drilling out a larger hole in the rubber case. You would think they would have noticed this problem though.For the money it was worth it considering the investment I was making in my new DVR and cameras. It made installing the cameras sooooo much easier.  My old system lasted 8yrs and occasionally camera's would go out so I figure I'll need this unit to troubleshoot problems in the future.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Please with the purchase overall", "Author": "doozer", "ReviewID": "R2799VC12ULXUT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Important to consider that once the rechargeable battery is dead, you won't be able to replace -- you'll have to run on power.  I found I wanted to be able to transmit color bars to set-up a monitor/tv, but you don't have the facility to do this.  The screen is great, the unit is easy to hold atop a ladder when you're setting up CCTV cams.

It's not a spendy high-end tester but for what we need it's just perfect as it does a bunch of things. I mostly like that it's rechargeable, that it powers 12VDC cameras so you can power/view a cam while on the ladder. It's been reliable so far; and it comes with a protective case, and a nice bag so it won't get smashed in the toolbox.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unit is ALOT better than the one we have been using.", "Author": "Daniel Mott", "ReviewID": "R1L57L946CLWQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact that the battery had not been plugged in prior to shipping, leading me to believe that the unit was defective (Would only turn on while plugged in)Once that was straightened out, the unit is perfect. I love the fact that it doesn't need to use 6- AA batteries that barely get me through a week. Havent had a chance to see how long the battery will last yet.Pros-Screen is large and looks greatUnit is very easy to useSetting allows you to pick how long the unit will stay on for before automatically turning off (5M, 10M, 20m, ETC)Built in batteryRubber caseCons-Battery charging duration is a bit much (If you plan ahead you'll be fine)Rubber case makes the unit rather bulky (I really don't mind that much just pointing it out)Storage case is made from low quality materials", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "SAVED MY BUTT and time and money!! awesome product fast shipping", "Author": "joel \"JAZZY JOEL PRODUCTIONS \"Quality eve...", "ReviewID": "R16ARKXFGO5X8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "quality, fast, will order again /// pro awesome super fast shipping great price to quality ratio.
