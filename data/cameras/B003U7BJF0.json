Cooper", "ReviewID": "R13VW07O8V9ZCE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm afraid my experience with the Kodak C122 was vastly different from the previous reviewer's.  I bought the camera as a birthday present for my 6-year-old daughter.  She doesn't know what she's doing with a camera, but I do; between us, we took about 40 pictures (half by her, half by me), and every single one of them had terribly soft focus (by comparison, my own inexpensive digital P&S; camera, a Canon A1300is, did just fine taking essentially the same shots).  The only nice thing I can say about the camera is that the flash did a decent job.  To make matters worse, the following morning the camera would not turn on.  I tried replacing the batteries, but it made no difference.It's pretty obvious I got a defective camera; maybe some are better.  But I wouldn't take a chance again.  I wound up spending a few dollars more and replacing this camera with a Nikon L22, which is just as cute (in her eyes) and takes much better pictures.  Oh, and it continues to turn on, too.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Ford", "ReviewID": "RN737K922VBR2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would never reccommend this camera to anyone except to use with kids as starter cameras. I bought them to use in our art room at school and I can tell straight away that they are made so cheaply it won't take long to start falling apart. The battery door is hard to close and is on the tiniest hinge that felt like it would break as I closed it.  The image quality is okay.  Forget about using the zoom, it gets very blurry after only zooming in a little bit.The one good thing is that it is easy to use.  With very few buttons and a large shutter I think it's an okay choice for beginners. However, it is small and looks like it's intended to be held with only one hand. Fine for coordinated adults, but I think kids will have a tough time steadying it with both hands without getting their fingers in the way of the lens.It wasn't my choice camera and hope that time will prove the quality of the camera wrong! :) At least they are cheap to replace.EDIT:I have had these cameras (I have 7) for a month or so now and I like them even less. All 7 are the same. Poor picture quality. 75% of the pictures are blurry or foggy looking.  Forget zooming!! I wish I had never purchased these cameras.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "i will never buy this camera again", "Author": "stephanie", "ReviewID": "R158D4T6S70AWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera is junk i brought it in and like 2 days it wouldnt turn back on so i send it back and got a different one...I WILL NOT BUY EVER THIS CAMERA AGAIN", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "CAMARA", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R3H3O1EG8TA1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MUY BUENO, RESPONSABLES GARANTIZADO, LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE TODO SUS ACCESORIOS ESTABAN EN SUI EMPAQUE, EL TIEMPO DE ENTREGA MUY BUENO", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review for Kodak C122", "Author": "Charles B \"Charles Bevan\"", "ReviewID": "RFO0YFJK64H26", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "One item that the other reviews neglected to mention is the battery life.  The camera takes 2 AA batteries and even when using brand new batteries the battery life is extremely short.I have used new batteries on several occassions and each time the batteries are dead within a day or so.The only good things I can say about this camera is it will accept a 32 GB SD card, that is the maximum SD drive capacity.  Also, as other reviewers noted, it is easy to use and is easy to carry in a pocket since it is small.I bought this camera at a garage sale for $8.00.  I can fully understand why it was sold so cheaply.  This camera is... Well.... Basically junk.If you are looking for an ok camera that takes mediocre pictures & you dont care about battery life, this is your camera!  Put it this way, had I known this ahead of time I would not have purchased the camera for $8.00.  Maybe $4.00 at most --- yes, it is that bad.Surprisingly bad quality on a Kodak brand name camera.  I could understand if the camera was made by Tyko or something, not Kodak.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!  Unless you can land one for $1.00 or less.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery eater", "Author": "DB \"groovemerchant\"", "ReviewID": "RNE8QVI7IZVSH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for my 7 year old , its a cheap camera and thats what you get .... does take OK pictures , what do you expect for under $50 but the bummer is the batteries are AA and maybe last 100 shots (less using flash). Fair warning to anyone looking at this camera. We used it on a recent trip and as you know kids take a lot of pictures and this camera is OK if you carry with you maybe 10-14 extra batteries with you.

It's a great work camera ( Photos for real estate ) or at birthday parties etc. I've dropped it and it still works well. You need to hold your hand steady when taking pics. Not for professionals, but for the price and for kicking around daily I'd buy another one.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever!

It's not too small to make handling fussy but easy to drop in a purse or pocket. The 8 megapixels is just right for the sensors producing clear and quality images. View size is more than sufficient at 2.4\" - who needs 2.7\"? Sheer vanity for extra money. Mine is red, cute and easy to find and not lose. Best of all this camera takes 2 AA batteries so you never need to fear a low battery when such readily accessible and cheap replacements are always around the house or at the nearest corner store!You will love, love, love this camera!
