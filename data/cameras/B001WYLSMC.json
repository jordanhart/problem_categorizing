{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good bang for the buck at under $70 on sale", "Author": "Magic Mike \"magic mike\"", "ReviewID": "R3FLFYDTWGTWAJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:  Inexpensive, decent pictures, good zoom, does with good quality audio, small size, good battery life, feature-rich for the $$$, accepts SD cards for low cost-high volume pictures or video capturing.Cons:  Controls are not intuitive, ANNOYING bright red light that precludes flash, rather cumbersome menu, 9.1 megapixel claim questionable.This is a good, decent, low-buck camera that's full of features.  At $[...] (the amount I paid) it does just about everything I need it to.  I added a 4 GB SD card for ten bucks and I can take up to 995 pictures (or about 35 minutes of video - or a reduced combination of still pics and video).  The 2 (AA) batteries last a good long time.  The LCD viewer is very clear.One of the biggest issues I had when first using this camera was simply taking a picture.  You have to FULLY depress the flash button to get a snapshot.  I took about 30 \"focus\" shots before I got a picture.  If you gently press the Flash button the picture simply locks into focus.  I had to read the manual to find out how to get a picture.  Just a little more muscle into the Flash finger, and 'Voila!' - photo produced!One thing I question is the 9.1 megapixel claim GE makes, as my 3 year old 3.1 Megapixel FujiFilm S2000 takes pictures that have *slightly* lower resolution - I say this puts together probably 5.5-6 megapixel at best.  Still for the $$$ I paid this is a great deal.So overall this is good for what it is - an inexpensive camera that lets you capture great moments without breaking the bank : and that's a VERY important thing in this economic environment.  Obviously it won't even come close in picture quality to the Canon, Nikon, Sony or other high end cameras.  If you're in the market for top quality pictures and extended lens capability - forget it.  This camera is not for you.  But for good, cheap, decent pictures - consider it a \"best buy\".

I found the menus very easy. (Read your manual, guys.) I bought a 16 GB SD card. Now this camera is also good for unlimited-time videos. I shot one that lasted 12 minutes. It's tough. I've dropped mine twice on concrete and it still works. The best thing is, it is very stingy with the battery consumption. Even 2 AA alkalines last a long time. No frustrations with this camera. My photos have been sharp.

Its easy to use has some nice features like the auto scene and overall user interface is quite good. Battery life is very decent. In good lighting the pictures are quite OK but try any thing in low light and the image quality drops sharply. Trying to capture night scenes is almost impossible, the images come out black and white almost no color. Flash photography is OK in ranges of 1 to 15 feet but there is a very serious picture to picture gap when using flash.Auto Focus works OK in most cases but misses the mark at least 10%. If you do have this camera I suggest taking every picture twice for redundancy. The 5X optical zoom is good and useful but forget about the digital zoom its horrible. Last and most annoying is the inability to control how much an image is compressed and processed. The images captured at 9MP undergo such heavy JPG compression that the quality is reduced to a 6MP camera equivalent. If I could select minimal compression i could live with the image quality but as its is now the 9MP is simply not being utilized to its fullest. Its a great camera for beginners, people who need an easy point and shoot and people on the budget. Its nothing more than a cool toy but for 70$ its definitely a good buy if you are looking for imaging on the cheap side. Would I buy it for myself - never.

Finally, the price had to be less than $120.I spent hours reading reviews from many websites but couldn't find a new camera that satisfied all these requirements for under $120. At first, when I found this camera on Tiger Direct's website, I was hesitant because it seemed too good to be true. After getting over the shock that it met all my requirements and the price was under $100, I decided to buy it.Can I tell you that this camera has amazing clarity.

I work as a DJ and often have the need to take pictures, but don't want to lug an expensive camera into a bar(They get stolen or beer soaked). I didn't want to spend a lot of money, on what was technically a \"spare\" camera even though it is the only camera I bring to work.That said:  It's a decent camera. It uses AA batteries so you'll rarely be in a situation where you can't find batteries. The picture quality is passable. Much better than a Camera Phone, not nearly as nice as a $150-$200 camera.The auto-focus is hit or miss. Overall, I can see it being a major pain in the butt if this is your only camera. This is not the camera you want to use to preserve \"once-in-a-lifetime\" events. Make sure you can re-shoot if necessary, or that you can live without the picture.For snapping photos of people singing Karaoke, dancing or an occasional photo-op... it's a great little camera to have around.It's loaded with features that make it fun to use.Well-planned out buttons and menus.If you're capturing your child's first steps, or documenting your biggest vacation ever... pony-up the cash and buy a real camera. (Even a low end Panasonic Lumix takes much better pictures, at only $50 more. (Remember, mega-pixels are a selling gimmick, and have no effect whatsoever on the image quality. Image quality is based on the Lens and the Image Sensor and the internal electronics, all of which are budget grade in this camera. 9.1mp of noise is simply noise.)As a camera to keep in the glove box for those unexpected photo opportunities... It's a no-brainer. You won't find a more feature rich camera with passable results at this price (I paid $[...] w/free shipping)", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Smile!!!", "Author": "Peter Penn \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R3DHHMCD1DFJA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I picked a cheezey title but this camera is way more amazing than some are giving credit for.  Occasionally I'll get a blurry pic if I'm not careful but most of them are way beyond what I expected.  I've had a walking person in mixed light turn out blurry, probably, because I wiggled or because of the mixed light but I also caught a mountain waterfall with bits of flying water stunningly frozen in time.I have a nice Canon XTi DSLR and a very nice lens for it that I got for nature photography.  Trouble is, on most backpacking trips I have enough weight already so I bought this little GE jewel for portability that I could keep handy in a front pocket.  Unless I expect to need serious magnification, the DSLR will stay home and might even get sold if idle for too long.I'd read in one or two reviews that having the camera set on full 9MP might make it more apt to blur so I set it on 5MP for now.  Honestly, the menu is not so difficult if you study it a little.  It is definitely way easier than most I've seen but still manages many features.  It doesn't take long, even without peeking at the manual, to scroll through every part of the menu and get a complete understanding (but do read the manual).  I admit I had doubts about the \"smile detection\" feature and didn't even notice it has its own button till a couple days ago when I tried it.  I wanted to get myself in a group shot and forgot where to turn on the self-timer.  Rather than look in the menus, I told my friends to not smile till I got in the pic and gave them a cue.  I pushed the :-) button, pressed the shutter button halfway down to focus, then pushed it down, and walked over and got in the group.  Then, as soon as we all smiled, we heard the shutter trip. Haha!  It worked and even served as a self-timer!  I guess for serious or scowling shots, I'd have to use the real self-timer.Anyway, after reviews I'd read had me thinking I might be returning this camera, it is definitely a keeper!  For those with the blurry shots, ALWAYS push the shutter button part way till it focuses, then take your shot.  If that didn't fix things, try lowering the pixel range to 5MP.  You still get a hi-def shot twice as big as a 17\" monitor screen and needing to be reduced.I don't expect this to send my HD video cam packing but the little video shots I've tried were also very impressive.  I'm wishing I had thought to take a 5 second moving snapshot of that waterfall.  I'm sounding like an ad.  A short review would be too short.  Lastly, a tip... if you try to get a macro shot of a flower and have trouble focusing, put your hand beside the flower and focus on it, hold that focus, move your hand, and shoot the flower.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "GE A950-BK 9MP Digital camera A+++++", "Author": "Clem", "ReviewID": "R196EU4A8HGEAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are very pleased with the operation of this camera.

If you have an average smartphone or camera phone(at least 5MP) you don't need  to buy a digital camera. That being said I have a below average Straight talk phone, but the camera is 1.2MP with NO FLASH, resulting in grainy dark pictures. I sell a lot of stuff on ebay so I need good pictures, clear and bright. Going to the store nets you a 40+tax dollar 5MP piece of junk that is all plastic with some no name brand.And it's tricky to make sure what kind of storage card you will need too. Fortunately this uses both a standard SD and SDHC which everyone uses for many different things now. I'm using a micro SD with an adapter on this with no problems, another plus. The connector is the typical smaller camera one, which is a pain. If this had used standard micro USB to PC connector it would be better.9MP is about 4MP more than anyone needs for normal use so it's a bonus. Materials are high quality heavier plastics and metals.
