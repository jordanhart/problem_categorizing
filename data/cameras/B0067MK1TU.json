Parrish", "ReviewID": "R2BQ3RDH29L874", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little jewell is just sitting there amongst the better knowns glittering away and I want to call some attention to it!!!  The big selling point here is the onboard processing chip. The advent of High Definition in Skyping has sorely taxed many a users computer system and given less than steller results.  Since most of the processing required to display a crisp 720p image to your family and friends (and face it who needs the wrinkle and wart revealing microscopic examination of 1080p???) 720 is good enough to make you and your environs look great without too much detail to give away the game, adding an onboard processor immediately translates into much more fluid camera operation in Skype mode and better picture and sound overall. It's Skype certified and has auto focusing (that works) and a noise cancelling microphone to make the conversation clear and distinct.  It costs less than the competition and does the job without a lot of bells and whistles.  There are millions of us I know who don't want the camera to phone home or update our facebook page just Skype us a decent conversation that looks good and sounds good.  This Creative Live! Cam accomplishes that while freeing up the processing in your own computer to handle other things.  I had a usb problem with the first one they sent me and Creative promptly replaced it overnight in a show of some of the best customer service I've experienced in this field (try microsoft or logitech if you want nightmares).  I cannot recommend this cam highly enough.  From fluid 720p skyping with software with plenty of sfx that feature cool video and voice effects and stunning single camera pictures...not to mention that it can be used as a surveillance system for your home or busines too...this baby does it all at a price that won't break the bank!!", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Creative Live!

It is small so it fits nicely in the laptop case and it sits nice on a flat surface so I have no problem with where to put it.

Cam Connect", "Author": "midnight821", "ReviewID": "R2LNQH3YGHM57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you have used Skype or other video calling/conferencing features long, you soon realize that built-in web cams in many laptops just don't cut it.  Some of them do fairly well with video quality, but then lack audio quality.  The Creative live! Cam Connect featured 720p video and noise cancelling features.  The Connect version of Creative's lineup is a camera priced in the middle range and offers features that take your video calling up a notch or two.Installation was simple and you are up and going in just a matter of minutes.  I used the camera with Yahoo, Skype, and Lync.  It performed well on all three platforms (although honestly, you should not have trouble on any platform as long as your camera gets installed properly on your computer).  The video quality was very good and on par with other cameras in the middle range.  The auto-focus was good as well.  Like many cameras, sometimes it can get confused and stutter for a moment, but generally speaking I was pleased with the focusing of the Connect cam.  While video was good, I found the audio to be a little below average.  While the noise cancelling did remove some background noise, the microphone picked up audio from all over the room, not just from the front of the camera.Overall, the Creative Live! Cam Connect is a decent camera that offers some advanced quality that many built-in webcams lack.  Video: 4/5.  Audio: 3/5.

I had multiple problems with this camera, one, being one with the camera itself, in that, I don't like the wide angle, if I stand up, it's really hard to get my whole body in the picture, which most of what I use my cameras for is shooting dancing videos for practice, so I need to be able to see my whole body, at least most of the time, on top of being very laggy, even for a webcam.  The video quality itself was pretty good, though the mic that it has on it is pretty sub par, and the software that comes with it really slows the camera down, a lot.  This is advertized as being good for skype, well, I had so many problems with this camera trying to even get it to work on skype i gave up, it just wouldn't work, I am sure I will sit down again soon and give it another go, but I got very frustrated in general just trying to get the video to even work on this camera for skype.  I also did not find the interface for the software very user friendly, and had issues being able to figure out how to do much of anything, which is a lot of the reason I had so many issues with this camera.  This is just not a camera i would recommend, at all, its just so buggy.

On an older computer monitor the inferior video is not that noticable, and is good enough for basic webcam functions like chatting.  The audio is clear.The webcam is small and is designed to lay evenly on top of any monitor.  That it does, although by the looks of it one would think it would fall off.  I had no problem placing this on a desktop or on a laptop.  The camera is well-balanced and the material \"clings\" to the monitor.Software is easily installed on a Windows7 system with no flaws.  One complaint I have is the short 4' USB cable.  Our CPU is on the floor and the monitor on the desktop, making the reach almost too short for front-end USB connection and limiting the position of the CPU to the monitor.  But it's not a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.The current price of this webcam is USD59.  This device should be no more than USD39, maybe even USD29, due to other webcams with 1080p abilities.  I predict a price drop on this soon, and unless newer computer systems will make 720p technology even fuzzier, I would be willing to recommend this product as it performs webcam functions very well.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy Setup / Good Quality Image / Does The Job For Me", "Author": "frankp93 \"frankp93\"", "ReviewID": "RDN0Q1DRCLS27", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a minor glitch installing the driver on 64-bit Windows 7. When I first plugged in the USB cable Windows correctly identified the cam. After installing the bundle however, Windows lost device recognition until after I rebooted - not a big deal but something to be aware of.The USB cable is about 4 feet long. I wish it were a couple of feet longer for my setup. If you don't use USB ports on your monitor consider the distance from the camera mount point to the nearest port. I can only reach a port on the front of the PC by running the cable across my desk surface, which isn't ideal.The software bundle includes two remote access streaming services, GotoCamera and mobilecamstreamer. These allow you to monitor your cam via mobile phone or another PC to keep an eye on your home while away, children, elderly parents, pets, etc.The client software is easy to set up and GotoCamera offers a free basic service. However, I'm primarily interested in creating instructional music videos and still shots and don't have much use for remote monitoring.Creative provides a 'Live Central 3' app for basic video and still capture with integrated upload to youTube. It includes a set of basic editing controls - it's not Photoshop, but the equivalent of software you might get with a scanner: adjustments include contrast, gamma, brightness as well as something called 'face softening' - a soft focus effect. I found the app very intuitive to use.Camera quality is not crystal clear but it's more than adequate for my needs. While there's noticeable visual latency when playing a musical instrument, I realize I'm capturing and playing back concurrently so that's to be expected, as opposed to streaming a compressed video a la youTube.All in all I'm satisfied with how easy the setup was and the overall image quality.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comparable to a low- to mid-range Logitech webcam", "Author": "FaceForRadio", "ReviewID": "R2EPY8TBQ779R9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't know how I ever got to be picky about webcam image quality, but apparently, I am. I compared the Creative Live! Cam Connect HD 720p Webcam to a couple of webcams that I own, a Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 and a older Logitech, the E2500. The Creative webcam's image quality is better than that of the E2500--let's say 50 percent better--but its image quality is much poorer than the C910's--let's say 75 percent poorer. I use a webcam nearly every day to Skype with a distant co-worker, and my co-worker recognized that I was using a different webcam before I mentioned it. The C910's optics are much, much sharper.However, I was interested in the Creative webcam's tout of its hardware encoder, which potentially meant that it might work better on my son's ancient Pentium 4, Windows XP system. It didn't really have any benefit that I could see--if I increased the resolution to its maximum, the frame rate dropped to an almost unusable rate. At lower resolutions, the image quality suffered.The Creative Live! Cam Connect HD 720p Webcam's build quality is just okay--it doesn't feel substantial. Again, compared to the C910, it's inferior.I can compare this webcam only to the ones I own, but I can guess that it might compare to one of Logitech's lower- or mid-range models, like the HD Webcam C615, but that model costs $20 less. The C910 (and now the C920) cost a bit more than this model, but it's well worth the difference. If money really is tight for you, then I would probably recommend one of the Logitech models.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hard To Recommend When The Much Better Logitech C920 Is Just $16 More!", "Author": "Amazonian Consumer", "ReviewID": "R1050FJO8UJ8S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Creative Live! Cam Connect HD is a very small (2 3/5 X 4/5 in.) webcam that you can attach to the top of a stand-alone LCD screen or notebook monitor, and connect to a computer via USB interface.The market for name brand external webcam is dominated by Logitech and Microsoft. While Logitech commands the high-end with its C910 and C920 products, Microsoft has the middle- and low-end with 5 webcams selling under $50. If you just need a 720p webcam, Amazon sells the Microsoft HD-3000 for slightly more than $26. The current Amazon selling price of the Creative is $64, while that of the Logitech C920 is $80. The price difference is so little that it is advisable to buy the Logitech for the following reasons:1. The Logitech C910/920 are better-constructed.2. The Logitech offers 1080p Skype video calling and recording, while the Creative offers only 720p.3. The Logitech incorporates image industry-leading Carl Zeiss glass optical lens, whereas the Creative is nondescript.4. The Logitech has stereo microphones, while the Creative has mono microphone.5. Performance-wise, in terms of video and audio quality, the Logitech is head-and-shoulders above the Creative, and the price premium is only $16.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good performance and a nice bundle but can't dethrone the C910", "Author": "J. Harley", "ReviewID": "R32QN2A7YNPFVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm comparing the Creative to the comparably priced Logitech C910 which I also own.Build quality:The build of the Logitech is much more sturdy and solid, especially the clamp.  The clamp on the Creative Live feels flimsy in comparison, although it does adequately support the web cam on the lid of a laptop.  However, on a thicker desktop LCD monitor, the Logitech fits much better.  The Logitech clamped securely onto the LCD but I had a hard time getting the Creative to fit comfortably on the same monitor.Performance:Both cameras offer 720P video calling (Skype, etc) but the Logitech offers 1080P video recording.  The overall quality of the C910 is noticeably better with sharper more vivid images and less noise.  The Creative by comparison seems grainy, dull and washed out.  There were no problems with movement FPS on either cam.  I also compared the Creative to a built-in webcam on a typical consumer-grade laptop.  The Creative blew away the 2MP stock web cam in pretty much everything, especially frames per second during video recording. About the only area the integrated camera could somewhat keep up was still images if the resolution was set to the highest and there was plenty of light available.  The Creative has pretty decent low-light performance although, once again, it's not nearly as nice as the quality of the C910.SoftwareThe C910 requires installation of the software before connecting the camera.  The Creative requires you to connect the camera and install the software afterward.  I had no issues in either Windows 7 or Vista detecting, installing, and using the Creative camera in Skype.  If you want more versatility, a little fun, creativity or security out of either camera, you can install one or all of the included bundled software.  This is where Creative finally edges out Logitech by offering a more appealing software bundle.  Logitech offers face masks, avatars, and special effects for video and still images.  Although somewhat fun, the video masks and avatars weren't the most precise and the remaining features were pretty much standard fare.  By comparison, Creative's Avatar maker is a re-branded light version of Crazy Talk (although they offer plenty of opportunities and prompts to upgrade).  I've already created several animations of myself and the dog that had my daughters howling with laughter. If you are interested in trying out Crazy talk and you're in the market for a web cam, this might be a nice package deal.  There is also facial recognition software and video surveillance software with the Creative.  The remaining software is standard fare, like Logitech.ConclusionIf you're in the market primarily for a web cam first and foremost and performance is the most important factor, then it's really not a contest.  It's hard to choose the Creative over the much more solidly built and better performing Logitech C910 or even C920 at the current price points.  Currently, the difference in price between the Creative and two Logitech models is less than ten dollars and twenty dollars respectively.  That to me will be the biggest hurdle for the Creative.  Unless you really want (or need) the better bundled software, it's hard to choose the Creative over the C910 or C920, especially if you plan to do a lot of video chatting or web blogging and want the best quality.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Web Cam great", "Author": "ken bargar", "ReviewID": "R3NCJ8SYTJC4M6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use Webcam for Google hangout, easy to install, small size fits on top of display, control  app easy to use", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "Jason Rambo", "ReviewID": "R2JOA3R8UU7VY1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Plug and play but auto-focus and auto brightness control fail at a high rate in my experience using the drivers included in MacOS.

The auto focus is actually really good and quick reacting; even the install microphone does a good job of picking up voices in a room with some considerable background noise.  So for a camera with basically outdated technology, it does a decent job, if you can use other software.I say that because the software that comes with this camera is abysmal.  Not only is it super slow to install, it is slow to boot up.  Slow to operate, and slow to close, there are much better free products to use out on the market.
