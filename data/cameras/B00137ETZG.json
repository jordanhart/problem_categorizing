If your source camera picture is very dark you will NOT GET VIDEO FOR THAT CAMERA, should not be an issue for infrared cameras3. Frame rate is about 2-4 fps for 4 connected cameras4. Connection must be in USB 2.0 and made to a desktop computer or powered usb hub since some laptops might lack bus power5. Interferance with other devices plugged into the same usb root hub has caused some issues6. If your source camera outputs 510(H)X492(V) 420 TV Lines you will be scaled down to 320x2407. Supplied software is poorly designed yet packed with features, difficult to navigate with no help file, software is not practical, the window can not even be draggedAll in all for $100 bucks you really can't beat it, and ive tired and purchased other products, including 2 of these DVRs and they have scored very low. The best bet is to save your money for a higher end DVR, however if you want a simple, quick fix, and not to mention least expensive option this will work just fine.I hope this answers some questions and concerns you might have regarding this product, happy shopping =)", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money OR TIME on this DVR", "Author": "K.

If you connect more than one camera the overall picture quality goes down! Why should the picture quality go down (becomes black and white) when you connect more than one cam (the frame rate, yes, but why the colors!)? Secondly, audio does not work, neither in the monitoring nor recording mode!  Add to all of this that it's expensive!  I had thought if it is the most expensive USB DVR, it must be the best; I was wrong; don't make the same mistake!", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Frustration don't waste your time", "Author": "Gregory Millerq \"GregR\"", "ReviewID": "R1ODSKJO7GSTHY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this in December its now April and emailing for support and \"invalid pointer\" issues, I have about given up and to toss this thing, lack of true support and any clear directions makes this useless.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horrible software", "Author": "Steve Lindsley", "ReviewID": "R29S1CEU577X3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hardware seems to work fine but the software is finicky and barely works(XP on a laptop).
