{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome DVR", "Author": "John B", "ReviewID": "RWAN9Q3JNA06P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be the third VITEK dvr that we have used, in the company and at home locations.  Let me start by saying that VITEK probably has the BEST technical support that I have ever experienced.  They always answer the phone and always know exactly how to fix the problem, that alone is worth the cost.  Product quality is the best.  We have 8 cameras, inside and out at our office.  With this DVR we can view our office anytime via iPhone, Android, or a simple website IP address and it is a live feed.  Must warn you that if youre not experienced with I.T. then you should have someone in the profession set it up for you if you plan to use it over the internet or phone apps.  After getting the new unit plugged in, the online set up took approximately half an hour and we were all up and running with live streaming camera feeds.  We only use ours for basic non stop recording so I can not get into the advanced recording, but this one does offer it.  I say well worth the money.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,410.00", "Features": "8 Video Inputs with 1 Main, 1 Spot Monitor Output and 1 DVI output.\nSupports both Dynamic and Static IP Addresses\nUp to 240 IPS Recording / Live Display\nRemote Viewing over the Internet, LAN, Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Opera (Blackberry) and Chrome\nApplications for iPhone, iPad, iTouch and Droid Devices", "Name": "Vitek CCTV VT-EH8/1T 8 Channel H.264 DVR with 1TB HDD and Real Time HD1 Recording", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ga2JTe3nL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003538R2C"}}
