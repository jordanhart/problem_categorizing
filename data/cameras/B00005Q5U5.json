Siciliano", "ReviewID": "R3FNKRNS8Q1NNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot G2 is a digital camera consumer's dream come true, and a nightmare for other digital camera manufacturers.Make a list of features you'd expect and not expect to find from a \"prosumer\" digital camera, and chances are you'll find them on the G2. This is a little camera that was designed to act a lot bigger than many other digital cameras in its class.You only have to pick up a G2 to realize that there's a lot more to it than meets the eye; this camera's significantly heavier and feels sturdier than any other camera in its class! The extra weight means better camera stabilization. The G2's sturdiness inspires confidence and makes the camera feel like a photographic tool, not an electronic gizmo.From the tilt-and-swivel LCD, the magnification loupe for manual focusing, dedicated and fully functional flash hot-shoe, evaluative metering, IR autofocous assist mechanism, ISO 50, RAW image format, etc., etc., this camera has it all!.Many photographers will argue that the real measures of any camera lie in the controls and results. The G2 doesn't disappoint in either of these respects. Although you'll have to familiarize yourself with the camera's controls initially, you'll soon find them very intuitive and actually use them more often than not.The quality of images captured with the G2 is nothing short of superb! You'll get clean, detailed, very high-resolution photographs with the G2, especially if you use the camera's RAW mode at ISO 50.The Canon PowerShot G2 is still a point-and-shoot digital camera. Anyone who's ever used an SLR will miss the optical viewfinder, true manual focus, and lens selection not available in the G2. However, this can be said for any other digital camera in the G2's class. In every other respect, the G2 rises above its inherent limitations and really challenges its competition to try and keep up!Beyond the camera itself, Canon has really done the consumer proud by offering most every accessory that you would want included at no extra charge, i.e. an remote control unit, high-capacity rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, and remote capture software.If you're in the market for a capable digital camera at a reasonable price, thank Canon for making the choice really very simple.Positives:- extensive feature set- excellent build and design- superb results, especially in RAW mode at ISO 50- Excellent lens produces very little distortion and chromatic aberrations- extremely reasonable price- All the accessories that should come standard do come standard.Negatives:- Certain exposure adjustments, i.e. flash compensation, aren't available in full manual mode.- The fact that the G2 isn't an SLR.- Not much else.", "Date": "March 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good digital camera, but much room for improvement", "Author": "Tan", "ReviewID": "R3G6D2P4WVXF23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer.  I own a Minolta 3xi SLR, and this Canon G2 is my first digital camera.  I have done extensive research on 3MP to 4MP digital camera.  The final candidates are: Olympus C-4040Z, Canon G2, with G2 being the winner.Things I like about G2 (from personal experience):- swivel LCD very useful in quite a lot of situations.- swivel LCD protects LCD when not in use.- long battery life.  I have bought an extra battery just in case, but I have never used it so far (I have been using G2 for more than 3 months now).  On average, I can use one charge for about 200 shots, with 50% of shots taken with flash; or > 300 shots on normal usage.  I think I will use the extra battery when I go on travelling...- manual focus magnifies the subject, thus allowing easy and accurate focusing.- ability to show 9 thumnails at a time, and ability to let you jump 9 photos forward/backward at a time.- remote control comes very handy.  The downside is: I always forget to turn on the remote control feature on the G2, and I wonder why my remote control is not working...  I wish future cameras will allow use of remote control, without having user to remember to turn on/off the remote control feature everytime he wishes to use it.- G2 normally produces good and sharp photograph.Things I dislike about G2:- slow to focus: causing me to miss many great photos.- unable to auto focus: the camera could not auto focus during night time even with street light.  The G2's light assist does not help much and is of little to no use.  Fortunately, manual focus is available.  On another situation, I cannot auto focus on subjects are close (less than 1.5 foot) to the camera.- video recording has max time limit of 30 seconds.  This is useful for short clips, but generally videos require much longer than 30 seconds block.  Note: Olympus C-4040Z has no video time limit.- unable to zoom in or out after you have started video recording.  However, you can zoom in or out before starting a video session.- flash insufficient.  When taking indoor pictures, flash assisted photos will look artificial, and gives you a feel that there is insufficient light (i.e. subject too bright, background too dark).  I have read that adding an external flash will solve this problem, although I have never tried it.  In the meantime, I use Night mode to compensate for this artificial lighting.  With Night mode, your photo will look natural.  The drawback is: the subject will need to stay still a little longer for the shot, so that there is more exposure for the darker areas.  Unfortunately, my subjects do not always stay as long as I want them to.- auto stitching does not work very well.  Initially, I was impressed by auto-stitching.  But upon further examination, I find that the stitching is done correctly only on certain parts of the photo.  For example, auto-stitch is done correctly at the bottom half joining two pictures, but somehow auto-stitch did not stitch the top half correctly (i.e. top half is misaligned).  In all, I would give auto-stitching a B- to C+ grade.- photos taken tend to be more magenta in color.  Fortunately, I can resolve this by setting Saturation level to Low (from Normal).- noise found in higher ISO.  Generally, G2 produces good quality photo at ISO 50 or ISO 100.  I do not recommend using any ISO higher than 100 since I experience a lot of noise at these higher ISO.Summary of main points: G2 is an above average digital camera for an advanced amateur, with many bells and whistles to play with.  3x zoom might be a little too small, but sufficient for most shots.  Main problems of camera are slow focusing and sometimes inability to focus.  Strengths of G2 are swivelling LCD and sharpness.  Considering its price, it gives good value for money, but there is much room for improvement.Note: You will definitely need a 128MB CF card.  32MB just isn't enough for a 4MP camera.", "Date": "October 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Finally! A worthy replacement for film", "Author": "R. Smith \"Cryptosmith\"", "ReviewID": "R26XIJBD36DI0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my G2 for about 3 weeks and (thanks to a Big Event) had the opportunity to pump several hundred images into it over a four day period. Once I got used to it, I found it to be a very satisfying replacement for other cameras I've used (SLRs, digital video as replacement for still camera, point and shoot compacts).I especially enjoy taking candids in available light, and this is the first compact camera I've used that actually lets me do this effectively. This is because I have reliable control over the flash and I can review pictures taken in questionable light to see if they worked or not.I also used the G2 on a tripod to make a photographic copy of a large family oil painting, and the results were about what I'd expect from typical 35mm film in the hands of a casual user. I used the \"remote capture\" mode with a laptop, and must say that this mode works, but not as smoothly as you might expect.When using available light, I admit I'm disappointed that the ISO setting maxes out at 400, but in my experience that's usually been enough, especially with an f2.0 lens, and the G2 can generally provide f2.0 (though you lose that maximum opening at longer focal lengths). The G2 gamely tries to take pictures even when the light is a bit too low, and it simply tries to warn you to hold the camera extra-steady.The low-light picture results were comparable to what I achieved with film - some sharp, some blurry, some grainy, often depending on the quality of the lighting. The level of detail I achieved in my JPEGs was comparable to what I'd seen under similar conditions with a good film camera.I often ran the G2 in \"slow motor drive\" mode since this would allow you to take several pictures in a row. Otherwise the camera would pause dramatically between shots as it pushed the previous image onto the compact flash card. In a sense, this was the biggest adjustment I had to make to this camera -- its computer would occasionally go off and do things, leaving the camera insensible to my need to take a picture, and I'd have to wait a second or two for it to catch up with me. The motor drive mode helped minimize this problem.Of course, the digital camera, and the G2 in particular, carries benefits that were only fantasies in the world of film. I installed a 256K CF card, and the thing held HUNDREDS of pictures! And even though I overused the motor drive setting, I could go back and discard the less interesting pictures WITHOUT WASTING FILM. So by the end of my 4-day event, I had already edited out many of the less promising pictures I'd taken.Another G2 shortcoming is that there's no way to change the orientation of a picture stored on the CF card. Even if you tell the camera which way to orient a picture (there's a menu entry), you lose that information if you simply copy the picture off of the CF card. I found that surprising. (For that matter, today's smart camera ought to sense which way is up, and store the image appropriately.)In closing, let me comment on battery usage. I bought a second battery and didn't start using it till the THIRD DAY of shooting! Note that I mostly relied on the viewfinder, and rarely used the flash. But I regularly used the LCD to review and edit the pictures I'd taken. I never plugged in the camera during the entire four days, since I'd already charged up the other battery. So you can push A LOT of pictures through a single battery charge.Plusses: the benefits of digital technology, film-like resolution, lots of control, a relatively fast lens, a usable viewfinder, awesome battery life.Minuses: ISO tops off at 400, the camera's computer can be slow, and you must use separate editing software to orient pictures. But I suspect the G2 is comparable, if not better, than most other digital cameras in these respects.", "Date": "January 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "One of the Best on the Market", "Author": "\"threeccd\"", "ReviewID": "R3MIDJKD6293RO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of exhaustive searching, I finally decided to purchase the Canon Powershot G2 (it's a wonderfully re-designed upgrade to the Powershot G1).  The clarity of the images that this camera takes is spectacular.  Combine that with the list of outstanding features that aren't included on any other digital camera: ISO 50, RAW image capture, a flip out LCD screen (which is much more handy than you would think), an infrared remote for long exposures and self-portraits, and easy menu functions -- this camera is without equal in it's price range.It's definitely not for the beginner, but, if you're familiar with photography, you'll be able to take sharp, beautiful pictures with this camera.  Skin tones are perfect and the built in flash with exposure compensation does a good job for portraits.  And, if you're considering a Sony, this camera uses the more inexpensive Compact Flash memory storage system.  Compact Flash memory cards are cheaper than the Sony Memory Stick and are compatible with more peripherals than Memory Stick.All in all, if it's in your price range, you will be very pleased with the Canon Powershot G2.", "Date": "October 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Probably the best \"prosumer\" digicam out there.", "Author": "Matt \"mattfl1\"", "ReviewID": "R3N2THLF3MIB56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After working with this camera at the store at which I am employed, I have come to the conclusion that all around, this is the best high-end consumer grade digital camera.  There are several ways in which this camera comes out on top over the cameras made by its competitors.More than likely, the camera people will compare this to is the Nikon Coolpix 995--at least these are the two cameras most people narrow it down to.  Each camera offers things that the other doesn't, but I find the Canon is superior in several ways.1.  The Canon is *far* more user friendly.  The controls are laid out in a way that makes them easy to find.  SLR users that are converting from film to digital will find the switch to be a little easier with the Canon.  One thing I don't like about the Nikon is the way manual control works; hold down this button, move this switch, push down that button while moving that switch, etc etc.  Way too complicated for the average consumer.  On the Canon it's a breeze.  Switch the control to \"M\" and the 4-way pad on the back up the camera controls aperture and shutter speed.  That's it.2.  The Canon uses an anti-reflective coating on the screen.  Nikon and Olympus *still* don't do that with their consumer grade cameras.  The anti-reflective coating helps heaps when you're out in the sun, where the screens on most other cameras get faded out and are impossible to see.3.  The rechargable battery that comes with the Canon lasts far longer than other camera batteries (i.e. AA's or the rechargables Nikon uses).  You could easily get over 200 shots from a single battery, with the LCD screen on.4.  The software package the Canon comes with blows away what Nikon and Olympus give you.  Adobe Photoshop--the standard in the graphics industry.5.  The Canon comes with a 32 megabyte card, which is 2x what most manufacturers ship the camera with.6.  Two words -- hot shoe.  Right on the camera.  Who wants to carry around a bulky flash bracket when you can buy a camera that a standard flash attaches right to?If you've read reviews from computer magazines or from digital camera websites, you'll see that the Canon gets consistently high reviews.  In a recent review, the G2 was rated #1 over the Coolpix 995, which the reviewers claimed produced pictures which weren't quite as sharp as the ones from the G2.  I've been waiting to buy a digital camera.  When I have the means, I am very confident this is the one I'll go with.", "Date": "November 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the Best Small Digital Camera on the Market Yet", "Author": "PhoneConnoisseur", "ReviewID": "R1CLGX3VN5VTRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot G2 is, hands down, the finest compact, high-end, amateur/professional digital camera on the market today.  Together with the lens adapter, the teleconverter (1.5x) and wide-angle lens available, it simply can't be beat.  Before I purchased this camera I spent several hours personally comparing it to every other 3+ megapixel camera currently on the market, and there is simply no comparison with any other.  I would not pretend to compare this camera to the Canon EOS D30 and the even newer D30x with it's use of interchangeable, incomparable EF lenses, but photography, not simply digital photography just leaped another millennium with Canon's improvements over the 1-year old PowerShot G1.The Product Review and other personal review at this site have provided you more of the technical aspects of this jewel, so I will spare any repetition--except to say that the ability to use my 550EX flash normally used with my Canon EOS-3 and 1v is not only teriffic but a great money saver.Don't be fooled by the stylish looks of other digitals--not that they are slackards by any means (such as the Dimage 7), but it's performance, although outstanding, seems elementary alongside the G2.ENOUGH SAID!", "Date": "October 9, 2001"}, {"Title": "A camera that will grow with you", "Author": "R. L. Lewis", "ReviewID": "R34X9XLZKFDRBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Canon camera and now I know what Canon fans have been raving about all these years. This is a well-built, well-designed, and well-executed digital camera. It certainly is intended for a advanced user or \"prosumer,\" but I believe it can also serve as a good camera for a beginner who knows he or she will advance in skill.Most beginners buy a point and shoot camera and then upgrade to something more expensive if they \"get into\" photography. The G2 can work as a point and shooter. It has a fully automatic setting. And the pictures it takes are extraordinary. At 4 megapixels, they are as good as any amatuer user will ever need given the capability of home printers.As you grow in confidence, and want to experiment with adjustments to shutter speeds, ISO, manual focus, etc., etc., it is all here and organized in a logical and accessible manner. The camera will even take short movies, though I doubt that feature is any more needed than the snapshot feature on digital camcorders.You need to hold this camera to really appreciate how well built it is. So many digital cameras look and feel \"cheap\" even if they cost multiple hundreds of dollars. The G2 is solid and attractive.I particularly enjoy the innovative LCD screen which flips out and rotates like those on camcorders. It also flips completely over for self-portraits (very convenient with the wireless remote) and can be turned toward the camera and snapped into place to protect the LCD from scratches while transporting.I researched several cameras before I purchased the Canon G2. I don't regret my choice in the slightest. The G2 is more expensive than some, but it is so versatile that I expect I will actually save money because I can't think of a thing I might need as my skills advance that this camera won't provide.", "Date": "November 24, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for budding photography enthusiast", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2J7O2UMDY2UC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for a budding digital photography enthusiast, somebody wanting a capable prosumer camera that you can \"grow into\".  It is simple to use (in full auto mode), yet highly capable (full manual controls).  I've done quite a bit of research into all the 3-4 Mega pixel cameras and I believe I had made the right choice in selecting the G2.Some things I liked about this camera:1.  Great LCD display.  I liked the capability of being able to close the lcd display, something other cameras didn't have.2.  Great batteries.  The Li Ion batteries last a long time, and can be charged in camera, like a typical camcorder (very convenient).3.  Easy to use controls.  The controls are intuitive and easy to learn.  I was shooting away in no time.4.  Good software.  I like the included Zoombrowser software that made it easy to organize and view your pictures.5.  Good manuals.  Manuals are very informative and well-written.6.  Very low shutter lag.  One problem with other digital cameras out there is the long shutter delay (delay from the time you press the shutter to the time the picture is taken).  The Canon G2 is FAST!7.  Slew of features.  It has a whole range of modes, starting from point-and-shoot automatic to full manual controls.  I use primarily the \"program AE\" mode which is the point and shoot automatic mode, but with the capability of making exposure, flash intensity, and white balance mode changes.  Great learning camera.8.  Excellent picture quality.  Of course, all the above wouldn't amount to much if the camera yielded poor pictures.

Honestly, I was looking at the Oly 4040 more seriously than this because it looked good on paper (specs).  Do yourself a favor - go to a camera store and hold the cameras.  Test drive them.  The Canon was a no-brainer for me.Compact Flash cards are a must.  Fast and convenient.  I picked up an additional 128mb card, and is well worth the investment.  I also picked up the telephoto lens, but in reality, I don't use it much.  Too awkward for the minimal gain.  Don't bother with the digital telephoto - as with most other cameras, it's lame.I've had this camera (G2) since October, and it is absolutely wonderful.  I needed to send pictures in word documents via snail mail to my kid in the military.  I can literally take a picture and have it imbedded in a word document (formatted too)in under 60 seconds.Besides the ease of use, the pictures are on par with most 35mm shots.  This has full EOS style programs, so it's very versatile and easy to setup.  My friends and family are really impressed with the quality of the black and white and sepia photos it produces.  I really like the auto-bracketing feature.The LCD is very nice in all lighting conditions.You can avoid the startup chime by starting the camera with the LCD closed, and open it after it wakes up.I have saved just over 600 photos to date.  Battery life is phenomenal.  As in WOW!  Excellent!  I've charged twice (approximately 700 pics taken).It's slightly heavy, which I like.  Good feel to the camera (unlike others on the market).I would also highly suggest that you get a CF card reader.

All the convenience in handling, maintaining and uploading wouldn't be worth jack if the pictures themselves looked better with another camera!And in this important department of \"quality\", I have always wanted to compare G2 and Nikon's top comparable options (specifically 995, 4300 and 5700) because these are the only two brands that'll give you near-pro functionality and quality at consumer prices (apologies to FinePix/Olympus owners).I had the luxury recently of trekking with friends who own Nikons 4300 and 995 respectively. Pretty much the ONLY thing I've found Nikon-freaks mentioning since the release of G2 is the oh-so-exalted Nikor lens because Canon beats Nikon hands-down in pretty much every other department as noted above. Me and my 2 friends are all more or less at a similar level of expertise with photography, none professional. But all have owned and worked with our camera for a while and read the manuals thin.Here is what I believe after head-to-head comparisons, your mileage may vary --OUTDOOR PICTURES IN BRIGHT LIGHT:Canon's colors were more real. Clarity is good with all 3 cameras but Nikon seemed a little reddish to me.PICTURES IN LOW LIGHTING (INDOOR OR NIGHT PICTURES):This is where Canon where truly leave you in \"shock and awe\" (sorry for the choice of words). I was stunned with some of Canon's ultra-realistic  pictures when only a candle was on in a room for example.FIGURES/FACES OF PEOPLE:Unfortunately, even with a lot of tweaking, Nikon is just simply better at faces of people for some reason. Canon is too, er, \"real\"? We agreed that with Nikon ...the colors, shades, contours of the same face can be made to look a little better than with Canon -- and I am excluding software based trickery of course.DEFAULT MODE:If you opt to use only the default modes in Canon and Nikon, then Nikon will win in terms of photo quality. Canon provides excellent detail and clarity, but the default mode has the now notorious \"white specks\" or dotted edges. This is easily taken care of with some adjustment (read the manual).ALL IN ALL: I feel Canon's results are more \"honest\". It just captures the reality in every sense-- colors, the range of what your eyes see etc. This usually means it is better for me, but if my pictures were going to be mainly of people I would also give the Nikons a good look.Otherwise, Canon G2 Powershot is the best there is. Even better than the new G3 (for now).", "Date": "April 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "A great camera for the average guy", "Author": "Mike Young \"hotrod29\"", "ReviewID": "R3NEZIAQWG54CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely do not understand why this camera ( G2) has received a few poor customer reviews.To date I have shot maybe 500 or 600 pics and somewhere around 25 to 30 two minute movies.

With the availability of digital print services online and locally, we decided to stop buying film. We started out looking for a \"cheap\" digital camera. But after weeks of research and 100's of reviews and hands on, we decided on 2 models. The sony dsc85 and canon G2. The canon reviews seemed better and we also liked the compactflash vs. sony stick. It's cheaper and we can use a microdrive. The canon is an excellent camera. The only negative thing we can find is the small LCD. But it more than makes up for it with it's swivel capabilities. Which can protect the LCD when folded away. LCD's can be damaged easily. Most film quality is around 4-5 mp range. And this camera beats out my 35mm SLR and scanner solution by far. I set the camera in the \"Program\" mode and I can select the type of lighting for indoors. This is great, as most pictures will have a yellow orange tint on most film and digital cameras. I can select Tungsten or flourescentetc. Anyhow, if your looking for a great camera with all the bells and whistles, best battery, photo quality then buy the G2!

Great camera for the serious digital photographer!  This is our second digital camera...We made the initial switch from our SLR to digital and have never retreated.The Canon G2 is a full-featured digital camera for those of us that love the control you have with a good SLR.  This model has all the manual adjustments for aperature, shutter speed etc., that you might be used to on your film camera.  At the same time, the G2 has many fully automatic settings for simple point and shoot, such as full program mode, macro (close-up), portrait, panarama etc.  In fact, if you are already a Canon SLR owner like us, you'll find many of the same controls you've already grown accustomed to.Features convincing us to purchase this camera over others include a flash hotshoe, rechargeable (in the camera) Lithium Ion battery, a decent sized 32MB Compact Flash Memory card, an excellent quality zoom lens and a really bright, adjustable LCD display.  We also like the ability to switch between various levels of color intensity similar to polarizing and other filters, as well as B&W; and sepia.  There are also settings to adjust for different outdoor and indoor conditions such as flourescent and incandescent light.  There are many more!A big surprise was the digital video recorder with sound.  I thought this would be little better than a toy, but the quality of images and audio were amazing.  Having said that, I wouldn't get this in place of a digital video camera, but if you occasionally like to shoot a few frames of video with sound to throw on a webpage it really comes in handy.So far we really haven't found a lot of downsides on this camera.You should pick up a larger compact flash memory card, but that shouldn't be too big of a deal with prices coming down....We shoot at 1600x1200 allowing us 219 exposures to work with.We also bought an additional Lithium Ion battery.  The Canon uses a proprietary battery charged in the camera.  The battery life is excellent allowing you to constantly use the LCD viewfinder and all features for more than a full day of shooting.

The G2 has it all, although an additional 64 Meg memory card is advisable as is a carrying case.  A 64 meg card should allow between 30 and 90 shots in the high-res range; thats a whole day's worth of shots.The G2 is very easy to learn to use and I've gotten great images. Overall, I really enjoy the slide-like color intensity when digital images appear on a large PC screen.  For that reason alone, I am finished with 35mm SLRs & print film.Indoor shots have been very impressive; I didn't expect it to be as good. I mostly take outdoor shots and so far I've been pleasantly surprised at the dig-cam's ability to pick up the subtle shadings in the natural world.  Thats my thing; I look for color and texture contrast virtually anywhere in the natural world.  I feel the digital camera does a better job of getting  subtleties of color than my 35mm SLRs did; a shocking thing to say, no doubt. Also, this camera has performed well in a variety of lighting conditions.  On a recent walk in the high Sierra, I got amazingly good G2 images with no special fussing with camera settings; it was fully on auto.  My 35mm SLRs NEVER seemed able to get that high altitude light quality captured.Then there's the quick-turnaround time.  With the USB connection, 30 to 50 high resolution shots can be downloaded to a PC in about 2 minutes, and they're ready to play with.

The image quality is astounding, I can easily make 8x10 photographic prints that you couldn't tell from a 35 mm. The shutter responds very quickly provided you prefocus on the subject, which I find no big thing when taking sports pictures. The controls are well positioned and logical. The inclusion of the RAW file system is a major plus for hard core image editing. I have bought the macro, wide angle, and telephoto adapters for this camera and they all work very well. The Macro performance is fantastic. This camera is absolutely perfect in every way except one, and this is a fault all digitals have not just the Powershot. This fault is that images taken above ISO 100 and noisy. HOWEVER, I highly recommend getting a program called Neat Image Pro that reduces noise in pictures if you enjoy shooting at high speeds.

This was a great deal at only about fifty dollars over the normal camera price.To begin with, the camera looks and handles like a classic camera, which is what none of the other 4 or 5 megapixel cameras can boast, with the exception of the Leica Digilux 1.  It has heft and controls which please the eyes and fingers of dyed in the wool 35mm photographers like myself.Secondly, it delivers on image quality.  Check the stats from the photography magazines and online camera reviews.  The G2 comes out on top every time in its category, period.  Sharpness, color accuracy, and contrast are all excellent.Thirdly, Canon delivers superb software with their product.  Zoombrowser EX is a well thought-out program that allows the user to group, sort, modify, print or show slides of images with ease.  It also coordinates well with Adobe Photoshop (a full version of which Canon also supplies!).Lastly, there are the little things that make a photographer happy if they are present in a digital camera and sad if they are absent.  Happily they are all present in the G2:  long, long battery life; excellently sharp and fast autofocus; accurate evaluative metering; manual override of autofocus; manual exposure control; the ability to add filters and other lenses (close-up, wide angle and tele); the truly wonderful swiveling LCD screen; and the ability to attach an accessory flash.Is this camera perfect?

Pictures of similar quality, only larger?  The ability to print large photo's without pixellation?What I didn't expect was not just larger pictures and larger prints, but absolutely superb images from almost every shot.  I have been impressed to the point that the thousands of other photo's I took, many of which I was very proud of, now look dull and almost comical by comparison.This is a fantastic camera, with a myriad of customization controls and super point-and-shoot capability.  If you want to play with the manual controls, fine, they are available, and really broaden your photographic repertoire.  If you don't, using the Auto mode, I've found, will produce a perfect shot in almost every situation.  My old camera had a problem, like a lot of older digicams, in low light situations.  Not so the G2, which will take a shot in almost complete darkness and render a decent, if not lovely, image.  With dim indoor lighting, the camera just takes beautiful pictures, completely unimpeded by the ambient light.The amount of detail, even incidental detail captured, is incredible.  One of the first shots I took in RAW mode was of the area overlooking my neighborhood, with the tops of houses in the foreground.  Looking at this same picture on the computer, I noticed what I thought was a dead pixel or two up in the corner of the sky. I zoomed in on that area, and zoomed in several more times to about 50X magnification, and lo and behold I had captured a fighter jet passing over our area!  I didn't even see (or hear) this jet when I took the photo, but the camera captured it in incredible detail.In another case, I shot a photo of the night sky, with several stars and what I knew as the planet Saturn in the frame (I also like astronomy).  Fair enough, when I looked at the picture on my monitor I did see the dots of light surrounded by blackness.  However, zooming in on captured twinkle of Saturn, I actually was able to resolve the rings at high magnification, something I have never been able to do with the naked eye!  Pretty amazing.There are a few cons;  the camera is heavy enough that I'm loathe to use one hand when shooting, as I could with my other camera.  You just don't want to drop it.  The screw-on lens cap is a nice touch to protect the lens, but couldn't they have figured out a way for the lens to unscrew itself and pop the lens cap when powered on?  I hate having to unscrew it every time.  In addition, in very bright sunlight, this camera tended to overexpose in Auto mode.  You should learn the different settings to make your shooting effective under these conditions.  I should also mention that this camera is not kind if you have a blemish or scars or any other item you usually find unnoticeable in other photo's.  The high pixel count gives you a very very large and sharp amount of detail, and you may find yourself wishing you had washed your face after the marinara if you are not careful.Although not a \"con\" per se, but worth mentioning, is that the G2's Jpeg files are very large, the RAW mode files even larger on average (although not as large as TIFF - thanks Canon)!  In just a few weeks of ownership, and a few hundred photo's, I managed to gather enough pictures to fill two 700MB CDR's.  This is more than I have filled in three years in the highest quality mode on my trusty old 1.2MP camera.

It is a great camera and I have taken probably close to 600 pictures since I got it less than a month ago. Of those, I've been able to immediately delete one-third of those pictures because of things I didn't like with lighting, closed eyes, etc.  This is something I couldn't do with my SLR camera and thus I will eventually save a lot of money in film developing costs and I will have better quality images.The pictures are incredible.  I compared similar pictures I took with my Canon Elan 7E 35MM SLR (a great camera in its own right) and my Canon G2 digital camera and I think the quality of the latter pictures is better.  Combined with the savings on film and developing and time saved by not having to scan pictures for editing in Photoshop, etc., the choice of going digital is easy.I do recommend that if you get this camera and intend to take indoor shots to get an external flash unit in Canon's EX series.  The flash that comes with the camera gives me significant \"green eye\" when I took pictures of my dogs (a common problem when taking pictures of pets even with film), even with the red-eye reduction activated, but the bounce flash ability of my Canon 380EX Speedlite reduces this problem significantly (the 420EX is the newest in the Speedlite line).Battery life is also not a problem.  I bought two additional batteries when I bought my camera based on the concerns voiced earlier about short life, but even after 600 shots, I am still working off my initial charge.  Granted that almost all my shots were indoors so I'm not sure how much drain there will be due to elements, but I have also taken them with the monitor, so battery life is pretty good.  You probably might want to get a second battery just to be on the safe side.Compact flash cards still can be pricey, but deals can be found where you might be able to get them for a good price and these prices will no doubt come down over time.  Viking Components compact flash cards are very good and fairly inexpensive compared to other brands.

I'm happy to report that the G2 produces images even at the simplest point-and-shoot setting that are so perfect- even cropping and blowing them up to 8X10-sized prints proves perfection (I certainly could not tell one from a 35mm image handled in exactly the same fashion.)  The picture stitching feature for creating panoramic images is first-time easy and fun- I only wish I'd had this the last time I visited the Grand Canyon.With the exception of the \"movie mode\" which is absolutely useless (don't buy the camera specifically for this \"feature\", as it produces laughable images that would not even be suitable as email attachments), I love everything about the G2.  I noticed something about this camera (and probably ALL digital cameras) that I wanted to share.I am lucky enough to have 2 different PC setups in my home.  The one I currently use is a high-tech DELL Dimension with a large trinitron monitor.  When I download images from the G2 to this system, I find the time very fast, and the images look wonderful without the slightest need to tweek them.  As an experiment, I tried downloading the same images to the \"off-the-shelf average\" Hewlett Packard PC and monitor that I started out with, and my whole experience seemed different.  It took what seemed like a long time to download, and the images looked fuzzy, poor color, etc.  If I had not already seen the beautiful G2 images on my DELL equipment, I would have returned the camera for taking \"lousy\" photos, without ever having bothered to try to print them up.  I point this out as I think some people blame the digital camera for the \"looks\" of the initial image, when they may just be looking at them with a \"not so great\" PC and monitor.  Make sure you print your photos on a good machine, with quality paper.The other thing I wanted to share was regarding \"after the purchase\" customer support.  This being my first digital camera, I had lots of new user questions.  I've called the Canon 800 customer support number several times, and each time I was helped by a kind and knowledgeable person who was able to answer my question(s) quickly and thoroughly in terms I could easily understand.

I instantly sprang for a SanDisk 256 MB CompactFlash Card and the Sandisk Imagemate CompactFlash Card Reader (SDDR-31) to download the pictures from the card directly vs. using the camera's USB connector.  The camera is also microdrive compatible, but I haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.  The prices for 1 GB microdrives are around $300.00 which makes it a really attractive accessory for this camera.The 3x optical zoom lens gives you a 35mm equivalent focal length of 34 to 102mm.  Another thing I love about this camera is the tilt-and-swivel LCD that's included.  The LCD twits around completely that will allow you to take some of the over-the-head, backwards, impossible shots.

The G2 also has a full TTL hot-shoe built onto the top of the camera to add another flash.  The bottom of the camera includes a tripod mount.The true camera geeks will be happy with all the possible exposure modes available on the camera.  Starting with the automatic exposure mode to complete granular control that the SLR provides, this camera will make everyone happy.  The scene exposure modes allow for presets to take portraits, pan-focus, landscape, and night-scene.  If you get this camera, you have to try to use the included Photo Stitch software to take those truly breathtaking panoramic pictures.In conclusion, this is a great camera that will give you years of great service and take fabulous pictures.  The only complaint I would have about this camera was the connectivity on my XP computer.  The camera includes a USB cable and software that is supposed to allow you to download the pictures from the camera directly, but I was getting some weird connectivity errors.  Since I already had the Sandisk CF card reader, I never tried to get this connectivity working.  But a lot of other people have this working and so this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.", "Date": "June 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"mayaangel\"", "ReviewID": "R33CFANPLS9PA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've been seriously taking pictures for over ten years.  i own several film slr(single lense reflex) and a trunk full of lenses, filters etc. i was apprehensive about down grading  from slr but did it because i did not want to spend over [$$$] for my first digital camera when i knew little about digital photography.  i was not even sure i would like it.  but .....this is a great camera! it has sold me for life!  if you are a photography enthusiast and you want a digital camera that is capable of giving you great shots and the  flexibility of an off camera flash, as well as more shooting modes than you will ever need, including manual mode, ability to set your white balance,auto bracketing,let's  not forget the rotating lcd which does come in handy,especially for self portraits! and so much more - for under [$$$]( i paid [$$$] before G3 came out) - this is your choice.  if you've previous owned any of the canon EOS slrs then you will feel completely athome with this camera! i've owned this camera for about 6mths, i deliberatly did not rate it right away. i'v never regretted my purchase.  my only complaint, and if you are reading several reviews you will have already read about the slower than desired auto focus.  once you get the hang of your camera and learn how to best utilize it,you can minimize this and you will be inspired by the great shots that you can capture.  for a non - slr - this camera takes superior images - it's no point and shoot - but it's not an slr.stop reading right here and go and buy this camera!  if you want to know more about digital photography and the G2 - check out dpreview.com.  this is an excellent sight! only for the  serious at heart digital photographer.recommended items: canon speedlite 420 ex flash a must!", "Date": "November 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera.

This camera has been so much fun to use that I've been taking it everywhere.  I consider myself to be quite the amateur photographer, and some of the reviewers here have stated if you want a point and shoot your money is wasted on this camera whose features can do so much more. I'm here to say that even if you are looking to buy a digital camera for point & shoot purposes, but are thinking about expanding your photography skills, get this!  I spent several months researching cameras, and this camera has been a dream come true. It is completely easy to operate right out of the box....so if you have been apprehensive about learning the tricks of digital photography like I have...no worries...the manual is easy to use and very user friendly. The greatest feature of this camera is the rotating LCD display. Self-portraits are quite easy, and when you are using the handy remote control to take shots of yourself with friends, you can zoom in based on what you see on the display. I have been having tons of fun taking black and white & sepia pictures, and experimenting with the exposure settings. A great companion to this camera is the \"Shortguide to Using the Powershot G2\", which I purchased through Amazon....it is extremely helpful to the amateur photographer who would like to learn more about taking advantage of some of the more complex features of the camera.  I purchased a 128MB Viking card with the camera & a carrying case; the 32MB card that comes with the camera does not hold that many pictures.

BUT...The red-eye reduction system does not work.  Instead of flashing twice, as most cameras do, the G2 projects a \"bright\" beam a light while you focus on your subject.  This beam is not bright enough to constrict the pupils in the first place, and is not wide enough to even hit the pupils in a typical composition.  You have to attempt to flash the beam in the subjects' eyes before taking the picture--very difficult to impossible.For this price, and considering all of the advanced features, I would expect better.  I cannot recommend this camera because of this egregious flaw.Canon G2 Owners: Please complain to Canon if this bothers you--maybe it could be fixed with a software upgrade.", "Date": "July 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera, if you learn to use it", "Author": "Thomas D. Kehoe", "ReviewID": "RMKKM59KVLE9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like my Canon G2's \"stealth mode.\"  Its f/2 lens shoots in low light without a flash.  Other digital cameras have an f/2.8 lens, requiring twice the light.  Plus the viewscreen flips out and rotates.  I can put the camera on the floor, against a wall, on a glass on a table, etc. allowing me to shoot at slow shutter speeds without a tripod. And because I'm not holding the camera to my eye, subjects don't realize I'm shooting pictures.  Lastly, the camera is completely silent.  Candid shots vs. posed pictures look completely different.  Posed, people make faces, stick out their tongues, etc.  Or they refuse to let me take pictures.  In contrast, in candid shots people look natural.Then after I take the pictures, everyone wants to look at the pictures. This makes you popular at parties. Even the people who said they hate pictures of themselves want to look through the shots, and they love the pictures!  I feel like saying, \"Duh, if you stick out your tongue and scrunch up your face when you pose for a photo, you'll hate the pictures of yourself!\"After using the Canon G2 you become aware of how obtrusive other cameras are: flashes going off, the loud snap of a 35mm camera, etc.I also like the video mode. It takes pretty good 30-second videos, with sound. And, again, people don't react the way they react to someone shoving a video camcorder in their face. They ignore the little camcorder, and then are delighted to watch the video.I like the \"continuous\" or \"motor drive\" mode, which takes up to 2.5 frames per second. For sports this is essential. For portraits it's useful: you tell the subject to smile, and you get a dozen shots to pick from, of every stage of the smile.The \"macro\" mode makes close-ups of little things easy.I also like that shooting hundreds of photos is free! The battery has never run out, and recharges quickly. But my 256MB card is too small. I'm upgrading to a 1GB card. As you learn to use this camera, you'll find yourself shooting far more pictures than you did with other cameras.I've used my G2 heavily for almost a year, and it has never broken down.My complaints about the G2:- The \"AUTO\" and \"P\" modes should not be used.  These set the shutter speed at 1/640th of a second.  This is much faster than is necessary, diminishing your depth of field, using the flash unnecessarily, etc. Instead, I taped a reminder to the back of my camera, saying to use aperture priority at f/2 and 400 ISO in very low light, aperture priority at f/2 and ISO \"AUTO\" (50 to 100) in low light, shutter priority at 1/125 and ISO \"AUTO\" in medium light; and aperture priority at f/8 and ISO 50 in bright light.- The \"auto\" white balance should also be avoided.  It often looks bad, often very bad. The manual settings (sunlight, tungsten, etc.) are easy to use and look great. I never need to use the manual white balance.- Using autofocus and autoexposure result in a half-second lag between pressing the shutter release and taking the picture. You can get around this by using the \"continuous\" mode, or using manual settings.- The G2's 34-104mm lens is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but there are times I've wanted a longer telephoto lens.- 4 megapixels isn't as good as a pro 35mm camera. For 95% of my shooting it's adequate, but sometimes I wish I had 5 or 6 megapixels.- 400 ISO is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but sometimes I've wanted more film speed.All in all, the G2 does 95% of what the \"pro\" cameras do, and does lots of things the pro cameras don't do -- such as not being obtrusive, or too heavy to carry around. Weighing these pros and cons, I'd take my G2 over the \"pro\" SLRs.--Thomas David Kehoe, author of \"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\"", "Date": "September 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2JGCWFMRDPEA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to purchase my first digital camera and originally bought a Toshiba 3.2 megapixel which claimed to provide photos equal in quality to 35mm cameras.  I was very disappointed. After tons of research, I purchased the Canon G2.  I am still amazed at the quality of the pictures.  It is easy to use and comes with everything you need.  Many other digital cameras come with 8 or 16MB cards which don't store enough pictures.  The Canon G2 comes with a 32MB card which holds about 19 high quality photos.  It also comes with a rechargable battery. One of the greatest features is the wireless remote control which has the zoom feature.  The LCD screen pivots out to allow you to see the picture you are composing (use the remote to zoom in or out) and snap the picture once you have arranged the perfect shot. Now I can be in group shots and vacation pictures.The Canon G2 was about $100.00 more than the camera I originally bought which needed more memory at a cost of $60 and rechargeable batteries at a cost of $40.  So, basically the Canon G2 cost the same thing, but provided much better quality and extras.I read another review which stated the red eye reduction did not work.  This only happens to me when I am taking pictures in a very dark room or outside when there is no light.  If I turn the light on in the room I am taking the picture, I have no problem.  If the picture does have red eye, it is easily eliminated with the software provided.GREAT CAMERA!

The 4 mega-pixel images look great both when viewed on a PC and when printed (I use a Canon S900).  Several of the other reviewers note that this camera takes better photos then their SLR cameras.  Obviously the interchangeable lenses of a SLR give you more creative options, but for basic medium-range pictures I would agree with the other reviewers - the Canon G2 seems to get the job done as well if not better.The battery life is great.  I did find the 32MB memory card to be a bit small for day trips - after a few weeks I ordered a 128MB CompactFlash card from Amazon.com and have never again run out room.One of the main features that distinguishes this camera from cheaper 4 MP cameras is the ability to control depth of field (amount of distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in focus) and the perception of motion (are moving objects blurred or frozen).  If you have no interest in this, you can just use the G2 in fully automatic mode.  If you have any interest in this, the G2 comes with the usual pre-set modes (e.g., Landscape mode - when selected the camera sets the average optimal settings for a landscape and you yourself don't need to know what they are).  If you have a lot of experience with this, the G2 can give you full manual control.  If you're not interested in controlling the aperture and shutter speed than this camera will still take beautiful pictures but this camera might be more (and more expensive) than you need.Anyone thinking about this camera should also look at the Canon G3, which is slightly thinner and has a little bit longer of an optical zoom (4x versus 3x).

But aftermarket batteries and chargers are available, as are aftermarket accessory lenses. I've found good deals in both by hunting around on a web a bit.And the plusses far outweigh the negatives. The swivelling monitor  is one of the best designs I've seen on a digital camera. The IR remote allows me to take photos with the hamera held 6' over my head on a monopod.

The image quality is great! You can buy accessories and extra lenses for it just like those hot shots with expensive film cameras! I have 3 lenses and two filtering lenses(polarizing and UV filter.) One of my extra lenses is a macro lens which really is wonderful. Which brings me to the point that the camera's macro capabilities are wonderful as is! If you don't know what macro means, I can take a picture of those unsightly pores it gets so close. I have taken some wonderful nature photographs with the macro. I love up-close, detailed pics. This camera has a little bit of everything but not too much it is overwhelming. If you want to use it, it is there and if you don't keep it on automatic!

I never even used a regular film camera before I got this camera because I never had the money to get a really good one. Sure I took the occasional pic with my aunt's point and shoot film camera at Christmas, but that wasn't much fun. When I got this camera I just experimented and took soooooooo many pictures. I am really enjoying photography. I guess the reason I never got interested in photography before was the expense of film and then developing, as well as not being sure the pictures were even any good until you got them back from the drug store. With this camera you just look at the shots and if they stink you delete them and take another shot. No wasted film! IF you don't have a printer at home then you can easily take them to Walgreens or upload them to Walmart's site and get prints from your digi pics.

I am sure once we become professional photographers we will have a SLR digital camera but for anyone less than a professional who is actually getting paid for their pictures, this is the best quality at the best price.

Great photography control, more F stops, great range of shutter speed which you won't see in most consumer level digital cameras.

I'm still waiting for an SLR; the prices are heading this way.  In the meantime, I've got this wonderful camera to work with.  I have used entry level digital cameras, and several peer level models from the competition and Canon has nailed it.  The Olympus and Sony models I owned before this one don't even come close.  Everything about this camera is familiar to an experienced photog, but a novice can pick it up and start shooting without a problem.  Canon clearly benefits from the D30 and EOS 1D being in the field and trickles the technology into this camera.  I have had no issues with it, and the external flash system is 2nd to none.  I have to admit to being a Nikon user for years, but the design of the 950-995 was too off the wall for me, and the CP 5000 appears to be hugely inferior to this camera (slower lens, flash system, highlight blocking).  I honestly wanted to be writing this review for a Nikon, but Canon has won me over.  The G2 feels solid in your hands, the controls are where we would expect them to be, the external flash system integrates seamlessly with the overall function of the camera and is such an upgrade that I wouldn't pass up the chance to use it.  The G2 writes quickly to memory and the battery supplies plenty of power for several hundred shots.  White balance issues of some competing brands is non-existent; contrast, saturation and sharpness can all be adjusted in camera.

The review is part of my personal/hobby ....I've been using the G2 fairly intensively for about 2 months. I use it in close combination with my iBook and iPhoto, together with GraphicConverter. I have some amateur photography expertise and a good amount of computing expertise.Overall I am very pleased with my experience, but I can say with certainty (and surprise) that we are still quite early in the digital phtography age. As excellent as this product is, there is vast room for improvement in both the G2 and in digital photography in general. The good news is that even in its current immature state it's worth doing.Pros and Cons follow:Pro: Shutter lag is tolerable if one can get focus lockCon: Focusing. The camera is often very slow to obtain focus lock. This means one presses the #!% shutter button and nothing happens. Manual focus is very clumsy (dismal) and hard to use, so the focus lock problem is serious and sometimes infuriating.Pro:Good optics.Con: Doomed optics. Uninspiring lens assembly design, silly device for attaching lenses and filters.Pro: RAW FormatCon: RAW Format: secret specifications, poor quality OS X versions of proprietary softwarePro: Solid, made in Japan. Relatively large lens allows some available light photography.Con: Big and heavy.Pro: LCD view panelCon: The worst optical viewfinder ever made for any camera.Pro: AC adapter brick not too heavy/bulky.Con: Flimsy cover for camera power/USB connections. AC Adapter clearly has a mismatched plug/cord that tends to fall out.Pro: Programmed settings.Con: Inability to save personalized settings.Pro: Macro featurePro: CF II supportCon: Bundled OS X software is incomplete or of poor quality; Canon refuses to share information with alternative developers. On the other hand the Windows software (installed on Win2K) is even lower quality, with major apps that simply didn't work.Pro: No SLR vibration, so decent photos at slow shutter speeds!Con: Artificial shutter sound is way too loud, even at the quietest setting. Inexplicable! Need an optical cue that a picture was taken as well as a much quieter shutter sound.Pro: Rapid shoot works well (disable flash)Con: Can't use exposure lock feature if display is turned off.Pro: Can use external flash.Con: Flash exposures are often poor. One gets correct exposure only between about 6 and 12 feet away, otherwise pictures with the built-in flash are either under or over exposed.Con: The camera will power down while images are being transferred to a laptop, even when the camera is plugged in. With JPG images I can transfer about 25 before this happens. If you use Canon's software you get a warning dialog from the software, but if you use iPhoto it simply gives an error message and an empty .jpg file is created. Need to disable auto-off during those transfers.Con: Automatic white balance is unreliable in daylight. Fails to recognize overcast light, must set this manually or images will be overly blue.Digital Problems (all contenders, not just the G2)- Shutter lag (time required from squeezing shutter to acquiring image)- Lithium battery has poor performance at low temperature.- CCD is \"slow\", about ISO 50-100. Can \"push\" to higher speeds, but more \"noise\" (unless super cool). Shutter speeds are slow.- Limited dynamic range and color discrimination.- Standards for image metadata and properties of camera are not well standardized and existing standards are not well supported.- Getting color right across output media is so complex people make a good living as consultants doing this.", "Date": "December 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "This is a very sturdy, semi-pro - Excellent Camera.", "Author": "Ranjan Chari \"Ranjan Chari\"", "ReviewID": "RUOZ5VVBX6D1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the kind of camera that is a joy to use and explore.

I have been using my Nikon 35mm SLR for about 35 Years. With my new Canon, I had to get used to looking into a paralex viewfinder, get used to the LCD screen to try and compose my pictures and digesting the two manuals,the software guide and owners manual which took a few 2 hours sittings. It was lucky for me to have a basic understanding of computers and electronics to understand everything in the manuals. However, having said the above, I am very happy with my new Canon Powershot G2. One last thing, every time I go back to the Amazon Canon website, the price keeps getting lower.

The camera functions well, and takes good pictures, but if this is your first camera I would look elsewhere.If you are looking at getting into higher level photography however, this might be a good place to start.  It's digital, so you don't have to pay the high costs of developing, and the point and shoot function actually takes really good pictures, so if you are still learning, but see something you want to take a picture of, you can.This camera presents the best of both worlds.  It is simple to use in the plain point-and-shoot mode, but it also has all the bells and whistles of a traditional 35mm camera.  You can choose your own fstop and aperture, and choose to shoot black and white.There is also a neat function in this camera for panoramics.  It comes with a photostiching program, and the camera has a panoramic mode, where the viewscreen shows pictures side by side as you take them so you can ensure you don't miss any of the panorama.  When you take photos in this mode, the camera also labels the files with tags of \"_a\" \"_b\" etc, after the file number, so that you know they are part of one panoramic shot.All in all, I have been very pleased with this camera, because I like to take beautiful pictures, but am not a pro and can't justify [the price] for my camera.  This camera gives you all the options you want, and with the largest pixel setting, the photograph you take will print out larger than an 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper.***Warning:*** If you plan on taking a lot(more than 50)of the largest size pictures at one time, buy at least one 128 MB memory card.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R1QB8EL4KJJLRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long-time digital camera user, having owned a Kodak DC-265 (which I gave away only recently) and a Sony Mavica CD1000 (which I still use for its excellent 10x optical zoom). Until recently, I also owned a wonderful 35mm Canon EOS Rebel 2000 film camera with grip extender and a Canon Speedlite flash (which works with both the EOS and the Powershot G2 -- one reason I bought the G2!). I'm in love with digital since most of my work ends up on my wildtexas.com website or emailed to family and friends.I own a 1 gigabyte IBM Microdrive (Compact Flash II) and one of my criterion for purchasing a new digicam was that it supported this format, since I have many different Compact Flash media thanks to my years in digital photography and my interest in Pocket PC PDAs. Since this is a 4 megapixel camera, I'd recommend at *least* a 128 MB CompactFlash card or greater.When my G2 arrived in the mail, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover it was such a sturdy little camera -- heavier than I imagined, but stronger as well. One of the things I dislike about my Mavica is it's so big and bulky -- awkward to hold. The G2, in contrast, is smooth, streamlined and solid in a built-to-last kind of way. I took photos with it at an airshow recently, using the ingenious flip-around viewscreen as I shot the camera over my head (due to crowd obstructions). While the camera got heavy in my hand over time, it let me take shots I would never have been able to manage with my Mavica -- and the videos, while not feature-film worthy were perfect for web use and sharing with friends (the sound recorded is particularly good!)One caveat, and this is for all camera owners (both digital and 35mm) -- buy a good camera case to protect your investment! Lowe Pro bags are perfect for folks who spend a lot of time outdoors, like I do, since many of their bags have attached Gore-Tex rain hoods. The G2 fits perfectly in the Lowe Pro D-Res 30 bag I own, with plenty of room to spare for accessories.The battery life is superb. As an example, I went to the airshow with my Mavica CD1000 and my Powershot G2 fully charged. After taking 15 second videos and some stills for about 30 minutes, my Mavica's battery died. I then switched exclusively to shooting with my G2, and it lasted not only for the 4 more hours we were at the airshow, but also through an entire additional day of off-and-on usage; it still had juice in it when I decided it was a good time to start recharging in, in preparation for our next outing. It's a digital photographers and webmaster's dream come true!I highly recommend getting the largest storage card you can afford and shooting all your images in RAW mode. While this makes downloads to your computer take longer, it ensures you have the HIGHEST quality digital images possible, giving you maxiumum opportunities to do things like get big reprints from a pro lab. With my Microdrive and all RAW images, plus video clips, I still never worry about how much memory I have left.Another bonus of the G2 being so solidly built is I have much less worries about my delicate Microdrive getting harmed when in the camera as I used to when the drive lived in my PDA. The Microdrive is well protected in the G2's body, versus being relatively exposed (with just a flimsy plastic cover) when I used it in my PDA. There's even a CF card eject button, thus eliminating the fear of Microdrive owners far and wide about harming their cards when removing them.Fantastic camera for a worthy price!", "Date": "May 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Canon G-2 Outstanding", "Author": "Don Shanks", "ReviewID": "R1LLVG4SOFWLUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had an Oly' 1.3 Mega/pixel two years.

I have been using all manual 35mm cameras since i began doing photography and this camera has convinced me that the future is truly Digital. It does have many limitations as the digital technology still is under development, but you will find nothing but advantages when compared to a top notch 35mm point and shoot film camera, as you have greater creative control over exposure which is hard to find in 35mm film equivalent other than SLR's. I found the more important limitations are shutter lag; manual focus; horrible optical viewfinder (absolutly no viewfinder info at all); noise in low light high ISO settings; limited ISO range (iso 50-iso400) certain restrictions on settings and controls when using programmed settings. The shutter lag, to me, is the most anoying of all, but certainly something that you get used to. I was dissapointed mostly by the manual focus feature since this is actually a \"virtual\" manual focus, and a very poor one at that.However, as to image quality, I find the RAW format to be great! Little noise (specially when using ISO 50) high resolution images and great colors. Since the RAW file is like a digital negative, you can process one raw immage as you like on your computer. All the available preset white balance settings work as colour filters without the hassle.Even though there are the above mentioned limitations, which, again, are expected from a point & shoot camera, this camera is wonderful and a recomended buy (specially for the price it is running for now). For those of you used to 35mm photography, you will miss the superior image quality but you will not miss wondering how your pictures turn out after you shoot a roll (instant review of resulting image is priceless); fighting with the photolabs over ruined negatives or copies; paying hundreds to these labs for developing services. Also, i have found it of great use when doing pictures of people on the street, as I can show the pictures to a reluctant subject who would then be more willing to let me shoot more pictures with this and my other cameras.I will definately move over to a Digital SLR as soon as they become more affordable and the technology improves.

I have yet to snap a photo where the feedback on the display is there before I can lay my eyes on it. Does it need to be faster than that?2. Battery life. I recharge my battery each day, so I have not tested it for endurance. I bought a backup and a 2-battery dc charger. So far, they have not been required. I am running around showing the camera to my friends and co-workers, running the display while they gawk at my first attempts at digital photography. There have been no warnings about low batteries or much of a perceivable dent in the display after carrying around my camera with me all day at work.

I really did not want to deal with that.And the fun stuff is great. When I get home, I spend a little time setting up the downloads to the albums I created for digital prints...The G2 has so many features, I decided to wade into the world of digital rather than try and learn it all at once. It is helping. I find myself asking questions about how to do this or that with a print. I get the book out and now I am applying what I learn while doing it...There are no disappointments where I wish I were working with silver media. The best part is, I can still take digital work and then send it off or take it to a good camera store and have the image transferred to silver for a print if I want...If I really, really want to keep the photo's. I can burn them to CD-ROM and they will keep better than a negative.

Well, the resolution was just not there on this camera. The color looked good, but the resolution was worse than the 3MP camera that I tried (maybe that's why it's so much cheaper). And the other camera was a Sony also, but it was a 3MP, and you can't really compare that one to this one at all. So, I've decided on this one, and I have taken some great shots. I have three kids so it's hard getting them into focus sometimes (I'm using autofocus also), but when I do, the pictures are great. They look better than my old film camera, and the color is excellent. The Canon has so many manual options that I think is just great. I don't know what most of them do right now, but I will find out. And the movie mode is very nice too. You need to buy a bigger compact flash card though, but you need to on all the cameras really if you want to you use the highest resolution.

The battery pack is long-lasting, allowing you to take an endless parade of pictures before needing a recharge (and I have a 256 meg card in mine). The camera has sufficient weight to feel solid but is quite compact. And it's the first digital camera that I've actually had luck with the red-eye reduction feature. The 3X optical zoom is a blessing when you want to zoom in on something and still retain great clarity (digital zoom creates a grainy picture)and I've captured some fascinating pictures with the macro feature that allows you to get in close for detail shots or capturing the small things in the world. The different shooting modes make picture taking nearly fool-proof but the camera is flexible enough to allow you to be \"creative\" if and when you want to be.The movie feature allows you to capture \"mini\" movies of 30 second duration. Though the movie picture is small and grainy (compared to its regular shooting modes), it's a great little feature for capturing those spur-of-the-moment things.Improvements I'd like to see are faster focusing, shorter processing time, and shorter start-up time (program load-up) but these things are minor and can be overcome by simply knowing what to expect as I grow more accustomed to the camera's \"personality.\"Am I happy with the G2?

The layout is extremely intuitive, so much so that my wife, who has never handled a digital camera, was able to access the playback mode and erase ... pictures I'd taken her.  Features I like:  The rotating LCD screen which allows the camera to be used from any position.  Navigating through the many features available is a snap with the rotating mode dial.  Snap mode is like infinity focus, good for those street shots.  The shutter is responsive, and there is no lag between what you see and what you shoot.  I tried this by pointing camera out window and waiting for a car to enter window frame.  When car doing 35-40 mph was fully in narrow window frame, I snapped, and captured exactly what I saw.  You can select either 0, 2 or 10 sec. review mode, depending on how fast you want to shoot.  Pictures are very sharp, color is accurate and it is wildly easy to use. Manual focus capabilities.  Five resolution modes including a RAW format of 2272 x 1704, which equals a 7.5\" x 5.5\" image at 300dpi, the minimum for hi-res, magazine and book reproduction.  (8\" x 10\" image at max res. is 228 dpi without resampling). Software for PC and Mac is effortless and includes Photoshop LE.  Very efficient and no bugs.  A few nitpicks are:  It is a handful.  The charge and USB port door isn't the sturdiest.  The startup music has to go.  Software takes up lots of MBs.

Hauling out the film gear, I suddenly realized - I could use the G2!  I purchased an adaptor - SafeSync - to protect circuits and reduce the voltage of high powered Norman strobes to 6 volts.  Adaptor fits in G2 hotshoe.  It may have seemed a little odd to the CEO when he strolled up to my elaborate lighting setup and I whipped out this little camera, but the shoot was successful and paid for the camera.

For example, taking a picture of a table you are to include in a sell sheet for a brochure, the nameplate was unattractively hard to read. Overall, the G series IMO was very fast like a point-and-shoot.It is not compact enough to fit in an average pocket. The lens cap fit more securely than on the S1 IS.I would highly recommend this camera if high-quality family, outdoor, etc. photos are your ticket, even if the camera does not have RAW mode.

I purchased the G2 and when it arrived today and did not work properly I contacted Canon.  They said they would gladly repair the camera but were unwilling to replace it or guarantee a quick turn around.  With a planned trip to the Carribean next week I'm stuck with a non-refundable plane ticket, a defective camera, and a company who could care less about helping solve a problem caused by their defective product.  It seemed reasonable to me that they correct this problem but a supervisor told me that Canon does not replace defective cameras.  I read another posting about Canon's poor customer service but thought it was just a fluke.  I assure you that is not the case.  Even the best companies have defective products, but I was expecting more from Canon in terms of correcting the problem.  Buyer beware!  PS, I hear Nikon and Minolta are very responsive and customer focused.  I plan to return my camera and purchase anything but a Canon.", "Date": "July 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2ELD16EXYIC28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera - it's got it all...even a battery that lasts forever!

First, Canon G2 ( I think all series camera coming from Canon) is not truly plug & play camera. It requires its own driver & utility software to display and manage pictures. It took me a whole night to get software installed & connect to G2 with a lot of frustration.  It's unique driver and utility program make your camera can only be downloaded or uploaded to your computer not other' computers if you don't carry Canon's utility CD-ROM with you which means you can only share pictures with friend on small LCD screen when traveling around not on their computer unless a computer is equipped with Memory card reader.  Not like Sony's  USB is truely plug & play, in minutes your camera is reay to read & write like a  portable drive, it accepts in every computer, and you simply just do the copy or cut and paste like whatever you would do at your window desktop, and it acts like memory card reader.  Of cause you can move or store any file you want.Second, my own frustrate experience.  I was shocked when I saw the picture, some were taken at 2272x1704 scale and some were taken at 1024x768 scale in slow shutter.  It looks perfect on 2272x1704, but it also looks awful on 1024x768 scale pictures in slow shutter.  Everything in 1024x768 scale pictures looks blurry with low resolution, for example like waterfall.  Actually all moving persons in picture is like ghost, you can't even recognize their face with movement on the picture.  Wait! These pictures were taken from my wedding party! Thanks Canon for its advanced technology to make this nightmare happens!!  Hope it would not happen on yours folks who would ever think to buy this camera.  I then did some investigation on these awful pictures with provided information, the picture shows it was set on landscape mode which is on a dial next to the auto mode.Then I realized if you set your camera to to auto mode then press menu the setting is 2272x1704 which is corrected setting, but then if you switch the dial to lanscap mode or protrait mode and press the menu button, it shows other setting for 1027 x768 which is not corrected setting.  Why it would go for different setting??? I have no idea ( it may be set as default).  You should know how it happens to the picture when your friend mistakenly turns the dial to landscape mode, also thanks Canon its advanced technology  kicking me back to Sony brand.", "Date": "January 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Outstanding, but price is high", "Author": "Matt Mullen", "ReviewID": "R2M39KMR3BSJ67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product. ...", "Date": "January 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "viewer", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3DVRWMJE30F9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as being a viewer only i can say it is handy hardware,and of course it is truethfull as long as canon made before", "Date": "December 31, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.1 megapixel sensor creates 2,272 x 1,704 images for prints at 8 x 10 and beyond\n3x optical (plus 3.6x digital) zoom lens with autofocus\nIncluded 32 MB CompactFlash card holds 24 images at default resolution; camera is Microdrive compatible\nMovie mode captures variable amount of video depending upon memory card size\nUses proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery (included); connects with Macs and PCs via USB port", "Name": "Canon PowerShot G2 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AW9TV924L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00005Q5U5"}}
