The telephoto lens produces great close-up shots. The filters are to be used with the adapter, not the lenses (which take larger filters), so if you don't already have filters to use with the lenses (which I did), you may want to order them, too. At least get a UV or skylight filter for each lens for protection. This kit is a good value and an inexpensive way to get better photos from your small camera.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "Cameron \"Cameron\"", "ReviewID": "R2XPLRXGTRON72", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to extend the capabilities of my Canon Powershot A710IS and have been very happy with it.This kit actually includes three lenses. A macro, a wide angle and a 2x zoom. The macro works by itself as does the 2x telephoto. The wide angle must be attached to the macro to work. The lenses I received were black Zeikos lenses, not grey like the ones in the photo.They appear to be very high quality construction for the price, all blackened metal and glass with thick lens covers. The picture quality seems quite good as well but I'm just getting started at this whole photography bit and don't really know what to look for yet. I've gotten some very good photos with all three of the lenses and I've also gotten some that had strange blurriness which I could not explain. I suspect it's lack of experience and not any technical issues with the lenses.The wide angle wasn't as wide as I thought it would be. I was hoping for something that would close to double the picture field. I'm guessing here but if the subject is about 10 feet away this lens allows you to captures an additional two feet of subject on the edge of the lens (IE 2 feet on left, 2 on right, 2 on top and 2 on bottom etc) which is still significant and quite noticeable. The fisheye effect on straight lines is minimal but noticeable and is to be expected when using a wide angle lens.The tube adapter for the camera is in two sections. The important bit attaches to the camera itself with a kind of quarter turn quick seating. It is about 2.5 inches long with 52mm threads on the non-camera end. The lenses themselves have 58mm threads and a 52-58mm adapter is included as part of the kit.The adapter tube fits the camera snugly but does have a very slight wobble, as someone else noted in a different review. I can confirm that it doesn't appear to affect function at all. It is also quick and easy to remove and attach. I did have to mark the tube with a Sharpy so I could line it up a bit more quickly but that is a very very minor thing.When you attach a lens to the end of the camera adapter, you cannot zoom completely with the A710IS b/c the built-in camera lens hits the add-on lens at about 80% zoom. This is not a problem for most wide-angle and macro photography since you are generally close to the subject. For the 2x zoom lens, however, there is an extender for the adapter which is a short bit of 52mm tube about .75in long and threaded at either end. With the 2x zoom and the adapter extension you must zoom about half way or there is significant vignetting. I haven't found this to be too much of a problem as long as I only use the zoom lens when the subject is sufficiently far away to warrant it.The kit also includes a UV filter, a purplish looking filter and a polarizing filter. They all appear to be of good quality and I don't see any distortions in the pictures I've taken with them. The only one I use regularly is the polarizing filter.Overall I am very satisfied with the value I got with this kit and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. I've been able to get a number of shots that I otherwise would not have gotten and It's been fun learning how to make the best of the new options on my boring point and shoot.If you plan to use this extensively, one thing I would recommend is to get a second camera adapter tube and a second 52-58mm adapter. That way when you want to switch lenses, you only have to worry about the quick release on the camera itself. With just one camera adapter, every time you want to switch lenses you have to unscrew the lens from the adapter which can take a minute, especially if you want to change a filter as well.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lens Pak for Canon Powershot A720", "Author": "A. KEITH \"space man\"", "ReviewID": "R37BBTS7YG1SX4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is a great idea that doesn't quite deliver on its concept.  The lenses are very good but the adapter that fits onto the Canon Powershot does not seat firmly.  So when the lenses are put onto the adapter, they wobble and wiggle around quite a bit.  I have taken quite a few pictures with them and the lack of firm fit does not seem to impair the quality of the images noticably,..at least as far as I can tell. So it is mostly just an annoyance and gives the whole assembly a cheap and somewhat disconcertingly poor-fit feel.  It also causes the whoe setup to rattle whenever you move the camera from one shot to the next.Also the wide angle lens is pretty unsettling if you attempt to use virtually any zooming with the camera.  The lens causes the whole image to get a tunnel look with the sides creaping into the shot.  It works fine at full zoom out (which is normally where you'd be using it...else why would you want a wide angle lens, right?).  But it takes some getting used to.The filters an other accessories are nice.  The filters, in particular, are very handy.  The cleaning kit is cheap and not especially useful since, like most photographers, I already had d lens cleaning kit and the one in this pak is just real minimal and cheap.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cannon", "Author": "Renee", "ReviewID": "R3LFOW90VG2HGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Love Most of the items I recieved with the exception of the colored lenses.

He had a new digital camera, and he had put this particular accessories kit on his \"wish list\" on Amazon.com.  First of all, it was great to be able to go to the site and find something that I knew he really wanted (high priority!).  I ordered it.  His birthday is in January, but I decided to give it to him early, at Christmas time, so that he could use it and enjoy it while taking photos for the holidays.  The look on his face when he opened the package was priceless!  What a big smile!  And it was so easy -- it arrived only a couple of days after I ordered it, intact and ready to give.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000OFJZW0"}}
