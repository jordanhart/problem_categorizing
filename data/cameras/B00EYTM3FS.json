{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Extremely Impressive Performer", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "RWPOS0CHUKDT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you haven't looked into these Fuji \"X\" cameras, they deserve a look before you make your next major camera purchase. This latest release from Fuji, which comes at an extremely reasonable price, is easily an \"outperformer\" when it comes to picture quality and device quality. The images you can take with it will rival those taken by the much more expensive (and physically larger) Nikons and Canons. If that is a claim that is very hard to believe, you should do some online searching for reviews on these Fuji cameras and their lens offerings. The reviews are almost uniformly positive, and my own experience with this X-A1 agrees.This particular version comes with either a dark blue or black textured finish which is very comfortable to hold while at the same time providing a good \"grippy\" surface. (It feels not wholly unlike the back of the earlier version of the Nexus 7 tablet, with a surface that almost does not feel like metal or plastic; you just have to feel it to understand.) The camera is very light, and even with the lens and battery attached, you are only at a fraction of what your typical DSLR will weigh. There is no viewfinder, either optical or electronic, but there is a gorgeous, tilting 3-inch high resolution screen. This is a full APS-C sensor, the same size as most all DSLRs that are not full frame, and, of course, hugely larger than nearly all point and shoots, including the 1-inch models that have recently been released by the various manufacturers. This model is based on the well received Sony 16mp sensor that is found in a number of other cameras (some of the Sony NEX models, at least one Olympus model, and at least one or more Nikon models), and does not make use of Fuji's \"X trans\" sensor that is found on its X-Pro 1. So, although this model is using a far more traditional sensor, the sensor itself has been very well received in the photographic community, and its use in this model is one reason for the very reasonable price. Fuji is also undoubtedly utilizing some very sophisticated processing \"down the pipeline\" from the image sensor to arrive at such excellent photographic quality.The camera is reasonably comfortable to hold, due primarily to its light weight, but because the hand grip is not very deep, it can be a challenge to keep a good grip until you get the knack of it. The camera's fantastic screen that allows you to compose either above, under, or even with eye level (the screen tilts both up and down to facilitate this) is wonderful. Operational performance of the camera is good. Turn on is nearly instantaneous, and there is very little focusing lag (maybe not quite 100% as fast as some of the Sony's, but very, very fast, and I doubt you'd notice much of a difference), and shut down is also fast. Picture playback on the screen is also very fast, with little hesitation or stutter. The exception to this rule is that when the camera goes into power saving \"sleep\" mode, it is quite sluggish to get it woken back up, sometimes in the neighborhood of 2-3 seconds.There is much more I can say about these types of features, but where this camera excels is in photo quality. Even with the kit lens that comes with this Fuji model the photos are sharp, sharp, sharp, with very nice color and saturation. And I mean, REALLY good. My own experience even with this kit lens is that the camera is knocking off images that rival my Nikon D7000. That might be difficult to believe, and I was skeptical myself until I started examining my own images. There is amazing clarity in these shots, and this is even using just the standard jpg format (not even using RAW mode), so it seems that the jpg rendering engine is doing a superb job of processing the shots.But it is the Fuji lenses that are also being identified as some of the best lenses currently on the market (this camera, along with the other Fuji interchangeable lens cameras, uses the Fuji X-Mount system). Even this kit lens is sharp, with virtually no edge distortion or softness, with images that are sharp and straight across the frame. This particular lens is a Fuji \"XC\" model, and starts at a wide 16mm (24mm equivalent) at F/3.5 and goes to 50mm (75mm equivalent). Are you worried that F/3.5 is not wide enough for low light settings? This is one of the places where these Fuji's excel. There is so little noise in shots that you can run up and down the ISO levels and get perfectly acceptable shots all the way up to 3,200 ISO. (I know that is hard to believe, but I've experienced it myself, and you can check other reviews of the camera along these lines).You can purchase the very highly reviewed \"XF\" lenses, but you might find that the kit lens is all you need for now. It is simply an amazing combination of lens quality, camera performance, and jpg rendering engine. And at its price point, which is lower than some of the new \"super\" point and and shoots, it seems like an unbeatable combination.There are a few non-Fuji X-Mount lenses now available, but they tend to be either highly expensive (the Zeiss \"Touit\" lenses) or quite inexpensive (Samyang, Rokinon). For now, unless you have the money to spring for Zeiss, Fuji's own lenses seem by far the better choice, with high image performance and build quality.I will expand this review over time, but for now, what I want to say is that if you are considering a new camera purchase, you really owe it to yourself to look over these Fuji's before you make a decision. They are superlative devices.Plusses++ Superb image quality, with sharp, rich, and undistorted images even from the kit lens++ Low noise high ISO performance that must surely rank as some of the best available today++ Outstanding 3-inch, one million pixel LCD screen with full set of customizable display options++ Lightweight and easy to handle (though grip is too shallow for most people's fullest comfort)++ Excellent build quality (primarily the camera, but the lens is good for a kit model)++ Very nice image color rendition (many of my images remind me of those taken with my favorite Zeiss lenses, and, yes, I understand that may be difficult to believe)++ \"Velvia\" color mode available in \"P\" mode (simulates Fuji Velvia film)++ Large feature set roughly analogous to most DSLRs (S, A, P, M modes, and many other specialized modes)++ Shots per battery exceed specifications in my own daily use (but drops precipitously at the end; keep a backup handy)++ Extremely reasonable price for what you get (it may be all you need, in some cases)++ Great implementation of \"focus peaking\" for manual focusing++ A variety of \"XF\" lenses are available, most reviewed as some of the best lenses on the market++ A 55-200mm \"XC\" lens is available at a very reasonable price++ Built-in WiFi (some will make use of this, others not)++ Full printed manual comes in the box++ Blue body color available, if that is of interest to you (all black is currently the other body color option) - the blue is dark, and not overly \"showy\"Minuses-- Hand grip would be slightly more comfortable if a bit thicker-- Tendency to overexpose, and this is true inside, as well as outside (use the EV setting in \"P\" mode to control for this)-- Focusing issues in low light (the camera won't autofocus at all when it is very, very dark)-- Autofocusing options limited, compared to other cameras in class (center weighted only, selected point only; manual; no multi-point AF)-- Manual focus peaking only available in one color, white-- Fujifilm brand batteries are expensive (true of all \"brand\" batteries)-- Wake up from power save sleep too slow (about 2 - 3 seconds, depending on level of sleep)-- Mechanical power switch not as smooth to rotate as one would prefer-- No viewfinder of any typr (if you want to use a viewfinder, this X-A1 model will not work for you; you'll need one of the other Fuji models)-- No hand strap provided (only a neck strap; a hand strap is, for me, a much more useful device)-- Manual has no index at the end, making it difficult to look up specific features/functions that you are trying to research-- Kit lens has limited macro ability (minimum focusing distance about 30 cm)-- Lens cover may come off a bit too easily-- Charger unit comes with long, heavy a/c cord; this is unnecessarily heavy and not nearly as portable as a built-in flip-switch style of plug found on many charger units-- \"XF\" lenses very expensive (but only in a relative sense; they are often compared in quality and performance to Leica lenses 10 times their price)Two-Month Shooting UpdateAfter returning from France and from three weeks of shooting in Paris with my wife, all I can say again is WOW. Some of the images this little guy knocks out can are nothing short of incredible. I used three lenses (the 16-50mm XC kit lens that comes with the camera, the 55-200mm XF, and the 35mm XF lenses), and I captured images that are simply among the best I've ever gotten over years of shooting with all kinds of cameras. And it's not just the expensive \"XF\" lenses that account for the quality, although both of these XF lenses here are simply superb (and it shows in the images). Many of the shots I took with the kit lens are simply spectacular. Deep, rich, sharp images that, at times, seem to \"pop\" out from the frame (try experimenting with -1.0 EV, and shooting in Velvia color when shooting in \"P\" mode), and I keep asking myself why I've spent so much money on equipment over the years when this $600 camera and lens often runs circles around them. I even dropped my 16-50mm lens on the Passy Viaduct in Paris, bounced it three times off the concrete, leaving two gouges in the plastic casing, and the guy just keep shooting (although there is no guarantee this will always be the result.) Yes, the grip is a bit uncomfortable at times, due to its shallow depth, and there are some peculiarities that take getting used to (Why can't I turn off the screen info data when rotating the control dial? And why isn't there a built-in help menu, such as used by Sony, to give me help with some arcane settings?), but this is all just quibbling. I keep returning back to the images themselves. Simply stunning. Its one of the most exciting and forward-thinking systems I've ever used. Shooting at 3200 ISO with almost no noise? It's true (although sharpness suffers somewhat). Handheld shots in dark interiors? The camera did it for weeks. Shots within museums? Amazing clarity and sharpness. And, if you're willing to switch to manual focusing, the focus peaking feature allows you to get some truly sharp images (and will reveal just how much error can sometimes be present with auto focusing). The XF line of lenses (at least the two I used) are simply incredible, with a superlative build quality that can be clearly discerned (and with prices to match),  but don't rule out the 16-50mm XC kit lens. Some of the best shots I took were from the kit lens. I don't want to exaggerate here, but once I got home and started looking at the photos more carefully on a high resolution computer screen, I was amazed.Some of the Fuji Lenses:The cost reduced Fujifilm XC 50-230mm F4.5-6.7 Camera LensSome of the more expensive, highly reviewed \"XF\" lenses:Fujifilm XF 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 Zoom LensFujifilm XF 14mm F2.8 Lens Wide Angle LensFujifilm XF 27mm F2.8 Compact Prime LensFujifilm XF 18-55mm F2.8-4.0 Lens Zoom LensFujifilm XF 35mm F1.4 LensFujifilm XF 60mm F2.4 Macro LensHighly Recommended for this Camera:OP/TECH USA Cam Strap - QD (Black) - the perfect size for this cameraWasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Fujifilm NP-W126  - almost as good as the Fuji brand battery, and a charger that's betterExpert Shield Screen Protector for: FujiFilm X-M1 - fits perfectly on the X-A1", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low end Fuji delivers high end results", "Author": "E.

I shoot some paid and many volunteer events including weddings, portraits, and general photography.  I do formal lens reviews for fun.First Impressions: Coming from the X-Pro1 this camera feels cheap, but control layout is similar and is easy to switch between the two.  I don't like the all plastic build of lens and camera, but the body still feels sturdy.\u2714: Direct Controls (2 command dials, many direct access buttons, Q menu)\u2714: Image Quality (well proven 16.3 MP sensor used in many cameras)\u2714: Features (ISO Hotshoe, built in flash, delivers most of what an X Pro1 will for image quality)\u2714: Included lens is very good stopped down 1 stop across the range.  This makes it a great general carry lens.\u2714: Wi-Fi features (Geotagging, transfer photos, etc)\u2718: Plastic build (lens is all plastic with plastic mount, body on camera is all plastic, still well built, just cheap materials)\u2718: No touch screen (makes changing camera settings and focus points much easier)\u2718: No option for viewfinder\u2718: No charging over USB like most competitors (but thankfully it still includes AC battery charger unlike most competitors).Tips:1: Press and hold \"Q\" button to max screen brightness (avoids menu diving).2: Press and hold \"Disp/Back\" button to set silent mode.3: Set focus point mode to AF[] (flexible point) which lets you set focus point location and size (helps prevent inadvertently focusing on background)4: Set Auto ISO range to 3200 or 6400, default of 800 is much to low for this high quality sensor.5: Set Image Review if you want to see short preview of image immediately after shot (I prefer to leave disabled so I can immediately shoot again without wasting 1sec or so to get the image to go away).6: Focus Tracking: To activate this mode set to focus tracking AF with Q menu.  Point the center plus where you want to track and hit the Macro button (left directional, looks like a flower).Autofocus:Continuous (don't even use on this camera, stops focusing after half press of shutter making it useless), Single, Tracking are the main modes.  Tracking mode is enabled by setting it first in the menus and then pressing the Macro/Flower button.  This mode is for focus recompose or tracking a subject moving parallel to the subject.  It is basically like flexible point where the point can move to stay with your subject.  It is not for tracking quickly moving subjects.Focus speed is good with the included 16-50mm lens and if you want to make sure you get a shot set the camera to AF-S and just depress the shutter button all the way until it takes the shot.  This minimizes lag between focusing on half press and fully depressing the shutter.  I use flexible point focus the most and you can change the size of the point with the rear command dial and move it around if you first press AF button.Image Quality:This 16.3 MP sensor is used in many cameras and is a very good sensor.  JPEG quality is typical Fuji, which is pretty good even at high ISO.  You don't have all the film simulation modes that the X Pro1 has, but you get standard, velvia, B&W; and the most used ones.  You can also change many JPEG parameters from in the Q menu.Lens Quality:My copy has some issues wide open in the corners at 16mm, and also a bit soft wide open towards 50mm, but this lens will mostly be used stepped down 1 stop, and if you do it is excellent corner to corner at all settings (especially mid range).  One of the best kit lenses I have used, and 16mm wide end to boot.Features:Lots of great features on this camera.  This hotshoe can be used to fire generic flash triggers and also Fuji flashes.  The built in flash can be used as a bounce flash in small rooms.  This requires setting the ISO at 3200 or 6400 only because the flash is pretty weak, but it really gives images the more professional bounce flash look (direct flash gives the deer in headlights look and shadows on the wall behind).Honestly, coming from my X Pro1 I didn't feel like I was missing much except the viewfinder, which I rarely used.  I actually prefer the usability of this camera since everything can be done with one hand.  The X Pro1 had the AF button and some others on the left side which was really annoying.  I also compared this to my Sony NEX 3n and Samsung NX300.  The Samsung has the most features like touch screen and PDAF in the same price class, but the Fuji has a better lens and is better suited for use with manual focus lenses.If you shoot with manual focus lenses (optional of course), I think this Fuji is one of the cheapest and best manual focus cameras (or the NEX 5T), it has excellent focus peaking, lots of manual controls, high resolution screen to see focus, and is a great value.  The 5T would add touch screen and ability to use external viewfinder.A really neat feature is you can download an App for most smart phones that lets you use your Phones GPS to geotag your photos, and you can also transfer photos to your phone or computer.  However, it doesn't let you direct upload to social media sites like some cameras.Bottom Line: This is a camera I thought I wouldn't like at first, but after using it for a week or so it has become one of my favorite mirrorless cameras to date and Fuji has a stellar set of lenses for APS-C cameras.  I think it is more geared towards an enthusiast, but Fuji has made many excellent consumer cameras too so I think they are in a good position to be good for both users.Verdict: A+, value, features, image quality, performance", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera at this price point, with one caveat", "Author": "Strohmian", "ReviewID": "R2LX6DDKESZN9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "# MEET THE NEW FUJI X-A1, A \"MIRRORLESS COMPACT\" CAMERAFuji has built itself a good reputation in the higher end of the currently very active Mirrorless Compact market, by coming up with new sensor designs and producing quality lenses. This camera is a little different though; it's more of a \"value\" product. For example, it doesn't have their famed X-trans sensor, the body feels a bit cheap with no rubbery grip, and the non- touch screen doesn't do all that well in sunlight. I'd say say that most (but not all!) aspects of this camera are good, but not great. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's properly reflected in the price - which it is.# KIT LENS AND X- LENS SYSTEMThe kit lens disappointed me initially, because it looks even cheaper than the body and the slippery zoom ring is a bit hard to move, especially with slightly moist fingers. I came around though when I saw the pictures that it was capable of producing: tack- sharp and beautiful, putting my Panasonic GX7+Kit to shame - a system that costs twice as much! Also this lens starts at an equivalent of 24mm, which is considerably more wide- angle than most standard zooms. I think that many people will probably simply leave the kit lens on and they won't miss a thing.Fuji also offers a 50-230mm telezoom lens lens of similar characteristics as the kit lens (i.e. \"value\" and still fairly compact, they call it the \"XC\" line), and there is an upgrade path with the \"XF\" line lenses. The latter lenses are larger and more expensive, but also more solidly built and with more options such as on- lens button for the stabilizer or an aperture ring. Painfully missing (to me) in the entire line-up is a wideangle pancake prime lens though, something that I really like for hiking. I do know that it's particularly hard to make such a lens for APS-C sensors, but Samsung has done it (for their incompatible system, that is).# APS-C SENSORFuji uses an APS-C sized sensor in this camera (same size as most DSLRs), which has some implications:- First, the format is 3:2, which is more widescreen than the 4:3 used in Point & Shoots and the Micro Four Thirds System. I actually find this an advantage especially for landscape pictures, but YMMV. If you're willing to lose some resolution, you can also pick a 1:1 or 16:9 format (but still no 4:3, oddly).- Another implication of the sensor size is that you get a narrower depth of field. This should be expected and is desirable in my book, but it's also easier to get an out-of-focus picture if one is not careful.- Last but not least, the large sensor size means lower picture noise. Sometimes the camera goes up to ISO 3200 and I don't see noise in the picture! No doubt there's some in- camera processing, but still, I can now take hand- held night shots and they look smooth! Again, this \"kills\" the images that the expensive Panasonic GX7 produces at high ISO.# HANDLING THE CAMERAThere aren't many bells and whistles, and I may be a little old school for liking it that way. The M, A, P and S modes are solid, in fact I was delighted to find that Manual works with auto-ISO! Apparently that's not standard even in DSLRs, but to me it just makes sense that somebody wants to pick shutter and aperture, with the camera then picking ISO up to your set limit. Also, the mode switching and parameter- changing is easy and quick. I find that a little ridiculous to have to mention even, but I own other cameras that take a second switching modes (one even shows a full- screen notice \"You have chosen S mode. This is good for ..blah blah..\") or clutter up the display with annoying colorful bars when you adjust a parameter.# QUESTION MARKSAfter about a month of use, I did find a few things that I found a little bothersome:1) The autofocus is slow and \"hunty\" (for lack of a better word; what I mean is it's overshooting the focus zone to realize it needs to go back, even if you're just taking a second picture with the lens already in perfect focus). It's particularly unsuited for movies, which Fuji seems to know, as you can set a dedicated movie focus mode such as manual. Also, there is an explicit macro mode like on Point & Shoot cameras. By contrast, the autofocus on the Panasonic is so dead-on-instant that you can easily use it for movies and it doesn't hunt at all. That's an unfair comparison I know, but still I think the autofocus is by far the biggest downside of this camera. Firmware update 1.0.1 addresses this, but I have not seen a marked improvement. Yet? All this is less important if you shoot landscapes, of course.2) The flash system is quite finicky. The built-in flash is a bit underpowered to start with, and I get inconsistent results (dark face on one shot, overexposed the next).3) Unfortunate button assignment. There aren't too many buttons on this camera (and none on the lens), so it bothers me a bit that two buttons are used for Macro (should not exist, just give me good autofocus) and White Balance (people who really care shoot RAW).# VERDICTMy \"question marks\" list seems a little long, but it's mostly workable and the only remaining weakness is the mediocre autofocus, which may not even be an issue for many types of photography. On the plus side, we have the stunning picture quality and the very competitive price. Speaking of competition, I don't think there is much else in this category as of December 2013 as it even underprices cheap DSLRs and Sony's NEX3 line.I've come to think of the X-A1 as a \"I love it\" product with half a star dinged for the so-so autofocus, which technically still rounds back up to 5 stars. If you know what you're getting, i.e. a \"value\" camera with jaw- dropping picture quality, everything should fall into place and I predict you'll be very happy with this product.", "Date": "November

I love it for its low light performance and overall outstanding image quality.The accompanying video provides a demonstration of low light performance.  I'll describe the rest below.I'm not going to go into details of what each button and know does as I'm pretty sure other reviews will cover that at length and am certain the information is readily available on line.  However, I will tell you what I really like about them.Exposure compensation - With the exception of Manual Mode (where you pick the shutter speed and aperture setting, one of the two adjustment knobs is always dedicated to exposure compensation.  That is the adjustment I find myself making most often and it's handy to always have it in the same place.Function access (Fn button) - I can easily change it on the fly.  As with many cameras there's a \"Fn\" button that lets you get to a specific (and preselected, usually by some setup menu function) function quickly.  For example, you might assign it to changing the ISO or focus mode.  That's how it works here but there's the added convenience that if you hold it down for three seconds you get the list of possible assignments and you can pick something else without having to go through the setup menus.Quick menu access (Q button) - There's another button that brings 16 of the most common menu choices to the display where they can be quickly and easily changed.  Between this and the Fn button I haven't had any need to \"go to the menus\" in weeks.The articulated display - The ability to angle the LCD display either upwards or downwards makes it easy for me to get shows that would have been difficult or impossible otherwise.  By tilting it up I can get low angle shots properly framed without having to lie (lay?) in the muck.  Same goes for high angle shots when combined with a monopod and the built in self timer.The Nikon Fotodiox Lens Mount Adapter works perfectly with this camera and gives me access to any of my Nikon lenses.  Also, I've been using the Fujifilm EF-20 Shoe Mount Flash and it's working out to be the perfect accessory.  Compact, light, powerful, and engineered to work with this camera.  It sync's at 1/250th of a second and provides lots more light than the built-in flash.  As an aside, if you already have one on hand, the Sunpak RD2000N Nikon Camera Flash works with this camera except you have to work in manual and do some arithmetic along the way.  (Just remember to set \"Silent Mode\" to off.)I've also added an inexpensive, hot shoe mounted view finder.  When used with preset manual focus I can take instantaneous shots which is great for kids at parties.  (I can do the same without the additional finder and I just find it's quicker for me when I use it.  A couple other things I added are a UV filter, take your pick (the Tiffen 58mm UV Protection Filter works just fine) and a Fotodiox 58mm Inner-pinch Lens Cap because the supplied lens cap doesn't hold to the UV filter as well as I would like.One final, perhaps minor, point is that the supplied lens hood fits as well as any I've seen.  It might even encourage people who don't normally use it to take it along.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value yet in a point and shoot digicam with manual override", "Author": "A. Nonnymaus", "ReviewID": "R244TGBCEEU63Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's all about the image quality.  The Fuji X-A1 and 16-50 kit zoom is such a good value I almost feel guilty giving it four stars rather than five.  But it's also the only camera I've ever felt lukewarm enough about for the first week that I nearly boxed it up and returned it several times.  In the end, after a month, we got along just fine.  The quality of the in-camera JPEGs has freed me from the tedious chore of having to tweak every raw file to suit my preferences.  It's very nearly the perfect travel camera for folks who don't want to be burdened by a heavy, bulky and pricey dSLR kit.I wanted something to supplement - not replace - my Nikon V1, which remains my favorite camera for candid snapshots ranging from street photography to snaps of family and friends.  The Nikon V1 is very quick with AF that can match most dSLRs, but lacks the high ISO image quality of an APS sensor camera.  The Fuji X-A1 fills that niche nicely.  The Fuji can't quite match the Nikon V1 for quick AF, shutter response and an uncluttered top panel, but the IQ is superb.  And the Fuji's physical design overall is more sensible than Nikon's earliest efforts in the 1 System (the notoriously poor rear panel controls of the J1 and V1).Basically, Fuji packed all of their image quality into a box that's as inexpensively made as possible without being junk.  The X-A1 and 16-50 kit zoom do feel plasticky, but not cheap or flimsy.  And the quality of the photos makes up the difference.  Not having to re-edit every photo from the raw files makes using the Fuji a real pleasure.==Best features, strengths, pros:==--All the image quality of an APS/DX sensor for the price of a high end tiny sensor P&S; digicam, and less money than most entry level dSLR/kit zoom combos.--Fits in my smallest waist pack, the Lowepro Off Trail.  My aching back and neck really appreciate not lugging my dSLR kit around.--The image quality.  Yes, it's as good as the hype.  After more than a decade with digital this is the first camera I've used that consistently produces top quality JPEGs that don't disappoint.  Fuji has managed to capture the spirit, if not quite the accuracy, of their classic films.  In more than 1,000 photos during the first month I found only a handful that might have been improved working from the raw files in Lightroom, Silkypix or Photo Ninja.Fuji aims to flatter and please with the digital emulations of Provia, Velvia and Astia.  Skin tones look great for folks of every skin color I've photographed the past month.  The overall color balance is very slightly warm compared with the slightly cool bias of my Nikons.The b&w; emulation is reminiscent of Fuji's own Neopan, or virtually grainless films like Kodak's T-Max 100 and Ilford's XP2 Super C-41 process monochrome film.  Don't look for the grit of Tri-X pushed in Rodinal.  Fuji aims for a classic tonal range and conventional contrast.  This is where a computer based raw converter or other supplemental editor comes in, whether you like Lightroom, DxO Filmpack or the Nik suite.--In-camera raw converter.  Along with the overall IQ, the in-camera raw converter greatly reduces any need for computer based raw converters. The camera quickly and easily handles a variety of color and b&w; looks. Unless you need higher bit depth TIFFs to avoid posterizing in heavily saturated blue skies, sunsets or other brilliant colors that may be re-edited in post, the in-camera raw-to-JPEG converter should handle most scenarios.Fuji's in-camera raw converter is so good, and so quick, I wish they'd issue it as a free computer-based option similar to Nikon's ViewNX2, which nicely emulates Nikon's in-camera raw-to-JPEG conversions, but adds the option to convert to TIFF and to try a few additional adjustments, while keeping the software quick and simple.--Very good optics despite the plasticky feeling lens.  It's sharp enough even wide open for most situations throughout the focal range.  Distortion and chromatic aberration are generally well corrected.--Stabilization works very well in the 16-50 kit zoom, comparable to any VR Nikkor I've tried in this price class.  Really helps for folks who'd rather not lug a tripod.--Full manual exposure control available.--Tilt screen is very handy for horizontal/landscape orientation photos.  When used at waist level or lower, it also helps with physically stabilizing the camera to minimize blur from camera shake.--Scrolling through photos on the camera is incredibly quick, much quicker than my Nikon V1.  I only wish Fuji would add the more sensible options of the Ricoh GRD4, which easily enables selecting groups or ranges of photos to be deleted.--Battery life seems okay, but it's hard to be sure.  I've been so enraptured by the in-camera raw conversion options that I tend to get only 100 or so photos per charge.  But I'm burning up a lot of juice chimping and admiring the photos on the rear screen.==Drawbacks, weaknesses, cons:==--The single most infuriating quirk is the dreadful placement of the delete button on the top of the rear control paddle/cursor up key, sharing the same controller with the AF switch.  This is right beneath the thumb rest area - ergonomically a disaster waiting to happen.  What were Fuji thinking?  Delete buttons should always be single purpose, recessed and well away from the normal range of motion of the thumb or forefinger.  So far I haven't inadvertently deleted any important photos, but I'm keeping a copy of an image rescue utility handy.--Laggy, stuttery screen in anything less than bright light.  I'm spoiled by the Nikon V1's rear screen and EVF, which are nearly as good as looking through an optical viewfinder.  The Fuji X-A1 never lets you forget you're looking *at* a view screen, rather than offering a transparent window on the world.  But, to be fair, I grew accustomed to it within a month and find it less annoying than I did the first week.--Some combinations of button presses are non-intuitive, particularly with in-camera raw conversions.  It would be nice to be able to reassign buttons to suit the user's preferences.  Or just copy Ricoh, which generally has the most sensible ergonomics.--At 16mm uncorrected raw photos from the kit zoom show near-fisheye distortion.  There's also some waveform/\"mustache\" distortion along the edges.  Most of this is corrected internally with in-camera JPEGs, and by lens profiles in Lightroom, the supplied raw converter (a variation of Silkypix 3), Photo Ninja and other software.  But even stopped down some edge and corner softness is unavoidable when correcting this much distortion.--With the 16-50 kit zoom the camera feels a bit awkward overall.  I'll probably add a stick-on Flipbac rubber finger grip, which greatly improved the handling of my Nikon V1.  Folks who've used the 27/2.8 pancake prime say it's a better combination, especially for one-handed carry.--Autofocus is adequately quick and responsive in good lighting but will struggle a bit in EV 5 or dimmer light (average household room lighting at night or dimmer).  Face recognition and focus tracking are not quite a match for my Nikon V1.--Focus peaking in manual focus mode is less useful than I'd anticipated, especially for deliberately composed low light photos.  However it works best when combined with the Fn button to quickly lock focus, which the user can then adjust as needed.  I find it handier for selective focusing in crowds than for twilight landscapes.--While full manual exposure control is available it isn't intuitive, and isn't aided by the non-standard controls.  The rear sub-command dial is less intuitive than a front mounted dial, for folks transitioning from a dSLR (or the well designed Ricoh GR, GRD or GX models).  ISO adjustments require a trip through the menus or Q-menu.--So-so flash.  Balanced ambient light/auto flash isn't quite as consistent and satisfying as the Ricoh GRD4 or Nikon V1 with SB-N5 flash.  No completely manual flash.  And despite the height the pop-up flash is still partially blocked by the kit zoom's hood.  But I got the X-A1 for available light so flash won't often be an issue.  And it will work with my Nikon SB-800 flash on or off camera with the SC-29 cord, in non-TTL auto or manual modes.--The shutter release button isn't quite as nice as the Nikon V1.  The first stage takeup requires more effort and it's too easy to follow through to the second stage and trip the shutter.  I'd rather have a lighter first stage takeup spring pressure on the X-A1, which is generally used for prefocusing and locking exposure (unless you choose other options via the menu).--The rear screen is very good but not great.  Resolution is very good but it's not quite as crisp and clear in daylight as Sony's outstanding White Magic screen (also available on the Ricoh GR and GRD4).  However that White Magic screen is probably what contributed to the Ricoh GRD4's high price, and Fuji is aiming the X-A1 to take market share from the teensy sensor and bridge camera market.--The strap lugs look and feel like cheap stamped metal.  I'm not sure I'll be comfortable carrying this one-handed like I do my Nikon V1, via a wrist strap.--The tripod socket probably shouldn't be subjected to very much stress, such as by supporting a long, heavy lens with the camera mounted on a tripod.  And don't crank the tripod mount too tightly.--As with many digital cameras, reds can be hypersaturated, even with global saturation reduced for in-camera JPEGs.  For some photos of brilliant red flowers and fabrics I've had to pull back the red slider a bit in Lightroom.  Fortunately the X-A1 JPEGs hold up well enough to these adjustments.  This gamut problem may be confined to sRGB and not a problem with professional printing.--The included raw conversion software on CD, a version of Silkypix 3, is adequate but feels awkward compared with Lightroom.  Unfortunately Adobe didn't include native support for Fuji RAFs until version 5, so I'll need to either upgrade from LR4 or continue using Adobe's RAF-to-DNG converter.  However, so far I've been very satisfied with the X-A1 JPEGs and don't expect to need to tweak many raw files.  That makes the camera a real pleasure to use.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good for most users!", "Author": "Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"", "ReviewID": "R2PZ92UB9FM2EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fuji X-A1 is a great little camera. It is not too heavy, and not too bulky. Smaller than a dslr, but pretty much all of the features. This seems very much like the Sony NEX's, except a little bigger. The images are crisp and colors are very accurate. I had a bit of problem with the flash, but it wasprobably something I did, as it only happened once. There are a few little annoyances, and I will get to them straight away. My first is that while you get a good image, don't think you willbe making poster sized prints if the the conditions are not ideal. The image size just seems to be so much smaller, and while it doesn't appear to be an issue when viewing, it certainly comes out when printing 11x14 or larger! Use RAW if you want to make really large prints. The outdoor shots in full daylight were acceptable, btw. The flash is also pretty weak, and you really should get a flash for the camera. The lense is basic, and really could have had a little bit more zoom to it, I think that would make a good starting point at this price point. Still, focusing was very fast. Please understand that these are not THAT major, but should all be noted. None of these are deal breakers though. Video is great, however, I found the focusing would sometimes go out if anything came into the frame, even slightly. Plenty of control in the camera for those who want it, and plenty of program modes for those who don't. Burst shots are great, and with a good card, like the Fuji Ultra Performance card, you will snap the 5.6/max with no problem (this is a good card, but I still prefer my Extremepro's). Macro photography with this lens is mediocore at best, and if that is what you want, you will have to look for a better lense. Also,don't plan on keeping the lenscover for very long as it comes off easily, and I have no doubt I will lose it in a month or so.The screen is really nifty. At first I thought it was a completely foolish design, and didn't see the need for its elaborate, origami-like positions....until I started to use it. What a pleasure! This madeit much easier to film my daughters play without disturbing the people around me or blocking their view! Nice job,Fuji. Start up time is IMPRESSIVE! It's fast, almost instant. The only time it hangs up is when it is on and sleeps, then it feels like it takes forever to come back. As for lag, it is really minimal, and  using the burst mode, I don't think you  will miss any action. Unfortunately, when the flash decides not to work, you will get some very bad blurred images. Note that the flash will not work in burst mode....but I wouldn't expect it to. As for battery life, it is fantastic. Video taping and photographing 3 different events that each lasted over an hour (not continuous use, but plenty of on and off and lots of images) plus viewing, and I still have plenty of charge left(75%)! I couldn'tbe happier,especially since I always feel that I have to buy a second battery. Keep in mind this battery is about the size of 6 sugar cubes and 1200mAh, min.  Low light shots are not bad, and have relatively less noise than others, including the NEX (5). This really surprised me, as I wasn't expecting it. Built-in wifi is fun, but I don't know how much I will use it. I will update in a couple of months as I really start to get to know this camera.If you are looking for a not so compact,compactish camera with most features of a DSLR, look no further. The X-A1 delivers what 80% of photographers need (and want). This set up and a nice telephoto lens will do the trick for just about anyone. One last little nitpick, the neck strap is aweful.It is uncomfortable, and they could have/should have done better. Again, this is not a deal breaker. :)This is a great little set up and worth considering.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Makes X-M1 redundant", "Author": "D. Brodsky", "ReviewID": "R2NS1QBHYDW8TY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "X-A1 is an exciting little camera that has one feature that many Fuji X user appreciate - Bayer layout sensor.  Many of us do not like Xtrans sensors for various reasons: from its rendering of greens (mushy greens when you shoot landscapes with trees in the background) which dpreview review finally acknowledged in its XM1 review, to problems with rendering Raw files via Adobe.  There are countless discussions currently happening in various forums from fujirumors to dpreview and others, what's better Xtrans (X100s/XE1/XPro1/XM1) or Bayer (X100/XA1).  Many X100 owners did not upgrade to X100s due to the fact that Fuji switched from normal Bayer layout sensor to Xtrans.The new XE2 (announcement Oct 16, 2013) will again feature Xtrans II sensor (First seen in X100s).For those who are not aware of the problems and deciding between XM1 and XA1, the issue with RAW and Xtrans is that if you use Adobe programs in your workflow to store/edit photos, Adobe has real problem with translating RAW files from Xtrans sensors.  It does a very poor job and the results are bad.  On the other hand, it render RAW files from XA1 beautifully, as these are regular Bayer type sensor files which are easy for Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom.  So the users of Xtrans cameras that like to shoot RAW have been doing workarounds by using various 3d party software to convert from Iridient to Capture1, etc.These workarounds, as far as I am concerned, are pain in the neck for someone like me.  I have been using Adobe Lightroom for years now.  My entire photo collection is catalogued in Lightroom.  I import all photos from every camera I have through Lightroom and then I edit photos in Lightroom, and sometimes use Photoshop or Silverfx if necessary, then upload photos where I need them to go again via Lightroom.  Lightroom does fine for RAW files from all my other cameras.  Why do I need to spend extra time and effort dealing with Xtrans conversion through a 3d program? What a waste.  Some say it is Adobe's problem that they cannot convert and render Xtrans files.  Perhaps it is, but Adobe Lightroom works for me.On the other hand, if all you shoot is Jpegs and Fuji Jpegs are the best, XM1 or XA1 should be fine for you (with exception of problem with landscape greens in XM1).Going to XA1, it is a tiny camera.  So tiny that to hold it comfortable I had to use the thumb grip (which I had already owned from my XE1 days).  This is the thumb grip that I am using with XA1:  Fotodiox Mirrorless Digital Cameras Type A  With the thumb grip it is very comfortable in my hand.The only other issue is a lack of viewfinder of any sort.  Some of use need/got used to viewfinder.  I myself often find myself pressing this camera to my face and then realizing there is no viewfinder for me to look through.  I'd love to have a viewfinder but It is not there.  If you want viewfinder, get XE1 or the upcoming XE2.  But dont forget XE1 focuses slower than XA1.  Also XA1 has face recognition which makes focusing faster (XE1 has no face recognition) if you employ it to shoot photographs of people.  Now the AF will still not be in the league of latest Panasonic/Olympus m43 cameras, but I think it is at this point as good as Sony NEX-7 for example.Ultimately, the picture quality is astounding, this tiny camera gives you a world-class photo, the top of the class for APS-C sensor.

Currently have Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony A7, and Fuji systems.Fuji's jpeg engine and white balance performance is the best in the industry and this camera has the same engine like all other Fuji cameras. It has Sony CMOS sensor in stead of Fuji's own version but in reality you won't see much difference. Sony sensor actually performs better in low light. I had X-E1 for almost 2 years and sold it after I got this one.The body goes about $300 used and there is no other cameras performing better in low light at that price. At ISO 6400 (some argues it is equivalent sensitivity of ISO4000 to 5000 in Canon or Nikon but I haven't verified), images maintain accurate colors, contrast too ISO6400 and noises kept to a degree where you can print out 13 by 19 easily.AF speed is pretty decent and tad faster than X-E1. Fuji format is certainly slower than Olympus or Panasonic but none of these mirrorless formats can match SLR's tracking performance for sports event or kids running around. So general snapshots and landscape purpose, I am perfectly with its AF performance. Again, we are talking about $450 camera with lens bundle.It has enough controls to control apertures, shutter speed, and others without having to go through menus in the screen. Again, among the best at this price range.Others I can think at this price range is1) Olympus E-PL5 (used): Olympus has better AF speed and touch screen but low light performance is 1-2 steps worse than Fuji. Also, Fuji has larger sensors than M4/3 formats so it works well for portraits when used with large aperture primes such as 35mm f1.4.2) Its sibling X-M1: Exact same camera other than the sensor. I don't really care even if it is priced the same. X-A1 is probably $100-$150 cheaper.3) all the Sony NEX formats: lack of good prime lenses and I personally don't like Sony colors that much.Lastly, Fuji has best prime lens lineup. 18mm, 23mm, 27mm, 35mm, and now 56mm.

The 27mm provides a good FL for most situations.If you want to get a telephoto or wide angle, things get pretty expensive.I would like to get a telephoto but the cheapest one from Fujifilm is $399, which is pretty expensive for most non-pros (i.e. those of us who don't get paid to take pictures).  I hope it goes down in price like the 27mm pancake did :) or an alternative is released.Battery life is good for my use.Overall, I really like the camera.  It makes some compromises (no optical viewfinder, plastic body, no X-Trans sensor), but they are reasonable at this price point, and the extra features are available on other cameras in the X lineup (at an extra cost off course).I would give it 4,5 stars for the minor things outlined above, but I round up to 5.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing value on an awesome camera, may still want X-M1", "Author": "Shane O. Laake \"camera nerd\"", "ReviewID": "R2HJJE50AUU1KP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a Fuji X-E2 owner, I quickly fell in love with the Fuji sensor, design philosophy, and lenses.  Ah the lenses ... They became so alluring that I soon wanted to have more than one mounted on a body and ready to go, so thus I started looking for another body.  While I'm still a SLR shooter, I found that I used the EVF on the X-E2 sparingly, so I opened up my options to include smaller bodies like the X-A1, and I'm glad I did.The A1 offers solid ergonomics, albeit adapted for more of a novice audience compared with the X-E2 and X-Pro 1.  That doesn't mean this camera cannot produce excellent results, whether via the manual controls (not quite as easy to access as on the other bodies) or special modes designed to help beginners.  The feel in the hand is solid and exudes quality--only modestly adapted to a lower pricepoint.  This continues with the rather nice screen and included lens (a step above most beginner \"kit\" lenses, though a notch below the 18-55mm OS of the X-E2).A couple things to note:This camera lacks Fuji's X Trans sensor with their proprietary pixel arrangement.  This isn't a bad thing (Nikon, Canon, etc... take great pictures with similar sensors to this), but for someone looking to precisely match the \"look\" of other Fujis, this can be an issue (it's why I ultimately switched to a X-M1).It's not a pocketable camera, even with the tiny 27mm lens.  It can work in a huge pocket, but unless you're a kangaroo, it's a compact camera that will need to go elsewhere.While this focuses much faster than previous generations of mirrorless cameras (and most SLRs in Live View mode), it's nowhere near as fast as a SLR in continuous burst focusing.None of this should deter most of you from buying this.  The above are niche scenarios, and frankly this is an amazing camera.

If you look at a pixel level details you will see that it's much closer to other 16mb sensors, but overall picture is very good and colors are just magical.Now with the bad. Focus is pretty unreliable and in video tends to hunt constantly. Do not buy it if you want to shoot a video of your loved ones walking around, only if they are static or you are filming from afar. But the main one and the reason for one star downgrade is a non existent grip. I am not sure what other reviewers mean when they say the camera is light. It is pretty heavy with the kit lens. Now, there are DSLRs that are much heavier, but they all have anatomically correct grips. There is no grip here, just a heavy, unbalanced brick of a camera. I am not sure what fuji engineers were thinking of, why they could not add an extra inch of grip, it's not like the camera is close to being pocketable.

It's light and compact - half the size of my DSLR Pentax with absolutely no drop off in quality. Apparently this model has a smaller sensor than the Pro models in the X series, but unless you're a pro yourself, you won't be able to tell the difference. I took one picture of my daughter and one of her friends that is absolutely gorgeous.Another thing I like is that the camera will bracket your shots for you automatically, not only by f stop, but also by film style. Very cool, though I have to remember to hold the camera still during this process since it takes a moment to snap three pictures.My nitpicks:No optical viewfinder - being an old-school guy, my preference is to frame the scene through a viewfinder not on the LCD screen, though I must say I haven't had problems seeing the image in the screen yet.Stiff zoom. Twisting the zoom takes a fair amount of energy and hand strength. I'm not sure it will loosen up as time goes on.The Wi-Fi transfer is only available if you're using a Windows box. Mac users (ahem) are out of luck, but my Macbook Air has a card reader so I'm not all that put out about it.Finally a correction:One one review, someone was griping about their photos not remaining on the LCD screen for review after they took one.

I used to have Olympus PEN PM2, Canon T3i and Nikon D5200. Compared to all these cameras, I must say X M1 and X A1 are a joy to use. And Image quality(NOT talking about resolution) of the Fujis is the best among all. Although resolution is lower than D5200, there seems to be good levels of finer details. The X A1 is one of the cheapest APS-C format cameras yet produces some of the best images in it's category. It is the cheapest camera yet produces best images for any camera under $1000, just like X M1 does.The Fuji 16-50 kit lens is sharp! Forget about using legacy Leica, Zeiss etc. lenses. you can get similar sharpness from this kit lens and as a bonus, you don't have to fiddle with focus peaking to focus manually. The only reason to get prime lenses is, if you absolutely have to have faster apertures. I find no problems using kit lens with slower apertures while zoomed in, because the camera is capable of producing excellent details up to ISO 3200. No other brand camera comes close to Fujifilm X-series cameras. Even though X A1 do not have X-trans array, it's high ISOs up to 6400 are very similar to X M1, IMO.Fujifilm's proprietary \"Q\" button is amazing, every camera manufacturer should copy it. You can access every menu setting on one single page, so that you can review the vital settings or change them as needed.Fujifilm's OOC(out of cam) jpegs are the best in business. There's almost no difference between RAW and OOC jpegs. With that being said, I found these settings to deliver best this camera can do.NR: -2 (even at \"0\", NR is way too aggressive and robbing some finer details. I like to keep it at -2).Color: +1 (If shooting in STD film mode)Sharpness: +1DR: I keep it to 100 most times. Few times, I use DR 400, if you feel the need to produce more details in shadows. You could no longer use ISOs lower than 800, if you choose DR 400. If the light is low and you cannot choose ISO below 800, then just choose DR 400.Shadows and highlights: +2Some cons according to me:My X A1 tends to overexpose most shots. I don't know if I have defective piece but I have to set exposure (-2/3) at all times to get \"normal\" exposure. Another issue, to me is that, the jpeg files have aggressive amounts of NR by default and setting the NR to (-2) is not improving anything significantly. IMO, NR is too much that it's robbing some finer details. Unacceptable. IMO, this NR issue is the same with all Fuji X-series cameras.I have owned 2 Fuji X-series cameras (X A1 and X M1) and used another 2 (X-E1 and X 100S). And all these cameras have at least 1 stuck pixel visible at all times at ISOs below 800. Even at ISO 200! These stuck pixels are not visible at ISOs greater than 800. I tried sensor cleaning in camera to rid of the issue but NO luck. With X-trans cameras, the stuck pixels is NOT removed even if I shoot RAW and load files onto LR5 and Photoninja. However, X A1's stuck pixel is removed automatically when I load RAW files on LR5. Fuji needs to incorporate sensor mapping like Sony and Olympus have been doing. Pixel mapping is very simple program that can be included into camera menus. Olympus has been doing it for so many years and I don't see why other companies shouldn't do that.

Lots of times, it is only the larger packages which has any chance of producing great images, also, the optics of the lens in front of the sensor makes a big difference.

The photos just weren't good enough.Where does that leave us with the X-A1?This camera has amazing potential. Great low light performance, great images, nice small solid compact body, great LCD screen, are just some things that come to mind.Yes, they had skimped on a bunch of features which need to be pointed out. Firstly, lack of optical view finder.. well.. the optical view finder of the X10 and X20 were just a joke, the X100s was fantastic (had both optical that was accurate, and also electronic), X100 was ok (optical was good, electronic didn't have enough resolution).So.... do you really need an optical view finder to take your photos? If you are a pro photographer who takes 1000+ shots a sitting, then you will probably want an optical view finder. If you are shooting casual, ie... family, or travel, then.. you may not need an optical viewfinder. Yes, there are several advantages of optical view finders, for example, having the eye next to the eye-piece encourages a stable posture when shooting the shot.Another quirk of the X-A1 it when comes to navigating the photos, for whatever reason, I was having problems zooming in and out of photos. The camera would just stutter and not zoom in or out. This is possibly fixed in future firmware patches.To summarize, this camera is clearly worthy of a 2nd look. If you have a chance, try one out in a store, play around with it! The kit 16-50mm lens feel sturdy, a little stiff, but performs well.

Plus, this camera is much smaller and lighter than the typical DSLR body and lens. The only issue I can see some not liking with this camera is that there is no viewfinder. Personally, with a camera like this (a point and shoot) I don't really use or expect a viewfinder. For me the rear LCD is sufficient. If you are someone who really wants one you will need to opt for the more expensive XPro-1 or the XE1. The bottom line is this: if you want something more serious than a pocket point and shoot camera but you don't want to lug around a DSLR, this is the camera for you without reservation. The pictures are phenomenal and the camera is super easy to use. Even if you decided to buy a DSLR later you will still likely hang onto this for portability and convenience.

It feels very comfortable in my hands.  The LCD is large and bright and the flash recycle times are very quick.  I am particularly impressed by the quality of indoors photos.  This is my first camera of this type, the camera before this was Canon S5-IS, which is also a great camera, but indoor photos and flash recharge time are better on Fuji.There is no viewfinder on Fuji, which might be a concern in bright sun, Canon has an electronic viewfinder which I used many times when taking pictures outdoors.  I was surprised that the lens cap on Fuji did not have a string.  I need to find a solution for this or I know the lens cap would be lost.  UPDATE:  I solved this problem.  I took a small thin nail, held it with pliers over gas stove fire until it turned red and burned with it a nice small hole in the right side of the top surface that you pinch to remove the lens cap (above the letter F of the word Fujifilm that is on the lens cap).  I took a strap off a portable Altec Lansing USB puck speaker and attached it to the hole.  I then threaded the camera's shoulder through the new lense cap star and now it stays attached to the camera.The display on Canon swings out and pivots, on Fuji it only tilts up and down.  I was glad to find out that replacement batteries for this camera are relatively inexpensive.  With Canon, I always have a set of charged AA Eneloops with me, and I would want to keep an extra battery with Fuji.Overall, I am not a  professional photographer, so i will probably never use several of this camera's features.  However, we have a child and take a lot of pictures and movie clips, and this is a great camera that takes great pictures and movies and it fits our family's needs.WARNING: Bad experience with Fuji customer service.  After owning the camera for less than a month, we lost the lens hood that came with the kit.  I was unable to find a replacement online.  There are many 58mm cheap generic lens hoods that screw into the lens but for those there were reviews that reported vignetting (although cameras mentioned are non-Fuji); therefore, I wanted to buy a lens hood that clips onto the outside of the lens as the one that came with the camera.  For whatever reason spare parts for Fuji are not as easily available as ofr other brands.  I had no problem finding original lens hoods for Nikon and Canon, just not for Fuji.  Fujifilm USA website does not list lens hood in the lens accessories section, and, in my opinion, the site is not user friendly: some products did not have explanations of what they were, prices were not listed, no options to buy parts.I called the Fuji Camera Parts department.  The first rep transferred me to another rep who apparently was in a different (non-parts) department and the second rep told me that the first rep should have helped me.  The second rep tried for a while although unsuccessfully to locate the part number for the lens hood.  He contacted other people inside the company, but no one knew what the part number was or when it will be available.  At the end the rep said that he was surprised the part was not in the system because the lens was out for some time.  The bottom line is that if you lose a part, you may have to deal with the frustration of talking to Fuji.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Entry-Level Compact System Camera", "Author": "Poogy", "ReviewID": "R2EAX57J6R7XI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The entry-level mirrorless X-A1 offers very high quality images and loads of features in a smaller, lighter package for a smaller, lighter price than a DSLR.  It will do most, but not all, of what a DSLR will do.  It uses a 16.3 megapixel large APS-C CMOS sensor, and takes amazing pictures in low light without a flash.  I've used it indoors at night, and if there's decent artificial light the pictures are bright and sharp.  It does have a small manual pop-up flash, which is adequate but there's a hot shoe for a more powerful flash as needed, or when using a lens hood.  The shutter response as well as startup time are plenty quick for my needs, although no doubt there are some faster ones out there.  There's no viewfinder, only an articulated  3\" screen.  The screen, however, is bright and viewable from a wide angle, and tilts to allow shooting from many angles, overhead, etc.The body is plastic but feels solid and durable.  The included F3.5-5.6 OIS 16-50mm kit lens, also plastic, is of good quality and reasonably fast for a short-range zoom, but I would have preferred a little more length.  The 55-200mm Fujifilm telephoto needed to integrate with the body is reputedly excellent but costs more than the camera kit.The X-A1 includes Wi-Fi for easy image transfer to a smartphone or PC, and one-touch HD video recording.Among the many excellent cameras on the market, the XA-1's strength is its excellent image quality and low-light performance in a light, small package allowing use of top-quality lenses for those seeking to take truly excellent photographs at a reasonable price.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice mid-range camera", "Author": "Lauren A.", "ReviewID": "R2D5UWE0R55KFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me, this camera was an upgrade.  I am a purse-sized point and shoot user (e.g., Canon Elph, Kodak EasyShare).  However, i'm finding that (1) I don't carry a camera around much anymore due to the improvements in cell phone cameras and (2) the shutter speed of point and shoots is frustrating such that I constantly miss shots waiting for the darn camera to focus and take the picture.  I got the opportunity to try this camera out and I was very impressed with the lightening fast speed and picture quality.  I can't compare with a DSLR because I've never used one, but compared to the relatively cheap cameras I typically use, it is impressively fast.  I think it does really well in low light.  I took some pictures on Halloween night, for example, and they came out really good.  I was surprised/impressed.  I didn't even think my flash went off!  So this does way better tha the cameras I have used in the past in low light settings.  It is also really easy to take video (caution, the video button is easy to hit by mistake) and there are tons of different settings that you can experiment with.  The zoom is really nice and adjusts very easily.  Unlike a poket sized point and shoot, I had to actually read the manual pretty carefully - several times.  This camera isn't as user friendly to a novice, although it's far easier to use than a DSLR (as far as I can tell).  There has been a learning curve though.  I found this camera to be intimidating at first, but after I took a few hours and mixed manual reading with some online videos (all with the camera in hand) I began to feel more confident when using it.I am not a camera guru, so I can't really speak to the special features etc. compared to a truly high end camera.  My understanding is that this is an entry level \"nicer\" camera.  I've honestly never used a DSLR - they scare this novice - and I am not completely clear on the tradeoffs.  What I can speak to is this - if you are a true amateur photographer, like many of us are, but crave better pictures, this is a good pick. I think this camera is a great choice for people who want more than a point and shoot or cellphone camera but who are not really avid photographers such that a DSLR is a wise purchase choice.  This isn't a camera to carry around every day - it's bigger than whet I am used to.  But you can take nice pictures and the shutter speed is great for parents who know that you have precious few seconds to snap a picture where your baby or toddler is cooperating or looking at you.  Also, you can change around lenses.  I don't have other lenses (and I'm not sure why I'd need any) but my understanding is that this camera works with other lenses in the Fujifim X series.  It's also small enough/light enough to take with you on vacation.

I do not have a DSLR or any background in photography.The X-A1 is a few steps above the average point and shoot. The picture quality is great.  The photos have a professional look to them.  The shutter speed is fast and I can take multiple pictures back to back with little delay.I primarily use the auto mode for casual picture taking. It will detect the lighting, faces, and if the subject is in motion, and automatically adjust.  The manual settings/advance filters are easy to toy with if you're looking for more diversity.  I was able to try out a few settings without even using the manual.The camera also has wi-fi which is really easy to set up.  I can easily share my photos with my smartphone by downloading the FujiFilm app.  You then select the photos you want and send them to your phone.

It is so simple to use and it takes great shots.  I began using it around the garden, taking flower photos, etc., just to get the hang of it.  It took some impressive shots that I immediately posted on facebook so that I could bore all of my friends.  LOL.  But, I knew the true test, for me, would be using it taking some action shots.  I've owned cameras in the past, that were difficult to find the right setting for sports or fast moving kids.  The Fuji was no problem!  I used it during a high school football game and got some excellent pics.  The lens allows to zoom in a bit, simply, and is quite helpful.  Anymore, I always plan on photo shopping my pictures later, but I want to get as close of a shot as possible.I admit, I don't know a lot about cameras, but you really don't have to be an expert to use this kind of a camera.  I've read some of the other reviews and mine seems pretty lame compared, but I just wanted to add my two cents worth and express my admiration for this camera.  And, I'll tell you one of the things that impressed me, right out of the box....It came with a memory card!  One of my pet peeves, when you buy a camera, and it doesn't come with a memory card, or a strap, and the battery is discharged.  The Fuji came with a memory card, strap, and the battery was charged.

I already own a Fuji X-E1.  So I thought: This would be a smaller lighter Fuji, with a few less bells and whistles, but with that great Fuji design and picture quality.  This is a pretty good effort.In much of this review I compare certain aspects of the X-A1 to the X-E1.  To some extent this might be unfair because the X-E1 costs about $400 more.  But I still thought this would be useful for some people who wonder what more do I get with the X-E1, or what's missing in the X-A1.  Actually the X-A1 has many features not found on the X-E1...notably the ability to take movies with a dedicated button, the wifi capability and the tilting screen.  But unlike the X-E1, the X-A1 does not have an electronic viewfinder.  You only have the LCD screen to frame your picture.  The ultimate grade I gave the X-A1 camera, had nothing to do with comparisons to X-E1.  Rather it was based on the X-A1 alone.1.  First, while the weight of camera and 16-50mm lens is slightly less than the X-E1 with its kit 18-55mm lens, it is not game changing.  The X-A1 with its kit lens weighs in at 19 oz while the X-E1 weighs 23.9 oz.2.  Instant review is disabled by default.  Thanks to one of the comments posted below, I discovered that there is a menu option to turn it on for .5 or 1.5 seconds if you like.  I like .5 seconds.  Look in the First wrench in menu, and go to the \"Screen Set-Up.\"  You will find the option there.3.  The one thing I found annoying thing is the stiff operation of the 16-50mm kit lens.  It should not be this difficult to zoom a lens.  It makes you focus on your handling of the camera, instead of the picture you are trying to take.4.  At first I thought the metering on the camera was overexposing the pictures.  But that appears to be because the in camera photo rendering does not always show the pictures as they will appear on your computer.  Once loaded into the computer, the images appeared to be properly metered.  Keep in mind that you can always adjust the camera setting with exposure compensation.  I should add that when viewed in the camera, pictures in Velvia appeared to be more saturated than you might expect. But on the computer, they looked good.5.  I found that the X-E1 with its kit lens took a bit more detailed pictures than the X-A1 with its kit lens.  I'm not sure if this is a lens or sensor issue.  The X-A1 has a different sensor than the X-E1.  When viewed in camera, the differences seems more pronounced then on the computer.  Once viewed in the computer, the differences are subtle.  Most people will be very pleased with the image quality of the pictures taken with the X-A1.Since the X-A1 is several hundred dollars less than the XE-1, I expected the build quality too be lower.  It is lower, but other than the stiff zoom, it is not bad at all.I found that the camera's handling was not as nice as on the X-E1.  Because it is a smaller camera, Fuji took out buttons that could be operated with your left hand.  Everything (except for maybe the flash button) operates with the fingers in your right hand.  This works decently enough.  But I found that sometimes, I didn't move my hand fast enough to change the settings before time expired.  For instance in the X-E1 you hit the macro button, raise your finger a little and turn the wheel to adjust the Macro on or off...works great.  But in the X-A1, you hit the macro button, then have to raise your hand a bit to reach one of the the two wheels that change the setting.  Looking at it, you would think the two would operate equally efficiently.  But I found that in practice, in the X-A1 the macro choice would time out before I changed the setting...and I had to start over again. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  In the end you normally get use to the handling characteristics of a camera.The X-A1 has a conventional Bayer color filter, instead of the fairly unique X-Trans design of the X-Pro and X-E1.  Some users have expressed frustration with RAW conversion of the X-Trans design.  Since I'm a JPEG user 99% of the time, this is not an issue for me.The XA-1 camera does not have a viewfinder.  So it relies totally on the LCD screen in the back for framing the picture, setting shooting options and viewing pictures in playback.  While some people cannot fathom buying a camera at this price point that does not have a viewfinder, (electronic or optical), I notice that younger people are quite accepting of just having the LCD screen in the back. That is an item of personal preference, so I did not downgrade the X-A1 for not having some type of viewfinder.One thing I noticed is that once the camera goes into sleep mode, it sometimes (but not always) takes longer than other cameras to wake up after you press the shutter button.  This causes a delay that interferes with taking pictures quickly.As mentioned above, the X-A1 does add some nice features like a dedicated movie button, Wi-Fi capability, Portrait Enhancer, nice tilting LCD screen and others.The more I use this camera, the more I've grown to like it.  Those who saw the earlier version of this review may have noticed that I steadily increased the rating, which is now 5 STARS.A tip for using the Wireless Function.  1. download the Fuji Camera Application for your tablet or phone.  (I use Ipad, and the rest of the instructions are for Ipad or Iphone).  2. Go the Settings in the IPAD and tap Wi-Fi.  3. Now put the X-A1 in PLAYBACK mode, and press the Wi-Fi button on top of the camera.  4. Press \"VIEW AND OBTAIN\" picture.  The X-A1 will now create a WiFi network.  5. Go back to your IPAD and see if the Fuji Wi-Fi appears in the settings under Wi-Fi.  When you see it click on it and you are now connected.  6. Now go to the Fuji Camera Application on your IPAD and press Browse and then Connect.  The pictures in the XA1 will not appear in the Fuji Camera Application.  This is a slow process.  7. Finally,in the Fuji Camera Application select the pictures you wish to import into the Ipad and tap \"Import\".Maybe there is a shorter route to get this to work, but this is the best I could find.  The instruction book was not as helpful on this point as it could be. It makes it seem as though the XA1 will find your existing network.  I could never get it to do that.  Instead what I found was that the XA1 creates its own network, and you have to look for it on you IPAD. It could be that the process is easier on an Android device. Not sure. If anyone has better instructions for the Wi-Fi operation, post it in the Comment section.

But before I could use it, I had to charge the battery.  Once the battery was ready, I attached the kit lens to the camera and the tulip lens hood which is made especially for this camera.  I have an array of lenses for my DSLR (my primary camera) and I've never seen a lens hood included.  I packed the camera into a small bag and headed off to share it with several people.First, I shared it with a fellow soccer parent who was shocked at how light it was.  To him, it felt cheap, but when he saw the quality of the pictures he snapped and its ability to outperform my Canon T3i in low light, he realized it was anything but cheap.  He was very impressed.Next, I took it to a daytime soccer practice and a woman who is still sticking with her SLR.  She picked up the bag and thought there wasn't anything in the bag.  She loved the color of the photos and ability to focus on people.Finally, I took it to art class with me and shared the camera with a gentleman in his 60s who wears glasses.  He doesn't want to learn how to use a DSLR, but uses his 6 year old point and shoot digital to take very well composed pictures (which he sells and people do purchase).  He was floored by the ability of this camera to accurately focus on people in the picture.  When he picked up the camera, he shot directly into the light to photograph a particular view of their shot.  I could tell he was recreating a shot he'd attempted before without success on his camera.  He was shocked by the camera's ability to focus on the interior of the shop with the bright sunlight streaming in.  The other feature of this camera he noticed was the lens and the breadth of the image that the camera lens took in.I took this camera everywhere with me for a week.  I pulled it out at my daughter's birthday.  I took pictures of the moon.  I photographed a wide variety of subjects.  I was constantly amazed by this camera's ability to take pictures in low light settings.  Often my DSLR couldn't compete at all.  I took pictures of the moon in which the leaves framing the moon were clear on this camera, but were very blurry (even in manual setting with as low a shutter speed that wouldn't result in shaking when hand held) on my Canon.  I had already noticed that my Canon struggles to focus when low light is present in the evening.  I tried to use manual focus, but wasn't able to detect with my own eye when the subject was in focus.  This X-A1 is amazing though!  In dark settings where there is almost no light (not even the moon), I do need to use the flash for the subject to be in focus, but it can do it!The flash on the camera is very unique, but it works so well that there is no red-eye in the pictures the camera takes.  Many people might miss the viewfinder, but people with glasses or who are used to smart phones or point and shoot digital cameras that don't have a viewfinder will love this one!  It took me a bit to get used to photographing with the screen, but I could do it.My one and only concern about this camera (as a DSLR gal who regularly switches between different prime lenses) was the plastic lens cap that the kit lens came with.  I contacted someone at Fujifilm and they did confirm that when you purchase additional lenses, they come with a locking cap on the mount.  This would be a concern if you were carrying any additional lenses with this body and kit lens.  The plastic cap simply came off too easily.  So, I'm glad that's not the case.  The only other question I had was how you know when the battery is full.  And the answer is that the light on the charger will turn off.  I always recommend to camera users to carry an extra fully charged battery with you.  You don't want to be caught without one in the middle of an event.So, who will love this camera?+ Smart Phone and iPod users+ People with glasses+ Teens learning photography+ Just about anyoneWhat do I love about this camera?+ It's ability to take low light pictures+ The ability of the camera to format and even add filters to pictures right on the camera.+ The ability of the camera to wirelessly send pictures to a printer or computer.+ The lightness of this camera and ease of carrying it.+ The ability for this camera to make no sound at all when taking a picture.Is this a camera I'd recommend?  Yes.  If you've looked into mirrorless cameras, this is a great choice.  Other lenses are available--expensive, but very high quality and comparable in cost to the zooms for other camera lines.  Not many prime lenses available yet, but I hope Fujifilm will expand these offerings in the future.  If you want a camera with a viewfinder that's just as light, you could look at the fujifilm x-20.  It has a fixed lens, but would be a significant upgrade from a point and shoot, if you're looking for a really light camera.  You might wonder if I will choose this camera now over my DSLR.  The answer is usually not.  I have a 40 mm pancake lens on my Canon that I love.  I prefer to carry several prime lenses instead of a zoom.  And I'm very used to it.  But, when I'm heading out in the evening and I know I'll be in low light situations or when I need a small camera, I'll be picking this one up instead and taking it along!Everyone I showed this camera to has been impressed... and so am I.

In fact, I've reviewed several cameras from the stellar Fuji X-series. This camera, compared to the similarly priced X20 and the much-higher priced X100s is definitely my least favorite. That being said, it's not a bad camera, but for me it lacks some critical components that make it a no-go.The first deal-breaker for me is that even though it's relatively small (compared to a SLR) it's too bulky for my wife to put in her purse. This means that on vacation, or at Disneyland, etc. I have to carry it around my neck on a strap. If I have to lug around a camera, I'll just bring my full-size SLR. It's not that I need my wife to carry my stuff, it's just that this camera isn't a throw-and-go camera, which is one thing that I look for in a non-pro camera.Another thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a viewfinder. A viewfinder isolates all the distractions from your frame and really allows you to focus on what your shooting. I miss that too much to love this camera. Plus, shooting with a camera held out far enough in front of you to see the screen on the back is simply not the best way to shoot a picture. The further your hands are extended, the likelier the shot will suffer from camera shake. Plus it makes it harder to precisely frame your subject.And finally, because the camera body is (almost) entirely plastic, I just don't like the feel of it. It's too light and doesn't sit well in my hands.I'm not going to go too much into the image quality and operations, as it's somewhat similar to the X20, which I wrote a lengthy review to, but I will say that the image quality is good, especially in RAW, and the controls are well-placed and easy to use.All in all, this is a decent camera and will be a nice option for some people I'm sure. Not everyone has the same needs as I do, but if mine seemed to strike a chord with you, I'd suggest taking a peek at the more stylish, more pocketable, and just as powerful X20, (also made by Fuji). It goes for about the same price. BUT, if you see yourself buying more lenses for this AND realize that it still isn't going to match the quality or versatility of an entry-level SLR (nor would the X20, btw), then this might be just what you're looking for.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awkward and Unintuitive", "Author": "J.

I've owned the Nikon D50 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom Nikkor Lens since its release, and despite having purchased a few point-and-click cameras over the past 8 years, I have yet to find anything that can replace it as my go-to camera.My hope in picking up the Fujifilm X-A1 Kit was that I would find something that would at least match the picture quality of my Nikon while being less cumbersome. I also hoped to allow my 7 year old to start getting the feel for a \"real\" camera. Perhaps it's my familiarity with the more traditional feel of the Nikon (i.e. an eyepiece through which to compose the shot, the simple structure of the body, the intuitive feel of zooming in and out), but I found the X-A1 to be very awkward to use.First of all, it has no eyepiece. This means that there is a constant battery drain because you have to use the LCD display to frame your shot. While many people rely on their LCD screens, for those--like me--who prefer the eyepiece, this is going to feel really, really strange. The weight of the lens in proportion to the body certainly doesn't help. The lens is so light that the movement on it feels more like a toy than a real camera. While I'm looking for a camera that's lighter, in using this camera, I felt like I was holding a toy.The camera's flash is another feature which seems more toylike than I would prefer. It has sort of a spring load action that causes it to flip up and slightly away from the body. It looks really flimsy, and even though I haven't personally had an accident with it, I could easily see where forgetting to put it down immediately and then bumping into the slightest thing could lead to a real potential for it snapping right off. Likewise, the closure where the battery and memory card go into the body seems rather cheaply constructed because it does not stay closed unless you manually lock it into place. This doesn't seem like a big deal to have to do, but I've got two small kids, and they can easily cause a distraction (and did) that would cause me to rush in the process of replacing the battery after charging and then not lock it into place, then suffer it falling out the next time I went to use it. There was no permanent damage done, but it's just one of those things that could have been easily engineered better.As to the picture quality, I have to say that I'm not especially impressed, though I do have to add a caveat to my reason. Coming from a 6.1 MP camera to one that boasts 16.3 MP, I expected a difference in picture quality. It may exist for someone who is more skilled with camera settings. But, with my Nikon, I was able to pick it up and use it with a cursory glance through the user's manual. With this Fujifilm X-A1, I've found that even the \"auto\" setting isn't intuitive. In fact, when first using it, I got repeated instructions to refer to the manual in order to set up the auto-setting. What?! I seriously resent that about the camera. I hate reading technical directions, and I can understand the need to read through them to figure out all the bells and whistles, but you shouldn't have to slog through a manual for the auto setting! And, in all honesty, while I'm an avid reader, I'm not a technical reader and the directions just don't always click with me. So I know that I'm not getting the full functionality of the camera, and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay with not getting the full functionality of the auto setting! In the end, the pictures I've taken with this 16.3 MP camera simply don't measure up to what I've taken with my 6.1 MP Nikon. I know a lot of that is the fault of the user (me), but if you're like me and you are just looking for a good camera that can take great pictures, without extensive user knowledge, I'd steer away from this one. While I don't own these newer model Nikons, given my past experience with the brand, the Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Double-Zoom Lens Kit with 18-55mm and 55-200mm DX Zoom Lenses (Black) or Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR NIKKOR Zoom Lens (Black) seem to me to be far better deals.1/21/14 ETA: I've been using this camera for several months now, and if anything, I've grown to like it even less. When it focuses, it takes some awesome pictures. However, it doesn't focus especially well, and more often than not, it causes me to miss the shot. It takes great pictures in low-light settings...when it focuses. But I can almost get better pictures on my camera phone. This camera does not work well in trying to capture my very active children. And the video setting causes me the same problems as the camera setting--it doesn't focus well, so it's easy to record, but the recordings are often out of focus. Apparently, there are those who love this camera, and more power to them. But for this amateur, this camera will never be the one I trust to those precious moments in my family's life.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.95", "Features": "16.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with Hi-Speed EXR Processor II\nTilt able 3-inch LCD (920K-dots high definition)\nPC Autosave Wi-Fi (*6) connectivity to PCs (for easy image backup)\nWireless image transfer to smart phones and tablet PCs via FUJIFILM Camera App\nFull HD video recording at 30fps", "Name": "Fujifilm X-A1 Kit with 16-50mm Lens (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51llyqpPeTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EYTM3FS"}}
