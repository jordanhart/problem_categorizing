{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Most impressive!", "Author": "G. S. Harmon", "ReviewID": "R10BGNBDLREJ95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I'm an old film guy who has resisted digital photography almost as much as dentist visits, I've really avoided making the jump.  Of course, I've had a few small point and shoot cameras for quick snapshots.  But recently, I've found it necessary to get a camera with more capabilities and quality.I'd love to have a higher-end DSLR, but flying these days really doesn't lend itself to lugging a big camera bag with a couple of lenses, flash, etc.  I gripe just taking my shoes off at the security checkpoint.  And I am avoiding paying checked bag fees as much as I possibly can!Last April, I finally decided to get something a bit nicer, and after weeks of searching through review after review, I finally settled on a Fuji HS10.  At first, I loved that camera.  Then, I discovered that particular unit was eating batteries with the voracity of John Pinette at a Vegas buffet.  So, back it went.  And I waited and continued to research.Then, along comes Canon with this G12.  Remember, I'm an old film guy, so I like some controls.  But after 5 minutes playing with this camera, I was most impressed.  Startup - it's ready to go in a flash.  Focus - spot on for 99% of the photos I've shot (nothing's perfect), and that 1% I can peg on me for focus issues.  Low light?  Simply amazing!  This camera's ability to compensate for low light is borderline spooky.  Combined with the lens image stabilization, I've taken shots that would have required a tripod, cable release, and good old-fashioned luck with a film camera.Sports mode is very good.  While the 'rapid-fire' shots aren't blazing fast, they are sharp, clean, and quick to save.  In fact, the camera is fast with saves in most every mode I've tried.  And speaking of modes, I discovered one that I've fallen in love with - Nostalgia mode.  With a quick click of the front-mounted scroll-wheel, one can age a photo making it appear a bit washed out and grainy.  For artistic shots, this mode just made me feel like I was working darkroom magic without the darkroom!Some folks have complained that it's too big for a pocket.  I didn't really have any issues with that.  In fact, I think that for everything this camera can do, it's size is one of the biggest selling points.I just returned from a quick trip to Jamaica where I took all sorts of shots.  The ones that got the most compliments were the low-light shots.  And everyone that asked and showed this camera were amazed at what it was able to do.As I mentioned - I'm incredibly impressed with this camera.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tool for serious photographers - but not perfect.", "Author": "Todd Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R3K1D6BUHF7GCA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I owned a G11 - and for whatever reason sold it a few months back. I have since tried the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1, Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 and Samsung TL500. This whole time I was searching for something better than the G-series - I only found it with the GF1 - but it is too large to be a compact.I only give this camera 4 stars instead of 5 for the following reasons.1. External Speedlite control - you still need a \"Master\" unit like a 580EX II or Canon STE2 to control external Speedlites. Canon should get off their butt in this area to compete with the new Nikon P7000. I almost considered going the Nikon route just to have that feature built in. Canon - start paying attention to what David Hobby says.2. The screen is only 460K resolution. The Nikon mentioned above is 960K. The Samsung TL500 I mentioned above sports a beautiful AMOLED screen that knocks this one out of the park.3. The pathetic optical viewfinder. You are catering to those people that say a camera MUST have one of these - stop it. You are wasting space with something so awful that even a disposable camera does better. I would rather have a higher resolution bigger screen (or a smaller camera) than this awful piece of warped tunnel-vision.4. The rear control wheel is too small - enlarge it so it feels more like one of your DSLRs.5. While the lens is gorgeously sharp (I mean competing with some of my L-lenses sharp) - f/2.8 to f/4.5 is slow.6. The lens needs to be wider - 24mm f/2 (or even f/1.8 in the Samsung) equiv is the primary reason I tried the LX5 and TL500 before going back to Canon.7. No microphone input for video recording.8. Just too big and bulky - slim it down (but do NOT remove the articulating display).So 8 knocks like that might sound like a big deal - but believe me when I say this - the camera is phenomenal.Image quality is outstanding - I have had to process my RAW files with their converter (typically use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 - but even with their converter image quality is second to none in the compact world. I actually prefer to do product shots with a G-Series than my usual 5D2 kit due to the flexibility and increased depth of field. The lens is magnificently sharp. HD video results look pretty good - but not stellar. It'll do in a pinch - but its no camcorder replacement.Operation speed is very very good. I have read a few posts saying that focusing speed is vastly improved from the G11 - I haven't found that to be the case but none-the-less its pretty good.Construction quality is pretty good - but I don't like the rough textured finish as much as the smooth finish on the G11 - it somehow makes it feel cheaper.Controls are absolutely second to none. Dedicated EV and ISO dials are wonderful. The new front control dial is great. The rear dial however could use a bit of an extension - hard to operate quickly with my fat thumb. The whole camera is a little fat - slim it down and kill the awful optical viewfinder. Would like a dedicated movie button like pretty much all of its competitors. The articulating display is fantastic - PLEASE include this whenever you update the 5D.Value for the money is mostly good - but if you are like me and need on-camera control of external flashes add a whopping $200+ for the ST-E2.All in all a fantastic camera - even if it is a minimal update to the G11.Why I picked it over LX5 > See my LX5 review - but I didn't particularly like that camera. Biggest reason would the articulating display followed by the awful screen resolution when composing on the LX5.Why I picked it over the TL500 > I couldn't get the TL500 to trigger external strobes using radio triggers - that plus the lens is MUCH sharper on the Canon. I must have a bad copy of the TL500 as finding a sharp photo in my 50+ test shots is pretty hard.Why I picked it over the S95 > Hotshoe and articulating display. If the S95 had those it would win hands down.Why I picked it over the P7000 > Articulating display is about it here if you don't take into account I already own several Canon Speedlites.Why I picked it over the GF1 or EP1 > Size + Nikon P7000 comments.Hope you found my review helpful - if so please click the link below!Edit 30 days in: I would add one more negative - once you lock focus in video to start recording - that focus cannot be changed after the fact - disappointed in that.Also - I dropped mine this morning =( from 4ft onto concrete. Surprised that everything still works great and as expected it got marred up and one corner's metal is a little bent - but it still works which is impressive.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Canon G12 for advanced photography", "Author": "Moreno Tagliapietra \"fine art photography\"", "ReviewID": "R2H7WOKW07JGOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, I am a part-time fine art photographer and my favorite subjects are landscapes, flowers, classic European architecture, travel, visual arts and crafts. I work with two DSLR systems but like to have with me a compact camera at all times for any eventuality. Depth of field, composition and sharpness are typically more important to me than very fast focusing and shooting (I work mostly in Av mode) but sometimes I need my equipment to be responsive enough to capture travel's fleeting moments.I have recently replaced my award-winning compact Fuji E900 with a Canon G12. Living not far from B&H; in Manhattan, I had the chance to \"play\" with it and the other two cameras I was considering - the Nikon P7000 and the Panasonic LX5 with its external EVF - before buying.  After putting the camera through its paces for a couple of weeks with my kind of photography I have come to the following conclusions.The G12 is an advanced compact camera larger than your average pocketable but smaller than a micro 4/3\" or similar. It does not fit in a shirt pocket but it does it in a regular pouch together with your wallet, cell phone etc. (I never use photo bags to avoid advertising the equipment). The fact that it has some size and weight makes it more stable in my hands and allows for its numerous external controls.The camera's key features include a larger than average 1/1.7\" 10Mp sensor with superior image quality in low light and higher ISO values, a sharp 28-140mm zoom lens, an optical viewfinder, a fully articulated LCD monitor, many dedicated external controls, manual exposure, Raw format, good responsiveness, reasonably fast autofocus even in low light, and a powerful flash.Beginning with the G11, Canon has dared bringing down the resolution of its G series sensors from 14Mp to 10Mp, which is more than enough for most users. This gutsy move has significantly reduced high ISO noise. I can make enlargements around 16x20\" from the G12 with ISO 800 pics in good light and ISO400 in low light (in Raw format and proper processing in Camera Raw).The 5x zoom lens, even if not particularly bright, extends from a very useful 28mm wide angle to a 140mm short telephoto. This conservative zoom range covers most of my typical photography, keeps the lens sharp through every focal length and reduces distortions and aberrations. Some kinds of photography can be done with inexpensive equipment but true wide angle and telephoto work requires high quality, expensive equipment and solid technique (if you are serious about your photography stay away from superzoom cameras). The zoom control is a bit on the sensitive side.Composing with an LCD monitor is sometimes useful but generally awkward and unstable, does not help you concentrate on your subject, and is downright impossible in bright light. The G12 offers an optical viewfinder which, while small and covering only 77% of the image, is often a life saver. When I worked with slide film I strove for a final crop in-camera. Then I moved to digital and learned the creative advantage of shooting wider and doing final cropping in processing. Hence the 77% viewfinder coverage is not an issue for me, I just shoot very tight.The camera has a sharp 2.8\", 461Kp fully articulated LCD monitor hinged on the side (so that it is never in the way of the tripod head). There are specific shooting conditions where a monitor like this is useful.  This includes shooting over people's heads, at ground level and wherever your arms can reach but your head can't. I do macro in the field where this feature is invaluable. A few days ago I photographed the always crowded New York Botanical Garden train show and used the LCD monitor for most of my pictures. With the camera in P mode and forced flash I got many publication-quality pics.I like the camera's external controls a lot, especially the top and front dials. I am less enthused with the back dial which is a little awkward to operate. I have to be careful with my right hand because sometimes I touch the four-way controller, especially the manual focus button. The menu system is more modern and fancier than my Pentax and Olympus cameras but it is a bit slower. The same holds true for the autofocus which is however quite fast and accurate in low light due to the focus assist lamp. In the end, the G12 is overall much faster than the \"mythical\" EVF cameras I owned in the past, including the Olympus C8080 and the Fuji S9100 which took ten seconds or more to write a Raw pic to memory (the G12 does it in two seconds). Continuous shooting is up to 2fps in best possible conditions (jpeg and fixed focus and exposure) and drops to 0.8fps with continuous focus.All the manual controls are there. The camera can shoot Raw and, my favorite, Raw + jpeg. I do all my main work in Raw but having jpegs readily available for the web and for portability is a real treat (you can check or show your jpegs with every computer). The flash is quite powerful reaching 21' at wide angle in P mode.Using the camera in automatic is as simple as it gets but learning its functions serves two purposes: it allows you to get out of trouble if you press the wrong button, and to use all that the camera can offer to the creative photographer. If all you want is a point-and-shoot, there is plenty of smaller, simpler and/or less expensive models out there.The camera offers a cornucopia of operating functions. I particularly value the live histogram before and after shooting, enlarged playback for checking focus, auto exposure bracketing up to +-2 f/stops (for out-of-camera HDR applications), spot autofocus and custom white balance. In jpeg format, I appreciate the Shadow Correct more than the Dynamic Range Correction because it does not crank up the ISO setting (= more noise). I prefer to process my Raw HDR pictures in Photoshop but I am impressed with the effectiveness of the in-camera HDR function (jpeg only). It requires the use of a tripod because the G12 cannot fine-align the three pictures it takes but with this camera you can use the lightest carbon fiber tripod on the market.Macro photography is all right with the usual limitations: the maximum magnification happens at wide angle which puts the front of the lens very close to the subject (= lighting problems). Focus bracketing is limited by the fact that is does not work in macro. It would be a killer macro feature when paired with Photoshop's extended focus function. The G12 has an exhaustive set of accessories including an AC adapter, remote release and a ring flash (there are compatible ring flash units that cost a fraction of the Canon's). The lack of a printed manual is disappointing. I immediately printed my own from the enclosed CD.I almost always work in Av mode with the autofocus set on center spot and locking, and unlocked exposure. With static subjects I like to pick my focus where I want it by pressing the shutter button half way, recompose (with the exposure continuously updating) and take the picture. With the G12 I have to pick the exposure first and lock it with the star button (top right in the back), then half press the shutter button to pick the focus point, recompose again and shoot (it takes much longer to explain it than do it). Please correct me if there is a better way to do this.In jpeg and Quick Shot mode the camera is at its fastest. The LCD monitor turns into an info screen similar to a DSLR camera, autofocus is set to continuous and you compose with the optical viewfinder.The G12 takes movies at 720p at 24fps or lower resolutions at 30fps with stereo sound but without manual controls or optical zoom. I tried and it works as intended (but I use a camcorder for video).As for the competition, the Nikon 7000 is a great camera but independent testing indicates that it is unresponsive and can be frustrating to operate. The Panasonic LX5 is also very good but has no optical viewfinder. I would have to buy and use the external electronic viewfinder which I don't like and makes the whole setup somewhat awkward.In conclusion, I find working with this camera in all the situations that do not require high speed or low light performance to be truly enjoyable. With all the limitations inherent in a compact camera, the G12 is a truly remarkable piece of photographic equipment. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to professional photographers as a go-everywhere camera as well as to serious amateurs who really want to learn the art and don't mind reading the manual.ONE YEAR LATER: after four seasons of not heavy but regular use, I would not replace the G12 with any other comparable camera on the market. There are several points that I would like to make. Shooting coastline landscapes, I have grown a real appreciation for the 16:9 format. With the LCD open to the side and facing down, I am able to lift the camera well over my head and, in specific cases, gain a crucial, higher point of view. While I am a Raw + Photoshop kind of photographer, I am always mystified by the quality of the camera's jpeg HDR function (using a very light tripod). I am also an adult educator and the pictures of my students in the classroom that I take with the flash are really good. The major sacrifice imposed by the size of this camera is the lack of an EVF. The LCD monitor is OK in low light but in the sun you can kiss it goodbye. With all its limitations, it's the optical viewfinder that ends up saving the day.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feast your eyes on an upgraded G series digital camera!", "Author": "Steven Brys \"Koala Lover!\"", "ReviewID": "R2BOLDKNIF6ZDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say I own or have owned a G10, G11, and G12.  I am not really sure why anyone expect the G12 to be a major upgrade to the G11.  The title of this review is the first line of Canon's marketing material on the Canon USA website....so this is what I personally expected, and Canon delivered, as far as I am concerned.  I am not a professional, so my observations are from the viewpoint of an average guy with a serious camera addiction.  I took photos side by side using my G10, G11, and G12 and I have to be honest, I could not tell much difference, though a slight nod would go to the newest camera.  They are all great, however, and suit an average user like me perfectly.  My tests were not scientific and not comprehensive - I have to work for a living after all.  I am very pleased with the image quality, but is it a major upgrade from previous G series cameras, I do not think so.  If I were forced to choose one, I would probably go for the G12 because the photos look slightly nicer to me, and the camera is easier to work with but only if I am forced to choose!Build quality is also as you would come to expect from a Canon high end compact camera that costs $500.  It is excellent just like the G10 and G11.  They all feel and look pretty similar.  There is an extra rubber grip on the back for your thumb which is kind of nice.  Overall, and I have smallish hands, I find the G12 the easiest of these 3 cameras I have been comparing, to hold.Probably the most important new feature is employment of Canon's HS (high sensitivity) system  (combination of sensor and processing engine) which migrates from the EOS line.  Does it deliver on its promise to improve image quality and allow shooting at higher ISO?  I think the answer is yes it does, but not very much.  The camera maxes out at 3200 ISO marked on the dial and you can bump it up to 12,800 albeit at lower resolution using the Low Light mode.  Again, this is how it looks to my not professional rapidly aging, eyes.  Whether it is worth running out an upgrading from a G11 is totally subjective and I cannot answer this for anyone.  The camera also has the Hybrid IS system a la the updated 100mm Canon macro lens which compensates for a greater range of camera shake type.  It looked to me like the camera did a more effective job at obtaining sharper photos at the same speeds as my G11. This is important to me as my hands do shake and I enjoy macro and cannot always use a tripod.  Nor would I expect people buying a carry along point and shoot camera to carry a tripod with them.There are additional new shooting modes like HDR that takes several photos then combines them for greater detail, better exposure.  FYI, this feature was available in Ricoh cameras for sometime already, so Canon and Nikon are just catching up here.  But I think it works a bit better on the Canon than it does in my Ricoh.  The photos do look a bit richer, more detailed to me.  Canon offers a level adjuster with this camera so you can keep your photos looking, well more level.  Another feature that has been available elsewhere for years.There are other niceties about this camera. Like you can pre-set the maximum ISO level (I like because a lot of cameras seem to default to a higher ISO than I would set for myself), there is a front dial to control settings (another inheritance from the EOS line), you can control the dynamic range (just like on Sony cameras from the past) for improved highlight clipping control, and you can shoot in a 1:1 aspect ratio (square which I personally like however, you guessed it, Canon is late to the party on this feature too) to name a few.I will not comment on the video.  I never use it and if I were able to trade video capability for say, a slightly bigger or better sensor, or a faster lens, I would do so in a heartbeat.  But I have no idea if such a thing is even possible or practical.  This is only my opinion and reflects my personal set of priorities.  If it were up to me, I would dispense with most of the shooting scenes and the video if it meant a lower price or a camera with better image quality.I share the findings of many that this is an incremental upgrade of the G11 as Canon's own literature seems to suggest. Higher expectations than this may be met with disappointment.  But in my opinion, the G12 raises the bar, if only a little, of one of the best compact cameras available. I think as long as you keep what the G12 is, (an upgrade) in perspective with what it is not (evolutionary) you will not find yourself regretting your purchase.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a toy, excellent photo quality for a serius photographer", "Author": "Carlos Alberto Poe", "ReviewID": "RHX0V2JQJS7DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to LA last week, from Ecuador for 10 days on vacations, I wished to have this new camera in my hands to feel it, but at Samy's store at Fairfax blvd, they didn't have the camera yet, I ordered one from Amazon, (cost \u00a1$600 plus fast shipping! because it was the only one available at that moment, but...), finally I have it in my hands.first impressions:  small enough, not exactly a point & shoot camera, but not to big too, ideal to bring with you a better equipment than any point & shoot camera any were without to carry a big dslr and a bunch of lenses, actually y have a Canon 5d mkII, a canon 50d and I began the dslr world with the famous Canon 20d, something interesting is that I use all this cameras with a bunch of old Nikkor lenses (at least 20 years old) using an adapter ring, for me it is the perfect marriage, Canon body with old Nikkor lenses, of course I can only use the manual mode and have to use the manual focus ring to get focus but... while my sight is 20/20 love the final results.Some features about this camera:1  The lcd is fantastic, allows to take pictures or movie shoots in practical any position and situation, nice also when you are taking videos or do not want to be noticed when you are shooting, getting more spontaneous photos.2  The ergonomic of the wheels for ISO,compensation and the mode selector are very well located, they work firmly.3  The new front wheel, that works for increase or decrease the aperture or shutter speed is great.4  The menu is easy to use and I like the new formats and sizes you can take pictures, 10:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:2, 4:5 allows to get a better composition and photo formats without crop the image.5  the rugged feel is nice for me, besides is only in two parts of the camera, where your hand and fingers needs more support.6  At first instance I though the optical view finder appears to be so simple and \"awful\" like somebody told before, but, the diopter corrector works fine and when I clean the visor glasses, become so clear and nice that actually I am using it a lot, because do not need to open the lcd screen and it is possible to see the green or orange light which tells you that the exposition is ok or not, \"going back to the old times\".7  I did not test enough the video, but at first look, it is ok and allows to record some interesting moments.8  The quality of the pictures is awesome, really love it, finally can get almost the quality I have with my DSLRs but in a small camera.9  It is fast, is ready to take pictures maybe in a second.10 The quality of the lcd screen may be is not the best, but, allows you to see if the picture is ok, and normally if you see that the picture is ok, when you opened in any software the picture is !really great!11 for me all the wheels are well located, the buttons are in the right place, I have a normal hands size, use xl gloves, but have not fat fingers.12 The autofocus works great, fast and with an excellent accuracy, feature not easy to find in a small camera, so reduces the possibility of loosing a nice photo.12 Could be perfect, but nothing is.This is my first week with this camera, I will let you know more and more of my experience.for now, I am really happy, fits my requirements.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just what I ws looking for", "Author": "Anant Dabholkar", "ReviewID": "R15ZNZ5A7OZYNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this Camera for a few weeks and want to share my findings in this review.I shoot with Canon DSLR's like the 50D and 5D MkII and needed something pocketable with enough manual control plus a lot of electronic wizardy when I didn't have time to set up a shot.This camera fills all those needs.1. Easy to carry in a coat pocket and very light compared to any interchangeable lens camera2. Excellent Image Quality (IQ)at ISO 80, 100 and 200, reasonable upto even 800 for small prints3. Seems quite well built, and has reasonable control through 5 dials (total) on the outside.4. Much more depth of field (DOF)than an APS-C of Full Frame sensor, this helps tremendously for just about everything other than artsy portraits where shallow DOF may be desirable. Great for Macros, Landscape etc. where it is a struggle with larger sensors to get the right DOF.5. Fast startup time, and response to inputs.6. JPegs are very very good compared to the time and effort to process RAW files and get just a little more of anything, at all, as compared to high end DSLR's where the opposite is true.7. 720p HD movies. You can't change focus during recording, but this isn't a movie camera, get a dedicated one if you are really wanting to shoot movies, but in a pinch, this works for landscapes and anything else where you aren't focussing a moving objects and looking for a shallow DOF. Even DSLR's like Sony's A55 etc make compromises in order to get focussing when shooting movies.8. Someone here critized the frame rate/speed of this camera. Well, it is only 1 frame per second slower than a 5D MKII that costs 5 times as much without a lens! I would never use this to shoot sports or birds in flight, no kidding.9. The movable LCD screen is a real plus, lots and lots of uses for this, and flipping it over protects the screen, a big plus.10. F2.8 lens, instead of a faster lens. I would take a better quality F2.8, (still a fast lens, fast enough for Pros) than a much larger F2.0 lens, if it lowers Image Quality in any way. At ISO 100, the portrait detail is almost as good as a DSLR and lens costing atleast twice as much, if not much, much more.11. The Hybrid IS is great, have not had a single Out of Focus shot, even a slow as 1/15th of a second, and I'm old!12. I'm adding a 270EX flash for more range and to save the camers batteries. Very cute pair.13. I'm getting the FA(?) lens filter attachment, so I can use a polarizer filter, and so I can put on a lens cap to protect the filter. This moves in and out with the lens and avoids vignetting, and will be great in protecting the lens with a replaceable filter and keeping the lens free of dust.Very few negatives, since you really should not be comparing this to a DSLR. If you must have a DSLR, get a Canon XS for about the same money, which then has its own limitations.Is this a pro camera? NO. Its a great back up camera for a pro, who wants to travel light and stealthy, and get 80% of the shots.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after 4 weeks of extensive use:Like:1. Very fast response and great handling2. Shot about 8 GB (~600 pics +25 short video clips), and only less than 10 pictures and 1 video were out of focus.3. The Canon FA-DC58B filter adapter held up well,and kept dust away from the lens. Used polarizers effectively with no vignetting.4. The Lowepro 100 AW soft case worked well with the camera + lens adapter, and I was able to keep an 8GB card, spare battery and filter in a small, weather tight unobtrusive package that didn't invite unwanted attention, like a SLR would when travelling and with customs.5. Once I got used to switching modes, flash on-off, video to pictures, low-light mode, all in a jiffy, I was really getting a lot of great shots and videos. I doubt if I would have been able to do all this with my DSLR without an assistant!6. The low light mode with IS is incredible. The noise is easily removed with software like Topaz Denoise, and the end results are good enough for the web and small prints.Dislike:1. Not much, other than keep your fingers away from the flash, and thats user error!All in all, unless I needed the highest quality for landscapes of studio work, this camera does the trick, with a lot less stress!", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great $500 Camera", "Author": "R. Sutton", "ReviewID": "R3SWUSMAESJEKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me comment on the \"One Star\" reviews.  These people need to wake up to reality.  This is the best compact digital camera in this price range.... PERIOD. I have the Canon XTI, the 40D, the 5D Mark II, the G-11 and a $2,500 Panasonic Vid Cam. I'm a retired professional photographer.  What camera do I always have with me?  The G-12.  For anything up to 11x14 prints they all fit the bill nicely.Of course for high end work, it's the 5D Mark II or the Panasonic.  I just tested the G-12 against the Panasonic for video capability.  The Panasonic has two distinct advantages.  Power zoom while shooting and the ability to use an external microphone with wind screen (Dead Cat).  But we are talking apples and pears.  You don't carry a large vid-cam on your belt.I spent a few hours on the Virginia & Truckee Railway out of Carson City, NV.  (Side note-- a great steam train ride)  I shot with the G-12 and the Panasonic Professional AG-HMC40 AVCHD Camcorder with 10.6MP Still and 12x Optical Zoom.  I planned to use the video to create a DVD of the ride. On the finished DVD if is not possible to tell the difference in the video shot with which camera.  However, there is objectionable wind noise with the G-12 when shooting into the wind. But that's a given that any videographer already knows will happen with an unprotected microphone.Five stars for the G-12.  It does a great job for stills and video.  Lots of great usable features.The one star folks need to spend the $$$ if they want a \"does everything any time any where features\" and stop crying.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera (I've never given anything 5 stars)", "Author": "R. Cole \"areohbeeceeohelee\"", "ReviewID": "R11U3DQH2YYDNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I compared the G12 endlessly to other similar cameras, especially Nikon P7000, Canon S95, Lumix LX5.I troubled about the 2.8 vs. 2.0 lens, and the shorter zoom range, and lack of zoom during video.Two things finally swayed me:  1. Confidence in Canon G-line - they've been the most popular compact among pro photographers for a long time.  2. The articulating display.So far, I am happy with my decision.I assume Canon went with the 2.8 because they'd rather clip the aperture than suffer any quality loss. I know they are aware that everything else being equal, we'd all prefer 2.0 over 2.8. I'm guessing they wouldn't have been able to make everything else be equal while pushing the max aperture to 2.0. The quality at 2.8 is excellent.Likewise, I assume they drew the limit zoom-wise to maximize performance in the range that is supported. The quality at 95mm max zoom (35mm equivalent) is excellent.I consider the articulating display a must have feature. I know some people think its gimmicky, but for me it just changes everything about the usability of the camera. I could go on and on, but I'll try and be brief: you can take pictures of the underside of mushrooms on a muddy forest floor without getting muddy; you can take pictures discreetly without holding a camera to your face; you can hold the camera high in the air or around a corner and snap; you can take pictures of yourself...Yes, its bulkier than the S95, but thats a tradeoff that seems worthwhile to me - I have a small lumix if I need to put a camera in my pant pocket with less bulge...Anyway, I just found out the Lumix shoots AVCHD video which Lightroom does not support, so I would have been out in the cold there, since I have a Lightroom-centric workflow.The biggest downside compared to the Lumix is you can't zoom while shooting video on the G12 like you can with the Lumix. - Big bummer if you shoot much video with it. Luckily for me I have an older Canon S5 that zooms whilst video-ing, granted its standard def, but thats not a big deal to me.Another peeve is the on/off push-button is easily pressed and whenever pressed tries to extend the lens. Thus if you carry in a pocket or small bag you run the risk of having it turn on and damage the lens extension mechanism - drives me crazy.Another thing I wish the flash could extend more - you can't take macros very close with popup flash supplementation without the lens blocking the light from the flash.I will say I had fairly low expectations image-quality-wise due to the small sensor of all compacts, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The image quality at ISO 80-100 rivals my Nikon D300 at ISO200, and the image quality at ISO800 is very usable (with noise reduction provided by Lightroom), unlike my Canon S5 that looks atrocious at ISO800.The lens is very sharp with surprisingly little chromatic aberration, most of which is nicely corrected by Lightroom. Likewise, wide angle distortion is nicely corrected by Lightroom.The exposure compensation and ISO dials right on body are a godsend. In my opinion, no camera manufacture has invented a really slick UI yet, and Canon is no exception. But, if you're a manual-ISO-a-holic like me its really cool having that adjustment so handy. Ditto for exposure comp.Other downside: There are three little LEDs forever lit up, that don't really help enough to be able to make adjustments in the dark, but make the camera forever visible.

Over the years I stopped having time for such things, until digital photography raised its head in the '90's and I jumped from one technology to another.  Only recently having rediscovered SLRs by way of the digital models, I've grown more and more disdainful of my various point-and-shoot models which I burned through at about one a year.I played with a friend's G11 recently and was more than a little impressed. The quality of pictures, responsiveness of the camera, balanced with the relatively compact size and breath of features sold me at once.  Reading about the G12 I bought one without even trying it.I was not disappointed. After shooting 200 pictures last week I'm very satisfied. This is a wonderful compromise in size against my Nikon digital SLR. I'm able to hand it off to friends to take a shot and they get great results as well.  The feel is sturdy, the menus and functions very straightforward, and the shots I'm getting are terrific.  Time from being turned off to taking a picture is among the fastest I've dealt with.I know there are some very negative reviews of this camera, but they're apparently from people who are upset that this wasn't more of an update from the G11, and they unfairly ding this model because they want to get a dig in on Cannon.  I don't think you have to go further than reading through their \"complaints\" to understand they can be wholly dismissed.This will be my camera of choice for my trip to Mexico next month.

It's a good camera, and as long as there is plenty of light, it takes dSLR quality photos.  However, it seems anything over ISO 400 is objectionably noisy.  I can usually fix this in Lightroom, but then you lose sharpness, and re-sharpening adds back in noise of its own.  A 100% view on your photos will reveal the noise at these ISO levels.  Although I'm not usually given to pixel-peeping, it rather jumped off the screen at me in Lightroom when I offloaded my first photos from this camera.  The lens is not particularly fast, so I end up having to use higher ISO's to freeze motion and avoid camera-shake in many indoor situations.Before this, I had the G9 which was an awesome camera.  Very low noise, high resolution, it was almost hard to take a bad photo with it, but it ended up getting dust in the lens over time.  If I could have found a G9 that was in good shape and a decent price I probably would have gone that route.I gave it 3 stars because it still gives excellent quality at low ISO's and the articulated screen is really a plus and it's built like a tank.

I took the camera for a spin to a concert this past weekend (Maroon 5) and did not expect to get any good shots. I was shocked with the results.

Steinberg", "ReviewID": "R2LEBSEC09L0MR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A quasi-pocketable digital is my preference and I do not want a DSLR because I still use my film SLR as needed. I'm an advanced hobbyist/sometime semi-pro shooter. I've been using my venerable Canon S50 but it finally croaked because I beat the tar out of it!For the last few years I've been pondering a new camera but nothing has seemed quite right. Almost popped for the G11 but the little voice inside said \"wait...\" but I can wait no more. I went to the PDN show in NYC and finally held the G12 and the S95 and the choice was clear to me. Go big or go home!Some aspects of the G12 are becoming obvious: Quick auto point'n shoots in daylight look absolutely great and I'd defy anyone to tell the diff between this and a pro SLR in many cases. Low light shooting is also impressive using the various modes and it seems like there is always some hidden new feature to discover. There's tons of logic in this camera but it definitely takes getting used to (to be able to switch quickly between some feature-buried modes) like any complicated new toy.I never needed an external exposure lock button or an exposure compensation dial (which seems to me to be a holdover from film SLRs and I never used EC anyway)...I do all that with metering, but suppose some folks like it so OK. More buttons = more opportunity for moisture or dirt contamination. I will learn how to use the servo-tracking effectively someday. I'm slowly learning how to utilize the finer points of the G12 by actually reading the manual and as a result I've gotten some impressive shots I'd never have grabbed with my older digital.The two user-programmable custom settings are growing on me and if you put your favorite \"scene\" mode in place it's more like three customizable settings are there. Like with any computer, the average user probably uses only about 2% of the total logic available so it's good to be able to program, say, \"film\" and \"B&W;\" features into the C1 and C2 settings for quick use. I also like slow shutter with first-curtain flash which I do not need to customize, just dial over to the Tv setting and leave a slow speed on it. By the way, Canon, I've never warmed up to your Av/Tv dial settings: its aperature priority (A) and shutter priority (S). So there.To date I do not see much difference between auto setting shots and the non-adjustable-effect (color) \"film\" mode, which the manual says mimics a film look. Too bad--I loved grainy color-neg emulsions and miss using them. I miss pushing 400 to 1000 and underexposing a tad. I miss using polarizers also, for that matter. I do use my beloved Pentax Super Program every so often but alas, results are so much more predictable digitally. The \"nostalgic\" feature in \"scene\" mode, dialed all the way down, gives you nice, grainy b&w; effects which are not as sharp as shots in the B&W; mode. I like that feature a lot and wish I could get the same effects in color.(I am not much interested in post-production fiddling around with RAW or Photoshop--that is too much like work to me and can burn up hours. I'd rather get it right the first time, or get the exposure as close as possible to \"correct\" when I shoot and do only minor color/contrast corrections later. All the moaning about the video shortcomings are probably accurate but I very rarely shoot video.)I can stick my new Canon G12 in my pouch or sling it around my neck easily. The camera is agreeably light but still has enough heft to steady yourself. Nicely grabbable and so far I haven't hit the wrong buttons.I like and need the optical viewfinder even if there is some lens intrusion at wide settings, but so what, it's not for final composition and only about 75% accurate anyway. I did some nature shots and it was good to be able to use the left eye \"real time\" in tandem with the OV with the right.Wish list: lens-wise, a bit wider and a bit faster, like the S95. I would very much desire grainy, adjustable pushed-film-mimicing effects in color and virtual red filters for B&W;, or some way to adjust the B&W; sharpness up or down.The upshot: this is an expensive camera but for us photo type-A control freaks who need to shoot \"out of the box\", this thing will rise to the occasion and can also teach us a thing or three if our minds are open to it.

So we shopped around and bought the super small cannon SD780 last year which also took 720P video. Guess what, we never were able to take the pictures of our kids while they were playing. the images were always blurry. The still images indoors/outdoors were pretty good though but nowhere comparable to G7. My wife kept complaining that I didn't know how to take pictures. We finally sold that away and bought Sony HX5V, this one had 10x zoom and some very good features. But the pictures just didn't compare to the G7 in auto mode and there was no full manual mode on the SONY. Returned that away and bought another ultra compact. this time it was cannon Sx210IS. This had even longer zoom, 14x. but I still couldn't get the pictures of moving objects and people and they were always blurry or pathetic at best. Still pictures were no issue but no comparison to the G7 again. And I missed the manual mode here too.Tired of Ultra compacts that only look good while tucking them away in pockets/purses, I finally convinced my wife that small compacts are not our forte as we were used to taking nice pictures effortlessly and with some great quality and the only way to go was for a bigger expensive camera. I owned and Olympic IS3-DLX SLR which was a beast, before buying G7 several years ago. So we finally bought the G12 from Amazon, knowing that if we didn't like we can return it like the others.And WOW, what a difference in the picture quality compared to those ultra compacts. I am not a professional nor at best an amateur photographer for that matter, but I do dabble with manual settings and it is so easy with these G series cameras and love their swivel screen. The cameras that I bought earlier before buying G12 are no where near comparison to this one in terms of features or price, but still, for someone who might think that ultra compacts/ultra zooms are the way to go for P&S.; Give this a try and you won't go wrong except for the size. The zoom while taking video is some concern but its OK. the picture quality overtakes everything else.(My review is not a comparison of similar cameras nor a suggestion to buy this camera, there may be better cameras out there.

Let me focus on some aspects not mentioned otherwise.This is Canon's 12th generation of their G-series, refined and tuned in small steps. After the G10 disaster they came to senses and lowered the amount of megapixels in favor of a better image quality and low light performance. Good call, excellent! We also like the front modal wheel added, however in many cases its operation is limited, as if added in the last moment and and not really incorporated into the generic function of the camera.And, at the time of their release (2nd half 2010) only this camera and the Nikon P7000 (which we also have) provide both:a) an optical viewfinder,b) RAW format.Do not listen to people calling the viewfinder \"pathetic\" or using any other such strong negative denotation. This is a bare nonsense. Do not compare the G12 viewfinder to the large and heavy viewfinders in cameras like the 7D or D300. Compare the viewfinder rather to any even most modern end-of-2010 EVF (Electronic Viewfinder).I am an ardent SLR (now DSLR) user, and I find the Optical Viewfinder in both G12 and P7000 adequate and a blessing. Considering the weight, size and price, both are somewhat limited, sure. But they zoom with the lens, and they allow me and my wife to photograph in full sun light. No current LCD display or an EVF comes even close to the image showed by this viewfinder. The time, or even an 'Era of EVF' might be to come, but it is not there yet. People who use darkening glasses, or any sort of glasses which might polarize light, find vast majority of modern cameras unusable in sun light. We tried the expensive Lumix/Leica with their viewfinder. It is dark like looking through a dirty glass or a curtain. Compared to such EVF's the optical viewfinders in G12 or P7000 are superior.Why? Because only an optical viewfinder passes light energy proportional to the ambient light, thus to the light to which our eyes are attuned to. Young people who never used film cameras got accustom to the photography on arms length. Not so people who used film cameras all life long! I virtually always prefer the optical viewfinder, and I place my camera close to my eye for better stability.If you do not want the viewfinder, of course the Canon S95 is a better choice. Same sensor, same RAW format, tiny size, less money.Compared to P7000: shorter lens, but boy, the Nikon is dramatically slow when used in RAW mode. Their new firmware improved this by good 40%, what shows the extend of the blunder which they have committed. Even with this improved speed the G12 outguns the P7000 by almost 3:1 in speed of raw image storage. If you do action, forget the P7000 and take the Canon! Image quality seem comparable in both cameras.When you stay with no more than ISO 800, the G12 produces very nice results, in many cases completely competitive with any older DSLR of 10Mpix resolution. Good news is that even the ISO 1600 noise can be processed to a small size image for web or printing (say 2-3Mbytes effective,) which looks great and serves its purpose. This gives a city or event photographer a greater mobility and allows to operate more inconspicuous. Should you need the larger resolution, neither the G12 nor the P7000 will win any \"low light awards.\" Even the bottom level DSLR's will beat them to a pulp.

After digital came along I've owned 3 Olympus DSLR'S, 1 Nikon point and shoot, i.e., S550, and now the Canon G12.  I must admit that my professional days are long gone and the majority of my photography is either macro of plant, flowers, bugs, etc. and during travel.  I also own a pro-sumer Panasonic video camera as well.  One thing I have always regretted is having to lug heavy bulky camera equipment around.  Owning my first point and shoot camera several years ago, the Nikon S550 really opened my eyes to the utility and convenience of a small well made camera.  After reading about the latest point and shoot options I settled on the Canon G12.  I still can't believe what they pack into such a small piece of kit!The stills and 720i HD video (with stereo sound) that this Canon G12 is remarkable to me.  I read one of the \"1 star\" reviews and totally DO NOT AGREE.  It continually amazes me why consumers denigrate a product when they can read, I assume, what they are buying.  I would much rather own a single camera with minor compromises than decide not to carry a camera (stills or video) and miss a great shot.  One thing I believe is that many consumers are convinced that the large, heavy, and bulky \"pro\" cams have got to be better, if not the best.  Those huge pro lens are totally unnecessary with digital sensors vs. film.  The only reason that those huge lens were necessary was that film required much more light gathering capacity.  That is why the four thirds system was invented.  All the majour companies have done is basically convert their 35mm cameras to digital.It took me a long time to convince myself of the above reality.  The features of my new Canon G12 would serve perfectly almost any average consumer, pro and/or otherwise, unless you're more into \"conspicuous consumption\" than a reasonably priced feature packed camera that you can take virtually anywhere and shoot either great stills and/or videos.  The photo software that comes with the camera is also stellar, as is the plethora of accessories offered. They even offer an underwater enclosure if your into diving.

However, when I went to Best Buy to take some test shots, the S95 is too small for me. I felt like I could drop it at any moment. Also, I took about 10 shots and about 3 of them were blurry. With the same specs, the G12 did not even fail to take a blurry photo. The images were sharp and it felt right in my hands, despite a bit heavier than my A590.

The colors are true and the pictures look very artistic. A lot of people who saw my pictures were surprised at the quality. The extra features such as color swap, fish eyes, and miniature mode are nice and also very easy to use. I took some portraits and my skin looked so smooth.Despite it being a bulky camera, the G12 is the best camera I've ever used. Again and again, I keep on recommending Canon to people who are looking for new cameras. Although the battery life needs improvement and the lens can be a bit faster, the G12 is a beast. Even in very low lightning and the lens about 1cm to the object, this camera manages to produce some unbelievably sharp pictures. It's like I don't even have to do the work!

Still Functions 100%.", "Author": "PJ", "ReviewID": "RKKYB1XSQ27L5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:The G12 slipped from my shoulder and onto a concrete sidewalk.  It bounced once.  The front plastic housing is scratched in two spots next to the flash and threaded lens adaptor ring release button. The detachable threaded lens adaptor ring was heavily scratched and the ring saved the recessed lens faceplate where it says \"Canon Zoom Lens 5X IS...\" from getting scraped and damaging the lens itself.  A corner of the flip-out LCD screen was also scratched.  But, the camera is still working 100%.  This is a testament as to how rugged this camera can be.  Obviously, the higher the drop, the greater the damage.Not that it was a problem with the G11, but, the flip-out LCD screen of the G12 now snaps back into the recessed part of the rear of the camera making for a more secure latching of the screen.The flip-out LCD screen carried over from the G11 is great for awkward angled shots.Automatically preset high ISO image quality exceeds the G11.  I have never needed to use the noise reduction tool in either Canon's Digital Photo Professional or Adobe Photoshop Creative Suites 3.  Also, the 2.5 MP Low Light shooting mode yields better image quality than the G11.Video and especially audio quality has dramatically improved on the G12.  Audio distortion (though not perfect) from capturing rock concerts is a thing of the past.  But, if you are looking for optical zoom, autofocus and Exposure Compensation during video recording, this is not the camera for that.  I have the Canon PowerShot SX130 IS and it has optical zoom and, to my surprise, autofocus.  Yes, autofocus!  So, for around $300 cheaper, the SX130 IS would be the compact camera to buy for video and audio recording at concerts.  Concert venues normally will not allow videography. So, a video camcorder is out of the question.The built-in flash is mostly accurate and is sufficient for it's specified range.  Though rarely used, Flash Exposure Compensation should correct most situations and this includes macro captures.The retractable lens carried over from the G10 is sharp at all focal lengths and apertures.  If it wasn't for this lens, I would have looked elsewhere for a compact camera.The rechargeable Li-ion Battery NB-7L is good for about an hour and 30 minutes of video and still captures in a concert at normal operating temperatures.  It is recommended to buy a CE listed and labeled second battery for a 2 hour concert.  It is also recommended to buy at least one 32GB SDHC Class 10 flash card for a 2 hour concert shoot.I love the external Exposure Compensation dial.  It is there when I need to make quick adjustments.The EOS inspired front dial now makes life easier.  The LCD screen tells you when to use the front and rear dials.  So, no worries there.Finally a padded thumbrest.CONS:Surprisingly, RAW is not available in Auto, Low Light, Fish-eye, Miniature Effect and much of the other special shooting modes.The Exposure Compensation dial can be accidentally moved.  A centre button should have been installed on the dial which would require the pressing of that button before the dial can be rotated.  For your information, Canon is now retrofitting for $100 a similar button for the 5D II and 7D.The black paint on the hot shoe will scratch.  Canon should have installed a silver finished hot shoe like the one on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.An on-the-fly video record button is sorely needed.CONCLUSION:Having owned a Canon PowerShot G10 and G11, the larger than compact G12 is the better camera for the advanced and professional user.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "superb performance so far", "Author": "duanearmix007", "ReviewID": "R2TMJXF6KVI11X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been a month since a bought the Canon PowerShot G12 from Amazon via DHL courier, and so far i am impressed with the performance and features. Let me also commend Amazon and DHL for never failing to deliver the goods in less than the time they promised. note that I already bought lots from this online retailer, and I'm from the Philippines. package came just 3 days, in mint condition..now the product itself, maybe the first thing i love with this camera is that the images and features are very much like a DSLR, only in a small package. I bought this product under the consideration that i need a compact DSLR-like camera, with full manual controls but with little footprint everywhere, it is small enough to be carried with me everyday from home to office to places i love.let me also clear that the video on this thing is very good, and IT CAN ZOOM while shooting, as opposed to most reviews that say it can't.the camera has MONSTER controls, everything literally at your fingertips, everything is easy and logical to setup, from trying to achieve shallow focus to accessing special 'tricks' like miniature effect and nostalgia effects.advanced features that works as promised include ability to lock focus, track moving subjects, very very impressive low-light capabilities where you can set a certain ISO threshold even when in AUTO mode, image stabilization works absolutely perfect even in low light conditions and maximum zoom, a mute mode, as well as the flexibility to add different filters and external flash. the camera can also accept the latest 32GB SD cards, even the SDXC ones.also commendable is the movable lcd, which REALLY helps in hard angles when shooting, like very low shoot or very high subject shooting.to conclude, for those who are looking for a very capable camera that is not as huge and costly as maintaining a DSLR, but compact enough to be able to bring everywhere, this is the right thing for you.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point & Shoot - One of the best", "Author": "William R Midden", "ReviewID": "R3EW4GI7O9HHLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Canon G1. I've sold several photos that I took with that camera, the photo quality was that good. I then upgraded to a G3 but eventually then moved up to the Canon 20D and a nice set of lenses for it. However, I've wanted a good point and shoot for those situations for which the 20D is too large and heavy. However, the G series was no longer as attractive because the newer versions didn't use Raw format. However, Canon finally added this valuable capability to back to the cameras in this series. I don't know which of the previous versions might have had it but at least the G12 does. And not only does it have this capability but it's image quality is absolutely superb. I usually use the P setting with auto ISO and I have not been disappointed with any of the shots that I've taken so far. I've now owned the camera about a month. I still use my 20D for more serious work and it definitely has some advantages over the G12 including shorter shutter lag and focus time. But the 20D is a fantastic stand-in when I don't want to or can't carry the hefty 20D and its stable of lens with me. I highly recommend the G12 to anyone who is serious about photography and wants to take excellent photos.

I have a pretty good sense of how a high quality camera should feel and perform.  I was reluctant to move away from my M4s and take the plunge into digital because the cameras in my price range offer little or no manual control over the shot. And, those that did allow me to control the shot were too bulky to take on my backpacking trips.  I'm glad I waited. The G12 feels and performs like an M4 on steriods.  While it will never replace the my Leicas, I can do all the things I love to do with my shots and if I like, I can just put it on cruise control and shoot away. I could go on-and-on about the features, but most of the other reviewers have covered them very well.  Simply put, if you want to go digital and need the performance of a professional grade camera along with the performance, feel and portability of a legend, look at the G12.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great camera for those who don't want to lug their pro gear everywhere", "Author": "Catherine Rodery \"Cat\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIQQA139JTCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a wedding photographer that normally shoots with 5D Mk II's. I got the G12 to carry with me at all times for personal and business trips. As much as I love the quality of my DSLR, it's extremely heavy to carry around my purse even if I take off the battery grip and only bring one lens. So I picked up the G12 for personal use when I'm not off shooting a gig.I love the quality of the pictures on this camera, and it's extremely good at capturing images without the flash. The built in flash works decently too, and it's a great added bonus to have the hot shoe on there if I want to throw my 580 EX II's on it.The 720p video mode is definitely a great and fun feature of this camera. I usually shoot in RAW mode, but I won't lie, occasionally I switch to the \"miniature mode\" to get a pretend looking tilt shift lens style effect.The menu has been very intuitive and I haven't had any problems finding features without referencing the manual first. The dial controls on the camera are great for always being able to quickly see the mode, iso, exposure, etc. I love the flip and rotate lcd screen, back in 2005 I owned a Canon Powershot Pro1 which also had a flip and rotate LCD that I loved, so great to see they're still doing these in the new cameras too.While it seems nice to have an optical viewfinder, to be honest, I don't actually use it at all.So in summary this is a great camera, packs a lot of features and quality into a very sturdy body.

I can not go into great detail about all of the settings and fancy terminology that others can do  so if that is what you are looking for, you won't find it in this review.I AM an artist, however.  I have spent the last 20 years taking accurate color specific photos which need to have accurate texture as much as possible for posting photos of my art in many different media.When I was younger, I used to devour every inch of every tool that I had.  I would learn it inside out and study it until it became like an extension of my hands.  Unfortunately life has crowded out my time and ability to study things so I am forced to learn things off the cuff and fly by the seat of my pants.This can be a problem, however, when it comes to having a very refined taste in photos with color and accurate texture, but only the time to run a quick set of photos.When my Kodak camera broke, I was very upset.  I had one of the nice Z series of Kodak cameras.  Although low light photos were a nightmare, the color intensity and accuracy always delighted my senses- especially when taken outdoors.The Canon G12 is both a huge step forward and a step back.WHAT I LIKEThe step forward is that in low light, this camera is unbelievable!  I can capture a photo in a pure dark room with a flash that I can not capture with most cameras in good artificial light.There are a ton of settings with the G12.  I can set them any way that I want to and that is really nice- except when I am in a hurry.The auto setting is adequate, but not quite as colorful as I would have hoped.The camera is solid and can stand on its own for self portraits and a timer.The intense color setting does a great job in some instancesThe camera is easy to hold and I have no problems adjusting to itThe back screen flipping around for self portraits is fabulous- I take a ton of those and this is a huge help.The lens is FAST- retracts and goes out really quickly.After not using the camera for a few moments, the lens does retract back again into the camera, but if you press the button lightly that takes photos, it comes out quickly again.WHAT I DON'T LIKEThe camera can be a bit heavy and cumbersome when I am attempting to hold it with one hand out of necessity (when photographing my arm or hand).The color capture of this camera is nice outside but in subdued light- photos look washed out.  I am well acquainted with photo editing and do use it, but it is a bit more challenging with the G12.The neck strap can sometimes get in the way when using one hand for photos- but it is a bit too heavy for a wrist strap- although I would like to have that security in case I drop it like I did my other camera.The manual has to be printed out which annoys me to no end.  For a camera this expensive, you would think they would include a manual.  This makes it really hard to learn how to use this camera.I know that some people feel you need to know photography rather than a manual, but I find that I would like to learn this tool, and am very frustrated without inclusion of a manual.I have not used this camera at all near to its potential.  As a point and shoot camera on auto- it is adequate and for most people would probably be just fine.  For the other features, there is no manual at all, unless you print it out, which takes ink and paper.I do love the camera so far, although the color saturation is not quite what I am used to, I will learn to work with it.  The lovely low light capacity of this camera makes up for it, I guess.I have given this four stars because of the lack of manual mostly and the auto mode not being quite as accurate as I would have hoped.But the G12 is such a nice camera in other ways, it is still close to five stars despite my disappointments.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase", "Author": "PiperSopwith", "ReviewID": "R37IB3C1XXJLXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having used the G3 as a workhorse supplement to my DSLRs I kept holding off on the newer G series cameras.

I'd like a couple of minor tweaks in terms of use, but the shutter response is fast and the exposures are well balanced. It is larger than most compact digital cameras, but the ones I've used are challenged to make prints 20x30 or larger (focus and optical quality being the primary issue). The G3 (at 4 MP) can take very good 16x20s, and 20x30s at lower ISO settings on the G12 are fantastic.One other note - the first camera shipped to me by Amazon was lost/stolen in the mail.

I take mostly travel photos of cities in Europe, and some photos of my family here at home. These are quite restricted purposes compared to many photographic hobbyists. Naturally if you shoot macro, or RAW,  or blow up the image larger than what I have suggested below, or make large prints, or do landscapes a la Ansel Adams, or do sports, or exhibit in museums, or do  careful portraits with  lots of bokeh, or wish to sell your photos, then what I am about to say below is irrelevant to your needs and experiences. I exhibit my photos on my 15 inch Mac Book Pro computer and I don't make prints. I do email photos to people. So far I just shoot in jpeg not RAW. This too is quite a restricted way of approaching photography but it is my way.I have been interested in photography for many decades and always wanted a Leica when I was a teen ager and never could afford one. But I was won over to SLR s by the great through the lens views. I also preferred very compact unobtrusive cameras. I owned many of the Olympus Pen compact film half-frame cameras, then the Pen FT half frame SLR, and then the Olympus OM1. Then film cameras went out of style and I switched to digital. I used first a Nikon 5000 compact  digital camera and when that was stolen, used a Sony W1 point and shoot, and have over 15,000 photos on my computer. Many of these were very satisfying from my point of view.. My goal is to take photos that are interesting as opposed to exhibition quality..I chose the G12  because of my preference for an optical viewfinder, which the Sony W1 also had and which I used a great deal, for moving subjects, that is adults walking in cities, and children playing. This has been a very good decision for me with the G12. I don't mind the 77 percent coverage of the optical viewfinder, I can always crop with iphoto in the Mac .It is also very helpful in direct sunshine, where as a traveler I take most of my photos. I would never buy a camera without it.I have owned the G12 for two months and have been very pleased.However four things surprised me greatly about the G12; to me they were totally unexpected:1.My night time and very low light results with my compact cameras were often unsatisfactory but I  shoot very predominantly in the day and didn't realize that a compact camera could do better in low light. So when I bought the G12 I was not thinking of this and was hugely surprised at how good it is in low light.2. I find that the articulating screen is very valuable for composition, and is also very valuable for unobtrusive and unintrusive photos of people, and now that I have it I would never buy a camera without one. It is hard to use for vertical photos though and here I use the optical viewfinder.3. My reason for buying the G12 was  to get sharper pictures than the Sony W1 in daytime outdoor shots. I was surprised to find that the G12 shots were only somewhat sharper, not dramatically sharper. The W1 is pretty sharp  under bright light.4. I had heard over and over that cameras with much larger sensors will give much sharper images and more detailed  than the G12  This I found to be definitely  the case in the dpreview laboratory tests. However it was not the case in the dcresource field tests. The images from the G12, the Olympus EP1, the Panasonic GF1, the Panasonic Zs7,  the Canon T1 and the Canon 50D, on the dcresource web sites for those cameras, using the photos of the same Chinese restaurant building in San Francisco,  clicked on to get full size, and downloaded to my Mac, are, incredibly, of about equal sharpness and detail. Differences if any are really minimal. This is true even if you use the #1 magnification factor on the Mac, in effect blowing the image up to about 14x 20. Try this procedure and make your own judgments. I chose the restaurant building photo on a sunny day since as I said above, so many of my photos are of urban scenes outdoors in various cities.The G12 is, alas, too large for a shirt pocket, unlike the Sony W1,  but fits fine into a slacks pocket (I don't wear jeans so that is not an issue). I have found an OPTEC Mini neoprene case to be a great protection against bumps but still very compact so the camera can go into a slacks or jacket pocket with the case on it.A few words on some of the settings:I have found it helpful to turn off the camera sound:  it makes the sound of the zoom mechanism and the shutter much less obtrusive. I also turn off the flash as often as possible, for the same reason, being less obtrusive. I am experimenting now with turning off the AF Assist light except in very low light situations,  since it emits a blue light that can be seen on the camera itself and as a brief blue blur on the object being focused on; I am trying to be as unobtrusive as possible and apparently AF works fine in almost all light conditions without the AF Assist light being on.Recently I tried setting  the g12 to the combined setting of vivid color and increased contrast (this is one setting) to make the images a bit more saturated and contrasty, but I found out that it makes the colors fluoresce, which I don't like;  the resulting colors seem to me to be unnatural and plasticky, like those at Disney World.  I find it is better to  increase color saturation and contrast by using the \"enhance\" setting on iPhoto; it is less drastic.The Auto/Auto setting lets the camera go only as high as ISO 1600. The Low Light setting lets the camera go as high as ISO 3200, hence with a higher shutter speed.  I don''t notice much difference in the photos as a result.The Quick Shot setting lessens the shutter lag a bit but the shutter lag is so short anyway that I don't use this setting much.My complaints: the zoom control is pretty crude so it is hard to zoom to get the exact framing I want.I have been looking curiously  at the Olympus XZ1 recently but the sample gallery images on the dpreview web site don't look very sharp to me. Plus it has no optical viewfinder and no articulating screen. If it does turn out to be very sharp, it might be an alternative to the G12 for those who don't want an optical viewfinder and an articulating screen, since the XZ1 zoom lens is very fast throughout its range, and the  XZ1 bulk and weight are less than the G12..I hope this will be of help to those of you, perhaps only a minority, whose interests are similar to mine. I think people have very different photographic styles and so what is fine for one person may not be at all suitable for another. This is obvious from the sharp differences of opinion found in internet postings on cameras.For me, the G12 has been a wonderful camera.Raphael W.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the G12's  Retro Vibe", "Author": "J.

In years past, I've taken film cameras to Europe, but now I'm too old for that.  So I wanted a high-quality digi for travel.  These were my criteria: I wanted a viewfinder.

Get outta here! UPDATE 1-13-2012", "Author": "Coug Moog \"s_gil\"", "ReviewID": "RIGYHZ13S0TK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon really goes all-out to give you a one-gadget solution for most shots with their g-series cameras. What I'd really like to see is this exact camera but with the APS-C sensor found on the Sony compact interchangeable lens cameras.Combine an APS-C sensor with the feature set found here, which already produces some achingly beautiful images, and you would have a camera more pros would carry in the field. The main reason they don't already is because Canon's P&S; image sensor is so tiny that low light noise will always be a problem. Miniaturization has now progressed to the point where Sony can offer a smaller camera body with a crop sensor like Canon's Rebel series. But if you've used the Sonys, you already know that even with the big sensor and interchangeable lenses, the G12 still takes better pics.Can you imagine this camera, DIGIC V, its same current feature set and lens optimized for a new crop sensor with 14 MP, each 5 times the size of the pixels in this current beast? Come on, Canon, step up and give us a revolutionary G!For now this baby has some great features that are improvements over my old G10. The new 10MP sensor is a tangible improvement compared to the overpixillated 14MP marketing ploy that beset the old machine. Video is better, everything happens a bit faster. Smaller files write quicker. The articulated display is a major step forward. HDR mode is largely a gimmick--you can get a pretty good 3 shot \"Canon bracket\" with the G12 in RAW that processes nicely in Photomatix for a much smoother HDR experience than you can get in any onboard processing. And with the dedicated exposure compensation thumbwheel and a tripod, you can take your own bracket on top of what the camera does automatically, and get as many shots in your composite as you feel you need.For regular daylight shooting, the built-in ND filter is perhaps my favorite feature of this camera. To my knowledge no other P&S; has it. It gives you several stops worth of ND filtering, allowing you to push your histogram much farther to the right in bright conditions, catching much more foreground detail without burning out the highlights. I use the Lensmate trumpet adapter for a graduated filter to enhance this feature even more. I carried them over from the G10 and they work perfectly with the G12 as well. You can get astounding daylight shots with this camera with just a neutral graduated filter and its own lens features.I keep the adapter and filters in my car--most of the time they are easily gettable when the light gets good as long as I didn't forget to bring the camera! I love this thing for my kind of picture taking. It's not as good for sports and action photography. It's awesome for product shots, landscape, architecture (usable wide angle) and makes far better indoor shots than the old G10. Also takes quite good group portraits in a pinch. But if I know the family's all going to be together, then I lug out the T2i with the 50mm 1.4 prime. I'd rather have a full frame setup with the 1.2 L 50mm for less of a telephoto effect and better performance, but what I have gets wide enough.If I need a wider angle lens, I just pull out the G12. In daylight conditions, the photos I get from this camera are easily as pretty to look at as what comes out of that much larger T2i. The main thing you need to do is fool around a LOT, find out what light does to your images and how to make your camera take advantage of the light, and use good compositional sense while you do it. You're bound to have some images turn out right; even more so with the G12. I get more good shots with this camera than I do with my big rig because it's actually with me when the photo op arrives.If you like making photographs and want a P&S; that will give you ACRES of room to grow in your ability, this machine will constantly surprise you. If you are an SLR shooter tired of lugging the monster around and worrying about thousands of dollars in glass instead of playing with your friends and family, the G12 will help you make a large portion of the images you're used to while letting you have a good time. Great vacation or spur-of-the-moment camera. If you are considering a Rebel XS or XSi as your main camera, DROP THE CHALUPA. You will be far happier with this. Until you can step up to the next level of sensors, all that money you'll have in glass is sort of half wasted on the low-end SLRs. If you're planning to get a better camera at some point, then sure, the XSi will do in a pinch. But to equal the performance of the lens on the G12 you'll have to spend a pretty penny on aftermarket glass. The lens on this thing is really good.So Canon, if you really want to get my attention, drop the crop sensor from the T2i into this camera! I know, I know, it would require a complete lens redesign and cost a couple hundred more.IT WOULD ALSO BE WORTH IT. Give me that camera!UPDATE 1-12-2012:Wow, Canon read my review before I wrote it and updated the G12 to the G1x, with a beautiful 14.1 MP sensor of nearly APS-C size. We're taking over six times the real estate of the G12/S95 sensor for truly massive increases in pixel size, light sensitivity and color selectivity. The increased refraction angles inherent in the large surface area sensor mean that soft backgrounds are going to be a specialty of this camera. The new sensor also means that the f/2.8 lens speed goes from \"good enough\" to \"really good.\" Because the MASSIVELY increased size of the individual pixels means that low light performance will be significantly enhanced. I'm putting my G12 on the market TODAY. Perhaps my S95 as well if I need the scratch to pay for this thing, though I'd rather hang onto the minicam.I was pretty sure the G12 would be the last in the G series--because my S95 does almost everything the G12 can do. But THIS? This is game on. It totally redefines the G series. Yes, it is a couple hundred more as I predicted. Did I also say it would be worth it? Up until now the players in the large sensor fixed lens field were the Fuji X100 at $1400 and a &2000 Leica. To me $799 is a stretch of the budget. You really have to commit at the prices of the G1 X's competition.Its true competition is the mirrorless interchangeable-lens category from Sony, Olympus and Panasonic. People rapidly find with those cameras they're still carrying a bag of accessories around like their old SLR but their pics aren't as nice, lens and flash selection is sparse and they prefer a Canon or Nikon SLR. Canon has decided to compete against that market by offering a compromise of better compact convenience, image quality and simplicity against multiple lens flexibility. I think the G1 X will win a significant portion of potential mirrorless slr customers.Looks like it will ship around April. My preorder is in, so I have that amount of time to get my low-exposure-count G12 to a new owner. I'm sure that person will be thrilled with the G12, truly one of the best in its price class. If I were looking in the $400 price range the G12 is my camera. Yes, the G1 X is twice that, and there are DSLRs with bigger sensors and more capabilities for equal money. But I have one of those, a T2i. It's a great camera. But when I'm carrying it, I have to carry a big bag around. That's why I own the G12, and that's why I will own its successor. The G12 has so much instant tactile control and functions very similarly to the T2i. It is a fabulous travel camera that attracts far less attention than a DSLR. No, you don't get super zoom capability and super shallow depth of field for arty shots. But the G12 is so competent at getting the shot I'm going for that most of the time I don't need any more camera. Going for the G1 X to retain the basic G12 form factor and extend the capability. At their respective price points both the G12 and the G1 X are significantly ahead of the pack. I love that Canon is pushing the envelope in this specialized class.Canon, the G12 is a MAGNIFICENT camera, and the G1 X promises to push the G series to legendary status. I am very excited the company chose to move in this direction. This machine has the potential to best the X100 at just over half the price.THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "best of the point and shoots", "Author": "Cerise \"Major Foodie\"", "ReviewID": "R9LJKOTKX4TGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a serious photographer who knows what she's doing. I wanted a small, light weight point and shoot to have with me when I don't want to carry around my big SLR. I tested the G12 against the Lumix LX5. Although the Lumix had slightly better image quality the rest of the G12 won out. The swivel LED, the quickness of changing controls, built-in viewfinder, and most of all the longer telephoto aspect of the lens were the deciding factors. I wish that both cameras had an image quality that would allow me to make very large prints but if I keep them at about 14 inches the pictures look great. I have made enlargements up to 3 feet but had to reduce noise first in Photoshop.  Nevertheless, for ease of use and tons of options I definitely recommend the G12. There is very slight fringing in high contrast areas but the image is sharp from side to side. The smallest aperture is F8 but that is the same with the Lumix.

The camera is easy to use, is small with adequately sized controls, and the video quality excellent.

I like the \"portability\" of this camera because bottom line, I do not want to haul around a DSLR. It's simply too bulky and heavy. For most non protographer shooters, this camera is more than excellent in its performance.The construction is tight, the function rich and when u want to turn it into a P and S, just set it to AUTO. On the other hand, u want it to do more, u have manual controls to set to your desire.There are some things I miss about this camera. I do wish they kept the time lapse feature, but my biggest gripe is not the camera, but the fact that Canon decided to cut cost on the owner manual. U can either download it from their site or get it on the CD, but come on, at $500, they can afford to give us an owners manual, so we don't have to view it on the computer screen, or print out 214 pages from our printer.

I finally moved to a Micro Four Thirds system for reasons I'll get into later.  But the fact that the G12 didn't quite meet my needs in no way diminishes my general opinion of it as an excellent camera.The G12 is solidly built.  It won't go into many pockets, but it's not overly heavy.  The fit and finish oozes quality.  The rotating controls are solid and generous (a mode dial, a dedicated ISO knob, a dedicated exposure compensation knob, a front dial, and a rear rotary dial).  The rear rotary dial doubles as a set of four-way buttons, and this common design is always tricky to use, but you'll develop the muscle memory to use it effectively.If you've never used an articulated display, it is a joy.  It's hard to understand how useful it is until you use it, and it's something I really miss with my new camera.  As with everything else, the G12's implementation of this feature is first-rate.  It's easy to move it around, but you never feel like it's going to fall apart in your hands.  It makes all kinds of composition easier: shooting from the hip, lifting the camera into the air, shooting around corners, getting into tricky positions.  Don't underestimate this feature.  The screen is nice and bright, and you get a good view of your pictures.The lens is worthy of the Canon name.  Nice and sharp.  It's fairly bright at the wide angle, but the f/2.8 is clearly one of the compromises for getting a 5x zoom lens; that is, it's one of the factors in the G12's indoor-light struggles.The sensor is significantly bigger than that of most compact cameras, but it's still a small-sensor camera.  Despite this, the image quality is superb.  Colors are natural and pleasing in most lighting conditions.  Where the small sensor size hurts the G12 is by making it difficult to shoot indoors without flash.The provided flash is fairly powerful, but its positioning close to the lens makes it prone to red-eye.  If you buy a G12, do yourself a favor and invest in the 270EX or 270EXII flash.  G12 + 270EX is a great indoor combination, and that particular flash is perfect for the G12's size.  You can also bounce light off a surface (for example, the ceiling) with the 270EX, and that can make a huge difference in getting natural-looking lighting.The G12's autofocus speed is lackluster.  My primary subjects are my children, and I was never able to get candid shots exactly when I wanted to.  The autofocus is accurate, and things like subject tracking and face recognition are very well done.  It's GOOD at focusing, just not fast at focusing.  The G12 does have a manual focus option, but it's frankly not even worth mentioning.The viewfinder is useful on occasion.As nice as the G12 is, shooting with it gave me a good education in what I wanted in my next camera.  I wanted to be able to take pictures indoors without a flash, and without cranking the ISO way up.  I wanted to be able to isolate subjects with selective focus, but the G12's slow-at-telephoto lens and small sensor really make that difficult.  And I wanted an autofocus system that would let me get candid shots immediately.I found what I was looking for in an Olympus Micro Four Thirds system, but there are things about the G12 I regret leaving behind.  The articulated display, the nice array of manual controls, and even little things like an orientation sensor, are not included in my new camera.  And getting a decent macro will require me to buy a macro lens, whereas the G12 can take very nice macro shots.I got some great pictures with the G12 in the last year.  I got some great sports shots, despite the slow autofocus, but anticipating the action.  I got some great indoor shots by maximizing available light and using the shoe-mounted flash.  So its limitations can be handled.  But it's at its best with things that don't move fast that are outdoors.  Landscapes, nature photography and daytime street shooting are the G12's strengths.

However, having taken more than 10,000 photos with the G7, a total achieved from use between my wife and myself, the image sensor of the G7 began to intermittently \"flicker\" with horizontal noise lines pulsating across the screen. These lines actually come out on some the images. So we knew it was time to ether repair or replace our G7. We opted to get the G12 because of Amazon's low price. The G7 uses the Canon Digic 3 processor and the G12 uses the Digic 4 processor. Both cameras are 10 Megapixel. But in using our new G12, right from the very first image we shot, it became immediately apparent that Canon has made huge progress in improving the G-Series PowerShot cameras! The images are now brighter, crisper, lines and edges are more sharp, the contrast is more accurate with darker blacks and truer whites, the colors are more vivid and the manner in which the camera is now able to automatically sense when to go from normal into macro focus, the new G12 is even easier to use than our G7. We also appreciate the new, larger, higher resolution screen, plus the fact that the screen now articulates; a feature we had missed on the G7 that our old Canon A80 had. We've had our G12 only about a month and we highly recommend this camera as possibly the best, affordable digital rangefinder-type camera on the current market.

Merigan", "ReviewID": "R165EE4I2JQC44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fairly happy with the image quality of my Canon ELPH but wanting more control over the picture-taking process, I set about hunting down the Next Big Thing to own, camerawise. A dSLR was tops on my list, till I priced 'em and realized I'd likely be itchin' to ditch the kit lens with no means of paying for an upgrade.I honed in on the G12 and S95, as I was familiar with the Canon line and have read much about their comparative high picture quality. Both cams had their strengths, but in the end I decided if I *must* have a highly compact cam on me, the ELPH would suffice, whereas the G12 came bundled with extra goodies vs. the S95 and isn't really all that clunky - not by a mile, compared to a dSLR.What I didn't realize is how much I would love one of those goodies - the flip (\"articulating\") screen. The screen immediately coaxed me to consider shot angles I might not otherwise have contemplated. Plus, I found myself preferring to hold the G12 at waist level with me looking down at the upturned screen, like an old-fashioned camera with the viewfinder on the top. If you like the idea of a flip screen but haven't played around with one for still shots, I highly recommend the experience.Strengths (for me):* Screen (duh) (even if it's not the highest-res one out there).* The front-mounted toggle to the right of the lens - pure inspiration, and the go-to component in full-on manual mode (the only mode I really use) to control shutter speed/exposure.* The very friendly, old-school film-speed wheel atop the cam body.* RAW image option. (Albeit, a complete space hog, both on the memory card and on my hard drive - I've had to purchase a second drive to keep up with my output.)* Wicked nice shots, or (for me) at least wicked nice raw material to massage in Photoshop (I can't leave stuff alone, that way).Weaknesses:* Truly hate that the manual focus is controlled by the little menu flywheel on the back. Because the wheel responds to press commands as well as turn commands, I'm constantly pressing a shot mode by mistake when trying to fine tune the focus, plus the small wheel doesn't allow for the sort of gradual adjustment you can get with a lens ring.* Limited f-stops (2.8 - 8.0). But this is just my experience with my old SLR talkin'; if there's a wider range available at this price point, I haven't learned about it. Nevertheless, I haven't had issues with clarity through the field depth at 8.0, at least at the limited sizes I print at (no poster sizes for me at this point).* Lack of optical zoom beyond 5X. This actually may be a deal breaker for me. You see, I'm a control nut when it comes to composing my shots, and I really want the option to go beyond 5X without dipping into digital zoom (and in JPEG format only, to boot), which can get me the effects I want but at a clear cost of clarity. Not that I'm all about the bird/wildlife shots. I just really like having greater control over how the background sizes up comparatively to the foreground. [Big ol' aside: If you're a fan, like me, of the flick \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,\" you may recall a shot of Steve Martin walking from a car rental lot to the nearby airport hub while a rather large-ish jet plane screams by as it lands apparently just a few dozen yards from Martin. That's what a long-lens can do with how closer and farther images are perceived in a given shot (because of course Martin was nowhere near so close to the runway). Also, directors might call up long-range lenses for movies where they want to convey a cramped, claustrophobic feeling, such as aboard a submarine.]Now, when I say deal breaker, I mean that I've had my G12 for some three months, now, have fired off well over a two thousand  shots, and have only recently gotten the itch to explore something like the Canon SX30IS, with a megaton more of available optical zoom, albeit at a loss of access to shooting RAW. At this price point, one must make tough choices.A note about the design: When you're toting a G12 around with you, you may notice everyone else's digicams look so cool and sleek, whereas you've basically got a little black brick. Experienced photogs, of course, would eye the blessing of chunky controls on the top and note you've got a Serious Person's cam. But to everyone else, you may feel like a nerd who purchased too big and boring of a cam compared to the little silver and color-keyed models most folks tote. But you weren't shopping for a fashion accessory, were ya? Of course not.So, would I recommend it the G12?

Then, miraculously, both Nikon and Canon released in September and October, respectively, a new top of the line \"point and shoot\", but in reality it's really a hybrid P&S;/DSLR.  I researched endlessly, reading reviews of every nature comparing, head to head, the Nikon Coolpix (i hate that name, to start with) P7000 versus the Canon Powershot (better, i guess I'd rather have \"power\" than be \"cool\" and the \"pix\" part is just childish sounding) G12.  The reviews and reviewers were pretty much split down the middle, about half saying \"yea, Nikon!\" and the other half saying \"yea, Canon\".Even though the Nikon is about $50 less expensive and every penny counts to me, there finally was a decision for the Canon G12 and I'm very, very happy so far.  What i wanted most as a photographer is present in both cameras -- namely the ability to shoot in RAW.  The Canon felt, in its make and heft (I wanted a camera that didn't look like a throwaway) looks more like a serious camera than the Nikon.  And the Canon G12 has an adjustable tilt LCD which matters to me as I'm in any number of my photos (the Nikon's screen is fixed).I didn't care that the Nikon has a bigger zoom (my work is more structured/theatrical and story-oriented, and when I'm shooting for gallery work, I don't really zoon).  I laugh aloud at the quibblers who are all over Canon, berating Canon for only having a 2.8\" screen, rather than a 3\" screen (get real, people, that's just silly....)  My biggest concern with the Nikon was that many reviewers were saying that the shots come slowly when shooting in RAW.  I don't know if that's true or not.  I made sure I got the fastest best memory card that's made for the Canon, and it's feeling very responsive.I'm sure the Nikon is a swell camera; it just comes down to the minute features that matter to you most.  Bottom line is they both shoot in RAW without having to juryrig your Canon with CHDK (which worked very well on a Canon Powershot I had that's now no longer made).  I hated that Canon couldn't have coughed up the expense of including a real manual (you get to download it to your computer and then print out 275 pages), but maybe Nikon doesn't do that either.  You get past it.  I was doing just fine simply using some creativity with a webcam and then a P&S; -- sometimes having less money makes you actually think and create, rather than be obsessed about buttons and gadgets.  That said, I'm really thrilled that both Canon and Nikon have created something reachable (you know your income bracket when the photo magazines and blogs call a $1000 DLSR a \"backup\" camera to have around, just because.Anyway, I love my Canon G12 so far, and there's no indication I won't continue to love it.

The G12 has virtually all the control of a DSLR. However there were two areas I was frustrated with. The shutter lag is much longer than on the Canon 50D, not as bad as on some earlier point and shoots but still significant. The other is it's depth of field capabilities.

Based on a series of `specs' I devised, I narrowed my search to the G12, and the Nikon P7000.  These seemed like proper `spiritual successors' to my beloved Oly.  I briefly considered returning to an SLR (I've owned film units and have several older Canon EOS lenses), but just wanted a smaller, more easy to live with form factor.  Once I held them both, the Canon just seemed like the better choice.After living with it for a week, here are my first impressions.  Don't be put off by my comments - this is a terrific camera.  But it could have been better:1) For me lots of externally accessible manual controls was a must-have.  I was tired of searching thru menus for basics.  But who's idea was it to delete the printed manual???  This is a highly complex machine with knobs & buttons that in some cases serve multiple functions depending on the mode of operation.  Shooting/experimenting on the road with the .pdf manual at home on my desktop really bites.  I've printed out some guide material that I found on the previous G11, and will invariably have to print some of the manual as well.  I'm an electrical engineer with a firm understanding of optics & sensors, yet I'm still finding the learning curve to be steep!It has a great looking body, however, ergonomics could be better.  The various dials are a bit hard to move, particularly the front dial which like all Canon high end models is meant to be rotated with the index finger alone.  The lens zoom nub is way too small, and I keep slipping off of it.  And I keep hitting the * AE lock button by accident!  And countless times I partially blocked the flash output with my finger.  Oly did it better with the flash closer to the middle of the body.  I also miss the man-sized right grip.  Adding another few millimeters out to the plane of the retracted lens would have been nice.  I don't feel secure `one handing' the camera (at least not yet...). The lens ring is a tease - for show only.  It's too bad, as I would have loved an easy to use manual control of focus.  I believe that the S-95 (similar electronics in a compact body has a functional ring.2) An optical viewfinder was also essential.  I hate electronic viewfinders, and squinting at an LCD display in either bright sunlight or near total darkness is not for me.  It's also great as a battery saver.  Last weekend at 200 shots and several movies into a function, the battery icon began to flash.  I switched off the monitor and completed the next hour and 50+ shots with power to spare.  But this one is barely a viewfinder.  Not even a simple crosshairs?  And it is a bit far inboard.  The LCD monitor now has lots of nose prints!  The Oly had the viewfinder further to the left.  Again, great idea, poor execution.3) I miss the loss of a superfast f1.8 lens.  But compensating is the commendably low noise imaging chip that more than buys back several stops in low light situations.  I ran to ISO 1600 with respectable results.  And the image stabilizer is awesome!  I was knocking off back to back sub fifteenth of a second exposures with no blur.  Who needs a flash?4) No IR remote?  I loved the convenience of putting the old camera on a tripod and snapping off multiple shots without the need to be anywhere near it.5) I doubt that I will use RAW for casual shooting (too much post processing required), but the highest yield JPEG is still over-compressed for my taste.  I'm guessing something around 8:1, yielding files of about 2.1 meg from the 9 meg sensor.  (yes it says 10 meg if you want to shoot 3:4, but if you like 2:3 for easy 4\" x 6\" prints without cropping each one, you'll probably shoot in the reduced sensor region).  I suspect that you could do greater cropping & enlargements if the camera supported lower compression (3:1 maybe?).  Who cares if the files are larger?  5 meg would be fine, considering memory is virtually free and unlimited!  I bought a 16 gig SDHC (speed rated `10') card for under $30, and the camera indicates I can shoot 6,700 photos or hours of video with this size card!6) Speaking of video, I was quite happy with normal room lit 720 x 1280 movies.  Yes, 1080 would have been nice, but this is still tons better than my 4 year old HDD camcorder that shoots at VGA and is more low light challenged!  But why not allow continuous autofocus and exposure control?  I could live with a little mechanical noise in exchange for better tracking of moving objects.Net of all this?

I knew about the necessary evils of photography from the beginning and wanted a camera where the accessories would not put me in debt. I wanted a camera with the portability of a point and shoot but also with the fun of a DSLR. The G12 satisfied all my requirements:- DSLR-quality photos even on auto modeAs I'm still learning about photography, many of my pictures are in auto mode. The pictures are almost as pleasing as the Canon T2i.- PortableWith an actual DSLR, you cannot carry it everywhere you go. My sister-in-law has a DSLR and she seldom ever uses her DSLR anymore. Instead, she uses her iPhone--ugh... She's tried to lend me her DSLR before and the first things I realized when her camera bag was in my lap were: too many accessories and too big.

How often do you kick yourself for not having your DSLR?  How often do you leave the house and say to yourself 'nah, I don't feel like lugging it along'?  This little camera has solved the 'dowp I wish I had my camera problem' for me 100%.  The images I am getting are as good if not better than those I have gotten with my 20D and the key is that I am getting the images because I have the camera all the time.  Rangefinder is not quite useless but I guarantee you wont want to use it much.  The large swiveling LCD is just amazingly bright and accurate and will allow you to get shots you could never pull off if you had to be viewing through the rangefinder.  5 star point and shoot performance but the camera really comes to life in the program mode and manual modes.  Really more versatile than my full size DSLR.  Very comfortable to wear over the shoulder.  Designed such that it lays flat against the rib cage and does not bob or swing at all.  I do not even feel that it is there really.  I think this is a great camera for people who do like to shoot in non automatic modes and geek out a little bit with their photography.  If you just want a point and shoot this is overkill.Two things to know before you buy: 1. It is true that the function set button in the center of the control dial on the right rear of the camera is placed in such a way that it is very very easy to depress with the base of your thumb and change your settings in very significant ways.  On a recent outing I ended up shooting all of my shots in a 1:1 ratio (little squares!) because of this issue.  This is a camera for a person who does not mind being alert and watchful vis a vis what the camera is up to from shot to shot.  I do feel that I will be able to overcome this button issue with more practice and the development of some muscle memory.  2. Zooming in and zooming out is very slow and clunky on this camera..just know that...this is not the camera to use for really fast paced shot composition.Bottom line?

McDonald", "ReviewID": "R1H3AUKZXC9Q8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a small time semi-pro since the early 90s.  Although I will never pass up a chance to take a picture at anytime of anything or anyone that might create a beautiful image, my passion centers around outdoor photography when I travel.  As I imagine, anyone with internet access can view and read everyone's opinion and take of the G12 - every button, mode, and nuance has been examined like an alien from Area 51.  With that I will give you my personal take from my perspective.The last seven years has seen my bank account quite lean so my instrument purchases have had to be well thought out and planned.  I would say my \"photography personality type\" would be someone that will agonize over every technical capability and detail of a camera or accessory before a purchase, but after, resolves to the skill of artist to create beautiful and captivating images.  That new camera will not improve your images.  That new camera may increase your chances of getting the image you're envisioning, but without envisioning, the only thing that will change is your bank account.Although I had \"fiddled\" with this camera for weeks, my first real impression of this camera was when I went to my youngest daughter's ballet dress rehearsal.  This is far better than trying to get great shots of your kid at the final event (there's not as many people there, the stage and lighting most likely will be the same, and there is usually do overs for you to capitalize on).  The ease at which I was able to manipulate this camera on the fly was remarkable and far and above any camera I have used to date.  The array of dials, on top, in back, and in front give me the control I want at an instant.  Rarely did I have to dip into depths of electronic menus to tweak what I wanted.  Any camera I purchase from here out will be compared with what I have in the G12.  And this from a person who really never considered this quality in a camera before this purchase.If you end up getting this camera and find yourself dissatisfied with the image quality I will confidently put you in a particular category.  That category which a person spends far too much time inspecting their images on a computer screen at an enlargement size nobody would really consider printing unless they produced billboards.I have an expanse of cameras to fit different types of situations but the G12 fits a niche that can't be satisfied by anything I have to date.  I wanted a camera (and its accompanying system) that I could simply \"grab a small bag\" and have everything I needed for a weekend trip to the coast, two weeks in Hawaii, or a month in India.  And believe that if I nabbed that once in a lifetime shot, I would not forever bemoan the final print for lack of image quality, key filter, or perfect lens.  I have a Domke bag (700-51B F-5XA) that is roughly the size of a Scooby-Doo lunch pale from the 70s.  In it I have everything I need: every filter I can imagine needing (seven in total) all in a stack cap filter case; three batteries and the AC charger; macro ring flash; wide lens converter along with the adapter to mount it; lens shade; Gorillapod; LensMate filter/lens adapter; intervalometer (which also doubles as a remote shutter release); hand strap; and a white balance lens cap. I also have a small camera case that will sometimes go with me that is about the size of a Pop Tarts box.Must have features that led me to pick this camera and system: optical viewfinder - despite reviews I have read, this viewfinder is every bit as good as ANY viewfinder from a camera of this size that I have used in the last thirty-five years of playing with cameras - also a necessary component for discreet shooting, bright day shooting, and steady hand-held shooting; fully articulating screen - makes overhead, waist level and floor shooting easier and/or possible - also flips about to conceal/protect the LCD screen which adds protection and another valuable component of discreet shooting; tried and true and ever-tweaked (over the years) optical stabilization; hot shoe for external flash; size - small enough to be considered a compact - a camera and its system being any bigger would be subject to me opting to leave it home because I don't want to haul all that equipment around; price - this is a very important consideration but not for what you may think - when traveling, I don't want to consider the total price of the \"bag of tools\" so expensive that I leave it behind for fear of being stolen or broken - all in all have the camera with me more often means more pictures and a better chance of being equipped when that \"great shot\" presents itself.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The G Series just keeps getting better", "Author": "firewallbill \"firewallbill\"", "ReviewID": "R1IJ9QDCPRZUPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Canon G series since the G6, I moved to Canon from the Epson product line.I tend to skip generations.I used to be a full time pro, but now just like to carry a camera for family shots, the occasional artistic opportunity, and fun.The Canon G series really is well designed for this purpose.Improvements: The HS is a serious improvement in image quality. Skin tones are much more natural, colors more faithful without being over-saturated or washed out.  On a couple of recent Scout outings, with firelight pictures, the quality was acceptable.Exposure in challenging circumstances (back lit, overcast, strong point light source, etc.) are much better.I would hardly use a camera like this for \"serious\" video, but the quality is more than acceptable for fun & interest.Canon brought back the articulating back!  Much appreciated.And, a subtlety - if you are familiar with any one Canon G series you can easily find your way around the next in the line. I moved from the G9 to the G12 and didn't even need to open the manual.The camera is faster focusing, faster saving images, and overall has a snappier feel.Some lament the optical finder, but occasionally it really is useful.  In scenarios where you don't want to cause a distraction using the screen, this is very useful. It's pretty wimpy compared to an SLR type optical viewfinder, but it works when needed.Battery life seems very good, I can fill up a 16GB chip with 100's of images and no issues with battery.  From the G6 to the G12 Canon has continued to improve battery life.Form factor - the camera fits the hand well, ergonomically it's a good design.  The top buttons have been rearranged to allow for easier access to exposure over-ride and exposure \"speed\".  That took a minute to re-acquaint.  It's a very nice design.Desires:Really, it's time Canon put a FASTER lens on this line.  It just seems odd they are stuck on a slow 2.8.  Why?Built in WiFi would be very useful.For now, that's it.

Finally I found the Canon G12, and I am thrilled with it.  I am amazed that they can get such fabulous image quality on a sensor that is just barely bigger than most point-and-shoot cameras (and with 'only' 10MP) but the image quality, low light performance, and ergonomics are all superb.  I love having so much control right at my fingertips without having to dig into menus, and despite having 'only' a 5X optical zoom, the digital zoom is really quite usable.

The guy at the camera shop said 1: you can't really clean these, they're disposable, and 2: this camera had enough clicks on it that it wouldn't be reliable.  So much for supporting local camera shops... as soon as I got it home the card stopped responding reliably, and there's no easy way to tell if the card is bad, or the camera is making the card go bad...So, long story not so long, I asked a professional photographer friend of mine what I should do - spend $900 or $1300 for a new Nikon that supports all my lenses?  He said, sure, and also get a Canon G12.  More reliable, equivalent photo quality, great zoom range, and about 1/8 the size, when you factor in lenses.  And of course 1/2- 1/4 the cost.  Knowing that the best travel photos are the impromptu quick shots, I decided to hold off on replacing the Nikon and just take the Canon - what a great decision!  The photos are fabulous, the battery life is amazing, even with lots of flashes, and the ability to quickly and accurately set manual or program settings is actually easier than on the Nikon!  I shot mostly with Aperature Priority, and some with shutter Priority, but I could also set it for full auto in about 1/2 second, hand the camera to somebody else, and be in a great shot.  Being able to flip the screen around lets you take pictures of yourself and family easily, and the screen has lots of different options for settings and playback that makes it great to look at.  I got lots of compliments on the camera and the photos.  My only wish is that I could get a little bit wider angle shots - I'm an architect and take lots of wide angle interior and exterior pictures of buildings, but it wouldn't have been worth travelling with the big camera just for those times when I wanted the extra view width.  I'd probably agree with other reviewers that the viewfinder isn't very useful.

Honestly, I cannot say anything bad about it. I used a G10 for two years and decided to upgrade to the G12. I was pleased to see that I could trade-in my G10 through Amazon. And here is where my review gets ugly. I decided to post this here--even though it doesn't really belong here--because I think it is where anyone who is thinking about trading in a G10 will be most likely to read it. And I want to warn as many people as possible so they are not ripped off by a dishonest merchant like I was.On the day I decided to trade-in my camera, the trade-in value for the G10 was advertised as $199 for \"Like New\" condition and $153.50 for \"Good\" condition. In my honest opinion, my G10 was \"Like New,\" and I still had the original box and all accessories. I thought $199 was a fair value, so I packaged up my G10 and sent it in. I requested that it be returned to me if the condition was not found to be \"Like New.\"Upon receipt and inspection, the merchant informed me that the condition was not \"Like New,\" but rather was \"Good\" because it was \"lightly scratched\" (his exact words). I thought about it and decided that $153.50 was fair, even though the camera was not visibly scratched. I called Amazon immediately to tell them I would accept the trade-in value of $153.50 and to try to stop the camera from being returned to me. I was told it was too late; the camera had already been shipped. Interestingly, however, I checked the UPS tracking system, and the camera actually did not ship out until two days later.In any event, I decided to wait until the camera was returned to me, and then resubmit it as a new trade-in. When I received the camera back, I was very upset to see that the merchant had packed it only in an envelope, and not a box with bubble wrap inside, as I had. This resulted in the camera box being damaged during shipment. So I found another box and packaged it up correctly, so it wouldn't be damaged in transit. This time, I specified that I would accept the trade-in value EVEN IF THE CONDITION WAS DOWNGRADED. How could that happen, right? I mean, the camera was inspected only a few days earlier, and the merchant determined that its condition was \"Good.\"First indication of a problem: As I was completing the online form to submit the trade-in, I noticed the advertised trade-in values had changed dramatically from just one week earlier, and the value of a G10 in \"Good\" condition was now only $123.50. I called Amazon to inquire about this and was told that merchants are free to change their pricing whenever they like. I suppose that's true, but this still seemed really shady, since the merchant knew I had just submitted the camera for trade-in and now wanted to accept the originally advertised value of $153.50 for the condition it was rated. Amazon offered me a $10 promotional credit for my trouble.Today, I received an email from the merchant, who said he received and inspected my G10 and rated its condition as \"Acceptable\"--not \"Good,\" as he had only one week earlier--due to \"some flaws (e.g., dead spots or scratches in display), and minor cracks or dents\" (his exact words). So yes, somehow the condition of my camera changed significantly within only a few days. Last week, it was only \"lightly scratched,\" but this week, it had \"flaws, dead spots, scratches, cracks and dents???\" I can assure you it did not. And here's the best part: Since I had specified I would accept whatever condition and trade-in value the merchant determined upon inspection, I was given only $70--and not the originally promised $153.50--because the condition of my camera was somehow now only \"Acceptable.\"I am EXTREMELY upset. I contacted Amazon and was told nothing can be done because Amazon has no control over merchants. I find that really hard to believe, since Amazon facilitates the trade-in program, and an unscrupulous merchant like this one will clearly harm Amazon's reputation. Amazon would not even identify the merchant, so I have no way of contacting the merchant directly or submitting a formal complaint. So essentially, as I see it, Amazon permitted the merchant to \"steal\" my camera. I cannot believe Amazon would allow this to happen to a customer, and a very loyal customer at that.

At the time, I was looking at 6 other cameras: Ricoh GR Digital IV, Samsung TL500, Olympus XZ-1, Canon S100, Nikon P7100, & Panasonic LX5.  Canon G1X, Sony RX100, and Fujifilm X10 were not out yet.  - Ricoh & Samsung ruled out because of poor zoom (1X & 3X); cutoff was 3.5X  - Scoffed at the XZ-1 because I was convinced that optical IS was MUCH better than sensor shift IS.  (Could eat those words, because I have this camera on order as a complement to the G12.)  - Canon S100 was my dream camera at the start of the search: 2.0 aperture & 24mm.  But discovered that I hated menues & loved external controls; S100 didn't feel right.  - Nikon P7100 had the best zoom, great external controls though not to my liking, but was turned off by partially articulated display, less dynamic range, and slow as the G12. Very close.  - Panasonic LX5 was the speed demon of my top 3 choices, but disliked the controls & inferior image quality compared to the G12.  2.0 aperture, 24mm lens, & largest sensor of my top 4 choices were its strengths.  It was in my Amazon.com cart, when I went to handle the G12.G12's attractions:  1) Large sensor (1/1.7) compared to other P&S; cameras,  2) Great control layout,  3) Excellent image quality,  4) Self-closing lens cap,  5) Articulated LCD display can be protected by folding it in on itself,  6) Images can be saved as RAW (.CR2),  7) Ability to add filters; ND filter built-in,  8) Good zoom,  9) PASM (wanted to learn how to use these modes),  10) Great macro mode, and  11) Pocketable; if you have large pockets.  Will not fit in a shirt & jeans pocket.That was BEFORE I bought it.  One of its modes is HDR (High Dynamic Range); take 3 photos at diffent exposures & merges them ... requires a tripod.  Use this when photographing a scene with a bright sky, shaded area, and normal landscape.  Sky is darkened to make it a deep blue, detail is exposed in the shaded area.  AEB mode is better because you can control the aperture & don't need a tripod ... but you will need software such as SNR (personal favorite), Photomatix, etc, etc.  Latest version of DPP (included) merges photos, just not as good as the commercial packages.Why not 5 stars? Video is bad, and didn't realize until tonight when I used a Nikon P310, had bad the video quality really is.  It's also slow, but I knew that before I bought it.If the G12 isn't for you, consider one of the others mentioned.Update Wed, 4-Jul-2012: Between having the Olympus XZ-1 for a week, and playing with a B+W polarizing filter, I was too harsh in this review ==> changing from 4 to 5 stars.  Olympus did some things better than Canon, but the controls & menus are much better for the G12.

The internal noise reduction keeps photos even up to ISO 3200 usable. Above ISO 800 the photos start to show some noise but you are able to capture some usable pictures that other compact camera's wouldn't be able to touch at all. The G12 puts a lot of the controls at your fingertips so you don't have to keep going into the menu to change settings. The ability to adjust the settings on the fly is a huge plus. I also like the ability to fold the viewer screen in on itself to protect it when putting it in your pocket or the camera bag. The camera is a bit on the chubby side for a compact but I have not had any issues carrying it around. Short of an SLR the pictures the G12 puts out are stunning. The exposure is rarely off when I evaluate it after the fact in Aperture. Like other reviewers the only button this doesn't have that would be nice is a dedicated movie mode button.

It's so full of features that it may scare some people away. Although it's a point-and-shoot camera, it does so much more than that.

You can alter exposure speed, light sensitivity, the point of focus; if you want to take multiple shots without waiting for the camera to recycle, you can do that; you can also create sophisticated videos. Every button and control has several functions, and the creative menus (which can also be customized) are extensive. There's so much to learn about the camera, I bought a guide book to teach me all of them. This returns me to my initial point: If you're looking for a good camera which takes good pictures, you can probably do better with one which is less expensive. If you're looking for a very good camera which will allow you to expand your creative potential, you can do very well with this camera.Two additional points. 1.

This year I was faced with the decision of either buying a superzoom (Shortlist: Canon SX230 or Sony HX-9V) or an enthusiast compact (Shortlist: Canon G12, Nikon P7000 and Olympus XZ1). After a long and careful consideration, I decided to go down the enthusiast compact route. The principal reason being I really wanted great image quality close to that of the 7D.The Nikon P7000 was rules out due to the reviews regarding its hit and miss operational speed. The XZ1 is a nice camera but the C12 won at the end as I already have a Canon system. The ability to share accessories such as flashes with the dSLR is an important consideration. Also while others may lament the bulk of the G12. I prefer a bit of bulk to aid stability when holding the camera.In real life usage, the G12 operational speed is impressive. It is almost instant and ready to shoot when you switch it on. There is no perceptible lag in between shoot. The operational speed is far closer to that of a dSLR than the compact cameras. Image quality is also great. The JPG image quality as good as the 7D to the untrained eyes (particularly at ISO400 or below). I have yet to experiment with RAW but I expect great results given all the positive reviews. I also like the dials and switches which allow direct control instead of going through touch screen or screens of menus.My two gripes are the little grip space at the back which means the thumb can hit the control wheels too easily. This takes a bit of getting used to coming from a 7D which has great ergonomics. The other is the OVF which is not really useful useful (show only 80%) and may be only useful under bright sun light. Having said the above, every design has compromises and I can live with design compromises of the G12. The other thing to be aware is the you simply can't do nice bokeh with the little sensor. This limitation is the same for all compacts.In summary. I will take the G12 everywhere when I don't want to lug the 7D around.

Also, the default RAW aspect ratio is locked at 4:3 and cannot be set to 3:2 (only works for JPEG), so there will be a lot of manual cropping needed before printing 4x6 images.  Otherwise, provided you post process the G12 RAW files in DXO to remove lens distortion, chromatic aberration / fringing, vignetting, etc., the G12 is a FANTASTIC point and shoot.  I use Photoshop for levels, color correction, sharpening, cropping, etc.  Honestly, I may never buy another point and shoot again that is not supported in DXO.  The difference is 100% night and day.

I missed my previous camera, a Panasonic Super-zoom that had a 12x lens; I fatally damaged that camera when I slipped on a hike.  I wanted something lighter and more compact so bought the G12.  After 30 months, it started acting up, buttons not working, zoom not responding.  After searching on the internet, I discovered that many others are having this problem. The short-term workaround, to eject and re-insert the memory card worked for a few weeks.  Eventually, I did a total reset, removing the memory card, the battery and reformatting the memory card.  Also tried a different memory card.  The camera became more and more locked up, couldn't delete photos, couldn't zoom, couldn't even access the set up menus to do a total re-boot.I called Canon to see about repairs:  $179 plus about $40 shipping both ways.  As a \"loyal customer\" they would sell me a \"refurbished G12\" for $279 instead.  So a 20 percent discount off their current price for a 4 year old refurbished camera that no one is selling?  Sounds like profit loyalty.  They would NOT allow me buy a G15 or G1 X at discount, full price only.  NO THANKS, Canon.So yesterday I bought a Panasonic Superzoom, DMC-FZ200.  It weighs about the same as the G12.  The processor isn't quite as large, but the display articulates (unlike the G15 and G16), has an optical viewfinder, and 24x zoom.  For super fussy I can use my Nikon DSLR.Sorry, Canon, but your \"Customer Loyalty\" program seems to be more about our loyalty to your brand and your profits, NOT your loyalty to us.  If you had offered me the chance to buy a new/better camera at discount, I might well have done that.  Instead, I'm ticked off that I paid $469 for a supposedly great camera that died in less than 3 years despite being treated with extreme care:  no sand, no water, not bumps, not dropped.  Took baby-tender care of the G12 and it just quit.

The same goes for the G12--the G15 is a big step backwards.  The G12 has a swivel screen which should not be underestimated as a very useful tool.  You can get down low and shoot over your head and not guess what is in the frame.  The direct access to ISO is another feature deleted from the replacement.  I had very few poor shots from the G12 and nearly all were in focus and properly exposed.  Quality feel throughout.  I have read a few reports on the replacement G15 and it is trailing the main competition (Nikon P7700) and not performing as well as the G12 in the sharpness stakes (but said to focus faster and is probably superior for movies).The bottom line:  Canon seem to be going backwards with the G15 and if I was going to buy another serious P&S; it would be the G12 (I also own a Panasonic G3 which I rate 5 stars--best value out there and not much bigger than the G series).  The price has been rising steadily after hitting a rock-bottom three hundred and seventy nine dollars on Amazon to where it is at the time of writing at four hundred and twenty seven or just 20 dollars less than the G15.  The G12 may go classic and Canon could end up having to quickly replace the G15 with a G20 with swivel screen, direct access to ISO and a lens to keep up with Nikon's 28-200mm.  In the meantime, the G12 is top dog in the serious P&S; department.EDIT+++++++++It will not have escaped your attention that the G12 price has soared again.  Now $35 more than the inferior replacement G15.  It goes to show that Camera companies, even Canon, can make mistakes and presume too much on consumers.  Dropping the swivel screen and direct access to ISO with a slightly degraded image quality was not a good move and the market has spoken loud and clear.  Canon need to quickly replace the embarassing G15 with a \"G20\" with everything the G12 has plus a decent viewfinder, full HD movie capability and a faster lens and then it will be worthy of the G name.  In the meantime, as the price of the G12 soars a frenzy may begin to grab the last G12s and who knows, maybe they will be on eBay for $$$ more!!  I am beginning to regret I sold mine now as I have rarely owned an appreciating camera--especially a digital one.EDIT 12/22/12--just checked out the latest price and its now Four hundred and fourty nine and soaring almost 50 bucks above the sinking G15.  How high can it go as the frenzy builds for the very last G12s!!!!  Five hundred by Christmas??EDIT 1/1/13--looks like it just got upped again to a penny short of the big 5-0-0!  This must be unprecendented--the old model soars and soars as people realise that the window is about to shut on brand new G12's.EDIT 1/6/13--wow, FIVE NINE NINE!

I asked my photography friends about recommendations for cameras and one of them suggested that I look at the Canon G12. I know nothing about the ISO, shutter speeds, aperture, etc. so I thought buying a DSLR may be too much money and too high of a learning curve. My needs were to be able to take close up pictures of flowers with blurry background, better action shots of my kids' sports, better nighttime photography, better low light pictures, and so on. I am able to achieve all my photography needs with the G12. It is smaller than a DSLR so you can fit it in a purse or small bag. I love the swivel screen. It does come in very handy. The SCENERY modes are very useful. In fact, my favorite is Color Accent since you can pick a color in a picture, such as red, and the rest of the picture is in black and white. You can do the same thing in Photoshop, but it's very handy to be able to do the processing while you take the picture. The pictures turn out very artsy. The depth of field with this camera is a bit limited when trying to take close ups and you want to blur the background. My photography friend gave me this tip. He told me to shoot in Aperture Priority mode (Av). At the same time, use Zoom to zoom in on your subject. Change the f stop to the smallest setting possible with zoom enabled. Step back more from the subject and zoom in more. Take the picture. Voila! The blurry background is achieved! The Portrait setting in the SCENERY mode supposedly blurs the background, but not enough for me. I'm going to take a local photography class to understand more about basic photography concepts, but I'm sure I will be able to take even more awesome pictures with the Canon G12 after that. Take a look on flickr.com and search for Canon G12. You'll see so many pictures taken with this camera. This camera can take amazing pictures with the proper understanding of how to use its functions.**Review Update 7/30/12***Been using the G12 for several months now and have gotten to know its pros and cons better. The G12 is a great camera to bring on travel. It's smaller size than a DSLR fits nicely into my handbag. The ISO, metering, and shooting mode controls on the top of the camera gives quick access to changing your settings. I took it to Hearst Castle and was able to take pictures indoor without flash for the first time in my life. The last time I went to Hearst Castle, I had my film 35 mm camera where if I turned off the flash, the pictures were too dark because I couldn't adjust anything with my old camera. With the ability to control shutter and aperture, I was able to use the G12 to capture low, light indoor shots and night time photography.The downside of the G12 is that for portraits where you want shallow depth of field (blurry background), you cannot get much blurriness unless you have the subject way in front of the background and stand far away and zoom into the subject. I've also had professional photographers try to help me achieve the look but it just doesn't give me a satisfactory look compared to the lenses on their DSLRs. However, if I'm doing macro photography, such as photographing flowers, I am able to achieve the nice shallow depth of field look, just not with larger subjects.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "BallaghMan", "ReviewID": "R13KQNY4AYI8Z4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fabulous camera for the money.

After having this camera for about 2 weeks now I am super pleased with my choice.Even in full auto it takes great pictures indoors and out. But when you start playing with the various manual options this camera really shines. I really like the low light capabilities, and have taken some really nice shots even by candlelight that turned out every bit as good as my DSLR. And I really like having the ISO settings on an exterior dial instead of a menu.The product does not come with a SD card and I think that is good because every body has their own opinions of what is best and they can buy what ever card seems right for them.It does not come with a printed tech manual, just a quick start guide. The manual is included on the CD that is included with the camera. As I am not too much of a tech manual reader anyway, this didn't bother me but I did purchase David Busch's book for the G12 to help me get the most of my camera. It's a good book and a lot easier reading than a manual.In conclusion ,so far this camera has been everything I hoped it would be and more.

Last year I bought a Canon SLR Xsi and thought it was the best thing ever.  The pictures are awesome and I was very happy with it.  The problem I ran into was its so darn big.  So I left it at home most of the time and dragged along a cheap point and shoot just because I did not want to deal with the extra luggage associated with an SLR.  I started researching the high end point and shoot cameras as a compromise.  It came down to the G12 and the Nikon P7000.  I am somewhat of a Canon purist and ended up with the G12.  Man am I happy with this camera.  It does exactly what I expected.The build quality of this camera is great.  It feels comfortable in my hand and does not at all feel cheep.  It's a bit on the large size as compared to a point and shoot, but it is much smaller than a SLR, so I am very happy about that.  The overall picture quality is impressive.  Its actually a bit better than I expected.  I do not have the trained eye of a professional, but I would rate it close to what my Xsi was producing.  Not quite as good, but close.  The ability to access most of the important functions via dials on the camera has opened up a whole new world for me.  No more chasing down ISO and exposure in the menus.  The camera has a front dial that is customizable also.  It also has a TON of built in features that I wont review, but it is more than I have ever seen on a camera.  Several of the reviews of the video aspects of this camera did scare me, but it is a camera for gods sake and not a camcorder.  From what I can tell so far, the video is just fine, but limited.At the end of the day, this is a slight downgrade from my Xsi, but it is something that will definitively get a ton of use due to it being smaller than a SLR.

I had to complain to their service person and ask to speak with a manager before they finally said they would pay for the work.  They then stressed that this was it...there is no warranty on the work being done.  Guess I'll be looking for a new camera soon!I waited 9 months to write this review to really get a feel for this camera.  It's been okay but not great.  My previous canon took much better (clearer)photos all the time.  I think it's hard to get the macro function to work well without having to pick a focus area repeatedly which means you might lose your picture taking opportunity or get so frustrated you just walk away.The auto option takes so so pictures.

Too many cool things to talk about.  Well worth reading your manual.My biggest issue so far is the lens.  Six months after purchasing it I started to get a spot on every picture I took.  I'm guessing it was dust behind the lens.  At this point I did have one small scratch on the lens which I thought was interesting since I had my previous camera for 4 years with no scratches.  I just wrote it off and said I needed to be more careful.  I sent the camera back to get the dust part fixed and thankfully the scratch was also gone.  I ordered a nifty cleaning device so that this wouldn't happen again.  Well, 3 months later (after the 1st fix), I am having to send it back again to be fixed for multiple scratches on the lens (one being deep enough to show on video and pictures).  I have been extremely anal about cleaning and looking at the lens before taking photos.  I just couldn't figure it out after taking such good care of it.  Well, I finally returned home from a 3 week National Park tour (hopefully, my pics turn out all right) and got online.  Surprise, surprise:  there are numerous comments to be found about: canon g12 scratched lens.  Apparently, people are finding that the shutters that close over the lens when you turn the camera off are scratching the lens.

I have a regular dslr. She had been using a pocket size Canon. Hated it, a mickey mouse camera. Too small, no advanced features, and most important, could not shoot RAW.She wanted a compact camera with no lens to change so this was the choice.This camera a huge improvement. An optical view finder when the sun too bright to see the screen. Can put in Program mode easily. Aperture, priority modes, a better lens, and most important takes a RAW picture. That one feature is so huge. Jpg pictures are so limiting to fix up compared to RAW. For me, RAW a must for any camera.  I think a great 2nd camera. Why 2nd? because I like a larger sensor and larger lens. If this was our one and only, would have bought the new Canon G1X if just wanted one compact camera. This new one has a very larger sensor and larger lens to match the sensor.Been very happy with the picture quality, the extra features, the ability to easily change the white balance. This is basically a compact version of a regular dslr. The camera is advertised as such, and it is true. I would reccomend buying the Dave Busch G12 camera book.

Talking to the Canon technicians, the G12 has no provisions to \"lock out\" the controls, such as a cellular phone can.How it all happened:My camera settings were changing as I was shooting a classic car cruise and I was puzzled as to why.  I found later that the heel of my hand, because of the grip I normally use, was inadvertantly depressing the control buttons, changing my settings arbitrarily.  The controls cannot be set and locked.  This situation can be avoided by using the \"pinch\" method of holding the camera: Put the right forefinger on top and the thumb at the bottom of the camera.

I have had my eye on this for sometime and had a $50 promotional credit so thought I would give it a spin.  Fabulous, Fantastic, awesome photos in auto mode. And in all the preset options.  Which I'm overwhelmingly happy with cause if I wanted to get fancy I would use my SLR.  But not taking that on the Colorado River in Arizona this vacation and chancing getting it wet.

However, I recently found out that I would be deploying for a year overseas and I didn't want to spend money on a camera that would be too big and bulky to take with me.  I swore I would never buy anything but a total compact for quick shots and an uncomprimising DSLR for more deliberate settings, but I ended up making an exception and buying the G12.  I couldn't be happier.The G12 provides plenty of manual controls and acceptable low-light ability in a package small enough to fit in a pouch on my flak jacket where it is accessible all the time.  Additionally, it is built rock solid - I dropped it while getting on a helicopter the other day and it fell 4 or 5 feet, landing on solid rock - not even a scratch.  It is also nice that the screen can be flipped around, so it does not have to be exposed all the time, preventing excessive scratches.  It goes from in your pocket to ready to shoot in just a few seconds with a very short boot-up time, and the shoot settings wheel on the top makes for easy changes without having to navigate through electronic menus - a plus when you are walking or bouncing up and down in a vehicle or helicopter. Some of the complaints in other reviews are valid:1.  I've always been a fan of an optical viewfinder, and when I bought this camera I planned to keep the screen tucked away for protection, exclusively using the viewfinder.  However, I found that the viewfinder does not provide an accurate representation of the size of the frame, and the result was lots of cropping later - I have since started using the screen to compose my shots with much better results.  It could probably go away without breaking my heart, but I do like having it there as an option.2.  I am typically wearing thick leather gloves while shooting, so a larger rear control wheel and buttons would be nice.Other than these minor complaints, this camera is great, and I couldn't be happier with the quality that I have come to expect (this is my 4th Canon).

You know how it is...you're at dinner or at a club at night where the lighting is so low that you have to turn the flash on only to get the people washed out or red eye or have the background totally in darkness, the low light setting gets rid of this problem.  It's awesome!  THe only thing is that I feel like it actually makes people look a little wider when I use this setting.  NOt sure, but this is what it seems like to me.  lol.Also note that this is not a tiny compact camera.  It won't fit in your pants pocket or anything. It's pretty bulky and heavy, but the fact it has the low light level setting and the the swivel viewfinder makes it ok for me.  The swivel viewfinder makes it very convenient to frame self pics with friends.My friends pics usually come out really great, but the reds in my closeups sometimes comes out a little too saturated..  I think there is a setting to fix this, but I just haven't found it yet.  But overall, I like this camera.

I have used this as my travel camera abroad when I wasn't interested in bringing my larger setup and it performed very well. I found handheld self portraits to be a breeze, thanks to the swiveling hinged LCD screen. Because this model doesn't accommodate multiple detachable lenses, you can't go super creative, but the creative modes allow reasonable flexibility. The built-in HDR preset does a pretty good job. It's not done in postprocessing, so you get what you get, and I was generally impressed. When I attempted to take 3 different exposures in RAW and put it through an HDR program on the computer, the particular file type made the finished merge a very red/pink hue that couldn't be changed....so keep that in mind.

Westland", "ReviewID": "R1UZGCD1C3O1K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the nicest camera I have ever owned.  I am an casual photographer with enough background to know where to select aperture or shutter priority, yadda yadda.  I do not like exchangeable lenses for three (significant) reasons: (1) changing a lens lets dust into the sensor ... and this will happen, (2) changing lenses is time consuming and causes you to miss shots and annoy subjects, and (3) extra lenses usually don't give you any capabilities that you can't get with editing. On the last point, note that this camera even has an internal 'fish-eye' effect.  You can get 'multiplier' lenses that attach to this camera, but they are a gimmick and best ignored.  For what I do, I find the 5x zoom is fine; any more would probably create image stabilization problems.  Canon has the best image stabilization of any of the major camera brands -- it just works.  It is fun to play around with the camera by shaking it and taking a picture to see if you can 'defeat' the stabilization.  It's amazing how often it corrects for even the nastiest of shaking.The pictures are first rate; color balance, resolution, exposure all perfect 98% of the time.  Low light sensitivity is great, and image stabilization gives you great evening shots.  The G12 uses big chunky dials to select functions (as opposed to finicky touchscreens on many point and shoot cams).  The case seems to be metal, with a rough surface, and shape that makes the camera very easy to hold.  The vari-angle LCD is very useful (I think Canon made a mistake in not carrying this capability over to their upgrade, the G15)... I use it for crowd shots, walking, etc.  The macro is impressive, allowing me to get pictures less than an inch away from a subject.Overall, the build feels very solid; much more so that other P&S; cameras.  Other reviews seem to indicate that reliability is good.The flash is adequate, but I purchased an inexpensive Bower SFD728C TTL Autofocus Flash for Canon E-TTL II which links into the G12's electronics.  It delivers about 4x the light, and allows bounces, which is really useful even if you are not a professional.  I don't use it all the time (it's as big as the G12) but comes in handy for party shots, and other indoor shooting.  One reviewer stated that this flash is not controllable from the Canon menues; but in the case of the G12, the flash intensity is directly controllable from the G12 menues, so the reviewer may just have missed this.Update 12-16-2012:  I have had a month to learn virtually all of the settings on the G12 and also get a feel for their utility in actual use.  I am impressed with how cleverly Canon's engineers have thought through the UI and ergonomics of the G12.  This is a digital camera, so f-stop, exposure, ISO, etc. don't map precisely into their equivalents on a film camera.  But Canon provides controls for these in a format that makes the G12 feel very natural.  All of the buttons and dials are logically placed, and useful; the menu system gets things done with a minimum of clicking and searching.  I've had a chance to look at the G15 and G1X since I purchased this, and even though these beat the G12 in pixels, they are not as logical in their UI and ergonomics.  I think this sadly may be because Canon listened to reviewers and customers - particularly those who wanted a more video oriented camera.  The loss of the articulating screen on the G15 substantially lowers utility (IMHO), and the larger sensor on the G1X makes the lens and cover a bit clumsier.  The latter two are still great cameras, but for my taste, the less expensive G12 beats them both.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best point and shoot camera with a twist", "Author": "Dlerda", "ReviewID": "R2J94G4RYM0FC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best point and shoot camera ever.

So I had certain key criteria, in no particular order: (1) size (but not too small)and weight, (2) picture quality, (3) ergonomics, (4) folding lcd screen, (5) viewfinder, and (6)ability to use in semi-automatic modes, but fully usable as a point and click.One at a time...the weight of the g12 is fine (quite light), and the size / ergonomics are excellent.  It is easy to hold, the grips and controls are all logically placed.  My wife definitely likes the size and feel of this camera.  So far I've taken only a limited number of pictures, but all seem clear and sharp with crisp colors.  I haven't explored all the shooting options yet, so it will take awhile before I'm completely comfortable with its flexibility.  The folding lcd screen is critically important to me--I take closeup photos for eBay and this camera will be often mounted on a tripod extension arm (inside a \"light-box\").  Positioning the lcd screen so I don't need to do contortions is key(I'm replacing a beloved G1 camera that served me for many years).  The viewfinder, although not perfect is also important when taking photos in full sun (however, the lcd screen does seem quite bright).The only negative so far is the documentation.  Most features are well explained, but some like DR Correction and ISO Rate of Change are not described very well at all.  I don't mind the pdf format since I can read the manual on my ipad.  Also the documentation could use some examples e.g., provide a few useful camera settings and combinations when using C1 or C2.  I can probably find this by searching on-line, but more of a tutorial approach would be appreciated.Update (Oct 1, 2012):  I've returned after 2 weeks on vacation in Europe.  The camera performed extremely well.  Many of the outdoor shots were spectacular -- crisp image, vivid colors, etc.  I took many pictures of poorly lit interiors where flash was not allowed.  Using the low light setting (the one with the candle icon), I was able to take decent pictures with good color and acceptable sharpness.  Yes, some of the pictures were a little grainy, but given the ease of use, these pictures were more than acceptable.  I highly recommend this camera.  Seeing the number of tourists toting heavy DSLRs around their necks confirmed this choice as an excellent travel camera.

It is unfortunately only a 10mp sensor and only a 5X Optical Zoom lens with the ability to extend the range using the Digital Zoom feature.

The swivel / rotating LCD is nice and can be convenient but I will give the warning to be careful in using this feature as you can easily damage / break the connection of the LCD to the camera body.  So, be careful.  Camera comes with one battery and all good digital camera users should have at minimum more than two batteries.  I found that it was difficult to obtain an original Canon battery for the G12 as it appeared most reliable internet vendors were out of stock less than a month ago (06/2012) but finally Amazon.com had a few and was able to purchase one from them at about half the retail price.

The ability to fit filters and external flash units is another plus missing from most smaller cameras. I strongly recommend getting a Canon filter adapter and a 58mm circular polarizer filter (CPL), to naturally enhance color saturation while reducing haze and reflections.As for bags, I wanted one that could fit all these accessories, including an extra battery, battery charger, cable and extra memory cards.

I like this Canon G12 camera, and it does everything you could want, but the quality difference between this camera and one of the larger sensor SLR or mirrorless cameras is evident. The first thing I wanted to do with this camera was to take some HDR photos which is possible because it has useful built-in bracketing. Unfortunately, I found that doing HDR is useless unless the lens is set to \"wide.\" If you zoom into something, the dynamic range goes way down. I could see this in my HDR software. This is probably caused by the all-in-one design of the camera- the extra light from the lens elements are probably lighting up the sensor inside the camera and this can't be fixed later in software. The built-in HDR mode is pretty useless (besides the previously mentioned dynamic range problem) because the camera is slow to take several photos and the HDR mode does not do any image alignment so it is nearly impossible to get a good HDR photo that does not have artifacts in it from movement of the camera or the environment between the shots. I dunno. I was conflicted because this camera was a gift and it is a really great deal for the price and it has many features that prosumer cameras don't all have such as exposure bracketing to 3 ev and saving to raw and HDR, but I realized that I needed to be able to get better lenses and a better sensor to take the photos I want to take so I got the Sony A55 and some lenses and ended up spending a lot more $$$$.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful images and lots more", "Author": "J.

I used to do a lot of photography when I was younger, but with young kids of my own I wanted an above average point and shoot camera. I didn't want to haul a bunch of equipment around but wanted to get some great pics of my kids.I started to question my purchase immediately. In average light conditions, this camera's picture quality is terrible. It also doesn't keep up with my young kids and almost every single picture has significant blurriness and motion artifact. These problems have never been an issue for me before with any camera I have ever used whether a point and shoot or professional camera. What I should have done is return the camera, but I hung in there because of so many positive reviews. I sent it for a week with a friend of mine that is a professional photographer and worked with her, but my picture quality still did not improve.Then, about 2 weeks ago we went to a parade. I pulled out my camera and the screen went black. I could turn it on and off and see the icons. I can promise you that this camera has never been dropped or mis-handled. It is always in the case when not in use. Of course, this happened within a few months of the warranty expiring.I called and talked to Canon and they were great on the phone. Recommended that I send the camera in with a letter explaining my dissatisfaction with this camera. The customer service rep said that they would take a look at the camera, give me an estimate on how much it would cost to fix, and I could decide how to proceed. At this point, I just really felt like this camera was a lemon and that after getting it fixed I could maybe be as happy as the other reviewers. The customer service rep was great on the phone and very helpful so we paid the 15 bucks to mail in the camera.After sending in the camera, we find out that Canon won't even look at your camera until you have pre-paid their estimate to fix the camera based on what your concern is. So, let's be clear here .... they read my letter of concern and quoted me a cost of $130 to fix it, without ever opening or examining the camera itself. I once again called Canon. Their customer service representative apologized for the miscommunication with our previuos call and offered to send the camera back to us, unfixed, for free.Cost for the camera ... $500Cost to mail in the dud of a camera to be fixed ... $15Cost in missed photo opportunities ... PricelessI doubt that we will ever buy another Canon product again. I admit, this camera has glowing reviews. My advice to you is that if you buy this camera and have any doubts, return it immediately.

Srivastava", "ReviewID": "R25A0TIVPFGREX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the G12 in 2010 after buying into all the positive comments about the specs and build quality.Build quality is excellent and I havent seen any other like it so far.But the reason for my 2 star rating is this: extremely slow from shot to shot, auto-focus also slower than several cheaper P&S; cams. So if you have kids or pets and want to get creative using the PASM modes, forget it. Even auto mode is slow for me. Have to use flash to capture fast moving subjects which ruins the entire photo sometimes. Although, I have managed to get some very nice prints when using HDR or a tripod or of still subjects. But if this is going to be your DSLR alternative for family/friends occasions, i see a problem in its overall slowness.One more thing, the lens is so so. I would expect a faster lens for a $500 camera, maybe a F1.8 if not faster. Unfortunately, Canon used similar optics for their G1X. If i was a camera maker, I would focus on getting an extremely fast lens (F1.2), a largish sensor (the 1.5 inch from G1x or APSC a la SOny nex 5n) and add all dials like the G12 on it. And then I would forget about replacement models every other year which give some take some.I sold off my G12 in 2012 and bought a Nikon P300 for about half the price of G12 (got it for $225 after using some credits on Amazon). ANd what a camera it is. I could never think of using a Nikon coolpix for anything as I thought they just make good DSLRs. But i was wrong. The P300 has all PSAM modes, a F1.8 lens at widest setting and a 921k dot 3 inch display. It is extremely fast as compared to G12, it takes excellent low light pictures and can fit in my pocket easily. Does 1080P video too which was another problem with the G12. The video fron G12 is horrible.Recommend all to look at the P300 (now P310) before finalizing.I hope G13 or G2X fixes the lens specs.

I have used the Auto mode for the general vacation photos but also used the manual mode for more dramatic photos at night.

The SD450 almost always takes excellent pictures outdoors, but has very little you can change to control the picture the camera takes. For example, when indoors, with the camera set to auto, sometimes it will take good pictures and sometimes it won't. In an area with fluorescent lighting the pictures have a distinctly different color tone, and there is basically no way to do anything to change that until after you import the pictures and try to touch them up with photo editing software. The SD450 is great if you just want to put it in your pocket in case you happen to see something you want to take a picture of, because it is very small. I wanted the G12 to take better quality pictures of friends and family, especially at family functions like reunions and holiday gatherings. The G12 also has a better lense and more zoom. It is listed as having 5X Optical Zoom, and the camera actually has the capacity to zoom in to 10X with (I presume) an interpolated zoom for the 6x to 10X portion. I was especially interested in this camera's ability to take pictures in RAW format and the ability to take 720 HD video. When I import the original pictures, I save them in a folder I name with the date or other identifier and the word  \"Originals\" and at the same time make another folder with the same first name and \"Reduced\" to put the modified pictures into. This way, if I happen to delete or ruin a picture accidentally while trying to improve it, I can always restore a copy from the original file and start over. I then use the excellent photo program that is included to reduce the size of a copy of all the pictures I decide to keep.  (I was expecting yet another copy of the latest version of Adobe Photoshop Elements, but this camera comes with a much better Photo software package.) The SD450 seems to take a lot of pictures that have red eye, but so far I have not had that problem with the G12. This camera takes excellent pictures just by leaving it on full automatic. I am still learning how to use this camera, but so far, with just the auto settings I am very happy with the picture quality. The software has an excellent batch processing ability where you can select the pictures you want to change and it processes them all at once very quickly. This is very helpful if you send pictures to friends and family by e-mail. Canon also provides online storage of the pictures if you want, so you can just send people a invitation to the web site and they can go to the site by invitation only and look at, print or save any pictures they want.So far I am very impressed with the battery life. I charged it fully upon arrival and have used the camera several times, once almost all day and have not had to recharge the battery even once. It is getting low and I will fully charge it again after discharging it fully.Finally, I would like to say that Amazon was very helpful in getting the camera to me very quickly. I wanted to use it at an family reunion, but I actually waited too long to place the order. Somehow Amazon came through and I got the camera the day before the reunion.

It is more compatible with existing manufacturing technology.Thus the G12 with its Sony CCD sensor may be a classic design that will never be superseded.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Jaree Cassie", "ReviewID": "R27HEKFSN9RP2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera came as described; takes beautiful pictures and is very remarkable for its size.

The CHDK hack ups the setting range and unlocks the be all end all for this camera. It looks good and has that old school boxy heavy feel.

Most photos will look better on the computer. The LCD is great for over head shooting at concerts and crowds and also for low angles. It is a really nice camera to transition to a DSLR. Overall it does what it does well, it is not the camera to print poster size prints from. The camera is also not great for shooting any then moving super fast unless in the best lighting conditions. It is a great begging camera that you will want to use and have with you all the time. The coolest thing is all the stuff you can put on it underwater housing, flashes, ring lights, telephoto lens, fish eye, pretty much anything you want or could need.I does one think that some people will love which is get up close and personal with the subject well.

It's loaded with features and solidly built and takes really good pictures.  I have a couple other cameras in this category of enthusiast cameras and the G12 holds its own with both of them.  With one exception.  The LX5 takes macro shots better.  It's clear with multiple shots both my wife and I agree the LX5 is the macro winner.  It could be the processor with this generation-the Digic 4 and 5, smooth details out.  My wife wanted a HS 320 Canon and we returned it for this reason.  She pointed this out and she takes better photos than me.  But sitting in the cheap seats in a baseball stadium, the G12 can take a tiny pic of homeplate and it blows up cleanly and this is where it beat the LX5 considerably.  I also have an XZ-1.  I like this camera but it is a beat behind both the LX5 and the G12, but it is one handsome camera and is fast.The biggest issue I have with the G12 is just that--It's the biggest.  It's as thick as a brick.  It's heavy and has an industrial feel to it.  The whole premise for this type of camera is that it feels smaller than a DSLR but should be easier to carry around.  There's not much difference between carrying around my beautiful Canon 20d with the smallish 50 mm lens and this G12.  I know there is a G15 out now that addresses this somewhat, but the G12 is what it is.I find myself grabbing the LX5 because the slick metal body and profile makes it easier to slide into your pants pocket.  While in theory an articulating fold out screen is useful I don't find it all that big of an advantage.  And while I'm not thrilled with putting an LVF on the LX5 when I need it, it is still preferable to the viewfinder on the G12, that has a bulging lens visible when you look through it and not really representative of what you are viewing.So in essence I like this camera but compared to others in its category, I think I prefer something else.

The diopter setting doesn't go anywhere high enough for my lousey eyes like my other camera did.It is nice to have a lot of manual controls on the camera instead of in a fussy computer menu. The revolving wheel is very easy to mess up tho. It would be nice if the ring was a little wider to make your choice more certain. I tend to hit the flash button, for example, when trying to move right.The reason I switched to this Canon model was that I wanted something less bulky; more portable on outdoor adventures. It is a little heavy and bulkier than compacts. But, I knew that. This is exactly what I expected. It will serve this purpose well.I'm still learning to use this camera. I ended up buying the Magic Lantern guide for the G12. I like to have it with me and the G12 User manual is not available in print.

And, of course waterproof to at least 100 feet without the need for external housing and so forth and so forth.

And for those who say G12 is not much of an improvement over G11, look again. My G12 performs better and faster than my G11 with a few new features, besides taking super sharp photos, that have proven extremely practical in my everyday shooting, like horizontal level indicator which no one talks about and comes in quite handy when using the LCD in swivel mode, and yes I've had great success in low light shooting as well.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "non-functioning after one year", "Author": "lkv56", "ReviewID": "R3KXPHL2Z3I7DX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at the end of 2010 and a year and a half later it is non functioning.

I have been becoming more interested in photography over the past couple of years and was looking for a good enthusiast camera to learn off of. I had done extensive research before purchasing and could not be happier with the g12.When researching i quickly ruled our mirrorless cameras or dslrs as I did not feel as if I knew enough to invest in a system yet. I also wanted something relatively compact that I can take on vacations.  That narrowed my choices down to the g12, the nikon p7100 or the canon s100.I decided on the g12 because:1) it has much longer battery life than the more compact s100. I thought this extremely important when out on vacation as I have heard how quickly the s100 drained the battery. The g12 is a bigger camera, but not if you need 4 extra batteries to make it through the day.2) it has a hotshoe vs the s100.3) the g12 seemed to have slightly better reviews than the p7100 and I believe the g series has been around much longer than nikons so it was a more developed camera with less bugsAfter I bought it the g 1x was released, but I still feel that I  am glad I have the g12 because it seems that it is more rounded it its abilities ( ie macro) and also hundreds of dollars cheaper. I bought a g12, a canon speedlight e270ii, gorillapod  and a lowe pro bag and still had 200+ dollars left over.The g12 has virtually every control that a dslr has in a relatively compact body.

Picture quality also depends on your memory card so please read up on that as well.Now, this might sound trivial to all the professional photographers in here, but this little surprise really cinched this deal for me. The G12 has the fish-eye option *throws confetti in the air*. I really love this particular effect, especially when used in landscape shots, so when I saw it on the G12, I laughed my little heart out.

Several people commented that this is a tough, solid, dependable camera, and I wanted something built better than our Nikon S8100, which had lens error after six months and had to be sent back to Nikon for warranty repair, but that is another story.I'm not a Canon \"fanboy\" - we had only Nikons and Canons in the last 30 years and I like them equally.The G12 has been praised here like few others, and I won't repeat what the reviewers stated so well, because they are all right. But I'd like to add something which has been left out, and this is the main reason I'd rather use the G12  than our DSLR.The 16:9 aspect ratio.Most new TV sets and monitors have the wide mode or 16:9 aspect ratio or the 1920 x1080 resolution.  What this means is that when I view photos taken by the DSLR on our 27 inch monitor,  I'm only looking at a 23 inch picture.  The rest of the screen is taken up by gray bars on the sides.No big deal, you say.  Just hit the plus key two or three times, and voila, there is  a photo covering the entire screen.That is true, but by now I'm looking at  a different photo, I lost something in the foreground by cropping.For the life of me I can't understand that a $ 99 point of shoot will support 16:9 4:3  3:2 and 1:1 aspect ratios, but a $ 3,000 DSLR does not.  Some of the Sonys do, but I'm not familiar with them.  The Canon D60 and the T3i  support the 16:9 aspect ratio, BUT ONLY WHILE USING LIVE VIEW.  Live view is using the screen, and I much prefer the clarity and ease of composing on the optical viewfinder.The G12 supports 16:9, and it doesn't matter if I'm using the viewfinder or the screen.If anyone else gets frustrated by this, please, I'd love to hear your comments.

Obviously you have to know what your doing, but I have used the g9, g10-11 and now 12 for weddings and I have sold prints from all of the g series bodies, but with the lowering of the pixels and larger sensors of g11 and g 12, the g12 can perform as well as my 2500$ d700 and 5d mk ii bodies. This camera is incredible and for the price, its a professional backup and the best camera you can purchase for the price. Shooting in raw, adding 720p 24fps video and lowering pixels from 14.7 to 10mp was a huge plus. It's not always about mega pixels, take the NIKON d700 full frame 12mp is far superior than my Canon 7d at 18mp.....and sometimes better than my 22mp Canon 5d mk ii. The canon g12 has professional features, great image quality, amazing video quality and is just an overall compact incredible camera that can be used for just about anything you can think of. Seriously if have rated this camera 1 star and are complaining about the new hdr, video and screen size additions, you are a moron and clearly have no idea what you are talking about and probably couldn't take a decent photograph with a freaking NIKON d3x. I can't stand when people just give bad reviews for no reason or because they are terrible photographers or because they can't use the camera and blame they blame it for their mistakes. The Canon g12 is an excellent camera and you may not need it over the g11, but the new features and the price are well worth an upgrade or first time purchase. I would recommend this camera to anyone and do not listen to the bad reviews. Those people have no idea what they are talking about, yes the hdr feature is a gimmick, for bracketing does the same thing and using photomatix, etc....but its still a cool feature for noobs and the 720 p video is very good for the price and the ISO range, color, and lens is pro comparable if used correctly. The best feature in the g series is the hotshoe that does alloy for a pro flash like a 580ex ii to make it a great back up camera for weddings or fashion shoots.

Good for taking pictures holding the camera at arms length over your head.Really like being able to go into the two manual modes and manual focus.  My Elfs won't do that. Takes nice night time pictures.Battery seems to last forever during normal operation.  Takes hundreds of pictures between chargings.Minuses:It's very difficult to pick up without pushing a button.  There are buttons on every surface.  One has to spend time figuring out which button got inadvertently pushed.Won't optical zoom while taking movies.  This is a huge drawback.  Yes, it will digital zoom, but digital zoom is not desireable for many reasons.Will not turn itself off while connected to the computer.  Instead, it runs the battery down.  It's very easy to forget that it's on after downloading pictures and working with them.  Come back a few hours later and you have a dead battery.Battery does not charge when plugged into the computer (like my GPSs).

I love the articulated screen, the ISO nob instead of function key, and many other great features.My personal review for people with similar situations as I had.This is definitely a point & shoot, more-so in feel than in quality of pictures; it takes great quality pictures actually.I got this camera to replace my t3i because I didn't feel like I was using it enough and wanted something to always have with me. Well, I ended up taking it back and sticking with my t3i, here's why:Accessibility: For me personally, I was looking for something that I could have at the ready any moment, and I just wasn't comfortable throwing this in my purse without a case. I purchased a little case that fits in my purse, but then I have to take the case out of my purse, take the camera out of the case, turn it on, make sure I'm in the correct mode (M, AV, TV), and then adjust my settings accordingly. It just wasn't any faster than if I had my t3i with me, in fact in some ways slower. I usually just ended up taking out my iPhone and shooting a pic instead of using the G12.View finder: It sucks, plain and simple. Yes, I understand this is a point & shoot, but in my personal opinion the view finder is basically useless, I literally never used it.Interface: Honestly, it seemed harder to maneuver than my t3i. The menu system is a little different than my t3i, which is OK, I don't expect it to be identical, just not my favorite.I hope this helps people who are camera shopping!", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast shipping", "Author": "Mandy", "ReviewID": "R2SK9G4H6O7W1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast shipping.

I own a couple Canon DSLR cameras including the 5D Mark II and an assortment of L-series lenses. I love my 5D. I'm used to it's tack sharp images with nice contrast and color. This is not what I'm getting with the G12. I realize this is like comparing apples to oranges but only mention it to establish the fact that I know good image quality when I see it. The G12 images are okay but definately not as sharp as I'm used to. Also the images are very noisey especially at 400 ISO and higher. Additionaly, the camera's light meter is good but not great. It tends to over expose quite often. I do think the easy access manual controls, fully articulating back screen, optical viewfinder, relatively small size and ability to shoot RAW images is great and are the reasons why I purchased the camera. The camera is feature rich for it's size. However, it suffers where it matters the most - image quality. I have not viewed the video on my computer or t.v. so can not comment on the quality. I can say that the video I took did look good on the camera's small screen. To be fair, I have to admit, I am very picky when it comes to image quality.

For many years I had a film SLR and was an enthustiast but gave up my SLR many years ago as my interest waned and had been using a nice Sony compact digital for the last few years.I quickly flicked through the Busch book and grasped the basics of the controls and left for India with just a basic knowledge. I therefore left the camera on auto because everything happens so fast there and there's no time to fiddle and adjust. When I did have time I was able to find the necessary adjustment button quite quickly and the results were everything I could have asked for.I have just returned and had the first opportunity to review the photos on my TV.I must say that I am in awe of this camera. The colours are superb and brought out all the richness of Indian colours and that is with std AWB and without the vivid colour feature.The video was outstanding in my opinion within its limits (no zooming or focus adjusting while filming) but it didn't effect the overall result.The photos look very sharp and as good as a SLR when played on the TV or computer.Low light pictures were again very good and of course there's going to be some grain but it didn't spoilt the photo and we're talking about really low light stuff here.There are many more features I have to learn to bring out the best in the camera and many hundreds of hours of reading as well. But you can be safe in the knowledge that while you are learning you can leave it to the camera and it won't let you down.There's only one caveat and that is I wish it had a slightly longer zoom. There were times I could have done with something a bit longer.

Now start to work with some lower light and here is where it's flaws shine.When taking video in low light with I would get blue lines on the screen, this was ok except the record on the movie. I called Canon and they could not repro the problem. So I took the camera and exchanged it, the second one I got did the exact same thing. Blue lines from top to bottom. I search the internet to find out if anyone else was having the problem. It's called vertical smear and is a problem with CCD sensors. however you can make the problem go away by turning down the exposure. Now only if the G12 would allow you to do that, then you could solve the problem, video mode is Auto only.Next problem, is you can not write to RAW in Auto modeI wanted to use the camera and work with studio flash, I set the camera to M, turn off the built in flash, set the shutter speed to 1/200 and f8 so far so good, put the pocket wizard on to trigger my strobes press the shutter and the screen goes black. So I am thinking it is a problem with the pocket wizard. It is a problem in that the LCD shows a preview of what the photo will look like, since the photo is too dark without a flash, the screen goes black, so now you can't see what you are focusing on.I thought the camera was targeted towards pros. So why Auto only video mode? What can't you preview with a an external flash, why no raw in auto? Hopefully firmware will resolve some of these issues in the meantime, I returned the second one and will wait for an update.

For the stills, though havent tried all the settings, I am very satisfied. Also find fault with the viewfinder.Here are my reasons:When shooting a movie and using the zoom feature the camera's audio picks up whirring and clicking sounds (from the motor). Also the zoom(while in movie mode) is digital zoom not optical and the user has no control over this.When I noticed this I called Canon and was told that this was 'not acceptable\" and the camera I had was faulty. So I exchanged for another one.The other camera (still a G12) arrived and it exhibited the same noise problem. Called Canon again and after speaking to several reps finally was reffered to page 30 of the users manual.To quote: \"Pressing the zoom lever will zoom in on the subject. However,operation sounds will be recorded and the movie may appear coarse\"Translation: You'll get whirring and clicking sounds in your audio and the camera records at digital zoom.True I could go in and delete the audio portion of the video but if I had recorded other sounds this would be a daunting task.As for the viewfinder: It does not display any settings but they are displayed in the LCD. Thus if one wants to use the viewfinder and adjust or check settings, one has to constantly move the camera from the viewfinder to the LCD,etc. In effect why bother having a viewfinder?Another gripe I have is Canon not including a printed user manual and their lame excuse about 'green movement.' I guess all the Canon executives carry around an 8x10 manual at a couple pounds. Or perhaps they have memorized it? Shame on you Canon, if you want to save money cut some of the useless 'features.'So, if you can live with the above, I still think it takes great pictures.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is what not advertised about Canon G12 Powershot.", "Author": "Lev Goncharov", "ReviewID": "R3A11F4O2581CZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It shoots RAW, but Canon software is not user-friendly. Adobe requires you to download several separate pieces of software (installer, manager, plug-in, converter, patch etc), neither one of which seems to work, and they take enormous amount of space on your hard drive.

If you know a software engineer, who can spend several hours making this work, give it a try! After spending my entire Christmas I get an 'Error Loading Updater Workflow' message!I was looking for a pocket pro-grade compact camera when outside studio. Aiptek was my previous ultimate shooter, but I am looking for higher quality in photo and video production value for my reference field shots and video, while on the go. I work with Creo back, Hasselblad, Canon 5Ds, and other equipment.I have tried the Canon G12. This could be a great camera. Although it has one big issue! It will not change focus in the video mode while recording, and this is a big problem. To change the focus, you have to stop recording, refocus, and start shooting again. Although, there is a \"firmware update\" by the third party of \"enthusiasts\", basically a hack, which supposed to fix that issue. But there are so many different versions, depending on the camera's firmware, so you have to be nearly a programmer to figure this out, as mentioned.Not sure if G12, without capability to change focus while shooting, is a great near-professional pocket camera. There is also no jack for external mic on the G12 either. So it needs a separate portable audio recorder. G12 has no option for using an audio mixer, since there is no audio jack.The 5x zoom is really not needed there at all. It is inconvenient for fast shooting because it is requiring 2- or 3-step compensation in exposure/shutter speed (or ISO) to get consistently exposed shots (unless in Auto ISO mode, which may give high grain the higher ISO readings). Besides the zoom mechanism may be a problem, since it has moving parts. It would be better to have just an accessory kit (which is an option anyway with this camera) with wide angle and telephoto, while the camera would not have the optical zoom at all. The zoom makes it harder to carry in the pocket.I am still looking, and not even sure if there is such a camera on the market, like a little Aiptek.Besides, the camera will not charge the battery through the USB connection, so you have to carry external charger. The camera will allow to download files from the card while connected to a PC computer, but will not allow to upload. There is always a need for external card reader. Camera will not work with Mac Pro, and provided by Canon Mac software has additional issues. Theses are minor things I could live with. This is about the best point and shoot camera, if some of the issues could be addressed and worked out.
