Takes crisp, clear, sharp pictures. (Although having a good picture editing program helps too.) Video quality not the best but good for the price. Excellent camera overall.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Uphelace \"Uphelace\"", "ReviewID": "R20RB6OR4YV0MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great digital camera for people who are not very \"camera saavy\".  My husband and I were on vacation with our old digital camera and we found we would spend 5 minutes \"teaching\" people how to use our camera before they could take a picture for us.  This camera is a very simple point and shoot, and the photos are better quality than my older camera (that cost 5 x time this much).  It can also take videos which are not the greatest, but better than not having the feature at all.  I bought one of these for my parents (who are older and absolutely not a part of the digital generation), and they love it as well.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "J.

I deleted that review and gave the dealer some time to make good on his promise and even offered a cheaper alternative. Today he told me he's not going to complete his end. Now he is sending me argumentative messages. Be wary dealing with this guy.(some unedited email quotes from the emails the dealer wrote me (15 emails today!))if your nice and change your bad feedback i will refund you half what u paid for your hassles getting cord and cd thanks so much i would greatly appreciate this RickThere is no Way I can pay you to take my merchandise I would go out of business Inever made no such promise sorry can't do thatIn 25 years and business your most demanding I have ever encountered maybe u need to learn to read what your buying clearly stated wasn't new and now u expect that your a jokeremember this ? was after i said i would have refunded you key word would have. not one time here did u ask for anything, you decided to remove feedback anyway remember i sure do now all of a sudden 3 weeks later u want money from me lol lol lol your to funny this will be my last email as i see i will never make a unhappy miserable person like you happy so im done wasting my time on you bye bye enjoy your life", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP photosmart camera", "Author": "W.

I purchased this camera to send with my husband for his deployment to Afghanistan. It's perfect because I can just send him batteries and a memory card to stick in it. He isn't worried about settings or other functions, he loves how simple it is to use - Just click the button and there's the picture! He has some great photos with this camera.
