{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value, Awesome Kit", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3IOA2ANPCPA00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This kit had everything I needed to start off in my first year of film school. The tripod isn't the best quality, but it does its job. Overall though this is an excellent deal, and saves you a lot of money. I got everything I needed to film, and do photography. The kit was very well packaged, so that none of the items came damaged. Also the lenses are of a decent quality, and are more than adequate for everything I need to do. If you need a camera and all the accessories, this is definitely the way to go. The 32G memory card is also a huge plus! As a film student, I know that the standard 8G fills up quickly when doing video. So 32G was excellent.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "beautifully thought-out kit with case and accessories", "Author": "V. Martindale", "ReviewID": "R353TT5L9O993M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter who is majoring in film editing and directing.  She used it to film footage for her senior project.  She also used it for some still photography.  The complete kit is very well thought out, with cases and containers for all the parts.  She had no trouble managing the lenses and filters, and keeping one battery charging while using the other.  She won't be able to rate the quality of the capture until she starts editing.  One nuisance during filming was that part of the screen is covered by information, obscuring the view.  Some footage had to be recreated because there was a mirror reflecting passers-by, and in another case the cameraman was reflected.The sensitivity and range with respect to lighting conditions is great.  When I have more info on how the footage looked during editing, I all post.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera Bundle Review", "Author": "Niyi Maraiyesa", "ReviewID": "R3BPTZ210LR4P8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Some of the accessories with bundle not working e.g 32GB SD card could not be formatted and would not work, had to buy another card before camera could be used", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Good", "Author": "Babak \"Babak\"", "ReviewID": "R78N2NS62K9AX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1- The Camera is Canon 70D, which is very good and the camera with 18-55 lens is being sold at $1140 in most of the websites.2- The 75-300 lens is also canon but NOT STM! the price is about $1903- I tried one of the batteries, it worked almost 200 shots mixed with flash or without flash. $23.994- I haven't tried the external charger but its price is around $105- 32GB DANE-ELEC memory seems to be really class 10 and it is about $146- 0.43X Wide angle Lens totally useless!

The 75-300mm lens even though not top of the line does a great job and the 18-55mm lens is a good everyday lens.  I wish the package included an 18-135mm stm lens.  I had to order that by itself.  The extra batteries and chargers were a good added feature as were the filters. The macro close up kit is a good addition as well.  The wide angle lens and the 2x telephoto lens do not seem to work well but I need to experiment with them more. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this package. Plan on ordering a different case, the one that comes with it is small.  I would recommend Amazons DSLR Backpack.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly what it is", "Author": "Lisa Cupp", "ReviewID": "R12HMYGZ88PRPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was great the parts that are important were canon (both main lenses) the wide and tele lens work perfect", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP", "Author": "Ashroff Deen", "ReviewID": "R1GF8X699VSFVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great service Great value the items were spot on.

I am not a technical camera aficionado so I will not speak in those terms and I am still learning about it.  I purchased this camera to take pictures of my sons' lacrosse teams.
