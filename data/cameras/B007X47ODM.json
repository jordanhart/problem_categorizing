This deal was one of the factors that made me buy this one. Everything is good quality and the camera feels great. I was a little used to my mother's D90 so this one feels smalle, lighter and just using it takes some getting used to. I live in Puerto Rico and everything came in one box and surprisingly 2 days earlier than supposed. Could not be happier. From now on Cameta Camera will be on my top list", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for beginners", "Author": "ST", "ReviewID": "RVOA1OHQ43N22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was thinking of making a switch from the point and shoot camera to a SLR, and this camera proved to be a perfect fit for this transition....I could easily see the huge difference in picture quality while not worrying too much about details of photography.....the camera has a variety of advanced features for those more interested in advanced levels....", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my new Nikon!", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R224N7I7FT39L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this camera and package!
