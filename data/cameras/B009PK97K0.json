{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lots of features, decent price point, a little large and flimsy feeling", "Author": "Richard C. Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...", "ReviewID": "RKP5N3RV8WGL0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First impression - this camera seems light and flimsy. It's entirely made of plastic (except the lens), and I'm sure a drop from a few feet would wreck it. But that's true of most cameras in this price range. It also seems too large when compared to other point and shoots. But after looking at the features, it becomes obvious why it's so large - there's a pop-up flash and a hot-shoe for an external flash. The lens is also quite a bit larger than your run of the mill point and shoot - both in volume of glass and length.The 3\" screen is large - the same size as many DSLR's. You can switch between the screen and viewfinder by pressing a button. The viewfinder uses less power, and honestly, has a cheesy look. The screen is much clearer and easier to use. The viewfinder is nice in bright light.The lens can be zoomed from two places - a control on the left side of the lens, and the control the shutter release sits in.  That's handy. My main complaint with the zoom is using it with video - the zoom is not smooth, and stutters.  It also stops at around 3x - not the full 30x. Why?Speaking of video, it's decent quality and saves in AVI format.Other features include an advanced panoramic mode - shoot one image, and move left to right - when a visual guide lines up (X over X) the next photo automatically shoots. Nice. But the saved image is no larger than a single image! It can stitch three full size images - the result should be at least 2x the normal image size.  But the pano quality is much better than most other pocket camera panoramic modes - although it is limited to horizontal panoramics.When zooming into the image 100%, the pixels are decently clean. Not DSLR quality, but above average. I have nice Panasonic, Canon and Nikon pocket cameras - the pixel quality on the Fuji are superior.The combination of the super-zoom, wide angle and macro is also a big plus.The SL300 also has full auto mode, plus several more advanced modes (Aperture priority, automatic program, shutter priority, custom, smile detect) and full manual. The full manual is limited though - only two F stops - these vary on conditions.  The maximum exposure length is 8 seconds - rare in a camera of this price range.Focusing is in a word, hinky. Zoomed in, 25x-30x, it takes forever and often fails. Even with high-contrast subjects.  The anti-vibration is not as good as some other cameras.  I see more blur than I like at full zoom when hand-held. Placing the camera against a solid surface fixed this.There are also \"dummy proof\" measures - you are warned when there's no memory card or the lens cap in on.The camera does use a custom battery, but it includes an external charger - that's a great feature. The cable that us used for USB and component/RCA audio and video is a proprietary mish-mash. A small connector at one end plugs into the camera. The other end has a standard USB connector, plus two RCA fittings. Strange.If you're looking for a beginner camera with some advanced features, I'd recommend this camera. For example, you want to experiment with panoramas, long exposures and lighting.  If all you want is a point and shoot, you can find cheaper - and much smaller cameras.  But for quality glass, lens zoom, this can't be beat in this price range.So I give it three stars.  Some great points (lens, zoom, image quality, hot-shoe, pop-up flash, high speed and burst modes) and some misses (focus issues, all plastic body, long processing time between images.) Would I recommend it? Yes, to someone looking for a camera to learn on, and develop their skills.  For someone looking for a simple point and shoot? No.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for my budget", "Author": "Bruce", "ReviewID": "R3AR27FDVXCM9I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I am not a professional photographer, nor do I expect professional photos from this camera.  I am an artist however. One reason in which I needed a camera is for occasional reference photos in which I will make paintings from.  As I do not do photo-realism, great photos with perfect detail retention are not necessary for this purpose.  The 24 mm wide angle of the lens is nice when I need a photo of the bigger picture.  And the panorama feature provides an even wider view...at an extremely easy to use method.  It practically does it for you if you keep it set on auto panorama.  And the 30x zoom is wonderful to bring distant objects closer.  Like I said, they only are required to be used as a reference, so the quality doesn't need to be great.  The \"dual image stabilization\" feature is a bit of a farce.  \"Dual\" means sensor shift, coupled with high ISO, so that the shutter speed can be faster, thus less blur.  So with the high ISO, it produces quite grainy pictures.  It would be nicer if the camera had the option to separate the \"dual\" into \"just sensor shift,\" \"just high ISO,\" or \"both,\" so that you wouldn't be forced to get a grainy picture.  But that is not an option, so I question its effectiveness.The other reason why I needed a camera was to take photos of my artwork.  For this purpose, I set the camera to P \"Programmed Auto\" so I can chose the ISO, and set it to 64 or 100 ISO.  I set the painting in an outdoor courtyard on a bright sunny day...in the shade.  I use a tripod (this camera has a tripod mount) to get it framed just so, and use the 10 second delay to avoid shake when pushing the shutter button.  One problem I had was there was sometimes a bit of pincushion distortion on a few shots.  But at other times it was perfectly square with no such distortion.  So I think that it depends on how much you zoom, for such distortion is apparently avoidable.  I have a large format printer that prints 13 x 19 size paper, and the quality of the prints of my paintings is acceptable after photo editing (cropping etc.) and minor color correcting.  It seemed that emeralds and teals were a bit cool and washed out.  But that may just require me finding the proper settings for white balance and saturation, for which the camera is adjustable.  But photo editing and color correcting is almost always necessary even with a much more expensive camera, so this is not a big deal.  I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 6.0 to manually color correct and crop.  This program also lets you eliminate any pincushion or barrel distortion that such a camera may impart.  So for such a procedure, this camera produces quite  acceptable results...although I do intend to upgrade to a DSLR for this purpose in the distant future.  But for now, this camera suits its intended purposes.There is a product video on Amazon which does outright state some incorrect information.  It says that this camera has manual focus...it does not.  It says it has 60 X intelligent zoom...it does not.  It does have a regular digital zoom however, and it is up to 201 X digital zoom...I just don't recommend using it. The video also says that the camera has a back-side illuminated EXR Cmos sensor...it does not.  It is a CCD sensor.  It also shows that the camera has \"advanced anti-blur mode,\" which takes several pictures at once and merges them together.  This is also not true.  It also claims that you can take 360 degree panorama pictures both side to side and up and down.  It can only do up and down panorama pictures if you hold the camera sideways.  And either way, it is definitely not 360 degrees...maybe 180.  And one huge misleading bit of information that the video shows is that the 3\" LCD screen tilts.  This is also not true, as it is completely fixed.  As I researched for a camera for some time, I already knew that these misleading claims were not true and actually apply to the higher end Fuji models HS25EXR and HS30EXR cameras.  Since I wasn't expecting these features, I wasn't fooled or disappointed.  But for the price, I wasn't expecting everything, even if these features were stated to be on this camera according to the video.So for the price, and for my needs, I believe that this camera does just fine.  If I expected to sell landscape or birding photography, I would be disappointed.  But that is not what I expected or required from this camera.  The pictures of grass and leaves are a bit \"watercolory\" looking (Is that a word?) when looked at closely.  But even those photos will look just fine printed on 8x10 paper.  The lithium ion battery works well and really lasts a pretty long time.  It would be nice if I could put on a UV filter to protect the lens, or a polarizer filter to make skies blue and to adjust reflections...but there is no filter thread.  One part that bugs me is the lens cap...it jams if you turn on the camera and attempt to zoom if you forget to take it off.  But I think I will learn to get used to that.  I looked at other cameras that just had the LCD screen, but I like the fact that this camera can use either the 3\" LCD screed or the electronic viewfinder, for there are times when the viewfinder just works better...such as in bright light.  I will not comment on the video feature, as this is not something that I use or need.  It also has other features that I probably will not use, such as smile and blink detection.  But they are nice features to have if your camera is meant as a Facebook tool.  I also do not like the fact that the full manual is on CD only.  Before I received the camera, I went on the Fuji website and downloaded and printed the manual for this camera so I could read up on it...but I did kind of expect a nice printed book with the camera, but there was just the CD.But for a capable camera at an affordable price, I give this camera four stars.  High ISO pictures are pretty grainy, but low ISO pictures in good light still takes quality pictures of my artwork.  So for what I use it for, and for my budget, I think I made a good choice.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, versatile DSLR-like camera that takes great photos and good video", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R37RMHK7EDPQR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this camera as part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.I have been using a similar camera: Olympus SP-800UZ 14MP Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0 inch LCD for over a year now.  After being disappointed in the Olympus' fuzzy pictures, slow focus, and poor shot quality in low light conditions, the FinePix restored my faith in sub-$300 DSLR-like cameras with its responsiveness, clear shots, and multiple mode options.  Both have video taking capabilities and work 'OK' in my opinion.  (Get a SDHC Class '10' card or better to get the most from video with either camera.)What I like about the Fujifilm FinePix SL300...+ For its size; which is not 'compact', it's very lightweight.+ Shooting, playback and setup options are clearly explained in back of Basic Manual.+ The rubberized texture on much of the camera helps a lot!+ Lithium battery charges quickly; about 1-1.5 hours from dead to full charge.+ Wonderful 'macro'; down to 2cm!+ Panoramic function; putting together 3 shots, works well and produces beautiful results.+ Blink detection works well.+ Colors produced are true.+ Zoom toggle is both on the right top and on the left side of the barrel.+ You have the option to shut off the LCD and use the viewfinder. (Most of the lower end cameras are going to just the LCD.)+ SRAuto mode works well, automatically detecting scenes and adjusting for it.  Modes include: Portrait, Landscape, Night, Macro, Night Portrait, Backlit Portrait and 'Auto' if none of the others are detected.+ You can refine your 'scene' mode with a bunch of options by using the 'SP' mode on the top of the camera.  Scenes available include: Natural (shoots 2 photos; one with flash and one without), Natural Light, Portrait, Baby Mode (portraits of infants; light skin tones), Smile & Shoot(auto shutter release when subject smiles), Landscape, Sport (for any moving subjects), Night, Night Tripod, Fireworks (you can adjust shutter speed), Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party (indoor with background lighting in low light), Flower (vivid closeups), and Text (text or print drawings).+ Zoom indicator is easily visible.+ You can change from color to Black/White photos.+ Camera is quick to go from taking pictures to viewing them, and then back again.+ Automatic facial recognition of up to 8 people in the pictures is ultra cool!+ Menu and buttons are easy to use for novice through advanced users.+ Deleting pictures or 'Frames' is quick and easy.+ Movies are easy to take with fairly good results.+ Zoom bracketing allows you to take 3 shots in a row, and then the camera fuses them into one great shot.  Works well with subjects that are not moving very fast.+ You can shoot with either Aperture Priority or Manual mode.+ Custom mode is available for those who want DSLR refinements.What I didn't like so much about the FinePix...- Lens cover is a 'pinch' to insert in the inside rim of the lens housing, versus over the outside of the rim.  Fits, but if you forget to take it off it jams the lens movement, and over time that may break something.  Try and remember to remove before you turn on the camera!- AC adapter is strange; you actually slide the plug adapter on the back of the charger. Why 2 pieces?!- Battery and memory housing door seems flimsy by comparison to the rest of the camera. Be careful.- The 'Basic Manual' is very basic, but you get it in English, Spanish and French.  Diagrams are very small.- Focusing the camera by depressing the shutter button halfway prior to pressing it all the way down is standard with most digital cameras, but I still find it frustrating.  Practice, practice, practice!- It's movie output is good, but not great. Focus changes take longer than with photos and the lag is noticeable.- Zoom is great on the camera, but if you are shooting at something through trees for example, the camera isn't sure what to focus on and will sometimes focus on the foreground versus infinity. (Not a huge issue and may be my inexperience and impatience more than the camera.)Overall, I really like this camera and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get creative and get great results.I will update this review after I use it in more varied situations, but already it beats the Olympus in responsiveness and output.I recommend getting a Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E and you'll be all set to enjoy this versatile, inexpensive digital camera!", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "SL300 Bridge Camera must have", "Author": "Joncore \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R3T6KBAE6CHWUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera couple months ago and I was surprised to it that the features is awesome.It is easy to use and users friendly. It has 14 MP, EVF, 30x zoom, 3.0 \" lcd screen to view your pictures which is very bright I believed in my opinion.In addition to that, you can upload pictures/videos directly to YouTube and Facebook. Also, It records 720p HD videos so you can use it as a camcorder as well. Mostly I liked in this camera it has a Lithium ion rechargeable battery, so you don't need to buy the battery anymore. The battery charging time is about an hour to be fully charge. The shutter speed is fine but not as fast like the some other DSLR cameras. But we know this is a bridge camera so it should be ok. The camera supports SD Card. The picture format is JPEG. The PANORAMA feature is also a plus. Overall, so far I haven't seen any problem with it and I am very happy i choose this camera. Definitely I will suggest it to all who wants to spend less for a camera and save some couple of dollars with a good quality.

Because the video format may degrade the quality of the photos, I've also added photos to the customer photo gallery.The short, non-video version:Pros: excellent optics for a non-DSLR; great 30x optical zoom and even better macro; built-in flash plus hot shoe for an external flash; manual and automatic settings; option to select LCD screen or traditional viewfinder; ability to tweak shutters speed, aperture (see cons); good image stabilization with 30x zoom; good set of controls and scene options; ability to shoot panoramas (two methods, one without a tripod); two different ways to zoom; easy to grip and steady camera.Cons: only two aperture settings available at a given time; continuous shots take too long to write to memory, making it easy to miss the next action sequence; lens cap is a pain; video quality is so-so.Neutrals: SDHC/SDXC memory card sold separately; uses rechargeable lithium battery (buy a second one!); software not compatible with Mac OS X Lion and Mountain Lion (but I use iPhoto anyway); setting to allow digital zoom but I recommend zooming and cropping in your photo program to get the same result with more control.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW great photos!", "Author": "Patricia T.", "ReviewID": "R1PR1RXTJLJU7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the times when I hike or travel and don't want to carry my expensive/heavy duty camera equipment & lenses for fear of damaging them or don't want to carry the extra weight of them while backpacking/birdwatching.I thought the camera would be pretty good, but I never expected it to take such AWESOME pics! The pics turn out very professional. I haven't tried all the features yet, but the macro/super macro is fantastic, as is the telephoto zoom and panoramic feature! the picture quality is just as good as my expensive Canon's and Nikon's pics! I've even taken pictures through the car window as the car was moving and I was amazed to find that the photos weren't blurry and were clear & sharp. Another great feature is that there's two buttons for the telephoto zoom, one on each side of the camera to make it easy and comfortable for zooming in on anything in any position. My only two complaints are--- that you need to remember to take the lens cap off before turning the camera on, or the lens cap will get jammed and you have to turn the camera off again to release it, and the on/off switch sticks sometimes if you don't hit it dead center. Those things are easily fixed with practice, the more you use it, the less of a problem they are.Excellent camera! All in a small lightweight package.If you love photography, get it, you'll love it! :)", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome! Best Camera ever from a mom's point of view. I love this camera!", "Author": "Enchanted  In  Dixie \"Enchanted\"", "ReviewID": "R20QG62HW9GTS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a professional just a mom and grammy. I love that this camera gives me all the benefits of my old Vivitar manual camera and my Cannon camcorder in one. I can zoom not only from the top button on your right looking out, but there is a manual zoom tab on your left of the lense (this little option is great for the left handed).I have always wanted to do panoramic pics and this makes it so easy. You set the dial and choose to pan left to right or right to left. Then all you do is take the first photo, and move camera to the other 2 positions. There is a white circle with empty plus in middle on screen.  You move the camera until you see a yellow plus sign. When you match up the plus sign to the empty circle this camera automatically takes the 2nd and 3rd photos. There is no way to make a mistake on the panoramic photo.The video recorder is awesome. I was impressed, that I was able to video tape my new grandson (I was next to him) in a resturant and it picked up his ahs and coos.  I purchased to get the most out of my camera. SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s (SDSDX-032G-X46)The 3 inch screen on the back is nice and clear and since digital you can review and delete as wanted.The lithium ion rechargeable battery is specialized, you can recharge it.Love that it comes with a strap to attache the lense cap to the camera (no more lost lense caps).Comfortable shoulder / neck strap has a texture on the underside to keep it from sliping around.Push the top button on your left looking out to make the flash pop up ( so easy).You can change the photo to be black and white (many more functions to discover).Box includes instructions, Camera, battery, a compact wall charger, cables to hook up to computer (for downloard), lense cap, short lense strap to attach, and shoulder strap.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "John B. Goode \"JBG\"", "ReviewID": "RR0CZQATXK6PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent bridge camera especially for its price. I give it 5 stars for it's capabilities for what it is. People who expect to get the capabilities of a DSLR with a 720mm telephoto lens will be disappointed; despite its looks, this camera is not a DSLR. It's a bridge camera and as that it fulfils its task well. For those who want to skip a bunch of camera talk, just go to the last paragraph. (My experience: I've owned SLRs for 30 years and digital cameras for 15.)A bridge camera is midway between a point-and-shoot and a DSLR. Simply speaking, it's better than a compact point-and-shoot because it has more functions (allowing you more control) and a better lens. It is however more bulky and usually more expensive (but definitely not in this case).Versus a DSLR, a bridge camera does not have as many functions, as good an image sensor or access to high quality interchangeable lenses. (And of course it does not have the mirror that flips up or the optical viewfinder.)Pros, what I like about this camera:I like this camera a lot. It has a decent lens with a zoom that is the equivalent of 24-720mm on a regular 35mm camera. A 24mm is a pretty wide angle and a 720mm lens is the equivalent to one those huge lenses you see photographers carry at sports events.Modes: Multiple modes including the general auto, scene recognition auto, panorama and custom. Scene recognition has a ton of modes: portrait, landscape, fireworks, night, snow, etc. More importantly it has aperture priority, shutter priority and manual modes.Viewfinders: It has the usual LED panel in the back and an EVF (electronic view finder). The EVF is the digital version of the optical viewfinder. When you look at either, it's WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). There is a little lag with the EVF but I'm very glad they included one because after 4-5 digital cameras I still don't like looking at the LED panel. With the EVF you can look through it like you're aiming it.Software: All the usual stuff is there, you can zoom, crop, delete, etc. It's true plug and play. I just connect the camera to my Windows 7 and I was able to download the pics without installing any software.Picture quality: Two resolutions (fine and normal), sizes L, M and S and each with screen ratios of 4:3 to 16:9. For my 4GB card I can take 500+ pictures at the highest quality to 6000+ at the lowest quality. At the higher resolutions a regular 4 X 6 print looks great. Only when you stretch the capacity of this camera, say the highest of zooms at the low resolution, does the picture quality look blurry, but for regular usage it's fine.Video: Like all digital cameras nowadays it has video capacity but I'm only using this as a camera so I have not reviewed it.Lens: Very good for this type of lens. Zooms, especially those with a big range will not have the best performance. Expect less than ideal performance at 30x zoom under less than perfect conditions, this is normal. I took some long distance pics at 30x zoom, but I took them with a tripod and the 2 second delay (minimize user shake) and they turned out great. You can actually zoom up to 200x digitally, but at that magnification, you must use a tripod and the 2s delay.Cons: Really, I have no complaint. I list a couple here offhand which can be rectified by buying one camera up, for example the Fuji HS30EXR.1) Max f stop at 3.12) No RAW format (though I doubt most people using this camera will care).Summary: This camera is for those who want a better lens and more functions/control than a point-and-shoot. It's also for those who are not ready for the next step or expense of a DSLR or a MILC. It has a decent lens with an amazing 30x (24-720mm) zoom and functions galore. You can look at it as a cheap DSLR without the SLR or the interchangeable lens. It's a true bridge camera and at the current price (same as many compacts) you just can't lose.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very decent inexpensive still and 720P video camera", "Author":

It shows tests on auto-focus response on videos as well as handheld full 30x zoom.  To see the full resolution video, search for \"Fuji SL300 stills and video samples\" online.This is a nice budget camera that can do a lot of things. It can shoot great stills, 720P videos, panorama, it can detect smiles and shoot automatically without pressing the shutter, manual and custom settings and you can shoot either via the large 3\" LCD screen or the viewfinder.  By the way, the LCD screen do not tilts.By default the camera is set to digital zoom.  When you are shooting videos, the digital zoom stutters and uncontrollably fast, which is almost useless.  There is no way to slow it down no matter how gentle you are with the zoom controls.  The trick is to go to the LCD menu and change it to optical zoom.  Now you have nice and smooth zooming all the way to 30X for videos.  The only problem with the optical zoom is that you will hear the motor while shooting a movie.Strengths:- For the money, you get a lot of camera.- 30X optical zoom- Shoots stunning macros- Stabilization.  I am amazed how good it works handheld while panning.- Panorama is sweet.  It is very easy to do by overlapping the plus signs on the screen and the camera automatically shoots for you (3 frames only).  Only one direction though, from left to right.- There are two ways to activate zoom.  Around the shutter button and on the left side of the lens barrel.- The smile detection feature works without the need to press the shutter.- supplied with a lithium-ion battery and wall chargerLimitations:- The video is mediocre on low light / foggy situation.- On shooting videos, focus struggles once you pass 12x zoom and up.- Focus also gets confused easily when shooting moving subjects.- No external micWhat's not in the box:- You need to provide your own SD card.- Also missing is the micro HDMI cableOverall, this is a very good camera at this price point (around 240$ at the time of the review).", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Steamed", "ReviewID": "R26PDH78YRI6NU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Learned the hard way that Fuji camera movable lens are not sealed from dust and grit and Fuji does do not cover a camera that stops working due to dust or grit under warranty.

I've owned or used some of them. The SL300, however, is far from the top of the pack. Nothing about the SL300 is awful or a real show-stopper, but there are lots of things which are not top-notch about this camera. Image quality at ISO 400 or above deteriorates so rapidly that the resulting images are unusable for serious purposes at 100%. Lots of noise. In my test shots down my street, filled with trees in various stages of changing color, at ISO 800 - which was necessary for hand-held shots in the minutes before sunset - the leaves resolved to smudges and blobs. Mortar between the bricks of the building across the street were somewhat indistinct. The 30X zoom is supposed to be a selling point, but in my real-world testing, the zoom was very slow and the autofocus was incredibly slow and imprecise. Handheld shots at ISO 800 were blurred - the image stabilization simply wasn't up to the task. I used the flash in an interior hallway, about 20 feet long with some ambient illumination at both ends. The flash was barely sufficient to illuminate the end of the hallway. I did some flash shots inside a dark room. A wall about 10 feet away was not only not evenly illuminated, but the pre-flash focus didn't work well and the things hanging on the wall were not in focus. There's a see-through viewfinder that is very grainy. The dipter adjustment is limited and very difficult to work with. The 3\" LCD is bright and pretty clear, but strikes me as having less visible area than other cameras with the same screen size.  Manual control, a necessity for creative photography is very limited. I couldn't find any way to get an aperture of either f3.1 or f8. That appears to be it. The camera is quite large, almost as if the designers intentionally wanted it to look like an expensive DSLR. It is also somewhat heavy. On the whole, I am not favorably impressed. I consider myself an intermediate, perhaps even advanced, hobbyist. For my serious shooting, the SL300 simply won't do for the reasons listed above. However, for some people who shoot outdoors in bright light and with a low ISO, the extreme telephoto might come in handy. So three-stars seems fair.Jerry", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A `tweener camera for fence-sitting amateurs", "Author": "Eric C. Sedensky \"late-to-jazz musician\"", "ReviewID": "R3R6UEMNIT7YEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Allow me to start with a disclaimer: I have studied photography in a formal setting, and have used professional or near-professional grade cameras, lenses, and equipment (yes, even film) for the better part of 25 years. I'm not a beginner. So, right away, I noticed this camera did not, and could not, perform anywhere near professional level. That said, I think this is still a fairly decent, easy to use camera at a very reasonable price point.This camera comes with far fewer manual settings than most cameras. Also, the zoom feature is controlled by a motor from a switch on the side of the lens. It is slow to respond and difficult to control, but assuming that most people will only ever go all the way in or all the way out (for the most part), it's not much of a drawback. The lens cap is also a little funky, with the grip levers in the middle, presumably to reduce the chance of putting a fingerprint or garbage on the lens when removing it. To take photos, you have the all or nothing option of viewing through the viewfinder or looking at the screen on the back. The viewfinder is not a true viewfinder, but actually a mini display screen inside the view finder. It looked funky and unnatural. As for taking pictures, this operated quite intuitively, and I was able to take acceptable photographs of objects and scenery and pets, always in good lighting with little or no movement. In low lighting, it was not able to compensate (without using the flash) for the light levels, and most low light shots ended up being blurry. For someone who has never had a professional camera and has always used a point-and-shoot or pocket model, its performance will be noticeably better than those.This camera talks a lot. It has all kinds of beeps, and dings, and whoops, and the photo snapping sound is the weirdest of all. Again, if you are used to something better, this may be an issue, but if this is your first digital SLR, you will probably learn the meaning of all the little noises and be quite comfortable operating the camera in no time.The strap is solid and handy, but the slots are poorly designed with some sticky-out portions that make threading the strap the hardest thing about this camera. If you're replacing a point and shoot and don't need a strap, that would be lucky.I didn't use the panorama feature, which combines multiple shots into a long, scaled photograph, but the missus was excited about it. She said that it did sort of okay, but that the stitching was inadequate, so again, another feature somewhere in the middle - maybe useful for some people, probably not very useful for others.All in all, this is an above average camera for a low to low-mid-scale market. If you aren't publishing your pictures and taking a bajillion of them, this is a good choice to save some money and get decent results. If you really need to take high-quality, high-definition pictures under different conditions, or are planning a trip of a lifetime or something like that, you might want to consider adding a couple hundred bucks to your camera budget and spring for a Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm IS II Lens and EOS HD Movie Mode (Black) or something along those lines instead. Otherwise, this Fuji will work.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "good entry-level digital camera", "Author": "Terry R. Nye", "ReviewID": "R2A28FWYJCCWHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm FinePix SL300 digital camera is a fine entry-level digital camera for those interested in playing around with digital photography without spending a lot of money.  For such an inexpensive camera it is loaded with features that will enable you to easily take photos, shoot video, and create special effects.The camera arrives well-packaged with everything you need to take pictures except the memory card.  You will want to buy a good SDHC memory card to use with it.  There is no printed owner's manual - it is all on a CD - which is a disappointment.  The provided quick start information is enough to get you going, though.  The included lithium ion rechargeable battery needs to be charged before the camera is used.  The battery is rather large but charges quickly.  The included charger is a little odd.  You have to slide on a separate piece with the AC plug which locks onto the main charger.  If you lose that piece you are out of luck.  A USB cable is included to connect the camera to your computer.  Like full-size SLR cameras, the lens uses a plastic lens cap (included) which also comes with a special tether you can use to secure it to your camera when not in use.  The camera cannot be turned on, though, until you remove the lens cover.  If you forget, the LCD screen will give you a reminder to turn the camera off and remove the cover before turning it back on.The camera itself is a little bulky.  It is definitely smaller than a typical SLR digital camera but clearly not a pocket camera either.  For its size it is quite lightweight.  It has a rather cheap plastic feel to it that makes it feel very fragile.  Cameras should never be handled roughly, but this one likely merits extra care.  The lens is not removable like a true SLR camera, but it has an impressive 30x optical zoom that will get you close to your subject.  The LCD screen on the back is very big and clear.  The controls are well-placed and easy to use.  I found it very intuitive to use the controls to navigate between the different options, and it is fairly simple to figure out even without usage of the owner's manual.  You change shooting modes with a wheel switch on the top of the camera, and whenever you make a change the LCD screen will tell you what mode you have selected and what it can do.  Like other SLR cameras you can adjust aperture and shutter speed settings to get creative with your picture taking, although the availability of only two aperture settings (F3.1 and F8) is very disappointing.  There are several automatic modes available including aperture priority, shutter speed priority, manual, auto, scene-based auto, panorama, and video.  The built-in flash is automatic, but you have to open it with a push button first in order for it to work.  There is a flash shoe on the top of the viewfinder that enables you to attach a separate flash if desired.  It's a nice feature that you would expect on a much nicer SLR, but I really can't imagine someone purchasing a separate flash for this camera as it would cost as much or more as the camera itself.So how well does it work?  The photos are quite good in decent light.  You can shoot at normal or high resolution, and at 14 megapixels you will get resolution easily good enough for printing photos or posters.  The color is accurate.  The camera adjusts well to low-light situations in auto mode, and it shoots fairly quickly for a camera in this class.  It can even be set to detect if someone blinks when shooting portrait photos so you will know to shoot it again.  You do not have the range of creativity that a more expensive true SLR camera would offer, particularly with its limited aperture settings, but you can take some pretty nice photos with this camera.Overall, you get a lot of camera at this price point.  This is not the camera to buy if you want something to carry in your pocket.  You will definitely want to buy a bag for it.  It is not the camera to buy if you want to be able to use different lenses.  But it is a very good entry-level camera for someone who is new to digital photography or interested in experimenting with what an SLR camera can do without having to spend a lot of money.  If you want to spend under $300 for a digital camera with some features similar to an SLR camera, and this one is currently selling for well under that, the Fujifilm FinePix SL300 is well worth consideration.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Finepix SL300 - Love it!", "Author": "JP6611", "ReviewID": "R29LY20YD27XP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review is from the POV of someone who is a complete beginner to photography.

The USB Port seemed to be jammed the first time I used it. Yes, I inserted the cable properly. I have purchased over a dozen digital cameras (for myself and family members), so I'm always mindful to check the curvature of the USB connection. The second time I tried to use the USB port, it was so difficult that I thought I had somehow turned the cable the wrong way. Upon checking, I had inserted it properly. The problem was clearly with the port inside the camera.  I returned the camera to FUJI for repair. Two weeks later, I get a form letter saying that it would cost $150.00 to repair the USB Port! That's exactly what I paid for the camera, so clearly they are insane. I guess they were going to use my money to buy another one from Amazon to send to me. :-(  What company makes a product and doesn't cover essential parts in the warranty? FUJI, for one. The camera works well, but you can find a equally good one from Kodak, Olympus, and others at this price and feature range. It's only advantage is the connection for a hotshoe.  I am giving it ONE STAR (I would give it ZERO) because Fuji swindles customers by not covering the USB Port, and I'm sure most consumers don't know that.  I hope that other reviewers will start indicating whether a certain part on the camera is not covered by the warranty since that is critically important in the purchasing decision.

Zoom lens and some good features.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R3F4QGW9B2WYUI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are several reviews here comparing this camera to DSLRs and they mention that this camera comes up short. Well, that is to be expected as DSLRs are in the $600 plus price range and this camera is sub $200.Cameras with greater zooms have become popular in recent times as cell phones now offer better picture taking than some point and shoots. These days hardly anyone carries that tiny point and shoot as the smartphone suffices, plus you can instantly share your pictures. That is the reason for the advent of these bigger greater zoom cameras at low price points. This camera from Fujifilm is great for a beginner who wants to graduate from instagraming from their smartphone camera to taking some real shots.Fujifilm has always excelled at putting large zoom lenses on consumer point and shoots at a reasonable price point, but overall if you compare picture taking abilities their cameras fall behind Canon, Nikon and even Panasonic in a similar category. I already have a Canon DSLR (T3i) and other smaller zoom point and shoots (Canon,Panasonic, and Fujifilm 2-3 years old). My teenager was looking for a higher zoom camera for her photography and not wanting to hand over the DSLR I gave this camera to her and she absolutely loves it.This camera is very versatile due to higher zoom but it's also pretty bulky, so the one disadvantage is that you may not want to carry it at all times. However, its a must for any occasion where you know you will be taking photographs. Since we got this camera, I hardly ever take my lower zoom point and shoots anywhere. It takes wonderful pictures in good natural lighting. The colors are natural and pictures are sharp. In my opinion, Canon P&S; cameras sometimes over process and over saturate colors but Fujifilm colors come out more natural. It allowed my daughter to take some wonderfully natural portraits of family from a slight distance and our expressions were very natural as we were unaware she was taking them. This has proved to be an asset even at parties. The camera does have an intelligent mode which allows you to take the same picture in natural lighting and then fires the flash for the same picture, so if you're not sure you'll get the best image with natural lighting you can use that mode.There is a Panorama mode that allows longer shots for panoramic nature shots. This type of shot is also available in other brands such as Canon in scene modes but Fujifilm offers it as a dial setting which is convenient.The shutter speed of the camera is a little slow for action shots but it can still take respectable shots at a distance if the movement is relatively show, as in a school performance. The outdoor natural light performance of this camera is much better than the indoor low light performance. However, this is the case with most point and shoots but Fujifilm requires a little more handling in adjusting white balance and aperture than say, a Sony camera. I've found Sony cameras or some CMOS based cameras to perform the best in low lighting. The Manual mode can be selected and adjustments made for low lighting.The Macro mode of this camera is useful, and allowed me to take some detailed foliage pictures.The one big downside of this camera is that it does not have an onscreen battery indicator and sometimes the camera just died on me when I thought the battery was fully charged.So overall, a decent camera for the money. If you can spend another $50 or $100 you should look at Canon, Panasonic, Nikon brand cameras that are a little more expensive (for similar zoom and other features) but offer easier picture taking in multiple scenarios. With the Fujifilm you have to work a little bit if you don't have great lighting to take great shots.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price....", "Author": "Confucious", "ReviewID": "R29CRGAHNNIC6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is excellent for the price.

And i don't know how this camera don't get 4.5 stars.I shoot photos with the automatic function for a while and i must say it shoots brilliant photos in daylight. I find the colours very natural in outdoors. Just only on automatic I am very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the photos taken. It must have something to do with fuji quality lens. Automatic.. automatic.. just automatic function is enough to impress me. If your using in the dark, it still can be okay if you pop up the flash. Incredibly enough, the pictures still can come out quite detailed. At least, it is satisfyingly detailed for me. But if you think automatic function is about it for this camera, you are terribly wrong.There are many interesting features like the EVF, zoom and the many presets function on the function dial. Personally if you asked me, i like cameras to have a viewfinder. It is not about the viewfinder how functional it is or how \"extra and unnecessary it can be\", but that it gives you options to use whichever you want to. For an amateur photographer/user, that can be a liberating experience- the old film camera way or the new digital way. When an affordable camera gives a newbie options, it can be almost an adventurous experience when you can choose to switch back and forth to use LCD or the EVF, exploring different styles of capturing images. It is rare to find a digital camera with EVF all-in-one purchase, moreover at this affordable price.There are many presets functions that are useful. One particular one which i found fun was the multi-shot. The 3 photos are taken in a zoom- in manner. So the first one was like 1x zoom and the second one zoom in further on the subject and the third one even more focus on the subject(like 3x). It works something like that, pardon my vague description. The main thing is that the 3 photos for that multi-shoot all look incredible in their own ways- different, each of them portrays the subject differently.I also tried the panoramic ones but not as pleasing. The images are slightly fragmented, you can see some weird fragments. But it can be easy to use though.The F-stops under manual is too restricting. There's only 2 f-stops30x optical zoom provide lots of zoom enough but anything higher than 14x zoom it will take forever to focus. The focus time is slow but at times still works okay. Sometimes doesnt focus at all(auto) which is a little disappointing.This camera is definitely not pocketable and i wont pocket any camera if i can. It's so easy to damage the lens if you are not careful. The provided accessories like neck-sling and lens cap are good enough so you dont have to go look for another one.No comments on video-taking. Functional enough for me.Battery life sucks though. Got into 2 bar battery after 30-40 shots. Not satisfying enough. Get another spare battery with you.Still despite all this cons, i find this camera to my liking. Stylish looking camera with great features and performance.PROS:-Outstanding Image quality.

Hannon", "ReviewID": "R1YZO6EF22XFF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon's gold box deal couldn't have come at a better time! I could not afford to replace my late, much lamented DSLR camera. So I've been trying to adapt to birding without a camera and just enjoying the sights as they happen rather than recording them for study and identification later. Definitely lessened the pleasure for me. So when the Fujifilm Finepix SL300 came available at a price I could squeeze out of my budget, I jumped at it!I ordered the red body - doesn't affect the camera in any way, but I love the cheery brightness of it. I've taken it out birding several times now, and have to say I am quite happy with it. I'm not a camera pro, so all the technical stuff is beyond me. It doesn't have quite the performance of my Canon EOS Rebel T1i, nor did I expect it to. But it easily outperforms my first digital camera, the Olympus SP510-UZ, and it was a darn sight less expensive than either of those.I've been able to take identifiable photos of small birds in trees up to 25 - 30 feet high above me, even in dim light, and the burst shooting has helped me record several really cool in-flight shots as well. The optical zoom stays clear and focused the whole way to 30x although the pictures get a bit grainy in low light. The controls are easy to use, basically consistent with both of my previous digital cameras, so the learning curve is not too steep. There are lots of options to tailor your photography to difference circumstances, and the SR-Auto mode selects the options that best match conditions in most cases. As with all auto-focus cameras, there is sometimes a discrepancy between what you think you're taking the picture of, and what the camera thinks (and focuses on). But less frequently than I expected. SR-Auto seems to know what it's doing.That's the good part. The most significant drawback I've noticed is that the battery doesn't hold the charge very long. I had to recharge after 82 shots. With the Canon I usually got over 1000 shots on a single charge, and the Olympus was usually good for at least 500 or so. If that continues, I will have to get a case of extra batteries, as I routinely shoot a thousand pictures or more per outing.Also, I miss the 400mm lens, and the digiscope conversion capability that I had with the Canon, so I will probably continue to save up for the dream DSLR setup, but in the meantime, I expect to spend several years of good birding, taking perfectly adequate shots with this camera. And if I ever get the dream setup, I know I will have a reliable backup to take along when I go out.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for intermediate photographer", "Author": "Lori A", "ReviewID": "R3CE6EG11JKAJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter has a passion for photography, amongst other things.

As often as not when we are in the car, she sees something and says, \"Oh darn, I don't have my camera with me!\" After hearing this time & time again, I got her the Fujifilm SL300 specifically to keep in the car. Our Canon XSi is 12MP, and with the L series lenses she uses, the quality is very nice. I hoped this camera would be suitable for occasional shots that would go missed without a camera.I chose the Fuji camera for the 30X optical zoom and 14MP density. Most shots she sees are nature, birds and wildlife when out and about. I also figured that the viewfinder, in addition to the onscreen viewing, would allow her to use the camera as she does the SLR.She's had it a couple weeks now and is quite happy with the results. A few of the shots have been posted on our webpage, [...] and compare favorably with other shots. The zoom is very good and delivers crisp results. She's learning the ins & outs and has many features yet to try. The camera is easy to understand, and follows many of the standards found on the Canon SLR. The SD cards are the same as our Canon, so no problem there.CONS:The viewfinder is a bit cumbersome to use. Instead of showing the image through the lens, it is a projected view. There is a small wheel that allows you to focus the viewfinder, but it is easier to look at the screen than adjust the viewfinder.The camera will not turn on if the lens cover is still in place; a message is displayed on the screen. You have to shut the power back off, take off the lens cover and restart the camera. That deer or turkey beside the road will be gone before she can get that done if she is in a hurry and forgets.The battery life is rather short, but that can be from spending time exploring the features. The battery is a rechargeable pack specific to this camera. You can't pop in some extra AA batteries. We'll need to charge the battery in the house, or get a car charger for our purpose.So, overall it is a nice little camera that fits our need.

She'd taken some pictures with mine (with the black body) when we were all on a vacation at the beach back earlier this fall and found herself very much enjoying the experience.  In her words, she'd never had a nice camera herself, so getting to use this one (mine) was a treat for her.  The photos she took were all quite nice and demonstrated that she had a decent eye for getting nice pictures.There is NO difference between the red and black bodies other than the paint finish.  The red looks very nice and does match the pictures you see here at Amazon.  By getting the red one for my brother's widow it remains easy for either of us to pull out our camera's at family gatherings without worrying over mixing the two cameras up.  On the other hand, having two cameras that are otherwise exactly the same makes it very easy for either of us to pick up the other camera and just start snapping photos.I remain awed by the relative value of these cameras.  With typical Amazon pricing these cameras deliver great value for the purchase price.  They do \"feel\" a little flimsy, but again, I'd soften my original review a bit by saying these are good quality cameras that are easy to operate and light enough to carry around while being out and about where you think you might want to capture some pictures.Still not quite perfect, but closer than I might have said earlier. :-)Original review follows:Yet again I'm left wishing that I could give a product a rating somewhere between \"I really like it\" and \"I absolutely love it\".  Sadly that isn't possible, so I'm left rounding down a little as I try not to hand out perfect ratings unless, well, I'm dealing with perfection.It is hard for me to put my finger on exactly why I couldn't rate this item perfect, perhaps it's the bulk and heftiness; perhaps it's the \"feel\" of this camera which somehow misses on feeling as sturdy and durable as the Sony DSC HX1 (Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1)) that started me down lovers lane with the whole range of high-zoom digital cameras.  Even compared to the Nikon Coolpix P100 (Nikon Coolpix P100) that I later bought as I wondered if it was any better (for my uses) than the Sony, well, I'm still not sure... it's just this Fujifilm FinePix SL300 feels obviously different than either of those two cameras.  Note, even in comparison to the Sony DSC HX30V (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V) that I've grown to like more than I originally thought I would, this feels much more cheaply made even though I don't think it really is.I would have to go a little further here though and note that the price tag on this Fujifilm FinePix SL300 is considerably lower and highly competitive compared to either of those previously mentioned cameras and that perhaps explains a bit of the difference in the feel of this camera versus those.  I suppose it is also entirely possible that Fujifilm made this camera feel as it does because it was part of a very conscious design decision to remove some of the heft and weight that those other cameras have, knowing that on optics alone, they were already faced with a camera that could be hefty compared to what most people might typically carry around as their primary digital camera.  Carrying around a good high-zoom camera can leave a user feeling a bit worn down depending on the length of time they have to carry the camera, not to mention any accessories (additional batteries, a camera bag/case, etc.) so eliminating some of the weight would be a good thing to aim for.In a previous review of lower end point-and-shoot cameras I noted that given the continued improvements in the cameras that are built into today's smart phones the more traditional camera manufacturers needed to do more to set themselves apart and offer a highly competitive product and I would say that perhaps was a large consideration for Fujifilm with this camera.There's an awful lot to like here.  A list that I really think is a bit too long to even start on.  Other reviewers and/or Amazon themselves may list those things in the product specifications or in their reviews, but I'll try to more succinct here (though I have co-workers and friends that would be amazed if I ever truly pulled that off ;-) ).I do like the rubberized grip around the lens area.  It offers a very comfortable and firm grip to the user.  Go beyond that and I'd note that I like the zoom controls on the left side of the lens (when you are facing the camera at a target).  It is nice to have those controls available to either hand and may help to leave lefties feeling some sense of inclusion in a world dominated by those that are right-handed.The zoom capabilities are impressive.  30x optical is near the top end of the affordable range.Add on affordability for that same 30x capability.  The pricing of this item is incredibly competitive, especially when compared against the other cameras (or the current versions/products in those lines) that I listed.I like the viewfinder and the option to NOT be forced to looking at the LCD screen for aiming at photo subjects.Not necessarily an advanced high-zoom camera, but not bad at all for someone looking to get into that realm without breaking the bank.  Really, when compared to other cameras feature for feature, a pretty darned competitive camera at a very competitive price.  Certainly worth considering as a great beginners high-zoom camera.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good camera", "Author": "Terry", "ReviewID": "R24C5KF3ZY8MU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't want to go all out and get a 35 mm camera that I would need to get extra lens for.

It has a whole lot more features than I'm used to-- I'm not really a technology person.  I'm used to just a simple point & shoot kind of camera with not many features, so this camera is a tad overwhelming for me, but I just look at it as an opportunity for me to learn more.  It was also more than I was really okay with spending, but its well worth it.  I was wanting a better camera than the one I previously had, for more professional-type photos and this was an excellent choice.  The user manual that comes with the camera is quite helpful.  I keep it in my camera bag just in case I need to look up which setting would be best for whatever type of photo I am taking.  I love that you can switch back and forth from the LCD screen and the viewfinder.  I find that having the rechargeable battery is so much better than having to put batteries in it.  I do recommend buying at least one additional battery, though.  I'm just starting to use my camera, trying it out, familiarizing myself with the features....and the fully charged battery was used up quite quickly.  I sure hope it doesnt normally drain that fast, but either way, it sucks when your battery dies and then you dont have a backup battery and you cant take pictures till its charged.  But again, I think the rechargeable battery is cheaper than continuously going through regular batteries, like some other cameras use.  The lens cap is a bit annoying since you have to press the grip levers...I'd rather have one that snaps on.  The strap that comes with the camera is good.  Feels and looks well made.  I LOVE that you can add notes to your photos... I had never had a camera before that was capable of that, so I find this very awesome.  You can take a picture, then go to review it and there is an option to add an audio recording to it-- for me this is helpful because when I travel, I can add an audio note so that when I go to look at the pictures later, I will have those notes as a reminder of the exact place I was at.  I'm not sure how silhouettes are taken or if this camera is capable, but I'd like to find out.  It has a panoramic setting, which I'm learning is pretty neat.  The 30x zoom is great-- you can zoom in REALLY close on objects that are far away, and it still picks up on all the detail.  I had a little bit of difficulty finding a camera bag.  I wanted to buy one locally because I think it easier to return items that way if I get the wrong thing as opposed to when I purchase online.  Unfortunately, the stores I went to around here didnt have much of a variety.  I am very happy with the bag I got, but if you plan to carry camera accessories with you, you'll be looking at getting, what I consider to be, a large bag.  I do wish the user manual was more detailed.  For someone like me who isnt used to a camera with so many features, it'd be nice if the manual explained more.  There are terms in there that I'm not at all familiar with.  Also, I like that there are little indentations for where your thumb and index finger rest.

It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot).

Great Zoom!", "Author": "V. Hutson", "ReviewID": "R1A66B9M17UCKK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a decent camera for the price.  The two features I like the most are the 30x Optical zoom and the HD video.  The optical zoom really enables you to get up-close to far away objects.  The HD video is always a nice feature.  It doesn't go as high as full HD, but it is still acceptable.This camera does falls short of my other cameras (Canon T2i and Canon Powershot SX230 HS).  Obviously, the FinePix SL300 wouldn't be able to compete with the much more expensive T2i, but it also falls a bit short in image quality, controls, and ease of use when compared to the less expensive Powershot SX230 HS.I have mixed feelings about the overall size of the camera.  It looks like a mini d-SLR and it is very easy to hold.  The downside is that it is very large when compared with my Powershopt SX230 HS and therefore not nearly as convenient to carry.Bottom line: Some nice features and I really like the powerful zoom, but I'll be sticking with my Canon cameras.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Adequate budget superzoom compact camera", "Author": "J. Gitzlaff", "ReviewID": "R1ZWBYSODUPR2V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera; and though it has some nice specs (30x zoom, for instance), I really can't recommend this unit with the panoply of other choices out there.  On the good side, this camera feels nice in the hand.  Easy to grip, not fatiguing to hold, and all controls easy to access in sensible locations on the body.  It has the right number of physical buttons and a menu system that is intuitive to operate.At the same time, there are many negatives.  The EVF doesn't turn on automatically, you need to manually switch it on and off when you want to use it.  The image quality of the EVF is decent when holding the camera steady and facing a stationary subject, but the image refreshes so slowly that if you pan the camera or try to shoot a moving subject (kids) the image smears and stutters so badly you cannot use it. Effectively that means you need to use the rear view screen almost all the time.The 30x zoom is nice on paper, but the image stabilization can't keep up with it.  There is too much jitter and jump to use anything more than around 5-10x unless you have the camera configured to use a very fast shutter, which is difficult in the heat of the moment because so many controls are automated. Manual controls exist, but they take time to engage and are not as we'll implemented as in many  cameras that cost slightly more.  Couple the image stabilization shortcomings with the EVF smearing I mentioned above and you have a real problem.Other minor nits: this camera is pretty large and light. Feels like a plastic case with a lot of unused dead air inside. Image quality is decent for basic purposes, but there is little fine detail at the pixel level and a lot of over-sharpening around edges.For comparison sake, see the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model), which admittedly costs significantly more, but in my personal experience is a vastly better product.  The Sony has a MUCH better and more useful zoom all the way out to that camera's 20x maximum, mainly because of better stabilization and easier controls to ensure a fast shutter.  The Sony weighs about the same but is half the size of the Fuji, mainly because of better engineering so there is less dead air inside the case. Similar contrasts could be illustrated, but my point is that this Fuji may be a decent all-around budget superzoom, but it has problems and trade offs, and it probably isn't the best choice if you can save enough money to afford buying the next level up.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelente producto", "Author": "Luis Balzan", "ReviewID": "R7NC857JC79MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buen producto por un buen precio adecuado, excelente c\u00e1mara para un aficionado a la fotograf\u00eda, la recomiendo sin duda alguna.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthless", "Author": "Realist", "ReviewID": "R2HMN5XNG7GI7P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera worthless.

Se ela for ligada antes, a capa fica presa e temo por danificar a lente.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOOD", "Author": "Carmen Carrasquel", "ReviewID": "R1ZG1XQDELHGCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good product, excellent conditions, lo recomiendo 100%, not dude in buying it . . . . . . .", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Portraits or Posters?", "Author": "Ambarish N Mehta", "ReviewID": "REDKN5J2S2QLS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have not used it much but I tried taking some pictures during an indoor party with setting on Auto.

It was okay, and less than the one I had walked in there wanting, so I though, why not?I bought it, brought it home, charged the battery, within a few hours I was taking pictures. The quality of these pictures was worse than the shots on my ipod, which are horrific.The pictures came out dark, grainy, shaddowed, and so blurry I couldnt make out who was who. i adjusted the settings such as shutter speed, ISO, etc., and even my photographer DAD had a crack at it, the photos did not improve. After flipping on the flash the subjects were washed out, even when I backed up and used the zoom. i thought maybe the pics were so bad was because i was inside, and the sales guy DID say it was an outdoor camera.No difference. the 'super zoom' takes FOREVER, like YEARS AND YEARS to focus even when it was only at around 4x. (the optical zoom is up to 30.) even not using the zoom at all, the focus was crappy.i boxed it back up immediatly, and will be driving over to the store and returning it TODAY. guess i'll just have to save up for my Sony Cyber-shot dSC-hx200v, which is AMAZING. my cousin has it, so this time i'm not buying a camera blindly. i should have known better than to make up my mind right there in the store, rather than going home, thinking it over, reading a few proffesional reviews.whatever.Just saying, good luck if you end up purchasing this camera.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "defective goods.
