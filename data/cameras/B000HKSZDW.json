{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent camera; not the best I've owned.", "Author": "Jennifer Goodson \"Jenny G.\"", "ReviewID": "RPJFEUCHFH05U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera works fairly well.  You have to have hands of stone, however, because any movement causes a blur to the pictures.  There's also quite a long delay between the flash and the picture taking.  You have to hold the camera for a few seconds after the flash goes off or your picture will not take properly.  It's definitely not the best for taking candid shots of toddlers.  The videos are not good quality, always looking grainy.  My three-year-old son likes to snitch it and seems to get better shots/videos with it than I do.  I may even end up just giving it to him for his fourth birthday since he loves cameras.  The price makes it great for a gift.  It's not difficult to use either.  If you are planning to use this camera for stills, I'd say it would be a great choice.  Personally, I'll just stick with my Kodak EasyShare which is great for candid kid shots.  It takes crisp, clear pictures--even with a moving subject--and it takes fantastic videos.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung Digimax A503 Red Digital Camera 5MP,", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4150xYhGQIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000HKSZDW"}}
