The listing is for a made for USA Nikon d7000, when registering the camera it was flagged as a grey market camera.  Nikons site states that they will not warranty or service any grey market cameras.  The camera came with no warranty paper work.  I recently purchased a D7100 from a reputable  dealer and the camera and lens came with Nikon USA warranty cards for everything.  Looking at Nikons site Davismax is not a official Nikon dealer.  I do not know where their cameras come from but the serial number on the camera I purchased did not register with Nikon.  One of the 2 lenses came with a Nikon world wide warranty card for 1 year, the other lens came with no warranty paper work.  I believe the camera was a real d7000 the pictures I did take with it were good and clear but with no warranty or service possibilities in the future I did not want to take the risk.  They did give me a full refund which is appreciated.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Ashish Katare", "ReviewID": "R21XLERYCOE2WS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Package came in good shape and all the items included.
