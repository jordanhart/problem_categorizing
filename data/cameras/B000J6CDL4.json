{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Leica retro camera with 21st Century electronics.", "Author": "R. Ocampo \"Artisan\"", "ReviewID": "R2R86NXUXXMZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first, Leica and Panasonic have been a team in the digital camera world in terms of Leica lens know-how coupled with Panasonic technology (just like Carl Zeiss lens is with Sony as well as Schneider Optics is with Samsung).  Take note I said Leica lens \"know-how\" because Leica is not really the lens manufacturer here, but Panasonic is - being a licensed manufacturer of Leica lens.  So to Leica purists, this isn't a Leica-assembled product.  Despite all this, it's still sold exclusively by Leica and manufactured by Panasonic for a limited batch run alongside the sister model of Panasonic, the DMC-L1.  Everything about how the Digilux 3 and DMC-L1 operate and function are the same EXCEPT for a few minor adjustments.  The most talked about and only difference is how it processes JPG pictures.Most notable option:- If you're going to shoot using RAW in order to tweak your own photos, then buying the Panasonic won't make a difference with the more expensive counterpart.  Panasonic will save you a lot of money and help you get more accessories with it.- If you grew up with the Leica brand and are familiar with the characteristics of how Leica photographs come out, Leica has especially tweaked the JPG (not RAW, for obvious reasons being RAW) photos to look the same way analog Leica photographs come out looking.Of course it's not all that simple.  Without going into a debate as to why buy Leica over Panasonic and vice-versa,  I'll talk about the general controls.MEMORY CARD:The camera uses SD or MMC cards.  It will take SDHC cards which come with minimum 4GB.  As for MMC cards, they are slow and I would suggest not even thinking of using it.The supplied 1GB memory should be enough for one day of fun.  But a 4GB SDHC or higher is recommended when shooting RAW.BATTERY:Good for 450 pictures per CIPA standards.LENS:The supplied 14-50mm lens is what makes this camera purchase worthwhile.  It's very sharp and beats any 7-8MP digital SLR cameras out there as well is arguably at par with 10MP digital SLR cameras.It patronizes the \"Fourt Thirds Mount\" set by Olympus.  So camera and body built on this standard make them interchangeable.- It has a zoom ring, an aperture ring and a focus ring in a grooved rubber application.- O.I.S. - Optical Image Stabilization to help decrease blur when doing handheld shots with a slower shutter speed.BODY:All the necessary settings a pro may need is right there by their finger tips and individually labeled - aperture, shutter, metering mode, multiple shots, auto/manual focus, flash mode, ISO speed and white balance.  Plus there are two more programmable buttons for quick access to special camera features.INTERNALS:- LiveMOS technology is the reason to get this camera from other cameras.  They say it has the best of both worlds for the quality of the CCD, but with the power-saving of a CMOS.- Dust Reduction Function - a staple in higher end SLR cameras to shake off any dust sitting on the image sensor and useful when changing lens.- Live View mode which effectively helps you focus in real-time the subject via the LCD monitor rather than the viewfinder.  A good idea on paper, but with an actual clunky application.WARRANTY:For the first six months your camera and lens (not accessories) is protected by accident.  If something happens to it for any reason no questions asked, they will repair or replace it.After the six months accident protection, you are warranted for three years from any defect of the camera.  No one can claim the same.  Not even it's sister model, the Panasonic DMC-L1.----------PROS:1. Leica lens quality and sharpness.2. LiveMOS sensor.3. Manual controls right there by your fingertips.4. Leica build quality and retro design that makes it a stand out.5. Four Thirds Mount that will help you build your lens library.6. Manual flash button rather than automatic pop up.CONS:1. Boxy, clunky body that may turn off a lot of users.2. Weight coupled with the boxy body will cause more stress in gripping the camera.3. LiveView mode definitely is version 1.0.4. O.I.S. is definitely not perfect.  It helps, but it doesn't lead you to believe that you can take better pictures with less blur.  An expensive technique rather than building the image stabilization into the body.5. Manual focus ring is typical of any digital SLR lens.  It just turns around and around without telling you have reached the end.6. Expensive camera slapped on with a red Leica logo, but actually produced in a Panasonic plant alongside a sister camera that depreciates almost monthly.7. The strap placement may be an issue with hand placement.----------In summary, this is first and foremost for Leica customers who know and appreciate the quality that Leica brings.  The warranty is second to none.  They will stand behind this 100%.The design is extreme.  If you don't fall in love with it,  you are better off looking elsewhere.  But if you spend a day with it, you will know why they have designed it that way.  The controls are very intuitive.If you have the money to splurge.  Offer no apologies to anyone as they can only salivate to patronize a Leica.  If you are the sensible kind, you know where to go as this isn't for the faint of heart in the ever-changing, fast depreciating digital world of electronics and gadgets.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Only for diehard Leica-brand fans", "Author": "jasmine park", "ReviewID": "RA3J0UEK16970", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using & loving my Leica Digilux 1 for years, the Digilux 3 seemed like the perfect step-up to the DSLR world.  The lens is fantastic & has been winning rave reviews, & I'm a big fan of the camera's analog controls & the retro body styling.  After a week of using the Digilux 3 extensively while travelling, I'm extremely happy with my choice; the image stabilization, the bounce flash, the aperture ring on the lens, & the Live Preview LCD are all excellent features.  But buyer beware: There's basically no way to justify getting the D3 over its Panasonic twin, the DMC-L1, which Costco was selling for literally half the price of the D3 during this X-Mas holiday.  Despite the excellent lens, the L1 is about the right price for this camera, which makes the D3 a plain rip-off; almost any camera pro would tell you your money would be better spent on a Nikon D200 or Canon 30D, w/ hundreds to spare on lenses.  Despite this, I've managed to justify the extra cost of the D3 on strictly emotional/nostalgic terms - for everything that the Leica brand evokes & for how aesthetically pleasing the D3 is.  But I'll be the first to admit that these aren't very compelling reasons, & would point most other buyers to the L1 instead.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "An outstanding camera for serious photographers", "Author": "Thomas R. Diaz \"T Diaz\"", "ReviewID": "R2EYMG649ILQRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Leica version of this camera after getting Leica's offer of a $[...] rebate, making it closer in price to the Panasonic version.  I use Leica rangefinders and will perhaps benefit from the JPG tweaks that are special the the Leica version.  Most of my remarks would probably apply to the Panasonic edition, though.This camera and lens replaced a Canon 20D kit with a similar IS zoom lens.  In other words, the Leica replaced an excellent SLR with roughly the same resolution (8.x megapixels, versus 7.5 megapixels on the Leica).I have been pleased in every way with the Vario-Elmarit lens, which is as sharp as I would expect for a Leica-branded lens.  The controls (both on the lens and the top-mounted shutter speed dial) are very nice and familiar for an RF user like me.The body is larger and \"blockier\" than a Leica rangefinder, as are all SLRs.  However, I am excited that this 4/3 mount camera not only comes with an excellent lens (I think better than the Canon 17-85mm it replaced) but also gives me access to quite a few fine 4/3 lenses, such as the Olympus macro and telephoto lenses.A couple of camera body features that I like a great deal and, in my opinion, are better than the Canon:1. Nicely designed built-in flash that first comes up in \"bounce\" position and then on a second button-press moves into \"straight-ahead\" position.  It fits flush into the body when not in use.2. VERY accessible and easy to use control for adjusting flash power for fill flash and similar applications.3. Equally accessible and easy to use back-panel control for exposure compensation--important on any digital camera, since you will want to dial back in sunlit and other contrasty scenes to avoid blown-out highlights!4. Top-mounted MECHANICAL switches for shutter speed, sequence/single shooting, and metering mode, plus two preset buttons, are always there, always visible--no waiting for or squinting at an LCD display.5. Lately I have not done much macro shooting, but I do like it.  I expect to use the live view feature with all its strangeness. (The camera does two mirror-blips per exposure in this mode.) It beats hunching down on the ground photographing insects with a right-angle viewfinder.As much as I liked the Canon 20D and 30D I used to use, I think this camera is better designed for easy and fast shooting.I was going to say this is a camera for photographers at all levels.  However, I will still likely use my Leica rangefinders for professional work.  That's not a slam on the Digilux 3.  The Canon 20D and 30D occupied about the same position in my mind--if I were using a DSLR for professional work I might want a higher end camera for more ruggedness, better dirt sealing, and so on.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Impressive, But Expensive, Leica Entry in Four Thirds Digital SLR Photography", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "RBDN6P1VG60EB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently I read a most impressive review of this digital SLR camera and its zoom lens in the pages of Popular Photography. But this isn't the sole reason why I would consider purchasing one. I've been fortunate to handle the camera and lens a few times lately, and have been quite impressed with how well this camera handles. It truly feels more like an overgrown 35mm Leica rangefinder camera than a digital SLR, well-balanced with both hands gripping onto the camera and lens. Indeed, it it truly designed as a digital SLR for the active photographer interested in photographing moving objects, judging from its relatively narrow ISO range from 100 to 1600 (This is a range suited ideally for the sports or other action-oriented photographer.). And yet how well this camera handles isn't my best reason for getting one. Optically its performance is absolutely stellar, at least at lower ISO speeds, yielding crisp images with superb contrast and resolution (The Leica D 14-50mm f2.8-3.5 ASPH lens yielded a performance, that according to Popular Photography, was outstanding, and much better than other digital SLR zoom lenses of similar focal lengths, due not only to its superb Leica-designed optical formula, but also to its digital imaging stabilizer.).With the Leica Digilux 3, Leica - and its partner Panasonic - have officially become the latest member of the digital four-thirds system pioneered by Sigma and embraced too by Olympus (EDITORIAL NOTE: I erred in assuming that Sigma had pioneered the digital four-thirds system, which the comment (see below) by another customer notes correctly. However, contrary to what he has written, it was developed jointly by both Kodak and Olympus. I have had several opportunities to use this camera and have been quite impressed with its performance.). This means that potential users of the Leica Digilux 3 can use too superb lenses made by both firms, most notably the Olympus 50mm f2 macro lens. Both Leica and Panasonic have promised additional Leica lenses for its four-thirds digital SLRs (The term \"four-thirds\" refers to the image ratio that's obtainable from the camera's digital imaging sensor; other image formats, including the standard three two from 35mm photography are also available.); I have no doubt that optically their performances will be second to none. And yet, the unanswered question is whether this new digital four thirds SLR camera and its Leica-designed zoom lens are well worth the expense in acquiring them. I think the answer is a most definite yes if you are seeking the highest possible optical quality from a four-thirds digital SLR.", "Date": "December 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "The definition of a quality digital SLR - built & lens - A1", "Author": "M. Sallai", "ReviewID": "R21IGHQ0X9OST2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "German Design/engineering & Japanese Manufacturing what more could you ask for? Totally different photographic experience,especially tactile experience (aperature ring on lens). The camera has a solid built & mechanics/switches not like these other plastic cameras. Lens is a solid perfomer (no distortions) and plenty of detail captured and no visible noise up to ISO 400. ISO 800 also usable. Flash very good for close shots and mid-range otherwise recommend Olympus FL-50 flash (over expensive Pana-flash FL500). I have never taken so many photos previously - initially noticed weight and size but not any more - feels good in the hands - hey I am really proud of this little marvel.If you know about photography then you know that most people will not need more than 7.5MP (ignore pixel race and consider print sizes needed). I highly recommend this camera. Quality, fast, feels good, easy to use and great quality pics. I prefer the Leica over Pana model extra Leica warranty is worth the difference (warranties always cost, peace of mind), better  software & support service plus I think better looking too.

How can a Leica digital camera, ( the Digilux 3) that I bought a year ago go from $1,200 go to $3999.?????  It has good ratings, but not great. It is not a collectors item. I think it is not a bad camera for 7.5 MP but my Nikon D-90, new at the same price,is the same price new, and much better, I say that mindfully as I love Leicas.. well... you'd expect a bit more from a Leica.But the main thing is, how could you let it be sold less that a year ago for $1200, then jack it up to $4000.?  It's interesting, I sent it back for a repair, and they decided to refund my money, not repair it. ( very simple repair)  They said there were no more being made/available.

I have found myself coming back to reviews and checking prices since that time. My first SLR was a Canon AE1 and I enjoyed using it but moved to digital in 1999.I know that the Leica carries a higher price tag but I managed to get one in very nice condition for not much more than the going rate for the L1.I have other digital cameras full frame, four thirds and prosumer compact and they have their jobs to do.Anyway I have taken over 400 shots in the last two weeks and I am really enjoying using, viewing and printing form this camera. It good access to all the functions I need and I like the aperture ring and shutter dial. It is not light and the viewfinder cannot compare to the 5DII. I have printed up to A2 from RAW and with a little sharpening tweak they look fine which suprised me a previously I did not print to A2 with less than 10Mpixels.The lens is great but the pictures in jpeg can be a little soft. Raw is fine at 800 iso with work but 1600 needs more work and only for small prints or maybe larger black and white.If you are thinking of buying this camera I would encourage you to do so especially now the prices are low for good second hand ones.RegardsGW", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's not a Leica....", "Author": "JOHN A.
