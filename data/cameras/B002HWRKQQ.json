overlooking the main channel on January 28, 2010. The river was swollen from melting snow. High winds played havoc with the tiny camera microphone, distorting the sound.Olympus Stylus 7010 12MP Digital Camera with 7x ZoomI've taken thousands of photos with my Nikon DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex), but my wife won't touch it because \"it's too big and complicated\".  So, we bought this tiny Olympus for her.Pros:- Camera is capable of taking excellent photos.- Smaller than a pack of cigarettes, the 7010 is easily carried on your belt, in a purse, your pocket, a car's storage bin, etc.  In its case on your belt, someone might think it's a cell phone.  There are smaller cameras available, but not with the features (such as the 7x zoom) of this model.- Automatic lens guard.  When the camera is off, the lens is protected from dust, fingers, or objects touching it.  Turn the camera on and within a half second, the lens extends and the lens guard opens.  Cameras without this built-in protection are much more likely to collect dust on the lens.- The optical zoom (to 7x) is astounding for such a tiny camera.  On the other hand, landscapes or other wide-angle scenes are quite doable with no zoom.  (Of course, the built-in image stabilization is mandatory for high-zoom shots.)  The telephoto lens moves very quickly at the touch of a button, almost too quickly; but at least you don't have to wait.- Excellent, sharp, 2.7\" LCD screen to view scenes, images/movies taken, menus, etc.- On the AUTO setting, the camera selects shutter speed, ISO, white balance, flash/no flash, etc., which is what my wife wanted.  All you do is point, and shoot.  On the P setting, you can \"program\" those variables, and other options; then, you can then quickly switch the mode dial between AUTO, P, and built-in scene settings, while walking around.- The \"movie\" setting is used to capture a moving scene with sound (but it's a far cry from even a rudimentary camcorder).  It couldn't be easier.  Select \"movie\",  zoom if you want, and press the shutter \"release\".  When done, press the shutter release again.  You can't change the zoom once you start shooting a movie.- The battery seems to handle a couple of hundred shots, but that depends on how the camera is used.  If it's used a lot on a vacation for example, you should do a recharge daily.- Has many other features too numerous to go into, such as macro & super macro (extreme closeup), panorama stitched shots, connection to a TV for viewing images, many scene settings, controls that light up at night (for a second or two), etc.- There's only a slight delay on startup or when taking a photo.- Construction quality is excellent.Cons:- In spite of the \"dual image stabilization\" feature, out-of-focus photos are too common.  Of course, holding the camera as still as possible (or supported), not \"jerking\" the shutter release, etc.,  helps enormously -- not to mention good lighting.  Although she took many excellent shots, a fifth of the photos my wife took on a recent vacation were  noticeably blurred.  In addition, far too many indoor flash photos are also less than ideally focused (or too dark), so multiple attempts may be required.  It could be me, but I find it harder to hold a tiny camera steady versus a large DSLR; so perhaps part of the focus issue is user \"error\".- On the AUTO setting during a sunny day, over-exposure (too bright) of part of a scene frequently occurs if some subjects are in a shaded area and others are in the sunshine.  (I'm possibly being too critical here, but my DSLR handles this situation much better.)- Buttons and controls are really tiny, especially if you have large hands.Other:- 12 MP images at normal compression are around 2,600 KB each, so a 2 GB picture card will hold about 750 photos.  A 30 second movie consumes about 10 MB.Summary:Put the Olympus on your short list if you want a really small camera with an excellent image-stabilized zoom, for not too much money.  It's also a good backup camera when a big DSLR is impractical to carry.  In fact, it's so easy to carry around, you might want to take it wherever you go.  In spite of the occasional focus issues, I gave it 4 stars because of its extensive features and relatively low price.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Matthew D. White \"Smilen\"", "ReviewID": "R9XY0RJ96ZXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanted to purchase a compact camera with a larger zoom and more mega pixels then my old 6mp Fuji.  I was hesitant because this is a new model from Olympus and there were no reviews. This camera works great, plenty of features and great pictures.  The panoramic is really nice and the 640 x 480 video option is good quality for a digital camera even though it disables the zoom function.  With the zoom extended (7X) pictures are occasionally not as sharp.  After owning the camera for a week I'm very pleased with it.  The 8 gig micro sd card holds about 1000 pics at 12mp (fine) or 25 minutes of video.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Ember", "ReviewID": "R2FDNDO05HOP0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really impressive camera, especially for the price, and I'm surprised it doesn't have more reviews. I was taking a trip and looking for the best combination of small size, maximum MP, long zoom, and picture quality - and this little guy has it all.First off, it's little. Not the smallest or thinnest camera I looked at, but easily the smallest with a 7x zoom. And that zoom is wonderful. It's also much faster than most of the other cameras I tested. The zoom is zippy and the camera itself only takes about one second to start up after you hit the button. The 12MP is great for high-res images. Also, as advertised, this camera's image stabilization makes it very good at taking shots of moving objects. There isn't much shutter lag time. The camera has both macro and \"super macro\" modes which take amazing extreme close-ups. It has a very wide angle and can connect images to make a panorama.Potential cons: There is no viewfinder. The LCD is crystal clear, though. The buttons on the back are a little inelegant; they seem clunky to me. But they light up, a big plus at night!This is the perfect camera for someone who wants premium features at a relatively low cost. I looked at 10MP, 3x zoom cameras that cost $100 more than this one, and I still can't figure out how that cost is justified. This is a super point-and-shoot for casual and intermediate photographers.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing value!!", "Author": "Kalina T.", "ReviewID": "R2ZRRU7NVGRUZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took my time before writing this review because I wanted to be sure I used the camera enough to form a solid opinion.  My conclusion is that this camera is an amazing value.  I shopped around both online and at various stores and I couldn't find any 12 megapixel camera with this much (7X) zoom for anywhere near the price I ultimately paid for this one.I took it on a very important vacation trip where we went to two concerts, took it to a gourmet luncheon put on by the Culinary Dept. of the local college, etc. etc.  I also tested it against my old Sony 3X (which I still love).  The Olympus produced excellent photos and compared favorably up against the Sony Cybershot.  It's amazingly compact for a 7X zoom and lighter and thinner than the Sony 3X.Perhaps that reviewer who gave it 1 star didn't read the manual?  I can't understand how someone could take over a thousand photos and get 10 decent ones.  I took about 100 and the few that got tossed were my fault, not the camera's.  I'm very happy with this camera!", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "varnav", "ReviewID": "R3HCXXWK40LLRR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I remember those point-and-shoot Olympus digital cameras from mid 2000s - great images with click of a button. That's what I was expecting - and got disappointed. The picture quality is even worse that my old Canon A60 (from year 2003) makes.The biggest problem is - megapixels. Too many. Many megapixels combined with small sensor area in compact cameras result in very much noise at dark. The camera images are too noisy in any indoor environment, even at relatively low 400 ISO and even with flash! In other hand stabilizer is good - indoor images are sharp, but noisy.And will you ever need all those 12 megapixels? I doubt. Will you get noisy images because of them? Sure. But this is marketing.And, the worst thing - you may lower the megapixel setting in the camera - but sensor will still be the same high-resolution high-noise one.The second big big problem is proprietary standards. The cable and connector look like mini-USB, but they are actually some kind of special Olympus-only connector. You may, fortunately, use micro-SD card (not only inferior xD) with this camera - but it is connected unusual way through the special adapter.And compact size has it's drawbacks - it's hard to hold the camera in hand but it's easy to accidentally close flash with your finger. buttons are tiny even for my small hands.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, 7X Compact Just What I wanted", "Author": "R.

After using the 7010 for two months, the auto point and shoot works quickly, the wide-angle and panoramic modes produce very good pics, and the low-light flash shots are good from 15ft or less.Comparing the 7010 to my older digicams, the resolution does not \"seem\" to be quite 12MP sharpness, nor does the zoom \"seem\" to be quite 7X, but for $180 this camera is just what I wanted for a compact, mainly point & shoot.

Mindham \"Terry Mindham\"", "ReviewID": "R3TXUNEUNYTFKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Olympus 7010 to replace my Canon S2 IS with 5 mega pixels and a 12x tele lens (bought in '05 to replace a 3 meg that succumbed to the sand in Iraq). While I loved the Canon's 12x, 5 megs just doesn't get it any more, and the Olympus is so much more compact. I'm an avid mountain hiker, and it's nice to have a 12 mega camera, super thin, that attaches to my belt for quick access. Other 'musts' with the Olympus are that it has image stabization, panoramic ability, and a 7x tele lens. Most point-and-shoots only have a 4x lens and that's not good enough (like getting closeups of sheep in Scotland a couple years ago).  While I am also in the market for a good mid-level SLR digital, like the Nikon D90(had four SLR 35mm's in my previous life), this little gem will long have a place in my travel plans. I currently have my house on the market to sell myself, and the Olympus's 28mm wide angle lens took some all-inclusive shots indoors that I just couldn't achieve with the older Canon.  This uber-wonder by Olympus packs so many excellent features in such a small package that I couldn't resist making it a necessity. To me, there just wasn't any legitimate competition for under $160 (via Amazon) or even $200.  When size matters (small), this camera is the one.

This 7010 has an amazing number of features for such a small package. The 7x zoom is what really impressed me (equiv to 28mm-196mm in the old 35mm format)because most compact digitals in this price range only offer a 3x or 4x, plus 12mp, image stabilization, and the ability to take panoramic pictures. I've found that it also takes great shots in low light. I travel often, and regularly hike and bicycle, which makes the compact package the perfect size. I also love the 28mm wide angle, which is wider than my old Canon S2 IS.

Office Depot? Not sure.). The 7x optical zoom is almost impossible to find at this price point, so I couldn't pass this one up.Be extremely careful with the battery- the first time, I inserted it the wrong way and almost pulled off part of it trying to get it back out. Despite this, it still works (when inserted correctly), but the battery edge is a little loose. Totally not the camera or battery's fault, 100% mine.I was...very disappointed with the camera when I first used it. The pictures looked grainy and dark, even with excellent lighting (on the Auto setting). I never transferred the pictures to my laptop, but now I realize it is possibly the LCD screen's fault. However, after playing around with the settings on the \"P\" mode and customizing them to \"Hi2\" (High-speed 2), 3m->fine, ISO Auto, and no flash (this camera has the worst flash ever), I soon had an excellent camera in my hands. Sure, the high speed mode takes multiple pictures, but it's a nuisance I'll put up with when I have superb pictures.This camera comes with a cable to connect it to a computer, but if all you want to do is import pictures, I highly recommend getting a card adapter/reader. If you use the cable, it drains the camera's battery. This camera died on me while I had connected it to the computer.Which brings me to another point- battery life. The battery life isn't the best. It won't last a whole day of taking pictures frequently (like if you're sight-seeing or on vacation or something), so I recommend buying an extra battery.I use the XD-microSD card adapter that came with this camera. I rarely see XD cards in stores anymore, so I stick with the microSD cards. A lot of microSDs conveniently come with SD card adapters, and my laptop comes with a built-in SD card reader (as do many laptops, nowadays) so that works out fabulously.The macro and super-macro modes are great, and work very well. I can take a very clear picture of the fabric of my jeans when the camera lens is about 5 mm above it.I don't really use the SCN mode often, since the customized \"P\" mode is fantastic. However, the Sunset mode is really nice for taking pictures of lights or sunsets, since it won't give you that annoying line of light across the picture. The beauty mode is a nice touch, but I don't use it often and honestly, I don't see much of a difference between the original picture and the edited one.The camcorder sucks. It won't let you zoom in and out while recording, and the little microphone records fuzzy sounds. But I didn't buy it for the camcorder (I have a real one for that), so I'm okay with that.

I love the automatic setting; great for the casual user who wants to capture a scene as it happens without needing to reset from panorama to macro or flash to natural light. When you wish to set up a shot the different scene settings are easy to find.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera for the price", "Author": "M.

Well, it turns out they have an agreement with the UPS Store and a have an account.  The UPS Store even packages it.

We were happy to find this model that is so loaded with features for a very reasonable price.  I find the camera relatively intuitive to use as well as portable.  I also like the large, brightly lit display.  Unfortunately, a high percentage of photos - even those taken in bright light - seem to be slightly out of focus.  This is especially true when I am taking photos of my kids, who are of course always in motion.  I have found that I need to take many many photos to ensure that a few will be in focus.
