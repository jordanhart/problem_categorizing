It started to freeze up nd could only be turned off or on by removing batteries.I sent it for repair at Nikon authorized center and was quickly told that this defect is not covered under warranty and will cost $99.00 to repair.I strongly advise against the purchase of this series since I spoke to many coolpix owners and found out they have problems as well.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dynamite!  An amzaing piece of engineering and design", "Author": "Heavyrunner", "ReviewID": "R1W5TK8H7QUT2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a pro photographer specializing in scenic imaging that is sold at the National Parks in the American Southwest.  My products feature 360 degree VR photography in Flash and Quicktime.  I often volunteer to take pictures of families and other groups of people at the Parks with their cameras so they can all be in a picture.  So I have been handling these cool little point and shoot cameras, and I have seen the great pictures they take when my friends come back from trips and put on slide shows.  So I decided the mini point and shoots have evolved enough so I should get one and experiment with using it for my work sometimes.  I bought a top of the line, 12.5 mp Fujifilm FinePix F100fd.  I returned it after one week.  The pictures were muddy and had to be downsized to about 5 mp before they were sharp enough to use.  And the \"manual\" controls just didn't cut it.So I ordered the Nikon S710 in deep red to try next.  It is a great little camera!  The design is brilliant.  It is a tiny work of art.  I love it and you will too!  I use Nikon SLR and DSLR cameras all the time, and the controls on this tiny point and shoot S710 work exactly the same as the controls on my expensive DSLR Nikons.  The color out of this little camera is spot on, and the images are sharp and very much usable at the highest resolution, 14.5 mp!  I like the lens.  It can't match full size Nikon lenses for regular FX (35 mm) cameras, but it's pretty close.  The high iso capabilities of the S710 are good.  The vibration filtering works great and you can get some beautiful photos in low light situations with no tripod.  I bought a mini tripod with the camera for $5 that works fine and got a nice, two tone burgundy and black case from LowePro for $15 that holds the camera, an extra battery and SDHC card, and the tiny tripod carries great slid through the belt loop, so I have a pretty complete kit that weighs less than a pound and fits in a pocket!The ergonomics are superior and the camera feels natural in my big hands and its comfortable to hold and keeping my fingers away from the flash is just automatic.  The buttons and select wheel work and feel just right and the menus in icon mode make sense and work intuitively.The only thing I would suggest Nikon do to improve the camera is to provide a firmware update that allows you to save images in RAW format.Some reviewers have complained about the camera being slow.  It seems plenty fast to me and I have not found its speed an issue.  The case is stainless steel and the finish has proved very durable so far and looks great!  I love this camera and take it with me everywhere I go.  I am flying to Chicago in a couple of weeks to see Etta James and go to a Cubs game and this kit is the only camera I am taking along.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "The perfect digital camera", "Author": "Cajundego \"Cajundego\"", "ReviewID": "RPEE1DNVBC680", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a D-SLR that I use on a regular basis since photography is my hobby.

I was out shooting wildflowers early this spring of 2012. When I crouched down to shoot a Desert Indian Paintbrush closeup in macro mode, the camera slipped out of my hand. I had not put the wrist strap over my hand onto my wrist and the camera dropped about 6 inches, but it landed on solid granite, lens barrel first at an angle. That was enough to generate \"lens error.\" So be very careful and don't drop your S710 at all when the lens is extended. Apparently they are very fragile in that configuration.I sent the camera in for repair, and I have been charged $87 and the web site says they are replacing my camera with a new unit. I haven't received it yet, but I assume I will, which is a great deal. The case was starting to show some wear in the beautiful red finish so it will be nice to get a completely new unit.If you use manual settings, this is the point and shoot to have. I looked around for a replacement camera and I wasn't able to find another with the manual controls of the S710.

It will only cause you headache later on.Unfortunately, I had the same lens error that many many others have experienced due to Nikon's defective product.  Here's my story:  I had the lens error since day 1.  It normally fixed itself after an hour.  The last time, the lens unit would not retract into the camera, and it was rendered useless so I finally sent it in to be repaired - covered by warranty.  Nikon just got back to me telling me my camera was \"damaged\" and therefore, the warranty voided, and that if I want my camera fixed, I owe them $87.00. I never dropped or otherwise damaged this camera.  I believe that what they're referring to is a scratch on the front, caused by taking the camera out of my purse, and putting it back away.  I will not be spending $87.00 for another defective lens unit, so I now need to purchase a new camera.It's unfortunate that they are getting away with such poor customer service.

Calvert", "ReviewID": "R18O7RFMK4CWKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cnet etc is right - that 14mb image takes 4 sec to process - but what fun to have that giant image to crop just the way you like. I'm 5 baby Nikons into my digital photo life and the 710 is far and away my favorite. Gorgeous sensitivity - you can turn off that flash and get the shot, it wakes up in < 1 sec, focuses fast, has a reasonable set of aperture, shutter and manual controls. The program mode is a bit simplified - really just 5 or 6 aperture/shutter combinations - but it's serviceable. I also have a P5000 (for work) and the S710 lacks the P5000's amazing macro capabilities. I suppose this is due to the (very lovely to have) wide angle lens - so minimum focus distance is 10 inches - but again the 14mb comes to the rescue. Shot and crop for a descent close up. And those ugly purple fringes on tree limbs against the sky - they are gone - nice glass on this little one.Still getting used to handling this small machine which lacks the grips of the P5000 and all the other Nikons I've used - so I make sure to slip the strap over the wrist. But small means you carry it always and everywhere - which is the point, no?

Unfortunately, we were stuck overseas and couldn't return the camera until it was too late. The particles/dust are there to stay and we won't be able to take them out unless we send the camera to Nikon or for professional cleaning (which is way too expensive to do for an ultra-compact camera). The problem is getting only worse, at this point the camera is becoming unusable due to a large number of photo artifacts from the particles trapped inside the lens or between the lens and sensor. We never had this problem before using other compact cameras we own (we have 2 Sony cameras and one Olympus). Our Sony DSC-P150 was even dropped down some pretty steep steps and still continued to operate normally without a hint of any artifacts. This camera was treated in a much more careful fashion and still managed to get particles inside. I can only blame flimsy construction for that.We also had problems with occasional lens error messages and camera getting stuck in mid zoom like others reported.2) The camera is extremely slow for a quick point-and-shoot. We are not photographers and use this mostly in auto mode and scene mode. It takes a while to switch it on and make it ready to take photos, but that's something we can deal with. The worst is the fact that the camera takes forever to focus which makes it very easy to miss important shots. It's also more prone to take blurry photos. Our old Sony P-150 is super-fast and snappy when it comes to auto-focusing and taking the quick shots.3) Photo quality is ok, pictures taken in bright light sometimes need exposure under-compensation, otherwise they turn out overly highlighted. Sharpness of pictures isn't as good as I would expect from a camera with 14mp. The images are softer than what we get from our old Sony camera and when enlarged to full resolution appear blurry. It doesn't feel the camera takes advantage of 14mp at all.The good points about this camera:1) Although it's definitely not the slimmest camera around it's still pretty compact to fit into a small pocket while providing wide-angle capability, which is very useful for group portraits, landscapes and real estate. We bought it specifically because we wanted an ultra-compact that would have a wide angle and at that time (a year ago) this was the only camera on the market like this.2) Pictures have nice color, the color rendition is better than what we get on a Sony camera.3) Nice night shots - it's not difficult to take acceptable night portraits and night shots even if you don't use tripod or any other stabilizing device. This feature is much nicer on Nikon than on our old Sony camera which is unable to take any night time pictures without excessive blurring.Even if we didn't have dust particle artifacts on our photos, I wouldn't be satisfied with this camera's performance due to slowness and soft blurry images. But now, it's pretty much useless unless you are into photoshopping black spots in each and every photo. Nikon needs to take this sad and flimsy model off the market, there is too much competition out there now for compact wide angle and even super-zoom cameras. Personally, I don't trust Nikon's reputation as a superb quality camera manufacturer after experience with this product and would never buy another Coolpix or other compact from them again.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera review", "Author": "scribner \"more photos\"", "ReviewID": "RUUZCBK4KHSSL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera and easy to use.
