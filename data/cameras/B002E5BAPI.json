If you want one of these things, do as I did and find a dealer that you can TALK TO FIRST then be prepared to pay more.... run fast from this one!

Also made of cheap plastic, not metal alloy as described. It is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made in amazon. Seller said to conact amazon. Save your money and your mental health and see other options. Bought one through ebay that was great, solid metal construction and also cheaper. I feel robbed.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for L.E.", "Author": "Dave McGhee", "ReviewID": "R3CB2B2YSFNEQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picked this up as a CYA for Law Enforcement work.  Works great and not too many people catch on.  The VOX feature only works when you are out of the car due to constant radio traffic.  Doesn't work too well in very low temps due to battery.Pros:  Very small size, not very noticeable, decent sound and video quality.  Works with Mac and Windows...  Separates files automatically so you don't have to go through every one to find the video you are looking for.  Subtle LED lights let you know it's working or what mode it's in.  The Price Is Right...Cons:  VOX picks up every sound and activates with radio traffic (small gripe).  No instant review or way to rewind and check something without using a computer.  Battery length is limiting factor however expect at least and hour or two of record time on a full charge...  Needs a time/date stamp feature....  The clip looks flimsy however it has lasted a monthOverall:  If you are doing Law Enforcement and not lucky enough to have an in car camera/mic, then get this camera.  The fact that you wear the camera means your video goes where you go and sees what you see and hears what you hear.  You car camera will still be looking at the rear end of the car you pulled over while this one with be with you on the foot chase.  Great for defense against bogus complaints from dumb crooks.  Good for covert ops and can be used as a nanny cam.  Great for mountain biking and hiking too.  It's not waterproof though so don't try to use it in the rain or water.  I have recommended it to fellow LEO's.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Small digital video camera", "Author": "Tech Engineer \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R56E0M0V21YTV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great action camera for biking, skateboard, snowboard or just recording others 'as they are' when they don't know you are recording.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "D.
