{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent features, price and quality photographs!", "Author": "Savvy shopper \"Andi\"", "ReviewID": "R3HYB749RCSPBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchase the Nikon Coolpix L20 after lots of shopping.I have used only Olympus cameras only up to now.This time I wanted a smaller pocket sized camera, that still took the AA batteries, and that still gave great photos with all the features I was used to.This camera fit the bill!It takes 2 AA batteries, inexpensive SD memory cards and yet still delivers fantastic photos.I have already tried all the features, and was completly happy.I love using the different scene settings, and could not live without the video feature.Both still and video capture worked well in both bright light and low light.The sound playback via the camera is hard to distinquish (live music), but fine once uploaded.I didn't really require the smile feature, but tried it out on my 3 year old, and was blown away....it really works!The blink feature is also quite ingenious.  The camera actually asks you if your subject blinked when they do, but not when they don't.  This is particularly handy when taking photos of children.  I would have loved this feature when I was still my daughter's yearbook photographer.What can I say, fabulous price and awesome quality!!!Definately worth the money.Comparibly priced camera's that we have used, produce grainy shots.....but have not found this with this camera at all.I would recommend this camera to anyone!", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unless you need a really long-lens telephoto and billboard sized prints, this is the perfect camera for every use", "Author": "C. Scanlon \"least helpful reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "RYGIL7U0NX8C2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a professional camera capable of crystal clear prints worthy of publication or gallery display, up to 16x20.And it is incredibly inexpensive for a camera of such value.Ok, so its 3.6 optical zoom won't pick sand off an eagle's beak at a thousand yards. Okay, so it won't blow up to billboard size without loss of definition. In the real world however and everyday use this is a fine and professional level camera that will do a far better job than you expected. Better than a cell-phone.Disguised as a point and shoot. That's what makes it very effective; people are not intimidated by it. You can get right up to them, and it looks like any other camera. Yet, it is more.In fact, the generous three inch LCD screen means you do not have to hold it to your face. There is no optical viewfinder in any case. So you can hold it at your hip and glance down at it to compose, and snap shots while engaging the subject in small talk comfortably. I have done this effectively with Tarahumara Indian children in northern Chihuahua who normally run quickly from any camera. It works, and came out great. And that large LCD screen has a high-contrast, anti-reflection coating which keeps it clear even in strong sunlight.This camera is an improvement over the earlier, wonderful Coolpix, such as the great 8 megapix Nikon Coolpix L18 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Ruby Red) mainly because it has ten megapix capability. The earlier accessories such as the AC adapter, the  Nikon EH-65A AC Adapter, are transferable if you have a long shoot to do in one place (like a schoolful of children, which I have done) or other reason to go off-battery. Nevertheless, a pair of Energizer\u00ae e<sup>2</sup>\u00ae \"AA\" Lithium Batteries For digital cameras, portable audio players, and more last in here last forever.Your old Coolpix camera pouch also still fits; use it and protect your investment. I like the Rokinon Compact Digital Camera Padded Carrying Case for Canon Powershot, Casio Exilim, Fuji Finepix, (GE) General Electric, Kodak EasyShare, Nikon Coolpix, Olympus FE Stylus, Panasonic Lumix, Pentax Optio, Sony CyberShot and Samsung Digital Cameras.Also new here, aside from the greater megapixels, is the new Expeed image processing system specially fine-tuned for the Coolpix series \"to render natural-looking pictures of incredible quality and quick response\" as if the earlier system of digital processing was not fine enough! Amateur enthusiasts will find their photos reaching a new magnitude of quality; even the professional will leave his camera bag and lenses at home (okay, so she might miss her long lens, but macro here gets in to two inches).The ISO settings are phenomenal, stretching from 64 ISO all  the way out to 1600. Over twenty years ago when I was doing photo-journalism in Nicaragua, we used 64 for our slide film and 1600 was just coming on the horizon, very grainy but with a special charm for low light situations, like oil lamp, etc. Here you can do very low light and candlelight  (if you do not mind some grain effect), and in fact there are special pre-sets which employ the faster ISO's effectively.This is another expansion over the prior Coolpix L series. You can choose instead of Auto (with own its user-selected options) to use the pre-set \"Scene\" selections quickly and efficiently. The Scene modes now include: Portrait, Night Portrait, Sports, Landscape, Party, Beach/Snow, Sunset, Dusk/Dawn, Night Landscape, Museum, Fireworks Show, Close Up, Copy, Back Light, Panorama Assist, Food. Food is one of the new ones, and you food photo-journalists might want to try it very inexpensively yet quite well here. The rest of the modes you can figure how they are set from the title and how you might apply their settings to similar situations; know that the Nikon impression of party might be much more sedate and candle-lit than the Animal House idea. This is not cheating, to use pre-sets; this is using the tool that you have in the way it was designed. Cheating would be setting this to its auto-scene setting in which it selects the Scene mode according toprevailing conditions, automatically. Yes, this can do it.The panorama assist is great. You can take a series of photos in a row in either of four directions (left to right, up and down, etc.) overlapping by one third (I really appreciate the rule of thirds grid which you can bring up on the LCD, keeping the camera straight and well composed), and then unite them with the included software into one long (or tall) file. I had reason to do this the other day at a long new school. Things do not build vertical out here in the desert, but there is plenty of room for horizontal, and a special Cinerama style long photo framing. In fact you could line up your whole town along the sidewalk standing and take one long photo of everyone in town. Just find printer and paper!With the built in macro mode you can jump right into that cactus blossom from two inches away and have perfect focus. Take a photo of that baby's toes and blow them up to 16x20. Come in close to that ant stealing cracker crumbs on your picnic. This strength of macro was recently unimaginable, and yet here you have this power within a humble, tiny and inexpensive package.What I really love and appreciate is the SDHC compliancy. I can use as standard memory card a regular Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader) and have room for 500 shots at maximum resolution. You can truly, as we used to say a quarter century ago \"shoot a roll; keep a shot.\"  Take all of the shots you can, and then pick one out to use and delete the rest. For someone who used to burn through boxes of film (at 36 shots each max) and then do the darkroom processing all night, and then find a free way to get more, this is like living in another, finer dimension. Of course, you can put even larger SD HC memory cards in here and if you ever do fill one up and have nothing more to put in there and no time to delete, this camera comes with a generous 20MB internal memory on hand.You can hook it up to the USB port of a computer directly and use the included software, or simply pop out the SD card and plug it into a reader and into the computer. Whatever works for you, although I do not like opening and closing the battery/card hatch too much. It is very strong and durable, but in the olden days I had a habit of snapping such things and putting them back together with duct tape. This one looks remarkably resilient nevertheless and has stood up to me.Speaking of shooting a roll to get the one picture, have you ever taken a shot to discover your subject blinked? This camera lets you know. Yes, this camera sees when your subject blinks, and lets you know, using the Smart Portrait system. It also automatically fixes your red-eye special. You'll never see red eye again. It finds faces, and automatically focuses on them, up to a dozen at a time. It can also snap the shutter automatically when someone finally dares to smile. And the D-lighting will save those details otherwise lost in darkness.As you can see, this camera does everything for you but serve as photo agency selling your work to Vogue or GQ. A great camera at a small price. What can go wrong?The most amazing thing for me, of course, an old still shooter, is that this tiny camera is also a video camera, with built in mike, and a built in speaker for playback. You can make movies with this at two different resolutions, either for television playback at 640x480 or laptop at 320x240 (good for e-mailing). These home movies are truly sharp, with the same excellent back to front focus as the photos, and surprisingly high quality sound. The length of the movie is limited only to the size of your SDHC card; you could easily go for feature length! Using .AVI files, it can easily be edited as well.Of course, this camera comes with the standard sized screw input for mounting on a tripod. I have used it on my Targus 66-inch heavy-duty tripod. Looks a little small up there, but it works great. You will really appreciate the steadiness a tripod always brings, and the freedom, no less with this great camera, which so thoughtfully has a tripod screw-in.Hey, for the same price, this is way better than a cell phone!Too bad this one is so, well, red!", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent Starter Camera", "Author": "Jerry D.

But I couldn't help but come to the rescue of this highly misunderstood product. Too much negative reviews for a product that actually delivers, IMO. I bought this item as a gift for my 11 year old daughter. Then when I looked at most of the reviews here, my heart sank. Should I have researched more? But being that hard headed as I am. Plus I don't like the headache of returning things, that I have already bought. I investigated more and really tested this product. First off, I noticed that mostly first time camera users seemed to have no problem with this camera (like a reviewer's fifth grader here or a grandpa). So what seems to be the problem? Okay, I found out this - most of us have been used to other digital cameras where you half pressed first on the shutter to focus before you press all the way and shoot. Well this camera has what you call an easy auto mode - wherein the camera does everything for you including focusing. With easy auto mode, it is just that - easy - just point, camera does it's job and shoot right away. Let the camera focus for you (it actually makes a sound) and once it does that then just shoot away. Don't even half press anymore and \"wala\" - very sharp pictures that even a fifth grader and grandpa could take. I have found out that in easy auto mode and then I half press to focus or don't click right away after the camera focuses - pictures come out so blurry. But, wow! Just follow what I say and the pictures are so sharp. The camera also has the standard auto mode, wherein you could half press first to focus (if you're used to that), and the pictures still come out so sharp. So there you go, this camera I highly recommend and is a good point and shoot camera that takes really sharp pictures. Don't believe me?

Until recently, I was using a small point-and-shoot Polaroid 7MP for still photos, and an RCA Small Wonder to shoot 640x480 video (I shoot for the Web, so I can live without high def). Both worked well for what I needed, but the limited one-hour recording time for the Small Wonder was ahuge (but at the time unavoidable) annoyance--it required that I carry along an ASUS PC EEE netbook (which is also, by the way, a wonderful little machine) to download all the footage every time the camera got full.  So a few weeks ago, when some shmuck stole my fanny pack containing my Small Wonder (and a bag of raisins), I decided to use it as an opportunity to consolidate some things and save myself some weight. So the critera I set for a replacement camera was (1) had to do both video and still photos, (2) had to be able to use SD cards for storage so I wouldn't have to carry the ASUS laptop with me anymore, (3) had to be as small and light as possible, (4) had to use AA batteries instead of lithium-ion, and (5) since I'm poor, it had to be cheap cheap cheap.The Coolpix L20 fits all those.Some of the other cameras I considered, and the reasons why I rejected them:The Flip. Nice video camera, but it doesn't do stills, and the built-in non-expandable 2hr recording limit would be crippling for me. I was getting tired of lugging that ASUS around with me all the time. I'd much rather carry around just a couple SD cards.The Vado HD. This one does both photo and video (both standard VGA and 720p HD), and has 8G of internal memory, giving it more recording time than the Flip.  I liked it. But it was important for me to have an expandable storage capacity, and the Vado doesn't take cards. It also uses a lithium-ion battery, and I wanted something that used AA's. So I had to rule it out.The Kodak Zi8. This really looked like a great camera, and I considered it very very carefully. It has almost everything I wanted (and real 1080p High-Def, to boot). It alllmmmooosssttt went into my pack. Ultimately, though, the reason I rejected it was because it uses a lithium-ion battery instead of AA's.  For most people that probably wouldn't be a problem (although it might be a problem that the Zi8 costs twice as much as the L20). For me, though, AA batteries were a necessity, since I use a solar panel to charge the camera in the field, and finding a AA charger that will work off a solar panel is easy, but finding a lithium-ion charger that works with solar is not easy at all. There is also the advantage that, no matter what flyspeck of a little town I might happen to wander into off the trail, I can *always* find AA batteries somewhere if I need them. It's just worlds more convenient to be able to use readily-available rechargeable AA's instead of proprietary lithium-ion. And of course it's better for our Mother Earth, too.So I went with the Coolpix, and have not regretted it. Is the photographic or video quality as good as a pricey high-end model?  Nope. But it's pretty darn good. Unless you're a professional photographer shooting for National Geographic or something, this little camera will do everything you need to do, especially if you use a mini-tripod. As for the video, if you want super-sharp broadcast-quality high def, then this ain't the camera for you.  But if you just want to shoot video of your vacation or your kids for YouTube, FaceBook, or email, this will do the job admirably.My only real concern was how well it would stand up to being in the wild for extended periods of time. So far, though, my worries have been groundless.  Although I try to protect it from rain, mud, sand and dust as much as I can (ziploc baggies are a backpacker's friend), it's still gotten a pretty good amount of abuse with me, and came through just fine. It even got accidentally dropped once with no ill effect (something I don't recommend you try for yourself).Of course I realize that most people probably don't have the specific requirements for a camera that I did.  But if you're just looking for a good basic video/still camera, with the convenience of readily-available batteries, this one is pretty hard to beat.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted", "Author": "Lisa Miller \"firstgrandma\"", "ReviewID": "R1SP3B56MFD06O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched alot of cameras to get just what I wanted.

We bought it for a few reasons: 1) it was reasonably priced 2) it was rated as having a fairly fast response time (important for pix of our young grandchildren) and 3) the overall ratings were good.CONS-- It tend to confuse orange with yellow (as others have said) and it tends to overexpose some shots, especially \"posed\" shots of folks (not so bad for me in that you have a quick one-button fix to adjust exposure level, but my wife can't handle more than one or two buttons at a time!).-- It has a lot of options for various situations (a PRO), some that work for me, some that don't (a CON).  I took a few pans in hopes of using the included stitching software, but something went all wrong. I guess I should have practiced it first-- the facial recognition technology works sometimes, sometimes doesn't, not a big deal to me but a disappointment.-- a friend had an Olympus (in fairness, a lot more expensive than this) that had a much nicer LCD screen (about the same size, but more vivid/bright).  Had we not compared them, though, I'm not sure I would have noticed.PROS-- it is a pretty pearly red color!-- it is indeed quick to respond-- its size is just right.  We had a more expensive touch-screen camera, much smaller, that got trashed for that very reason- my wife had it in her coat pocket, it got caught in the car door and smashed.  So we didn't want too small a camera this time.  This fits in your pocket, but isn't small enough to forget.-- I like the AAs- buy Duracell Rechargeables, they last a LONG time-- the Auto/snapshot function works pretty well.  I tried a few shots with this setting versus the more specialized function (for isntance, the Portrait setting) and generally found little difference.  But some things are neat: for instance, the Food setting has a color-balance function that allows you to change the shading, which really makes it nicer.-- there is a quick macro-setting button, nice for us since we take lots of pix of flowers.In general the quality of pix was very good, given the price of the camera.

I'm a hobbyist photographer and have plenty of experience with a multitude of cameras so an inexpensive point n' shoot such as this shouldn't have been a problem. I tend to steer clear of any electronic item that has a color other than standard silver/black as I feel they're typically marketed for the inexperienced and as teenager toys. In this case, I feel both applies. First, the PROS: I like the fact that you can use AA's rather than having a built-in rechargable, as you may not have the option to plug n' charge when you're out on vacation/sight-seeing. Sadly there is no auto-power-off feature so be sure to pay attention or even your spendy digital batteries are going to have a short lifespan when you need them most. The LCD is clear and large enough to get a good idea of what your photo will look like without having to squint. Camera has a sturdy feel/weight to it and is comfortable in a small to moderate sized hand. Ultimately the camera itself is fairly easy to operate and the fact that it has a built in video recorder will make it nice for someone who doesn't have need (or enough hands) to cart around a separate camcorder.Unfortunately, several of the images came out blurry, over-exposed (even with the exposure adjustments that are easy to set up), or the colors were 'off'. I noticed that the red-eye didn't go off when it should have - specifically for pet photos. Also, the shutter is so slow that if there is even the slightest movement from your subject the image blurs and will render the photo useless. I've also found that if the camera has any movement just after the shutter clicks (between 2-5 seconds after) it will also cause your image to blur...I'm not the most patient photographer when it comes to having to hold a camera still after pressing the button. I was also not impressed with the software for transferring images from camera to pc - I prefer a plug-n-play style of uploading images, not because I'm computer illiterate, but because I'm lazy and just want the darn thing to upload my files quickly so I can edit them and upload them to where I want to send them. For those of you who've had better success with this camera - you've either got much more patience than I, or just not as much experience with photography even within this price range of cameras. For a temporary camera that you don't have to fuss with, I'd recommend a kodak throw-away over this one.

And the time between shooting the picture and when the camera actually takes it is ridiculously long...its hard enough to get kids to look at the camera as it is...I can't tell you how many of our pics with this camera have been of my kids walking away from the shot (and to top it off, it's blurry!!).

I have a NIKON D50 SLR for those really precious jobs, and I wanted a small camera I could have in the pocket sort of \"all the time.\" I tried several small ultra-compact cameras and I hated them all. Too many weird buttons that made quick operation all but impossible without carrying around a telephone book sized manual. I mean, after all, what's the purpose of a pocket camera, if not to whip it out on a whim and get a quick picture?Here's three things I really like about this baby.1. There are four key buttons on the top deck: Power, Shooting mode, Review pictures and the shutter button. Pull the camera out, hit the power button and you can take a picture in a second. No fumbling, no hunting for the right button. It is logical, easy to remember and doesn't overwhelm you with a billion choices before you can take a picture.2. It takes AA batteries. Cool, I have boxes of AA and I don't need YET ANOTHER little charger! Plus, there won't be a bum lithium battery to try to replace in two years. AA batts are cheap and in this camera they last a long time.3. The LCD screen is HUGE, bright, and gives a great preview or slideshow.Here's the one thing I don't like: It's a bit fatter than my wife's 20mm Olympus. It's more like 1.1\" thick. Not unmanageable, but it's as large as you'd really want for this kind of camera. It's the AA batteries that make it a bit thicker. BUT---shooting with this gem is 10X faster and easier than with my wife's compact Oly - (which is the most confusing menu system I've ever seen on any product in my life. )Oh, the pictures? So far I think they are fabulous. This is a 10MP camera - - how much do you need for a pocket camera? With a 4GB standard SD card you can get like 1000 pictures! That's a long party!Everything about this camera feels like a well made sports car - I may just pack up that big SLR and ......well, maybe not.

We actually own 3 assorted digital cameras, including my favorite, my Canon Rebel XT EOS. However, I wanted something for keeping on my body when out with my kids or to keep in my purse. The fact that the Nikon L20 took mini videos was a BIG bonus with me... I could leave my Blackberry in my pocket and get better little videos to email with the Nikon L20. And I could leave the Handycam in the house when not shooting major events. I found that I used the Nikon more outdoors than indoors since the shots were VERY slow indoors and photo quality dropped as natural light was replaced by our indoor light. I didn't care, it was a little camera for \"casual\" photos. Fast forward, first week of January 2010. I had the Nikon L20 in my hand, took a picture, left the camera on until it went to \"sleep\" waiting for my child to stop moving long enough for me to get a picture, pushed the button to take it out of \"sleep\" mode. The lens did not adjust and just took a really blurry/ fuzzy picture. I was puzzled and pushed the button again. The result was \"LENS ERROR\" in big red letters. Fast forward again, after getting the approval from Nikon to send the L20 back, the resounding and ridiculous email response amounted to they were NOT going to fix it and too bad. But I could pay them 106 dollars and change to fix it (more than what the camera is currently selling for). And no, they wouldn't send it back unless I paid them.  (I won't be having it fixed. I WORK FOR MY MONEY THANK YOU!) No longer is customer service part of what you are buying with a product. I didn't break it. However, from what I was told after the fact, it would NOT have taken more than a bump on the lens  or front of the camera without knowing to cause a multitude of \"LENS ERRORS\" on this camera.

We replaced the batteries 3 times in just a couple of weeks and I am not a heavy picture taker.  I think it was because of the lack of a viewfinder.  The picture quality was much better than our old 3.1 megapixel camera, but the colors, etc. just felt average.  Ultimately, after replacing the batteries several times, we decided to swap it out for a canon powershot digital elph camera.  It was only then that I could truly see that the nikon had only an average picture quality.  I have only charged the cannon's battery twice in a month and a half - once when we first got it and then once more just in case because we were going to a party.  We have taken the cannon to the zoo, several school functions, my kids birthday party, and random other things.  The nikon, in comparison, did not make it 30 mins. at the state fair.  I took it out later the next day and was able to record video on those same \"dead\" batteries before the camera told me again they were dead. We also took it to a halloween carnival with mostly fresh batteries.  It lasted an hour of on and off picture taking.  This is just to give you an idea about the battery comparison and my camera use.  Finally, the one thing the nikon did very well, was extremely close up pictures.

Wasn't thrilled to see the L20 Coolpix was made in China but what isn't anymore?  The Nikon has a few \"have to learn\" features to finally get it right and isn't really intuitive for a 63 year old who is way behind on the electronic learning curve.  Once I learned that in \"easy auto mode\" one has to push the shutter button 1/2 way (like my old camera)to lock in the pix before taking it all was well.  Also once one plays with the multitude of advanced features and editing capability it becomes somewhat amazing using the enlarged screen.  It would be nice if there was a viewer but even in the bright FL sun I can still make out the objects I'm trying to photo.  I had one issue where I thought the batteries went dead without the logo warning and replaced them only to have it happen again so was ready to return L20 to store.  Upon closer inspection the battery/memory door is tricky (must use slight force down and sideways) to get closed properly and can otherwise be ajar making it lose power without any warning while off.

Now that my trip is over and after 700 pics taken in just over 3wks Down Under, I have to say the Nikon Coolpix is a pretty decent camera. Its one of the easiest cameras Ive ever used. Right out of the box, you pop in a digital media card for photo storage and then turn it on and you are ready to start shooting with the Auto Focus setting already enabled. This auto focus setting changes on the fly (which is good for beginning photo shooters) depending on the kind of shot your taking or time of day (sunlight or evening) your shooting photos. There are other focus modes available as well for more advanced photographers. There is also a video mode that allows you to shoot .avi videos. Has a great power saving function as well that turns off the camera after about 15 seconds of non-use as well. The one thing I dont really like about the camera is the slow turn on time.

I've always been totally satisfied with Nikon reliability, so when I needed to buy a point-and-shoot for taking pictures inconspicuously at conference break-out sessions, buying a Coolpix was a no-brainer... or so I thought.I was wrong.To my later chagrin, I convinced a friend to buy an L20 at the same time I bought mine.The picture quality was OK.  Not as good as my Nikon DSLR's, but that's not surprising.  The pictures were decent, the camera was small, and its operation was quiet, which is what I needed.  My only complaint was that the SD card is in the same compartment as the batteries, but that's a small complaint, and I loved having the convenience of AA batteries.All was fine until one day, just a few weeks after the warranty expired (of course!), the LCD screen suddenly looked like a Rohrshach test.  At about the same time, my friend contacted me and asked about the strange pattern on his L20.  The very same thing had happened to his!  A web search revealed that this is a common problem with the L20.  Nikon says it's due to improper care, but both these cameras had been carefully handled.Nikon wanted nearly the price of a new L20 to repair it, so that was out of the question.  I found that there are people on the web who will repair it for a lot less, or sell you the parts to repair it yourself.  I bought the parts and replaced the LCD screen myself.  It wasn't hard.  It just took some careful handling.  The main problem you're likely to encounter if you do it is that if you don't screw the case back together with absolute care, the zoom stops working.  It's easy to fix.  Just take the camera back a apart and reassemble it.  My friend did the same thing with his and it worked also.Everything was fine for a few months until suddenly one day, once again, no picture on the LCD screen, but this time the problem wasn't the LCD.  It's probably something internal.  This time I'm giving up.  I may buy a Panasonic Lumix as a replacement.  I choose the L20 over a Lumix the last time because of the quality I used to associate with Nikons, but the L20 has been a huge disappointment.Sadly, this Nikon enthusiast cannot recommend the Coolpix L20.UPDATE: My friend ordered a Panasonic Lumix to replace his broken Coolpix and was going to throw out the Coolpix.  I saved it from the trash, dismantled both his Coolpix and mine, and transplanted the LCD from his camera to mine.  Mine is now working perfectly.  It's a really nice little camera, but based on my own experience and the experience of so many others, I know it's probably only a matter of time before this LCD dies also.  In the meantime, at least I have a working point-and-shoot.  I don't recommend that people take this camera apart if they aren't experienced in taking apart electronics - I've been doing it since I was a kid.

I bought this camera modified by a 3rd-party to take only infrared photos, so I can't comment on color accuracy.  (But the infrared pics my modified Coolpix L20 takes are phenomenal.) In use the camera starts quickly and there is virtually no shutter lag.  The camera feels extremely solid in hand - I was very surprised by this compared to how fragile other budget models I've owned in the past by other manufacturers seem.  Its solid weight and build quality exceeded my expectations. This is a point-n-shoot so it's not going to be feature rich but everything you need is there and more.  The menu system is very well-designed and intuitive.  I didn't read the manual and figured it out in a minute.  Another thing I think is great is that Nikon included a manual white balance mode, which can't be taken for granted in budget models.  This improves picture quality enormously when used especially in mixed lighting.  Preset white balance modes nearly always result in an ugly color cast in tricky lighting, and this feature is simply \"a must\" for shooting infrared. 10 megapixels is more than enough resolution for larger prints.  The large bright 3 inch monitor is also a surprising nicety in a camera at this price. It's a very sharp looking camera in glossy red with silver accents.  What sets this camera apart is its very sturdy build quality, above average optics,  inclusion of a manual white balance feature, its big LCD size, and its handsome looks. The only downside is images get noisy above ISO 400, a common issue with all digicams. Overall a very well-done camera by Nikon in the budget segment.

Also, the color is a weird tint, and is almost always fuzzy and foggy looking. My lense is clean, and I have explored all the settings.

To the point that I can't just turn it off again, but I have to open and close the battery door to turn it off, and then turn it on again. It does this quite a few times. This a huge problem when trying to take spur of the moment pics, and pics of temporary things like perhaps a butterfly, or bird.I would recommend this camera only for the purpose of a short term use, for the use of someone on vacation to a resort or something of that sort, where the tropical lighting is perfect. However, in any lighting that is not just perfect, this camera takes very fuzzy pictures with little integrity as far as the color goes.

Read my experience, and you'll see.I bought this camera in December 2009... rarely used it, and stored it in a shockproof case.  By July 2010 it was broken.My experience with Nikon's service was worse than the lousy camera.  They sent me a photo of the camera to say that I broke it, and that it's not under warranty.  All I have asked for was to have my camera fixed... I have asked for service, not an estimate!  Also, the estimate was a scam.  In the estimate, they asked me to pay more money to repair the camera than what I paid for the camera in the first place!  I was already out some cash since I spent money just to send it back safely to them.  It was truly pathetic.I was truly appalled by the response that I've received.  I merely wanted my camera fixed - for Nikon to honor its warranty for a broken camera.  For a company to stand behind its product.  This was NOT what I got.I have tried to keep an open mind.

It works...Construction: It is small enough to carry in your trouser pocket, has a strap lever for a wrist strap. The USB outlet must have been designed by a lefty engineer, though, since the plastic cover has to be lifted and spun upward toward you very inconveniently.Zoom: The 3.5 zoom works fine in photo mode but a lot slower and has smaller zoom range in video mode.Manual exposure will take some getting used to. You get to adjust light exposure yourself, which helps in night photography (or when light isn't all that favorable).Color modes: come in color, vivid color, black & white, sepia.Photo: Shutter speed is on the slow side and the camera needs 2 seconds of processing before you can shoot again. The default mode has a loud shutter sound, but you can manually turn it off. Photo quality is pretty good and stands cropping well.Timer: only one mode with 10 seconds prep time for you to get in place before the camera shoots.Video mode: there's a clock shown on the screen when using the video mode telling you how much video time you have left. You can playback the video you just shot with sound. Switching between video and photo modes isn't as convenient, though, and takes at least a few seconds.The camera comes with Nikon uploader and editing program on a disc. I don't use it, though, since the Samsung photo editing program I already have on my computer works better. If you don't use the Nikon uploader you'll have to manually transfer the photos from the camera to the pc. Read the manual on it!

It you used the entire zoom you will loose some quality on the photo.The LCD display could have a better resolution, because at the beginning when you don't know the camera, you can thing the photo that you take came blur or that you moved the camera but no, it is just low quality on definition on the LCD screen, when you download it on you PC, you see that the photo it has excellent color and definition.It is easy to have bad photos if you don't know how to hold the camera or if your pulse is not to good, the capacity of image stabilization it not has good has the cannon but the cannon is double the price.I read on previews reviews that if you drop the camera is done, well if you drop any camera from 4FT high or more you have a high possibilities that you will loose the camera, so protect the camera as you should and you will have years of service.In conclusion if you are looking for a low budged and high quality camera for the price, you need to go for this Nikon, the lens is great and the features are much better than any other point and shot camera.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the everyday user to get snapshots.", "Author": "Jimm", "ReviewID": "R19SKC3ZV5MVLV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as a present and it's very good for the user.

You hardly need the flash, even in low light and at night the image sensitivity is excellent and easily adjustable (just have a steady hand when you take the shot in low light because the shutter tends to stay open longer and that may cause some bluriness in the picture), again; you hardly need the flash (will save battery life). Video and audio quality are also excellent and battery life is adequate. The large screen is a plus as well. Only gripe is with the SD card being inside the battery compartment which it means that you need to open the fragile battery door everytime you want to take the SD card out. Quick tip 1: keep the resolution at 5 megapixels for a regular size 4x6 photo, you can't tell the difference in sharpness between 5 and 10 mpx and you'll have twice as much storage on your card.

I needed a camera in a hurry to replace my Nikon 2100 that I have used for several years and the price I paid (<$100) meant I wasn't risking a lot.  I have used the camera for four months primarily for snapshots, a job it does admirably.  The 10 Megapixel resolution allows me greater enlargements than I could get with the older 2100 (2.2 megapixels).  I also use the camera for recording data of various types in place of note-taking; such as product descriptions on store labels, documents, newspaper items, etc.  Does that job fine.  The recessed on/off button solves the issue of having the camera turned on by carrying it in my pocket.  The size is convenient and power supplied by two AA batteries is an advantage.  I live in New Mexico where bright sunlight can be a problem when taking pictures out of doors - that's why I wanted a view finder.  The lack of a viewfinder is the reason I give the camera four stars rather than five.

I liked the description of the features, particularly the \"Easy Auto Mode,\" since I sometimes found myself wanting to switch modes on my Kodak more quickly than it could handle.I have to say that I was underwhelmed.  While the modes were very good for their intended purposes (I got some amazing shots of a sunrise from the Promenade in Jerusalem while touring), the shutter speed and focus were disappointing.  Shooting pictures from a moving tour bus was impossible, and the photos I tried to take during a friend's wedding all came out hopelessly blurred.  When I tried switching to the Easy Auto Mode, the camera spent long enough deciding which mode to use that the moment was gone by the time the picture finally snapped.  Thank goodness other friends are willing to share their wedding snapshots.  I don't mean that the camera takes an extremely long time, just do not use Easy Auto Mode while trying to capture something in motion.The video capability of this camera was a really nice surprise.

One had zoom, great for when you have your hands full.4. Huge display.What I would improve?1. You cannot zoom out once you start the video recording. You can zoom in more, and then back to where you started, but if you start the video in partial zoom, there is no way to go all the way back out. At least not that I have found.2. It takes a few seconds to \"warm up\" when you turn it on. It wants you to select your mode and then the rebound time seems fine for me (mostly taking pics of my kids).3. HATED the auto select mode, in terms of what type of pic it would take. The thing could not seem to make up its mind, so I selected the standard auto mode and now it works fine. In the camera's defense, I didn't read the manual before trying it out so I might be doing something wrong, but if I can't just point, shoot and have a good pic, I don't care.

There is a serious design flaw in this camera that results in unacceptably poor image quality in all but bright daylight.  Shooting indoors in the middle of the day in a fairly brightly lit room produced images that were comparable to most cell phone camera.  The problem seems to be its metering. Set to auto mode, the camera refused to flash, even though its meter was clearly telling it that there was not sufficient light.  Instead, it pushed the ISO to 800 and then dropped the shutter speed to 1/30.  The result: a drab, grainy, noisy, blurry picture ( as shooting handheld at 1/30 is likely to do).  Trying other shooting modes (including \"indoor/party\") did not help.  Since you can't force the camera to flash there is little one can do to compensate.

I called Nikon and the guy said that because Nikon doesn't make memory cards, it didn't come with it.  Nikon doesn't make batteries either, but it came with batteries.  And it doesn't explain wihy the other came with the card.  Then he hung up on me.  OK, a memory card isn't expensive, but still, this wasn't right.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Want to Return this Nikon Camera, Please Advise...", "Author": "Lisa A.
