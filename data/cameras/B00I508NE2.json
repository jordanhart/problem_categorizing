Rigolizzo III", "ReviewID": "R2YI3YGZ0Y69P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I was looking for a good quality camera that wasn't quite professional quality (and didn't cost more than a mortgage payment) but good enough to make advertising-quality photos from events that I perform at.  Long story short, I am tired of professional photographers telling me that they will email me a link and I can download any photos from the event that I want, and then they either forget or they deliberately ignore my request.  It was enough of a problem for me that I felt it warranted the expense of a good camera for myself and my business.  Regardless, I like updating photos on my website and other areas, and my crossover camera just wasn't getting the job done.  It was good for pictures of the kids in the backyard, but it didn't do presentation-quality photos.I was going back and forth between the Canon T3i and the T5i for weeks, searching different packages, looking for a sale, whatever.  I just couldn't pull the trigger on any of them.  Not really sure why.  Then I read one review on a T5i package, and saw that there was a sale running on Nikons and that for roughly the same price point, the Nikon blows the Canon out of the water as far as image quality goes.Those were the words of the post, so I did my homework.  I went to the websites, compared specs, compared sample photos, etc.  Within a few hours I pulled the trigger on this one.  Granted that even with the rebate, the Nikon was far more expensive than the Canon's I was looking at.  However I came across this package that was pretty reasonable and included an autofocus zoom lens, which a lot of cheaper ones didn't include.  Couple that with Amazon's 12 months interest-free financing, and I was sold.Thank goodness I did!  I just received it and I literally couldn't put it down.  I was like a kid on Christmas Eve morning waiting for the battery to charge so I could try it out.  It was a little more than I wanted to pay for it, but the 20.2 megapixels vs 18 megapixels will allow me to print my 24x36 photos in much better quality.  At that size, pixels matter.  When I placed the order, I figured I would play around and see if I liked it, maybe send it back if I didn't like something, whatever.  Nope!  This baby is here to stay!I was absolutely blown away by the picture quality and detail.  My wife wasn't thrilled with this particular photo, but at 20ft (she was in the kitchen, I was in the dining room) you could literally see the pores in her skin, and that was with the standard lense.  That gives you an idea of the image quality we're talking about.All in all, I don't know if you can buy a better camera at this price level, and this package really sweetens the pot.The only real drawback to this particular package is that there is no flash and no tripod.  I ended up buying them separately, and I also picked up a car charger with an extra battery.  Not the end of the world, but those were things I was looking for.One drawback to the Nikon line is that their individual items are CRAZY expensive.  Some of the lenses cost more than the camera.  I recognize that they are more professional quality lenses, but SHEESH!  I hope I never have to replace a lense on this camera, but I did get the 4-year warranty package to cover me for a while.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I508NE2"}}
