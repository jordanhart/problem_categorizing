I already have 3 Canon compacts, all of which produce very nice shots in good light.  I got the Fujifilm X20 but it was a bit too large for my pockets and my son quickly claimed it for himself.I was very impressed by the P340 picture quality - sharpness and coloration ... even in less than ideal lighting.  The smaller file size make the wifi transfer a speedy affair and at 12mb, crisp images can fill a 42\" monitor.The battery life was also better than I assumed it'd be (dpreview specs had it at 220 shots) ... so with the 2-pack wasabi batteries, running out of juice shouldn't be an issue.If there's one thing I'd change, it'd be the  On/Off button ... which is a bit too small/recessed.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little on-the-go camera.", "Author": "Levi", "ReviewID": "R12ITEJFF4B4IX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've looked around between the Nikon P330, Coolpix A, Sony NEX-5T, NEX-6, and A6000. Basically, I personally found the P340 to be the best value. I bought the P330 two weeks ago and thought that I could save $$ by just buying the P330 & the wifi adapter (WU-1a). I was wrong. The P330 was ok but having a wifi dongle was somewhat of an inconvenience because it's an extra accessory that you have to hang on to and bring everywhere, not to mention trying not to lose it since it's so small.I had to return the P330 but was stuck between the Coolpix A (imported) and the NEX-5T, which both are around the same price. I like the Coolpix A but aside from the fix(prime lens), you would also need to buy a wifi adapter. Downers.The NEX-5T was good, but the EVF and dial modes on the NEX-6 was a no brainer. BUT, I found out that the A6000 will be coming out soon, and will have everything the NEX-6 has plus few added features like higher resolution, more focus points, etc. But at the same time, it is about $800. More than what I originally wanted to spend. I mean for just a couple more hundreds i could get a D7100 DSLR.So I decided that I would opt to just exchange the P330 for the P340. And so far I'm really glad with the decision. Main difference between the two are the built-in WiFi (aside from transferring images, you can also control and take photos using a compatible phone- I use an iphone 5 and didn't have problems connecting, transferring and taking pics using my phone. Another is the control ring, where you can assign it's function from zoom to focus to aperture. And I really like that feature. It adds manual control of the camera.I kinda don't like that when you use it for focusing the image on the display zooms in to the area of focus and then zooms out when you're about to press the shutter, but I can live with that. I also noticed better/faster focusing on the P340 than the P330, as well as better image quality overall than the P330.This is my first impression so far, with just a few hours of play with the P340. I like the build quality, the user-friendly controls, the color, the simplicity. Cons for the P340 are the relatively slow writing of images, slow menu navigation/processing of changes, double confirmation prior to deleting images (which may be a good thing but I wish I could turn the double confirmation on/off), manual focus with the control ring or the in-camera controls, and relatively low battery life.Overall, I would still recommend the P340 for those looking for an affordable, quality-built compact camera with built-in wifi, RAW and full manual control,", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Suffers from all the sakes things the P330 did.
