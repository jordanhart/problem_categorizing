{"Reviews": [{"Title": "20x Pocket Zoom Comparison - Panasonic ZS19 vs. Sony HX20 vs. Canon SX260", "Author": "Artemaria", "ReviewID": "RYJ7ZPKATCA3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't decide between these three cameras (and their variants, the Sony HX30 and the Panasonic ZX20) because many of the reviews of each made the cameras sound very similar. So, I went out and bought (from merchants who accepted returns) one of each of these three cameras (I didn't need WI-FI or GPS, so that's how I settled on these less expensive variants). And then I took photos and videos in various conditions. I am not a professional photographer, and I didn't do Imatest or any other specific tests on the images (you can read C/net for that), but this is an experience of a regular person who was taking pictures and videos with these three cameras side by side, which is a comparison that you do not often see.The bottom line is that these three cameras are very similar with a few minor differences, but those differences set them apart and may make you decide that you like one more than the other.Generally speaking, NONE of these cameras is a DSLR replacement. Whomever writes that the pictures are as good as a DSLR is not speaking accurately. Also, none of the cameras is a replacement for a high end camcorder.OUTSIDE PICTURESIf you are taking pictures outside on a sunny day all of these cameras will take very nice pictures for small to medium enlargements (no bigger than 8 x 10). The cameras all produce nice fairly sharp images that would be well suited for that purpose. And, like most people, I don't remember ever enlarging a picture more than 8 x 10, so it is not a common problem.What might be an issue is if you are zoomed in all the way and wanted to crop a photo (which sometimes happens), the differences in the way the cameras' photos look when you \"pixel peep\" might make a difference. In good light outside, the cameras were close, but the best photos were from the CANON with the SONY and the PANASONIC a close second.INSIDE PICTURES - GOOD LIGHTIf you are inside and you are taking pictures in low light, you will see a different story. Again, at smaller sized prints 4x6, 5x7, most people will see almost no difference between the pictures of the three cameras other than the PANASONIC's colors are a little less vibrant than those in the CANON and the SONY. I am not sure whether those colors are less accurate, they are just a little less vivid.If you pixel peep at these pictures, the CANON's photos are clearly the best with the PANASONIC's being second. The CANON's remain very sharp through a good amount of enlargement while the PANASONIC's, although close, get softer a little faster. The SONY's pictures inside with good light became soft rather quickly and, I'm not sure if this is because the SONY has 18MP on a small chip (as some of the tech reviewers write), but there is a \"watercolor\" effect where after you enlarge it a little bit, it looks like a Claude Manet painting.INSIDE PICTURES - LOW LIGHTIn poor light, the hierarchy between the cameras remains the same, but there is less of a gap between the CANON and the PANASONIC. It seems as if the CANON takes somewhat worse pictures in low light, and the PANASONIC just doesn't get that much worse. As a result, the gap between these two becomes somewhat closer. The SONY's pictures remain the poorest of the three in low light.VIDEO - OUTSIDE GOOD LIGHTAll three cameras take very nice video outside in good light. If you are editing or nitpicky, you will note that the SONY and the PANASONIC take 60 frames per second, which is somewhat easier to edit, than the 24 frames per second that the CANON records. While you have to look for it, the CANON's outside video does have a couple of instances where it seems to be a tad jerky compared to the SONY and PANASONIC's video. But you really have to look for it and most people won't notice if you don't have another video outside for comparison.While all the outdoor video is close, I would give the edge to the SONY in video, with the PANASONIC second and the CANON third. But they are close for outside video.VIDEO - INSIDETaking video inside is a different story. Inside, the SONY shines and clearly has the best video. The video from this camera is actually good. It is not professional level by any stretch, but it is good solid quite viewable video from a camera that takes still pictures.There is a noticeable difference on indoor video between the SONY and the PANASONIC. This difference was perhaps most noticeable to me because I had both videos from both cameras and watched them over and over again looking for differences. While the difference is noticeable, it is not a tremendous difference. The SONY video is super smooth and seems to get as much out of the light as it can. The PANASONIC video also is smooth and gets a good contrast tone and color out of the available light, but is slightly less smooth than the SONY. The PANASONIC video is still very viewable and looks good, but not as good as the SONY.The CANON will take decent indoor video in good light, but in poor light, it just seems to struggle. The CANON's video had many shadows and dark areas that simply were not present in the SONY and PANASONIC videos. I did not notice any hissing in the CANON video as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. This may be an issue that varies from camera to camera.HANDLING AND SPEEDThis was a fairly subjective comparison between the three cameras as to how they felt in the hand and how quickly the camera did what I wanted it to do because if the camera doesn't take the shot when you want to, it doesn't really matter how sharp the picture or video might be.Based on my experience, the PANASONIC had the best handling of the three. While the PANASONIC and the SONY were both quick to take a picture, for some reason the SONY that I had would take a much longer time (seconds) to record the picture onto the card. This was despite the fact that both cameras had comparable cards with comparable write speeds. Both the SONY and the PANASONIC had rather quick autofocus which also made them seem to react faster. The PANASONIC is noticeably thinner and lighter than the SONY while maintaining a similar full raised rubber grip on the front which made the camera easier to handle. While both the SONY and the PANASONIC were quick, the blazingly fast (by comparison) write speeds on the PANASONIC compared with its almost non-existent shutter lag made this the best handling camera of the three by far.Even though it consistently took the best pictures, the CANON was the worst handling camera. The autofocus often had issues focusing and there was a constant shutter lag while it was searching for its focus. We did miss some shots because the CANON was so slow to react. Also, the CANON is somewhere in weight between the SONY and the PANASONIC, but has the worst grip of the three. That little rubber strip on the front is not as effective a grip as the fuller grip that appears on the SONY and the PANASONIC.With respect to handling, I've read many reviews and each of them seems to state different things about each of the cameras. Many of these reviews seem to indicate that the SONY is a very fast camera, and that might be the case, but the write speed of the 18 MP pictures (which are 50% larger than the CANON's photos and almost the same for the PANASONIC) was so slow, it was distracting and detracted from the experience of using the camera.VERDICT AND CONCLUSIONSNone of these cameras is the best at everything. The CANON has the best pictures, but is slow to focus, somewhat awkward to handle and has the worst video of the three. The SONY handles okay but is heavy and has noticeably slow write speeds, its picture quality varies greatly with the light (and will deteriorate rapidly with any significant cropping) but the SONY has the best video, and it is noticeable.In the end I decided to go with the PANASONIC. While it only was the best in handling, to me that was a significant portion of the photographic experience. It is not DSLR fast (instantaneous), but it is a zippy camera for a superzoom, is light in weight and has a good grip which makes it easier to hold. Also, it does not have a pop-up flash which I found always seemed to come up under my fingers where I was holding the left side camera. As noted above, the PANASONIC's videos were good, perhaps not as good as the SONY, but the PANASONIC was certainly capable of capturing some nice video, even in low light. The photos also were not as good as the CANON's, but they were close and very close in low light. With respect to the vibrancy of the colors, if you set the photo vibrancy on the PANASONIC to \"happy\" (which I guess is their \"vivid\") it is less of a noticeable difference. The photos look very nice and certainly are competitive in quality for this type of camera.Hopefully this comparison and these observations will help you decide between these three similar cameras so you can choose the best one for your needs. Good luck.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great pics and video - MAC user notes", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R20S7HK351F597", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was time to upgrade our old video camera AND point-and-shoot camera. I wanted a small, new camera that did BOTH really well, but was also small enough to fit in my purse or pocket. After much research, I decided on the Panasonic Lumix ZS19 (didn't go for the ZS20 since I can't see myself needing GPS on pics or videos.) So far, I'm really loving this camera.PICTURE QUALITY: I'm not a professional photographer, just a mom who needs a great camera on the go, and this fit the bill perfectly. Now that I see how good our videos look, I WISH I upgraded a long time ago. I first used the camera to take pics and video of my kids at an indoor TKD event, and several parents asked what kind of camera I was using because the photos were coming out so good! The indoor lighting varied from strong sunset coming in through the windows, to overhead fluorescent bulbs later in the evening, but I still was able to get great pics with and without the awesome 20x optical zoom ...and this was within hours of receiving the camera in the mail. I literally just needed to \"point-and-shoot\" to get great shots without knowing anything about the camera.SOMETHING TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING A MAC: The software that comes with this camera is not compatible with a Mac, so the accompanying CD will only display a PDF copy of the user's manual, and NOT the software that is meant to be used with the camera. You can view and import your photos using iPhoto, HOWEVER, VIDEOS FROM THIS CAMERA WILL NOT DISPLAY IN iPHOTO. But there is a SIMPLE solution for this... After researching comments online, I found that by opening iMovie on my Mac, and selecting \"IMPORT FROM CAMERA\", I can easily and quickly import videos from this camera into iMovie. From there you can edit them, add music, text, etc., and then export your video to whatever format you want. I'm actually glad I discovered this because it forced me to open and use iMOVIE for the first time, and I've already made some incredible movies from the videos and pics I've taken with this camera.MEMORY CARD AND BATTERY COMMENT: Based on Amazon comments I read before I chose this camera, I also bought a \"Class 10\" memory card to go with it. I guess the \"Class 10\" is better for taking high-quality videos. The only thing I noticed is that taking video quickly drains the battery (albeit, I have the video quality set pretty high) so I also ordered a backup battery to have an extra on hand when I need it. This camera should probably not replace your video camera since you won't be able to take long movies due to the battery drain, but it's great for short clips here-and-there, which is pretty much all I take anyway.For what I needed, this camera was the perfect choice. I'm VERY pleased with it.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the camera, but little battery power.", "Author": "E. Phillips", "ReviewID": "R15GXDUNNHBE1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a snap to use and it takes some amazing photos.  However, on vacation a battery would last for approximately 110 photos, not the 260 the web site claims.Photos taken in a dark church for example, turned out fantastic as they did in bright sunlight.The wide angle view helps when taking photos of large buildings and landscapes.I also like the feel of the camera.  It's slightly larger than pocket size, but that's helpful when you're trying to hold the camera steady under low light conditions.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just an impulse purchase but AM I GLAD", "Author": "Ellie \"Eilean Siar\"", "ReviewID": "RSXKY6TD4R8FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll begin with a description of the only (thankfully quite fixable) problem I had when initially trying out the features of my new Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS19. I was having a problem with random tripping of the shutter. Just got my ZS19 and haven't read all of the manual yet. For anyone else reading this, the little raised finger and camera back on the lower right just has to be touched firmly to toggle it on and off.That's it - the only bad thing I found and it's my bad for not figuring it out quicker. The rest from here on are the things I like.I like the touch interface for reviewing shots quickly, starting movie review, and setting the focus point for tracking. You can also zoom in or out using the touch screen.This is an upgrade for me from the ZS9 to the ZS19. Not much of an upgrade in some respects except better video resolution, lens coating, and zoom ratio at 20X.I've had six Panasonic/Leica cameras in the past seven years (always upgrading for more thrills) and none has failed to deliver great results. The larger models have the best lens you can find in a P/S camera. Usual small sensor deficits - nothing but grin and bear it. But really fun to use and gets great quality shots for this category of camera.In case, unlikely as it may be, that someone is thinking of buying the LEICA version of this camera (look on the Leica website to find it), my experience having both the Panasonic and Leica versions of the DMC-FZ50 bridge camera (10 megapixel) is that there's hardly a dime's worth of difference except the pride of ownership of a Leica. For that pleasure you pay maybe US $400 more for essentially the same camera with a red dot in the upper left corner of the front.I understand the Leica and Panasonic versions are made in the same Japanese factory (as was this - Made In Japan - always good to know) but just on different floors. So, one gets a Leica on the cheap, so to speak, with this camera.The F/3.3 lens on this camera is not a fast lens so you won't get any wretched excess of what camera buffs call \"bokeh\" which is a Japanese word meaning an out of focus and creamy background while your main subject stays sharp and stands out better for impact.But with very good image stabilization on most digital cameras today, a really fast lens is not necessary as it was years ago with film cameras which lacked that feature. The reason for fast lenses back then was so you could use a fast shutter speed to reduce camera shake blur.The bonus is that the depth-of-field is very good with a small sensor such as this camera has. Typically, except on a closeup, everything will be in focus from front to back in the shot. I happen to like that on most of my work as an amateur photographer. When I apply photo post-processing on my PC or using software on my iPad, I get sharp results I like.While I do feel for the people who are disappointed that the results from this little, not very expensive, P/S camera do not match what one can get from a digital single lens reflex camera (which would cost many time more and weigh much more and take up far more space), I hardly think their expectations are legitimate. Anyone who knows photography knows that.Close-ups are a strong point of this camera. You'll get some nice ones with excellent depth-of-field. Just don't expect to use it on iA (intelligent auto) which may fire the flash. The extended lens may shadow the macro subject. Instead select P (program mode) or some other non-Auto mode and press the flash on/off on the right of the many control wheel on the back to shut the flash off. Then, move your subject to get strong light from the side where it will not be blocked by the lens. Indoors, you can position a light source on one or both sides. Results will be improved. Try M (manual) to get the exposure right. Or use A (aperture) selecting a high number (like F/8) to give more depth-of-field.This is a fun camera for anyone to use. Boomers who started in photography decades ago may now not care to lug around a heavy SLR any longer. They will treasure this. And, while this camera is not quite a hip-pocket camera, young photographers will be really glad they got a quality P/S camera with decent portability. My hint for them, and everybody, is to be sure to attach the wrist strap to the side. just above the cable inputs, and always use that strap. Drops kill cameras.My experience is that these don't wear out. If you don't drop it, dunk it, sit on it, or let the dog grab it and run off, it will last a long time.

Decent indoor video apparently requires a larger lens, as you might find on a camcorder.There is also an intermittent issue with the ZS19 where the camera will not shut off when the switch is moved to the off position, and the lens won't retract, until the battery is removed and reinserted.

JUST PRESS THE SHUTTER BUTTON, HOLD, MOVE 360 DEGREES AND BOOM YOU HAVE A GREAT PANORAMA PICTURE THAT YOU CAN ALSO PLAYBACK AS A MOVIE CLIP! PRETTY COOL.CON'S:1. NO SNOW OR BEACH SCENE MODE WHICH I PERSONALLY FOUND VERY HANDY ON MY PREVIOUS CAMERAS2. THE ON/OFF AND REVIEW BUTTONS ARE SLIDE TYPE AND NOT PUSH BUTTONS, VERY ANNOYING TO ME. I KNOW THAT IT'S A BIT BETTER TO HAVE THEM THIS WAY SO YOU WON'T ACCIDENTALLY PUSH THEM, BUT STILL IT'S ANNOYING TO REVIEW YOUR PICTURE AND FORGET THE BUTTON IN THE REVIEW POSITION AND LATER WHEN YOU TURN THE CAMERA ON AND TRY TO TAKE A PICTURE REALLY QUICK YOU LOSE IMPORTANT SECONDS BY REALIZING THAT YOU DIDN'T SLIDE THE REVIEW BUTTON UP LAST TIME YOU REVIEWED YOUR PICTURES...SO NOW THE CAMERA IT'S NOT READY FOR PICTURES...ZS25 PRO'S:1.

You can read my detailed reviews athttp://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MYNT7BUPG4FJ/ref=ya_26?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReviewbut in summary:Canon SX260HS did nice on the photos but lacked modern useful features like in camera panorama and 3D photos.Sony DSC HX20V was an improvement over HX9V but was thicker and bulkier than the competition, with an awkward charging position, a relatively difficult to use Panorama mode and didn't cleanly terminate videos.Samsung WB750 had a defective screen coating, an annoying processing delay before photos got saved and lousy customer service.Nikon Coolpix S9100 didn't focus well in low light.Casio Ex ZR100 had poor image stabilization and Casio seems to now have dropped off from the race for compact superzoom's.Compared to the all the other brands I didn't find any flaw in the Panasonic making me want to return it. The camera is very sturdy and slim (1.1\") for a 20x zoom. You get a very wide angle 24mm Leica lens and the Power OIS works well allowing you to use the 20x optical zoom.

I was impressed with the quality of the low-light , zoomed in, no-flash pictures she took with it, conditions which are always problematic for these little cameras.  So I bought one  My brand new LUMIX ZS19 was sitting on the kitchen counter, I hadn't even tried it out yet, when a bluebird alighted just outside the kitchen window.  I slowly reached around, took a couple shots before the little guyflew away, one regular field, one zoomed in.  Then I looked at the picture...OMG!!  Both pictures were great, but the zoomed in picture, shot through a picture window, with no preparation, just the camera defaults, is AMAZING!!  Clear and focused, beautiful colors.  Wow, I'm so glad I bought this camera!!", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera! Auto mode not as good as I had hoped though...", "Author": "SpeedingCheetah", "ReviewID": "R2SO72HC2IAZOA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Noticeably better than the Sony DSC-W650 in my tests as far as picture quality and much easier of a camera to hold for me. The \"rubber\" grip is actually a rubberized plastic...a bit annoyed at that, hope it won't come off over time. Build quality is top notch, (except for the lens cover thingy, it is very thin and weak, even rattles a little, not a good as I have seen on lower quality cams) The entire camera actually feels a tad on the heavy side, which I like. Easy to hold in your hand...I hate those super thin, credit card style cameras...sure, they can easily fit in your pocket, or even a cell phone case, but I always fell like I am about to drop the thing.The cameras UI isn't as nice looking as the Sony's, in my opinion, but has a ton of features. The touch screen is a nice added touch. The Sony has a mode you could set \"Easy Mode\" in addition to full auto. That would strip the UI down and make things big and super easy to use, blocking access to anything but the pure basics...that is a good idea for those who need that kind of ease of use (my 70yr grandma). This Panasonic doesn't have that aggressive kind of \"Easy\" mode, but the IAuto mode is simple enough for average users. I am not much a fan of selector dials, would prefer it to be a button style, but this one feels very sturdy and I actually like it. I like the one button video record...no more having to switch to video mode! I hated that on my previous cameras, forgetting to check what mode I was in, and end up taking a video instead of a picture..etc. The speed of the camera is wicked fast! The LCD touch screen is very bright and super sharp... unlike the Sony's which is blurry and...just...hard to look at (defective maybe?).This Panasonic only comes with a usb wall charger and very short propitiatory usb cord (About a foot). You have to charge the camera like a cell phone...does not come with a dedicated battery charger...hence why I took a star off. Thankfully, was able to get the real Panasonic one (not a generic) for around $15 on e bay. I, at first, was annoyed at this charging style, but then I realized i can just charge the cam with my cells usb charger...which means less charger to cram in my bag, should I chose too....just have to remember that pesky super special usb cable...Also, was able to get a longer cable on e bay...(Why does it have to be proprietary...and not a standard micro or mini usb cable??... seriously!!) Be sure not to loose the usb cord!Software that comes with it...is...well...basic. First, the video editing one is 30 trial only, $80 more if you want to purchase it. The picture editing software is a full version, but i prefer Paint.NET...more powerful....never a fan of software that comes with products(a pet peeve of mine...why, when you pay for the product, must you then pay more to activate a trial version of software that came with it...I hate that!...) I was much more impressed with Kodak and Cannon with the software they included with my previous(as well as friends) cams.Now, about picture quality...In my tests and comparisons, Panasonic's iAuto ISO setting tends to favor a higher ISO settings (400-1600) quite often, especially when shooting indoors..which leads to loss of fine detail and its noticeable when you zoom in to the picture on your computer screen..iso 100 has good lines and detail...800..blurry fine details...but this is common with all  point and shoots. This Panasonic does a much better job of noise reduction at higher iso's than the Sony. (If you want super sharp detail at high iso's when blown up to 90 - 100%...only option there is DSLR's or those interchangeable compact camera system..which are much more expensive.)Taking pics in my 3rd floor, moderately light apartment... This camera needs more light to take sharp pics than my cheap Kodak C143 camera. That one took sharp, clean pics in auto at a reported iso of 160...where as, with this Panasonic, their auto mode refused to take any below iso 400 under the same lighting conditions, which resulted in a tad less quality of a picture. So not all companies auto modes are the same. Although, the Kodak C143 is not a wide angle lenses, so that may have affected things a bit during my comparing the two. Setting the iso manually to 100 on the Panasonic, picture did seem better the an kodak...but I was a bit surprised that the Intelligent auto mode didn't appear as intelligent as the lower end Kodak cam.Its weird...for the same picture, the Panasonic would sometimes use 1600 or even 3200 iso when the Kodak cam would still stay at 160 or so 95% of the time. I just set the Panasonic camera to P mode and lock the iso to 100 and it does fine most of the time..so far. The i. Exposure feature, when enabled, adjusts the iso only to certain parts of the picture as needed, so it helps compensate for the locked lower iso. Only other feature i miss from my kodak is an option to adjust sharpness.Outside pics are very crisp and sharp. The zoom is incredible!! With the iZoom 20x optical + digital zoom, I was able to get very surprising clear pictures at the full zoom length (40x)...without a tripod. LOVE IT! I defiantly think this Panasonic tops the Sony and Kodak cam I have.... undeniable in the zoom department.As far as video quality goes, indoor, the Sony cam was noticeably better in the low light than the Panasonic. But the Sony only does 720p...no contest to my other cams... they are not hd. Video stabilization on the Panasonic is good, but the Sony does have a setting to increase the aggressiveness of their stabilization, which does surpass the Panasonic with very shaky video. Outdoor, this Panasonic shines with its full hd and zoom capabilities. {Side note: It was the video recording specs of this cam that made me get it instead of the Cannon SX260...the ZS19 can do 60fps at full hd...the Cannon, only 24fps.}Overall, its a bit frustrating trying to compare the few newer and a few older cams I have to each other...not to mention current highly rated cameras to each other.....trying to decide which one takes the best picture ...I wish I could get DSLR quality images out of these things....but don't we all wish for that. Its strange though..I have an old 4mp Olympus P&S; camera that takes super sharp pics and beats most modern high MP P&S; cameras I have tried. I keep going back to that cam, despite it being agonizing slow and can barely hold a charge, despite replacing the batteries..but it is on its last legs...so I am forced to find a replacement. To which, I am satisfied with this Panasonic for my needs, until I can afford to get a Cannon SX50 or a compact interchangeable lens system camera.Update 12-3-13: Just wanted to add...that I recently picked up a Samsung WB210 for my mother to use....compared it to my Panasonic zs19....and I must mention, again, that I am disappointed in Panasonic's iAuto mode. It always selects too high an iso setting and also the coloring is sometimes off....when compared to other cams I have tried....This is mainly for indoor photos. So far....pretty much every other brand of camera's Auto setting does a noticeably better job indoors than Panasonic iAuto. Outdoors, with plenty of light...it does fine.If you are looking for a camera to use solely in Auto mode.....go with another brand.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Automatic Settings Not Very Smart", "Author": "Brent V", "ReviewID": "RQIU6DI5X1T8J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My main criteria for purchasing a point & shoot camera was its performance and quality in \"auto\" mode.  While I like having the ability to manually tweak settings, I need a camera that I can pick up and capture one of my son's adorable baby moments.  Or better yet, if I hand the camera to someone else who doesn't know much about photography or the details of my camera I need to be confident that the photos taken on \"auto\" will come out fine.  After all, you only get one chance to capture some moments and so I want a camera that can handle that duty.Unfortunately, the ZS19 falls short of decent pictures in auto mode in the condition I care most about -- indoors under warm lighting (a room illuminated by a few lamps).  The ZS19's \"auto\" settings made my baby son look like Casper the Friendly Ghost because the flash just wiped out any of the color in the picture.  And if I turned off the flash, the camera wouldn't always choose a good ISO, aperture, white balance, exposure, etc.  If I tweaked those settings manually and took a few test shots I would eventually get the photo I want.  And it looked great.  But as lighting conditions change, I would need to continually tweak the settings since I couldn't trust the auto mode to do the right thing.Don't get me wrong.  I'm not looking for DSLR quality out of a point and shoot in automatic mode.  But I need the picture quality to a least be in the ballpark of what I know the camera can handle when I tweak the settings manually.

As a person who long ago used rangefinders and SLR's but grew too lazy to haul all the stuff around and set up the shots, I have long been drawn to the idea of Compact Digital camera's. The only problem is that most of the one's I have owned over the years were incredibly inadequate for my needs. My kids are teens and I attend a lot of sporting events as well as school band events indoors which I always try to capure in picture or video. My previous 2 camera's, a Canon Powershot SX100 and Nikon Coolpix S8300 both took pictures that were invariably dark and or blurred if taken from a distance indoors without flash as at a school event . I monkeyed with the settings constantly trying to balance the darkness and the blur, but I could never get decent pictures. The Canon in particular sucked up standard AA batteries which I spent a fortune on. I had bought the Nikon in a fit of fury prior to a trip to Ireland and the 2 cameras were adequate in the soft outdoor light of Ireland, (but all the indoor pictures are blurry of course). Fortunately, the Nikon being the slightly better of the 2 cameras, I lost it several months ago and, on recommendations from an old friend and a $200 sale at Best Buy, got this Panasonic. What a difference! I don't know if this just has a much bigger sensor, but this camera takes indoor school event pictures as well as sports event pictures and pictures from moving cars light and sharp and just great. I took some indoor dimly lit pictures that my old camera would never be able to handle and it came out great. Probably the only drawback I've noticed is a bit of overexposure on outside sunny day pics, but this is easy to adjust in iPhoto.Unlike my previous camera's claims, the Intelligent Auto setting seems pretty darn intelligent. I've notice that the camera seems to automatically sense motion and shift into that mode without even having to select for it.

This is honestly one of the best recorders for the price in the point and shoot world. You can get a refurbished ZS19 for around $150.

It's even fast and gives you DSLR-like manual controls if you're into that kind of thing.So it's very unfortunate that the controls are so hard to use--in my case rendering the camera essentially unusable. I found it so frustrating that I actually returned it to the store within a day or two of purchasing it. The controls are a combination of buttons and on-screen controls, and it's really challenging to know when to use which (sometimes you must use one, sometimes the other)... and if you happen to click a left/right button when it's hoping you'd click something onscreen, it suddenly wipes out whatever you were working on, and replaces it with either the flash control or the automatic timer (which are what the buttons do when you don't have any menus open... and apparently sometimes when you do).The touch screen isn't as sensitive as you'd like--I was trying to do a focus-lock on an item in the middle of my screen so I'd tap it, but then when I went down to click the \"lock\" button (on screen) it would suddenly lock onto a point of the floor that was near that \"lock\" button. So I kept locking onto points in the far-bottom-right of the screen, which was really annoying. I tried to set the C1 and C2 buttons (a feature I love with waterfalls--I do one setting for slow-motion-flowy water, and a second one to catch each droplet suspended in air), but for the life of me couldn't figure it out. The generally-quite-helpful person in the store couldn't figure it out either, so the two of us working together were brainstorming things and took about 4 minutes until we were finally able to figure it out, although it was counterintuitive.

I was looking for the widest (24mm) with good zoom (20x optical) in a compact camera.  However, that said, when using \"intelligent auto\" (I'm not a \"true' camera person & don't want to do my own settings all the time), the shutter speed is still too slow to do well with pets/moving objects.  (It still doesn't do well on shutter priority, so the best option is the sports mode, which still isn't perfect/not always fast enuf to catch the pic w/o blur.)But more importantly, color is just not as true/great as my Canon.  Also, on the screen, if the exposure looks perfect, however, when I look at it on my computer screen, it's a bit too dark.  So I have to shoot for slightly exposed pic to get it right.  I do love the small size & many features & great zoom, but disappointed with overall pictures.  As other reviews have stated, it does better outdoors, not so good indoors & flash is not that strong.  I don't know if it's just a function of the price range of this camera or if I should have gone with a canon/nikon instead.  (Panasonic makes great electronics/products otherwise.)P.S.  If u buy this, DO get the separate extra battery pack & charger combo.  The charger that it comes with is very flimsy and takes forever (the first one shipped with camera came broken) and if going sightseeing all day, one charge may not last you all day if you take a lot of pictures or do videos.UPDATE:  I downgraded my review.  I can't stand this camera.  I tried to get a pic of the roses in my garden.  It was ok for individual roses.  But when taking picture of the whole bush/garden, I tried morning sun, midday, and evening.  All looked washed out/anemic on IA, even on \"happy\" which is supposed to give the colors more punch.  My sister, who unbeknownst to me bought the same camera, also has problems with the zoom not working all the time, then camera freezes and won't take any pictures.  I'm giving up.UPDATE:  Tried \"like-new\" Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V,  The colors indoors are much better than the Lumix, but the same outdoor garden rose's color still does NOT look true to life, rats!  I'm going back to Canon.  Also the control dial especially & other parts of the camera seemed cheap/flimsy for an otherwise good camera.UPDATE:  Bought Canon PowerShot SX700 HS, 9.5 oz.  (Canon Powershot SX50 hs got best reviews but at 19.4 oz, I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera.)  Colors slight-moderately better than Sony Cybershot.  Low light is still a bit of a problem, but there's a simple fix, \"Live\" option on the dial, where you can make adjustments for 3 things - light/vividness of color/cool vs warm color.  (The \"low light\" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light.)  I do miss having a panoramic option, but I find I tend to do a movie in that case anyway.  The camera body is solid/well constructed.  You do have to use a button to pop up the flash when prompted, but it does save on battery life.  Overall, has been the best so far picture-wise.  (FYI, I also considered it's major competitor, Nikon Coolpix S9700, supposedly got better reviews on picture quality but too many negative reviews on the flash breaking & other glitches/problems made me shy away.)", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes very good photos, new on board charging great, video is outstanding...  issue - black stuff showing up on inside of lens", "Author": "cjs", "ReviewID": "RCSQHX1WQZDJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had three of the DMC cameras, they shoot very good photos and video.

Not only have I taken thousands of pictures with them, I treat them somewhat roughly and they continue to work. One of my cameras has been dropped so many times that it looks like someone took a hammer to it. Outside of a slightly sticky lens (easy to manually pop open), it continues to perform like a champ.This camera is a significant improvement over all the others. The 20x telephoto is mind boggling. It provides a significant enhancement over the 16x lens, offering me a greater variety of views. The shutter also seems more responsive.I primarily use the iA setting, which lets the camera do the thinking while I'm enjoying shooting. If I need to make adjustments, I do so in Photoshop. There are several features on this camera, however, that I have not yet used, the most interesting of which is the panorama mode and \"baby pictures.\"I own a Canon 5000 SLR and have ceased to use it as my Panasonic Lumixs are easier to carry and use with a powerful telephoto. The Canon SLR, however, has a much faster shutter, which allows a photographer to immediately capture what is seen (such as a child's cute expression), rather than suffer through a slight lag between the time the shutter button is pushed and when the camera actually takes the picture. With this limitation in mind, the new 20x functionality lets you take absolutely awesome candid pictures of people who are a great distance from you.

However in good light (out door and sunny) the IQ is much much better.One thing that I find most annoying is the focusing.  I took one shot of the bird, it turn it's head so I still aim my camera waiting for it to turn  back... when the bird did I press the button and the focus go through the whole process over which take so long that the bird have time to turn away again.  Why does ZS19 have to go out of focus and refocus again?  It already had the focus.  A simple check and it should see it's still in focus.I wish there is a way to hack this camera to get more control of the functions, like increase the shutter speed to 1 min for night scene with tripod.  Or increase the HDR to provide a wider range.I had been intensely using this camera, but I am not impress.  I don't think this improve much over my old FH20.

Despite being kept in a protective case in my wife's purse, the camera lens was slightly dented and it affects the lens cover and some minor movement of the lens as it extends and retracts.The repair facility called it user damage (and it is) and wanted $180 to repair.  I don't think I'm sinking another $180 to repair it ... I'd rather put that money toward something else that is perhaps a little more durable.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic dented my camera while it was in for repair and wants me to pay for their damage", "Author": "B. Baniszewski \"Beth\"", "ReviewID": "R3BLXSVYO2D4YA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got a Panasonic camera last year for Christmas, and I just wanted to warn everyone about my terrible customer service experience.  I was very happy with how such nice optics fit in such a small package.  A few weeks ago, I noticed that the flash wasn't working and the mode indicator dial wouldn't always register the correct position.  Since the camera was still under warranty, I sent it in for repairs.I got a call from Panasonic a week later telling me that the warranty was void because of a small dent on the camera's mode indicator dial, and since the dent was in one of my problem areas, they claimed the warranty was void.  There was no dent when I sent the camera in for repairs.Panasonic said that it is their policy to keep the packaging of any package which looks like it was damaged in shipping.  They did not keep the packaging for my camera, since it had shown no signs of damage.  I talked to a number of people at the post office, and they also had no record of damage.  The only logical conclusion left was that the camera was damaged at Panasonic's repair facility.Panasonic, of course, insists they do not damage cameras, and that it is not possible for a camera to be even accidentally damaged at their facility.  They told me several times they would have a manager call me back to speak to me about the situation.  No one ever did.  Every time I called again, I was told the manager was unavailable.  I got no help from anyone at their support center.  I only got brushed off.My camera had no dent when I sent it in.  It was sitting untouched on a table between the last time I used it and the time I noticed it was malfunctioning.  Panasonic treated my camera negligently at their facility. Now they want to charge me more than the cost of the camera to have it repaired, when it should still be under warranty.Panasonic sold me an unreliable product, damaged it further instead of repairing it, and gave me terrible customer service.

The lense is the ticket!I can set the f-stop at  8 (which is the smallest aperature you can get on this camera) but that is better than the automatic cameras taking almost everything at f-2.8.I'm hooked.

I had a Lumix before, and returned it for a Canon, and it looks like I'm going to be doing the same thing again. I purchased this camera refurbished, so perhaps that has something to do with my bad experience, but I really did not like the pictures from this camera, and the screen on it is HORRID.That's the biggest problem for me - the screen. Again, I bought a refurbished item and that may have something to do with it - but when I took a picture, and went to review it on this camera, the image on the LCD display was so terrible - extremely over sharpened, pixelated and noisy. The screen was also laggy/choppy. The image on the LCD screen also changed drastically from what I saw while taking the pic vs. what I saw after the pic was taken. What I saw BEFORE was darker and more true to color - and what I saw after was very washed out. What I saw on the computer matched neither. It was impossible to tell if I had captured an in-focus picture. Honestly, pictures displayed on the camera looked nothing like the actual picture I took once I viewed it on the computer. The images are much better on the computer, but they are still way too noisy, and I just didn't like photos from this camera. Because there is no viewfinder, not one picture I took was focused where I had wanted - it appeared so on the crappy LCD screen, but once loaded onto the computer and the image wasn't being over-sharpened and pixelated, the areas I focused on were blurry. Because of this, I just can't recommend this camera, even if the images it produces would most likely please the average user - you just have to take a picture and hope it's in focus...You also cannot use the full zoom function unless you are in full auto mode. Switching out of auto mode, if you zoom at all, it is digital zoom. This seems incredible to me, and really - not right. I wonder if the camera I received was damaged, because if you can really ONLY use the 20x optical zoom in Auto mode, what is the point? In auto mode this camera seriously wanted to jack up the ISO which is why most of my pictures were so noisy - but I couldn't use the zoom function in any other mode.The macro mode on this camera is it's only saving grace for me - it takes very good close-ups, and using the manual mode to take them produces pretty good results (when you can keep the ISO at 400 or lower). However, I find this laughable, because I bought the camera for the zoom and not the macro - I have another camera for that already.Lastly, this camera has a touch screen - touch to focus - which worked maybe 10% of the time?I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I'm baffled really by all of the good reviews, and my only hunch is that maybe my camera was damaged. If you do purchase this camera, get it NEW.

Windows can open jpeg pictures but not videos. You have to use Panasonic's own software which is the poorest, most user unfriendly I have ever encountered. Even downloading videos that look good on the Panasonic software to PC, once there windows or apparently no other software can open them. Every-time you download using Panasonic you have to check or uncheck each individual picture or video to select which will download. It does not offer option of downloading only pics that have not previously been downloaded (like every other software on the market). Think about large SD cards with hundreds of photos; that's hundreds of checks/unchecks. Canon offers just as good point and shoot with decent software. Also you can download Canon pic/video using windows if you want.I owned previous Lumix ZX4 that did not have this problem.

It is $299 at all the other local stores, I had done my research and this was my first choice, so when I saw it at this bundled price, I snapped it up!  Two guys at the store said it's an awesome device, and considering it was one of the least expensive there, I don't consider it a sales push. They also said it's the camera they use at the store to take pics of store merchandise.With that being said, I don't have much to say about the camera itself yet, as we have it charging now. From playing with it at the store, it focuses much more quickly than some of the others I picked up. I like the touchscreen focus too. The size + zoom ability is one of it's biggest pros, as anything else with a 20x zoom is much larger.  This camera will easily fit in my purse or jacket pocket.
