It's size will let you fit it in your shirt pocket, but it can be a little too heavy to carry  there, so get a small case.Battery life is \"EXCELLENT\" with 2300ma (KODAK Brand)rechargeables. I have taken 20 mins of video and 30 pictures with the screen on, and the battery light is still green. I took 41 flash photos in a row on a fresh charge and the battery light was still green! That is pretty darn good for a camera with only two batteries! I haven't yet had to put in fresh batteries during a day of shooting family photos and movies.The movie mode is superb ( I no longer use my old camcorder) and has  good sound capture. Outdoor movies look great, but your inside movies will need some good lighting to obtain adequate quality (remember, it has no camera light like your camcorder.) Movies are recorded in Quicktime (mov) format. If you want to transfer them to dvd for tv viewing, you will need to convert them since most dvd players don't support that format. Kodak software does an avi conversion, but it turned out very poor.  Upgrading to Quicktime Pro seems to be the easiest way to make the conversion to other formats. (about $29). Kodak software needs more work. The mov to avi conversion is ridiculous. Very basic control over photo editing. More focused on printing than digital storage.The photos, however, are stunning. Great Kodak picture color.The viewfinder is slightly offset,and doesn't fully represent what you will get in your photo.The C643 has some problems with autofocus when doing macro shots.I had extreme difficulty locking in doing closeups (less than 2ft).The camera has a \"handshake\" logo that pops up when the camera isn't steady enough. Steady photography seems to be an issue with all small point and shoot cameras that use 3x plus zoom. You have to make sure to either use a tripod or rest the camera or your hand against something to obtain good shots in high zoom.  All cameras with zoom have that issue unless there is some fancy image stabilization circuity ( which can add another hundred or so bucks to the price.)The camera build is a little cheap. I do not like the quality of the card door or battery compartment door.  The usb cable is a little difficult to plug in.The menu is easy, the screen is very big and useful unless the summer sun is shinning directly into it. The zoom is fluid, and with 6.1mp, even the digital zoom is sharp.I like the shutter Long Term Exposure mode. It will allow you to open the shutter for up to 4 secs. That can get you some real fun shots at night!If you get this camera, I recommend getting the Kodak camera dock.  It not only comes with two rechargeable batteries, but will make transfers and recharging simpler, and save wear and tear on the cheap doors.  Also get a 1GB card, because you will end up taking a lot of video with this camera.NOTE TO THOSE HAVING CAMERA PROBLEMS......USE THE KODAK RECHARGEABLE BATTERY RECOMMENDED FOR THIS UNIT.  You will only meet with grief if you try to use a standard alkaline battery. They do not provide the correct amount of current capacity needed and will cause lockups, unexpectant shutdowns, etc.  Even other brand name rechargeables may cause issues.  Before you take the camera back to the store, purchase the Kodak battery pack with the recharger kit.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Quality far exceeds the price!", "Author": "Susann Simpson", "ReviewID": "R1VLKJWE14MFWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say is WOW!We're going to Alaska in July. We have a 2 year old Fujifilm S3000 3.2 mega pixel already, but after much deliberation we decided to indulge ourselves and purchase the Kodak C643 in addition to a new digital camcorder to tape our four boys during our excursions. I've played around with it for 2 weeks and feel I'm qualified now to review it.PROS:The LCD screen is HUGE! I've saved so much time being able to preview photos in detail and delete off the bad ones immediately instead of downloading them onto my laptop to review and delete. Great time saver! The built in memory is large enough that we can use it now while we're still pricing out 1g or 2g SD cards.It took about 5 minutes to get the hang of the menu, which is incredibly easy to use. The controls buttons are large enough for my hands, and are far enough apart as to not hit another accidentally.Camera cropping is something I was unfamiliar with, but I've already come to love it. You can easily adjust the white balance and ISO speed manually.The burst feature takes four shots in 2 seconds which is impressive. (Very important when trying to capture birthday candle blowing!)The sepia and B/W effects are realistic and by far my favorites.I've played around with the long time exposure feature and gotten some REALLY neat effects. It's lightweight and small enough to fit in my purse or pocket but large enough that even my slightly shaky hands are able to take sharp photos.  The photo clarity is amazing. Colors are vibrant and rich. The zoom moves rapidly. Flash is bright, with multiple flash options to chose from.The slide show feature lets me show the kids the photos I've taken automatically without worrying about them accidentally deleting every photo on the memory card. (Been there, cried about that!) It also has an UNDO DELETE feature. I guess I don't need to say anything more about that, do I?  I've taken a few movies and they've come out surprisingly well, although I confess haven't used that feature much since I've also been playing around with my new digital camcorder.CONS:The user guide STINKS! The book is nice and fat but that's only because it includes the information in three languages.  It touches on each feature the camera offers, but so briefly that a first time user wouldn't have enough confidence in the information to utilize them properly without fearing irreparable consequences. Don't let this scare you! Play around with the camera! If you screw up, just readjust the levels back to AUTO, and start over again!This camera is absolutely worth more than what we paid!", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Problems with these cameras", "Author": "dee", "ReviewID": "R1KZC903QNZGTJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought mine at target.

I loved this camera.  Well, it stopped working on Christmas Eve.  I used it that morning with no problems, put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening.  When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures.After talking with the customer service folks, I sent my camera in for repair.  It was under warranty, and I had not done anything to break the camera.  Well, they voided my warranty stating that it was \"Impact Damage\" and my repair bill was $111.00.  You have got to be kidding.  I called to question the voided warranty since I had not dropped the camera.  The technician I spoke to explained that \"Impact Damage\" could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse.  So I asked to speak to a manager.I am sorry, but if I am going to spend this much money on a camera, I expect a little better quality.  I have called and email the Kodak Company several times to have someone talk to me.  Nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails.I would SERIOUSLY think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera.

Movies more so than photos. When shooting in-doors try adding some additional light on the subject. The existing light may seem OK to your eyes, but will be a bit dark otherwise.  For what it costs, this is a terrific camera. Sure the body is plastic, and the USB port is tiny, and it's kind of small.

It is very easy to use. I agree with a previous review which says the user guide is a bit confusing. I read some of it, then just played with the camera taking pictures of my dog and yard until I learned. The features are nice, and it takes great photos. And I'm able to have video of my three month old granddaughter cooing and smiling. Since we live 700 miles apart, it's very important to get my daily fix of her, and it's simple to transfer photos and videos to my laptop. Now, my disclaimer...I am NOT an old grandmother, I'm just 49 years young, so that's not why I say I like the ease of this camera. It suits all of my photographic needs. In fact, I am getting the same model for my mom for Christmas. With two new great-granddaughters this year (my sister became a GiGi 6 weeks after I did)  mom needs to stop wasting money on disposable camers resulting in lousy photos, and take some good photographs of these baby girls.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "6.1 megapixels for less than $ 150", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1B6N5P9EDFD1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera this summer for $150. For some reason, this camera dropped in price during the summer. I heard that it was being discontinued. This is my 2nd Kodak digital camera. My first one took great pics, so I did not hesitate to buy the 643 model. I took this camera to Ft. Walton, Florida and it took pictures with fantastic color. I tried the long exposure taking pics at the pool during the evening. Those turned out very nice also. I don't use the video much. Any vibration in your hands(s) will show up in the video. My camcorder has Steady Shot to eliminate this. I use a 1 GB memory card which will hold 4,000 pics at 1024x768 resolution. The menu system is easy to navigate through.

He also purchased a separate 1 GB SD card so that I would have enough memory in the camera to store my pictures.  The total purchase price for all these items was about $260.While this might seem like an o.k. price for all the above items, I prefer to think of it as money that could go towards a really decent camera.  With that amount, you could be half-way toward a really excellent digital camera.  This one does not measure up in any way.As noted by other users, the only way you are going to get a decent picture with this camera is if you have perfect lighting.  My Christmas pictures were made indoors, with the usual room lighting and a flash, and it still was not enough.  My pictures were dark, grainy, and full of red eyes that could not even be fixed with my Picasa program that I use for photo editing.  Now that is bad when Picasa can't fix the boo-boos!I am fairly computer savvy, and I had problems getting my computer to \"see\" the camera when it was connected by USB cable.  I finally gave up, pulled out the SD card, and loaded it into my tower via a port that not everyone has on his/her computer.  I was just lucky that I had another way to get the photos out of the camera.Even though I had the software to set up the printer dock, it did not work for me.  I am running Windows XP Media Edition.  My son, who got an EasyShare 500 model this Christmas, also had issues getting his started, so I know there must be some issues.My photos (and I took about 150 pictures) were just horrible.  I thought that maybe when I uploaded them to my computer and even slightly adjusted them, that they would be o.k, but they were not.  It seemed like this camera distorted the subjects, and no one looked good in the pictures.  The flash is very bright and caused lots of people to close their eyes when shooting closeups.In short, I expected more from this C633, seeing that it was not the bare bones model offered by Kodak.  I have a Sony Mavica which is about 5 or 6 years old and copies on to hard cd roms which you can then just insert into your cd drive.  I will admit I am spoiled.  It is a rather large camera (they make smaller ones now) and I was looking for something I could drop in my purse for easier use.  However, if the end product is going to be some useless photos, I will stick with my old camera or perhaps look into the newer Canon Rebel digital camera.

I am not that savvy when it comes to electronics so if something is not simple enough for me, I get easily frustrated. I knew I wanted to stay with the Kodak name and after a few weeks of comparing products in my price range I went with the C643. When it arrived, I was happy with the size-which is small enough to fit in a pocket and it's not  bulky either. I put my rechargable batteries in, popped in my memory card and was able to figure out how to use it without even opening the book. I took it to the zoo the next day to take some shots to get used to how it works and was amazed at how simple it is to use. It guides you in taking pictures and tells you which setting to use for different conditions (beach, action, etc) and all my shots came out great.

Macro mode is better than one would expect from camera in this range. Other advantages are that it uses AA batteries and SD card (with 32MB internal memory).

I bought this camera to replace my Canon Digital ELPH because it was inexpensive and has a lot of megapixels.  You definitely get what you pay for.  The camera is very light, which is not a good thing.  It's made of cheap plastic.  The pictures it takes are of very low quality.  The flash makes objects appear washed out, even when the subject is 10 feet away.  Low-light pictures are awful.  They turn out with a brown tinge.  My four-year-old Canon could make low-light pictures look not too bad.In short, pay a couple of extra bucks and buy a Canon.

I guess we'll have to contact Kodak directly and see if they can fix this.The printer had a terrible time simply grabbing the paper from the tray, I had to fiddle with it for an hour before getting the first one to print.Other than that, yeah, the photos look pretty good (when the camera decides to work) and the printouts look pretty good (when the printer decides to print).

Goding", "ReviewID": "R1077X9L5TSO35", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas 2006. So far, I have used it numerous times and in many various situations. I wouldn't say that it is the best quality out there, but for people on a budget and without spending tons of money on something, the quality is great. i have used it with and without the printer dock. The printer dock takes a while to print a picture but other than that the dock is fairly easy to use and it \"finds\" your camera once it's loaded and with the press of a few buttons you can choose what size pic you want to print and how many copies. It's pretty user friendly overall. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that, the manuals aren't great to understand. it takes some reading and time to figure them out. As for the camera itself, I really have enjoyed using it. I have taken it on many trips, including Disney World, and New England in the fall. In the fall, I captured many fantastic pics and while driving in a car, the quality of the photo was pretty decent considering we were driving 70mph and with a glare on the window. I like the different settings there are depending upon night, movement, snow, beach, etc. Those really do make the pic better. My biggest complaint is it didn't capture the magnificence of the fall foliage colors as they are in person. I had to tweak my photos with my computer to make them brighter and with more contrast to bring out the color. The camera is real user friendly with the menu buttons and video portion especially for older parents (like mine) not from a technological era like myself. They find easy to use. It doesn't capture night photos that well even on the night feature. I have had to take some pics over and over again to capture just one thing. It also takes a lot longer for a night photo to flash, and you have to hold the camera real steady the whole time in order for the pic not to come out blurry. Other than that, I have been really happy with my Kodak camera and it's a great camera for those just starting in digital photography, those who aren't real technologically savvy, or those kids who want a camera without all the complicated buttons etc. If you purchaase the rechargeable batteries, the camera will last a long time. When I was in New england, I used my camera almost continuously off and on for about 2 days before I had to recharge. I also purchased a 2 GB SD card and reduced the resolution on the camera and I was able to take over 2000 photos and videos. I agree with other reviewers in that the sound on the video is surprisingly good. I didn't think it would be, but at Disney, I taped some performances and even from a far distance with the zoom in place the sound was really good. I uploaded to my computer, and I can literally relive the shows like I am there all over again. The quality of the photos when printed is also very good compared to some of my older version cameras. I would definitely recommend this camera, especially if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars or more and don't want buttons to confuse you to the point your camera spends its days on a lonely dusty shelf :( And who wants a lonely camera??
