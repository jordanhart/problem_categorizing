Mcclung \"ncbill\"", "ReviewID": "R1AK2BMJ9BPF2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "31 DEC 04:  Let me preface this review with a little personal history.  I have been taking photographs for 53 years and ran a part-time wedding photography business for 24 years.  I fought the change to digital for years, but finally succumbed in 2002.  Since that time, I have never looked back.  The Digilux 2 is my sixth digital camera and I can honestly say it takes better photographs than any of my other cameras, including my Nikon D-100.  The Nikon is more flexible, with interchangable lenses, but the Leica is much more portable and intuitive.Some might complain that the camera is \"only\" a five megapixel unit.  But, there are megapixels and there are megapixels....not all are created equal.  The CCD on the Digilux 2 is very large, providing larger megapixels.  This solves a lot of problems currently being experienced by high-megapixel \"pro-sumer\" cameras and creates stunning photographs.Having used range-finders and other \"analog\" cameras for many years, the Leica is like an old friend.  There is no other digital camera on the market that is easier to use, when switching from \"automatic\" to manual or shutter/f-stop priority.  This camera is usable by everyone, from a beginner (just go \"full auto\", until you learn more about the camera's capabilities) to a professional.The Digilux 2 is built like a tank and will stand years of service and abuse.  The LCD is HUGE, as well as being the clearest and brightest I have ever seen.  It's usable even in bright sunlight.  The built-in straight or bounce flash capability is extremely useful.My only complaint is that Leica should have made the switch from \"Autofocus\" to \"Autofocus-Macro\" a little stiffer.  It's easy to move the switch and not be aware that you have done so (if you set the display to show the switch position, it is easy to check through the viewfinder before you take the shot).  With all the other things going for it, I will not let that minor thing keep me from giving the camera a full five stars.If you can afford it, the Digilux 2 will serve you well for many years.UPDATE (5 JAN 05):  Now that I have used this camera for a longer period of time, I would like to add some additional thoughts/information, based on that usage.  (1) Because of the weight, configuration, minimum shutter lag, and lack of \"monkey motion\" (flipping mirrors, etc.), it is extremely easy to hand-hold the Digilux 2 at low shutter speeds that would be impossible with digital SLRs or most other digital cameras.  Check out the sample photos on this site, many of them taken hand-held at 1/20th - 1/25th sec. (2) The depth-of-field is amazing, even at F-2.0.  (3) The \"out-of-the-camera color is the best of any digital camera I have ever owned or used, including top-of-the-line SLRs.  (4) The custom white balance settings are quick, easy, and spot on.  (5) The tonal values, when the camera is set on B&W; are outstanding.  (6) Contrast is also outstanding.  BOTTOM LINE:  I am in love!.UPDATE 2 MAR 05:  Check out the two new photos I have added.  The landscape photo has been enlarged to 16 x 20 by a custom shop the level of detail is incredible (even the horses at the bottom right of the photo have amazing detail).  This camera has an OUTSTANDING lens/sensor combination.", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "The Difference Between Photography and Just Taking Pictures", "Author": "Leitz Fan \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R1CH0ZV56EQI3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very much an amateur who had been using one of the older S series 2 megapixel  Canon Digital Elph cameras for several years. Recently, I decided to upgrade, and considered purchasing the 7 megapixel Power Shot S70 before instead opting to move not only up in megapixels but also over into the realm of true photography. After some careful research concerning the tools I'd need,I stepped up and bought a Digilux 2.In a word, it is awesomeThe bottom line here is that is that most amateurs who tote along a digital camera to take some pictures on holiday seem to think that megapixels are everything.This is a flawed mindset, for several reasons. First, assuming that all you want are some snapshots to serve as memories or to email to your friends and relatives, then a modestly priced 3 megapixel miniature model will serve quite nicely. Viewed on a typical computer screen or printed out as small pics, the subtlties of fidelity in image reproduction that pro and semi-pro reviewers go into on any of the plethora of available websites will typically go unnoticed to the rank amateur. If this is your cup of tea, then spending $1500+ for any digital camera, much less one with, gasp, ONLY 5 megapixels will seem and be totally unnecessary.But if it's photography you wish to persue, then realize first and foremost that unless you want to produce really large prints, provided you have a reasonable minimum of 4 megapixels or so, that image quality doesnt come from megapixels but from the photographer and the lens. All the megapixels in the universe can not and will not make up for the limitations of a mediocre or miniaturized lens (or a poor artist) After all, your system will ultimately always be limited by its weakest component.The best trained doctor cant perform quality microsurgery with a rusty butter knife, even if he is trying to do so in the world's highest tech operating roomAnd when it comes to glass, Leica Summicron simply has no peer. Every digital camera I had ever worked with or whose output I had seen typically produced pictures that were somehow, \"soft\", is the best way to describe it. Until the Digilux 2. The color fidelity, sharpness, and overall OOMPH of the images produced by this lens are incomparable. I dont know the exact words to describe the technical reasons for this, but I suggest that if you are considering this camera, then find someone who has one, and take ANY prosumer level digital camera of your choice along and do side by side comparisons of pictures taken with the two. You'll either appreciate the difference or you wont. If you dont, then stop right here. If you do, you'll buy a Digilux 2 post-haste.I guarantee it!The pros -1.First and foremost, the lens and the incomparable image quality it renders.2.Next, the LCD. Most cameras have one that leaves you guessing at best as to what kind of picture you've REALLY taken. This one is big enough to not leave this to guesswork. The biggest overall advantage to digital photography is the ability to see what you've got and if need be, discard the pic and shoot again without having to wait for your developed film. This advantage is lost if your LCD leaves you guessing.3.Elegant and functional ergonomics, logical menus, and silky smooth (if occasionally frustratingly slow) operations. Traditionalists will immediately take to the, well, traditional, setting rings on the lens. Refined might be the best adjective to use here. The camera has a simple but stylish \"retro\" look and a solid and quality feel to the all the components including the body itself.4. The bounce flash feature is neat. Not $1500 neat in and of itself, but a nice touch that helps remind you of the difference between high end and the everydayThe cons1.The lack of a RAW buffer means that the camera must finish writing one RAW file before you can shoot the next. Even with the fastest SD cards currently available, this means your rapid sequance capabilities will be rather severely limited in RAW mode (Figure 5 seconds or so between shots) Remember what I said about a system being limited by its worst component? This IS the Achilles heel of this camera IMHO.2. It's BIG. For someone used to the ease and unobtrusiveness of a pocket sized-miniature, I am still trying to find the best way to tote it around and not feel a little laden down.3. There are some hidden expenses. You can buy one from a Leica dealer at around $1500 delivered, but figure to be into the system for a little over $2000 when it's said and done a.You'll need to spend some dough to buy two SD cards with the speed and capacity to do justice to this camera. At least 512, and better yet 1 Gig. One to use and a backup is worth the expense to ensure that a card malfunction doesnt ever shut you down for the day. And if you even think you might want to explore the possibilities of shooting RAW, you'll need a fast card like the Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme III, or you'll find that transfer times are way too long. Figure $150-$250 for two good fast cards b. You will also want to buy a UV filter, if for nothing else than to protect that magnificent lens. Leica sizes are such that you cant expect to walk into any run-of-the-mill camera shop and find one (I actually had an employee of a well known retail chain look at me like I was from Mars when I told him I needed a 69mm filter, claiming that no such beast existed). Filters can be found of course, and can be had for $60 or $70, but if you want to go with Leica brand, it'll be $100-$120. Compare this to $15 or so for an off-brand filter in a more standard size.c. For macro work, you'll want a cable release to overcome the problem of camera shake. The Leica Cr-DC1 will run you $75-$90d. A small tripod ($20 or less for a table mount model) is money well spent.e. An extra Leica BP-DC1 battery for the same reason you carry an extra SD card - $30-$40f. An external flash unit for the more serious. The Leica SF-24D runs $250-$300g. A cardreader - The Digilux uses a standard size SD card. A one function reader can be as cheap as $10. One that has ports for any memory device currently available is around $35These little extras are individually trivial compared to the cost of the camera, but they do add up.On a side note, I dont personallly see much need for a digital wallet, or image tank, as they are otherwise known. Yes it's a backup copy of your images, but if you paranoid about losing pics to corrupted date files, you can usually find a copy shop or somesuch that'll burn your stuff to disc for $10 or so4. The electronic viewfinder is subpar compared to the rest of the camera. For those used to using one, it may well prove a disappoitment. I am used to lining up shots using the LCD, so to me, this is not a real issue, save to say that it wouldve been more aesthetically appealing if the rangefinder was of the same quality as the rest of the camera. If this would be a real issue for you, I'd suggest getting an accessory optical finder5.When in autofocus mode, it is very easy to inadvertantly and unknowingly slip it from normal to macro. This typically happens when zooming. A few ruined shots, and it'll be second nature to double check, but it's a pain in the behind6. That gigantic LCD? So big that it can be challenging to handle the camera without occasionally smudging the LCD with finger grease.7. Numerous reviews that I researched were about unanimous in their opinion that image quality was rather badly compromised by noise at ISO 400. I havent yet experimented with that setting8.Some might have an issue with the lack of lens interchangabiltiy in this price range. I for one am convinced, however, that one great lens beats a bagful of also-ransOriginally through Dec 31, 2004, and then extended through the end of January, Leica had program whereby buying a new Digilux entitled you to send in for an extra battery and an external flash unit. The end of that deal corresponded almost exactly with a drop in retail price from the $1700-$1850 range to $1450-$1600. Basically, it's about a washSome folks take issue with the fact that the camera is in fact produced in Japan, and that the electronics are made by Panasonic. To that I say, \"Big deal\" Remember, what you buying here is above all Leica quality glass - whether it's made by a guy who orders his dinner in German or Japanese isnt really importantAs for the version of this camera with the same combo of eletronics and lens but branded Panasonic? It's about $300 cheaper. You are very much paying for the little red dot. But bottom line, the two camera could be identical and yet when it comes to either resale value, collectability (if any digital cameras ever achieve that status) or just prestige - as illogical as it might seem to some, Leica has it, and Panasonic doesnt and wont. Some might argue with me, but I say if you're going to step this far up, then dont not take the last little stepThe competition? I suppose one could cite the Canon Digital Rebel, the Nikon D70, or the Panasonic brand version of the Digilux. Leica would of course say that they HAVE no competition. Follow my advice and take the time to do the legwork to track down a Digilux owner so you can try it out and do some side by side comparison. You'll either \"get it\" or you wont. Either way, your decision to buy or not buy will be clear cut.To sum it up, for the artist, great glass is at the root of outstanding pictures. If you understand this,it might well be the resson you havent yet gone digital. This issue is now moot, provided you can afford the privilege.Only 4 stars and not 5 because it does have a few equivalents of the cup-holders in a BMWAs for this camera becoming obsolete. Advances in technology may forever expand the bounds of what is possible. When this happens, medicority becomes obsolete, and quickly. Quality on the other hand, will forever stand as a classic", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Traditional  Design in the Digital Age", "Author": "kkrome25 \"kkrome25\"", "ReviewID": "R39SQDL6Y833HO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "AESTHETICS: The Leica Digilux 2 can be described as a modern \"retro\" design. The body style is a direct descendant of the M6 and those before it. The body looks huge. It is about 33% larger than an M6, but this isn't readily apparent until you set it next to any Leica M chassis. There is a gaudy overabundance of faux chrome in the back. This is the least appealing part of the camera, because of the chrome finish that surrounds and accentuates the presence of the LCD monitor.  I would have preferred a more predominant use of either a black finish or the faux leather.  The rubber around the eyepiece is bulbous, but acceptable. Overall, it is a handsome camera.ERGONOMICS: What sold me are the traditional manual adjustments:  The focusing ring, the aperture ring, zoom adjustment, and shutter speed dial are so much more workable in the field. You do not have to take your eye away from the viewfinder like you would with touch pads and four-way rocker switches.  Leave that for reviewing the recorded images. The box construction has the familiar feel of an M body, but weighs less. The \"grippy\" black rubber finish is handsome and remotely resembles leather. The flash has two positions: press halfway and it will set up for bounce flash. Press all the way down, and it will point directly towards the subject.PRACTICALITIES: At the average price of about $1850 U.S. dollars, one would have to factor in the name.  But also figure in the build quality. There is the magnesium body, real metal hinges on the doors (which are designed beautifully), traditional aperture ring, manual & auto focusing, shutter speed dial, superior image processing (for markedly lower noise levels than the competition), aspherical Summicron lens, larger than average lcd monitor; and a few more, but the general impression is that it's built well.  The baseplate is bare, but there are three 1/8\" diameter round rubber feet, and one round plastic foot that is molded out of the battery door itself. Attention to small details are what I like about the Leica. For example, the camera strap also comes with two leatherette scuff protectors that fit around the camera strap eyelets. And not only is a lens cap included, but a lens cap for the lens shade.THE BOTTOM LINE:  The photographs are the bottom line.  The images and image quality are on par with the pro-level dslr's. There is a real Summicron aboard this camera, and of it, I rest assured.  There are and will be cameras with higher pixel counts, but I've come to realize that if most of my photographs will be printed smaller than 11\" x 14,\" then I am not lacking with the five megapixels. I've compared identical images side by side with images from my Olympus C8080, and the Digilux 2's images can almost qualify as 8 megapixel images!! Magnify both the C8080 & the Digilux 2's images to 200%, and the Leica wins convincingly. This is not a point-and-shoot, as most would regard it as such. It can be set up for that if you wish, but the manual focusing, aperture and shutter adjustments make the D2 a capable tool for anybody who pursues photography seriously.", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Worth the price if...", "Author": "Mark Tokola", "ReviewID": "R101D6IPB88RO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read every review I could find of the Leica D2 and still had qualms about buying one.  Having received it and used it, I can now say that it was the right purchase.  Others have commented on the D2's outstanding picture quality (don't go by the number of megapixels alone, the quality of the lens is at least as important).  What I'll add is that the D2's lens is so fast that you can take almost any reasonably lit indoor picture without using the flash -- a major plus for natural-looking pictures.  I'm not as impressed by the ergonomics of Leica's traditional brick-with-a-lens shape as other reviewers, but the ease of use and solid feel of all of the controls more than make up for that.The key point is that within the first half-hour of using the D2, I was paying more attention to the pictures I was taking than to the camera itself -- which is what I imagine Leica had in mind when they designed this great camera.  Is the D2 worth what it costs?  Not if you would only take it out of the drawer for holiday and vacation snapshots.  But, if you are the kind of photographer who often grabs the camera on the way out the door just to take pictures, it is well worth the price.

The Director in Us ---- Personally, I'm a filmmaker --- I'm not crazy about cinematography, and for me, I know enough about cameras to take it seriously, but at the end of the day, I see it as a personal hobby ------ this is OUR kind of camera ------ no interchangable lenses to deal with and complete manuel controls2. Lense ----- the lense is terrific, and Leica glass is awesome ---- I'm having a good time looking at all the pics I took over my iPhoto, and there a clear difference between my Nikon/Sony pics versus the Leica ----- however, as mentioned, the lense is NOT changable ------ for me, I like this because I'm not interested in carrying 5 lenses to a bunch of locations ------ but for true photographers, this is a problem - so keep that in mind3. RINGS!!!!!!! ----- Rings for ZOOM, Aperture, and FOCUS ---- I'm in hog heaven!!! There is nothing on this camera that isn't controlled manually, whether it be the rings, the shutter speed, or anything else ----- that is the best part!!!! With the exception of White Balance, I think everything is contolled by either a switch or a ring - which is neat!4. On Board Light Meter ------ the light meter here is adjustable and very accurate ---- I depended on it whenever I set the aperture, and was very pleased with the results ---- in addition, if you hate the pic, you can always erase it5. Stability ---- I shot all day in 4 fps and 2 fps shutter speed modes, and impressively, the camera never showed any blurred lines, provided that I held it still (however, I didn't have to stand like a statue)6. CloseUps ----- closeups were great ----- the focus could probably focus anything in front of me, probably anything that is farther than six inches or more7. BURST shooting ---- you can set the camera to shoot in bursts of 3 or 5 ---- this is a fun mode and works well with the camera8. FLASH ---- I can't stand digital cameras with flashes that are way too strong ---- the flash on this is simple, quick, and not very strong ---- but good enough to produce great imaging9. COMPRESSION ---- I took most of my pics in the LOWEST compression of JPEG, and they are beautiful -- most of them are less than one megabyte in size and very nice looking ---- in comparison, the high compression pics do look better, but there isn't much differenceAre there cons? For some, one lense is a con, but not for me ------- I shot all my pics in JPEG (my fav format) but I hear that the RAW can be slow ---- when shooting in JPEG, the camera was very fast to write each pic and move onDon't let the 5 megapixel thing scare you ----- the pictures are gorgeous!I even tried the latest Rebel by Canon today, and I'm just glad that I picked the LeicaDid I also mention that this camera just looks COOL too???I'm just having too much fun with all of the manual settings at my disposalHighly recommended for the Liebowitz in all of us!", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great learning tool / very cool camera !", "Author": "Alvin Soedarjo", "ReviewID": "RTZRPNXJ8CRWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Leica Digilux 2 is one of the best digital cameras on the market, if not the best.

So had been thinking of getting a DSLR (e.g. Nikon D100) for a while but quite simply liked the aesthetic appeal of a Leica but in digital format (Digilux 1 was just too weak). Made the jump to the Digilux 2 for a number of reasons - slightly smaller than a DSLR, Leica lens (speed and sharpness), image contrast and definition, look and feel. Despite the hurdle of the expense - and it is comparably expensive - this is an awesome camera. For sure, you could technically get more quality/value per se in a DSLR for same price or less but is just isn't the same as the feel of the Leica. This is really the first time in the digital space that I feels like I'm using a \"real\" camera again.Pro's :- Fast extremely high quality lens- Wonderful and intuitive manual-like controls for good \"flow\"- Unless you're into action photography the RAW write lock times on a fast SD card (e.g. Sandisk Ultra II) is hardly noticable.- Large LCD screen for good previews- Actually not a bad EVF - despite what some of the reviews have said. Cons:- Expensive for what it is. Personally, I think it's worth an extra few 100 bucks for the feel of this camera..just makes you want to take more pictures.- Supplied software, especially RAW conversion is terrible. Only practial way to do RAW properly is with raw plug-in for Photoshop  CS- RAW mode also stores a JPEG on the card, which is odd. It's useful in that you can preview stuff quicker, although with CS file browser you can do this anyway.

The camera is mostly metal rather than plastic and has a two tone silver and black markings.  It's built like a tank & beautiful to behold. (However, some photographers prefer the less flashy solid black color of the Panasonic DMC-LC1 twin and roll their eyes at the Digilux 2's attempt to imitate the look of the classic \"Leica Rangefinder\" camera.Leica warranty and repair are of a very high quality and are unmatched in the industry;Given that the Digilux 2 represents one of the first attempts by Leica to produce a digital camera, the look of the photographs it produces and the limited production run, this camera may become a collectors item.The camera garners much attention from others that may be familiar with the Leica brand or history (quite a conversation starter);Cons:High price.  At first glance, the Panasonic twin (DMC-LC1) is a much better deal (At the time of this review, it's 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of a Leica) if you're willing to forgo the \"red dot\" and put up with a bit more plastic.Unusual sized 69 millimeter camera lens width means that third party lens-filters are rare and expensive.  Limited types of Leica lens filters are available, but are insanely expensive.What other limited Leica accessories are available are very, very expensive compared to the cost of accessories for other brand cameras.The camera garners much attention from others that may be familiar with the Leica brand or history (quite a conversation starter);The camera has point & shoot features and specifications, but it's big & heavy compared to the typical point & shoots.  It wont fit in your pocket (unless you wear \"Joey Butafuco\" clown pants).  Also, for those still unashamed to wear \"butt packs\", you'd need one the size of \"Grandma's purse\" to carry this camera around in.  If you want to do more \"unobtrusive\" photography, the DLux 3 is the Leica to get.Full Review:I've owned a Leica Digilux 2 for two years.  The camera has very high quality construction. More metal than plastic.  It has an amazing lens that can't be purchased apart from the camera body.  Most color and all B & W images have a \"Leica\" look. Even the die-hard Leica film camera fans  have to admit there is something special about the photographs this camera produces.It's overpriced compared to its Panasonic twin (Panasonic DMC-LC1) and other brand cameras with similar feature, so I initially regretted my purchase.  The camera sensor broke after two years of very easy use. Apparently, a good number of the Digilux 2's had sensors installed that did not meet Leica's quality control requirements. A good number of them are now failing.  Fortunately, Leica is repairing the malfunction free of charge.  They appear to be doing so for all of the Digilux 2 cameras even if they are out of warranty, were purchased on the grey-market or if they were purchased second-hand.  As of today, Panasonic with the same sensors in the DMC-LC1 is not providing this level of protection and hassle free repair.  I can't think of any Japanese, Korean or American company that would provide this type of protection to their customers and their reputation.  For this reason, I no longer regret spending the extra money for the Leica camera.Some reviews complain about the viewfinder and LCD image quality.  I wasn't happy with the resolution either, until I realized that the little dial on the side of the viewfinder provides a way to adjust the resolution and focus of the viewfinder image.  After reading the instruction manual and making a slight adjustment, I find the view finder more than adequate.  I suspect that some reviewers may not have read the instruction manual and made this adjustment before writing their review.The Leica lens has a non-standard width of 69mm.  This means that third party lens filters are almost nonexistent and expensive even if you manage to find one. Forget about finding a non-Leica lens hood.  A third-party adapter ring can bump the filter size up to a more standard 72mm or 77mm size, however I've found that non-Leica brand filters (even the expensive ones) seem to degrade the quality of the photographs too much.There are third-party wireless flash triggers and wireless shutter controls available that work with the camera and that are relatively inexpensive.  These help with portrait photography and low light photography and work nicely.  Don't buy the Leica SF24D flash to use with the Digilux 2. It's a fixed-head flash and is very expensive.  Panasonic and Metz make much better flash units for the same or less money that will work well.I would have given the camera five stars if it weren't for the price, and the fact that the sensor failed prematurely for such an expensive camera.  If Leica had not repaired the broken sensor free of charge, I would have given two stars at with a note that the camera would be a wonderful camera but would only work for about two years.  Hope you found this review helpful.12-15-08 Updated review:Leica took over 1 year to repair the broken sensor.  In fact, they lost my camera I sent in for repair and sent me another refurbished one.  Leica digital cameras and their service department are not ready for prime time.  I would change my star rating to 2 stars if I could and would suggest a potential buyer wait 3 or 4 years to see if Leica is still in business before spending money on their cameras.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good but gone", "Author": "M.

I purchased this silent camera new and had issues only at the beginning and end of ownership. My 5mp images could print 16x20 on an Epson 4000 and impress the room, and was willing to wait for each RAW image to process. Traded in my Contax G2 for this Digilux (with mixed feelings but the G2 had an unfaithful viewfinder) but knew it was a step in the right direction. The first Digilux out of box had a bad shutter/on-off mechinism (Barnack turning over in grave). The second lasted me through A LOT of art school craziness, developed some dead pixels in the EVF, survived dropping/flipping between two rocks only to not survive the cold night with me in a tent on Donner Summit. Snow that morning looked beautiful on the cabin but the Digilux would not power up. After a warranty repair, I sold it still in it's plastic from the repair. \"Good-bye old paint, ...\" If it had 6-7mp then, I wouldn't have let go. After this was a swirl of mechanical Leica thread mounts from iiif's to Zorki's, and some SLR's one DSLR but nothing like this Digilux. I don't own a camera now and graduated without one using mostly the images made from this camera early in my college career. These images are still my most cherished compositions that could not be continued with future camera equipment that followed. The likes of Fuji EV-1 and Nikon V1 are trying this EVF design ten years later.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Decade Later- It Reigns", "Author": "Carlton D. Garrard", "ReviewID": "R3FCKLD3I2KLEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've copied my review below from the DMC-LC1 review I just published, since both cameras are extremely similar. The differences in aesthetics, grip, and minor button assignments are minimal, but give the interested party a clear choice. The Jpeg engine of this camera is ever so slightly tuned differently than the LC1, I'd sum up by saying it is more conservative in color saturation and yields slightly better detail. Other than that, they are the same.I've written extensively on this camera and the digilux 2 online on my own blog.This camera and the digilux 2 are considered true classic cameras, and a decade later they still do not disappoint the discerning photographer who embraces the foundation of principles and fundamentals that make photography a rewarding experience.This camera design is truly unique- one of a kind. Dismissed by the masses but embraced by a very niche group of photographers that desire a camera to be both a design first priority, and, a work of art- at the very same time.The lens of this camera, its manual controls, its bright aperture, internal zoom, build quality, and ultimately its excellent performance- are the heart of its lure and soul of its operation. The body style, and external controls compliment this lens design perfectly. Its size is both large enough to operate manually without being cramped, and small enough to be carried anywhere all day long without fatigue in any way.It's sensor is excellent still to this day, 5mp actually translates to the resolution output of many 10mp sensors because of how sharp this lens is. So don't be swayed by that specification. While this camera's operational speed is pedestrian compared to many of today's cameras, its that exact quality which endears it to owners of it. The mere fact that this camera in some ways is inadequate (compared to faster DSLRS) to a variety of shooting circumstances forces the photographer to think his/her way through the process. Thus a shot well done grants the photographer a proud achievement.This is in stark contrast to using a DSLR where shooting a burst of images with a blazing fast autofocus and burst rate yield one good image out of many.It's EVF and LCD are adequate, and with some practice can become intuitive to the shooters needs. The short range of ISO (compared to today's cameras) is also adequate considering the lens fast aperture, and the fact that it yields sharp images wide open. When you do the math you'll see that a comparable DSLR kit would need to use an ISO speed two stops or more higher than this camera to get the same shutter speed.The build quality of this camera, its handling, are first rate. Leica spearheaded its design (both cameras) and Panasonic provided the production capability and electronics. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a Panasonic design first and foremost. Its actually the other way around.This camera and its twin, continue to hold value extremely well. Most digital cameras end up in the trash bin and forgotten, discounted to oblivion, or end up collecting dust in a storage facility. Not the LC1 or Digilux 2.There is a reason for that.No amount of reading will make you understand the draw of this camera. If you like to think when you photograph, if you like to practice photography fundamentals, if you like perfect manual controls, then this camera is probably going to make you very happy.It's as perfect of a design as designs can get, especially for the time it was introduced.Carl", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Old School Digicam", "Author": "DarwinEvolved", "ReviewID": "R3UTPCVN3MH0L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are someone who cut their teeth on film cameras and hate the layout, interface and operation of most modern digital cameras, this may be the camera for you. I bought a very lightly used Digilux 2 via Amazon for less than half of it's original selling price with the complete package right down to the box it came in.I love it.The attraction of this model is that someone coming from a conventional 35mm camera can pick it up, use it like whatever they previously used and it just works. All the digicam stuff is there, but it's out of the way and you can concentrate on what you really bought the camera for- photography.Yes, these days a 5 megapixel spec is not much to talk about, but for most people's needs it is more than adequate. The lens is marvelous and the camera feels solid- not like the drop it and trash it feel that permeates so many cameras these days. Don't abuse it, but it feels like it should wear well over time.This model is discontinued as is the Lumix (Panasonic) twin of this model and has been replaced by the Digilux 3 in the Leica line. As the market for this kind of camera is small, we may never see anything like it again. It's a wonderful camera taken for what it is and could well become a collector's item down the line.If you can find one in decent condition for a reasonable price buy it. My best guess is that the resale price of these cameras has bottomed out and will probably appreciate over time.**UPDATE**In the 2 years since I wrote this review, the average price on Amazon and eBay has increased significantly.

Since I strongly believe in the Digital Age, I thought this is my opportunity to have the future of Leica.I had an enormous disappointment with the camera and the quality of the pictures. I made an extensive research online and found many positive things and ratings, so I bought it. Maybe this camera had something wrong in it. I compared the same picture moment and conditions with pictures of a canon S50 and believe it or not... the canon pictures were much more impressive.The worst I found in this camera was the digital viewfinder. I could never get a good focus with this technology... too complicated! You need to view a small box inside the vewfinder that changes so you can focus. This is a camera for a foto artist, this camera is for manual focusing and usage... believe me, you dont want to focus with a digital viewfinder... it is a terrible idea. At least not with this technology. There is not a better technology to focus than \"what you see is what you get\"!So until LEICA understands more about digital photography I will have to wait. I changed the Digilux 2 with a Canon 20d. Now... that is a GREAT camera. Dont waste your money in a brand that is just entering the digital age. They have allot to learn.
