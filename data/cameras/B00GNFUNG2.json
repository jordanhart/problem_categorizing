We specifically chose a bundle from Focus Camera through Amazon based on those reviews. We are very pleased with our purchase. The shipping took a little longer than expected, but we received it on Christmas Eve (ordered on Dec 18th), so just in time.In hindsight, we probably would pick a different bundle that included the extra battery. The bundle items are very good and the small soft case is perfect. We thought we wanted the hard case in addition to the soft, but not really, and that is the only reason we would chose a different bundle. You cannot go wrong with this camera, Focus Camera and their bundle choices.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Smart camera", "Author": "Tash Tashima", "ReviewID": "R26527XJVA4XFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is smarter than me.
