THE CAMERA WAS PLACED UNDER THE EVE IN THE BACK CORNER OF MY HOME. THE RAIN DID NOT CAUSE ME ANY PROBLEMS.  THE CAMERA HAD A ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF COLOR FOR THE PRICE I PAID. THE COVERAGE IS VERY GOOD, ALMOST WIDE ANGLE COVERAGE.  THE NIGHT COVERAGE IS ALSO ACCEPTABLE IF YOU HAVE MOTION DECTION DEVICES THAT WILL GO OFF AND PROVIDE SOME ILLUMINATION.  THE CAMERA HAS APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF RANGE IN TOTAL DARKNESS WHICH YOU CAN BARLEY MAKE OUT AN OBJECT.YOU CAN BUY ALL THE CONNECTORS AT RADIO SHACK TO HOOK UP THE CAMERA TO JUST ABOUT ANY DEVICE.

It sees very well in the dark...probably about 10 to 20 feet on a pitch black night, and much farther when the moonlight hits the snow.  WAY better than one of those X10 toys.  The color isn't real vibrant during the day (it's black and white at night), but it is definately color and it's a clear picture.  It may just be that I need to adjust my video adapter to improve the color.I needed it to connect to an RCA video jack, but the connector was the wrong type.  It is an RCA type of signal though so I was able to fudge something together to make it work without too much hassle.  Would have been nice if it came with an adapter though. If it had, I may have given it 5 stars.  Since I got it going, I've been very pleased with it.If you would like some great software to make good use of this camera, check out [...]  You can create macros to take snapshot automatically, view them remotely, control your lights, and much more.  You'll need a video adapter of some sort to plug the camera into.  I use the MSI VOX (it even has a TV tuner built in).Harry StrandStrandControl, LLC[...]hstrand@homedomination.com", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very solid camera", "Author": "D. Davis", "ReviewID": "R25KOC2J8ECU3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this to cover some blind spots around the front and side of our house. Color is real good and grandularity during the day is more than fine. During darkness, the night vision will only reachout about 15-20 ft. in total darkness. Like another reviewer mentioned, a light further out will help cover any weakness this may present. It seems to work well with the PC-4 card. You'll need a BNC cable connector as both ends are female. Having the 60 ft. of extra length is really nice and what seperates it from the other similar cameras in this class. Those only have a few feet which is why they are cheaper. You'll pay about the same with the extension cable that you may need to purchase with it.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Price, Fair Product", "Author": "W.

The wire from the camera terminates with a BNC connector but this cam will work with a standard TV. I suggest going to Radio Shack and get a  BNC Female to Phono Plug Adapter(Model: 278-250  |  Catalog #: 278-250) along with a short cable with RCA male at one end and RCA female at the other end and you are good to go (Radio Shack also has this in a short length).Ok, you have two of these great cam's and one TV, what are you going to do?  I found a cheap way to automatically switch between up to 4 cams with the output of the switcher going to one TV.  I found a Philips Automatic Video Selector and RF Modulator (MPN: PH61153) at WalMart (its not on their website you will have to go to the store) that, when set up correctly, will allow you to plug in up to four cam's and automatically cycle thru each input/cam every 5+ seconds (scan speed is adjustable).  The PH61153 will skip any input that does not have something plugged into it so I can use it with just my two cams for now.  The PH61153 was intended to automatically switch between video componets (DVD, VCR, DVR, etc) but for $24ish you can't go wrong.  BTW: I have a second PH61153 and use it for its intended purpose of automatically switching between video componets.You can't go wrong with this camera! I already have two and plan to get two more soon.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Recommended", "Author": "The Dude", "ReviewID": "R2ZXH3WDSBPJY6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To me, it's all about support after the sale.
