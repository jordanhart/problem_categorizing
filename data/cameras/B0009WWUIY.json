Chigama", "ReviewID": "R1Q2WL2BGHWTDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in June as a step up from my canon powershot A40. I had pentax lenses which helped make my decision. I was also reviewing the Canon Rebel line. I am happy with my choice. The range of options: all manual to programs and variations in between. I also wanted multiple shots per second and it's quite fast. Some of the controls are a bit awkward in some of the programs e.g. hold down button x while adjusting shutter or aperture with button y. But my hands are small so I'm adjusting to it. Overall, I'd buy it again.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good Body", "Author": "C. Hall", "ReviewID": "R1TFFDCWLOX6QC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This body was my first foray into the DSLR world.  In fact I had on held an SLR less than half a dozen times.  I was using a Casio EX-Z50, and getting annoyed with the lack of aperture and shutter controls. So, on a non-art major, college student budget I looked for a camera I could learn and develop with.I quickly found my way to DPReview where I spent many hours deciding what I needed and what I could afford.  This camera fit the bill.  I picked it up for 475 with the kit lens with one of the Pentax rebates + 50$ for a filter set, etc.Build quality is great, at first I treated the camera very delicately, wrapping it in a T-shirt anytime I traveled.  Now, I throw it in the back seat of my car, and dig it out when I get where I'm going without much worry of it being damaged.  The camera is sturdy and of average weight to comparable bodies from Cannon and Nikon.Controls are great, I love the Tv and Av modes.  The buttons seem to be in good locations though I don't do much action photography nor do I often worry about how long shots take, so maybe for an advanced shooter there might be a lack of buttons.Menus are easy with loads of options that will do most anything you ask of it.Image quality is pretty good.  Don't let the 6.1MP sensor bother you, its not about the MP at all it's about what that camera can do with the sensor.  Noise is pretty good, but your going to want a fast lens for low light, or a standalone flash because the on-board is largely useless, as most are.I just rolled over the counter 11k shots in 18 months and going strong.As with any Pentax body, the use of K mount lenses is easy and awesome, though there are quirks with Av and Tv, depending on the exact lens.  Also check out the screw mount adapter for even more compatibility, but be sure to get Pentax OEM, not EbayThings I don't love.-My USB port does not work, it did, now it doesn't.  But in Pentax's defense I never tried to fix it.-Dust is a problem so be careful as it is annoying to clean-Battery life varies greatly with temperature, so make sure you have good batteries, especially with those night-time long exposure shots-FPS is kiiinda low, but for a budget body theres not much you can do.-RAW + Jpeg would have been nice-Has been superseded by K100d and soon to be K200d?  But honestly if you can get a DL for less than either of those you'll be fine unless you need SR.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera but....", "Author": "Cindy \"Innsbrooker\"", "ReviewID": "R3DW6J39JXJGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pentax gives you quite a punch to capture images. I have owned my camera for three years and find it to be very flexible.  It adapts to its surroundings and gives countless options for those who want to manually adjust.  I would have rated 5 stars except for the fact that it collects dust which is typically of most of the early DSLRs.  In order to remove the dust, you have to spend lots of time with Photoshop OR pay $120 buck to have an expert blow out the dust.  This is a great camera but you need to be very careful when you change lens to prevent dust from collecting inside.", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "My favorite camera", "Author": "Michael Blackstock \"Michael772\"", "ReviewID": "R3CQ9LXLHWECN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my istDL back in 2006 and have never looked back. This camera is a workhorse, and believe me I have put it through quite a bit of abuse. I noticed right away how nice the color saturation was. My first trip with the camera was leaf peeping in New Hampshire and the colors blew me away! I have stood in the ocean taking pictures of friends surfing, and been under waterfalls with this camera and it stills keeps chugging along.
