{"Reviews": [{"Title": "VERY FUNDAMENTAL INTRODUCTION", "Author": "DJJ", "ReviewID": "R1IND8O92VU591", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very fundamental review on the D700. It's basically an introduction to photography on some level. When it finally gets into explaining the camera's features, it just names them and goes way too fast. I did not really find this product all that helpful.Lucky for me, I had the foresight to also purchase the Volume 2 Advanced Tips DVD.This is far more helpful in  explaining what you can actually do with this camera.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "D700 Training Video", "Author": "Donald L. Smith", "ReviewID": "R37YB5PJVRMRDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "JumpStart Video Training Guide for the Nikon D700 Digital SLR Camera on DVD (2 Disc Set)This training video got into just about everything the camera has to offer.  It covers all of the settings and is a good starting point rather than using the manual which is huge.  The only negative I found was that it moved very quickly.  But that's why they put the pause button in there.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "No luck running the CD's on G5 Power Mac or MacBook Pro!", "Author": "Michael J. Shannon", "ReviewID": "RJQR9YU5ILWQV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Upon receiving the product (from 47th Street Photo), I noted the plastic wrap appeared to have been a re-wrap of the CD case.  My first try running CD #1 on my MacBook Pro resulted in about 5 minutesof satisfactory operation, then it froze.  I next switched the CD to my G5 Power Mac (both Apples have maxed-out memory upgrades) and on that, it ran about 8 minutes before freezing.  Severalattempts with same result.  Since I can't seem to get it to run reliably, its impossible to give it any kind of an evaluation.  At the price I paid for it, I don't think it's worth my time to bother contacting47th Street Photo about it; I just think the recording technology used by the CD's creator is abysmal, or the CD media quality is lacking.Possibly this evaluation will result in someone at either Amazon or 47th Street Photo doing something beneficial for me.  I just don't like the hassle.  My advice?  Buyer beware of this product!", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "JumpStart Video Training Guide for the Nikon D700 Digital SLR Camera on DVD (2 Disc Set)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31xUkdwhD0L.jpg", "ProductID": "B001GDL7AW"}}
