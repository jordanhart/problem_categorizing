{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, with one major flaw....", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RIZGFA5XCPVZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My needs in a digital camera were simple, or so I thought. I take a lot of photos, 10-15 or more rolls at a time, which can get very expensive when you take into account the cost of film, developing and printing. It is also  time consuming, as I scan the best ones and print them out as 8 x 10s. Not  to mention a pain, carrying lots of film, lenses, filters, etc. around with  me. My aim was to save money and time, but I didn't want to sacrifice  quality, either.The Nikon Coolpix 990 takes excellent photos, and 8x10s  print very nicely. I added a $400 flash card and that has plenty of room  for lots of pictures (about 80 at fine quality), as poor shots can be  deleted immediately. Downloading the pictures to my laptop is a breeze with  the included usb cable (another review said that cut and paste doesn't  work, but it works fine for me). It's rather heavy on batteries, but once I  switched to rechargeable AAs there was a big improvement. One plus digital  cameras have over film is being able to adapt to current lighting  conditions - no fiddling with filters if taking photos indoors without a  flash, for example. So far, I was very pleased.The major flaw, for me,  came when I used the optional 2X lens (bought at the same time as the  camera). Nowhere in the literature I read before I bought the camera did it  mention that attaching the lens disables the flash. You can't even use an  external flash with it. I take many shots in poor light and at a distance,  and this renders the camera unusable in those circumstances as I am often  also unable to use a tripod. I was more than a little annoyed to find that  after spending close to $2000 total, I still had to take my 35mm camera  with me. I don't know if this is peculiar to the Nikon or common among  digital cameras, but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.Despite this, I  am pleased with the camera, and would recommend it, especially if most of  your photos are taken outdoors or in bright indoor lighting. On my last  trip I shot only two rolls of 35mm film. At this rate the camera will have  paid for itself within the year in film and film developing savings, and  it's worth its weight in gold for the time I save on scanning and  retouching photos.", "Date": "June 3, 2000"}, {"Title": "My unbiased opinion on this camera", "Author": "Bobbity", "ReviewID": "R1RIW454S3GQWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me say that this camera is incredible, and worth every penny.  I've owned mine for about a week, and I've taken some incredible photos that look like they came out of a magazine (and I'm an amateur at best).Now, let's get realistic about the camera.  I want to provide enough factual information to allow people to make their decisions about whether or not this is the right camera for them.  TheCoolpix 990 has tons of great points.  Most notably, it's 3.34 megapixels (3.24 effective), and thus produces top-quality images with incredible sharpness.  Another thing that was had me sold was the fact that you can go into full manual mode with this camera.  You can choose either shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual (including fully manual focus).  This aspect of the camera should appeal to the professional or \"artsy\" photographer who wishes to customize the camera to get the exact effect they want.After you upgrade the firmware to v1.1, the speed of certain camera operations are a bit faster, but the camera is already originally very fast.  Reviewing photographs in \"Play\" mode is a breeze, and there's not much delay when paging through them.Buy rechargeable NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries and a charger before your camera ships.  The alkaline batteries that ship with the camera will die within hours,guaranteed.  Also, grab the amazing Maha C204F charger.  It allows you to leave the charger plugged in with batteries in it indefinitely, without ruining the batteries at all.  The charger will save you several hundred dollars in batteries.A few drawbacks about the 990 (yes, they do exist): BSS (best shot selection) feature is kind of weak.  It's supposed to let you take 10 shots and it chooses the best (\"the one with the most detail\" I believe the manual says, whatever that means).  On some occasions it has actually chosen blurry photos over the sharp ones.  I've no clue how this works, but Nikon needs to reevaluate this function.  And a warning: don't rely on this camera for good long-exposure shots.  Shutter times of 4 seconds and longer in a dark setting will sometimes show a lot of noise in the photograph.  This is a very noisy camera (audibly and graphically), so try to limit your exposure times.  Also, please note that you will NOT be able to access the \"info.txt\" file that people in other reviews have mentioned.  Yes, the camera saves all photo details (shutter speed, ISO, flash, aperture, etc.) to a file called \"info.txt\", but you CANNOT access the file unless you're using a card reader.  The NikonView software will only let you pull photos from the camera, nothing else.I'll conclude this here because I could rant on for a while on other great points.  The camera is truly amazing, buy it now.  Yes, it has drawbacks, but no camera is perfect--and this one comes pretty close to perfection.  This camera is comparable to the Olympus C3030, so check that out as well.  The features of the C3030 are similar, and in some ways the camera is a little better (the movie mode actually records audio!), and a little worse (uses SmartMedia only).", "Date": "October 24, 2000"}, {"Title": "Read before you buy.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RUHU5LHWPF0AR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a review for users of 35mm cameras who are thinking of moving over to their first digital camera.  (Gadget junkies can safely ignore this post.)Let me start by saying that this is a great camera.  For my  purposes the 3M pixel resolution is as good as film.  But if you are just  moving over from a 35mm for the first time you are in a for a few rude  surprises.  Some which are endemic to all digital cameras, some Nikon 990  flaws.1. The built in flash is worse than useless for indoor portraits.  The redeye problem is horrendous and unsolvable with the built-in flash.  You'll find yourself buying an external flash (~$150)and bracket (~$50).  Why they didn't put a hotshoe on the camera is beyond me.2. If you  bought the camera for it's 3m pixel resolution you will find the 16M card  supplied as useful as a 16M Windows machine.  You need at least one 128M  card (~$250) which holds ~80 pictures (unless you plan to tether yourself  to a computer.)3. The LCD display and autofocus eat Alkaline batteries  for lunch.  You'll go through a set every 1.5 hours. At minimum you need  rechargable NiCad's.  If you're going to be outdoors for awhile consider a  rechargable external Nicad pack (~$50)4. Shutter lag time seem a lot  longer (worse) than 35mm cameras. About 1 1/2 seconds from when you push  the shutter to when the camera goes \"click\" in auto mode.  Ouch.5. If you are used to \"motor drive\" on your 35mm this  camera will drive you crazy.  There is a 1.5 second delay between photos  for the first two photos and 7 (yes seven!) seconds for the following one.  You simply cannot shoot a series of \"action\" pictures at high  res.6. Oh, hope you didn't expect a carrying case when you bought your  camera.  It's ok because once you buy the external flash and bracket you  need a larger one anyway.7. Getting pictures into your PC via the  compact flash cards are a no brainer if you have either a) USB or b) PCMCIA  adapter for a portable.  In either case you need an compact flash adapter  (~$50 for the PC ~$10 for a portable computer).  Of course you can connect  your camera directly to the computer, but trust me, get an adapter. Make  sure your USB port works before buying the camera.8. Hope you bought an  Epson 1270 or a printer with equivalent quality (~$450)to print your  photos.  If not, get a cheaper (less resolution) camera.9. Get familar  with Shutterfly.com to send photos to your relatives.Summary: Great  camera.  If you're happy taking pictures of the family on a 35mm the  resolution of this camera won't disappoint or embarass you.  However, the  amount of work and manual reading may.  Plan on spending another $500+ for  peripherals.  Learn battery management skills.  Learn how to make every  shot count.", "Date": "June 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "Follow-up, 5 weeks later..", "Author": "CJinJax \"CJ\"", "ReviewID": "R38D7QRLZH3Q10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera now for 5 weeks and like it even better than when I first got it. In my first review (here)I sent my camera out for service, well it only took 8 days from out the door to back in. Nikon service is great and you can track progress along the way via an 800 #.  All the review treads here are pretty accurate for this camera, so I'll keep this basic. The Coolpix 990 is an awesome machine. The pictures are beautiful!  The camera has a swivel joint that allows you to point the lens assembly in one direction and swivel the LCD so you can see it, allowing for holding the camera overhead and focusing in on your subject over crowds. It allows for very creative pictures. I bought extra memory cards and 4 sets of rechargeable nimh batteries that last forever. I get 120+- pics per set of nimh vs 60+- with regular alkali bats, and all I have to do is recharge them to go again, BIG savings.. There are tons of add-on accys. for this camera; zoom lens, filters, external flashes, panorama brackets, you name it. I'm adding lenses and flashes myself. There is a photo book written for the 990 that details the manual settings, with examples, that allows you to take abvantage of the powerful control options built in to this camera.  Your possibilities are enormus. Or you can switch into Auto mode and, point & shoot. There are BB forums dedicated to this camera that have lots information for accy. combos, shooting advice, or knowledge sharing. Before I bought this, I read all the reviews and visited camera stores to physically check all the options available. The 990 has a great feel to it; very solid, an easy menu to navigate, and the control buttons are laid out for a comfortable, quality, feel. Competing cameras are too small for my hands and/or don't take as good a picture. I download my digital pics to on-line developers who mail photo prints back to me. No more bad pictires, and you can't tell the difference between digital vs 35mm film. However, i find that printing the photos on my printer with good paper yields photos that (when framed) rival photo finishing from a developer. This technology is truly amazing. I now find mysely going on lots of picture taking hikes experimenting with the different settings on the camera. I can see the results immediatly in the LCD, learn from my mistakes, delete the bad, make adjustments, and take more good pics -vs- taking a roll of film, getting it developed, spending lots of $ for film and processing, forgetting what settings I did in the first place, and having lots of bad pics. THe savings will pay for the camera and accessories! Oh, and in the 5 weeks I had this camera, I took almost 2000 pictures. Do the math and save the money! (2000 pics / 24 pics per roll = 83 rolls. $15 (film & developing costs) per roll and I would of spent $1,250. and had lots of bad pics to boot over the last 5 weeks. This is Really cool stuff. I don't know what else to say, Great camera, great support from Nikon, and endless resources to improve on your camera skills. You'll never be sorry you got this camera. Once you step into the digital world, you'll never go back to film.

Buchan", "ReviewID": "R20UVXP76IJ460", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my 990 about 2 weeks ago, and I take it everywhere with me.  I share the view of many of the reviewers -- you NEED rechargable NiMh batteries (in the first 3 days I went through 3 sets of alkelines) and a bigger memory card (one reviewer says that you can take only 10 pictures at the best quality on the enclosed 16 Mb card -- in fact, ONE picture at the top quality takes about 9 Mb, so you have to download one before you can get another on.)  These petty complaints notwithstanding, the quality of this camera and the control you get are remarkable.  One excellent aspect of the camera is that it's a wonderful camera to learn photographic technique on.  Every photo taken generates a 5 page data file that records the settings of the camera.  Take 4 pictures of a subject at different settings and you can instantly check to see which is the best, and then check what settings you were using -- f. 4.0 at 1/60th of a second, using spot metering, etc.  If I wanted to do this comparison on my 35 mm I would have to take notes of every setting, then shoot a whole roll of film and have it developed, before I could view the pictures side-by-side.  Now I can take pictures and immediately compare them.", "Date": "October 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "From a 35mm perspective", "Author": "David Wihowski", "ReviewID": "R3R94A29U2HKA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used 35mm SLR cameras for over 20 years.  I was hesitant to delve into the digital realm.  Here are the pros and cons of this camera with respect to 35mm SLRs.Pros: No film to deal with.  You can view the results of your photos immediately.  This is great for playing with framing or bracketing (over/underexposing), or other creative things: you can delete the shots that just did not work.  The others you can save for printing or for use on the computer.  This feature is great for any picture you take.  You can see how it turned out.  You will know if so-and-so had their eyes closed or if things were moving too fast for the shutter speed.  I can not stress how convenient this is.  You can delete and then retake bad shots!The lens on this camera tilts every which way.  I use a tripod frequently: I do not have to adjust the tilt angle of the tripod with this camera--I just tilt the camera lens.  The LCD display frees your eye from being stuck to the viewfinder.  This is incredibly convenient.  You can hold the camera at arms-length and still see what's in the viewfinder.Compact size.  The Coolpix is smaller than most SLRs and the memory cards are so much smaller than film.Ability to control \"white balance\".  No more yellow indoor shots.  Cons:  Lack of lens flexibility.  With a SLR you click-and-twist one lens off and click-and-twist a different one on, period.  You have limited screw-on choices with this camera.  Also you have to change the camera's computer settings to use these lenses.  It takes about 30 seconds (or more if you have to drag out the manual) to make a lens change with the Coolpix.  Aperatures are more limited on this camera.  This is especially troublesome for portraits or other photos where a very wide aperature/shallow depth-of-field is often desirable.Color print quality is subject to the quality of your PC printer.  And yes, you can have professional printing done--it's just an extra hassle.  If you have a poor quality printer you may need to buy a NEW printer to get the results you want.I don't know how to explain it, but Coolpix digital pictures are just not the same as film pictures.  Some aspects are better, some seem worse.Battery issues and other issues as mentioned by other reviewers.Conclusion:I WILL NOT get rid of my 35mm SLRs--they cannot be completely replaced by the Coolpix for all situations. I WILL use my Coolpix 990 for many, many snapshots and many kinds of \"creative\" pictures, as well.", "Date": "October 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "NIKON's CoolPix 990 is VERY-VERY Cool.  More than Cool!", "Author": "James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"", "ReviewID": "RXEBR2DMZ0I3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a semi-professional commercial photographer, I know what quality is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line for starters, the Nikon-990 makes great  color shots with very (not so suprising) High-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos; as a very picky guy, NIKON is telling the  truth. The 5x7 prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. Since not  many prints are not made larger than 5x7, the superlative colors in this  print size will likely give the Film Camera buffs a challange. This camera  is easy to use & small, however has an exhaustive number of features.  My wife and our 13 year old, carry it on all vacation locations; And when I  don't want to carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly  shocked at the excellent picture quality of the NIKON 990 which also  includes great software, so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily  connect to the yellow video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show  of the days activities. I would recommend purchasing two (2) 80MB memory  card with the camera purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture  opportunities (an 80MB card has room for 50 shots per card at max its  resolution) without having to worry about running out of memory. So for a  day's shooting two 80MB cards will give the equivalent of four (25-shot)  rolls of film.  Since you can erase shots that you don't like, take MANY,  MANY shots and then pick the best ones you like to save, and for printing  or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the evening, I can  copy the photo-files to the lap-top's hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, so there's room for another 50 photos available in preparation  for the next days photo activities. NIKON provides serial, USB cables, and  software to accomplish this simply. Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera  with less than 2,000,000 pixels. (The older models, presently having good  sale prices, are technology of 3 years ago, and you'll wish you spent the  extra money for a higher resolution camera). Since NIKON has been the  camera business for many, many years, its no surprise that they have  created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip) with EXCELLENT Color quality  and detail. This is must have, you'll not be dissappointed. If you're on a  tighter budget check out the KODAK-280 at less than $500 which takes  excellent photos for a 2,000,000 pixel camera. If you have another few  hundred dollars, check out the SONY or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers,  which produce actual photo quality continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes;  These printers are not dot-matrix's with all the little dots. The camera  and the printer makes for a great combo family gift for under $1,500, that  anyone in the family can use without having to even turn on a computer, as  the printer prints directly off the camera memory card. Don't make yourself  craze, since DIGITAL Cameras are slightly different than a typical film  point-and-shoot cameras, be sure to read the instruciton booklet, before  pushing all the buttons. The documentation NIKON provides is very easy to  understand. So take it slow when you open the Box for the first time. It's  intuitive to use, after the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going  back to the booklets. My wife and 13 year old son love this camera (as do  I)and they have no trouble dealing with the camera's features, which are  exhaustive.  This 3.340,000 pixel camera is one of the best I've tested  yet. ONE more point, the camera can twist at its middle (permitting the  lens to point up or down, with the LCD Pannel staying directly in-line with  your eyes) which is an amazing engineering idea which gives the  photographer a whole new perspective for taking pictures without having to  have the camera pressed against your face. The LCD screen is bright even  out doors.  JLW/2000/08/25.", "Date": "August 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great camera with some flaws", "Author": "George P.

About 4-5 months ago I gave my Nikon 950 to my better half itching to jump on the 3.3 Mp bandwagon. Right off the bat there were only 2 cameras to consider (the Sony DSC-S70 and the Nikon 990), all other 3.3's were just not up to par with these two. After a month of research I decided that the S70 would be the better of the 2 because of the sleek point and click design and sony's proprietary memory stick. Both camera's are true 3 megapixel cameras unlike the predecessor DSC-505V, both cameras have viewfinders (a must-have for day photography), and both cameras deliver exceptional pictures. But with the far stylish look of the S70 at $200 less the S70 was my choice at the time. I then spent the next 2 months trying to locate the camera in stock and at a good price, fortunately Amazon began to sell DCs which allowed me to start pricing cameras again. However, the Sonys were all backordered, which ended up to be a blessing in disguise. A few weeks later a relative purchased the 990 and allowed me to tinker with it. Still a believer on the S70 I was reluctant in accepting the bulkier design of the camera, but after a few hours I found the 990 to be the true champ of the 3.3's. During my tinkering I found a couple facts to consider for both cameras: 1. Both cameras come with an inadequate amount of storage, so getting extra memory is a MUST. 2. 1 battery (or 4 for the Nikon) will not do the job while you are on a trip. 3. Zoom on both are extremely low, so they will never truly replace a 35mm. Taking those into consideration along with the offer Amazon had on the 990, it was hands down the better of the two for these reasons: 1. The 990 uses CF cards which are a standard in several cameras unlike the proprietary Memory Stick, also you get 16mb with the 990 compared to the 8mb with the S70. 2. A 64mb stick costs as much as a 96mb CF card. 3. The S70's memory write times were significantly slower than the 990 (due to the memory stick again). 4. The 990 uses AA batts which can be found anywhere. 5. The Manual Options for the 990 gives the photographer so much control over their photo conditions. 6. The 990s swivel design is fabulous, something totally impossible on the S70 unless your workaround happens to be your \"swivel-neck\". Now does this make the 990 a great point&click? Probably not (dont get me wrong, the 990 is an unbelievable on its \"Auto\" mode) you will thoroughly enjoy the camera more because of the configurable nature of the camera, if you plan to truly take digital photography seriously then this is your camera. Also, a few quirks you need to adjust to with the camera (all DCs have them, but these I found were actually minor since you can find workarounds for them): 1. Batteries, the 990 inhales them... get a set of at least 4 to a recommended 8 rechargables, they cost a lot, but you will need them, the NiMH rechargers work great. 2. Get at least 32-64mb of memory, 16mb = 1 picture at the 990's absolute highest setting. 3. Upgrade the firmware to 1.1 when you get the chance, the autofocus upgrade is noticable.. quite noticable. 4. The software with the camera is weak, very weak (basic app to download pictures), get a picture editing package. 5. Built-in flash not the best for distant shots, which can be compensated with an external flash. 6. Red-eye is there and red-eye suppression doesn't do the trick most of the time, but get a red-eye removing pen at your local camera shop, they work wonders. Like I said, every camera has quirks, but if I listed the quirks I discovered about the S70, I would never end this review. Finally, I assume that you can guess which camera I finally purchased off Amazon. I've been messing with it for this past week and I am now a Nikon believer (was one with the 950, but more so with this camera). I'm so eager to take pictures with it these holidays and hope that if you purchased the 990, that you find what I wrote true to your experiences as well. To those who are considering, I hope you find what I wrote informational. Merry Christmas everyone!! :)", "Date": "December 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "I really like this camera, good choice for ambitious amateur", "Author": "J. G. Heiser", "ReviewID": "RHPM27504TOKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.  All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution & quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely. The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.  It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Z\u00fcrich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.  I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low....  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.

This is my third Coolpix Digital Camera. (Coolpix 900 and Coolpix 950.) Each generation has been a significant improvement over the previous generation, and, from my perspective, well worth the upgrade. I agree with much of the other reviewers comments:1. Definitely purchase NIMH rechargeable batteries. They last much longer than anything else. I keep 3 extra sets with my camera at all times.2. It was necessary for me to not only have a larger CompactFlash Card (64MB and 96MB) but to have two or three extras. It is an issue like carrying a couple of extra rolls of film. However, since the CompactFlash Cards are almost infinitely reusable, the more pictures you take, the quicker you recover your costs.3. Whereas the 990 takes great pictures by itself, you can improve them significantly by using a photo editing program such as Photoshop. I have found this to be true for both print film and slides. You get a much better picture when scanned and edited in your computer.4. If the quality of the final prints is important, some form of dye sublimation printing process is essential to avoid the pixelation inherent in (particularly older) inkjet technology. Epson's Photo printers seem to have solved the problem, but I prefer the dry media printers. I use an Alps MD 5000, which unfortunately is no longer available in the USA.When it comes to the drawbacks noted by several of the other reviewers, I believe familiarity with the camera and the digital system of photography will alleviate most of them. One of the reviewers seemed to have had a defective product, rather than anything inherently wrong with the 990.The only real complaint I have about the 990 (and I believe it is a problem with any digital camera that depends on an LCD view screen) is that it is very difficult to see the images in bright sunlight. I think Nikon should design a hood to shade the screen. I have done makeshift things without great success.Overall, I am well pleased with my 990.

This camera is for a true  enthusiast, a person testing high end consumer digital cameras before  buying the professional line for business, or for I guess, a person who  just has the bucks to have the latest.2.  I love it since I am  constantly imaging events or children and need to have a camera that is  fast (does not take for ever for it to focus and capture the image from the  time you click the camera to the time it captures the image to put on disk.  It records to disk (memory/digital film - whatever you want to call it),  It needs to have capacity for high storage, fast downloads.3.  The  camera itself in comparison to other cameras of this style and caliber is  quite easy to use.  (The swivel feature is really nice to get those angles  that are harder to get)4. Minimal weight and size for its features.  Nice.5.  Getting the images to computer uses the drag and drop concept  of windows.  Since at the point of arrival, this camera did not have its  software ready to make upload easy like most cameras have.  Per the note  packaged in the camera, it will not be available for Win 98 users till June  2000ish.The drag and drop is not intuitive.  You should have reasonable  windows knowlege to figure out that you need to open both the Nikon viewer  and a window set on the location of where you want to put the images.  DRAG  and DROP.  Copy and paste does NOT work.But once you get the idea using  the camera with USB cable is so fast in comparison to that of serial....  this flies. 6.

Though I had them on speaker  phone, was able to have dinner and dress the kids for bed, it was  annoying.7.  So, since Nikon service is rather poor (unless you are  talking about the sales dept), I reccomend that if you buy this camera, and  are spending this kind of money on a camera, you need to have: good  digital camera knowlege/experience, very good windows and windows imaging  knowlege, wants to be able to have high quality prints made when that  \"oh so special\" image is actually captured to disk and a really  trustworthy dealer.", "Date": "May 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix 990: Sophisticated Digital Point & Shoot", "Author": "Gary W.

When digital point & shoot cameras exceeded three megapixels, I learned I could get sharp 8x10 prints on my inkjet printer that came close to the quality of 35mm 8x10's.  The Coolpix 990 has many of the same features as its 35mm counterparts.  For example, it has similar metering patterns: matrix, center-weighted, and spot.  It also has selectable focusing and spot metering areas, just like the F5 and F100 35mm cameras.  It also has flash compensation, exposure compensation, fill flash, red-eye reduction, and slow sync flash, just like the 35mm \"big boys\".  If all this sounds complicated, trust your instincts.  This is a camera aimed at experienced photographers, or those who are interested in a fully adjustable point and shoot digital camera with all the bells and whistles.  A nice feature of this camera is that it also has an \"automatic\" mode, which makes most of the decisions for you.  That mode yields acceptable results, and is a nice way to get used to the camera.  I would recommend this camera to someone who is very interested in top quality digital photography.  With the automatic mode, even the more timid or inexperienced members of the family can use it and get good results.

This is a wonderful camera in every fashion!  It's made in true Nikon tradition--durable, dependable, and simple to use.  Does it do what my D1 will do--no it won't, but it wasn't intended to.  However, it does share many similar functions to the D1 or a well-equiped SLR.  You have the option of aperture or shutter speed priority, program (and program shift), as well as full manual control.  And if you use the LCD panel for viewing, you do have a digital SLR of sorts, so you can use filters (such as a polarizer) and others.  So you do have a very capable and creative tool with this camera.  My main purpose for buying this camera was to have a digital \"point-and -shoot\" that wasn't as cumbersome as the D1 or an SLR and didn't require carrying around an array of lenses but still gave me some of the SLR tools that would be useful.  In other words, this camera allows me to do digital imaging and keep it simple.My only bone of contention with the 990 is the flash.  Expect to remove red-eye from 90 percent of your people-pictures.  And the red-eye reduction feature doesn't help much.  The flash is just too close to the lens--period!  I bought the flash bracket so I can use my Nikon SB-28 flash and that proved to be a flawless combination.  The only problem with that arrangement is that it sort of defeats the point-and-shoot purpose to a small extent.  The only other issue would be seeing the LCD panel in bright light outdoors, but I imagine that's probably a typical problem with most of these cameras.  But here's a little tip.  Take a piece of black posterboard, fashion it into a square tube the size of the LCD panel, put some narrow strips of velcro on it and around the LCD panel and voila--a viewing hood that works like a charm!  Also, as is probably also typical for these cameras, don't expect long battery life if you use the LCD panel all the time.  Get some rechargeable metal hydroxide batteries.  The life span is far, far longer.  The Everyready system works very well.  Aside from that, for general shooting outdoors and indoors, I love this camera.  I have to be honest and state that I didn't do a lot of comparing.  I had (and still have) the Coolpix 800 and loved it as well, and again, being a Nikon freak, there wasn't any indecision here.  I simply wanted a \"point-and-shoot\" digital that had more capabilities than the 800 had.

The resolution of pictures taken with a Nikon Coolpix 990 is indeed extremely high.  This camera has three \"resolution levels.\"  I usually use the middle level: the \"Normal\" mode.  The resolution of pictures taken in this mode is very, very good.  I would not hesitate to make 8\" by 6\" prints of such pictures.  Rarely do I use the \"Fine\" mode (there is really no reason to use it in my view). In the \"Normal\" mode, I believe that I get about 20-25 pictures on my memory card.  For my purposes that is adequate. Of course, my initial approach has proven too simplistic:  there are other factors (other than resolution alone) that you should consider before buying a digital camera! If are thinking of buying a digital camera to photograph subjects that move quickly and erratically (such as a young child), you will soon realize that taking digital pictures is not ideal.  While I understand that the Nikon is relatively quick compared to other digital cameras, it still takes a fraction of a second to actually \"take\" the picture after pressing the button.  So you end up with a lot failed pictures that would have been great if taken with a conventional camera.  The menu (for deleting pictures and other functions) is very intuitive and I believe it allows even those of us who don't read the owners manual cover-to-cover (like me) to get a lot out of the camera. I have one problem with the camera that is of a more serious nature:  often I take a picture that will cause the camera to \"crash\" when downloaded or viewed on the display (I often use the useful \"slide show\" feature).  It generates an error message and so far hasn't affected the other pictures on the memory card (but I have not been able to recover the subject picture).  I don't know if this is a problem with the memory card or with the camera - but it is annoying.  Without this problem, I would have given this camera a 5 star rating...

As an amateur photographer, I was looking for something reliable that produced excellent photographs. There were a plethora of websites containing opinions on which camera to purchase; I even took a few \u00a1\u00a7compatibility\u00a1\u00a8 tests, and most of the results named the Nikon Coolpix 990 as my best bet. After asking others for their opinions, I received an overwhelmingly positive response to this camera. There were  a few people who deemed the Coolpix 990 too pricey and convoluted, and I did consider getting some other less expensive cameras (like Fuji and Kodak), but my propensity for top-of-the-line items ultimately won. I purchased the 990 here on Amazon, and it arrived in a couple of days (thanks for the speedy service, Amazon!). There were several fears, however. A few people have said that such a high-end camera was not exactly necessary, that a cheaper camera would do the job. Initially, I had only planned to use this camera to post photos on websites, but I then realised that if I\u00a1\u00a6m going to spend a few hundred dollars on a big toy, I might as well have it do everything (namely 8 x 10 prints).Having just returned from a short vacation in London, England, I can now accurately attest to the 990\u00a1\u00a6s excellence. I took this camera everywhere, and I soon abandoned my camera bag and I hung it around my neck for easy access. The tube, Parliament, Tower Bridge, pubs, restaurants, streets, shopping centres....I went to many places and took several photographs along the way. Before this trip I had really only used this camera for a few photos around my town, but now that I\u00a1\u00a6d taken it on vacation, I have a more lucid perception. This camera is phenomenal, and although I cannot ramble on in technical terms, I can articulate the ease with which I took photos, the terrific quality of the prints, and the sheer professionalism of it. Some specific points:* The LCD is nicely-sized and clear, although I would stock up on NiHM batteries. I played around with the menu settings for such a few minutes, and the batteries completely drained. During my trip I shut off the screen to conserve the batteries. * The swivel lens is convenient and affords a lot of versatility. Some people consider it odd, but I thought it was a nice touch.* 16 MB memory card included in the box. Instead of buying more cards, however, I purchased the IOMEGA Pocketzip (formerly Clik! Drive) in order to dump my photos onto it during my trip. Highly recommended procedure!* Some red-eye when you use the flash, but I've stopped using it altogether, as I prefer the soft effect of photos without it. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with this marvelous camera.

In low light situations, you better be  on a tripod, and have a flashlight handy to let the camera get a focus  lock.

NiMHs are a must, I use 1600maH which usually lasts 12 hours at least. Get real nikon, ship at least nicads, sure its a cost issue, but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for 15 mins or less. (2) The manual is weak, but is typical of translated manuals. 3) accessories are hard to get hold of, and the remote release is expensive (although its feature loaded) an IR or RF based remote would be nice, most other camera makers offer them. (4) suffers from red eye a lot. (5) low quality software on the PC, even lower on the MAC, crashes often on win2k, even after the update to camera firmware and PC software, crashes on first time use everytime. (6) menu access is slow, camera could do with a faster cpu, latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better. (7) one very small thing that would only affect a few people, is the inbuilt IR filter for the lens, which means you can't do the near IR style photography thats popular with other digicams.other than those small quibbles, its generally an excellent camera, its a lot of fun to use.  Once you are setup with NiMHs and a decent sized CF card its easy sailing, we've had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it.

I specifically wanted full manual control and the ability to use an external flash (the internal flash is almost useless). The large handgrip is a welcomed change from most other digicams out there.  It feels nice and solid in your hand while the no-slip surface does its job admirably.  The shutter release button is solid and the mode jog dial is placed perfectly.  The user interface could benefit from minor usability improvements, but for the most part is easy to use and learn in seconds without consulting the manual.  And to echo what everyone else mentions, battery life lasts me about 40 shots with the monitor and flash turned off.  I take along a spare set of AA batteries for short outings.

For web content, picture quality is awesome, though.  Resolution and sharpness are perfectly acceptable for 4x6 prints.  Nice to have the 3:2 ratio to let you print uncropped 4x6 images.  Macro capabilities are great.Since I prefer to print my personal images, I feel the Coolpix's weakness is in its color reproduction.  Photos printed on a Fuji Frontier 370 system seem to lack a certain saturation or 'punch' in various colors - things seem to be on the dull or compressed side and not very vibrant, even if the original scene was.  This is especially noticeable when you hold a digital print next to a film print when both have used the same exposure and focal length and have been printed on the same machine.Sure, I can spend time in PhotoShop adjusting curves and levels, but that's more time consuming than it's worth if you ask me.  For a few photos, no big deal.  But if I just shot 50+ images that are keepers, I'm not going to spend countless hours tweaking each one.  I found that a semi-decent shortcut is to get the ICC profile for my target printer and batch up all the images in PhotoShop to have the profile applied automatically.  I then spend $0.29/print at my local camera shop getting them printed.

The optical zoom isn't that spectacular, either (only  3x).  Daylight pix are great though, sharp and clear, and there are none of  those JPEG \"artifacts\" you see from cheaper cameras.  I found  the Coolpix to be quite usable right out of the box.  It comes with 4 AA  batteries, which don't seem as short-lived as I'd been fearing. Then again,  I'm more used to the camcorder whose battery only lasted 15-20 minutes, so  the Coolpix seems far superior there already.  I did, nonetheless, order a  set of NiMH batteries + charger.  Save your money on the extras, though  - if you're only taking photos for the web, you probably don't need a  bigger compact flash card - the 16Mb card included with the camera will  hold 40 \"basic\" quality images, which are 2048x1536 pixels.

The large buffer means that there is no delay between pressing the shutter release and acquiring a picture. The colour reproduction is excellent and (importantly) very realistic. Battery consumption is also good when using Ni-metal hydride batteries.  I need a change of batteries every 10-14 days despite daily use (20-40 Mb of photographs at basic resolution) with the flash on for nearly all pictures.

Raising the ISO to anything over 100 will result in lots of ugly noise in the photo.  The built in flash is horrible.  It is good to use as a fill flash in outdoor shadows, but will give poor results as a stand alone flash indoors.  For good indoor shots, I have found the best results using a tripod and the \"slow sync\" flash mode. The shutter speed will be very slow, so any movement of the subject will result in blur.  Again, dim light is this camera's biggest fault.  It will ALWAYS set a SLOW shutter speed, making it impossible to hand hold the camera.  Manually setting a faster speed such as 1/30 will not work, because the camera cannot set a large enough f-stop to allow a proper exposure.  So, in the right conditions, the 990 can take perfect photos, but in night or indoor situations, you will have to really make some carefull settings and use a tripod to get good results.  The macro mode is FANTASTIC. It will take stunning close up shots. I really think that is this camera's greatest asset. The rotating head makes taking close ups in ackward positions a breeze.  Another couple negatives though, the monitor is impossible to see in bright sunlight, turn it off to save power and use the viewfinder.  This brings up the second negative, if you have an accessory lens attached to the head, it will block out your view through the viewfinder.

Outdoors, the very, very long cord of the battery pack is a nuisance, and the NiMH batteries seem to have lost rather a lot of their charge while just lying idle.  So I have two sets.  These batteries are not made by Nikon, of course. On the other hand, I don't know where to assign blame for the fact that the plugs between camera and battery cord and between cord and batteries tend to lose contact; I have to frequently twist then a bit to restore power, and of course the settings are lost and have to be re-made.

While it is not up to the resolution of 35 mm film, you can doa lot of useful photography with the new 3.3 meg pixel count. The gotcha is that it does not ship with a serial (com1/2) cable... So unless you have Win 98 or 2000 installed on a computer that has NEVER had Win 95 installed (? This is what the Nikon manual says) so you can use the USB cable. My recommendation is to buy a SanDisk ImageMate for parallel port (about $50), and some extra memory cards; then you'll never have to be concerned about the data transfer time or OS compatibility.
