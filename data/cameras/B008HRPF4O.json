The other accessories - filters, 2 batteries, 2 chargers etc. are what I chose for this package and I am not disappointed. Delivery was timely and surprised me as it got to me from my the Supplier via my Miami Sky-box, to Trinidad in exactly 9 days...with the delivery time they targeted for delivery to Miami spot-on time.My one disappointment is that the full-sized tripod is a sub-standard product that I will not use for my T4i nor my SONY Camcorder as it is most unstable. I have one of those already and I use it to mount a small LED light when shooting, so this one will also be thrown into light-mount service. I must now purchase a seriously sturdy tripod for my T4i as my other one I use for my Canon G9 camera and the SONY Camcorder.All in all I am quite pleased...it was a good purchase.Canon EOS Rebel T4i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm EF-S IS II Lens & Canon 75-300 Lens + 58mm 2x Telephoto lens + 58mm Wide Angle Lens (4 Lens Kit!!!!!!)

I had a 35mm camera a long time ago that I used some for vacations and the like. Because of the cost of buying and developing film I didn't experiment much with it.  After my last debacle with my camcorder, where the sun washing out the LCD screen caused me to miss some once in a life time shots and video, I decided it was time for a good camera that would take stills and video.  I was looking at either Canon or Nikon.  After watching some commercials on the Canon and reading and comparing both I decided that the Canon was the better choice because of the faster fps continuous shooting and better video and still color rendering and many more features.  I now love the world of DSLR! You can play and experiment all day and if the pictures are bad just delete them!  Because it has been so long since I was serious about the art of taking pictures I have to get up to speed once again and this is the perfect camera for it.  If I want to take great pictures all I have to do is put it in auto and zoom and press the shutter button.  On the other hand if I want to go for special effects I can take more control and set the camera up manualy.  It has many features that set up automatically ie: landscape, sports, hand held night, portrait and more.  This camera has SO MANY features that it will take me some time to learn them.  But the best news is that I am having fun doing it.  It is simple enough for a beginner, like me, or for someone who is more advanced.  I would recommend that if you get this camera also purchase David Busch's guide CANON EOS REBEL T4i/650D DIGITAL SLR PHOTOGRAPHY.  It is 500 pages on nothing but this camera and all of it's operations from A to Z.  Lots of illustrations and way better than trying to read the small factory manual.  As for all the other items in the bundle I had no problems.  The box arrived with everything that was listed in it.Cons:  The camera bag and tripod are too small for this camera and all the items.  I bought extra the Amazon basic backpack and it holds all of this and more.  I already have a bigger tripod, for my small camcorder, so I will now use the tripod that came with this bundle for the camcorder and my bigger tripod for this camera.  The other con is shipping.  You have only one option and that is 3 to 5 days.  I thought, at first, that wasn't too bad.  But I discovered what that really means is that they take 3 to 5 days to \" START \" to ship it.  It was a week between ordering and arrival.  If you are in a hurry there is no other option.  In conclusion I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAMERA!!  I've been like a kid in a candy store this week and dream of taking pictures with it at night!  If you are looking for a DSLR that can make you look like a Pro then this is the camera for you.  Don't bother looking any more unless you want different lenses.  This is the best $1000+ that I have every spent and I would do it again in a heart beat!", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": "Dusty \"If you are living life like there is n...", "ReviewID": "R2OSRGVGT4IY2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are thinking about getting a DSLR stop thinking and just do it. I love this camera, do not let the size and all the controls scare you from getting this it is simply amazing what you can do with a real camera I highly advise you to get this one the Canon T4i. This kit comes with almost everything you will need. You will need to buy a camera bag and a tripod, the kit includes these but they are not good at all and the tripod it comes with is a joke I would not put my point and shoot camera on it.

They had a special on and when I did the math, I was getting extras that I planned to buy anyway like the 75-300 lens and the extra batteries for a lot less than it would cost if I bought them all separately.The T4i is a really good camera. I already have a lot of equipment which fits it already. The video quality is amazing. It isn't a game changing update from the T3i but it still has some noticeable improvements.My issue is the rest of the stuff. The tripod is weak and appears unstable (I will probably use it as a GoPro handle). The wide angle and telephoto lens attachments are terrible. The wide angle attachment while it is wider as advertised, it gives an unwanted effect of rounding the photos in the corners. The telephoto attachment on the other hand, you get a couple more millimeters zoom but you lose a lot of sharpness. The bag is really small and the SD card is a brand I've never heard of.This is an ok bundle but not an exceptional one because it just has to many things that I will never use.

The price dropped for this package about $200 in late January up to now. All in all, not bad with all the other accessories for a beginning photographer, just make sure you buy yourself a quality bag to protect the camera/ lenses.

The bag is nice but I wouldn't store my camera in it, but I do use it to cart around my mic and some extra accessories that can be purchased extra.  I wouldn't put a GoPro on the tripod, for fear of it collapsing.  It's very flimsy, but get you can find an extra use for it, I've used it to hold a clamp light...because its all I'd trust to put on my.

Love the camera and the entire bundle!!", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the camera with some caveats about the accesories. Updated.", "Author": "Christopher Younken", "ReviewID": "RX334NWMDVPOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for @ 3 weeks. I am an audio professional who has always wanted to get into photography for the creative enjoyment of it. I bought this camera package on the recommendation of a friend who I work with who is a professional videographer. He bought the same package. The camera has been a joy. I Love it! The photo quality I'm getting is stunningly beautiful even with the kit lenses. I've mainly been using it as a still camera with plans to get into the video capabilities soon.Regarding the accessories in the package is where I have mixed feelings. I give the camera and the lenses 5 stars but for the accessories I'd take off half a star if I could.There are a ton of extras that are things one needs along with the camera when you are starting out like me. That said, I wonder if it might have been better off buying these accessories separately to ensure quality and/or maybe even save money by not buying some of them. Can't say I've gone into the cost comparisons BUT this is what I experienced...The good: The main 2 lenses that come with the camera work well. The lens filter protectors seem fine. The 3 rechargeable batteries, wall charger and 32 GB flash card are great.The shaky: The main tripod is as flimsy and cheap as you can imagine. It may be good for holding a light but I prefer using natural light so it's useless to me. The wide angle attachment exhibits a vignette in the widest position (useless). The camera bag so far is adequate but I know sometime when I am in a hurry to zip the zipper to change a lens to get a shot, it is going to break - sooner than later. The card reader does not fit between my other connectors on my MacBook Pro but I had a USB extension cable. The only problem is: between the card reader not holding the card firmly and the somewhat shaky connection between the USB extension and the card reader, I get the message that I improperly removed the card a lot which scares me that I could lose some files when this happens.I have not used the car charger which is a great thing to have or the telephoto extender (the 75mm - 300mm seems long enough). The table top tripod is cool but too small for the camera it came with (appropriate for a point and shoot), I haven't tried all of the filters either.So, it comes with a lot of good extras and maybe I could have saved some money by buying them separately and not buying some I don't think I need. On the other hand it did cover a lot of bases for what a beginner needs that one might not think of and in the long run learning what you need and don't need is part of the process.Update: After having this package for a few months I want to say unequivocally this is a great deal. Regardless of things I am not happy with the quality of (tripod, the filters are not good, I've tried all of them and lens attachments are useless too) the things I really cared about (camera & lenses) are fantastic and well worth the price even without these extras. I also finally, got the SD card to slide directly into my MacBook Pro and it works like a charm now.This is a great deal.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome camera, super deal!!", "Author": "Mark Schofield", "ReviewID": "R386J1G8MYFNH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "kit came with everything you could possibly want with this phenomenal camera. only negative is the 75-300mm lens is not image stabilized- i tend to shake a little, but it was not labeled as such in the product description, so no misleading info there on the part of the seller. everything was brand new, as described, and shipped very quickly in plenty of time for christmas. i am very pleased with this purchase, and my photographer wife was absolutely thrilled with this camera and all the goodies that came with it.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I just need time to play", "Author": "Novice camera buff", "ReviewID": "R1HBJNX8I27BS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The order came quickly and as listed on Amazon!
