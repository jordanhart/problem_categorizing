My friends and I were backstage at a show and we were able to take photos with the band and have them autograph the photos for us.  Not to mention when was the last time you got a group of people standing around laughing at pictures you just took.As much as I love my new friend maker, there are a number of pros and cons.Pros:The amount of visual effects that can be added to the pictures is staggering considering that this camera is doing a lot to begin with.There are 10 different borders from snowflakes, and hearts to standard Polaroid, and for the vintage peel apart enthusiast there is a border just for you.A multitude of shooting programs from the standard come with every camera (daylight, night, portrait, landscape) to a plethora of fun ones like LOMO, snow (for shooting against snowy background), party, soft skin, flowing water, fisheye, and my personal favorite pre-composition where you can take a picture as a reference first and then shoot the subject in front of the precaptured image.In addition there are also color options like vintage polaroid, b&w;, sepia, and b&w; w/ vignetting.Since it has a memory chip you can give away the printed pictures because have them saved.The Zink paper doesn't tear.Cons:People are so fascinated by it that you will be required to play show and tell. This gets worse once you print because everyone will want a copy for themselves, and even though the Zink paper is cheaper than the Polaroid film was, at approx. $.60 per print this could get expensive fast.The battery will only print about 25 shots before dying.  I also haven't found a place to purchase an additional battery pack.The only way to check the battery is to turn the camera on.  I wish they had put an indicator light on the outside so you can see when it's safe to unplug. I personally prefer to charge my batteries outside of the camera.The camera will only hold 10 sheets of paper at a time.  Which means you are dragging packs of paper with you.The printing process is relatively slow, not quite as slow as waiting for a Polaroid to develop, but it won't be shooting that picture out with the speed of it predecessor.It's the size of the Spectra, so it not going to be sliding into a back pocket or tiny handbag.It does have a learning curve as I kept finding features but then not being able to locate them again later.All in all a well made product that brings back a bit of the Polaroid fun days.  While I agree it is sitting at a bit of a high price point, I don't think you'll be disappointed.And if you are Amazon does returns.P. S. I have read a number of reviews on various other sites with people saying that Polaroid isn't useful any longer as they can capture images with their phones and load directly to Facebook to share.  To those people I can only say you are absolutely correct.  You can do all of those things and this camera is definitely not for you.  Please move on.  You don't get it and quite frankly those who do don't feel like explaining it to you.UPDATE:  THERE IS A CARD IN THE BATTERY SLOT THAT SAYS REMOVE BEFORE INSERTING BATTERY.  IT IS A BIT HIDDEN SO LOOK FOR IT.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "i love my new polaroid it brings back the old good days", "Author": "mimi \"love to party\"", "ReviewID": "R2JFR8DTU7G8NP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you will Hand a ZINK printer to one of your parents and they\u00a1\u00afll probably look at you dumbfounded.  Hand a Polaroid camera to them, though, and they\u00a1\u00afll know instantly what to do with it.  Polaroid, a company that killed off one of their core product offerings to make way for the digital revolution, is finally back with a device that mimics the original form factor of the Polaroid camera yet marries the printer tech of today.This Polaroid Z340 that I just got is an Instant Digital Camera works like a standard 14 megapixel digital point and shoot camera, allowing you to view photos instantly on the 2.7-inch screen as well as make small edits.  Photos can be downloaded to a computer from its SD card or you can print them instantly using the device\u00a1\u00afs built-in printer.  The size of the prints, 3\u00a1\u00c14\u00a1\u00e5, are the same exact size as the first Polaroid camera, which means those with a taste for nostalgia, or perhaps even an aversion to new tech, will instantly understand the offering of this digital camera. The printer, unlike Polaroid\u00a1\u00afs original camera, uses a tech called ZINK \u00a8C it stands for Zero Ink.  In other words, no ink is used to process the image, and instead depends on an advanced composite material with cyan, yellow, and magenta dye crystals embedded inside.  Heat those crystals and an image appears that will last for time to come thanks to a smudge proof tech and a water resistant coating.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R3TTMDV830CZ8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those of you who are old fashioned and still like the old style Polaroid camera will have a blast with this.

Although it did get a paper jam- there is a simple way to fix it. If the paper is not sticking out of the front- do not pull with tweezers- call the Polaroid customer service 1-877-456-6055. Tell them your problem and give them your email. They should send you a folder with instructions and a program update. You will want to copy and paste this program onto the SD card that you insert into your camera- I had to go buy one- they cost anywhere from $10-$20 and they will increase the storage capacity of your camera as well as help you out here. Put the SD card back into the camera. Turn the camera off and slide the button to \"capture\" mode. Then turn on the camera and press \"WIDE\" repeatedly (The instructions said to press power and wide together-but this did not work for me.) The wide button is the button with 3 trees on it. A menu should pop up and select \"computer\" and press \"ok.\" Then let it do its thing for about 3 minutes.

The camera has some really neat modes & features, and the ability to spit out instant prints (which is why I bought it). That being said, the instant prints are only OK in quality. Do your research before you drop the $2.5 hundo on this one, because if you don't know the quality of the prints you're in for you're bound to be dissapointed. That being said, you can always hook the camera up and print out better quality photos via an ink or laserjet. NOTE: I find you get better prints when you dont use the flash.However, if you're a fan of the old polaroid cameras, and love vintage-looking photos you'll have a lot of fun with this camera. I really enjoy that I get to choose the photo that I print! With the old polaroid cameras you wind up with a lot of expensive junk prints. Not so with the Z340. The ability to add borders to your prints adds a sprinkle of photobooth-like charm. This camera is very well thought out for the amateur photographer with lots of fun modes / features / ease of use. If you're out to take fun silly photos, or capture a nice moment & you aren't a super anal photo-snob, you'll have a blast.Dog Owners & Moms will LOVE \"Kid Mode\". It's been an awesome feature that I pretty much use all the time in my dog boutique. I use the camera for the souviner photo portion of my charity events. I advertise the prints as \"vintage\" and the customer gets to pick their photo. Everyone has a good time & Loves it!I also enjoy that the battery is charged while it's in the camera (ac adapter plugs into side of camera). For some reason I hate seperate battery chargers. I ALWAYS Loose them.The only other gripe I have is that there is no view finder. You're completely dependant on the LCD screen. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but it does take a second. And this is a large camera. I loved using the larger polaroids of yore, so I'm ok with a larger camera.Anywho, you can get all this info by just reading other reviews available on the interwebs, so don't be lazy & Do your research!Polaroid, if you're listening, a few requests for the next version:1. a viewfinder.2. better quality prints (Bigger prints? 3x4 is still a bit small)3. Better Materials. Heavier plastic, or even metal would be rad.

The printing quality of the camera is overall disappointing. The photos look great on the LCD, but once printed they are low quality, miscolored, and noisy. If you are going to sell a product for this much money and praise the quality of Zink printing paper and the cameras ability to do so - then I expect it to make at least half-decent prints. I wouldnt have a problem with the camera otherwise. Maybe if Polaroid made more original Polaroid paper for the cameras that are now cherished, there wouldnt be a need for this instant digital Polaroid with results that are nothing like the original.

I bought it primarily because I wanted to have Polaroid-style pictures at a fraction of the Impossible film's cost. The Instax 210 is an awesome camera and I highly recommend it - however, it produces modern-looking, clean pictures (which is great for many applications, of course :-) but I also wanted to have that old-style instant-film look with all it's imperfections. The Z340 delivers exactly that. The pictures aren't as clean as modern prints - the photos sometimes have a slightly reddish tint (as a matter of fact, they look almost identical to what Polaroids used to look like when the original film was still made), they sometimes have minor imperfections. They look awesome to me because they're exactly what I want.Of course, you can also use the Z340 to take pictures to an SD card and have them printed at a photo lab or on your own printer. The 14 megapixel sensor is actually surprisingly good, even in low light. It runs circles around most modern point-and-shoots, that's for sure. The high resolution sensor also allows for the digital zoom to work well without having to worry about picture size afterwards.The handling of the camera is very good. The camera's screen flips up and you hold the cam like you would hold any Polaroid camera. They could have included an optical viewfinder - although one has to say that on most instant cameras you never got a through-the-lens view finder, meaning that the optical one they had actually made it difficult to frame the pictures properly. In that respect, I prefer the screen.All in all, I'm giving this one 5 points. If you're looking for clinically perfect prints, look elsewhere. If you want those cosy family pictures you used to love in the 70s, 80s and 90s, you can't go wrong whit this camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is my favorite camera.", "Author": "Lance Larson", "ReviewID": "R34940JWM6KFAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own plenty of cameras.

Because its a 14Mp camera definitely the resolution is high and pictures are very sharp and vibrant.You can even edit the pictures immediately without requiring any external device like photoshop etc. The viewer is quite big which gives you a magnified view of the shot. They have an exclusive ZINK ( zero ink technology )that make everything inkless, thus avoiding expensive toners or ribbons when printing. Also since it is using rechargeable batteries it will definitely hold a longer charge and wont have any problem bringing spare batteries along.

The new Polaroid Z340 Instant Camera is now available and it's big, cute, packed with features, and it's expensive.Revision: After posting my review and thoughts on this camera, I received numerous emails and comments from my readers.  They wanted more precise and point to point feedback. The Polaroid does not cost $99 to $149.  It cost $299.  Sorry for the confusion.What I like about Polaroid Z340 is the fact it will take pictures in low light and it won't hunt for the subject or the shutter button won't hesitate to click.  I like the style, design, and it's pretty similar (build) like the old polaroids.  After watching the videos on this product, I had to get it. So, please check out youtube for videos before getting it.HOWEVER, this Polaroid is expensive and will bang your wallet for $300 bucks.  It's totally overpriced and I will only pay $ 99 to $ 149 for this camera.The features I don't like about this camera is the handle strap on the right side of the camera, the high glare on the screen, and the print out of the images.If you use the hand strap, you have to avoid hitting the shutter buttons or other switches. There isn't any place to rest your hands but against the buttons which will change the camera settings. The LCD screen adjustment is normal, bright, or auto.  It's too bright for a 2.7\" screen.  The color bleeds.  The battery life is REALLY, REALLY, and I mean REALLY bad. You can only take 75 pictures or print 25 photos before the battery goes dead. UCK! If you had a point and shoot or a smart-phone, you can take pictures all night, never miss a shot, hide it in your pocket, make a phone call, text a friend or two, and you won't have to recharge until the event is over.If you use the Polaroid Z340 at events or at parties, you will need to buy a backup rechargeable batteries ($25 ea). If you are printing all night, you would need at least 2 packs of the Zink \"3x4\" paper which is also expensive ($ 20 for 30 sheets).As much as I wanted to like this cute Polaroid Z340 camera, I can't.  The price is very hard to swallow, the photo sheets are very expensive,  and the print out is too flat, no detail, and has a hue (orange/yellow) tint.  These days you can capture great images with a smartphone or a point and shoot camera and print it on a wirelessly bluetooth printer.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "caitlyne", "ReviewID": "RCV8BYFPQWFCK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It doesn't print the photos like old school Polaroids.

Digital, rechargeable, snap, print, share - no computer connections.  I knew she would love it, which she did.  But I couldn't resist at first presenting it as my own Christmas present that I purchased for myself to try out.  She was green with envy.
