{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung consistently great products", "Author": "Sal Goldberg \"meIyou but not 'they'\"", "ReviewID": "RXHFEM1DYZSZH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung camera has some incredible basic features as well as some more advanced or complex ones.  First, quality of pictures are outstanding.  The easy to access (right on top of camera) dual view screen in front is outstanding for pix of self OR to allow others in picture to see how they look, if they're centered and so on, need to adjust smile.  As for the wi-fi features, this again is very simple and one of main reasons for my purchase.  Easily and quickly able to send pictures via e-mail or to social sites.  Lots and lots of other features to fine tune pix that you may choose to utilize or not.  In any event, after one month, I feel this is a great camera (16.2mp)with outstanding picture quality and exceptionally 'user friendly', and great value especially at sale price of $139.95!  ENJOY!", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "not as good as the PL120", "Author": "PJB", "ReviewID": "R350W3BKI7WSKG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought the Samsung PL120 for a family member earlier this year, wanted the front screen feature. That is a good, not great, camera.  This DV300 has performed poorly in the weeks I have owned it. Poor battery life, Samsung smart menu that takes too long to decide how to take a photo, so you miss shots.  Even on manual mode it is slow to react.  The front screen is very hard to see so almost not worth having there. The hassle of having a miniSD card is more than I thought, full size SD card is more convenient. I'll be passing this along to somebody in the family and get myself another Canon.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Jackie Davis", "ReviewID": "R1EH2TY8LE9ND5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absoulty love this camera. I have a Canon with interchangeable lens but this is great for the beach, to carry in your purse and you can download to facebook, etc. with wi-fi the pictures and put in a comment.

Wonderful and the price on Amazon was great", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung DV300F dual view smart camera", "Author": "silver fox \"harvey\"", "ReviewID": "R3UFZYI8Q9HONZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the pictures it takes-but annoyed that supposedly it only works on computers that Windows 7-if I get a new computer with windows 8 will samsung provide an upgrade also for the camera--but the price was amazing and the photos that I have taken have been really good.

The wifi functionality is impressive, not easy to set up but works well. The front LCD is a bit of a gimmick, I don't expect to use it much. The interface with my Samsung smartphone is really nice, I can view what the camera is seeing and even take a picture with it. It takes quite some time to take a picture when the flash is involved as it needs to charge it for each picture, especially the first one.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Marvelous", "Author": "Andr\u00e9s", "ReviewID": "R2Z38KRFVEDF9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung camera have incredible and funny functions, is very compact and easy handling!

I purchased it for a trip to Costa Rica,  to take pictures in the rainforests.... This camera is incredibly slow at snapping photos...when you depress the picture button, it may be 2-4 seconds before the actual picture is taken.

I mean, it does the job, good price - the front facing viewfinder is mainly why I got it, but the quality of any front-facing pictures is similar to that of a cellphone's front-facing camera quality. But hey, no more guessing if you're in the shot or not ;) Overall it takes good pictures; even though it looks rather \"plastic-y\" on the outside. I guess Samsung isn't too concerned with aesthetics as I am haha", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Fran garcia", "ReviewID": "R2BV0N6S9RTFJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Missing front lcd wiever.

I am a single dad and when I have time with my daughter, I don't have anyone to take pictures of us.  So I researched this camera up the wazzoo, and was delighted to find out that it had a remote camera function via smart phones.  Nothing ever specified that is had to be a Samsung smart phone.  I just wanted to be able to use my phone as a remote to take pictures of my daughter and I. If you own Samsung devices... good for you.  But don't waste your time, as many of the fancy smartphone features can't be used if you don't have a Samsung smartphone or device.I'm pretty unhappy.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007BA00B6"}}
