{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First Day Impressions - Fantastic Little Camera", "Author": "Karen Kelly \"aka lizard, a geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2YOP461OB9VV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this camera because I wanted to step up from my old Panasonic TZ5. I've had several digital cameras over the years, all of them point-and-shoot with CCD sensors. I've not used DSLRs much at all, so my perspective is different from those with high-end cameras for whom this is their portable camera. This camera lives up to my expectations, which are probably quite different from some of the other reviewers.For my first day, I kept the camera on the EXR setting and let it make my decisions, it did a very good job of figuring out what to do in the different situations, but as I go on it will be necessary to familiarize myself with the menus and manual shooting options in order to get the results I want. I'm giving the camera 5 stars because the images I got with only a cursory glance at the manual were quite lovely, and I fully expect to be able to improve on them as I learn more about the wide variety of settings. Another reason this camera gets all 5 of the stars from me is that I'm a geek, and so the impressive amount of technical bells & whistles on the F550EXR really appeals to me.Feel, fit, and finish: really solid little camera, emphasis on the \"little\" -- I have average-sized hands and the camera felt quite small in my hands, I can imagine someone with large hands would find it a bit awkward to hold. Like the other reviewers, I found the position of the pop-up flash quite awkward, it will take some getting used to. I wonder if that placement could have been better if they'd just made the camera a little bit bigger? The controls are intuitive but they are quite small, made me really glad I don't have big fingers.Zoom: fast and fantastic. I'll post a couple of pictures when I finish to show the wide/zoom comparison. Clarity at full resolution with handheld, full-zoom shots was sufficient to recognize people standing at the end of my street, about a couple hundred yards.Focus and responsiveness: having never owned a DSLR, the quickness of the shutter response was a little startling at first, I'm used to timing my shots to account for a significant delay, if you're coming from a CCD sensor camera this will make a huge difference for you. The focus is quick and with the anti-shake, all my handheld shots (even at full zoom) were sharp and clear. Taking pictures of a hotel about a mile and a half from here, I could read their sign.Color: like the 'negative' review I found the colors a little bit de-saturated in many shots, but then I discovered that in EXR mode, you should select \"dynamic range\" priority.  There are a *lot* of settings and options, do explore them. Colors and clarity in low light with no flash are quite lovely, again, comparing this to a CCD sensor, it's a whole different world. I do wish there were more than three color choices (film simulation, B&W;, and sepia) -- with my last Panasonic there was a \"vivid\" option which would have been a good on this camera. However, I concede that the camera has abilities well beyond such a simple setting, there's just a bit of a learning curve.Video: The full HD movies are quite good, and the sound was great, I was taking movies at the beach with a brisk breeze and the microphones picked up mostly ocean sound and very little wind noise. I was somewhat disappointed to find that the resolution for 320FPS high speed video was a very odd 320 x 112, but since this slows things down more than 10x, I don't think I'll be using that setting much. The 320 x 240 at 160FPS still slows things down more than 5X and is a much more useful resolution. Even better is the 640 x 480 at 80FPS, big enough to show detail and slow enough to capture things you can't make out with the naked eye.GPS / Points of Interest: It may be that there aren't enough POI in my area to make that feature very useful, I pointed the camera in the general direction of (but not directly at) the City Hall and it thought I was there. Still, the GPS is very accurate and uploads to Flickr are pinpointed within a few yards.I'll update this review as I gain more experience with the camera, but overall I have to say I'm very satisfied with my choice.**UPDATE** I feel I was in too much of a hurry to post this review, and should have given myself some time to learn the camera. The main things I'd like to add are:Criticism of \"washed out\" images -- this just doesn't apply if you use the right settings. Full manual mode yields beautiful rich tones and wonderful detail, including lovely shots with subtle bokeh at f3.5.Macro: detail is lovely and creamy smooth, the CMOS sensor on this camera is really very wonderful.My best advice to you is to read the manual, and take your time getting to know the features. I love this little camera very, very much on this, my third day with it.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Early Impressions from Day One - Review FinePix F550EXR", "Author": "SuperDad", "ReviewID": "R22PY14XXOUV4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "11/2012 update. Unfortunately, the lens stopped retracting properly on our yellowstone trip in August and the camera was stolen from our rental car. Big bummer to have lost the photos; at least the thief got a non functioning camera.  i see from later reviews that this lens problem is common.  Before bashing Fuji, i see similar complaints with Canon (S100 for example).  Hoping to find a viable replacement.I couldn't wait to use this camera for the first time.  For background, I've owned digital cameras dating back to the Apple Quicktake 150 (1995) and many in-between (Olympus, Toshiba, Canon, Nikon).  Current arsenal consists of a Canon Digital Rebel XT with several lenses and a Nikon CoolPix S200.  I got the FinePix 550EXR with the intent of having a portable point-shoot camera for situations where the Canon SLR isn't practical and like the option of GPS tagging.  I've been disappointed with the autofocus accuracy and weak flash of the Nikon Coolpix 200, hence this purchase.Controls: 3.5Controls are pretty straightforward.  The round selector has the usual features (flash on, menu access, self timer, etc.) and also a nice jog shuttle wheel (command dial) that will scroll through menus and settings as well.  The camera shipped with the GPS off.  LCD image quality is very good (bright, clear).  I miss the optical viewfinder of my SLR, but those are very rare these days on compacts except for certain expensive prosumer models. I would like to have the option for direct access to GPS on/off without having to access the menu.  Attention camera manufacturers: provide the option for a user-programmable button where one can select ANY menu item for quick access to a 'favorite'.  Charging is accomplished via an included charger.  I would like to see camera manufacturers also provide the option to charge via USB with the battery left in the camera.  Many other devices already do this and this is very helpful when you need to travel light.  Else, people use horrible cell phone cameras due to their portability.  The charger in this case for example is nearly the same size as the camera itself.  (Fujifilm, take note; Canon and Nikon also are making this same mistake).GPS: 3.5Be sure to confirm the menu settings for the GPS to turn it on. One setting has the GPS set to \"permanently on\", which means it is using battery even with the power off to determine the GPS location.  While this is useful for if you intend to spend a day on the run and want quick acquisition of the signal for photos, it certainly has impact on battery.  I suggest keeping it to \"when switched on\" if you are willing to wait for a few moments for the satellites to be acquired.  I found that it does work indoors (tested in a single story home), although with a weaker signal reception as compared to my cell phone or Garmin GPS.  Best results are outdoors for sure.  There is an icon of a satellite that blinks while it is acquiring the signal and a signal strength displayed in bars.  I found that the GPS data does properly come through to applications like Aperture, iPhoto, etc.  There is a great deal of useful metadata that the camera provides for the photos.  The \"location\" option will display a text name of a nearby location in the camera's database.  In my case, it named a park about 1 mile away and you can also view the Long/Latitude.  Note it appears that per the manual - the GPS location database is not able to be updated by the user.  In my case it is from October 2010.  I wish that there was a utility where this can be updated via USB and also the user can store their own location names. (I.E. Home, Grandparents Home, etc.)  Perhaps this will be a future option. That said, there are utilities where you can add this feature to your photo's metadata once the image is on your computer.  The GPS does have an impact on battery life.  If you are a heavy GPS user on the run, I suggest getting a spare battery.Build quality/Durability: 4.0Build appears to be solid.  The one exception for me is that the pop-up flash and its motorized function seems a bit delicate.  Its location on the left is also is in a bit of an unfortunate spot as (at least for me) it is exactly where I want to place a finger (corner) to hold the camera if I am using two hands.  Unfortunately the GPS receiver directly above the lens does not allow for the flash to be located elsewhere.  That said, the flash is powerful and provides good coverage.  The flash is motorized (up/down).  You can manually disable the flash by simply closing it.  The screen will then show the \"flash off\" symbol. One can also safely hold the camera from the corner when the flash is closed or you can move your finger to the side of the camera and still achieve 2-hand photos with the flash up - I recommend having the camera strap installed and in use to avoid any risk of dropping the camera.Image quality, AutoFocus and Shutter Performance: 4.0My tests are very early and limited to evening hours outdoors and indoor lighting.  I will provide a more detailed review and update my rating after a trip to Orlando, FL on the weekend.  Initial photo tests yield good results for this camera, although not as good as my Canon Rebel XT (not that I necessarily expect them to be as good as an SLR).  Autofocus speed is excellent and accurate in my initial tests.  There is no discernible shutter lag.  Image quality, shutter performance and autofocus are superior to the Canon Coolpix S200.  Wide, zoom, and macro focus photos are very good.  For example, I get excellent focus with less than 1/2 inch from the lens to the subject!  I have not tested the extent of barrel distortion / pincushion in these initial tests.  The capability for RAW and RAW+JPEG files is a big benefit of this camera.Video: April 24, 2011 update  2.9Video quality is acceptable for a point/shoot camera.  I have tested via 1080p and also via fast shutter.  The camera does not ship with an HDMI cable.  It does ship with a video RCA and audio RCA cable. If you are expecting video on the quality of an AVCHD video camera such as those from Canon, you will be disappointed.  That said, it is acceptable in a pinch and exceeds video quality of my Nikon point & shoot as well as cell phones. (I expected it to).Startup, Shutdown Speeds: 4.5Press the on button and the camera is ready to take a picture in 2.5 seconds.  Turning off takes about 2.3 seconds.  For comparison, my Nikon Coolpix S200 is about 2.2 secondsOverall Review: 4.0.  Initial impressions are quite positive and I am happy with my purchase.  April 24th: same assessment (4.0)April 24th update:  Upon return from Florida, I can share that I am still pleased with this camera.  I found it to be highly versatile in multiple challenging lighting situations.  As I expected, it doesn't perform as well as my Canon Digital SLR, but it is an acceptable option for those trips where I need a high degree of portability.  I have posted several updated photos from more recent adventures (a few Florida samples and a recent Tulip field visit).", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feature packed capable camera with some good and some bad", "Author": "mypotbelly", "ReviewID": "RI9FLRFOFYZ5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE: Update firmware if you have not done it already. F550 has new firmware (v1.10 at the time of writing this review) available from Fujifilm website.This is my second review of this camera. I removed my original review to correct/update based on additional usage of the camera.Disclaimer:  Currently I have Canon SD3500 (~1 year), T1i (~2 years), and Fujifilm F550 (2 weeks).I was looking for pocket 'travel zoom' camera for sometime to bridge between my ultra compact camera and dSLR. I love my Canon T1i but it is too bulky to carry in casual setting. I did research on several models including this camera, Sony Hx9v, Nikon 9100, and Canon SX230. After fair amount of research, I was little hesitant to purchase this camera (due to my prior experience with Fuji) but I bought this camera after going through one good review (kimletkeman's blog)... although it turns out that he did not have full review yet at the time of my purchase :)Ok, here are some highlights:PROs:1. Rich feature set - wide angle, 15x optical zoom, BSI CMOS, Full HD (1080) video, RAW image, GPS, etc. This camera is feature packed.2. Build - Build quality on this unit is very good. It looks great and feels good in hand. Mode dial is easy to control while you are taking photo/video.3. RAW Image - Out of the rich feature set, RAW image capability requires a special mention. Among the 'pocket' Travel Zoom camera available today, this camera is the only camera that gives you ability to capture images in RAW format (.RAF file).4. Firmware upgradeability - Yes, you can update firmware on this camera just like you can update iOS on your iPod/iPhone/iPad... yes, little more manual process is required but it is fairly simple task.CONs:1. Blurry photo - I hope all my camera can give good quality photo every time I press shutter button. In my experience of taking ~700 shots so far, I am getting about 5% or more of blurry photo. Based on my experience, Canon P&S; camera gives far less blurry photos. Yes, I do admit that it may have to do with operator error, but you are talking about the same operator taking photo :)2. 1080 video - there are two problems that I am experienced so far.  a) focus hunting - While you are taking video in full HD, you'll experience focus going in & out. It does not hold the focus and you'll end up with blurry video at times.  b) auto exposure - if you take video indoor, you will notice that video are dark and you do not have control. Although Fujifilm did not say that they addressed video exposure issue with their latest firmware update, it feels the video is better in dark room after the update.3. Body design - Location of the flash may interfere with your grip, this may require you to learn to hold different way. In addition, it is not easy to take memory card in and out of this camera.4. EXR mode - this mode is something I am still figuring out. It feels this was to be 'super auto' mode but it does not always give good results. I often have difficulty in autofocus when I zoom in somewhat. I like some pictures from this mode, but you do not have control between L and M size pictures as the camera decides the size automatically. Granted that M size is the best size to give the highest photo quality, it may not matter at the end.Others:1. GPS - GPS takes some time to get signal, however my portable GPS systems do that as well. So, you might not take full advantage of geotagging with this camera if you are indoor or you are in hurry to take photos.2. Image Quality - some pictures that I took came out really great. Some photos just came out terrible with out-of-focus, etc. Yes, it may be operator error... I'll take it as half glass full. This camera certainly has potential to give good images.3. RAW image capability may be the greatest feature of this camera. However the RAF format is not compatible with many photo editing software, i.e. Adobe Photoshop and Apple Aperture will not take the RAF file.I thank kimletkeman's blog for the information on this camera. I stumbled upon his blog going through dpreview's discussion threads. If you are still thinking about purchasing this camera and need more information, look for his blog on the web.All in all, you get lots of features with this camera. There are some good in this camera, and there are some bad... and hopefully Fujifilm can address them with their future firmware updates.UPDATE: 11-MAY-2011====================I took the Fujifilm F550EXR out to San Francisco last week and used it extensively. Here are some of the experience I had:- On bright day light, this camera does a wonderful job. My photo of Golden Gate Bridge, taken at bright day light, was clear and crisp- Low light photo gave me some blurry photo. I believe this is limitation of the electronic image stablization system that camera uses. If you can hold your camera really steady, you can get decent pictures.- GPS tagging info was somewhat problematic. I went over to Coit Tower and came back to Washington Square, and took some photo, and my camera still said the photo was taken at Coit Tower. I saw the camera was still acquiring the GPS signal, I would have preferred if camera didn't tag photo with old GPS info.Comment on Electronic Image Stablization-----------------------------------------On the way back form S.F., I had about 40 minutes to 'kill' at the S.F. airport. I walked into an electronic shop at the airport and played with a Panasonic ZS8. It comes with Optical Image Stablization system, and I zoomed all the way out at 15x and took picture of the menu at the nearby coffee shop. When I displayed it on the camera, I was able to read the menu. Wow.Then I took my Fujifilm F550 out and did the same. I looked at the resulting photo and image was all blurry. I took it again, and this time I really held camera steady and held my breadth, and I also used 2 second timer to limit effect of my shutter button... Well, image was somewhat better but not as good as Panasonic ZS8.I wished my Fujifilm has the optical image stablization system as ZS8 does. At least you don't get as much of blurry photo. On the other hand, I believe Fujifilm image was little more clear when photo was taken at normal zoom. I believe Fujifilm F550 does have better \"JPEG\" compression engine than Panasonic.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Music Critic", "ReviewID": "RLVZSAET4QKE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent little camera! Over the last 10 years I have owned 2 P&S; cameras (one Canon, one Olympus), and 2 DSLRs. I currently use a Canon T2i for most of my shooting. But I have missed a lot of shots over the last couple of years simply because I didn't have a camera with me, usually because, for one reason or another, it just wasn't appropriate or feasible to bring the DSLR. So with the current crop of new small cameras coming out this Spring, I decided to remedy that situation. I quickly narrowed the field to 3: this camera, the Canon SX230HS, and the Panasonic ZS10. I would say my main concerns were: small size (easily pocketable), good image quality, wide-angle lens, manual controls, lots of neat features (like face detection/recognition, ae bracketing, panorama, etc), good low-light capability, and HD video capability. All three of these cameras provide those features to a varying extent, but it really came down to image quality. I looked for whatever reviews I could find, both for these cameras and for the models that they were replacing. The reviews for the Canon and the Panasonic were good, but uneven, while all the reviews I read for the Fuji consistently applauded its image quality. Also, the Fuji was the only one to save in the RAW format, and it had the widest angle lens. Basically, the F550 was the best over-all package, at least for me. All three also have built-in GPS, which is nice but wasn't essential for me. After using it awhile, I am very satisfied.In order to get the most out of this camera, you really have to read the manual and get familiar with all its modes. The mode I tend to use the most is P (Program), but I do use all the modes regularly. Some of the mode settings overlap to some extent, so there are, for example, at least 3 different settings you could use for low light photos, but each one has its own slight differences that might make one a better fit in a certain type of low-light situation. These are all in addition to the manual modes, of course (M, A, and S). The EXR setting is the most automatic, and I do use it sometimes, but I mostly use P, which gives you a little more control over more settings. At first it was pretty confusing, but the combination of the mode dial, the control wheel, and the software interface all work together well so that if you read the manual and then just play around a bit, it becomes very easy. There is also a function button that gives quick access to the most used features for any given mode. I have printed a number of photos (4x6) right from the memory card, without any post-processing, and they look great. I have taken maybe a dozen RAW shots and used the provided software to process them. The software (a version of Silkypix) works, but I'm not crazy about it. I shoot only RAW with my T2i, and I process it with LR3, so maybe there's a certain bias there, I don't know. But you can use it to save the RAW photos in 16 bit TIF, and then process it however you like with not much loss of detail. Hopefully, LR and ACR will eventually recognize this RAW format, but that could be awhile.I should mention some of the things that I don't like about the camera, although there aren't many. I'll start with one thing that I didn't like at first, but have grown to appreciate. That's the flash popping up. Every time you start the camera (or even move from playback mode to camera mode) the flash pops up from the left side (as you're holding it). Not a great place for the flash to start with, but the fact that it pops up automatically can be irritating. However, you can push it down manually, and it will lock there until you want to use it, when you can pop it up manually (it sticks up a tiny bit). Eventually, I found that I actually like the ability to turn the flash on or off just by manipulating the flash head, rather than going through the menus, which would be the alternative. So that can be a plus, a minus, or a wash. The battery does not last long. I didn't actually make a careful count of how many shots I got with a full charge, but I can tell you that in the past week I've taken about 1,000 shots. I've replaced the battery 3 times. Now, some of that time I had the GPS on the \"on all the time\" mode, which means the GPS is on even when the camera is off. I found that that sucks battery power quickly. I finally changed it so that the GPS is on only when the camera is on. I also found that the GPS is accurate, but not overly powerful. It does not work inside my house or my work building (a one story building), it does not work in my car unless it has already picked up a signal outside the car. And I don't understand that, because my cell phone picks up GPS almost anywhere, and it's smaller than the camera. But it is a cool feature and I'm glad it's there. In addition to GPS, the face detection is also a big drain on the battery, But I leave it on because that's one reason I bought it to begin with - I want something I can pick up and immediately start taking pictures without adjusting anything. Finally, it is a small camera. That's good, but I still find it a bit uncomfortable to take pictures with. Part of it is the small size, and part is the lack of a viewfinder. But I'm getting there.Bottom line - I'm really having a blast taking pictures with this camera. So much so, that I think my T2i is feeling a bit neglected. Every time I start to think \"if only I had my 100mm macro lens\", or \"my 50mm 2.8\", I find something else on the F550 that's just so darn fun that those other thoughts disappear! And I think that's the real story here - it's just really really fun.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Average user with a F550exr on vacation", "Author": "dude", "ReviewID": "R3B4RX5WBOOZQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came to this camera from a F10.  The F10 makes great pic's, but a lot of them would be blurry.  So I got this new one for vacation to get more quality pictures.  Took this one on a cruise and it was great.  I'm not even remotely close to being a photographer, just your average Joe.  I wanted a camera that would take great pic's without all the blur, just point, shoot, and move on to the next thing.  I set the camera on EXR mode, Had the advanced anti blur turned on, and let the camera do it's thing automatically.  Out of 1100 pictures taken, I had less than 50 blurry and a couple of red-eye.  About 1/4 of the pictures taken, was me just holding the camera out with one hand in the direction i wanted a picture and depressing the button.  I couldn't be more happier with the results.  Even at 15x zoom, I got some amazing photos.  I played around with some settings like the tracking mode to where the camera tracks objects and would auto focus on them, which worked great at the aquarium when picturing fish on the go.  It even has a setting on the timer that it will only take pictures when it detects faces, which came in super handy when holding up the camera to self snap pic's of girlfriend and I, it'll keep snapping photos until you turn it off.  Nice!Video... not so great, it was choppy on it's highest setting, I was using a 8gb class 10 memory card. My droid x does better quality; However, it IS a real expensive phone.  It would be nice to use the camera, instead of putting it away and digging out my phone if i wanted to video the grand kids.  I know that I bought a camera and not a camcorder, but it was a little disappointing, since my F10 does great video for a camera.  Maybe if I dropped it down to a lower setting, like 720 instead of 1080, it would be better.  Maybe it's just a setting that I need to hunt out.  Again, I'm just an average user that wants to point, shoot, and move, and not fiddle around with settings.  Maybe Fuji will come out with a software fix that will rectify the issue.  I read a couple other reviews that had the same issue with video on 1080.Battery life.... I don't know about other cameras, but my F10 would go days on a charge, about 400-500 pic's with flash, and would last months just sitting around waiting to be used.  This one, lasted a few hours to a day, depending on how much I used it (gps, advanced anti blur, auto focus all turned on).  I didn't keep track of photos per charge, but 1100 photos, 8 days, averages 137.5 a day.  So definitely get a spare battery.  I had one, and used often (not more than once a day).  The quality pictures that I got made it all worth while for me.  Two batteries would be enough for the average person like me.Build quality.  Feels pretty solid.  Not too heavy, not light either though.  Fit into my pocket easily without being overly bulky.  I had to send the camera back in, waiting for a replacement.  The shutter door that protects the lens wouldn't shut after the second day.  I'm sure it's a fluke, because looking at other cameras, they had the exact same looking shutter doors (yes, other brands besides fuji).Settings.  More than I'll ever use.  Interface is pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  Wasn't too different from my F10.Overall, To me and my girlfriend, we were thoroughly amazed with the quality of the photos.  We viewed them on a 55 inch big screen, and was blown away!  Amazing detail, and the colors were as we saw them with our own eyes. Printing out pic's, wow!  Really nice.  Even though I'm a little disappointed in the video quality on 1080, I'm still satisfied with the camera and am happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Up to Expectations", "Author": "Thomas Hyatt", "ReviewID": "R34D5STAA980A3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After reading all the specs and looking at the details for what I was hoping would be a great camera, I have to say I am disappointed with the Fujifilm 550EXR. For me, image quality is everything so I compared the images I took with the 550 to a couple of other cameras. One was the little Panasonic DMC-FX-33 and the other was the Sony NEX5. I knew that the Fuji would not stack up well against the Sony (since the sensor for that camera is SLR size) but I expected it to easily outshine the three year-old Panasonic. However, in almost every case, the Fuji was not able to compete or was no better than the Panasonic. What was most striking was that both color fidelity in all sorts of different shooting situations and image clarity in both daylight and artificial light were really lacking. Highlights at times were clipped, colors in some shooting circumstances appeared muddy and lacked punch that both the Sony and Panasonic had and, most disheartening, low-light shooting was not at all what it was touted to be. In too many situations detail was lost, pictures appeared grainy and colors were muted.On the other hand, the camera is a joy to hold, the 15x zoom is amazing and the build quality seems outstanding. One fiddly thing is that each time you turn on the camera, the flash POPS up just where your left hand might be holding the camera. You can press it back down but having it always come up seems really unnecessary. Size is just perfect, amazing to have such a little package with such a powerful zoom.I have not tried many of the advanced features like GPS. I did get images using the PRO lowlight function which seemed to work pretty well. I really hate not being able to give the camera a good review. One of my first digital cameras was a Fuji which I used for years and loved.I really wanted to like this camera because, on paper, it seemed to have it all.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Neat features, but its best trick is flawed", "Author": "Dennis C. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1TRVCNXX2WYER", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you look at the spec sheet for this camera, it looks like a dream come true.  Although if you have experience interpreting specs you'll realize that the combination of a small sensor, a relatively slow lens, and too many megapixels will pose challenges in low light.  This Fuji can't can't compete with the luxury compacts that have larger sensors, much faster lenses, and fewer megapixels:  costlier pocketable cameras like the Canon S95, Olympus XZ-1, and the Panasonic LX-5.  But then none of those offer more than a 5x zoom or more than 720p video.  In a pocket size camera, the choice is a fast lens OR a long zoom, but not both.But the most tantalizing promise of this camera is its unique (to Fuji EXR sensors) ability to take two different exposures simultaneously.  These can then be combined to capture more dynamic range than otherwise possible.  In contrasty situations this gives you both shadow detail and highlight detail where most cameras would show areas of all black or all white.There are other cameras (and more coming) with \"dynamic range mode\", but they take 2 (or sometimes 3) varying exposures in sequence to do the same thing. But any movement between these exposures ruins the result.  Apple's iPhone 4 camera has such a feature, and in shots where you manage to hold it still, the results are spectacular.  I used my iPhone4 to snap some shots in a redwood forest where there were areas of sunlight alternating with deeply shaded areas.  Amazingly, almost all the detail was captured in the HDR shot (the iPhone 4 takes both normal and HDR shots automatically) but the normal shot \"clipped\" the shadows and highlights leaving many areas all black or all white.  But 2 out of 3 of my shots were blurred in spite of my best efforts to hold the phone steady.Fuji's EXR sensors can take 2 different exposures at once, making it possible to get high dynamic range shots reliably without needing a tripod.  Other sensors can't do this because their pixels are in rows and columns, whereas Fuji's pixels are laid out like interlocking hexagons.  Because cameras capture 3 colors, this three-axis layout means there are always two adjacent pixels of the same color.  So half the pixels take one exposure and the other half take the other.  You lose some resolution, but with the F550's 16 megapixels, you're still left with a 8 megapixel picture.  Still very high resolution.  At least theoretically.The EXR settings do indeed capture incredible dynamic range.  They can maintain detail in contrasty scenes that other cameras would lose.  From a hill in San Francisco I took some shots of the city scape lit by the late afternoon sun where buildings were directly lit and foliage areas were deeply shaded.  The EXR settings kept the detail in the brightly lit buildings while the other settings did not.There was just one problem.  If you zoomed into the pixel level you would see alarming amounts of noise everywhere below the brightness midpoint.  Not enough, perhaps, to be bothersome in a small print, but at page size it's very disturbing.  The obvious solution to this would be to lower the ISO settings and use a longer exposure.  Almost all digital cameras allow this adjustment, as does this Fuji, EXCEPT when you shoot in EXR mode where you can not set ISO below 400.  Though this setting is a maximum ISO none of the shots I took used anything lower even when the high setting was unnecessary.  Instead I got unnecessarily fast shutter times.I might have accepted this as a limitation of the technology except for one thing.  I happen to own Fuji's first EXR camera, the F200exr.  It has the same technology and EXR modes, and it uses lower ISO settings for EXR exposures, but even when EXR exposures occur at ISO 400, the noise is only a tiny fraction of what you get with the F550.  True, the F200 has a larger sensor, a slightly faster lens, and 25% fewer pixels.  Even so, the difference in noise is just too great.  I strongly suspect there is an engineering flaw built in to this design and I hope it can be remedied with a firmware update.  The other possibility could be the sensor itself which unlike the CCD sensor of the F200 is a CMOS type which facilitates the full HD video.Before you let this ruin your enthusiasm for this camera, I'd like to report that the non-EXR results are quite good.  Noise is way lower, especially at lower ISO settings.  I get the same tonal smoothness as with the F200, which is why I can't believe the EXR functions are working properly.  And that 15x zoom is addictive.  Sitting on a park bench in the late afternoon I noticed a half moon above so I snapped it at full zoom.  You can actually see the craters on the moon.  The lens seems quite sharp although I noticed some intense reds seem to bleed.Because the F550 can capture RAW format files, I suggest using this format instead of the EXR for high contrast scenes.  You can get quite a bit of the clipped information back this way, although you'll have to struggle with the powerful but alien converting software that comes with the camera.  Adobe RAW will not open Fuji RAW files.  You can use the Fuji software to create 16 bit TIFF files to import into Photoshop if you prefer and do the processing there.  It's quite a chore and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't want to bother.Incidentally, the in-camera processing (except for EXR mode) seems quite excellent.  The JPEGS strike a nice balance between resolution and noise.  I'm not a professional but I don't think you can get better results processing RAW files in Photoshop, so why bother?There are some video issues I saw covered in other reviews so I won't repeat them.Another fun and useful feature is the panorama shooting.  You can make it work using it handheld, but the probability of success if far greater with a tripod.  If you don't keep the camera level while sweeping the scene the stitching will malfunction.Overall, this is a great bright light camera, even without the EXR function.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm F550EXR Good Stills unacceptable video", "Author": "Quinbould \"knowledgebuff\"", "ReviewID": "R386WLMMTON18M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the F550EXR here at Amazon.  I was so excited to get it...I'd read all the hype about it over an over and I was sure it was a great camera for me... And it would have been if only the HDVideo weren't defective. When you attempt to zoom in video the image goes utterly out of focus to blurry blotches. It then refocuses after you stop zooming. But it's so bad you can't tell what you're zooming on, or where you are.  I thought it was just my camera, but I went on the web and it appears to be a problem with this camera's design. Fuji opted to NOT include the excellent phase change AF used in earlier models and stuck strictly to contrast focus. There is hope that the video performance can be fixed with a firmware update, but I couldn't take that chance or wait for that. 17th Street Photo was very good about taking it back.  I'd only had it over a weekend.  So they're good people to work with.Other observations.  Many of the really cool functions on this camera work well, especially the panorama which I tested and was impressed.  The controls are well located and easy to operate. They claim the high contrast screen is easier to see, but I don't think so.  The mechanical image stabilization doesn't come close to my Lumix zs7's in-lens system.  But I have to say that my long zoom images came out very nice.I do hope the megapixel race is nearing it's maximum.  The images from the 550EXR are beautiful at full screen size (I have a 21\" screen) but if you do some pixel peeking you'll see a lot of noise and blotching in the jpg.  The RAW capability is very handy.  I was able to get better results with RAW data in SilkyPix and then in Photoshop than I was straight out of the camera with native jpg, but it's a lot of fuss and bother. The HDRI function also seems to work well, especially in low light.  So if still images are what you want, I'd say go for it.

Had been using a Panasonic DMC-ZS7 as my P&S; until my last trip in December to Egypt and somehow got dust on the sensor which shows up on all pictures.  Cost to send it somewhere to get cleaned is $125 with no guarantees it will be done right plus any excuse to buy a new toy.Decided replacement Camera should have GPS as the ZS7 had one. It is a good conversion piece among fellow travelers and  watching it load on  Google World then comparing other's pictures to yours of the same sights is interesting  but I could have lived without it however what the heck.  Wide angle in a P&S; is a must for the type of pictures I take and 27MM is as low as I will go and prefer < 25MM.  In addition wanted a max range in the 300MM's  The 550EXR fit my bill and in spite of the lack of reviews and paying list price the  specs,  zoom and technology on this camera convinced me to take a chance.So far......Size I do have large hands and this camera feels small- spec wise it's the same as  the ZS7 but sure feels a lot smaller.  Still trying to get comfortable holding it.  Pop up flash automatically extending is a pain and feels flimsy.  I can see it breaking off if camera is quickly shoved in pocket with it extended. Plastic door for USB conections etc. also is a very weak link and I can see it breaking off easily.LCD-in bright sunshine like every other LCD - point and pray.  Very sharp however in playback and in shade.Daylight pictures very sharp - played with the EXR Dynamic range modes and didn't see much of a difference however took a very limited amount of pictures.  Zoom sharpness excellent in daylight hasn't tried in low light yet and the stabilization kept max zooms distorstation free.  Panoramic function works like a charm and was fun using - not quite sure what you would do with them other then looking on a computer.

This camera is highly impressive in this regard. I set it to EXR Auto mode on the mode dial (make sure you turn on the Advanced Anti-Blur feature under the F button menu), and let my mom shot this camera for 2 days under various condition.

But I wanted to get a compact pocket camera that had a high zoom, high resolution (megapixels and screen), high speed & HD 1080p video, and that, well, looked sharp. I started studying cameras back in January, and weighed all my options carefully... even had a bent to give up and just get an SLR, but I wanted a pocket camera for cruising around, and the F550 EXR kept coming up as having the highest potential of the new \"travel zooms\", and I gave in and got one. I wasn't expecting crystal clear professional pictures from this. It is not an SLR camera, and it does not behave like one. I mean come on, some of the reviews here expected this camera to cook their breakfast for them.That said, this camera does take great pictures, if you take the time to fully read the manual, get to know it, and experiment. It was a joy to get to know. I had a few issues with battery life at first, until 1) I \"broke in\" my battery by having to recharge it a few times, and 2) getting the firmware update to version 1.10 on the Fujifilm website support page. Now, battery life lasts for 300-400 pictures! Coolness. Also, there is a mild issue with the camera focus hunting while shooting video. Still, to me, the video is awesome. Audio is shot in stereo too and sounds great. Shot some video playing my drumset and it was crystal clear. Guess I'm just used to \"old\" video cameras or something. Looking at the video on my 52\" flat screen TV, it's just incredible. Crisp, sharp, and very little out of focus frames.Unlike some other reviewers, I think the menu system and navigation is crystal clear, and easy to get to where you are going. Maybe the first time you use it you can't find everything, but this isn't rocket science. I can be anywhere in any menu within 3-5 seconds of pressing the menu button with the rotating mode dial, which is freaking awesome for menu navigation.The 3\" 460k res screen looks great, and the camera itself looks really sharp. Build is very solid... it isn't any bigger than I thought it would be, but it is a little heavier. The 15x zoom is sweet, and pictures taken at full zoom are clear with the anti-shake system in the camera. Speaking of shake, there is an \"advanced antiblur\" setting in EXR mode which really helps sharpen the details and reduce noise. Also love the \"silent mode\" which can turned on in 2 seconds so that the flash and camera noise is turned off for discretion. Too cool. The ability to shoot in RAW is a great thing to have for a compact non-SLR camera too. The 360 degree panorama mode is very cool.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, but then again I think I had reasonable expectations for the camera. This is not a professional camera, but, I do believe this is a good camera for professionals to potentially have as their fun \"messing around\" camera, and definitely good enough for amateurs such as myself for their main camera.

Johe \"RSJ\"", "ReviewID": "R27MEJORPCL3FR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was waiting for this camera to come out because it claimed a revolutionary CMOS sensor with improved image quality and usable 1080p video, all in a small form factor. Sadly I have to report that it delivers on none of these promises. Specific gripes:1) Although the 15x lens is wonderful, the focus hunting (when set to center focus, continuous focus is even worse) in movie mode is absolutely terrible. The camera doesn't \"lock on\" to something in the center, which it should. If you zoom in or out, the view goes completely out of focus and takes a long time to get back in focus. There is no manual focus option, which would of course solve most of the problem. This would have been easy to incorporate as the rear command dial can be rotated. The focus problem essentially makes this camera useless for most movie shooting. A more minor problem is that the take-a-photo-while-shooting-a-movie feature is also useless, as it introduces a significant studder into your movie. The 320fps feature is interesting, but requires a LOT of light for the movie not to look underexposed. All the novel features are significantly handicapped by these issues.2) The image quality is poor. Even when the camera bins pixels, the resulting 8 MP images look significantly \"smudged\" at 1:1. The noise in images is fairly obvious, but certainly not any worse than other P&S; cameras. Nevertheless as the camera is advertised as sporting a \"revolutionary\" CMOS sensor, I have to disagree and state unequivocally that this sensor is just as crappy as others when compared to even the most basic digital SLR models.3) The battery life is severely limited. I haven't tried yet, but I would bet the camera would shut off before the 29 minute movie length limit is reached. They really needed to use a physically larger battery to power this camera as the in-camera processing seems to use a lot of power. The camera quit working after maybe 100 pictures and a few very short movies.4) The manual modes offer limited usefulness as there are only 3 F stops in the camera (at 24mm): F3.5, F7.1,  and F10. F7.1 and F10 generally provide very large DOF but F3.5 can be lacking when shallow DOF is required.

I took about 1400 photos of which I'm keeping about 1200.  Overall I can say that I really like this camera, especially for low-light situations.  I took many photos in dark cathedrals using the pro-low light mode and most of the pictures came out very sharp, something I could never do with any other digital camera I owned (and I've owned many!).  Of course there is some noise at high ISO but it's not too bad.  Usually I would limit the ISO to 400, and I could still get good very low-light photos. I love the 15x zoom; the digital zoom works pretty well too.Negatives:  the flash is very weak.  In backlit photos where I wanted to use the flash to brighten up faces, it didn't work well.  One needed to get very close to the subject, like 3 feet, for the flash to help.  The EXR-dynamic range function didn't seem to make any difference in high-contrast light situations.  The video was fairly useless in a moderate light situation.The battery worked fine for me.  I charged the battery almost every evening (I also brought a spare) and could take a few hundred photos before having to replace it.

First of all, it lacks any good grip curves and it is slippery (meanwhile, it is rather heavy for its size). Secondly, they designed this pop-up flash that is completely automatic and you cannot make it not to pop up every time you power camera up. And the spot where the flash pops up is where you really want to keep your left hand index finger.Even after you update this camera's firmware, the device still goes through batteries like crazy. One day of intermittent shooting could mean up to THREE battery changes. Keeping the GPS on all the time kills the batteries even quicker.The video shooting mode has some atrocious auto-focus problems. The camera cannot keep up with any moving objects, so they keep being shot out of focus.Also, the wide-angle mode (no zoom) causes some pretty bad fish-eye like results, so if you have to shoot a portrait, you need to step back a little (if you can) and use a bit of zoom - like 2-3x.On the bright side, this camera has wonderful sensor mode settings, great low-light performance, it is rather fast and has tons of zoom power.

Use DR400, M size (8MP) for best results.The settings take a while to master, but shoot a whole bunch of pictures on different settings and you'll work it out.No small CMOS sensor camera will match the larger sized sensors, but I think this camera probably compares favorably to other P&S; cameras.Video quality would be great if it didn't continually hunt for for focus.

I'm basically a novice regarding photography--I need a point and shoot that really is as simple as just pointing and shooting, and this camera delivers with outstanding results.  I have never been so impressed with a pocket camera.I own one of the predecessors to this camera, the F70EXR, and I hated it....sometimes it took terrific photos but just as often they were out of focus and blurry.  It was complicated to figure out the myriad of settings, and after weeks of trying to figure it out, I gave up and used my casio FC100 instead (another great little camera, especially for high speed).I mulled over at length whether to take a chance on the F550EXR.  From what I had read in the pre-release reviews, it should be the best thing next to sliced bread---it was supposed to be a big improvement over the F70exr and F200EXR, but when the F70EXR first came out, it had rave pre-release reviews.  After much contemplation, I finally bit the bullet and bought it through Amazon--I figured I could always return it.  Thankfully, return is not going to be necessary.  This little camera rocks!Like I said, I need a point and shoot that is just that simple, and the F550 fills the bill.  I put it on AutoEXR mode, I point, push halfway to focus, which it does almost instantaneously, and then I shoot--the entire process takes less than a second, and the camera automatically picks the correct scene mode and gives terrific photos that are always in focus, have great colors, and, I don't know how else to describe it--they simply look terrific.This camera is truly amazing at automatically picking the correct scene/settings in EXR Auto mode.  Extreme closeups--no problem--details are amazing--the photos are crisp and clear.  Sunsets...again...no problem...it adjusts accordingly and gives terrific results.  Same for scenery and portraits.Speed of focus and operation is excellent, except in extreme low light situation--and by this I mean almost dark.  My Casio FC100 (and the new Casio Ex-ZR100) take better shots in virtually dark situations--quite amazing in that respect, but for every other low light situation, the Fuji is by far the superior camera.  It fires up in about 2 seconds, it focuses in less than one second, and is ready to go right away with the next shot.  Low light shots are very impressive--I doubt you will use the flash much with this camera.The zoom is likewise impressive.  With 15x optical zoom, I was expecting some blurriness with full zoom for hand-held shots.  Much to my surprise, every hand-held shot I've taken at full zoom are crystal clear, even though I can see my hands shaking when I take the shot.  The anti-shake program is incredible, and now I'm spoiled and don't know how I ever lived without the 15x zoom.  Its very useful.About the only complaint I have is the performance in continuous mode...its very confusing to set up...basically, you can pick the speed for continuous mode to anything between 3 frames per second up to 11 frames per second.  It does not, however, save all of the shots that you take--you can set it up to save only the last 4, you can have it pick the best one, or you can set it up to take only 4...I still haven't really figured this part out.  My Casio is much better in this regard.  It would be nice to have a continuous mode where it would take 1-11 photos per second and then just keep on snapping until you stop or the sd card is full, and save all of them so you can go through them to determine which ones you want to keep.  For all I know, it does have this functionality buried somewhere in the controls, and I just haven't figured it out.  In any event, the continuous mode is not likely to be used much by stubborm and impatient people like me who don't like reading instructions--although I must admit, in this case I did try to read the instructions, and I still couldn't figure out just what the camera will do for you and/or how to properly configure the continuous modes.Oh, lest I forget, the movie mode is also terrific--it records audio in stereo, and movies in full 1080p if you like.  The movie mode has a dedicated button on the back panel so its very easy to start recording...just press the movie button and you're Steven Spielberg..takes less than 1 second to switch to recording in movie mode.  You can also snap a photo within the movie playback if you like and it will save separate and apart from the movie file.  A big plus is that the optical zoom works during movie mode--not many pocket cams do this.  Unfortunately, the shot goes out of focus during the actual zoom operation, but then immediately re-focuses again when the zoom is stopped.  It would be nice if it stayed in focus during the entire operation, but re-focusing at all is better than what you get with most point and shoots.Battery life is very good--not as good as my Casios, but good enough that I can easily take 200 to 300 photos and still have some juice.  I read that there is a firmware upgrade you can do that bumps battery life up to over 400 shots if you're not using flash, but I  haven't tried it yet.The flash works very well, but you will rarely, if ever, need to use it.  As noted above, this camera does very well in low light.One last little quibble--the camera is a bit thick--and a bit long.  It will fit in your jeans, but its a tight fit--just a small reduction in size would make it much more comfortable.  But this is minor--overall, the camera is the best point and shoot I've ever had--it truly is amazing.I did not review the GPS function, because I've never used it, and I have no desire to even try it.  I think most people will be like me--they know where they are when they take the photo.  The GPS function is a geeky function that is cool because it will do what it does--e.g. tell you the coordinates of where the shot was taken, but not likely to be of much use to most people.  The GPS also stores over 400,000 known landmarks, so you can turn it on and see if you are close to a landmark, a museum, auditorium, etc, but it takes a few minutes to start up.  You can leave it on to avoid the startup time, but then it is a constant drain on your battery--not worth it in my opinion.  This camera's sibling, the F500, comes without the GPS, but the continuous mode on the 500 is a tad bit slower and it doesn't shoot in RAW (see below re RAW).  The 550 is only $20 more, so I figured I might as well spring for the (The F550 has the capability to shoot in RAW mode, which is supposed to be a big deal, but just being a ham and egger type user, I have no idea what that is and I doubt I will ever try to find out--from what I have read though, this is a big deal to the more knowledgeable camera users out there).In summary, I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I am so happy that I took a chance and ordered it.  When I point and shoot, I get great photos, every time. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to other ham and egger type photographers out there. Those of you who are more sophisticated might find some areas in which to quibble, but my guess is that even the camera buffs will for the most part be happy with this amazing little machine.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Dery", "ReviewID": "RUVVEDEAVEVZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Too bad when you have it zoomed out it takes in the picture the shadow of the zoom apparatus.

Good to excellent picture quality, good build quality.  Always recommended Fuji to friends.  But, we went with another camera brand last go-around, and results were mixed.  Decent, but there was always something that was a little off.  So I decided this time, we'd try Fuji again.I should have thought about it a bit more.The camera feels solid, and after taking some pictures, they came out fairly good.  But action shots using the EXR setting were mixed - half were blurry.  It may be more of me needing to play around with the settings more, but I really didn't have much opportunity.Why?  Because trying to turn on the camera a day after charging the battery (and not even using the camera), the battery was dead.It seems there is a flaw in the camera that drains the battery, if you do a proper web search.  I upgraded the firmware, as many said this fixed their problem.  No dice.  So Fuji warranty wants me to send them the camera - on my dime.  Meanwhile, I have no camera to use, and it disappears into the black hole of Fuji's horrible customer service.  Finding out who to contact and how was an exercise in madness, and I consider myself tech and web savvy.Other issues;What ever happen to docking stations to charge your camera and upload?  Just a general comment, but seriously.  Two main issues with the EXR here;1. The battery takes FOREVER to charge.  Hours. What ever happened to rapid chargers?  Plus, removing the battery and putting it in a dedicated charger is a pain in the butt.  Seriously.  Yes, removable battery is a MUST.  But that doesn't mean that you MUST remove the battery.2. The link input for the USB cable on the EXR is inconvenient.  Where it is situated is hard to get the cable maneuvered, and the door doesn't open quite far enough, so you think you're going to break the door to get the mini USB plugged in.  PLUS, the mini USB is an old style mini.  I don't know about other brands coming out right now, but I know my PlaySport has the newer mini USB design.  Standardization - so if I lose this cable, no dice in leveraging my androids/Kindle/Blackberry/Playsport/every other piece of equipment other than Apple that uses the same exact cord.My point being - if there was a docking station, I wouldn't have to worry about this, except when traveling - which is when you expect to have to deal with minor inconveniences.  But when you deal with a minor inconvenience every single day, then it isn't so minor anymore.Operation;I hate, hate, hate the pop-up flash.  My finger is always there on the camera when I turn it on.The zoom works fairly well.  I'm worried about the swivel breaking eventually, though it is a convenient spot on the shutter release.  But it's not a huge difference from the typical see-saw toggles of many other cameras.Documentation is horrid.  What each function will do and its effect is a mystery. EXR mode I assume evaluates the shooting situation and makes the setting it finds appropriate.  But I've had it take multiple photos for a composite shot, then the next instance take a regular shot without flash, and then take one with flash.  All standing in the same place, pointing at the same subject with minimal change in the environment.Geo-tagging - not sure how well this works.  It seemed to have trouble finding my location many times, and not sure if I need to use the Fuji software in order to keep the geo-tagging with the picture.  Since the software crashed my computer, and I haven't been able to take all that money photos due to the battery issues.It's in the mail as we speak back to Edison, NJ for warranty replacement/repair.

I'm rating this model an OK, but I don't think I would buy another Fujifilm product. I would have been better off with a waterproof/weatherproof camera (see Canon) at half the price.ConsBattery life: Wow! This is the biggest disappointment for me. I would fully charge the battery and it would be dead within a day. If I hadn't purchased a backup, I would have lost a lot of vacation memories. Maybe the trick is to take the battery out of the camera after every use?Access to Battery: The sliding closer is a pain to use. I can't get a good enough grip on it and even then I have to push down pretty hard before it slides open. Because of the positioning, half the time I power up the camera as i'm holding it.Markings on selection wheel: Make sure you don't have any lotions on your hand when spinning the image/exposure selection wheel. I had suntan lotion on (vacation) and after a couple days, the markings blurred and rubbed right off. Now I have to look a the display, though that's not a huge inconvenience.Lens cover: Like most point'n'shoots, the lens covers are sensitive to dirt, sand and other particles. I had to carry a q-tip in the camera bag and power off, then back on a couple times because the lens wouldn't open all the way.Pros:Panorama feature: Great option and I use it often.Picture Quality: Overall, very good.Video: Does well for short videos, though you have to keep very still or it'll be blurry.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera at an excellent price", "Author": "Microbe", "ReviewID": "RII1DZZYX4VMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I notice that these are now unavailable...maybe we got ours at 50% RRP because they were runout, but we're glad we bought it.

I will only write about cons. When you have to shoot inside, firing in all modes (AF, S, AUTO, with high ISO, etc.), the quality is not good enough according to my expectations, specially when I compare to the CANON dSLR.

I had it on my wish list, it was inexpensive and offered a wide variety of features. And heck, it's just so stinkin' cute!Anyway, I took it out today for a test. We went to Cabelas Sporting Goods and I photographed the fish in the aquarium and the various dioramas. The lighting in Cabelas is very tricky-spot lighting for the various products, florescent lighting for the store, huge natural light windows and racks and racks of clothing to absorb and block light. Very challenging for a little point and shoot. Anyway, I set the camera for full auto, but not EXR. It handled everything almost flawlessly. The stuffed amimals in the dioramas looked almost lifelike and the details like fur and natural grooves in their hooves and antlers came out very well. The swimming fish also looked quite good, although dead on shots were a problem, since the flash would bounce off the glass aquariums. I got better shots shooting at a slight angle. I fired off shot after shot after shot and the battery held up just fine. (I have the GPS turned off) However, I have to agree with other reviews that are critical of the video feature. Mine was choppy and unpleasant to watch. Video seems to be a problem with this camera. (thus four stars instead of five)Holding the camera is easy, but you do have to watch out for the automatic flash popping up. Personally, I didn't find this a problem and I think the camera is ergonomic to hold. However, I do have small hands. Folks with normal sized adult hands might encounter some issues. I also found the size of the camera to be good. It fit easily into a jeans pocket and in my purse, it's light and convenient.Tethering this to a camera for picture transfer is irritating, since it requires a micro cable. I have adaptors and the camera comes with a cable but it's still a bit annoying. However, the pictures you will get will be sharp and clear.Altogether, I really like my little Fuji.

I am used to holding it steady with use of the F31 without stabilization.  I hold this the same way and find it's no better.  I tried both image stabilization modes and there was no improvement.

It's pretty good in confined spaces. I appreciate the wide angle. And the telephoto zoom gets me in close to wild animals in the countryside.  I'm still learning about the possibilities of the F550EXR. For the time being I haven't activated the GPS feature, but I'm ready with a spare battery! I don't use its video capabilities.  Overall I'm extremely happy with the quality of the photos - which I guess is normal with a 16 megapixel camera. I would recommend this camera without hesitation - unless you want to slip it into your shirt pocket, in which case you'll find it a bit thick.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "dissapointed", "Author": "kj \"chicagomom\"", "ReviewID": "R3F6SFL4DHY8Z6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok so I was so so excited when I preordered this camera.  Finally everything I needed all in one.  Actually I think the gps is a waist of money, but I wanted to be able to shoot raw format wo investing in a dslr.  So I had no charge but to order the 550 model instead of 500 model.cons:1)  very heavy for a point & shoot, alas due to good solid body construction2)  auto modes are garbage, it would say I was in focus but then I would load it on my computer and it was more like soft focus.  I like sharp crisp images on my pics.3)  indoor photos about half of 60 shots were what I considered ok, but none by far were better than my 6mp kodak.pros:1) good HDR setting2) excellent excellent outdoor shots even in auto mode.3) you can choose coloring also, like sepia, bw, vivid, or standard color.  Vivid with the greens of grass can be a little fake, but I love color saturation4) the zoom when all the way out makes it impossible to hold camera still, but the stabilizer works great with helping your shot come out decent.5) Raw format capability6) Background defocus option, I love this setting, and the next camera I buy will definately have it.If the indoor focusing and auto modes were better this would have been the perfect camera!  I am so dissapointed.  I sent it back for a full refund!recently bought the sony wx9, will write review soon look for it.  It performs better than this camera indoors w low light situations, but auto modes also are not all their cracked up to be.  Is it to much to ask camera makers for you to go back to 4 years ago and put your auto modes back with all the new bells & whistles of the new gen cameras!!  I just don't understand why that is so hard to provide your customers!!", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better Then others in class", "Author": "D.

If you use Raw file format then that should be a lot better. I used the raw and jpeg option so that I can have both ready to go. the controls are a bit compact but I think it works. Over all this is a good buy to have for a point and shoot. I think a lot of people think this will replace the DSLR and that is no the case this is a point and shoot! DSLR has manual focus can Aperture settings and so on. I got what i paid for and am not unhappy with the purchase. my only gripe which is small would be that the camera doesn't come with a memory card usually you get one with the point and shoot cameras but I guess to lower the price that omit it.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "High hopes, disaster in realiy", "Author": "marreino \"marreino\"", "ReviewID": "R30VYX5HRL5FML", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take hiking in Peru.  It seemed perfect on my practice hikes in Calif.  When I got to the Amazon of Peru the camera shut off and would not turn on.

I read the news of the new round of \"travel zooms\" and counted the days till they came out. I even didn't buy the lumix tz10 because the reviews said bad picture quality....kind of the point, right?So, my number one expectation is that what I see on the screen is what the picture will look like later. Maybe I'm asking too much?? My second expectation is that I'll be able to do some focus work - blur the background, blur the foreground, etc.  I don't use many effects, I don't do much editing. I want good, solid pictures - and video.I've had the camera for 2 days now and have taken a couple hundred pictures. I've only been pleased with 10 - 20.  The others have been washed out, blurry in areas, flat and boring. I don't know the technical terms for these, but I wouldn't put them in a picture album. So, at a base level, I'm frustrated with this camera.But. I do realize it could be operator error. So, I'm trying to be patient and dig into the settings and give the camera every chance. But I can't help but ask...why do I have to \"give it a chance\"?  Why doesn't it just work?I've only used the video a little bit, but it kept trying to find the focus instead of focusing when doing any zoom, so I need to test it more and see if it keeps happening.  The video I did look at on the computer was jumpy. I used whatever the settings were from the factory.Oh. and I HATE the software. As far as I can tell, I can't pick which pictures I want to pull from the camera - let's say I took several \"groups\" of pictures over a couple of days. I usually like to pull the pictures from the camera in those specific groups so I can name them appropriately. The software only allows you to pull ALL pictures on the camera. And the viewer is just annoying. I want to arrow through the pictures one by one to see what came out. The viewer only let's you click to the next one of the photos in each row, so you have to go back to the big view to go to the next row, look at those pics, go back to the big view, go to the next row, etc. It makes no sense.I'm going to keep trying.
