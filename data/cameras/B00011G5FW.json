{"Reviews": [{"Title": "exactly what I was looking for", "Author": "Jim Hammond", "ReviewID": "RJR6RSPU0K4ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I have much experience with cameras, camcorders, and digital images, I have never owned a digital camera before. My main camera has been a Nikon 6006 SLR, so I am pretty picky about quality.After extensive research, I settled on the DSC-T1. It is exactly what I expected, and almost exactly what I wanted, but allow me to elaborate because it may not be exactly what YOU want.I was tempted by larger digital cameras (and I will eventually get one of those too). For example, the Panasonic Lumix is few bucks cheaper and has more controls, a BIG lens, great image stabilization, and 12x optical zoom (digital zoom is meaningless). It is even possible to get a medium size 5MP digital camera with 5x optical zoom and better pictures than the dsc-t1 for much less. However, I concluded that I would rather have a good camera with me 24x7 than leave a great camera in the car or at home. I was SO right. I have already captured SO many photos I would have missed. I carry the camera at all times in one of those silk bags that come with Oakley sunglasses.I considered other small cameras like the Casio Elixim Z4, but it does not have video in US versions. The Canon S400 is very good, but it is slower and thicker with a much smaller LCD, and a newer version is coming out April 30th. No ultra compact that is clearly better than the DSC-T1 is on the horizon.In addition to ultra compact size, I wanted at least 4MP, at least 3x optical zoom, quality video ability, speed, ease of use, and flexible shooting modes. This camera has 5MP, 3x optical zoom, excellent 640x480 video mode, speed, ease of use, and shooting modes flexible enough to accommodate everything from action to night images.Video is in MPG files, which can be played back on the free Real Player. It is not possible to zoom while shooting video, but it is possible to zoom before recording begins or when recording has been paused.I haven't tried the software that comes with it yet. I run Windows XP, and I just place the dsc-t1 in the cradle, turn it on, and it appears as another disk drive in Windows Explorer. I can copy files from it and paste them onto a hard drive. I can then delete the image files from the camera to free up the space on the memory stick just as if I were deleting files from any Windows folder.Apparently slowness is a problem with all digital cameras except for a few of the most recent ones, and the DSC-T1 seems fast to me. This may be the result of the newer and faster Duo Pro Memory Stick technology. Get the 256MB Duo Pro Memory Stick. The 512MB stick costs three times as much. Don't bother with a spare battery. They are too expensive, and the battery life is OK. You don't want to be frequently opening the delicate little battery/memory doors on digital cameras anyway.Don't worry about having no optical view finder. They just make cameras bigger. The 2.5 inch LCD is bigger than any other digital camera and is quite sufficient.Such a small camera is a little tricky to hold SECURELY without getting in the way of the lens, so if you tend to drop things, then you WILL eventually drop this unless you use the wrist strap at all times, which partially defeats the convenience aspect. I still haven't attached the wrist strap because I am extra careful, but someone could still bump into me while shooting. On the other hand, I don't want to overstate this problem because the camera is quite durable/graspable when the lens cover is closed.Almost every indoor picture with the kids has at least a hint of red eye. I consider about 60% of them to have too much, but I still get more quality shots than I have time to email, so I really can't complain. BTW, 5MP jpeg files are about 2MB each, which makes email a challenge. Less than one out of ten indoor pictures seems grainy. It is actually possible to take decent pictures in total darkness when using the flash because the auto focus works in the dark, which is not true for every camera.It is possible to use one of the modes that forces the camera to 100 speed to guarantee maximum resolution (0% graininess), but you may have to brace the camera well for the slow shutter speeds that result. In fact I took some good pictures from my front porch at NIGHT by bracing the camera, but this will take more practice. Note that such pictures did not use a flash because a flash is useless beyond a few yards away, and only works WELL up to 6 feet away.One pleasant surprise was the excellent sound quality. I carried a digital voice recorder 24x7, which would fill up until I had time to manually transpose my notes and delete them forever to free up memory on the recorder again. Before that I used the very expensive little Pearlcorder L400. It was less convenient to transpose from a tape, but at least I could keep the tapes forever. Sound quality on all of them was poor. Whereas, with the DSC-T1, I discovered I could take hours of VIDEO notes in 160x160 mode with perfect sound quality and then just copy these files onto my hard drive to keep forever. This is when I knew I was keeping the DSC-T1.", "Date": "March 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "A good camera once the settings are fixed", "Author": "catman \"bobtmigo\"", "ReviewID": "RG7R8SB7NGI8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As many people have noticed, this camera does not take good pictures out of the box. But if you spend a little time taking test shots and playing with the many controls, it can produce stellar results. With mine, I found that by setting it to Program mode (instead of Auto), setting the exposure to -0.3 EV, and the speed to ISO 100, I get consistently excellent results - not quite as good as bulky cameras costing twice as much, but impressive for something as small as this. Thankfully the camera remembers these settings between uses, so the adjustment only needs to be done once. Since then the camera has been a constant companion and lives in my pocket all the time (the lens cover has never once opened accidentally, perhaps because I slide it into my pocket endwise). The vulnerable controls and LCD on the back of the camera are protected by my PDA, which lives in the same pocket.Also, don't be afraid to change the flash power setting. This can make a huge difference when you're taking a closeup of Tiddles or shotting your daughter's birthday party. (Sony - why isn't the flash power automatically coupled to the focus distance?)Instead of Sony's expensive accessories, I bought a cheap PCMCIA memory stick adapter that lives permanently inside my laptop. That means I only have to take the power adapter when I go travelling. The ludicrous docking station and USB cable stay home.The camera needs more memory. The supplied 32MB isn't nearly enough; I immediately upgraded to 256MB, which is more than I'll ever need.But the single biggest drawback is NO TRIPOD MOUNT. Big mistake, Sony.To anyone who uses Photoshop to correct the colour balance or other defects: learn to use your camera! There's a menu setting for this. Play with it and do some test shots. Put a little effort in now and save a lot of time later.At the end of it all, it's a great camera, incredibly versatile and capable of high-quality results, but with some serious but (mostly) easily-corrected defects. Most people aren't going to spend the time making test shots and calibrating the camera, which is a shame because it's necessary if you're going to take good pictures. Sony should not have released this camera in this condition, and I hope they get it right next time - if they do, they'll have a real killer on their hands. Even so, I'd still strongly recommend this camera to anyone who's willing to put the effort in and who (like me) doesn't have the option of waiting for the next version.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "SONY's T1 is an Excellent Compact Digital Camera", "Author": "James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"", "ReviewID": "R1BGZ5A6VR0KPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Comments: Testing this SONY DSC-T1 during February 2004, has been a pleasure, carrying it in my pocket all day, every day. The size and weight is ideal for ultimate portability. Using this 5M pixel camera at 3M pixel resolution, using the smart zoom feature, or 5 MP mode produces excellent results. The T1 also allows in-camera cropping of images, and in-camera image resizing for e-mail purposes. The high quality movie mode is comparable to high quality digital-video tape camcorders, 30 frames per second at 640x480 pixel size image, with the exception of typical camcorder better optical zoom capability. The camera also allows one to view and edit-out portions of the video. The image quality is stunning, and color quality and saturation is also spectacular. HQ (fine) video where 3 minutes fills 256MB card, however, the video is movie quality with very smooth moving objects, in great color definition. Quite a bonus for a digital still image camera. SONY has definitely placed a great deal of engineering muscle into this device. I have produced a number of 8x10\" photos and am stunned at the color and image detail. The trick in any photography activity is knowing how to take good pictures and finding correct lighting, etc. Taking care of business, when framing the image, and setting the camera features, will produce truly great results. \"The camera that one can take everywhere is the best camera to have,\" is the remark I deliver to my students, and this device does not disappoint. Spend a few minutes, try 60 minutes, reviewing the 100 page instruction book, buy several high speed 256MB memory cards, and have a great time capturing images every place you go throughout the day. As to a Camera Rating, it has earned a solid A+. FYI, I also shoot action sports events for FAU, NCAA Atlantic Sun Conference, and others using Canon's best digital equipment. Therefore, when I do not desire to carry large Digital 35mm size equipment, SONY's T1 is an ideal companion.Regarding SONY's DSC-T1's low-light operation in the still-image and movie modes, this camera as many that have a maximum aperture of f3.5 coupled with maximum ISO level of 400, will experience image blur if care is not taken at exposure. In using this camera extensively in many lighting situations, one would have to sacrifice low light sensitivity in exchange for extreme portability. In movie mode and still photography, in dim lighting, extreme care must be taken at exposure to prevent image blur. When in very-low-light environments where the design limits of the imager peak at 400 ISO, image noise may become unacceptable, when compared to larger SLR cameras like Canon's EOS-10D which performs quite well at ISO 800 at long exposures. The trade-off is size and weight of the equipment. For flash photography, the T1 operates quite well for small group shots where camera-to-subject distances are within 4-6 feet, which is within its design limits. The tiny built-in flash will not be able to create enough (flash) light for large groups with low-available-light conditions, where the camera is 3 or more meters, or 10 or more feet from the subject. As to red-eye reduction, the mechanism is for the camera to emit short flash-bursts prior to the actual image capture, in effort to close the iris's of the subject when the main flash and exposure occurs. All human conditions do not operate so regularly, where perhaps the subject's iris' did not close sufficiently to prevent the main-flash's reflection from the subject's retina. We have not experienced an unusual level of red-eye problems, however, occasionally it can occur, particularly if the subject's iris does not react to the pre-flash light.ProblemsOne issue to be careful about is the placement of the right most button which activates the close-up feature. One's thumb may accidentally press this right-arrow button when holding the camera, when close-ups are not intended. So look on the LCD panel often at the lower left corner to see the Flower symbol. If shown, you're in close-up mode. Simply press the right-arrow button again to turn-off close-up mode. My only complaint is SONY's insistence on using obscure, proprietary, expensive, memory cards. In this case the \"Memory Stick Duo Pro.\" SONY may have been better served had it chosen an industry standard SD card which is now available in 1 GB sizes. However, SONY says that with the DSC-T1 set in high quality FINE video mode, SONY's card is necessary because of its theoretical 20 MB per second transfer speed; presently that speed is unavailable by other SD card manufacturers. And after you see what this high quality FINE mode looks like, you too will be a SONY believer. As one may notice, even with a few complaints, I'm quite enthusiastic with the results.James L Wilson Professor,Principles.of.Digital.Photography and Post.Image.Processing Florida.Atlantic.University Boca.Raton.Campus Operating.Entity.BocaDigital.LLC.

All of the professional reviewers said it took great pictures. The amature reviewers were a mixed lot, with some claiming it took poor pictures. I decided to go with the pros and purchase this item.I'm glad I did. First, it does take great pictures IF YOU READ THE MANUAL. Red Eye reduction is turned OFF by default, you have to turn it ON to get rid of red eye. The flash has 3 settings, and it is in the MIDDLE one by default. Turn up the flash to HIGH and it works great indoors. Hold the camera STEADY when you take the picture, regardless of light conditions, and you'll get very sharp photos. Memory Stick Pro Duo cards aren't that expensive, especially if you buy the Lexmar ones, and the price just was cut by Sony. The charger is very compact, and unless you plan on taking more than 180 photos on your trip, you don't even need to bring it with you. The view screen is very viewable at night, if you change the default NORMAL setting to HIGH. Finally, the complaint about the tripod is absurd: please don't tell you bought the smallest camera on the market so you can use a tripod to take photos: get a larger camera and use this for what it is designed for. A tripod with this is like using a sports car to pull a trailer. If you insist on a tripod mount, get the active sleeve case from Sony ($25 on Amazon), which adds a tripod mount to the camera.Pros: Crisp, sharp photos. Very compact design (size of a deck of cards). Bright, sharp, large view screen. Solid construction. Good manual.Cons: Expensive, but worth it.

The camera's features compared to it's size are incredible.Sony engineers truly are the masters at miniturization that's for sure.I also found the site \"[...] that had a excellent review and great,large pics.The site also has alot of good articles about new technology and gadgets but I digress.  Let's get down to the nitty gritty about the T-1.I will start off exploring the camera's only three flaws in my opinion.That's the \"red-eye\" reduction,flash and the lack of some sort of lock for the slide down lens cover.You can accidentally open the cover(and subsequently start up the camera) and expose the lens to debris,etc.The other problem was the \"red-eye\" reduction.Bottom line it's just not up to snuff for the camera.The flash is also a little weak.Besides those three annoying,yet totally easy to live with things,the camera is a winner.Oh,one more little annoyance.In order to take video @ 30fps,you need the top of the line $300 512MB Memory Stick Pro Duo stick.Ouch! expensive,but I think worth it given the camera's cool factor and if you can afford it.  Now the good stuff about the T-1.One:It's size!It's barely bigger than a box of Altoids!Two:The HUGE 2.5\" screen.It's the same quality screen that you see on PDA's.It has absolutely no glare in direct sunlight.Three:Shutter time.The shutter is BLAZINGLY fast!

I had read ALL the review posted here and was a bit nervous about some of the concerns that have been mentioned.  The balance of positive reviews convinced me to give it a try and I am VERY happy I did. This is my 3rd digital camera so far, canon powershot, nikon coolpix and now the sony. The Sony is my favorite already!I took the camera to Las Vegas for a party weekend to try it out. My real concern with the camera was blurry images. The camera is VERY small and I worried that I would not be able to hold it still while shooting and get a lot of motion blur in pics. I didn't get a SINGLE blurry image all weekend.  It shot crystal clear shots consistently and under all conditions. I shot while dancing, running... all ways and never had an issue! You just have to find a comfortable way to hold the camera.The lens is easy to drop your finger in front of... but if you pay attention to what you are doing, this doesn't need to be a problem.The GIANT LCD display is probably my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE thing about this camera!!  It is SO clear and BIG!! You can see GREAT detail in every photo with it!  Serious PROPS on the designer of that element!I read complaints about the flash on it.  First, the color of the flash is GREAT!  I know of several digitals that when  you shoot semi-close, they turn everything yellow. This one is perfect.  There are settings for the strength of the flash as well that you can adjust.  It isn't ANY weaker than any other digital camera on the market!  You cannot expect to shoot super far away with the tiny flash that you get on a point and shoot digital. It is sufficient in strength for what the camera is intended for.  And, if you read the manual you will learn that there are wasy to change the metering of the camera for shooting far away in lower light situtations. Like any other electronic item you should spend a little time familiarizing yourself with all the settings before complaining about something you simply have not taken the time to understand.Red eye setting on camera works great as well!!  Not sure why others are having trouble with that. Maybe they have just not figured out how to turn the setting to ON.The interactive menu is really easy to figure out and work.  The pre-programmed settings are vast and very cool.  They have a setting for almost any codition and the AUTO program worked perfectly for all different lighting conditions.It has a very sturdy casing which is perfect for me...  Feels like it will stand the test of time. I had a problem with my Nikon Coolpix because the casing was such lightweight plastic and after a week had to tape battery door closed.  Very cheap and flimsy materials used on it.. but The sony FEELS very sturdy!The drop down lens cover is perfect. It drops and BAM, ready to shoot. Looking at the product photo's on Amazon of this camera you can't really tell how it works. I almost thought that it didn't have a lens cover and was very relieved when it arrived and found it does.I recommed the largest memory card you can afford for this baby!  5mp will fill a card in NO time.  Of course you don't have to shoot that big and get more on the card but it is great to have the option! Why buy a 5mp unless you are going to shoot em! ;)All in all I am REALLY pleased with this camera.  No challenge to speak of for me!

I love the size of the LCD, write speed and video capabilities.  There are two problems with this camera that I wanted to share just so everyone can make an informed decision.1) The LCD is impossible to see in dimly light setting, even with the background set to high. (i.e., bars, natural formations like caves, some unlit tourist sites at dusk) The only way to make out what you're shooting is to switch into night mode.  The problem here is that night mode with blur your picture without a tripod as the shutter is held open longer to bring in more light.  I ran into this problem over and over again and it was one of two times I ever cared that the camera doesn't have an optical viewfinder.2) While the huge LCD screen is wonderful for taking pictures, understand it is vulnerability for the camera.  While I was traveling in China, my LCD screen was damaged, rendering my camera 100% useless.  The cases Sony sells are crap, they do not actually protect the camera as none of them are a true hard case.  I mention how easily the screen can be damaged because Sony charges $450 to **TRY** to repair the LCD screen.  That is roughly the same cost as buying a new camera.  I have yet to find a private dealer that can or will repair it and believe me, I've looked.Basically, if you intend to do extensive traveling, this camera is a liability.  Without a viewfinder you have no backup plan and my find yourself as I did, in a beautiful foreign place with a non-functioning camera and no means to replace it.  If you are getting this to take out with your friends when you go out at night, again, opt of a camera with a viewfinder.  You cannot see the LCD in the dark.

The first thing I did was place a call to my geekiest friend who I knew I would recieve good advice from.  Knowing what I was looking for in a camera he instantly suggested the sony dsc t1.  I began to read approx. 150 reviews only to become very confused by all the horrible reviews I was reading.  I called my buddy back to ask what he thought about this and he told me to STOP reading user reviews, because most people who write a review never have anything good to say and he suggested i check out steves digcam online for a very thorough and informed review.  I did this and found that the camera got quite a wonderful review on this site, and I figured if I read anymore I wouldn't end up with a camera...just a headache!

Is extremely easy to use, and like you'll read in most of the good reviews of this camera, the suggestion to READ THE MANUAL, is very beneficial.  All the naysayers out there seem to me, to have no idea how to use this camera, because I can't believe all the complaints people seem to have, with blur, and red eye, and blah blah blah.  The truth of the matter is that all cameras have idio syncracies and as the owner it is your job to figure them out and make the appropriate adjustments, and if you take the time to read this manual you'll find how easy it is to correct the problems you might find your having, and then you'll find what a joy this pocket size marvel is.  Last but not least, I am very much a beginner, but what I've learned quickly is that any program you use, be it photoshop, picture manager, and my recommended Picasa2 from google, the ease in which you can correct problems like red eye or sharpness, blurring etc.  are as easy to fix as one click away, so if your worried that your pictures dont look good when viewed on your beautifully massive lcd screen, DONT.

They'll see the pictures that you've taken time to correct(if you need to) on your computer, to which I promise can be absolutely stunning if you take a little time.

Problems/issues that other reviewers have noted do come up. I have already found ways of resolving them, either in the manual, or simply by trial and error. Photography is a hobby that takes patience. Digital photography is no different.It seems like many had high expectations for this camera, given it's $500 price tag. I agree that the price is a little too high for what you are getting in the DSC-T1. Realize that this still is considered a simple point-and-shoot camera though.This is the perfect camera if you're looking to carry a digital camera everywhere you go. The picture quality is very good, and realize that different conditions while taking the pictures need different settings. If you're looking for a camera that will take perfect pics on the Auto-everything mode... good luck with that!Blurry pictures are usually a result of camera movement. Like other reviewers have said, because of the compact size of DCS-T1 it makes it more difficult to steady in your hand(s). Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it. I also recommend that if the situation permits (time), you press the shutter button down halfway to allow the camera to focus and get a better read on the surrounding conditions, before pressing all the way. There is another reviewer who said that their blurry picture issue was resolved after a reset, which is worth a try too if you want. I have not had to reset my camera.The battery life is great. The AC adapter does connect directly to the camera, if needed. The Duo Memory stick is not too big of a problem simply because Sony includes the MS adapter, so the Duo will work in MS Pro slots just as easily. Definitely buy larger capacity MS Pro Duo sticks (most from SanDisk come with MS Pro adaptors). A tip for the LCD screen: cut to size and place a PDA screen protector over it for added protection against scratches.If you're frustrated with your DSC-T1, don't get discouraged so quickly. Keep using it, keep reading about it, and you'll find that it really is a great camera.4 out of 5 stars.

Coupled with my Canon i990 Printer it can provide a 6x4inch photo-quality print in under a minute (from taking photo)using the pictbridge direct printer connection.

Both the Canon models are very good at what they do.The 4MP SD10 (still considerably smaller and lighter than the Sony DSC-T1, but with no zoom) excels at taking short-range flash pictures indoors. I carried it in my shirt pocket and used it as kind of a notepad to record prospective film rentals, purchases, and all manner of things I might want to do more research on later. Also, if I happened to run across something of more photographic merit, at least there was some possibility of doing it justice.When more serious about taking photos somewhere, I would strap the S50 (5MP, 3x zoom) on my belt and expect generally high quality results.When the T1 was released, I saw it as potentially replacing the functions of these two cameras in one pocketable device. In truth, it is not quite as good at either end of the spectrum, but the results are close.For notepad use, you cannot turn it on (via the lens cover) with one hand and shoot with the same grip as you can with the SD10. In spite of the increased megapixels, the apparent resolution is about the same, and text appears sharper and cleaner on the SD10. The SD10 allows you to set a two second exposure delay, which enables you to steady the camera and avoid motion blurring caused by hitting the button. On the Sony, the delay is fixed at ten seconds, which is awkwardly long. The zoom on the T1 allows you to control your flash distance while still being able to completely frame your subject, as opposed to the fixed lens SD10. Once you've taken a photo, the screen and controls on the T1 are much better for scanning (or reading) the results in-camera. Of course, the SD10 is easier on the pocket and pocketbook.Not surprisingly, for general photographic use the Canon S50 still has an edge over the T1, but not by as much as you might think. When comparing shots of the same outdoor subject, I found the images from the Sony somewhat noisier, slightly less sharp, and a little overexposed. (I recommend turning down the EV in sunny environments.) Otherwise, there isn't much to distinguish them in most circumstances, which I find amazing given the dimensions of the T1. Also, it's nice to know how long your battery is going to last.At present, it is difficult to find a high capacity Memory Stick Pro Duo chip in stock anywhere at a reasonable price--sad that the T1 has been released before you can buy adequate memory.

It really is an engineering marvel, it's size, workmenship, ease of use, great pictures, fastest from off to ready of any digital camera and the BEST Screen on any camera.  A word to people looking for real reviews on this camera, I have read all the reviews here and I will say that the good things they say about this camera are true, but the bad things they say are mostly untrue.  You are buying this carmera for size and the large screen and for it's size it is the BEST camera out there PERIOD.  Seems like people either do not know how to operate a camera or are just trying to find any flaw they can on this product.  Lets see them build something better then this camera.  Now for all you cry babies out there complaining about this or that, you buy a camera this size for convience so you can put it in you pants or shirt pocket .  I have many great film and digital cameras that might take better pictures but who cares if you never take them with you because they are too heavy and large and you have to carry them at all times?  The T-1 is the one I have with me all the time so I never miss a shot.  Who cares if you have a camera that takes the most perfect picture in the world if you never take it with you because it is not convient to do so.  Honestly, how many of you have the best intentions of taking your camera to a theme park but at the last minute leave it in the car because you don't want to be stuck carring it it all day, not with this camera, you will have it on your person at all times.  The pictures that this camera takes for it's size are Astonishing.  RED EYE, who has a camera that you don't get red eye?  Though there are ways to help prevent it, learn how to use the camera.  POWER CORDS/DOCK STATION, you do not need the docking station to charge the camera, just the power cords, again learn how to use the camera.  SLIDING LID PROBLEM, I never had this problem sliding the camera into my pocket, must be the person that has the problem.  COLOR BALANCE, I just don't see what this person is talking about but you can adjust it, learn how to use the camera.  NO VIEW FINDER, I didn't think anyone used them anymore, I would glady not have one in order to have the 2 1/2 inch display which you can see under any lighting conditions.  FLASH PICTURE TOO DARK, I don't see this problem at all, there is a flash setting (normal, high, low) again learn how to use the camera.  NO TRIPOD MOUNT, how did you expect to have one on a camera so compact and dense with electronics, well since you should have a case to protect this camera anyway and Sony has the perfect case for sale (Active Case AJK-THA) with a built in tripod mount get one.  The camera never has to come out of the case for taking pictures, you can screw a tripod in the bottom of the case, works great.  BATTERY DRAIN, No more so then any other camera, try switching off the camera when not in use, with the super fast startup when switched on you could have this camera off more often then other cameras.  I can't say enough about  how much I like this camera.  Is it for everyone, no, it's a small camera, some people may find the small size a bit awkward, the controls are simple to use but again because of the small size they are on the camera so you might hit one inadvertently.

I have a 18month old and everytime I was ready to take a picture of him, he would turn his head when the camera would actually take the picture.  It was very slow and frustrating. I then decided to look at the T1 after the fact and found out the camera is very fast in taking pictures.  To make a long story short, I wound up selling my canon and buying the SONY.

I bought this camera after doing EXTENSIVE research and I am ecstatic with my decision.  I compared this to the Canon Elph, Kodak, and Olympus models.  The DSC-T1 just had more features and the HUGE LCD was ultimately the deciding factor.  Blurry photos??  Red Eye??  I have taken pics while running, of subjects that are moving quickly, in every type of light imagineable at various distances and NOT ONE TRACE OF BLURRY PHOTOS OR RED EYE.  There must be some defected cameras going around because I CANNOT GET THIS CAMERA TO TAKE A BAD PICTURE.  The ONLY downside is the program mode, which doesn't offer much flexibility.  No big deal to me.  I am generally a point and shoot type of photographer anyway.  The movie mode is unbelievable.  With a 512MB duo card, you can get at least 20 minutes of video at the standard picture quality.  Looks FANTASTIC viewing in Windows media player.  The dock is a great tool to charge your camera at the same time you are viewing them either on your computer or TV.  YOU CAN CHARGE THE CAMERA WITHOUT THE DOCK WITH THE SUPPLIED POWER CORD.

I was leaning towards the Canon S500, but went with the Sony T1 due to it's minimal size.  Since purchasing, we have taken numerous photos, using both the \"auto\" mode as well as the \"program\" mode with some of the suggestions from previous posters in this forum (adjusting ISO, EV, sharpness, etc.).  Overall, about 50% of the images are good to very good, and the remainder are very poor.  The problem seems to primarily be with the focusing sensor, as a lot of images are not in focus - now I know what you're thinking, maybe I just didn't have the subject in the center of the focusing brackets, or the subject moved after holding down the shutter, or whatever, but trust me - that is not the case.  I take numerous digital photos for work with Nikon, Olympus, and Kodak cameras, and only 5-10% of these are not in focus.In several of the pictures NOTHING is in focus, which doesn't make a lot of sense unless the AF sensor is just not picking anything to focus on!?Also, several of the photos have been blurred, even in bright sunlight, as though the shutter speed was too slow. (Yes, even when adjusting the ISO to 400).Anyway, it's now in for repairs to see if there actually is a specific problem with the camera.  As to the other issues:1.  Yes, red-eye is pretty bad, but easy to fix with software (no, I'm not using Sony's software).2.  I don't care that much about the missing tripod slot.3.  I've had no trouble keeping the lid closed.4.  USB and charger are a little bulky, but you can buy a small charger and USB from Sony, and/or buy a big enough MD card to hold images until you can download.5.  Camera functionality/ease of use is good and intuitive; I'd like a way to set the shutter speed, though...The bottom line is this - I would love this camera if I could consistently get good photos (i.e., in focus and not blurred) out of it.  If the camera gets fixed to solve these problems, I'll let you know; otherwise, I can not recommend it.", "Date": "July 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "I expected much more", "Author": "Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"", "ReviewID": "R1KA2N1WPY8241", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 6 months. I wanted a simple point & shoot to replace a old and dead Kodak DX3900. The kodak was great, except it lasted about a year (seems to be a common problem). I never got a blurred image, and very rarely was anything other than crystal clear. With the T1, it has been a battle. I have gone to other sites trying to find tweaks, etc.First the good:1. The LCD screen is really great. Large, clear, and seems to repel fingerprints (not one in 6 months of use).2. This fits in your pocket (but I do NOT recommend it, as scratching the screen will be VERY expensive).3. The buttons, although having a decent learning curve, become easy to use pretty quickly (except for deleting pictures you just took....because that button also controls the resolution, I sometimes switch back and forth accidently).4. Lens cover. Not only does it protect the lens, but it's kind of cool, and turns it on and off.5. Close-ups are just astounding (if you are steady). I can get less than an inch from something with absolute clarity (just make sure you have enough light).6. The video is better than on my Sony Camcorder (when recorded on the memory stick).Now the Bad & the Ugly:1. Flash is terrible indoors without tweaking2. Auto mode is useless unless you have plenty (and I mean PLENTY) of light3. Lag is so long that my 17 month is sometimes completely out of the frame when the picture is actually taken, or, there is such a blur that it looks like he's a world class sprinter.4. Telephoto is weak, and produces more noise than I would like.5. Battery life is terrible, and appears to drain even while off!6. This is not a point and shoot, at least not what I was looking for. You have to change the settings for every different situation.7. Impossible to take video indoors unless there is PLENTY of light.8. Red eye is terrible, even with reduction on, people look like demons.Now, for those who went ahead and bought this camera:For indoor shots, I have found the best way to get good light shots is by playing with the white balance. This also eliminates the yellow hue that is in most of the indoor pictures I had previously taken. I only switch to Auto mode if I am outside and it is sunny. Otherwise, you are stuck in program mode and have to set things up semi-manually. You don't need to pick your f-stops or anything, but it is a bit of a hassle making the needed adjustments for each particular shot. The night shots are very tricky. You can get some great effects, but it takes a lot of practice and experimenting.This is more a camera for a hobbyist than someone who wants to just snap pictures. And that is why I give it only 2 stars.

The size is incredible, it is the size of a credit card and only weighs 6.3 ounces. The body is made of a high quality metal, and feels good in your hand.There's no optical viewfinder on the T1, so you'll have to make do with the huge and gorgeous 2.5\" LCD on the back. It uses transreflective technology, found on PDA screens, so that the LCD doesn't wash out in sunlight.The camera also has a 3x optical zoom, but the lenses don't stick out of the camera. Instead, Sony put the zoom mechanism inside the camera body and uses a prism to reflect the light from the main lens. Very cool.The flash is weak, and drops off after about 6-7 feet. Red-eye is also a problem with a lot of my indoor photos, and the red-eye reduction doesn't reduce the effect all the time.

The camera does a good job most of the time though.You can also shoot movies with sound at 640x480 resolution at 30 frames per second, but you need a Memory Stick Pro Duo to accomplish this due to it being faster than regular Memory Sticks.

Going in I'd done a lot of research and found the A95's reputation is outstanding.  But Sony's general reputation -- and especially on the Cybershot DSCP 100 -- is outstanding too.The store was out of the Nikon, and since it had been the camera I was least impressed with after reading the reviews, I didn't worry about it too much.  The DSCP 100 had all the right numbers and features, but didn't feel right to me for some reason.  Maybe the shape threw me off?  Honestly, I'm not sure.  But the vibe wasn't right and so I asked to see the A95.By this time, the clerk and I had started chatting, and he pulled out the T1.  Honestly, I had not come across the T1 in my research, so when the store clerk pulled out this little gem from behind the counter, I was blown away.The thing is tiny.  And oh-so-beautiful.  The LCD screen on the back is almost the same size as the screen on my Treo 600 -- on other words, huge.  The camera felt great in my hands.  And a Zeiss lens -- wow.  That's top quality there.  As soon as I touched it, I began lusting after this mystery camera.  But was it any good?But let me digress.  The A95 is solid.  Just pure solid.  Nice quality.  Good build.  Picture quality looks good.  Screen is ... well, small -- especially compared to the T1.  The A95 is physically a much larger camera -- though surprisingly, the weight felt about the same as the T1.  Controls seemed intuitive and it's got lots of settings to play around with, but that don't get in the way of taking a simple snap shot.But the T1 has the sex appeal.  So I kept going back to it.  Without reviews, I was flying a little blind, but the fit and finish felt good.  And, did I mention the sex appeal?But as I kept looking, practicality began creeping into the deliberations.  For instance, the T1 uses a Sony-proprietary battery and memory system.  The A95 uses AA batteries and SD memory.There's no way of easily protecting the T1's super-large (and super fragile) LCD screen.  The A95's LCD flips around so that the screen is protected by the camera body.The T1 has no view finder and no way to take pictures if you aren't using the LCD.  The A95 can be used with or without the LCD (which increases battery life).The T1 has a 3x optical zoom.  The A95 has a 3x optical zoom, coupled with a digital zoom.The T1 has no tripod mount.  The A95 does.\"Weighing\" in favor of the T1 are the A95's larger size, smaller screen, and the \"cool\" factor of the T1.As I played with both cameras (until the store just about closed), I noted a couple of other things about the T1 in the back of my mind.  It wasn't until I read many of the reviews here that these perceptions began to crystallize.Holding the T1 steady is a major issue.  (With the A95 I was able to take handheld low-light, no-flash pictures with minimal blurring.)  The flash on the T1 was ho-hum.  And despite the large LCD screen, telling which images were crisp and which were blurry was a major challenge with the T1.  Really, the only way to tell would be to download the images to your computer before deciding which pictures are keepers and which are deleters.In the end, I listened to my wallet and my brain.  I bought the A95.  I needed reliability and quality more than glamour and glitz.  The SD storage cards are about half the price as the Sony cards -- and that issue of the proprietary batteries is a big one.So far so good -- picture quality on the A95 looks good, although I can tell that I'm going to have to learn to use the different \"scene\" settings in order to get the best out of the camera.  Even so, the A95 is easy to use.  (It even fit perfectly in a cheap generic camera case!)  I'll have to post again as I get to know my new camera better.Hopefully you'll find this review of use.  In the end -- both cameras are keepers in my opinion.  Which one you pick is probably more a matter of personal preference than anything else.

The big size gives added protection and also the good grip.2] Night Pics are no good ---- Guys u NEED to read the manual and play with settings. I have taken pics in PITCH DARK room with flash (ofcourse) and subject being 10feet from camera...with VERY GOOD results. You have to keep one thing in mind, that hands should be very stable. Well even the best SLR's require that.3] Memory Stick Duo =====  I dont understand why ppl make fuss about this. well i agree that they are little expensive, but considering the size for the memory..you have to agree there is no other format as small as the memory stick and SD.how often do u really swap memory cards with other devices.4] Daytime Pictures are Simply Beautiful. No doubt about those.Again ...check your settings, whoever gets dark or grainy pics.Here's a clue...try playing with EV setting. U'll see MAGIC.5] Tripod Not required === Folks cmon...this is ultracompact camera...Its supposed to be used as Point and shoot. Its not for Photo Studios or for doing your Model portfolio. The purpose is to Point and Shoot and Be on ur way...and not being on the scene for 30mins fixing ur Tripod.6] Sony should have provided a simple case. === yes i agree with this. Due to the delicate and precision electronics, they should have given minimal protection equipment with it. Anyways, i have heard that Apple IPOD case fits this easily.7] Large Screen Display === This is THE MOST ATTRACTIVE feature of the camera. I think other companies should follow this standard. We DONT need a few finder now. Also those who said that the screen isnt bright in sunlight. I'll say check ur Eyes or check the Settings ....cuz mine just works fantastic.8] Cradle issues === I personally didnt like the Cradle too. I would prefer a set of cables instead. but whoever said that cradle is too bulky....folks u need a workout...the cradle is as light as ur mouse and even smaller is size.

I did, however, get the T1 to replace my Pentax Optio S4, and the the T1 beats it in all categories.The T1 starts up quickly (maybe even faster than my Canon 10D), and using a Mem Stick Duo PRO, it is FAST shot-to-shot.  You will get considerable noise when shooting above ISO 200, so get some good noise removal software to go with it if you plan to shoot in less than the brightest light (Neat Image or Noise Ninja).  The noise is quite bothersome on screen if not removed, but hardly shows in smaller prints - unless severly scrutinized under a magnifying glass.As previously mentioned, the flash range is quite short, but I have been able to work around this by using a lower contrast setting (and higher flash setting at times), and simply boosting the brightness in Photoshop.  So far, so good - with noise removal software, of course.  The dynamic range is quite respactable for an ultracompact, so detail can still be salvaged using this method.The lens is a llttle slow (3.5 at the widest) so low light performance is average at best.  The lack of a tripod mount aggravates this, so be sure to steady your hand by leaning on a table, wall or other nearby object.If thise were you ONLY digicam, then you may be disappointed if the utmost image quality for larger prints is what you are looking for.

Granted the price seems steep, but the quality of the photos have truly been a relative shock to my traditionalist senses. On a recent trip to New York, it was sheer bliss to have such a high quality camera that I could carry in my shirt pocket all day, every day. The slim size and barely-there weight are ideal for ultimate portability. And there are a variety of settings that make for some great point-and-shoot pictures, whether it's using the 5M pixel camera at 3M pixel resolution, the amazing Smart Zoom feature, or the 5 MP mode, all produce excellent results. I also like the Photoshop-like extras such as the in-camera cropping of images, and in-camera image resizing for e-mail purposes. Although I barely use it, the movie mode is top-notch, easily comparable to the high quality digital-video tape camcorders I have tried in the past, 30 frames per second at 640x480 pixel size image.Whether using the static or movie settings, the quality of the imagery is easily comparable to the results I get with my traditional Canon Rebel. I am amazed at the color quality, saturation and preciseness in image detail, having now produced a number of 8x10\" photos suitable for framing. Reading the 100-page instruction book is essential to maximize the features of the camera, and allow time to practice before using it for special occasion shots. And you should buy a few high cost high speed 256MB or 512MB memory cards to avoid frustrating capacity issues.

I said to myself, \"Finally a small compact camera with a large LCD display.\"  When I received it, I was even happier. It looks fantastic and the controls, menus and ease of use are incredible. And with the iPod case (it fits perfectly!), it is extremely portable. \"Well,\" I thought to myself. \"Let's see how the pictures look.\" Here's the story. In daylight, the colors are dull and lack-lustre; kind of faded and washed out. I use iPhoto and the \"enhance\" feature takes care of most of this problem. Where the T1 really misses the boat is with it's built in flash. If your subject is more than 5 feet away, (yes, just 5 feet away) the flash just doesn't illuminate enough for a good picture. In fact, the flash photos are terrible! They're extremely noisy and the colors are way off. I've seen better flash photos with a 1.3 mega-pixel camera. I really wanted this camera to work for me. I tried every setting and even called customer support. But ultimately, I returned it. To me, if the pictures aren't good enough, the rest really doesn't matter.

It also has the beach mode that helps you to take pictures with a lot of sun and they will appear in the lcd screen as if you were in any place but in the beach, the snow mode is very useful too because in that case the image wont be that \"bright\" because of the snow it will appear like a beautiful postcard, forget about bad pictures in every weather, every place. I also tested it taking pictures to a tv show and it looks like if you were taking a pic to a real person it erases the lines that usually are on the tv screen this a bonus thing huh!. You may think that it uses a different memory stick because it is smaller but don't worry!! in the package it has an adaptor to make a normal memory stick so you can insert it in your computers (vaio users) or printers.

I was going on interviews across the country to schools and I wanted to be able to record my experiences. I wanted something small that would be powerful and be able to record video and pictures that were highquality.My experience with the T-1: I haven't used the newer models but what I found about the T-1 was it was extremely inituitive. Pretty much you just slide the front down and on the side, click it to picture and you're ready to go. The LCD display resolves well in both sunlight and at night. To change flash modes, you just fiddle with the controls. Extremely simple. Going to videocamera mode isn't hard, you just click the notch down for video recording.At night panaroma views- the camera doesn't resolve very well. If you use the flash, the background doesn't come out. If you don't use the flash, the light doesn't come in clearly. Everything is sorta muddled. It's extremely frustrating.What makes this camera shine is the videorecording capability. I've recorded videos at Coldplay concerts from half a stadium away- with the camera zoomed in. It's amazing. The sound comes in crisp clear and the resolution is sharp. I like how the camera is so small and you can get quality videos.Problems about the T-1: I didn't give it the full 5 stars because of the price and difficulty in getting clear pictures on the go. I spent over 500 to buy the t-1 two years ago. It's signficantly cheaper but still the newer models are at about the same price I bought the original for.I had difficulty getting clear-well resolved pictures and I did read the owner's manual. You have to hold the camera really still and brace your arms onto something stable to get non-shaky pictures. In the commercial with Aerosmith's lead singer, the girls are sitting at a restaurant and one of them whips out the camera and takes a picture of him walking by. It's true the camera is quick to respond but I doubt she was able to get a clear shot of the guy with her arm shaking like that.If you want a camera that has the wow factor. amazing video recording quality and solid picture capabilities (if you can keep the camera still), this t-1 is for you. you'll find it for middle 300's almost everywhere now and it's definitely a bargain.

This camera is very fast which helped quite a bit when taking pics of my toddler and preschooler who are always moving.  The other reviews explain the camera very well, but there's something I'd really like people to know.The beautiful LCD on this camera can break very easily and is very expensive to fix.  This camera has no regular view hole, so if the LCD is broken, you have no idea what you're taking pictures of.  My Olympus C3040 has a nice LCD too, but Olympus was smart enough to put a heavy plastic lens over the LCD to protect it.  For some reason Sony made the choice to leave the LCD exposed.  I've broken the lens on mine twice and have now given up on the camera.  The first time, it was in it's case and the second time it was in my pocket (which you'll be tempted to do since it's so small and easy to carry). If you break it, you can have it fixed, but that will cost about 3/4 of what you paid for the camera or you can buy an LCD and try to fix it yourself.  Doing it yourself is not so simple because of the way it was made.  My husband who sometimes works on circuit boards had to use a microscope to solder it because it just didn't go together correctly.So.... SONY! PLEASE UPDATE THE CAMERA AND ADD A PLASTIC LENS OVER THE LCD!And...If you do buy the camera, please consider buying a hard sided case for it.

The flash is inadequate and night-time indoor pictures have a lot of blurriness.  Daytime photos, however, have turned out great with excellent sharpness.The 32MB card it comes with is good for a few photos and a couple of short videos.

When taking pictures, make sure to hold the shutter button down until the photo is done.  The camera is so small that any movement can make a shot blurry.  2. Use the optional strap; sooner or later this camera will slip out of your fingers.  Trust me on this one.  3. DEFINITELY buy a hard case (eBay was my source).

I always read reviews before buying a product but I didn't have time.  I assumed that if I paid $500 for a camera it would work.  I bought the Cybershot mainly for its size.  I thought the LCD panel was cool.  I got over the coolness quickly.The camera looks awesome and everyone who looked at it said the same.  Cool right?  I snapped off about 30 pix in San Fran and another 40 at the Rocky Mountain National Park during my trip.  Talk about bad timing to test a new camera.  Like I get to the Rocky Mountains all the time.  I get home and unload the pix.  Results?  Blurry DAYTIME pictures.  I mean bad.  I could see blurriness on the picture on the LCD panel.  That's how bad.  Night pix are worthless.  I don't care about red eye since I can fix it but it was noticeably worse than my other cameras.I get home and delete over half the pictures because quit frankly they sucked.  I was pissed.  I had some cool shots that I had to delete.  Some of which was on my b-day with some hot chicks.  Dammit!!I then realized that I had to hold the camera absolutely still to get a descent shot.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and wanted to be patient with the product.  Even then I had blurry and out of focus shots.  I took this camera to a party.  Snapped a bunch of shots and same results.  In fact every picture that someone else took I had to delete because they weren't holding the camera absolutely still.  WTF.  Normally I send all my pix to friends after we're out.  I have none worthy enough to give them.  Absolutely frustrating.Many people said to use manual mode.  What?  $500 and the camera is not smart enough to adjust for even daytime pix.  Give me a break.

I tried every trick I could think of to eliminate this, which included all of Sony's recommendations. Nothing worked. I'd say that 70% of my pictures have some degree of red eye. Secondly, the picture quality is just not satisfactory for a 5 megapixel camera. I noticed very little difference between quality from my friend's 3.2mp Cybershot and this one, and that includes when I printed them out. The only difference in quality I noticed is that his had a lot less red eye. Pictures also came out too dark for a camera with a flash. Third, the sliding cover on the front does not stay shut! When I took the camera with me on trips or in my car, I actually taped down the cover. Very annoying. And my biggest problem with the camera, is all the extra junk you have to buy. Firstly, the cables it comes with for transferring pictures and charging are a real hassle. They're bulky and it was a big pain carrying them around with me when I went on trips. And secondly, at the average setting, you can take 12 pictures with the included memory card. Of course, you can buy additional memory cards, but when you're paying so much for a camera, why should you have to? I want to be able to take at least 24 pictures at a decent setting before I have to start removing some.Overall, I am very disappointed with this purchase, and wish I had waited a year or so for them to work out some of the bugs with it.

The size and weight is ideal for ultimate portability. Using this 5M pixel camera at 3M pixel resolution, using the smart zoom feature, or 5 MP mode produces excellent results. The T1 also allows in-camera croping of images, and in-camera image resizing for e-mail purposes. The high quality movie mode is comparable to high quality digital-video tape camcorders, 30 frames per second at 640x480 pixel size image, with the exception of typical camcorder better optical zoom capability. The camera also allows one to view and edit-out portions of the video. The image quality is stunning, and color quality and saturation is also spectacular. HQ video = 3 minutes fills 256MB card. SONY has definitely placed a great deal of engineering muscle into this device. I have produced a number of 8x10\" photos and am stunned at the color and image detail. The trick in any photography activity is knowing how to take good pictures and finding correct lighting, etc. Taking care of business, when framing the image, and setting the camera features, will produce truly great results. \"The camera that one can take everywhere is the best camera to have,\" is the remark I deliver to my students, and this device does not disappoint. Spend a few minutes reviewing the 100 page instruction book, buy several high cost high speed 256MB or 512MB memory cards, and have a great time capturing images every place you go throughout the day.

I should have listened to everyone's gripes, and so should you! Don't buy this camera! No amount of cool is worth the frustration, even though its \"cool factor\" can't be beat. After that's gone, there's not much appeal to this camera. For one, it has the weakest flash of any digital camera I've ever used; any pictures taken after sunset at more than 2' away are worthless. Another flaw is that your hands have to be completely still while shooting, or the picture is a blurry mess. The zoom is also weak, and taking pictures at the beach or in bright sun produce horrid, washed out images--even when using the beach icon option. In general, the picture quality is NOT what I expect from a 5.0 MP camera; the images I took w/ my previous camera, a 3.3 MP Olympus Camedia, were at least just as good and at most superior.
