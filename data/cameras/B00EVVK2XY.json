For general picture & video taking my Samsung Note 2 is easer to use and takes just as good picture as the D70.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,348.00", "Features": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with Dual Pixel CMOS AF and EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS with Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens\nIncludes: Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens, Transcend 32 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card, Ultra High Quality Battery Pack for Canon EOS,\nOpteka RC-4 Wireless Remote Control for Canon, Opteka OPT540 54\" Compact Professional Photo / Video Tripod,\nOpteka High Definition II UV (0) Ultra Violet Haze Multi-Coated Glass Filter, Opteka High Definition\u00b2 Professional 5 Piece Filter Kit (UV, CPL, FL, ND4 and 10x Macro Lens), HDMI Cable,\nOpteka Microfiber Deluxe Photo/Video Camera Gadget Bag for Digital Cameras & Camcorders, Opteka Digital Camera / Camcorder Lens Cleaning Kit, Tabletop Tripod, & LCD Screen Protectors, Jumpstart Guide to Digital SLR Photography in Snap DVD, 47 Street Photo Cleaning Cloth", "Name": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with Dual Pixel CMOS AF and EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS STM Super Kit with Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens, 32GB Memory Card, Spare Battery, Filters + More.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fLQMk0H-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EVVK2XY"}}
