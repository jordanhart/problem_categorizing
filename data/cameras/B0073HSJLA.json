{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Choice for Families", "Author": "L. Howard \"lisa2004\"", "ReviewID": "R1BVY1ALSMUZ08", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second Nikon waterproof camera we've purchased. The first was the AW100, and I like both cameras for different reasons. I bought the AW100 for me to use while scuba diving in shallow water, and I got the S30 for the kids to use in the pool. It's perfect for them. The buttons are large and easy to use, and I like the setup - the shutter button and video record button are both on top, separated by the on/off button, and all the menu, feature and playback buttons are on the back. I think this is a great design for kids.Many of the \"fun\" options in the camera are definitely designed to appeal to kids, but I'm looking forward to trying some of them, too, such as the time lapse and fireworks modes.In terms of images, the HD videos are very sharp, and the photos are also good, as long as you make sure to set the camera to the highest resolution. Note that if you select the option to add an in-camera frame to your images, the camera seems to default to the lowest resolution - 2 MP - so I would avoid this setting if you want good quality photos. You can always add a digital frame later with photo editing software.I think this is a great camera if you just want something to take to the pool or the beach and you don't want to worry about the kids dropping it in the water or on the ground. It's easy to use, takes good photos, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon. The only things I don't like about this camera are the AA batteries (I wish it used the same rechargeable as my AW100) and the battery/memory card door; I have to use both hands to slide the lock one way and slide the door the other way. You won't have to worry about the kids accidentally opening it, which is a good thing, but I much prefer the design of the AW100. Other than that, however, I think this is a great camera for the price.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kid-Focused Camera", "Author": "Ryzeldorf \"Ryzeldorf\"", "ReviewID": "R30PX7SHH3YAOK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera approx. 2 weeks ago and wanted my 4 year old son to get some use before rating. I feel I can provide a pretty fair summation now.So far he likes the camera a lot but there are a couple items that annoy me as the parent supervising said 4 year old.So...First the GripesNumber 1- The constant clock and date reset when changing batteries drives me nuts. If you skip it you get an annoying flashing warning!Number 2- Picture quality in lower light is poor to say the least. The camera has to be held very still and then it's a gamble. When the image does come out it looks like VGA phone cam quality. The auto-flash works when it wants, most times its out to lunch.Number 3- The resolution of the screen is marginal so its hard to see if the shot is ok or poor.Number 4- As another reviewer wrote, it would be great to disable the digital zoom. It blows right through optical and into the digital very easily.Number 5- It tends to make very vibrant colors look fake. See Hibiscus of the pictures I have attached...Now the Positive StuffNumber 1- The flash is in the center so the little guy won't cover it with either hand.Number 2- Battery life is outrageous- I got 532 outdoor shots out of a single pair of rechargeable Sanyo Eneloops and had battery life to spare but it was time to go home.Number 3- In outdoor use, in direct sunlight, the pictures are very vibrant.Number 4- There is virtually no delay when hitting the button for pictures. This makes a 4 year old very happy.Number 5- We spent 4 hours plus with the camera directly in water and often submerged. We were merciless as we're still within the return period.Number 6- Underwater shots are terrific and fun!My initial impressions when my son used the camera in our home were very bad mostly due to poor, blurry indoor images. Had we not given it a thorough tryout at a water park yesterday this review would look very different. The great pictures this camera created yesterday really helped me like the camera much more.In summary, this camera is good for a 4 year old with little adult assistance. This is not, however, a \"Family Cam\" as people old enough to use a more advanced camera will insist on doing so.Update 9/16/12We went swimming this weekend and after a few shots underwater I noticed condensation in the lense and display... Will contact Nikon this week. Only the third time in water and less than 5 feet deep. Hope to resolve soon.Update 9/18/12Called Nikon. Connected with a rep very quickly but sound quality and accent made it difficult to communicate. Rep said camera should not have been taken in the water and the camera is not waterproof!!! WOW!!!I stated the body of the camera, packaging and manual said otherwise. He said maybe he was wrong. Asked for my name and email and is supposed to be sending me a link with warranty info etc.Update 9/21/12Reviewed emails sent by tech. These aren't even form letter type emails. They are just links to the Nikon help website. In the email I was directed to an automated form to setup return. Guess what? The camera I am trying to return for service is not on the list. So called tech support again. \"Estimated hold time is 2 minutes...\" Took 13 minutes to connect. I mentioned the camera model is not on the service site. He informed me just to type up a note, print it and drop in the box. He then provided the address and recommended I ship with UPS. As I live next to a Fedex facility I asked if I could use FedEx. He mentioned he only recommends UPS as they give you a tracking number...hummm...Update 10/15/12Received camera back from Nikon. Everything was exactly as I sent it. I received a $0 invoice for cleaning and testing. There were no notes about anything found, just a poor photocopy of a page from the owners manual about the possibility of lens/ display moisture. I assume this means moisture in the body is normal? The phenomenon described in the paper was similar to what I experienced so I will try to use again and see what happens...", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice idea for kids, but not quite there", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1L47ZVR0O2S1M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My daughter was excited to receive this camera from me. There are several kid friendly elements to the camera like the placement of the shutter button, power button, and video button. Also, the flash is centered, so it is much less likely she will cover the flash with her fingers. She likes the camera and the LCD screen is fine. I can attest that it is rugged and waterproof since it was both dropped on vacation and used underwater at the pool.There a few things I don't like about the camera. The shutter button is difficult for her to press. There is no way to disable the digital zoom. She likes taking closeup pictures of things, but the S30 doesn't do well unless set in macro mode. However, the macro setting is only available after a few button clicks in the menu instead of a dedicated button. Also, my daughter likes to use the Decorate option to frame her photos as she takes them, but using decorations fixes the photos at small 2 megapixel shots. Low light performance isn't great for focusing or photo quality.She still enjoys the camera and picture quality is fine in good light. Much better than the typical \"toy\" child's camera.Note: Twice the camera has became stuck which prevented me from changing any settings or turning on the flash. This was fixed by choosing to Reset All in the camera settings.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just right for little hands", "Author": "Ginseng", "ReviewID": "R1DBFXPBTDTH39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 5-yo daughter dropped and broke my old Canon PnS that I gave her to use and since she has interest in taking snaps, I looked for a rugged camera that could survive her hands and yet be economical. This camera fit the bill. It is by and far the cheapest rugged water/shock proof point an shoot you can find. It makes cute animal sounds as alerts and the buttons are well placed. The user interface is simple and clean. It's like this was designed expressly for kids. I have no complaints at all except that you cannot set it to force flash. It's either auto or off. The camera does not activate the flash in many circumstances where it should be used. This results in blurry, grainy images where they should be flash-lit and fine. It waits for really dim light before it activate the flash. This is the only significant flaw in an otherwise well and appropriately designed camera.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A camera with this many features, for this little money - from Nikon!!!", "Author": "Michael Hoerman \"Michael Hoerman\"", "ReviewID": "RGKXQOYONFKEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nikon S30 is a great deal, don't let the downers fool you.

The pictures were only grainy when zoomed in all the way, but overall the pictures were good.  This camera was perfect for snorkeling and boating.  I got great underwater shots.  Extremely easy to use as well.  For a 7 day trip I only changed the batteries twice.  It took a beating on some rocks without breaking.  Most important of all it did not leak water into it and break like most of the other cameras available.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A so-so camera, OK for utility uses", "Author": "Gilbert Valnonnia \"G.V.\"", "ReviewID": "R1QQJUB26G30BZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My intended use for this camera:- Photographs of gardens and landscapes, mainly for before-and-after images, and for documenting technical aspects of in-progress landscape installation work. (Valves, wiring, carpentry, etc.)Why I bought this model:- Less than $150.- Runs on (2) standard AA batteries, not a proprietary power pack.- Advertised as waterproof to 10 feet. (Important because I may use it in wet / muddy conditions in the garden.)My experience so far:Received the camera in May 2012, took a few hundred shots, dropped it from about 3' onto a linoleum surface (really, not that big a drop,) at which point the LCD screen conked out. Warranty service was free (complete replacement) but took >6 weeks to process.Image quality is good (for such a small lens) *when the camera auto-focuses properly*, which is about 75% of the time, even in broad daylight. Frequently tends to over-expose shots in bright light.Distortion is quite noticeable, esp. when attempting portraits of faces from closer than about 6'.Macro/close-up mode is good to about 2\".Flash can be set to either \"Auto\" or \"OFF,\" but cannot be manually locked \"ON\". Can be annoying in certain low-light situations.Not sure about waterproof-ness, haven't tested the unit underwater or in heavy rain yet. (I may update my review after using the camera in the rain.)Verdict: Price a bit too high for a camera that doesn't reliably auto-focus or auto-expose. Still, for simple utility purposes, it's working OK so far. Don't expect great-quality images from it.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon COOLPIX S30", "Author": "Cara", "ReviewID": "R279S7FVJNPEP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent \"bang for your buck\"!

I ended up buying the Nikon COOLPIX S30 a few days before vacationing in Cancun and couldnt be happier! All of the settings, features, etc. are very clear and simple. Although geared towards children, this camera takes excellent underwater photos as well as good regular pictures.

This camera seems to be an either \"love it or hate it\" purchase....about half and half.  I fall into the LOVE IT category.In March this year I purchased a Kodak Sport C123 camera from Amazon.  It was cheap and was supposed to be waterproof.  I purchased it to take pictures while on a family cruise.  As soon as we got in the water, IT took on water.  Very disappointing.  As soon as I got home I sent it back to the seller from Amazon.  Sure it was cheap - but it didn't work either!A month or so later I was walking through Wal-Mart and saw this Nikon Coolpix S30 camera on the clearance table for $35.  It was brand new in the package; not reconditioned or a return.  I thought, \"Hey, why not give it a try?\" as I trust Nikon way more than Kodak (although I own many Kodak point and shoot cameras!).  I am so glad I did!My daughter and I just got off our cruise ship today - and we went to Half Moon Cay island, where I tried it out.  It took great pics on land and sea.  It took great pics inside and out.  Someone else posted about the flash not always going off - I agree - it seems to be whimsical, but heck, it's digital - take another shot then.  I'll post a few pics I took under customer shots.Even if it breaks after this it took much better pics than those tossaway cameras, and I'm very happy; although I think I'll have this camera for a few vacations to come!  :-)", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Believe the Negative Reviews", "Author": "David Clark \"Dbax\"", "ReviewID": "R4V3IG8NVS01Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas and was not able to try it out until June in Maui.

The picture quality (while obviously not comparing to our DSLR) is pretty good and we got some great pictures of the sea turtles and other underwater creatures we saw (images posted on the product page). I tried to hold the camera as steady as possible when taking pictures, but obviously that's difficult in the water, and the turtles aren't holding still to pose! Even so, we had very few blurry pictures.I put in brand new Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries before we left, and the battery indicator was still full when we we came home a week later, even after keeping it on for long periods of time while snorkeling and looking at all the photos each night. Got an Amazon basics 4 GB memory card that lasted all week as well (camera indicated it would hold about 700 pictures).The battery/card cover was hard to get open when we got back. It looks like it has some salt built up around the edges, so we'll see how it works the next time we use it. BUT, considering we took 300+ underwater pictures and the disposables would have cost about $10 each + $10 or so to develop and they only take 27 pictures each AND we'd only have printed, not digital, photos from them, it was still a great buy, even if we only get one vacation out of it.Bottom line: While I wouldn't make it my everyday camera, it worked great for underwater pictures, which is why we bought it, and I'm so glad we got this instead of wasting money on disposables. A word of caution: if you're using it in waves or taking it in and out of the water, make sure the lens is free of drops, since the screen can be hard to see in the sun. I wasn't paying attention and had some otherwise great above-water pictures obstructed by water drops on the outside of the lens.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good basic waterproof camera for beach and snorkeling", "Author": "Melissa Santo", "ReviewID": "R37UZC1052ZURR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was worried about buying this camera after reading some of the previous reviews, but its been great for me so far!  I wanted a basic waterproof camera, at least 10 MP, multiple settings (circumstances, zoom, macro, etc) for under $100.  I've used disposable water proof cameras in the past, but they're expensive and picture quality is poor.  I wanted something better that would hold up during a trip to the Caribbean.PROS: It\u2019s pink.  It\u2019s easy to use.  It takes good pictures underwater and respectable ones on dry land.  I\u2019m guessing those that say the regular use pics are awful don\u2019t have the camera settings right.  There are a bunch of cute photo editing options that I don\u2019t need, but imagine kids would like, or would be fun to play with if you\u2019re stuck in an airport.CONS: The wrist strap attachment is in the upper left corner of the unit, while the trigger button is in the upper right corner.  I have to keep moving the strap to the back of the camera so it doesn\u2019t cover the lens window.  When the AA batteries have to be replaced all the settings on the camera go back to the factory settings.  I have not had quick battery drainage issues that others have listed, and have been using the same pair for over a month.  It does NOT come with a SD card.BOTTOM LINE:  The photos aren\u2019t quite as good as my regular camera (canon) but are infinitely better than a waterproof disposable.  The stability and zoom aren\u2019t as good.  For my purposes (beach/snorkeling) this camera is great.  Until I take those diving lessons\u2026IMPORTANT TIP:  There is no viewfinder on this camera.  It is hard to see the screen in sunny circumstances.  If you\u2019re in and out of water, make sure there is no water on the lens window before you start snapping away.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "waterlogged not waterproof", "Author": "B.

This camera is not meant for kids, especially 5 year olds. I have given my kids a few cameras which lasted maybe 1 month and they were 15 and 20 years old and the only reason they failed was because they dropped them, any camera is going to fail after dropping several feet. I have been using this camera all week in Aruba with some taken in and out of the water and haven't found any problems with water leaking or fogging. I did one video while I was in the pool and it looked pretty good for a $70 dollar camera. Batteries last a long time and just replaced them after 3 days of partial use or maybe 60 to 70 photos and they were the original standard batteries that came in the box. The battery compartment gives me no problems with a inside latch that holds the battery in and a safety lock to close the compartment all together. Under water, the camera took some great photos of fish on a reef and never noticed the flash going off but all photos were plenty bright even in a partly cloudy day. From using at night, the flash did not work unless it was really dark, but again, I only bought this camera for the water and beach during the day. I use my more expensive $350 camera for other shots especially at night. I do think they will have to fix the flash issue because in the menu it only gives you the option auto or off and I do not think the light sensor is very accurate. When I did use the camera when it was somewhat dark, I just covered the sensor with my finger so the flash would go off.

I haven't used it there yet but I have used it around the house and while hiking. It takes excellent pictures outside. Indoors, the quality can sometimes be sub-par. This is usually a problem with point and shoots (getting the lighting right indoors) but this one really requires a lot of light to take a good picture without the flash. The other downside is it is a little bit bulkier than my last waterproof camera, but only slightly so. Otherwise, it is an unbelievable deal. It has almost all the settings that more expensive cameras do. Unfortunately, there is only one macro setting, but that's not too important to everyone. Settings are changed on the camera using an lcd menu, which is not as easy as the dial that many cameras come with, but after learning how to work the menus I think it is just as easy. I think for the money, it's a great camera for someone who spends a lot of time outside and wants to use the camera for such situations. Not a good purchase for someone that wants to take mostly indoor pictures or even for someone who really wants to use it for taking underwater snorkeling pictures. Considering the low-light issues with this camera and the small depth restriction, it would be better to purchase a more expensive underwater camera if using primarily for underwater picture taking.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Video not very reliablle", "Author": "Bill P \"wpow1953\"", "ReviewID": "RXK3KQE1R9ON7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Excellent little camera.

Furthermore, the colors are atrocious.  The bright and strikingly vivid primary colors I would see with my own eyes would invariably come out as hazy, dull shades of blue in the photographs, even when set on the \"underwater\" setting.

So I invested in this digital camera, a much cheaper solution in the long run.  I can take pictures or vidoes, download them to my computer, and burn them to disk.  That way, if my computer crashes or a drive fails, I can still have them safe.  You have to buy a SD card with it.  My card is 16 GB and cost about $12, and I am told that should hold about 800 pictures.  You can buy a case separately.  My 11-year-old son liked my camera so much, he bought himself the same camera;and he is having a blast using it!  It is easy to use, and comes with a USB cable for easy dowloading to the computer.  I love that it is shock proof; so if you accidentally drop it, it should still work.  You can make slide shows on your camera, and customize the screen or the photo borders.

Bought it anticipating it to be a replacement for my Flip video camera and bc I expect to use it for mostly snorkeling and shooting video for swim drills.  I may only use it for swim drills.  First off, kudos to the waterproofing system.  I just got back from giving it a test run in my gym's pool and there were no problems.  Video quality on a 1-10 scale, (10 being 1040HD), I'd put it somewhere between 3 and 4.  Picture taking...DO NOT, repeat DO NOT buy this for its picture taking features.  I am a novice DSLR user and taking pics with this thing seriously pisses me off.  There is a microsecond delay between the time you press the button and when the pic is actually taken so unless your subjects are standing perfectly still, you're not getting the shot.  Bottom line:  If you want a get-me-by waterproof tool, something you need to have handy, or on a tight budget - this is suitable.  If you can spend a little more, look at higher end items.

Being a product sold 6 years earlier, I cannot find a new battery. I found a generic battery which was completely useless. What is the point of having a camera but you cannot find or buy a battery to run it?Most cameras run on proprietary batteries. Just another way for the manufacturers to earn more money from you.A proprietary battery can cost from USD50-150 a piece. And for a USD100 camera?This camera is waterproof and kinda shock proof. I expect it to last. So having AA batteries is vital. I want to be able to use this camera in 10 years!Contrary to the idea of making this camera simple to use, I find it difficult. I don't think kids will know how to utilize the controls. Of course, switching it on and pressing the shutter is easy enough but to switch off the flash requires several button presses.Being a happy-snapper, hardly any controls that you can adjust, the picture quality is decent. Don't expect too much from a small aperture camera with a tiny sensor. You pictures are not meant to be enlarged beyond 5X7 prints.It will never be able to take better pictures than other compacts even at this price range. But those, you will not be able to bring underwater or at the beach or pool side.The video shooting is fairly straightforward with a separate shutter on the left.I cannot say that this camera is bad because there are no fair comparison.

We debated between this one and a camera specifically designed for kids. We decided on this one, though a little more expensive, because we wouldn't be embarassed to carry it as an adult and it's a Nikon. The box labels it as \"Water Proof, up to x meters\" and \"Shock Proof\" (with no specification as far as height). My daughter loved carrying it around and snapping photos and videos. Then, she tripped and the camera fell to the ground. The display screen was broken. We contacted Nikon customer service right away. My husband was told that the camera is only shock proof BELOW 2.5 feet. Seriously? So, if you're carrying your camera below your knee and drop it, then it's covered. But, anything above 2.5 feet isn't covered. Our seven year old is probably around three feet tall. We were told the breakage wasn't covered. My husband's reply \"Do you think she was carrying the camera on her head?!\" Long story short, they refused to fix it. They refused to replace it. I even sent in an email, stating I am a professional photographer, who uses only Nikon products and that if they didn't step up their customer service I would make sure all my photographer friends knew how subpar their service is. I received back a form email! In the end, we had to take it back to the store, argue with THEIR customer service as well, before receiving a refund.

I don't even normally write reviews, but had to so that others wouldn't make the mistake of buying this camera and having it break at an inopportune moment.I bought this camera for a trip to the caribbean. When I got it home and tested it out, the pictures were decent in daylight, but HORRIBLE in even the shade. Totally grainy, blurry, etc. In the bright daylight, I will say the pictures weren't bad. But the video camera was so confusing to work. You have to push the button about twice before it turns on, then its really hard to tell when it turns off.On our cruise, I took it in the water with us at the beach. It worked good one day, getting a few fun underwater pictures near the surface. However, the camera SUCKED the life out of the batteries quickly. I mean I went through like 6 sets in 2 days. It was horrible and totally not practical at all. They need to make this a camera like other cameras that charge in the wall or computer.The day we went to Stingray city, I put in brand new batteries just minutes before going in the water with the stingrays. Not even kidding you, I took one picture, and the camera said battery life exhausted. I was sick. Luckily my parents had a non- waterproof camera so that we got a few pictures, but I was super bummed. This same thing happended again when we went cave tubing. Batteries didn't even work for an hour before they were sucked dry. Barely got any pictures of our fun adventure.Our last adventure was snorkeling. This camera states to be waterproof to 9 feet. We went snorkeling in a reef and didn't take the camera more than 6 feet underwater. When we got to the surface, the camera had let water in. It shorted out and went completely dead.At least I got my money back from Target, but for being a Nikon, I was really surprised at what a big piece of junk this is.
