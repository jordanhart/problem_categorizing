{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unless you are a sport journalist, I don't think you can go wrong with this camera", "Author": "Sidarta Tanu", "ReviewID": "R1J0URX8PAI5E8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 6 Megapixel Nikon D40 is targeted for those who want a relatively compact and light camera yet having most of the important SLR features. The D40 is priced reasonably (cheaper than D50/D80 and Canon Rebel XTi). In my opinion, if you are still considering whether to get a point and shoot camera or a DSLR, the D40 will be a better choice than any point and shoot camera, by far, even those with 8MP or 10MP. But if you are already deciding to get a DSLR or you want more control of the picture taking experience, then I would recommend you to also test the D50 and/or D80 first before deciding to buy the D40. I want you to make sure that you know what you will get (and not get) with the D40. Don't get me wrong though, the D40 is an awesome camera, and I don't think you will regret buying one. There are some limitation with the D40 which shouldn't bother most people, for example, the D40 doesn't have dedicated button to change picture quality, white balance or ISO settings (which generally only professional/enthusiast will care). Once you understand (and accept) its limitation, the D40 is a potent and exciting photography machine.Just like all its (DSLR) siblings, the D40 powers on instantly and take pictures with almost no shutter lag which are the major advantages of a DSLR over a point and shoot camera. In addition to the P,S,A,M mode, the picture quality of the auto settings (auto, child mode, landscape etc) are also very good. With 2.5 frames per second you can capture movement progress in sports like football, basketball, baseball etc.  Also great to photograph your family or child (child mode). The D40 is a great all around camera.Some notable new features:1. Auto (no flash) mode. Without this mode the flash will pop-up (on all other pre-programmed mode) even when you don't want to use flash (which can be annoying). The internal flash will not pop up automatically with the P,S,A,M settings.2. In camera editing capability such as black and white, sepia and some filter effects etc. While sounds gimmicky, these features are useful especially for those who doesn't have Adobe Photoshop (or other image editing software).To date, D40 is the smallest and lightest among all the Nikon DSLR (even smaller than the Canon Rebel XT/XTi, however the D40 is more ergonomics). I believe that choosing a camera that fits comfortably with your hands is important. Therefore, I recommend people to test the camera before buying (even if you want to buy online, please do go to a physical store and test the camera first whenever possible).The D40 has only 3 (horizontal) autofocus point (5 for D50 and 11 for D80). If you know \"The Rule of Thirds\", the additional AF points above and below the center focus point (available in D50 and D80) are handy to help create the horizontal third line.  However, the 3 horizontal AF point in D40 is still helpful to create the vertical third line. Also one can focus with the middle AF point and after the focus is lock then move the frame upwards/downwards to create the horizontal third line. Just make sure the exposure level is still accurate when you move the frame after you lock the focus.About the 18-55mm II AF-S kit lens: A good lens producing sharp photos (though not a very fast lens). Also decent for close-up/macro photography. Lens uses internal focus technology and focusing operation is silent. A very decent kit lens.Lens compatibility: Notice that with D40, autofocus function will not work for non AF-S/AF-I lens. If you already have non AF-S/AF-I Nikon lenses and want a backup or replacement camera, you will be better off buying D50, D70s or D80. If you buy the D40, it will be convenient to stick with AF-S and AF-I type lenses. I'm not sure why Nikon choose this route for the D40 (whether to enable smaller size camera or from now on Nikon will only make AF-S lens compatible camera). There are a lot of good Nikon AF-S lenses (price range added: low, medium, high) that are fully compatible with the D40 such as:- Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S (M)- Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G ED IF AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S DX VR (M)- Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX VR (L)- Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR (M)- Nikon 12-24mm f/4G ED IF AF-S DX (M)- Nikon 17-35mm f/2.8D ED-IF AF-S (H)- Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX (H)- Nikon 28-70mm f/2.8D ED-IF AF-S (H)- Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR (H)- Nikon 105mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Micro (M)- And several other expensive prime tele/zoom lens like 200-400mm, 300m, 400mm, 500mm, 600mm.High priced lens ($1000+) are usually pro level lens which usually have better construction, faster (f-stop), and produce better quality picture. However, often times, lower price lens will serve your needs just fine. I think it is important to know what you want to use the camera for before deciding which camera and lens to buy.Image quality of the D40 is very good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera.Here are the pros and cons of the D40 in my opinion:Pros:1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality2. Affordable price3. Compact size and light weight4. Large and bright 2.5 inch LCD5. 2.5 frames per second6. B/W, Sepia, several more in-camera editing features.7. Instant power on, fast autofocus and no shutter lag8. Noise is acceptable at high ISO settings. Auto ISO settings available.9. Great 18-55mm II AF-S kit lens.10. Great battery life (400+ on a single charge. 1000+ if flash is not used).11. Auto (flash off) mode available12. 1/500 flash syncCons:1. No direct button to change QUAL, WB and ISO settings2. Grip comfortably but might be a bit too small for some people3. No top LCD and no front command dial4. Autofocus will not work with non AF-S or non AF-I lenses (such as the 70-300m G and 50mm f/1.8D lens)5. No AF/MF switch (have to use the switch on the lens)6. Only 3 autofocus point7. 6 Megapixel (More Megapixel needed to print larger than 12 X 18 at 300 dpi)8. No night landscape mode in pre-programmed settings9. No in camera image stabilization (like Sony and Pentax) but Nikon has lenses with it (VR).10. No depth-of-field preview buttonIn conclusion, the D40 is perfect for those who want high quality pictures, more control (than a point and shoot camera), and have a DSLR experience (instant power on and no shutter lag), without having to carry a bulky camera.  And unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer might be needed), the D40 is pretty much all you will need.Happy Photographing!Sidarta Tanu", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "A superb deal for an excellent entry level DSLR camera.", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R1IIC4WRFGK5US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an ergonomical, fast handling, very solidly built Digital SLR with many excellent features (like a 2.5 inch silky smooth and bright lcd found on the $1600 D200). Pictures are beautiful.  It uses the same excellent 6 megapixel sensor from the D50, D70, D70s. 6 megapixel is plenty, I get tack sharp 8x12 inch prints. Don't get stuck in counting megapixels.  6MP from a DSLR will blow the doors off a 6,7,8MP compact or even DSLR-like cameras. Especially under low light conditions.  6mp is 3008x2000 pixels.  10mp is just 3888x2592pixels. Not as much difference as many people think.A Nikon DSLR body only for $499 or $599 with the lens?  Darn.  Nikon pricing strategy is so aggresive. With the D80 at $999 and 400DCanon at $799 body only.  The main drawback for the D40 is you'd have to stick with AF-S or AF-I lenses if you want to get auto focus. You can still focus manually with other Nikon lenses. I guess they did it so D50's resale value won't drop too much. With the D50 you have access to Nikon's wide and prestigous range of lenses. Needless to say it makes a difference.However, the kit lens is adequately sharp and responsive. For $100 it can't be beat as a good everyday use lens.  At wide angle 28mm distortion is minimal. Pretty sharp at the other end of the zoom, no distortion.It has a 3-point auto focus system, thats good enough. In fact I prefer it that way.  I never cared for 7, 10, 11 point or more focus systems.No more top mounted LCD display, so what? Just use the beautiful 2.5\" color LCD display. It's fast to see from the eyecup to rear LCD.It's got a bunch of excellent in camera processing which the D50 and D70 never had. Red eye reduction, D-lighting-automatically compensates for darker areas, image-overlay, trimming(new feature), b&w; etc.  The new menu is beautiful. Also zooming in during playback has been improved(one thing I always found slightly inconvenient on the D50, D70).Very fast from power up to taking pictures.  Continous mode fires at 2.5 frames per second.For the price Nikon has really figured out how to built a solid , ergonomical , feature rich DSLR. Nikon really knows how to built solid SLRs. It is small in size but unlike the Canon 350/400d/xti(good picture and processor ,new dust reduction, but slightly less ergonomical and solid), you get a comfortable grip that doesn't make your hand feel cramped.For this camera, Nikon also came out with a new flash SB400(works on the D50 too) if you need a more powerful flash.  The built in flash is excellent and accurate and powerful enough for most situations.I've had a bunch of digital cameras , Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Fuji, Sony 3ccd HiDef, Canon XL1 etc. The D40 is a superb camera for beginners or even semi-experienced enthusiasts, or as a second camera.  You can save the money and buy some lenses or strike some big prints.", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Simply the best", "Author": "Daniel J. Zajic", "ReviewID": "R1UX6DYZY8NSPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon has hit a grand slam with this camera. It's as close to perfection as any digital camera has ever come. Sure, there are \"better\" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Made for beginners but a great walking camera for pros too!", "Author": "P. Burnett \"pbdesignphotography\"", "ReviewID": "R320CC9TN010FW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a compliment to my current professional system based on the Nikon D2X. It's a great \"walking around\" camera for a pro as it will do all the things that pros are used to asking of a camera, great nikon metering, kit lens is decent, programming and screen quality are par with the flagship D2X. All this makes it the perfect 2nd camera or \"pro's snap shot camera\". I would not consider doing pro work with it, that's the X is for, but as far as it shooting excellent quality, tough nikon build quality, superior metering and battery performance for, so far in my testing, over 600 shots! The downside is, and I say this as primarily a prime lens shooter, it will only AF with AF-S or AF-i lenses, or those with built in focusing motors. Yes, this kinda sucks, but really only to those who probably rely on AF too much anyways. The novices will probably only use AF-S lenses and the kit lens at that. As a pro, I tend to shoot the D2X full manual and often only turn on AF when needing a quick shot, the rest I still focus by eye. Most of the pros I know do this as well.SO, if you are a pro and, like me, long for the days when you carried around that old tank of a film camera (FE2 for me!) but wish there was a digital equivalent that could do all it would do and more, then this is a perfect compliment to your system. If you are a beginner, and you started with this camera, it would open up a whole new world of professional digital photography for you and then you'd want to move up to the D80, D200, then possibly D2X or beyond (when available) but I guarantee you'd keep this one for fun even if you moved up.The point is this camera is fun, advanced features for pros, ease of use for novices, and much more accessible, super lightweight camera for all.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Keeper", "Author": "Gadget Man \"Gadget Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1ASKGBMS09391", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I go through lots of cameras.  This was my third DSLR, and about 15th to 20th digital camera. THe D40 takes superb pictures.  Don't let the reviewers mislead you into thinking this is just for newbies.  It works great for newbies, and for serious advanced photo-enthusiasts.  I fall in the latter category and like the camera for the following reasons:1.  Size and weight - easy to travel with.2.  Great image quality right out of the camera.  It's nice to enhance photos in software like Photoshop.  But it's even better to have a camera that doesn't require you to do that for every shot.  I recommend setting the photos to Vivid or More Vivid.  Contrary to popular perception, I found these settings actually give you a more accurate color portrayal of the scene.3.  I use the D40 with the 18-200mm Nikon VR lens.  They work great in combination.4.  Changing settings is quick and easy even though many are not set with dedicated buttons.5.  I like the way you can review a series of photos zoomed in, and the camera keeps the same zoomed in setting for each photo -- just turn the rear wheel.6.  Camera has a high quality feel.7.

I was into 35 mm SLR photography 20+ years ago.  I got back into photography with the new digitals but held off on digital SLRs because they were expensive, but more importantly, so large.  Not so the D40 on either count.  I compared the D40 side by side with the Canon Rebel XTi (EOS 400D in Europe) at a photo store.  The XTi was slightly bigger.  The XTi beat the D40 in features (it had more pixels, and more features, including the self-cleaning sensor and was a little faster) although it was more expensive.  But in the end, I chose the D40 because it just felt better in my hand.  My hands are medium sized and it fit very well.  The Canon just wasn't as comfortable.  Plus the overall build quality seemed better than the Canon and the sound of the shutter and flash pop-up was softer, more subdued, more quality sounding (and important for photographing wildlife or a sleeping baby).  And the final selling point for me with the Nikon D40 was the view-finder was noticeably brighter than the XTi.  If you are stepping up to an SLR from a point-and-shoot, this is the camera to do it with at about the same price-point as a good non-SLR digital.  You can finally get away from that annoying lag between button push and picture capture.  It's not the fastest SLR out there but I have been very happy with it, finally actually capturing those shots within a split-second of pushing the button, though it slows down somewhat in low-light situations.  It takes continuous shots at 2.5 frames per second in good light, which though again not stellar, is adequate for most situations.  The 2.5 inch LCD screen is incredible - bright and clear.  It has an excellent menu with built-in context sensitive help screens at the touch of a button.  Though it doesn't have as many features as it's much more expensive big brothers, and the 6mp max capability is a limitation, it is adequate for all but professional users, and there will be plenty of professionals buying one as a small back-up.  It's not the megapixels that matter as much as the quality of the picture and the D40 doesn't disappoint there either - clear, sharp, excellent colors (it has the same image processor as the D80 and D200).  There are a number of pre-set auto modes easily selected by the main dial that also work well.  The built in flash does a fine job and I have seen no red-eye. One feature I like is the auto-ISO that you can set to only kick in at a certain shutter speed or slower.  It also has a D-light feature which allows you to enhance an already-taken back-lit or shadowy picture in-camera to even out the shadows and highlights; it works very well.  Two features that it doesn't have that I wish it did are f-stop bracketing and depth of field preview.  I have been satisfied with the battery life so far, though it does use a different Li-ion battery than the other Nikons so you can't cross-use your batteries if you already have a different model Nikon DSLR. The 18-55 kit lens is nice - light and small but quality construction (version II - nicer than the first one that came with the D50 that seemed lower quality).  If you read technical reviews on the lens it is a solid performer for the price.  You won't be able to use most older Nikon auto-focus lenses in auto-focus mode since this has no built-in auto-focus motor (not at this size and weight!).  It requires AF-S and AF-I lenses, so most of the prime lenses will be manual focus only.  This is a small price to pay I think for a small light-weight camera.  If you already are into digital SLR, the D40 is still a great camera, making for an excellent travel camera since it's small, light-weight and you aren't carrying around a two thousand dollar hunk of expensive hardware.  I am very satisfied with it; it is an excellent value - and offers something for the novice and pro alike.  It makes me really want to carry this with me all the time and get out and take pictures again.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Don't get a D50 or D80 over a D40", "Author": "Donald Miles \"don in PA\"", "ReviewID": "R3OLG3333LUYMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't follow the advice in some of these reviews that you have to get a Nikon D50 or D80 instead of the wonderful Nikon D40 (which I've had for almost a year and taken thousands of pix on):The D40 is barely half the price of a D80 and has better controls, is lighter/smaller, and takes photos the equal of any you can get on the D80.The D50 is virtually off the market and has nothing substantial that the D40 hasn't (except the ability to use autofocus with AF/non-AF-S older lenses).The inability to use autofocus with older AF lenses is no big deal: they still auto-expose and you can still focus them manually. Besides, with the great 18-55mm kit lens that comes with the D40 (all the lens most casual photographers will need) or the wonderful 18-200mm VR (expensive, but able to replace virtually every lens you'll ever want), you really wouldn't want to use those old AF lenses anyway, for almost any shot.If you really need the few things that the D40 lacks (better metering, better color, better Auto ISO, faster sequential shots), spend more for the D200, a professional camera (the D200 is only a little more than the D80 -- which is no better than the D40 -- so why get a D80?).Ignore reviews that try to put down the D40 as an \"entry level DSLR\" or a somehow lacking in what's necessary to take 99% of the photos you'll ever take: it's a great, inexpensive, wonderful to use tool for taking great photographs.

If you are in the 5 star group, you will LOVE the D40.  But . . . because of a decision Nikon made to save $$$ by leaving out an autofocus driver out of the camera body, if you want to add a lens to shoot your kid playing soccer, the D40 is a very bad choice, and you may be a dead man walking. Let me explain:The 5 Star buyer:If you are moving up to a digital SLR, and want nothing more than to use the kit lens (which is very good), then you will LOVE this camera: it is light, feels good in the hand, and puts out better looking JPEG files than the more expensive D70 and D50 cameras.  If you intend to use this camera for general travel and around-the-house kid pictures, the D40 is a great choice, and I think you will be very, very happy.The 1 Star buyer:You want a camera for sports or telephoto shots of nature.  This is not the camera for you, and here is why:  the D40 has a DIFFERENT lens mount than every other Nikon DSLR which came before it.  To save costs, Nikon left an autofocus driver out of the camera body, which means you must buy special/more expensive add-on lenses with the autofocus driver built into the lens itself.Why is this significant? Because of the 200 lenses made for Nikon DSLRs by Nikon, Sigma, Tokina, and others, only 20 or so work with the D40 with autofocus - something most amateurs will need to shoot sports and day to day photos. Many of Nikon's own consumer grade lenses, such as the 70-300mm G Zoom (Street price $150), will not autofocus with the D40.  As a practical matter, this means that if you want an autofocus lens to shoot junior playing soccer, you must spend $525 for a zoom lens, the fantastic, yet pricey Nikon 70-300mm VR Zoom.  That is almost as much as what you paid for the camera itself.  The D40 is significantly limited in the number of lenses it will accept, and you really need to think about these limitations before purchasing. Moreover, what if your intentions change and want to pick up a cheap zoom for occasional use? With the D40, you can't, and I really think this is a significant limitation on this camera.But hey, if you are in group 1, this is a 5 star purchase, and you will be a very happy camper. Good luck!P.S. - In April, 2007, Nikon will begin selling the D40x, the same camera with an upgraded 10 megapixel sensor for $800 w/ lens.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "A real winner and a wonderful introductory digital SLR", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "RCC4RO986SBZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good job, Nikon!  The D40 is an ideal entry level DSLR.  It is aimed at persons who want better quality images than a point-and-shoot pocket camera can deliver, who are willing to put up with the somewhat extra bulk of a true SLR, but who do not want to spend a lot more money.  The D40 is an outrageous bargain at its price point.  Only a tad bit more money than the high-end point-and-shoots, the D40 will produce better images with the kit lens, and more importantly, enables the user to expand the capacity of the camera at will, by buying other Nikon and compatible lenses.  Or by equipping the D40 with one of Nikon's superb outboard flash units, such as the SB400, SB600, or SB800.  You cannot do that with point-and-shoots.Thus, it is a mistake, in my opinion, to spend a lot of time comparing the D40 to other DSLRs, because its real competition is the top-end point-and-shoot cameras, which are pretty good these days.  Nevertheless, I will point out some of the advantages and disadvantages of the D40 vis'a'vis other low-end digital SLR cameras.First-price.  The D40 gives a lot of bang for the buck compared to any other DSLR on the market.  Particularly for folks for whom its price is a bit of a stretch, the D40 is a howling bargain, in my estimation.Second-ergonomics.  Nikon got the D40 just right.  It fits in one's hand in a solid and agreeable way.  This is a camera most people will not mind carrying around all day.  It is small, but has a wonderful \"quality\" feel that Nikon seems to get right more often than other manufacturers.  The menus are pretty good.  Yes, I miss the top LCD display (the D40 uses the big rear LCD for this information, to cut costs) but once you get used to it, it is OK.  The control layout on this camera will appeal to most users.Downsides: the focusing system is less advanced than either the D70s or D50, with three focus points.  This may annoy some purists, but the user group to whom the D40 is aimed will mostly not mind this.  The other downside is that the D40 does not have the built-in bayonet mount motor, which means that it can only autofocus with the newer Nikon lenses which have the motor in the lens.  The older lenses will be autofocus only.  In reality I doubt that many will mind this, as the targeted user group for the D40 will likely not own any older Nikon lenses, and will simply confine their subsequent purchases to the newer lenses.  Lastly, the D40 is 6 megapixels (in common with the D50 and D70s) rather than the 10MP of the superb D80 and D200.  This is probably not going to be a big deal to many D40 owners.  You can take awesome pictures at 6MP, the differences as between 6 and 10MP are subtle, and not likely to make a difference to most users.The D40 is a wonderful choice for someone who wants to be able to take high-quality digital photographs and take advantage of the Nikon system of lenses and flashes, but does not want to spend the kind of money involved in the higher-end cameras.  And the wonderful thing is, that if you buy a D40 and get hooked on photography, the D40 can grow with you for quite a ways, since it can use the high-end Nikon equipment.  And if you do upgrade the camera body, all the extra lenses and flashes will work with the higher-end model.  This makes the D40 an excellent choice for many.Nikon put a lot of thought in the design of the D40, and by doing so they produced an excellent product for a bargain price.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "FAR MORE CAMERA THAN YOU WILL EVER REALLY COMPREHEND AT A QUICKLY DROPPING COST", "Author": "C. Scanlon \"least helpful reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R2H1KP3KSTU9YT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I began as a child with brownies and graduated to instamatics, wondering at the wonderful new technology and the convenience of a contained drop in roll of film and a cool flash. In high school I progressed to dark room processing (whose magic and science later served me in a sweltering subtropical environment), but still with the most basic of cameras unless a friend lent me his Mamiya Seikor and hand held light meter. I have an old soviet all mechanical KGB 35 mm SLR camera laying around somewhere, but my main camera which became like a part of me, another organ of my body, was my Canon AL-1, with the wonders of a rudimentary Focus assist system and aperture priority photography. That Canon saw me across thousands of miles through Nicaragua and the heights of Machu Picchu, and finally gave up the ghost when twenty years came and went and duct tape couldn't hold it together anymore and the long lens fused to the body.Being known as a photographer, or one who has taken pictures, has its draw backs, as people ask you about the latest technology. In the mountains of NIcaragua in the eighties new tourists asked me how their latest point and shoot knew which ISO to set to. I had no idea. More recently people handed me their digital point and shoots, tiny as cellphones, and I had no idea and a lingering commitment to a roll of film as true photography, and a full sized SLR as the only way to go. I cannot grasp the concept of parallax which point and shoots require, but must compose in the viewfinder as I cannot control the darkroom with commercial and color film processing.Then I met this D-40Being obliged to buy a digital as the price of film processing soared, I searched desperately here on the amazon, feeling unfaithful, comparing product details, etc. which are so generously given here on the amazon, and I discovered: This D-40 is all of the camera you will ever need forever, case closed (Of course I felt the same about my Canon).I now once again sleep with my SLR literally, and its manual I commit to memory. This camera is really more than you will ever need, and since it is behind the latest wave its price is very reasonable and generous. The number of megapixels is more than sufficient for enlargement, and for cropping to details while recomposing. In fact, the camera is its own darkroom, as it allows you to crop and otherwise alter and adjust all aspects of images, including going sepia tones, and dump them to a printer or your computer, without the need for further graphics programs. The full functions of the camera quickly become intuitive, with its easily accessible and ergonomic buttons and switches and menu screens, and as one who used no more than a mainly mechanical SLR for years and loved it, this D-40 is truly magical and well beyond my needs, desires and imaginings. It can do everything and more.I strongly suggest you get the very inexpensive 55-200 mm long lens designed for this camera series. Watch for the full description of the lens to be sure it is fully compatible with all of this camera's features. And before going outside, as you learned in your first photogrpahy class, be sure to get the UV lens filter, or other filter, mainly to protect the lens from scratches and the world and your fingertip oils. Be sure to get the semi-soft camera case which is ample enough to cover the surprisingly short long lens. Also hunt around for the best price on SD memory cards, of which you will want several, and which are very inexpensive here on the amazon. If you can afford it get an extra rechargeable battery to carry in your case, and get the plug in transformer for use where plug in is available and long service is required. Pick up the remote control device and all the rest of the bells and whistles while available, but essentially get the long lens, lens filters, SD cards, and semi soft case. Also get a great all around technique refresher book like Understanding Exposure (see my review there please).One surprisingly expensive accessory is the Speedlight flash attachment. I got sticker shock at seeing the price on these nowadays, for one that angles, etc. We used to get these used for next to nothing, but now I'd get another lens instead! In any case the built in pop-up flash on the D-40 serves for most any flash situations without being annoying and with a red eye assist, etc., even at a good distance (ever seen those folks at a football game stand up and try to fill the stadium with their disposable flash or their CELLPHONE? Or stand more than twelve feet away?).I normally go with ambient light no matter how long the exposure, for the suffused effect, and so rarely use a flash. So I was glad to learn the flash can be suppressed in the \"fully automatic no flash\" mode, as well as other modes, but having it there to pop up whenever people require you to \"take my picture\" under unfavorable conditions is very comforting. This is a great all around camera with also wonderfully implemented specific skills.The only con mentioned elsewhere that I can agree with is regarding the three point automatic focus system which focusses on the nearest object. I lean on the law of thirds myself and so have to lock focus and recompose in the viewfinder, or think of cropping later. Obviously the focussing points were set up to favor the exact center, which is death to any photograph. But hey, work around this already!You cannot go wrong with this camera. Did I mention the ample rear screen, full color, which permits zooming in very closely to check your focus, etc., and which scrolls through several functional menu screens? It has everything and more, including settings for aperture priority (and even if you do not have a manual aperture ring on your lens, you can do it through the camera itself), shutter priority, etc. etc. etc. If you feel there is something this camera CANNOT do, as mentioned in other reviews, just READ THE MANUAL (we used to have an interesting acronym for that in the early days of PC's) and you will discover this camera in fact can do it all and more.You can set this up so that every iota of information regarding focal length, shutter speed, aperture, etc., etc., gets saved with the photo instead of jotting it down in a pad, and thus you can even see that the ISO is altered automatically to fit conditions. No more blowing off a roll of 100 ISO before nightfall just to take low light pictures by oil lamp with ISO 800 and using it up before daybreak. You can also set the ISO instead of automatically switching it from shot to shot as the camera wills.I have not yet tried setting the ISO to 1600 to see if it comes out as ethereally grainy as that film did when first marketted twenty years ago. Got some great shots of people and places that way. I suppose in the DSLR it simply grants greater latitude in low light situations without flash. But I see no pressing need to have a button dedicated directly and only to adjusting ISO as mentioned in another review. I trust the D-40's processor to make the decision. That's what I pay it for. Me, I am too concerned with keeping those kids in focus and in frame, or that wild bird from spooking to soon, or that flower from getting lost in too great a depth of field, or holding my breath while soaking in that altar lit by candles and wishing I had brought my tripod, or at least a monopod.Truly this is the camera to get, especially at this falling price, but be sure to protect it with lens filters and case, and READ THE MANUAL!!", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "More than enough camera for most people.", "Author": "Gerry", "ReviewID": "R3NZOOXTWHLFR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave the D40 5 stars for solid build quality, outstanding images and bargin price tag.---In the dim and distant past I owned a number of film SLRs, but for the past 5 or 6 years I've  only used point and shoot digital cameras.  Lately, the shutter lag in these cameras became increasingly annoying, and the slow startup resulted in missing some priceless moments. A new,  point 'n shoot would have been faster, but given the drop in price, a digital SLR was a much better option, plus I wanted to get back into taking photography a bit more seriously.  So, here is how I came to buy a Nikon D40.....I now completely agree with the advice given in many of the reviews in almost all 'camera review' web sites. You really need get an SLR camera in your hands before you know if it is `right' for you. A camera with awesome specifications is useless if you are going to leave it at home because its too heavy, or if it feels so fragile you are afraid you might damage it. When I picked up the Canon D30 and similar mid-range cameras I immediately came to the conclusion I'd probably only use them on `special occasions', like a wedding, or when I was specifically going going some where to take photos. They are pretty heavy, probably more at home in a studio than being taken hiking! So, that left the `cheaper' end of the range (since cheaper SLRs generally means smaller and lighter). Some were immediately out of the running because of their small, dark viewfinders. The olympus range for example, was notable for the claustrophobic tunnel of a viewfinder. I did consider the Pentax range, but if I were to really get into photography, and decided I needed a camera with more 'professional' features, it  would likely be a Nikon or a Canon. Consequently, I decided to limit my choice to one of these manufacturers, since I want to be able to use accessories and lenses that I buy now on future camera bodies. That really only left the Canon XTi and the Nikon D40. The Canon undoubtedly has the higher spec, but the camera  doesn't quite fit my hand. Its too small to be comfortable. The Nikon however, fits perfectly. This left the choice between the 10M pixel D40x at $800 or the 6M pixel D40 at $550. Almost all of the photos I take are for display on a computer - either on the web, or on my own monitor. When I do print photos I never print anything bigger than a 10 x 8. So, realistically, I wouldn't gain anything  from the extra pixels (other than some vague notion that I'd done the `right thing' by purchasing the `better' model). I decided to go with the lower end model, especially since I've never been pixel limited with my current 5 M pixel point `n shoot, and spend the difference on a Nikon 55-200mm VR zoom (at $230 this is also a bargin).Bottom line. The D40 is a great deal. The D40x is less so. At $800, the D40x is lacking in features - such as being able to use any Nikon lens and have autofocus capability, no depth of field preview, etc. I feel like I got an incredible deal on this camera, and couldn't be happier with the images it produces.-----Update:  I've now taken about 3,000 photos with this camera.  And, I'm  even happier than I was when I first bought it.  Its light enough that I carry it with me every day.  And, as a result, I've taken many photos that I'd otherwise missed.November 2007.  I dropped the camera onto tarmac.  It was in it's bag, so it didn't hit the ground particularly hard.  But, it was hard enough to damage the kit lens.  It still works, but the zoom movement is now very stiff in one direction.  I'd been thinking about buying a 55-200VR lens to supplement the kit lens that came with the camera.  Instead, I've just ordered an 18-200 VR lens from amazon.  I'd been in two minds about buying this, and always having the right lens on the camera when the opportunity arose.

(I looked into a DSLR camera for a full year.) I knew going into this that there were several \"down\" sides to the D40. I know about the limited choice of lenses. I know that I can't have a bunch of flashes set up like a studio. I know that it is small. But those were not downs for me at all. First of all, I was moving up from a point and shoot. I have never owned an SLR camera before. I have no old lenses to worry about. In fact, when I first got this, my only goal was to get a great camera that takes fantastic pictures with no shutter lag. And the D40 did not disappointment.Right out of the box, it took the most awesome pictures.  The manual is great, and very easy to follow and understand.  The LCD monitor is large, and the menus are well organized.  I had originally not planned on getting any other lenses.  I changed my mind, and was saddened at how expensive the AF-S lenses are.  I am thrilled the Nikon came out with a 55-200 AF-S VR zoom.  I was going to wait for them to make a prime 50mm lens, but went ahead and got it now anyway.  It was not that difficult to learn, although I can see it will take time to master.  Yes, I have to manually focus the lens. But you know what? I can do it! A total newbie who is taking awesome pictures!!! What more can you ask for in a camera?I am also a woman, and I have smaller hands than the average guy. (Hey, even my teen age son has bigger hands than me.) The camera feels great in my hands. In fact, that is what sold me on it. I held the Nikon D50, the Pentax camera, and the Sony camera. I really wanted image stabilization.  In the end, I held them all in my hand, and the Nikon was the smallest.  It did not feel heavy, and the grip was more comfortable.  My hand does get a little cramped after taking a lot of pictures when I have my big lens and flash on. (I am talking about the 18-200mm VR lens. It feels heavy to me, although I am told that it is not that heavy.)If you have a P & S camera, and are looking to move up to a digital SLR camera, this is the one for you.  It would also be perfect for someone who already owns a \"big\" dSLR and wants something smaller.  Not only is the price fantastic, it continues to drop. I had a chance to change this one in for the newer D40x, but decided I didn't need 4 more megapixels. In fact, I got a code for a free 16 x 20 poster from Shutterfly for buying my camera from Amazon. I took a picture of my kids, and cropped it by about 40%, and the poster was FANTASTIC. Sharp, clear, and I lost nothing in the process. This is truly an amazing camera; I love mine and I am thrilled to finally be getting the kind of results I have wanted. Sharp pictures, bright, vivid colors, and no shutter lag!

It has all the basic features you'd expect (listed quite well by the staff at Amazon), so let me go into comparisons with other cameras.First and foremost, the D40 lacks the focusing motor built into the body of the camera (like all previous Nikon DSLRs).  Instead, it must have a motor built into the lens (Nikon calls these type \"Silent Wave\" or AF-S), otherwise, you lose autofocusing.  While Nikon offers several AF-S lenses, they offer only a handful under $1,000.  Additionally, the D40 will only be available in the US with the 18-55 kit, and most the other lenses under $1,000 over lap very much with this lens.  Tamron and Tokina currently offer NO lenses with the motor built-in for Nikon cameras, and Sigma only offers a very few.  If you want a zoom going to 300mm any time soon, be prepared to shell out about $600 for Nikon's new 70-300VR lens if you require autofocus.  It promises to be a very nice lens, but you can get a basic Canon or Sony 75-300 for a bit over $200.  Thus, if your considering the D40 because you have a bag full of Nikon AF lenses, then you might instead look at the soon to be disappearing D50.Compared to other Nikon DSLRs, the D40 is much smaller, very similar to the Canon Digital Rebel XTi.  While this results in a smaller, lighter camera, it also means it will have some of the same drawbacks that many Nikon owners have teased Rebel owners.  The camera will have a smaller grip; a smaller, less powerful battery; will lose the top info LCD and use the rear 2.5\" screen instead; and, the feature Nikon users typically point to when they refer to \"ergonomics\" is the viewfinder.  While the D80 has a .94x viewfinder, the D40 matches the smaller .80x of the XTi.The autofocusing points will also drop to 3, with 5 being the previous low on a Nikon DSLR.The D40 will do very well, especially since Canon & Sony aren't currently offering a lower cost, 6 megapixel camera.  The directly comparable camera would be Pentax's K110D, which retails for about $550 with lens and after rebate.  It uses the same 6 megapixel sensor supplies by Sony as the D40.  A bit heavier, is uses 4 AA batteries instead of the LithiumIon.  I prefer the latter, but there are many fans of the inexpensive AA NiMH rechargables.  The viewfinder is also larger, and has a very nice 11 point AF system.  Pentax also offers the more popular K100D, which is the same as the K110D, but with SR (\"Shake Reduction\") built into the camera body.  This retails, after rebate, for about $50 more than the D40.So the D40 will be a very nice camera for the budding photographer, but not necessarily a good upgrade for current Nikon owners.

First and foremost was budget. I only have one lens for the FG (the basic one) so lens compatibility really wasn't an issue. The body style and weight was also important, as was the type of memory card (my laptop has a built-in SD card reader.On a trip to a local camera shop, I tried out several makes and models. Some of them I picked up, and set back down before even taking a test shot. (A couple of models use AA batteries and are REALLY heavy!)

I understand that the D40 takes a special lens in order to use autofocus, and the type of add on flash is limited as well.

This camera suits my needs NOW... and probably will for a long time.I took over 200 pictures on Christmas Day with this camera.

Goochee", "ReviewID": "RKZOVPQ9CXHJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to all of the earlier reviewers who guided me to this camera as my first SLR camera !!!  I received the camera with the standard 18-55 lense, and also purchased the 55-200 lense, less than a week in advance of one of those once-in-a-lifetime vacations -- 10 days in Peru.The camera and its controls are very intuitive.  The camera with the standard lense is very easy to handle.  I took about 800 photos in 10 days (with just one battery re-charge !!).  The quality of the photos is amazing.  The 18-55 lense was the lense of choice for 95% of my photos -- indoor shots, photos of family members, and vistas.  The 55-200 lense (which has a potential for up to about 3.6X zoom) was useful when I wanted to get closeups of people and animals without being physically close to them -- e.g., taking pictures of indigenous people at a respectful distance, or photographing a distant llama.)  On this vacation, I didn't ever feel that I needed more than the 3.6X zoon capability of the 55-200 lense.The full Automatic (point-and-shoot) mode on the camera makes EXCELLENT decisions for photos that require the flash.  The Aperature-control mode results in amazing portrait photos at low aperature settings.The problems I had with the camera were relatively minor.  In the full Automatic mode with the camera's default settings, the camera has a lot of trouble getting the correct light exposure for outside shots -- photos tend to be overexposed and lose bright highlights -- for example, clouds and other white highlights are saturated -- that is, are presented as pure white, with no potential for later correction via computer.  This was correctable by operating in the \"P\" mode, and correcting the exposure using an \"EV\" setting of -1/3 to -1.7.Another small problem:  On a bright sunny day, it is hard to see the photos on the rear-camera display -- e.g., to know whether the exposure is correct for the shot you've just taken.  But, the camera has an excellent \"histogram\" feature that permits you to quickly judge whether you have the correct EV setting, even if you can't make out the details of the picture on the display.Another small problem:  In the full Automatic mode on a cloudy day (with the camera's default settings), the camera seemed to have trouble with the color brown.  Thus, brown adobe huts and the brown grown came out as grey.  This was fully correctable by setting the \"lighting\" compensation setting on the camera to \"shade\".Perhaps as I get more familiar with the camera, I will learn other ways to get around these problems, as the camera has many settings and and controls that I haven't explored yet.  Or, perhaps I will learn that I created these problems for myself !!  The main point is that it was very easy to figure out fixes to each problem I encountered, and obtain the best photos I every taken.So, not to lose sight of the main message, this is a great first SLR camera for a person who has only used point-and-shoot cameras previously.  My two daughters were using new $250-$350 Sony and Cannon point-and-shoot cameras on the trip, and they also had outstanding indoor photos and outdoor family closeup photos.  However, their cameras were no match for the Nikon D40 in terms of the full range of photo opportunities, including vistas, portraits, and action photographs of people/animals, etc.The Nikon D40 can do everything a point-and-shoot camera can do, but then provide the flexibility to get great photos in situations where the limitations of point-and-shoot become evident.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nikon D40", "Author": "Thomas G.

I was especially annoyed by red-eye problems and with the relatively poor workmanship of the cameras despite their high price.

I tried a Canon S3 IS and I love the 12x zoom lens (SD200 and 600 are only 3x). However the lens is as slow as SD200/600 even the high ISO performance is a *little* better. Another thing is the color tune of that particular S3 IS is way too cold.(The following is mainly a comparison of Canon Rebel XTi and Nikon D40)Then I tried a Canon Rebel XTi (EOS 400) - a good step up from point&shoot; cameras. However the big hassle is that in P mode (which I believe most of people use with DSLR cameras), you have to choose ISO for each shooting situation. This is not very practical when you just want to quickly catch a moment. D40 (and D70/80) has the very very useful \"AUTO ISO\" here - it allows you set a Max ISO # (I'm using 1600) and shutter sheep and the camera will adjust the ISO accordingly in this preset range - in P mode. I found the pictures in 1600 are quite satisfactory - even though everyone else is saying Canon EOS has better high ISO performance. Also D40 is lighter and more compact than Canon EOS. I like the command dial of Nikon better - Canon's is too tight and locates at the front - means you have to life up your finger from the shutter button each time you want to use it. D40's at the back so is very accessible with your thumb. Yes Canon has more hardware buttons. But D40 has enough - I use the Fn button for white balance. ISO is not longer needed thanks to the Auto ISO. Then pretty much that's what I need in 90% of shoot situation. Of course more buttons are better - but hey - D40 is $540 and Canon XTi is $780!I have had my Canon for almost 3 months but still can't decide to keep it.  D40 was received just a few days ago and now I love it! I like how it feels in my hand and the picture quality. Besides, there are better lens options for Nikon. The good lens for Canons are too expensive.  The kits lens of D40 is the second generation of its 18-55 and is said better than Canon's kit lens. Nikon's 55-200 is only $170. The legendary 18-200 f/3.5-5 (with image stabilization) is only $750 (if you can get hold of one).The only down side of D40 for me is it only takes AF-S/I lens so the famous 50MM F/1.8 prime lens won't auto focus on it. I wish I could get one of those really fast lens to use indoors. I believe/hope Nikon will make a compatible cheap prime for D40 in the future.D40 is 6MP but Canon is 10 MP. I'm OK with it because most of the pictures are viewed at computer. 6 MP is more then enough already.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me", "Author": "Pgh, PA", "ReviewID": "R388X052JVP0S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am the D40 demographic.  I came from a Canon point and shoot, I previously owned no SLR lenses, and mainly wanted to take high quality photos of my family.  The D40 has fit the bill perfectly, allowing me to easily take beautiful photographs.  Here are some points that prospective buyers may want to consider:1. 6MP resolution.  10.1 MP is the current rage, but examine your needs before you buy these cameras.  File size, especially if you shoot in RAW, for 10.1 MP is huge and the increase in print size allowed with the higher resolution is not that significant in a real world way.  For me, the D40 provides plenty of real world resolution without getting caught up in the Megapixel war.2. Auto-ISO.  This is key.  See the review below.3. ISO 1600 shooting. If you are not into looking at every photo with a magnifying glass (and who does that?), the high quality of these photos will allow you to get great pictures that you otherwise would miss.4.Before buying the camera, I owned no SLR lenses.  If you own a buch of lenses already, this camera is probably not for you (unless the happen to be of the correct type).5. Easy adjustability.  Shooting with aperature or speed priority is very, very easy.6. Lack of second information LCD.  I looked at the D80 and thought I would miss that second display on the D40.  Well, the D80 info display is pretty poor anyway and on the D40 all that info is a push of the button away.  Maybe a bit of a negative, but not as much as I thought it would be.7. No depth of field preview.  A common complaint about this camera.  If you don't know what this is, then don't worry about it.  If you have to have this feature, look elsewhere.In summary, this is a real world camera for the every day photographer that wants great photos and the speed and adjustability of an SLR.  If you are deciding between this camera and the D80, get out a sheet of paper and write down all the ways the D80 will help you get a better photograph.  Then make the decision and see if the extra cost is worth the price difference.

The first time I saw it was at Best Buy.  It felt nice, looked nice and had a fantastic LCD.  From there I knew I wanted to buy it.  The camera is one of the most affordably priced Digital SLR's on the market today.  The one caveat to that statement is its only very affordable if the kit lens suits your needs.  I personally take a lot of pictures of small items so the kit lens does not do the trick.  I had to upgrade to a Nikon Macro lens which is very good but added $400 to the price of the camera for me.  The cameras picture quality is fantastic and being able to switch back and forth from manual to automatic focusing is a great feature.  The screen is big and bright and the camera is very responsive.  There are tons of settings on the camera so that you can really get any type of photo you are looking for.  One accessory I really recommend buying with the camera is the wireless remote.  Its only $17 and can prove to be very useful in a wide array of situations.  The sole downside to this camera (and every single other digital SLR in its class) is that there is no live preview on the LCD.

Instead, let's concentrate on how it actually works.First, I wanted a DSLR because they are easier for me to use than point and shoots and of course there are choices with lenses, flashes, etc. I chose Nikon because I have had good luck durability-wise with that brand and Nikon is obviously a premier company. I also have a couple of interesting old Nikon lenses that are usable. Amazon's price with free shipping and all was quite a bit less than I found locally. It arrived quickly and in good shape, as did the extra stuff I got for it.One of these items was the 55-200 VR zoom. If you go this route BEWARE: there are cheap zoom packages that ship the NON-VR version. You want VR.Surely the standard kit lens, which does get excellent reviews, will itself someday be offered in VR form. In fact, since I bought this, you can be sure this will be soon!Some reviewers have advised the use of those impressive bigger, heavier, wider aperture and more costly lenses. Or prime lenses. My take is that the standard DX lenses that were designed for this camera just make it so much more pleasurable to use, work just fine and are appropriate for the use this camera will get. If there are any differences in quality, they are really hard to see, if at all.VR makes low-light photos sharp and in many cases negates the need for wide aperture lenses, and this also means a better depth of field. However, nothing beats big expensive lenses, or big expensive most anything else, actually. It just isn't really necessary for most of the photography people will use this camera for.Cameras like the D40 are best for candid, quick shots and for capturing moments in time that are not repeatable. Bulky equipment just gets in the way and makes it more likely that the camera will be in the closet and not with you.Some people just like the photog life and live to carry around the biggest and heaviest stuff. My thinking is that the $5000 and more DSLRs with their bigger sensors and all would be more appropriate for that use, or  spend $35000 and really go for it with a digital Hasselblad.Why not the D40x? I read a zillion reviews that said, in essence, that you can't tell the difference, so why spend the extra? There is a lot of debate about this, but I went with the D40.Some experts, including those that I admire, suggest using special settings, especially those that have to do with how vivid the colors will be. And there are plenty of these settings. I spent a lot of time trying the various manual modes and other shooting options. Just delete them when you are done experimenting. Go to the menu on that big bright and sharp screen and reset when you are done. I messed up some promising shots because I assumed I was in Auto mode and I wasn't. My bad; automatic or not, you still have to pay attention.This is all fun to play with, and, speaking of auto mode, it is pretty darn good. Just set the top dial to auto, leave it there, press half-way down on the shutter button to focus and then fire away. Make sure the lens buttons are set on VR and auto focus. All good.And there are other settings for landscapes, portraits, kids, etc. Again, it is easy to turn the dial to those settings and it is all automatic. The camera's little computer changes things in subtle ways to complement those shots.Nikon has vast technical resources and I figure they have this stuff figured out better than me. If you want special effects, you can do that, but the auto modes are really very good and hard to beat.Flash is fun. The pop-up flash works very well for most any normal use. I also bought the little 400 series add-on flash. This is a nice device that has a bounce feature. The D40 handles all this flash stuff perfectly. Very nice, and automatic.What about the plastic construction of the camera and the DX lenses? Sure, nothing better than those precise old metal beauties, but the DX cameras are all about size and weight. They are molded to be easy to hold and use and I really have no complaints. The camera and lenses are well-built and solid. I keep my old FM-2 around to fondle.What about the complaints that many of the old Nikon lenses will not work on the D40? This won't be a problem for new users because they will just buy DX lenses. If you do have a collection of fabulous old lenses, then it would be best to go up to D80s or the 300. Check on what actually works. The extra cost of the camera will be offset by the \"free\" lenses. This will be especially important if you have specialty lenses like perspective control, medical, etc.Again, the whole idea of the D40 is that it is light, small and affordable. Sticking a multi-pound lens on it sort of defeats the purpose.I do have two old lenses, a 55mm micro-nikkor macro and a 100-300 with a macro setting. I just set the aperture on a guess, check out the results on the screen and adjust again. These old lenses were made to be manually set, so it is easy to do. Not for fast shots, no VR, but fun to play with.And the results, the actual prints? First, let me say that I am a fan of big contact prints. Nothing else looks sharp to me. A Leica sales guy showed me a big print, around 24\" wide, printed to show how good a cost is no object Leica could be. Ahh, sharp for what it was, but just sort of ok for me.I have had a lot of 35mm printed and was always disappointed. Even paid extra at expensive camera stores. All in the 4X6 to 8X10 size. Not that good, to me. Slides were better, but what a pain to view.Frankly, despite 35mm supposedly being equivalent to 25 mp digital, my 6mp photos printed out on my Canon Pixma are just a lot nicer. Nicer colors, sharper, better. Maybe if I sent my 35mm shot out to be printed on ultra exotic media with processing to match... too much for me.If you can, I suggest getting your digital files out to a service that prints them out on actual photo paper on mega-expensive machines. This is  very inexpensive and provides ultimate results (reasonably speaking).I download into iPhoto on my old iBook. When I connect the included usb cable, the program recognizes the camera and the download begins when I push \"import\". Then, if I want to play with the photo, I just drag it into Adobe Elements, do my best, then save it back to iPhoto for storage. I do not use Nikon's software because I don't need to.The D40 does do some processing in the camera, but I am just used to using  the computer. It is easier to see on a big screen and of course the photo editing programs give you many more options. There are all sorts of very capable programs to sort and manipulate your photos if you want to go that way.Suggested options: I went with the kit lens and the 55-200 VR (see my review on that lens) and that is not a bad combination. A better one would be the wide zoom and the 18-200 VR. That, however, is $2K worth of lenses. I got the little remote. I am a fan of polarizing filters, but I already had one.Digital cameras are especially good at macro work and Nikon offers a new macro lens and a neat special flash system to go with it. Not cheap, but super capable and the results are great.I do not like the D40's limitations on remote triggering and remote flash. To fire off the camera you can use that nifty little remote, but the sensor for it is on the front of the camera. Fine for most uses where you are in front of the camera, but heck, a timer works for that. These cameras do not accept cable releases. I will try to make a reflector out of aluminum foil and see if that works.The old Nikon D70 had the capability of triggering remote flashes. That was a neat feature. With the D40 you have to buy one of Nikon's more expensive flashes, or a triggering device. I would like to try some creative flash photography, but the cost is pretty high. Too bad.Note that UPS will call you the day before because they want you to be there for delivery. Too small and expensive to just leave on the porch. You might want it delivered to your work.Also, be aware that it does not come with the little flash memory card, so order one at the same time. I got the Sandisk Ultra II 2.0 gb. It seems to work just fine. It is a brand that Nikon recommends, so...The D40 is easy to use, light and capable for any normal situation. It downloads easily and the photos are as good as current technology allows in this price range.

While it certainly can be easily used by novices in automatic mode, I soon realized that the camera has almost all the capabilities of higher-end Nikons, such as the D50, D70 and D80, but in a smaller and lighter version and even with some features the more expensive cameras are lacking.Although light and relatively small, the D40 seems solidly built and the shape and controls are well thought out. The rear viewing screen is large and bright and the (through the lens) viewfinder is bright as well. When pressing the shutter button half way down you can clearly see when the subject is in focus. There is an extensive and well designed menu systemwith which you can customize your camera and there is a \"Help Button\" thatbrings up clear explanations as to what each menu item is for and what it does.The camera takes excellent photos in all modes. What impresses me most is the lack of noise at high ISO settings. You get excellent results indoors without using flash at ISO 1600 and with very little noise. When using the pop-up flash, results are consistently good in macro and fill-in modes. Like all pop-up flashes, the range is limited and my next purchase will be a more powerful external flash. (Actually the range of the built-in flash is higher than most because of the high ISO usability.)The kit lens is quite decent for most situations. A professional or serious photographer may want to invest in a more expensive lens, preferably one with 'Image Stabilization'. Unfortunately older Nikon lenses and even newer ones not designed for this camera cannot be used except possibly in complete manual mode, and that can be awkward at best. At under $600.- The Nikon D40 is a great value. While the camera sports only 6 megapixels, that is more than adequate for most photographers. Nikon just came out with the D40X camera that has 10 Megapixels which otherwise is almost identical to the D40.

Maybe people just like to hear (or see) themselves talk.I own a few digital cameras (Nikon D40, D80, D300).I will give you a few quick points as to why you should purchase a D40.- It is twice (yes twice) as sensitive to light than the D80 or the D40x since it defaults to ISO 200. For a beginner, this simply means better pictures.- It's flash sync speed is 1/500 (better than the D80 & D40x which run at 1/250, very important)- It's colors are vivid and bright & the lens is outstanding (go into the custom menu and set to color mode III, saturation +, the results are excellent).- Battery life is better than a D80 (I can shoot over 1,000 shots on one charge with the D40!)I'm not going to repeat all the things about weight, lack of megapixels (who cares, 6 is plenty?), lack of compatible lenses (trust me, you will end up buying a nice 18-200mm VR lens lens anyways, the cheap one's aren't good ie. Sigma, you get what you pay for).Bottom line is my D80 is collecting dust on a shelf in favor of the D40. Your only real buying decision is whether to splurge $1800 (no lens) for a D300.

This is not my first SLR; I started with a Minolta X370 in the 80's, then got a Minolta X700, then a Maxxum 7000. I still have all these film SLR's. My first digital camera was a Minolta Dimage Z1, a point-and-shoot that tried to look like an SLR. Then, Minolta got bought out and no longer makes cameras. So, I decided to step up to Nikon. Since I already had a lot of experience in cameras, I expected a lot, and this camera has surpassed all my expectations. I have not yet found anything I don't like about it, and that's unusual for a complainer like me. Sure, I could have bought a Sony and re-used my autofocus Maxxum lenses, but I liked the Nikon so much better than the Sony models I saw that I decided to start from scratch with a new brand. It's easy to operate as a beginner, but if you want to stretch your photographic wings someday, this camera will be ready. In fact, this is easier and faster to quickly take a shot than my Dimage Z1, which is supposed to be a point-and-shoot. I looked carefully at the D40X, but did not feel that it was worth $200 extra just to pick up a few megapixels of resolution. This D40 package is a screaming bargain. When you pick up the camera, you can feel how solid it is; that's the feel of quality. Even on their cheapest SLR.

Having had some time to play with it, it seems appropriate to provide a general review.  More detailed reviews are readily available on the web; both Ken Rockwell and DPreview give well-balanced reviews.In sum, the D40 is a terrific camera for general everyday photography.  The D40 is probably not for you if you're looking to shoot more specialty shots, like sports or astronomy, due to contraints on the exposure time (max of 30s without accessories; see comments) and the comparatively slow 2.5fps speed.  (The D200 shoots at 5fps, by comparison.)  That said, I have taken some fairly decent shots with the kit lens in martial arts classes.As noted in some other reviews, Nikon removed the mechanical AF servo in the D40 body.  This means that older lenses generally won't autofocus.  Those (like me) who are new to the world of Nikon won't really notice; the only lens I've particularly wanted to get for it that won't auto-focus is the Nikon standard 50mm f/1.8.  For those who have older lenses, the D50 is probably a better bet, though the internals are a generation older.My experience with the D40 has been extremely positive.  The kit lens isn't professional, but it is fairly sharp, without overmuch distortion.  It allows some fairly tight closeups.  Shots are vibrant.I generally don't use the camera out of the P (programmed auto) or M (manual) modes, but others may find the presets for action, portrait, and others to be more useful.The controls are generally intuitive, though it might be nice to have more shortcuts to frequently-modified settings.  (My function button is currently mapped to change the ISO.)The image processing technology in the camera is excellent, and certainly one reason to opt for the D40 over the D50 or D70.  As someone with a little experience in image processing, it's always nice to see enhancements on the algorithmic end of things, and Nikon's engineers seem to have done a pretty good job.  Images tend to be a little over-exposed, but the exposure values are easy to change.There are lots of images available online taken with the D40.  It's usually best to try before you buy, just to make sure--so pick up an SD card and test-drive the D40 in your local camera store before buying one.

It's exceptionally light and small for a DSLR.  You can set it to \"AUTO\" and, without learning a thing about photography, be taking great pictures.The single-screen readout of F-stop, shutter, aperture, ISO, and everything else is a handy way to get all the current settings at once.  On the flip side, the UI is sometimes inconsistent. For example, pushing the \"zoom\" button repeatedly zooms in on an image you've taken.  Pushing the \"flash\" button repeatedly does nothing - you have to push and hold the button, then turn the dial to change flash modes (for example to turn off the flash).  That is unless you're in one of the manual modes, in which case pushing the button causes the flash to pop up.  Hm.There two non-obvious shortcomings as compared to a point-and-shoot that you may want to consider.  First, most DSLRs (including this one) don't let you preview the shot on the LCD.  You have to compose the picture through the viewfinder, then view the results on the (large and bright) LCD after you've taken the picture.  Second, you have to manually put on & remove the lens cap.  A minor thing that can become quite a pain, especially since Nikon didn't invest the $0.50 to include a little retaining strap - you're always mistplacing the cover.On the whole, I'm delighted with this purchase after shooting with it for a few days.

I don't consider myself anything other than an enthusiastic amateur, but like the general quality of the photos I take with the camera.What works well:In its basic settings, the Nikon is simple to operate. Photos taken with its auto settings come out good, but not spectacular. I often found that shots taken of Orthodox churches in Russia, where there was a great deal of contrast between the building and the background sky needed a fair amount of touchup in Photoshop to make a suitable photograph. People pictures are generally good, and the D40 is small and light enough to take to family gatherings without lugging a huge weight around on my shoulder. The 18-55 lens is a nice one-lens solution for 90% of the photos I take.What doesn't work so well:I'm sure if I took hundreds of photos every week, I'd know the camera settings better than I do. Many of the creative controls that I'd like to use are far from intuitive on Nikon's busy body - lots of buttons, lots of menu choices, none of which are easy to remember or quick to find when the right shot comes into view. If Nikon was attempting to bridge the gap between advanced point and shoot and creative SLR photography, the bridge doesn't quite reach both shores, in my view.Build quality has also been a problem with my camera. About a week before my one year warranty ran out, my camera stopped taking pictures except under the brightest situations. The shutter simply would not fire, no matter whether I was using the built-in or an external SB600 flash, the 18-55 lens or a 55-200 lens. I sent the camera and lens to Nikon around Thanksgiving and tried to decipher the cryptic messages they left on their service center website. After three weeks, they sent back the camera without my lens. Messages sent to Nikon would take days for a response to return IF I got a reply at all. Today, my lens is still in their shop, waiting for parts six weeks after sending it to them. How Nikon can take six weeks to repair a lens is beyond my ability to understand. I had considered upgrading to the D80 before this lens issue occurred, an idea I've abandoned now.One other reviewer here commented on Nikon's aggressive pricing, and I agree, on the surface, they have a nice camera. But for the money, I wish I had abandoned my Nikon loyalty and bought a slightly more expensive and reliable Canon. I won't make this mistake again.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "I waited a year to write this review", "Author": "Ken Wargo \"The BakPaker\"", "ReviewID": "R228AX32L9Q5XI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Amazon.com in March of 2008 and wanted to really use this camera before writing my review.  Prior to purchasing a DSLR, I had used several 35mm SLR's including Yashica and several Minoltas.  My 'transition' to digital was forced when my Minolta X700 finally broke and I purchased an Olympus point-and-shoot.  Having been an (amateur) SLR user for so many years, I was never quite satisfied with a point-and-shoot when it came to capturing action shots of people and my kids.  [...]I shoot the D40 in Program Mode with the color and saturation set to max.  I usually shoot with the exposure compensation set at -0.7.  I programmed the Fn (function) button to allow me to change the White Balance quickly.  Like so many people, I did a lot of reading on Ken Rockwell's website ([...]I have found that I like shooting with the 18-55mm kit lens most of the time.  When using a flash, I actually prefer the SB-400 (I set the flash compensation to +0.3).  The SB-400 is great for fill flash (even the pop-up flash is good) and taking photos of people up close and it's light-weight.  The SB-400 does allow bounce flash, but the head will not rotate.  I use the SB600 flash if I'm using the LumiQuest Promax Bouncer or the Stofen Diffuser or just need more flash power.  The SB600 flash will bounce and rotate.  I usually set the SB600 flash compensation to 0.0.The 55-200mm VR lens has been great for all the baseball and basketball photos I've been making.  I usually shoot individual photos of my son's entire team and end up becoming the team photographer.  I've even become the \"official\" photographer at our church for various events.  Of course, I love photography so I don't mind.  I have never considered myself to be a great photographer; I just love photography and am always striving to be better.What the D40 has allowed me to do is be a better photographer.  I'm sure this is true of any DSLR, but for the value, the D40 has been great and I was able to add a lot of accessories.  The flash is excellent and produces very natural flesh tones of people from light to dark skin.  This is critical when shooting people.My recommendation is that you learn about the various settings and don't just shoot in Auto mode.  You need to understand White Balance and Exposure Compensation.  And practice, practice, practice (you can always delete the crummy shots!).  Deliberately change the White Balance and Exposure Compensations to see how it affects your photos.  I do this in different settings, just to see what happens.  I have found that I actually prefer to NOT use flash if I can get the proper White Balance and Lighting.  I take one shot with flash, then take another one with the flash off and setting the White Balance to a different setting.  You will find, that especially with shots indoors, the proper White Balance is better without a flash.  Take the time to understand composition and lighting.  Like any camera, the D40 is a tool that depends upon your individual creativity.I'm no expert.  I'm just a guy that has loved photography all his life.  Digital allowed me to be better since I can see the results instantly.  The D40 gives great color, is easy to use and works great with the Nikon flash system.You will have to purchase  AF-S lenses for auto-focus to work (the D40 does not have an interal focus motor.  The focus motor is in the lens, not the camera).  I have not found this to be an issue since I don't have any of the other lenses.  This shouldn't be an issue as you will probably have either the 55mm-200 VR zoom or, for more money, the 18-200mm VR.  I am considering the new Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras as a Prime lens.The proof with any camera is in the photo's you shoot and how you compose them.  People are usually amazed at the photos and say `they just love my camera'.  My secret is knowing my camera and composing the shot.  Don't get me wrong, I've taken my share of crummy shots, and I'm still learning about composition and lighting and still have a long way to go.The only thing I wish the D40 could do is remote control off-camera flash units since I now want to play around with off-camera flash.  I'll probably start with the Nikon SC 28 - Flash synchro cable - flash terminal - flash terminal as I don't want to purchase a Nikon SU-800 Speedlight Commander or a Nikon D90.....

I'm still using mine, as in the sub-$1000 category the specs and usability are still great. Resolution is high enough for pictures to be blown up to 8\"x 10\", the image quality is great (much better than any phone with twice the megapixels) and Nikon is still producing DX lenses to fit. And it still lets you shoot at twice the speed as any other sub $1000 DSLR when you're using flash.August 19, 2007:I bought this camera for my recent trip to Australia and toted it from the Sidney opera house to Uluru and Kata Tjuta to the Cairns tropics. It's such a small, light DSLR that I carried it everywhere, usually leaving my camera bag and accessories at the hotel and just taking the camera body, the 18-55 kit lens, a circular polarizing filter and a walking stick / monopod (Trekpod). Photo quality was uniformly exceptional and controls easy to use. I left the camera in continuous mode and when there was an action photo opportunity I held the shutter button down to get a half-dozen or so shots and then kept the best ones and deleted the rest.The camera battery never had to be changed, and only got out of the green zone once, although I took hundreds of shots a day and frequently reviewed my pictures; I just recharged the battery every night when I got back to the hotel. The charger is 120-240 volt compatible, so I only needed a $2 converter plug to use 240v Australian power sockets. I used a Kingston 8GB class 6 (fast) SDHC card which gave me a capacity of about 2300 large jpeg images and never ran out of room over the entire trip, although I backed the card up to my notebook every night for safety's sake.There's lots of great information on using the D40 (and why to buy one) at sites such as [...] and I highly recommend checking them out prior to making your purchase. The more you read about what the experts have to say, the more you'll want to get your own D40.

Resolution is not where you make a buying decison. This 6 gpixel camera will be almost an overkill for most people. If you never print larger than 8X10 and most people don't, then buy this one. However it can handle much larger prints as well, but most people use the images on webpages and alike. You can never see the max resolution on your computer display or a webpage.The lens that comes with it is just fine. This is where the decision should be based.

I absolutely adore it.This camera is like 200 bucks cheaper than it's younger cousin, the D40X.  What does the X stand for?  Ten, as in megapixels, as opposed to the six mp this model has.  People think the more megapixels the better- but unless you want to blow up your photos into posters, you don't need them.  There's no discernable difference between six and ten megapixels if you are enlarging a shot to 8x10.  In fact, I have my camera set to take pictures using only three megapixels- it keeps the file sizes smaller and I get all the resolution I need for making prints up to 5X7 (I rarely make prints that large- usually a make 4x6 unless it's particularly good.  If I wanted to shoot something to blow up I would increase the file size for that photo shoot.I looked at some other comparable cameras and thought they felt cheap in their build compared to the Nikon.  The nikon lenses are excellent, and you won't have to worry about the company going out of business- in this market, that can't be said for all companies.

I've owned 4 different non-SLR digital point-and-shoot digital cameras prior to the D40.  Over the past couple of years with my son attending birthday parties, \"graduating\" from preschool, and playing organized sports, I've faced the severe limitations of the regular non-SLR point-and-shoot format.  The picture quality in less-than-ideal conditions (indoors, far away, kids buzzing around, etc.) has been unacceptable to me.I was hesitant about getting a DSLR because seeing terms like \"18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G\" simply makes my eyes roll up in the back of my head.  What I love about the D40 is that if I choose not to educate myself about these things, I can still take decent pictures.  Just putting it on the \"auto\" mode and using it as a point-and-shoot camera has produced pictures of far superior quality that my non-SLR cameras.  I've now started to use some of the different modes on the dial, namely Sport and Portrait, to compose pictures I never would have dreamed of.

After trying my 55mm 1.4 all I can say is wow! I'm glad I didn't sell those lens on ebay! After messing around and using the camera in manual mode and judging the light for a few days, I was surprised how much more fun it is to use than just using the autofocus.

As such, I have so far relied on its automatic settings for most of my photos.The photo quality has impressed me quite a bit.  There is no comparison to my point-and-shoot digital camera.  The camera is also extremely simple to get started with, as the auto mode takes full control over all settings and produces good results.My complaint with the camera is the following: I prefer to manually select the autofocus zone the camera uses, because sometimes I'm not interested in focusing on the nearest subject (which is the default setting).  Fortunately, the camera has a setting making manual selection quite convenient.  However, whenever you switch the camera into a different pre-programmed mode (switching between auto and no-flash auto, for instance), the camera reverts to nearest-subject focusing.  This can be quite annoying.  The problem can almost be side-stepped by using the camera's manual \"P\" mode, but that mode does not allow auto ISO selection.  At times, then, I'd switch to a higher ISO for a darker subject but then forget to switch back for lighter subjects and thus get slightly noisier photos.  This is of course my fault and not the camera's, but for an introductory SLR user it would be nice to either make Auto ISO available in \"P\" or allow the auto modes to remember the user-selected focus mode.I should say that my complaint is fairly minor, and I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Overall, I really like everything else about the camera.  Pretty much everybody raves about this camera, so I won't say any more about it other than that I agree with what they have to say.One final comment --- I bought my camera from J&R; through amazon and their service was unbelievable.  I selected expedited shipping and ordered the camera at around 3am EDT (midnight PDT).  J&R; shipped it less than 4 hours later.UPDATE: It turns out that there is an awkward auto-ISO setting available in \"P\" mode.  In this mode you must select an ISO value but the camera can automatically increase it in case it has difficulty achieving correct exposure otherwise.  I have not experimented with this option much, but it seems much more awkward than just allowing the camera to select the ISO fully automatically.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera for the Dollar", "Author": "J.

I've had this camera and lens for two days, and I love it already.  It is my first DSLR, so I can't compare it to others.I got into photography eighteen years ago, with a Canon AE-1 Program, then bought a Nikon N6006 a couple years later.  I used that N6006 all over the place and for all kinds of stuff (nature, wildlife, travel, portraits, art and jewelry, a wedding, etc.), some for personal fun and some professionally.  It was great and I loved it.  I sold that camera a couple weeks ago, along with the lenses.Now, I have the Nikon D40.  Hallelujah, praise the lord, welcome to the new era in photography.

Now, I get to think about pictures, not equipment.  That's exciting, and a little frightening, too.  Great shooting, my friends!--------------------------Update: One week later:Ok, so I did decide to think about equipment for awhile.  As I said, you can use this camera in a number of fully automatic modes and get great results.  Nonetheless, this camera is a deep and powerful photography machine.  I spent the last week experimenting with the camera and reading a lot of literature, user group postings, etc. online.  As probably with all dSLR's, you can go deep into image processing parameters like white-balance, noise reduction, tone, brightness, and contrast curves.  I have taken the time to learn about these things (since I shot mostly B&W; film, before, I never thought about much of this.)  The white-balance control, alone, makes a huge difference in color quality (especially with indoor lighting).Also, unlike a digital point and shoot, the D40 can output RAW files (in the Nikon NEF format).  It's a bit of work to learn how to work with these files and get the right tools (Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom being excellent choices), but it can be worth it.  Using the RAW NEF files, you can get total, after the shot control over all the parameter curves I described above.  You can even adjust exposure (by up to 1~2 f-stops) after the fact!  Like I said, that's a bit more advanced of a topic, but know that you can do that, if you want to.Basiclly, if you're an old pro film shooter or if you're a digital point and shooter, this camera would be great.  You can start in fully automatic mode and have fun taking pictures.  Then, as you get the courage and desire, start learning about the different modes and features and gradually switching them from auto to manual.  The D40 gives you that choice on an individual basis with every feature, so you choose how much the camera is in control and how much you are in control.Pair this camera with a good image processing software package (I'm using IrfanView as my viewer and Adobe Photoshop Elements for processing, great software on a slim budget), and go as deep you want to go.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "An absolute winner", "Author": "Music maven", "ReviewID": "R3VN2IT2O99MZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I was considering a digital SLR I knew I wanted a Nikon, and I was shifting back and forth between saving up for a D80 or D200 and buying the D40. In the end, I decided that with the rate at which digital products improve, it would be foolish to spend money on a top-end product that would only be a top-end product for a few months. And the resale options would quickly disappear. Better, I thought, to go with the cheaper model and then replace it in a year or two if necessary. Now, having bought the D40 and used it for a few months, I'm very glad I made the choice I did. I can't say whether I would like the D80 better, but I can say that I find no shortcomings at all with the D40. The meter is terrific--having shot about 2,000 images, I can say I only came across one or two situations that fooled the meter, and I shoot a lot of challenging situations. The color is very good, too. The controls are all logical and well laid out, and the camera feels very natural in my very large hands. There are a few small things I might have done differently if I were designing it--mostly to do with the steps needed to get at some menu items--but they really are minor, and at this price, I certainly can't complain. The kit lens is a wonderful surprise, too--versatile and sharp beyond anything I expected at this price. I use a Canon Rebel XT at work (I'm a magazine editor), and the D40 is leagues beyond the Canon. The Canon's meter is inconsistent and easily baffled by even straightforward lighting situations, and the color is dull and flat next to the Nikon. And the Nikon is vastly more sophisticated in the degree of control it offers--allowing you to adjust the degree of a given white balance setting, for example. And the Canon has much higher noise even at relatively modest ISO settings, where the Nikon noise only gets in the way at 3,200, and even then it's tolerable.

I was a former SLR user in the film age but couldn't justify the crazy prices of DSLRs in the past. Now, I can't recommend this camera enough for anyone who is looking for better photos than a point and shoot can provide. As with any SLR, you will get more out of the camera if you learn the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. but unlike the more professional versions like the D300, this camera has modes like full-auto and scene (sports, portrait, landscape, etc..)  that help out the rookie.  In fact, I borrowed a D300 for a day and much prefer my D40.  The D40 is much easier to use and has some features (like showing overexposed highlights in the preview pane) that the D300 doesn't have.  The D40 is also much lighter and more compact than a D300 so I'm more likely to take it places.The sensor in the camera is wonderful, especially to someone used to point and shoot sensors.  All of your friends will be amazed at your pictures.That being said, I may soon graduate to a higher end version in the next year or two.  As soon as you want to move away from the kit lenses, you'll run into lens compatibility issues.  I'm about to purchase a 50 mm f1.4 AF and it won't auto-focus on a D40. Also, with 6 MP your ability to crop pictures is more limited. It's not critical but you'll eventually notice it as you advance.Fortunately, the resale value of D40s on Craigslist or other sites is high enough that you can sell it later on and trade up.  Thus, buy this kit and only switch when you feel like you've outgrown it.  A lot of people never will.One more regret is I should have looked more closely at the VR version of the 55-200 or the 18-200 VR lens.

To make it short, I narrowed it down to Nikon and Canon. On one hand, because my grandfather had a Canon SLR, and I have some really fond memories of that camera. On the other hand, I haven't had any experience with Nikon SLRs, but they still grabbed my attention.Finally, I decided to take my chances with the Nikon. Why?After visiting different stores and trying out the cameras, I thought Nikon had better ergonomics than Canon. Even though the camera itself (D40), and the Canon equivalent in terms of size (XTi) are pretty small cameras, I felt way more comfortable holding and shooting with the Nikon.Second, I thought the button control and menu control in the Nikon was far superior than Canon. For some reason, when shooting with the Nikon I could find every option I needed to setup the camera for shooting. It took me a little longer to figure it all out with the Canon. Plus, I still don't get it, but it seems that Canon moves their buttons around every time they release a new camera. I haven't seen this from Nikon.Third, I really like the color reproduction of Nikons in general.Fourth (just because I am really picky with certain things), I just feel that their entry-level equipment is overall better built and designed (and it looks somewhat more pleasing to the eye) than Canon entry-level equipment. The kit lens looks solid, and it is pretty sharp. Period.Fifth, shooting is a breeze. Photography is not only about the final picture. It is also about the pleasure of holding the camera, looking for the picture, and composing the scene (and shooting, of course). This tiny camera will do it all.Sixth, one important thing to bear in mind: i believe all Nikons have an AF assist bulb integrated to the body, hence, when using AF in low-light situations with the flash up, no flash will be used to measure exposure or focal length, therefore, people will most likely understand when the picture is actually taken. When using Canons, the camera emits a flash strobe to measure exposure and to autofocus, and after that strobe is emitted, the actual picture is taken, emitting a second flash strobe. When people see the first flash strobe, they think the picture was already taken, and they move away, capturing an awry picture. This occurred every time i tried to take a picture with the integrated flash up in low-light situations when using a Canon XTi. Never occurred with my D40.Drawbacks (minimum, but still there):1) No AF motor in the camera. What does this mean? You will be only able to autofocus with AF-S Nikkor lenses. AF lenses will still mount on your camera, but in order to focus, you must manual focus using the ring in the lens. Most primes do not have autofocus motors built into them in order to keep the size and costs low. So if you MUST autofocus, get AF-S lenses, or a camera with autofocus motor in the body (D80 up). Not a real problem for, let say, 90% of consumers, as they will likely purchase AF-S lenses anyway.2) Somewhat dissatisfied with Auto-WB when shooting indoors. Auto White Balance is not very accurate when shooting indoors, using incandescent or fluorescent lighting. Seldom pictures with wrong WB exposure using Auto-WB, but still got some. Make sure you always adjust WB when shooting under these conditions, and you will get excellent pictures. Then again, I believe this occurs with all cameras, despite the brand.3) Three Autofocus areas might be not enough under some shooting conditions. This can be resolved by using the AF/AE lock button in the camera... but it would be nice to have some more AF areas, such as the D50 had (5 areas).But then again, you should know what you are paying for.For the price, the feature set is SPECTACULAR. Obviously, don't expect to get a D80 paying this much. The camera is well-built, VERY solid, and takes MARVELOUS pictures. The lens selection is somewhat limited, but then again, you can always manually focus using AF lenses and using the MF guide the camera has built into.In addition, I had some doubts when I first bought this Nikon (due to my grandfather's Canon I really liked), but after my personal experience with both Canon and Nikon systems so far, this last one is a keeper.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Value around", "Author": "M.

However, I noticed that during the times when I just wanted to snap a quick picture, the D70 definitely wasn't the camera to do it with. While it's a phenomenal camera when it comes to really customizing your pictures, I don't know if I've ever had a really great picture come out while using it on \"auto\". Indoors with the flash on, my pictures were all washed out. With the flash off, everything had a red hue. I bought a little point-and-shoot, hoping to remedy the problem, but it wasn't much better!Of course, the first time I heard of the D40, it was in a Nikon commercial talking about giving them to a town... I visited the website and thought, \"ha, yeah right.\" A couple months passed, never really thought about it much.. Until the other day when I was in Best Buy and decided to browse the camera section. There was the D40, ready and waiting for me to get my hands on it. I took a few practice shots in the store and was amazed that the photos actually looked GOOD. No washed out look from the flash or red pictures like I would get from the D70 when it was on auto. I spent about 5 days arguing with myself over whether I should spend the $500+ on a camera I practically already had before I went out and bought it.The D40 is tiny compared to the size of my D70, and the weight difference is pretty incredible, too. While it's not a compact point-and-shoot, it's not nearly as hefty as most of the dSLR's out there. All of the practice shots I've taken around my house have looked fantastic, even the shot of the pudding Snack Pack on my desk ;) The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I was hoping the batteries and memory cards would be interchangeable between the 40 and the 70, but they're not. The batteries are different and the d40 takes an SD card while the 70 takes a compactflash card. Other than that, I'm MORE than pleased with the Nikon D40!

(And it's not bad at ISO 3200 either...)I had me a D70. Good camera, but I traded it in for the D40. Yes, Nikon's D70-D80-D90 series are all good cameras, there's no doubt about that. But for me I find them too big, heavy and boxy, with too many unneeded functions and way too many buttons and options... Don't get me wrong; the D40 is still a DSLR and as so still requires a bit of a learning curve, but IMO you'll get up and shooting with it a lot quicker than having to go thru the D90's several hundred-pages-long manual!The D40 (like the D3000) only auto focuses with lenses that have built-in AF motors, that's also true.

But, I'm still not sure if the upgrade is worth the cost (FOR ME).I love this camera and it's an incredible value.  For a non-pro enthusiast who understands their aperture, shutter speed and ISO, it's probably all you need.Do I wish it had more than 6 megapixels?  No, not really. Six is plenty, especially since I'm not one to bother with much cropping.  I'm not in any hurry to fill up my hard drive with huge file sizes.  And, realistically I'm not printing anything more than 8x11\" prints anyway.Do I wish the d40 had a built in lens motor?  I do, though most of the newer Nikon lenses (including the kit lens) have the motor built-in.  If you are new to the Nikon line, you probably won't have to worry about this.  If you have some old Nikon lenses, manual focusing isn't terribly difficult, and I do it all the time with my Nikon 50mm f/1.8D which doesn't have the focusing motor in it.  I've gotten fantastic shots in manual mode.  It's actually kinda fun to manually focus as it makes me think and compose my shots a little more.Do I wish the d40 had a dust removal system?  I do, but if you're careful there probably won't be a problem.  I switch between the kit lens, the 50mm, and the 55-200VR lens all the time and in two years haven't had any dust get on the sensor (knock on wood!)Do I wish it had the D90's HD video?  It'd be fun, I admit.  But, it's not a deal-maker/deal-breaker.  I bought the D40 to be a photographer, not a video maker.  Besides, I have my point-and-shoot for quick vids.In conclusion: If you are eager to dip your foot in the DSLR world, but don't want to break the bank, the D40 is a great choice.

Once you get used to all the features, indicators, etc, it's pretty easy to use. Overall the fit and feel is great, seems like a pretty durable piece of equipment.

Secondly, the camera consistently over exposes by 2/3 to 1 full stop. I later found that this is a well documented issue discussed in many online forums.

I purchased the D40 as a first DSLR, but not as a first SLR.  As a former film SLR shooter getting back into SLR photography after a long absence, I was convinced by the many very positive reviews of the D40 that it would provide an excellent entry point.  Ken Rockwell's rave reviews, in particular, had a strong influence on my decision, as did many of the favorable reviews posted here.In retrospect, for somebody in my position, I think that perhaps some of the D40's positives have been slightly overstated, and some of the negatives slightly understated.  I would suggest that any prospective purchasers who feel they might aspire to any level of seriousness in their photography should give careful consideration to whether the D40 will be truly satisfactory to them beyond the short term.  In my case I owned the D40 for about a month before deciding that the D90 would have been a better choice.  I made the swap and find myself much better off for it.Things to consider:- Every review points out that the D40 can only autofocus using Nikon's latest (and most expensive) AF-S lenses.  I optimistically underestimated the degree to which this would quickly become a handicap for me.  Yes, these are Nikon's best lenses, but the reality is that in practice you will be able to do much more, much sooner, at much lower expense, if you are willing and able to use older \"D\" and \"G\" type AF lenses along with one or two of the newer AF-S lenses.  As one example, perhaps the second or third lens most semi-serious shooters would want to buy for a DSLR is something along the lines of a 50mm f/1.8 prime.  Cheap and excellent, Nikon's 50/1.8 will immediately give you creative options that don't exist in any AF-S lens, at any price.  Other excellent lenses, like the 85mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8, 80-200mm f/2.8 zooms, 28-200mm \"G\" zoom, and various third-party and wide-angle options, either don't exist yet in AF-S form, or cost so much more to buy that a casual hobbyist like myself would have a very hard time justifying the expense.- High ISO (low light) performance.  One of the great advantages of digital over film is the improvement in light capture that has come along with it.  Low light, hand-held photography can be done now that was really completely impossible just a couple of decades ago.  The D40 did not really allow me to experience this benefit as fully as I'd expected.  I found an ISO setting of 800 on the D40 to be the maximum \"good quality\" setting, and noticeably less clean than the \"base\" ISO of 200.  My informal impression is that the D90 is between one and two stops better.  Combine that with the D90's ability to use faster lenses at lower cost than the D40, and the practical reality is that I can shoot equivalent quality photos in one-quarter to one-eighth the light with the D90 than with the D40.  That is a tremendous advantage and much more than I had anticipated prior to owning the two cameras.- Availability of D-Lighting on D90-and-up Nikons.  In my admittedly short experience D-Lighting is a feature of such tremendous value that by itself it might be enough to justify the extra expense of the D90.  D-Lighting is able to control the contrast between light and dark areas in a scene, which has always been one of the primary difficulties facing any photographer.  This feature might be of even more use to a less serious photographer than to a serious one since it will invisibly improve almost any casual picture made under sunlit conditions.  On the D90, under harsh sunlight, I set D-Lighting to \"Extra-High\" and get very useable photos that would be throw-aways with the D40.  In most other conditions I leave it turned on but set to \"Auto.\"- The lack of a second (front) control dial.  Another surprise for me.  One dial, as the D40 has, allows you to quickly set one parameter at a time, such as shutter speed or white balance.  Two dials allow you to set two separate, usually related, parameters at once.  I didn't realize how great an impact this would have on the camera's overall usability.  For example, in setting white balance the rear wheel chooses the white balance preset (auto, sunny, cloudy, etc) while the front trims it (tweaks the basic setting to slightly warmer or cooler, six steps each way).  Or, during image review the front wheel changes to the previous or next image, while the front wheel changes the display (one click to the right for an rgb-histogram, for example, then one click back to the left to return to the full-sized image).  In almost every setting, display and shooting mode the second wheel adds significant flexibility and speed to the camera's handling.- 6mp sensor.  It is true, without a doubt, that excellent photos of almost any kind can be made with a 6mp sensor.  I am happy with 6mp for 90% of my photograhy.  However, I still found the jump to 12mp beneficial.  One thing to keep in mind is that  the flaws inherent in every part of the image capture and reproduction process add to one another, each only subtly, but the additive effect of cumulative imperfections makes all the difference in the quality of the eventual reproduced image.  Although it's impossible to quantify, going from a 6mp to a 12mp sensor might be the equivalent of going from a good to an excellent lens, while at the same time raising the limits of what the excellent lens can produce.  It is also much cheaper than the difference in cost between, say, a full complement of good, \"consumer\" lenses and first-rate \"pro\" lenses.  The bottom line is that each step in the process is important and each step varies from perfection.  Doubling the actual resolution with which the image is captured is worthwhile, and worth paying for.By contrast there are a couple of features the D40 has that I miss on the D90.  The most important is the D40's fast 1/500 flash sync speed, which makes it possible to use fill flash with larger apertures under brighter conditions, and to extend maximum flash range under many conditions.  The D90 makes me choose between depth-of-field-isolation and fill flash when conditions are bright as I can't get both.  Less important but also helpful is the D40's ability to be set so that the rear screen automatically comes on between shots.  Simply tap the shutter (to wake the camera or cancel the review of the previous image, if active) and the display shows you all the camera's vital settings at the same time in one place, and lets you change most of them with just a couple more button-pushes.  It is very intuitive and quick to use, and I wish the D90 had it.In most regards I found the D40 to be a superb camera and every bit (more, really) as good as I had been led to expect.  It feels wonderful to use and it makes excellent photos, or at least is capable of it (the rest being up to the user.)  If it were not for the lack of a focus motor on the D40, I would still recommend it highly for even aspiring serious SLR users, as the other factors can all be worked around or are only of importance under certain conditions.  However, the reality for any photographer serious enough to eventually acquire a variety of lenses is that, by the time they buy their third or fourth lens for the D40 they will have spent as much or more on their equipment than they would have had they started one rung up with a D90.  Viewed from this perspective, the various functional advantages of the D90 come essentially without cost even though they do, at least for me, add significant value.For casual photographers who will be satisfied with one or two lenses, or for more serious photographers looking for a second, lighter camera for part-time use, the D40 represents an excellent value and would be in my view a five-star camera.  For people on a strict budget who are willing to wait patiently for the functionality that will come from additional lenses, the D40 could also be an excellent (and perhaps only) choice.  Only people looking at the D40 as an entry point to an eventual comprehensive collection of SLR gear need to consider whether the D40's disadvantages outweigh its lower cost.  These people might find themselves, as I did, better off paying more from the start for something along the lines of a D90 - or, alternatively, considering an older used D80/200, etc. as their entry point instead.

Don't be fooled by the more expensive D40X or D80 that have 3 FPS.  0.5 more FPS is hardly worth the extra $300, and please forget about the in camera editing add ons that you pay for. You can get Picasa for free online, which works great, or take the extra money and buy something like Photoshop.  Both the D40x and D80 have more auto focus points(5 for the D40x and 11 for the D80), but if you are buying a SLR, most SLR users  focus manually for more desired results.  Even if you do use the auto focus, three points of focus is more than enough for any user.  Remember that when you buy a D40x or D80 you pay for the extra features, size and mega pixels (MP).  Don't bother paying for something you wont really need or use.  The higher MP are only useful for large print (and I mean LARGE).  6.1 MP is more than enough for the average photographer.Note: Any lens that fit a film Nikon SLR is compatible with the Nikon DSLRs.  There is obviously no auto focus, but they all fit and work perfectly.In the end some people just want more bells and whistles on their cameras ,which they will pay for, but the D40 is perfect for anyone including professional photographer.  I know several that use the D40 as their camera of choice because it is a bit smaller and lighter.  If you want to make a jump from the lower level DSLR cameras then I suggest you make that jump to the Nikon D200 or D300, and skip on the D40x and D80.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "C. Quinn", "ReviewID": "R2MCCHHOK9TH4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D40 is a great lightweight digital SLR.  I previoiusly owned a D50, and the D40 is lighter and more compact.  I have only shot a few hundred pictures so far, but the image quality is excellent.  There are some reports that this camera tends to overexpose some high contrast shots.  I have noticed this but I DON'T consider it a problem.  The camera tends to expose for the darker parts of the image thus overexposing the lighter parts.  This is not an issue unless your subject is in the lighter part of the shot.  In most cases the subject in high contrast shots is in the shadows or is backlit so the subject actually ends up being well exposed.  This turns out to be a real plus for a majority of people because they don't consider the placement of their subject relative to available light.  It makes perfect sense that Nikon would have calibrated an amature DSLR meter this way.  I have owned a lot of cameras and none of them have exposed shots perfectly 100% of the time.  It is very easy to use exposure compensation on this camera to correct for any under or overexposure that you don't like.  It's a digital camera so take as many shots as you want and just delete those you don't like.The D40 is very well built and the ergonomics are great.  I can see all of the viewfinder with my glasses on (DSLRs require the user to look through the viewfinder versus the LCD screen to frame shots).  The LCD screen is larger and brighter than the one on the old D50.  The camera has enough features and flexibility for the beginner up to the professional photographer.  Set it on auto and almost all shots will turn out great, or you can fiddle with all sorts of settings to your heart's desire.  All of the negeatives or cons that I have seen for this camera in various reviews are related to things that few people will care anything about.  Do some research and see for yourself.  The most important thing to consider is image quality, and this camera does great in that area as do most digital SLRs. The D40's flash combined with Auto ISO is great.  All flash shots I have taken have turned out very well exposed.  I even took some flash shots of my house from across the street and they turned out perfectly exposed.  Auto ISO set the ISO to 1600 on these shots, but the image quality was just fine.  High ISO shots taken with DSLRs are almost as good as low ISO shots taken with point and shoot cameras.  You cannot use megapixels to compare image quality between point and shoot cameras and DSLRs.  My 6 megapixel D40 has far better image quality than my 7 megapixel Canon 850.  Color and saturation are similar (the things that make people say \"ooh, pretty picture\"), but there is no comparison when it comes to noise and resolution (things that most people don't really notice or care about when looking at your pictures).You are wondering why I purchased a 6 megapixel DSLR when there are several on the market with higher pixel counts.  There are three reasons:  1) price, 2) size and weight (very important if you carry the camera around all day or travel with it), and 3) the difference in image quality between 6 and 12 megapixels is miniscule and something that absolutely NO ONE would notice by looking at my pictures.  If you take two identical shots with a D40 and a higher megapixel DSLR and blew them up to 8x10 or even 11x14 the average person wouldn't notice a difference, and more importantly...they wouldn't care.  Color, saturation, and composition are much more important than small differences in resolution.  These things are determined by the subject and the photographer, not megapixels.  Some of my favorite digital pictures were taken with a 2 megapixel camera I owned several years ago.  Save your money on megapixels and use it to take your significant other out for a nice dinner.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best possible camera for the beginner photographer....", "Author": "Leonardo Munoz \"Leonardo Munoz\"", "ReviewID": "R2E1B6CKXXKBX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, i said it, this is the best camera for the beginner photographer.  Now who am i to be deciding which camera is best for someone who has taken sudden interest in the art of photography you ask?  I am a beginner photographer!  I don't know much about technicalities so i'am not going to go into to all of that info, if you really want to know about the specs in detail then there is a review written by sidarta tanu labeled \"unless you are a sports journalist i don't think you can go wrong with this camera,\" that will be able to answer most questions you may have in greater detail, what i'm offering is the unexperienced opinion of a novice, and if you are a novice as well and don't know what the difference between vr and regular is then this might be the review for you.Let's start off with picture quality.......Even as a novice photographer i have to say that the pictures i have been capable of taking with this camera took my breath away,  the first week of taking pictures i managed to get some beautiful shots at the beach during sun set and some beautiful shots of princeton in the fall,  of course one major rule of photography, in my opinion, is to always have your camera with you, timing is everything and you never know what photo worthy occurance is waiting just around the corner.  This camera does just what it's set out to do, it take high quality pictures, all you have to do is set the dial to auto and click away, ofcoure i'am not telling you to just keep it that way, this is only for those starting out, i'am personally doing all kinds of research to try and figure out how to use the camera at its full capacity.The PriceHigh quality digital slr at 492 dollars!  you can't beat it,  the camera body does everything its set out to do and does it great, however i have found some blur during action shots and supposedly the high quality d80 and d200 will be capable of reducing that problem because those cameras come with vr lens, meaning vibration reduction which allows for picture clarity even in high action shots, this however is not a big deal considering the fact that when you acquire some skill with your slr then you will probably want a better lens, when you purchase a new lens just look for the vr insignia next to the name and you should be all set!What you get in the box.........When you recieve your purchase the contents will be the d40 slr camera body, the 18-55mm af-s lens, the camera battery, instructions, battery charger,digital camera startup disc, usb cable, and a small camera strap.  You will not recieve a camera bag or a memory card, so you might want to purchase the nikon bag kit, which comes with a battery and the camera bag for almost the same price as a single battery, you will also want to purchase the memory card so you can start your picture taking experience right off the bat!One other thing that you should be aware off, the d40 autofocus function will only work with the newer lens labeled af-s, if your someone looking to use the older model lens then this may not be the camera for you.In conclusion this is probably one of the lightest digital slr's on the market and it contains most of the same amazing features as its more expensive bretheren the d80 and the d200, this camera will give the beginner enthuthiast all the confort and picture quality tha he could gain from any of the more expensive slrs.I truly hope this review was helpful and i also hope that you can find the camera that is right for you.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "D40 is a gem -- don't let the megapixels fool you!", "Author": "Peter Anthan", "ReviewID": "R2B055GJG3XPRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially going to buy a D40x, Rebel XTi, or D80 (10-mp cameras, all), but when I read about the myth of megapixels (check out [...]) I decided that the D40 was a real sleeper, a gem discounted about $200 at the time to the 10 mp cameras.  This terrific little camera is perfect for the amateur photographer who wants a high-quality, light weight, compact DSLR that simply produces stunning images.  I've had prints made up to 11x16 and they are just beautiful.  The depth of color, sharpness of the terrific kit lens (which is visibly better than Canon's kit lens), the ease of use of the D40 -- unless you're a pro subjecting your camera to heavy use, there's really no reason to buy a camera like the D200, etc.  (A friend of mine, a pro photographer, agreed when he saw that photos from my D40 and his from his D200 were literally indistinguishable on a recent photo-shooting trip.)I used the $200 I saved to buy the equally terrific Nikon 55-200mm VR zoom lens (I do a lot of sports photography of the kids).  That's a much better investment than needless megapixels, especially since it basically eliminates the need to crop photos (it's the 35mm equivalent of an 80-300 zoom).  Plus, the D40's flash sync speed is higher than the D40x which makes a real difference shooting indoor sports with flash.Whether you're just getting into digital photography or want to upgrade from a point-and-shoot, a beginner or been shooting for years, the D40 is a wonderful camera, hard to believe it's less than $500!  Nikon did a great, great job of delivering a camera that is long on high-quality optics, useful controls, and stunning images while sparing you the useless marketing gimmicks like umpteen focusing points or \"mine has more\" megapixels.

Two years ago I knew nothing about photography and needed something that would make getting bird pictures easy. A friend of mine recommended the Sony DSC-H1. It's an \"SLR like\" camera. After a while, I started seeing the limitations of that camera and wanted to upgrade. I have learned the basics of photography on that Sony and was ready for the change.My roommate ordered a Nikon D40 and the 55mm-200mmVR lens. The first thing that impressed me was it's performance in low light (remember I had only used a fixed lens camera). He showed me some shots he took with it and let me play a little with it. All I can say is that I fell in love with this camera! It's perfect if it's your first SLR but, that does not in any way mean that pros won't enjoy it. I know a few pros who have a D40 and they love it as much as their D3's or whatever.I finally ordered on with the kit lens and the same 55mm-200mmVR lens my roommate has. Doing mostly wildlife, I shoot telephoto 90% of the time so I rarely ever use the kit lens but, it's a gem of a lens as well. I have been able to capture some great shots and have really built a nice gallery.This camera is so easy to use it's insane! the menus are great and easy to understand. Only if you know absolutely nothing about photography will you ever need to use the owners manual, it's that good!pros:Small size and light weight make it a breeze to carry around. I was able to stick it on my carry on bag in a small camcorder bag on a plane.Battery life is great! Up to 1000 shots at times. I tend to constantly recompose and focus so this could be even longer with normal photographers.Good ISO performance for an entry level SLR. Better than the higher priced D60 as that model has more megapixels crammed into the same size area, making them smaller and thus less sensative to light. ISO 1600 is actually pretty good if you don't crop.Can't beat the price. All other SLR's in it's class, even those from Nikon are at least 150-200 dollars more.Cons:metering is defective. You have to set the exposure compensation to -3 or -7 to get a good exposure.Auto ISO does not turn off in full manual mode! This can screw up your exposures and pictures so be careful of this.Will only auto-focus with AF-S or AF-I lenses (the motor on these is in the lens). The D40 does not have an auto-focus mechanism in the camera. This will limit your choice of lenses. If like me, you need auto-focus because your vision isn't the best when looking through a view finder (my contact lenses tend to hate being restricted), this can be a handicap. I don't always trust my eyes to focus correctly.These days, I now shoot with the 70mm-300mmVR lens. I've learned to really drive the camera to get more out of it. I will be upgrading to a D300 within the next 6 months or so because of what I now do. However the D40 will always be a favorite of mine and will still be used, perhaps most of the time when I'm not doing bird photography. This camera actually teaches you how to use and SLR if you've never used one before. It's also a great teaching tool if you wish to show someone else. If you're thinking about an SLR as your first one, or if you want a second camera, I would recommend the D40 either way.

I had Canon D30 and got a 350D (Rebel XT) and found it to be a very compelling camera.  One of the reasons I bought it over the Nikon was for the extra mega-pixels and it got good reviews.  I still like it but it's no longer my first choice and I may soon sell it because subjectively the Nikon's better.  I got a great deal on a Sony a100 and it's a terrific camera.  I've got tele lenses and in poor light it stabilizes the picture well enough to allow the shutter to stay open as long as it needs to properly expose the shot and there's no blur because of the anti-shake.  So for long distance it's a great choice.  It's a great camera and I'm keeping it because of its amazing capabilities.  But this Nikon D40 hit a sweet spot for me.  If I'm going to grab a camera to take a great shot, I grab the D40.  Inside and out it takes quick, sure fire great shots.  Light with great LCD and the best menu system with help even.  It's quick and the pictures are smooth and just gorgeous.  I go ahead and ask it for \"vivid\" color so I don't have to post process much and usually set the exposure to under expose a hair.

I had a lot of previous experience with the XTi, and my boss shoots Canon, but I wanted to go a different route, and I thought the D40 was the way to go. It felt nicer in my hand than even the more expensive Canons, and I thought it just took nice pictures. I've had this for a month now, and after getting it set up the way I wanted I think it's just about perfect for how much I paid for it. The default color setting (IIIa) was just a bit too obnoxious to me, so I switched it to mode Ia which is what all the other Nikon SLRs are preset to, and it gives nice colors. White balance struggles a bit under fluorescent lights, but most cameras seem to suffer from the same problem. The first thing I noticed about this camera is how contrasty the pictures turn out, but I like them like that. I only ever use the center AF point so I'm not bothered by the lack of AF points. The kit lens wasn't bad, but I quickly moved up to a 50mm 1.8 and now I almost singularly use that lens, even though it is manual focus on this camera. (I shot parts of a wedding with it - manual focus is decently quick once you get used to it.) For those of you worried about the lack of compatibility with non AF-S lenses, a little light goes on in the viewfinder if you're in focus, so it really isn't as hard as you think.I still prefer this little camera over the nicer Canons in my boss's arsenal - if you're debating this over the Rebels, I'd say they're both good cameras, but try them both out before you decide.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best!", "Author": "Donald P.

That lens is wide enough to capture people in a room and brings in distance objects very nicely. The lens' VR (vibration reduction) feature is VERY nice too. I've hand-held long exposures and seen little blurring. The real purpose of VR is for those far away shots, but it's nice for slow sutter speeds too. The camera itself feels great in the hand and has a nice finger grip so the camera feels secure when walking around. The menus are pretty straight-forward and I enjoyed reading the manual and experimenting for an hour or so as soon as I unboxed it and charged the battery. You can get great pictures right from the start if you set it on auto, but this camera offers much more if you take the time to study the features. The battery lasts a long time (I think I took about 260 shots without recharging). I also bought the 1GB chip (why cut cheap corners?).To be a perfect camera, it would give me better control of WHERE to focus on automatic, be easier to frame one area and hold the focus and light metering while I move it (I can do this, but it's not intuitive enough for my little brain to remember after a week!), it would have more than 6MP so I could crop out small areas without losing detail.Great camera!

I even used this camera to photograph my brother's informal BBQ wedding, with wonderful results.  I've taken hundreds of photos with this camera, covering all types of photography (candids, portraits, nature etc), and the number that have turned out badly is incredibly small.  I have been so grateful to have it for family moments and trips (particularly my honeymoon).  For the price it has a pretty good shutter speed; rarely have I missed a photo because the camera was too slow.  It even does sports etc relatively well; my husband has used it at football games and I even used it to capture several good shots of someone doing backflips.It seems that most of the negative reviews are expecting way too much.  I don't think this was ever meant to be for professionals, and you honestly get what you pay for.  It was meant for people, like me, who wanted a better quality photo than a point-and-shoot and/or to start a hobby.  If you're looking for a truly professional camera, break out the checkbook and go for a better model.  If you want to take photos of your kids or your flower garden that look better than your friends $100 point and shoot, this will satisfy you.I do highly recommend a telephoto lens to go with it; the website we bought it from had a special promotion that included a telephoto and it has been WONDERFUL.  At zoos and on our honeymoon to the Carribean we have taken photos with the telephoto that look like they belong in a nature magazine.  I highly recommend that you consider investing in a telephoto lens as well as the camera if you are considering any traveling or if you like nature photos.  However, the lens that comes with it does an excellent job in and of itself if you cannot currently afford a second lens, it just won't allow you the distance that a telephoto will.I also recommend a good photo editing software; while the camera does an amazing job on its own, the edited portraits we have created with software go above and beyond.

The second real and demonstrable improvement over the Panasonic is when taking action shots. The Panasonic was a compact and had considerable shutter lag. By considerable I mean enough for the moment to have passed by the time you want to take a shot. This was made very clear while I was taking pictures of a backyard volleyball match or yesterday when I took pictures of the kids on one of those fairground rides that spins around very fast. Standing on the outside I was able to take pictures of the precise moment I wanted to capture. On the Panasonic this was impossible.Now the Panasonic was a great camera of its type. It had a great Leica lense that gave very sharp results in good lighting conditions. I use the Nikon with an 18-105 lens (see my seperate review on that) and the results are actually better. A lot has to do with me being forced to look through the viewfinder. I find that this actually makes me compose the image with more care. (This may be just me but maybe others feel the same way). The camera is also very versatile and allows me to adjust it every which way. The Panasonic was very limited in not having a bulb setting and in not allowing me to set the shutter speed much higher than around 1/4800th of a second.Anyway I truly love the Nikon. Whenever I pull it out it looks like a real camera and it gets wows from friends. That is something small and perhaps a bit silly but nevertheless I thought I'd mention it.The menu system is also very intuitive and easy to use. I keep the camera in a Lowepro bag and find the overall package easy enough to manage from a size and weight perspective. I believe that anything bigger though may start to become a bit tiresome. Maybe its sour grapes but is probably the reason I don't lust for a D90.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "switching from film slr to D40", "Author": "Peter Alfeld \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R2HMSA6GUH2LA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unlike most people who have reviewed the Nikon D40 here, I camefrom a film based SLR background, rather than a digital point andshoot background.  I still have, and treasure, some very nice andfully working gear built around the Olympus OM-4, which is a beautifulcamera indeed.  However, switching to the D40 is like moving from a bicycle to thespace shuttle.  The main advantage of a digital over a film based system is ofcourse that you can see the picture immediately, and use it to adjustyour parameters and actions. That's obvious, but if you are like me,and used to shooting film, you have to experience it to appreciate it.To me it was a tremendous eye-opener.  The LCD display on the Nikonclearly shows composition, colors, and brightness, and you canzoom in to judge the sharpness of the image.  Secondly, my two Nikon lenses almost always focus much bettermechanically than I could manually.  (On the other hand, if you dowant or need to focus manually then Nikon offers little help beyondthe picture in the viewfinder, whereas the Olympus has severaleffective focusing aids.)  Failure to get good focus was the mostfrequent obstacle on my Olympus (and on a film based camera you findout about bad focus only long after the party is over).  I used to shoot 35 mm slides because the usual commercialprocessing of paper prints produces average exposures.  It'svirtually impossible to get very dark or very light prints, unless youdo the processing yourself, or pay for expensive lab work.  With theD40 you can easily adjust the brightness of your pictures, as youtake them.  Another advantage of digital versus film is that you no longerneed to worry about the expense of taking many pictures.  You caneasily shoot hundreds of pictures a day, and later pick those youwant.  The 18-55 mm kit lens that comes with the D40 is very good, and thesystem is very powerful with just that one lens.  You may be happy fora long time with just the kit lens.  I thought I would be, too.However, I lasted only 3 days before I ordered theNikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens.That lens is a technological marvel. (It also costsmore, and weighs more, than the camera.) Its tremendous zoom rangemakes it more versatile than any other lens I've ever even heard of.With its vibration reduction system it is feasible in good light toobtain sharp hand held pictures at maximum focal length.  Of course youstill want a tripod if you aim for perfection, and you do need one for longexposures.  Both the kit lens and the 18-200mm super lens work very well as amacro lens, although I'm tantalized by reports that Nikon has somemagical macro lenses in their lineup...  The D40 has six mega pixels, (3008x2000) which is just fine for me.But if I was to start all over again I'd consider the D40x because ofits greater resolution.  On the other hand, the D40 does have theadvantage of a higher flash sync speed (1/500 sec) than the D40x(1/200 sec).  You can't use a wire release on the D40, but the inexpensive Nikoninfrared remote works even better.  I am very pleased with my Nikon system.  It has revitalized myinterest in photography and I look forward to exploring in greaterdepth its tremendous potential.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "The little DSLR that could...Incredible photos at an excellent price.

This is one great camera, especially for the price. For a little more than many mid to high-end point and shoots, this camera packs a lot of technology into it's small price tag. But for the beginning DSLR user, that technology works in the background so just set it to AUTO and fire away, and you've got the best pictures you have ever taken. You will wish you made the move from point and shoot to DSLR sooner! I did a lot of research before choosing the D40, and all the reviews seemed to point to this one as the best entry-level DSLR, and in the 7 months I have had this camera, I have not been disappointed. Thousands of pictures later, I echo many other positive reviews here - this is one of THE best electronics purchases I have ever made. So many people have asked about my camera after seeing my photos (quite a few have even asked if I am a professional photographer). Several have since bought their own D40s :)For me, one of the huge annoyances with a point and shoot is the time between shots - waiting and waiting for your camera to recharge the flash or write the data to the memory card. Not a problem with a DSLR. The D40 starts up quickly, is fast between shots, and allows you to take more photos without flash.In the beginning I used the \"scene modes\" and Auto, and Auto no Flash, but my interest in photography has grown since using this camera and I use the manal and semi-automatic modes now. This camera is great for BOTH casual and enthusiast users. Stick to AUTO and get great shots OR learn about photography techniques and delve into all of the camera's different settings for more difficult lighting situations, etc.Once you have your D40, if you find yourself getting interested in photography, you may want to collect some additional gear over time. Here is a list of some accesories I have acquired to use with my D40:LowePro Rezo 170 Camera Bag (Not ugly. Works great. Holds D40 plus camcorder or D40 plus flash, 2 lenses and room to spare.)Nikon SB-400 flash (Yes, you eventually want this. Small, lightweight, inexpensive. Saves your camera's battery power and recharges more quickly. Use it to bounce light off the ceiling for indoor photos. It looks so much better you will never use regular non-diffused front-on flash again. Get rechargeable AA batteries, I love the Sanyo Eneloops and I am slowly replacing all my AAA and AA batteries in the house with these).Nikkor 55-200mm VR zoom lens (Inexpensive, works great. Get the VR version, not non-VR version. Nikon sometimes does a $[...] [...] with this lens when you buy the camera and lens at the same time. That makes it super cheap).Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 lens (This is getting repetive, but this lens is cheap. Great value. Amazing low light, no flash pictures. I love natural light and this lens is my favorite for those situations where you don't have that much light available to you. One big drawback is that it is Manual focus on a D40, but over time you learn. Get the Nikon HR2 lens hood to go with it).Nikon ML-L3 wireless remote (Inexpensive, works well. Easy way to take family group shots for your Christmas cards).Sandisk Ultra II Sd Card (Have not had any problems with lost data. Transfer your images frequently to your computer and use your camera to reformat the card each time to minimize your chances of corrupt data or data errors).Sigma EX DG 52mm Multi-Coated UV Filter (No problems with this filter).One last thing, during my research I considered getting the Canon Rebel counterpart. To me the Nikon has several advantages - better menus (Canon's menu looks archaic and crude in comparison), better selection of affordable lenses, flash and other accesories, better ergonomics, better color rendition, auto ISO. Both camera companies are great and both cameras are capable of nice photos, but the D40 is much easier to use, and at the time I bought it, significantly cheaper I am completely happy I went with Nikon over Canon, and now that I have more experience in the DSLR world I look forward to upgrading to a bigger, more complex D300/700 eventually. But I know will still use my little D40 as well!One more last thing, if you are still unsure and want to know how to use this camera before buying, you can check the Nikon Digitutor online videos:[...]", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great entry level DSLR camera", "Author": "west coast chick", "ReviewID": "R3T1WL1S64TU7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS - I have bought a couple point-and-shoot cameras over the years (Canon Powershot and Olympus SP-510UZ ultra zoom) and the Nikon D40 is by far a superior quality product and a step above a fixed-lens camera.

I can shoot handheld with one hand only if needed because of the very good leverage provided by the grip.2. As a previous reviewer noted, 6.1 megapixels is plenty! I can shoot at ISO 1600 with the confidence that my camera will produce the best low-noise, high-ISO pictures. This is because the sensor is not crammed with megapixels.3. A fine kit lens. The 18-55mm AF-S ED-II has a small maximum aperture but still very sharp. It also focuses in a whisper. So quiet!4. Crystal clear LCD screen. Great for zooming-in when reviewing photos.5. Full auto or full manual control of  ISO, exposure and white-balance (WB) settings. For many new photo hobbyists auto everything is all you need. But I urge you to manually alter the WB setting especially indoors in artificial lighting to get the perfect ambience of the surroundings! Fine-tune your exposure to your heart's content!6.

I have had only film cameras until now, except for a cheap Fuji p/s digital.Not being familiar with digital cameras, for me it was kind of like trying to run the space shuttle. I, like some others here, looked at Ken Rockwell's pages for help and got some basic settings going that work all right.After getting familiar with it, I decided that the kit lens sucks for a lot of what I like to shoot, which requires a wider aperture than the kit lens has. F/4-5.6 doesn't cut it, i.e., impossible to separate the subject from background in a lot of situations, really difficult in low light without jacking up the iso. Not to mention that it sticks out of the camera quite a ways and I also like to be as invisible as possible. The honking big lenses just shout to everyone in sight that a photo is being taken (but I guess that doesn't bother all the shooters with the 18\" long super zoom lens always attached thwacking off bursts of 10 shots at a time). I am also not impressed with the autofocus, which sometimes won't lock on anything, dithering around back and forth until the subject isn't there any longer. And the camera won't fire if it isn't locked on something. So forget about photos of those fast flying birds.It's great for just about anything that isn't moving in decent light, so nice to have in the bag, since you can't buy the camera without it anyway.After looking at the prices of the faster single focal length dedicated digital lens prices (and after recovering from cardiac arrest) I went totally in the other direction and bought two Nikon Series E 35mm film camera lenses from the 1980s, a 28mm f/2.8 and a 50mm f/1.8 for basic lenses. These are roughly  40mm and 85mm on the D40. These lenses don't couple with any electronic components in the camera, and will only function in manual mode, happily neutering most of the camera's unneeded, sometimes silly, and sometimes difficult to use functions.The image quality is excellent overall, definitely better (and with a much different look) than the kit lens and these lenses cost me $30 each.There are many other lengths of Series E lenses available at reasonable prices so I'll probably add to the collection at some point.The lenses are really small and the camera is super easy to handle with them, just like an old 35mm.I always leave the viewing screen in histogram mode, set the shutter/aperture where I think it should be for the light available, fire a test shot and quickly check the histogram. Because the image shows immediately on the screen along with the histogram, I only have to move the camera an inch from my eye to see if the exposure was on. It's very easy to tell if the exposure is off, and equally easy to change the shutter speed if needed. It's as fast as adjusting manual film cameras I'm familiar with.The only downside to this so far is that they are a bit hard to focus as the viewfinder screen is not fresnel, but the 28 stopped down at all has huge DoF so it's mostly an issue for the 50 when shooting wide open. I'm willing to put up with it because this is a better set up for me, more like a mechanical film slr, but with a 4gb card it will shoot almost forever. I leave the 28 on it most of the time for street shooting and the 50 is a fantastic portrait lens.So, I give it a 3. It's easy to use and being digital it's easier to get the images in the computer than from film. The battery goes an incredible amount of time before needing a charge. Build quality seems adequate for people that aren't prone to dropping their cameras.Image-wise, I don't think it's as good as a 35mm film camera loaded with slide film, definitely not as good as professional print film in some high contrast conditions, not nearly as good as medium format film of any kind, given the ccd's tendency to blow out highlights any time there is the slightest bit of high contrast lighting. Underexposure is often necessary and then hopefully retrieve the low values in Photoshop.Still, it's a fun camera to use for snapshots and gives decent results, and didn't cost a fortune.

I am also very satisfied with the flash for my use, it takes EXCELLENT pictures in the dark my old Canon 3.2 megapixel would never be able to take clearly.USB transfer is fast using USB 2.0 (really necessary for larges images from this camera), and using an Ultra SanDisk card, does not appear to be any lag.Really everything I've done up to this point has been in Auto mode, and it's really amazing how well the auto-focus and the rest works. I really need to graduate to the advanced features quickly!Battery life: It seems to last forever, at least 200 shots. I haven't run one down yet (though I recharge often and purchased a spare battery -- a bit high at $45 or so).The camera's GUI seems easy to understand, and oh my, even lets me do simple image editing on the camera itself (cropping, balance, etc.). Don't know how easy it is to control, but a nice feature, nonetheless.LCD screen is HUGE, bright, and clear. Just be careful to keep it protected (that goes for the whole camera). Also surprising is that Nikon doesn't include any SD card, but not a big deal, since any included card would probably hold just a few pix at full resolution.Overall, I look forward to soon taking advantage of every feature this camera offers to improve image quality even more.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great first DSLR", "Author": "Matt Skuegler", "ReviewID": "R2N2Y0MG0SLHWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my D40 for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with it.

It allows me to easily carry it around wherever I go, along with a few compact lenses, always ready to capture the moment as it happens. That's a huge image quality advantage over an expensive camera and a bag-full of exotic lenses that you left at home because it was too heavy to drag around.Secondly, this camera has plenty of smart features which enable less fiddling around with the settings and allow me to focus on taking the picture. Some examples I like are:* Customizable ISO-Auto function allows me to set the maximum ISO and minimum shutter speed I want, thereby eliminating the need to manually adjust ISO for different lighting conditions.* After a picture is taken, it automatically gets displayed on the LCD for review, making adjustments, or deleting, without having to manually switch to playback mode.* A customizable Menu for easy, fast access to features I use often without digging thorough every available item. I can leave the critical adjustments like white balance and picture presets, while hiding those I use once and forget, like date/time, language, etc.* RGB histogram in playback mode lets me gauge if I need to adjust the color balance or if a certain color channel is clipping. Much more useful than a single-channel histogram.Some other notable advantages, compared to the competition:* The AF-assist lamp facilitates low light focusing. On cameras without the lamp, you'd have to use the annoying flash strobe.* 1/500s x-sync means I can use the flash with shutter speeds up to 1/500s, effective for freezing motion or using the flash to balance out the shadows in harsh sunlight. Other cameras in this class usually only go to 1/200s.The 6MP resolution is plenty for making great-looking 8x12 prints, and puts less space-clogging pixels on the memory card. Image quality is very good from ISO 200 - 1600, and I regularly use ISO 1600 in low light with great results. Included kit lens is sharp all around, and is perfectly adequate for making great-looking photos. Ergonomics of the camera are outstanding for its small size - it fits in my hand comfortably and doesn't make my fingers feel cramped.There are, however, some limitations about this camera which may or may not be a big deal, depending on how you use it, such as:* It lacks an autofocus motor in the camera body, meaning autofocus only works with AF-S lenses - those with an internal focus motor. Not necessarily a problem since all the newer Nikon lenses are AF-S, but Nikon also has a number of great, inexpensive, older AF lenses, and on the D40 these will be manual focus only.* The built in flash cannot be used as a master to control additional wireless flash units. You'd need to buy a wireless flash controller for that.* With only 3 AF points, you have to focus and recompose before taking the picture if your subject is outside these 3 points. Not a problem for me since I do this naturally, but something to keep in mind if you're used to a point-and-shoot camera.* There are no buttons for directly changing white balance, image size/quality and ISO. There is, however, a customizable Fn button which I assigned to adjust white balance, and with ISO-Auto activated, I rarely miss having these buttons.* 2.5 fps continuous shooting is too slow for getting multiple shots of fast-paced sports or other action. If you're not shooting those kind of scenes often, then it's not a problem.Overall, this is an easy to use, well-designed camera which offers superb image quality at a relatively low price, and with plenty of features that make it easier to get great shots, instead of getting in your way. Seasoned photographers who need the AF compatibility with older lenses or are shooting fast-paced action should consider the higher end camera models, but for a casual hobbyist or enthusiast, the Nikon D40 is as a highly recommended camera.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome starter camera", "Author": "K.

Most important the D40 can't focus early (Non-AF-S version) lenses. Also the D40 lacks of a top status window and dedicated buttons for ISO and White Balance found on the older D50. Obviously Nikon was trying to keep cost down and build a lighter and smaller camera. They have succeeded! The compromises are generally over come by the camera excellent image quality, robust (fast!) performance and ease of use. In all these regards it is a better camera then the older D50, which was a ground breaking entry level DSLR.What I like Best:1> Auto ISO works great (once you figure out how to turn it on in Program Mode) Picture at ISO 1600 are very usable.2> Nice LCD display. Big upgrade from my D50! Picture in review mode are very easy to see and edit. The LCD's integrate information display easily makes up for a lack of a top status window and with a push of a couple buttons you can quickly change most setting.3> Very powerful Internal Flash and excellent AF lamp. No red eye! Nikon's TTL metering with a flash is the best in the business and the D40 also sync up to 1/500 of a sec for excellent fill flash in bright condition.4> Highly customizable menu system and excellent in camera editing functions. The color balance filter with color histograms is an unbelievable feature to find on a entry level camera.5> Price vs. value, easily the best deal in a DSLR out their today.What I like least:1> As with the D50 the Matrix Meter on this generation of consumer Nikons tends to overexpose most of the time. This can be adjusted by turning exposure compensation to -0.7.2> My D50's Auto White Balance could never adjust to indoor incandescent lighting without a flash and the D40 still has this flaw. You can of course adjust it manually, but this is still a big problem for a camera intended for the point-n-shot crowd.3> The D40 is noticeably smaller and lighter than the D50 and in many ways this is a good thing, but I am still struggling to get use to the smaller grip of the D40.

As would be expected, freezing the action became increasingly difficult as the sun began to set. Then it occurred to me that the camera flash syncs at 1/500 of a second. I set ISO at 1600, set shutter priority to 1/500 and popped up the onboard flash.

Not happy with the shutter lag, and a want-to-be amateur photographer, we picked out the Nikon D40 Digital SLR.  The lens speed is fantastic and the colors come out gorgous. She has never gotten so many compliments on the clarity and color of her photos before.  The camera is light weight and comes with a heavy strap to carry. You also get a 18-55mm lens that zooms and distances the photos as you desire. It has an auto-focus option where all you have to do is press the button half way and it will focus the photo for you before you take it.  On Auto, the lens speed is fast as long as you have an object you are focusing on. The action option will truly only work well if you are focused on a fast moving object, otherwise the lens will stall and the photo comes out yellow and foggy. (But why would you be using action if there wasn't anything moving, anyway?) On Auto, it is difficult to take a picture of anything close (Say, within  8-6 inches of the lens if it is a larger object) since it will not focus it, but then you can switch it over to Manual if needed and take the photo that way.  The camera is attractive, the battery life is decent, the photos are spectacular. It uses a standard SD memory hard which was the same her old camera used.

The DSLR just has the image sensor, which records the light ways that enter through the lens. It's better to invest on lenses than the body. If you stay with Nikon, you will be using the same lenses as long as you use Nikon.That being said, this DSLR is perfect for a beginner. The physical dimensions are very small for a DSLR and it's very light! The grip is excellent. I have average/slightly large hands and I have no problem with the dimensions. The buttons and dials all make sense and I use them with ease. Some people complain about the lack of a dedicated WB, Quality, and ISO button but I really don't see the need for them. The customizable button at the side takes of White Balance, Quality tops out at 6 MP which is plenty for anyone (unless making very large prints), and the D40 has auto ISO, just like the rest of the Nikon DSLRs.The image quality is excellent. I have a 50 f/1.8 prime and I have taken some of my best pictures with them. Not as good as the more recent models (save the D3000, which packs in more megapixels but the high ISO performance is below that of the D40 see KenRockwell.com) Metering and the AF is dead-on accurate. No problems there.Display is also good. It's a pentamirror, which isn't as good as the pentaprisms, but most consumer/prosumer DSLR's have pentamirrors anyway so no complaints there. The LCD display is bright and large enough for me. I can even adjust it to appear if I press the shutter button halfway. If it had hinges, it would be perfect.The only things that I truly find lacking in the D40 is the lack of an autofocus motor. When I'm shooting landscapes or stationary objects, it's ok but when I know i'll be taking pictures of animals and people, I have to bring a lens with the internal motor. The 3 point AF is very basic and more would be better. However, because the D40 doesn't have internal autofocus, I find 3 point to be plenty. Besides, you can use the AF lock button if you focus in on an object and then move the camera.tl;dr Get this camera if you cannot afford D3100, D5100, D90, D7000, D7100, or T2i (IDK much about Canon cameras)", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overly Pleased!", "Author": "Full Vision Photography", "ReviewID": "R3KKTKVPHNTK10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the D40 as a replacement back up for my worn Nikon E5700.

Bezboruah", "ReviewID": "R3215TGLKM1WW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent DSLR camera for anyone with a limited budget.  If you are migrating from a point and shoot camera and intend to use this camera solely for family snapshots and vacations, then you will have absolutely no regrets with using this camera.  This camera takes beautiful pictures with the included kit lens that should satisfy any casual photo-taker.  Even for an enthusiast in photography who is migrating from an advanced point and shoot or a film SLR, there is no doubt that you would be able to produce wonderful pictures with the D40.Other than the pictures themselves, the Nikon D40 can be commended for some outstanding features:-Camera Interface: The menus on the D40 are straightforward and easy to understand.  Settings are not buried too deep in menus and there aren't too many buttons to press either.  One can easily change most settings such as aperture, shutter speed, exposure compensation, or ISO speed simply with the press of a few buttons and/or the twirl of the thumb wheel.-In-camera photo editing: I find the D40's in-camera editing tools to be very useful to tweaking pictures and making them look better.  In particular, the D-light feature really does work to highlight dark shadowy objects in pictures.  I also find the color balance feature quite handy in bringing out the color of significant objects in pictures.For a camera of this price, there are sacrifices made.  This camera is missing a lot of features found on more expensive DSLRs.  While not all features are necessary, there are some that I find notable:-3 point Autofocus system: The three autofocus points are all in a horizontal line in the middle of the viewfinder.  In many scenarios, this system will work fine.  But there are some cases in which I might try to focus on an object that I am not centering the picture on, which is when the camera fails to autofocus.-6 MP sensor:  If you're viewing small-size pictures or printing them 5x7 sized, then your pictures will turn out great no matter what.  But when you view the pictures on a larger-size basis, then you will notice the lack of detail and the \"fuzziness\" of the picture. Personally, I like to set desktop wallpapers based on my pictures; hence why I see this as a flaw.-No built-in focus motor: The D40 does work perfectly with any Nikon AF-S lens.  Older AF lenses will also fit, but they won't autofocus without a built-in motor.  I see this as a problem only because a D40 user cannot take advantage of older lenses that could be purchased cheaply from garage sales, ebay, etc.Overall, this camera is solid for a budget DSLR and makes a great first camera too!", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D40 is a great camera - check out my FLICKR page for samples", "Author": "William B.

For less than 500 you get terrific quality, a relatively light and simple to use camera that would give you much more satisfaction than other cameras.Among the many virtues of this camera I'd point out:- Excellent image quality: sharpness, depth of field, colors, etc.- Meaningful quality: The 6MP sensor produces just the right amount of detail without overburdenning the user with heavy image files, slow transfers, etc. Keeping the MP count low was a priority when I bought this camera and I'm happy to see that I was right.- Good controls. I'm certain that more advanced users would like more knobs and button customization, but for users who want to take pictures without much tweaking, the scene knob and the dial provide a great means of control for regular situations. More advanced tweaking requires the menu, but I find that a reasonable compromise to keep the camera simple. Compared to the other (non SLR) cameras I used (Canon, Olympus, Sony) this interface is the best.- It's light and compactWhat I would have preferred:- VR lens offered by default- ISO 100 (yet the minimum ISO=200 setting is way better than the ISO 64 setting in a prosumer canon!)- More battery life (but I'm using it with eye-fi, which likely drains power faster)Overall, the quality of this camera is great; it's fairly intuitive and easy to use, very responsive.

I don't even know where to begin.I got the D40, because I was really disappointed with digital point-and-shoot models. I mean, they take excellent day shots, but indoors and nighttime suffers. Also you can forget having a decent depth of field. So, enter the D40. It's great for so many reasons.First of all, for an SLR, it's really lightweight and compact. Compared to its big brothers like the D80, the size difference shows.It'll take you a bit of time to figure out the camera, but that's fine. This isn't film, after all, so experiment! The menus aren't tricky to navigate, and the buttons are all pretty well placed--you don't need your hands to travel all over the camera to do anything.If you're used to using another D-SLR, you might think the camera is a bit crippled. I mean, there is one dial that controls both aperture AND shutter speed (it's toggled by a button near the shutter), but I find it to be great. The dial controls a good amount of features, actually. You can use it to scroll through the pictures you've taken, you can use it to adjust the flash , etc. It's really just a great camera to mess around with and figure out.Battery life is excellent, and I lend that to the fact that the LCD screen is not the primary way to view and compose your shot. This is a standard camera first, a digital second. You look through the viewfinder like you would a normal camera, and compose the shot accordingly. The data is provided through the viewfinder.Yes, the camera is *only* 6 megapixels. But megapixel count isn't as important as sensor size...for instance, my Sony DSC-W80 takes lower quality pictures at 7.2 megapixels than this does at 6. The D40 just has a larger sensor.It's a great beginning camera, and I honestly think you can get some great shots out of it.

I've shot about 18,000 pictures with it since then.I quickly sold the 18-55 on eBay and bought an 18-200 VR Nikkor, which is just great. Long on the Z axis when I'm lugging it around, but terrific.I also got an SB-400 flash, which has been great. It could cycle faster, but then it'd be an SB-600.The out-of-camera color from this combination is just wonderful. (So much warmer than the two D70's I've shot, one of which I own.)The only things this camera doesn't do that I care about are:  - Focus AF (non-AF-S) lenses like the 85mm f/1.8 AF Nikkor (knew this when I bought the D40)  - Control an SB-600 flash remotely. (D70 and D200 and perhaps others will)  - Have a depth-of-field preview button (theoretically, I care)  - Have a front wheel so I can have dedicated wheels for shutter speed and aperture, not just one wheelAfter almost twenty thousand shots, the above are the only complaints I can think of.I'm totally okay with the resolution. After serious image comparisons, I usually (99.99% of the time) shoot BASIC, resulting in 1MB images.This camera, even with the 18-200 lens, fits in my canvas messenger bag and goes with me almost everywhere.Just today I picked up a D70 + 18-70mm lens via Craigslist to handle two of my gripes with the D40 -- the lack of internal AF motor and a depth-of-field-preview button. So I'll see if I really care about the DOF preview button now that I can test it.My first comment in comparing the D70 and the D40 is above but I'll state it again: The color out of camera on my D40 is much more satisfying to me than that of the D70. Far, far better.

P. Urban \"Engineer, Builder & Mechanic\"", "ReviewID": "R2L90CJ8B0QQ3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As of late 2007, this is the best value price point in DSLR cameras.  The kit lens rocks (Top rated by Consumer Reports and many others -- the Canon Rebel kit lens isn't so good) and the camera is very capable.  The 6 MP sensor is the same physical size as the D40x 10 MP sensor.  So, unless you plan on making 16 x 20 pictures, stick with the D40 for better low light performance (low noise due to better ISO capability of larger photosites) and spend the $100+ savings on a flash or extra lens.Only aspect of this camera I'm not thrilled about is the matrix metering.  I occasionally find the need compensate for matrix exposure to get the shot right, but that isn't a big deal.  Just shoot a test shot, check the histogram (color balance histogram is best) and make an adjustment.  It is still better than most, if not all, point and shoot cameras in this respect though.  If I wanted better, I could spent 3x more to get the D200.I highly recommend the 55-200mm VR lens and the SB-600 flash as add-ons.  The kit lens coupled with the 55-200mm lens will give you ~11x zoom capability at an incredible price.  Nikon just announced a new 18-55mm lens that will have VR.  So, you might want to wait for that lens to be in the kit - The VR isn't as critical for short focal lengths, but it will help with indoor shooting.  The SB-600 is a great bounce flash and really helps with red-eye reduction/room lighting.

I not sure how well all the presets work because I usually shoot in \"M\" (full manual mode) but on occasion in \"P\" (programed automatic).

Before I got it I'd never had anything but point and shoots. So this was a big step up, and I was a bit worried there would be some huge learning curve, but I was wrong. If you want, you can just leave the camera on auto and it will do everything for you, just like your point and shoot, but the pictures will come out a LOT better.But this camera gives you plenty of room to grow, I've had mine for nearly a year now and I'm still learning things about it. The lens it comes with is also pretty awesome. It isn't a telephoto, so don't expect it to be, but it's a good all around lens.Now for the downside, and it really isn't much of one. Most SLR's have the autofocus motor built into the body, the D40 doesn't however. What this means for you, is that most older lenses won't autofocus. So you ARE limited somewhat in terms of lenses. But new ones are coming out pretty quickly at this point, so it shouldn't bother you too much.Now, for the stuff you're going to want to get along with the camera. You'll want to have some kind of bag, I personally prefer a backpack made for cameras, it gives me space for my camera body, my three lenses, my laptop, and then some. You'll also want a lens pen. You basically use it to clean your lens, it's cheap, just do a search for it and you'll find it. Of course as you use your camera more and more you'll want new lenses. I highly recommend the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, it doesn't autofocus, but it's a great portrait lens.So overall, great camera, and I know you'll love it too!(Update 5/27/2009)So I've had the camera for a while now and would like to throw in a cautionary note. I still love the pictures this camera produces, but I've had two separate issues with the flash. First time the camera was sent in under warranty and repaired.

When I bought it there were newer models available with larger screens and higher megapixels, and I've worked with a number of these since, but I still love my D40.  Here's a few reasons why:1. It's lightweight.  I can hold it one hand and take a self-portrait without feeling like I'll drop it.  This means I can carry this camera all day long.  That makes photography fun.2. It's small.  I use the awesome ThinkTank SpeedDemon V2.0 camera case and thanks to the D40's small size I can fit in the pack everything I need for an entire day's shoot.  My pack contains my D40; the SB-400 speedlight; 3 Nikon lenses: 35mm f/1.4, 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6, 55-200mm f/4-4.5; pocket-sized WhiBal white balance card; and misc accessories such as spare batteries, SD cards, filters, Nikon remote, etc.  A bigger camera body would require either a bigger pack or one less lens.  I previously owned a (small!) backpack-style pack, but after missing an incredible shot of a bear cub due to the time it took to swing the pack around in order to get to the lens I needed, I made the switch to the smaller/faster SpeedDemon pack.3. It's got enough megapixels for almost every enlargement an amateur photographer would ever need.  Yes, it's a 6.1 MP camera.  Yes, there are point-and-shoot cameras with 20 megapixels that cost less than $150.  Megapixels are important, but they're *NOT* the most important consideration.  Things like lens sharpness and speed (both aperture and shutter) have a lot more to do with a quality shot.  With a crystal-clear lens like the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX, I get beautiful shots with my D40 that I confidently crop AND then print 8x10s or 11x14s. Now, I'm not shooting magazine covers...but then you probably aren't either.  :)4.  It's got two crazy pro features that are worth using.  First, the D40 supports flash sync up to 1/500th of a second. This means you can use the flash in shots that require a shutter speed of up to 1/500th, such as broad daylight.  Who cares?  You do when your subject's back is to the sun and you need some fill flash to prevent their faces from being dark.  Second, the D40 has an easily accessible RGB histogram: When viewing a picture simply press the OK button 3 times and you're looking at separate histograms for the Red, Green, and Blue channels.  Admittedly this is a feature only more serious photographers know how to use, but if you want to ensure you're not overexposing the reds in a beautiful sunset scene, this feature is really handy.Any cons?  Yes, even though the 6.1 MP is enough for most of my shots, this is the one thing I could use more of for low-light shots.  I find myself shooting low-light shots where the D40 at ISO 1600 (it's highest, non-overdriven ISO) can only give me a shutter speed of 1/30 with my aforementioned 35mm f/1.4 lens.  More megapixels and thus a more sensitive CCD sensor would give me more room to get these shots without blur.  Still, these shots are the exception for me and I'd much rather have a camera I can carry all day that does 95% of what I need.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect camera for travel photography", "Author": "Vinylspinner", "ReviewID": "R1ED30A0W0FQGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every now and then a major corporation churns out a product that is too good for the asking money.

I they created masterpiece.What is so good about this camera even now in 2012? After some 5 years of using it, I could say, lot of things that matter. It is sturdy yet lightweight, does not attract undue attraction, can shoot 700 or more shots on a single battery.  There are times when you are not able to carry additional lenses with you, or when time constraint simply forces you to shoot with one lens. 18/55 zoom lens ratio will get you covered in such situations. Once I shot over 1200 shots within 3 hours time window. I could not do it if I fiddled with extra lenses.Perfect camera for seasoned travel photographer, but It can be set to Program mode and used as point and shoot.As a bonus, it can be tweaked to produce pictures that resemble Kodachrome slides we all miss.The only downside is mediocre low light performance.This camera could be found used dirt cheap because many think it is outdated.

If you pay a lot of money for a camera and then worry putting a scratch on it, the camera is useless to you. It needs to become your partner wherever you go. You can't take pictures when the camera sits at home on a shelf. The D40 is rugged and it is ready to play.Some people get hung up about resolution, how many sensor pixels should your camera have? That is actually the wrong concern. The issue is do you need a CCD sensor or a CMOS sensor. The D40 uses a CCD sensor with an aspect ratio of 3:2 instead of 4:3. ISO is 200 to 1600, versus 200 to 3200. So the D40 is a little more noisy at the higher ISO settings but using a faster lens usually solves that problem. In this regard I would buy the D40 body and get a better lense like the Nikkor 16 - 70 mm.I would like to make one more point, many articles and reviews state that this is a great starter DSLR. Really? Not too long ago we used a square box for a camera and took pictures of the same quality as most expensive cameras. Does a good set of pot and pans produce great food, or does the cook create good food? This is the very same principal with cameras. Ultimately it is what you see and interpret that produces the picture and the D40 is ready to execute your vision.The reason why I give the D40 4 stars instead of 5 stars, the D90 is looking very impressive.

On that note, the camera is very easy to operate. If you are looking for one to just take out of the box and have at it, then you can easily do that. If you are looking for some more options and advanced features such as adjusting your own shutter or aperture, then you can do that as well. The camera has a comfortable grip with well placed buttons on the back so that you can basically operate the camera with one hand if necessary. The multiple flash modes are fantastic, especially the slow sync. If you are looking for a way to use your flash indoors and not have the picture look like it was taken with a flash, this mode makes the picture look a bazillion times better. The pictures come out very clear, clean, and sharp. I also have the 55-200 VR lens and from what I can tell compared to a few friends that have a Canon DSLR, they do not offer any lens that can keep zoomed in pictures as crisp as the Nikon VR series, especially if you have the skills of barely an amateur photographer, like myself.There are only 2 complaints I have. The first is that there is no live view on the camera. I didn't know that seeing your image on the screen before you took it was something that didn't come standard on DSLRs. I figured if a cheap point and shoot had it, so would a much more expensive camera. It's not the end of the world, but it is something the be aware of. Secondly, I guess to make the camera cheaper, they left the autofocus motor out of the camera. The only problem this causes is that if you have any older Nikon lenses that aren't the AF-S model (which include their own autofocus motors), then they will not be able to autofocus on this camera or the D60 for that matter.Overall: I would definately recommend it based on it's ease of use, extremely light weight, high quality of pictures, and awesome array of lens options (especially the VR series).", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "5 star camera for a 3 star price - Better than D40x or D60", "Author": "Adnan Shafi Rana \"RANAJEE\"", "ReviewID": "R3MPDY5P6YYUCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first Nikon camera after Canon and I love it.

The camera is so easy to operate and the pictures are way better than the pictures from my point and shoot camera. I first used the auto mode to start and easily made a lot of great pictures. Now after reading some books I started to use some other modes to take picture of landscape and portraits. I am absolutely happy with the camera. It makes me want to know more about photography. I know there are cameras that are 10 times more expensive than D40 but do they produce picture 10 time better than D40... Well at least for a beginner it is more than good enough.

I didn't want the traditional point-and-shoot with fair to poor image quality, yet I also did not want to spend an obscene amount of money on a top of the line model with features that I will probably never use.After narrowing the choices down, I felt that the Nikon D40 was perfect for my needs. So I bought it. For the value and price range, this DSLR is unbeatable. It has a quick and simple set up. I've taken about 50 pictures already and each come out more spectacular than the next. The difference between point-and-shoot and DSLR is quite evident. The color, the pixels, and the sharpness of the images. It is so much better and looks more professional. This camera will be put to good use. I'm already contemplating on upgrading to a bigger lense, preferably a 18-200mm. The lense which comes in the box with this camera is 18-55mm. But for amateurs, 18-55mm is sufficient for most. I will never buy or use digital point-and-shoot cameras again. Spending more money is well worth the quality of what you get in DSLR's.Take note though. There is no memory card included. So spending at least an extra $20 for a 4GB card is required. 2GB is optional. Overall, I am quite pleased.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D40", "Author": "R.

Because of that, I'll start with the negatives.Negatives:1.  Poor high ISO capability2.  Only 3 Focus points - makes photo composition a lot harder than it needs to be3.  Inability to wirelessly trigger speedlights4.  Small size and lack of buttons makes changing settings difficult in full manual5.  No autofocus motor in the body (but I think this may be more of a positive than a negative)Positives:1.  Excellent IQ2.  Very lightweight and small3.  Excellent price point4.  Compatible with numerous Nikon accessories and third party accessories5.  Easy to navigate menus6.  Building on Negative number 5 - I think that the lack of internal autofocus motor is actually a positive thing because it makes the camera lighter.  The \"limitations\" on lenses is really not that big of a deal because most of Nikons newer lenses are AF-S or AF-I anyways.  This really only comes in to play when buying third party glass.  As for Sigma, the HSM lenses are compatible.  All of Nikon's nicest lenses are AF-S or AF-I so that would not be a problem, although I don't really see the standard D40 user putting a $4000 lens on the camera.It truly is a great camera, don't feel like you have inferior equipment with this camera and don't feel like you need to spend a lot of money on a body for your first camera.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Delightful  D40", "Author": "Rita Tisinger \"RioRita\"", "ReviewID": "R3JUOF5BYELADF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter to use in her photography class.

Its very compact (the smallest DSLR, i guess), but Nikon did not compromise on the build quality. Its very sturdy and has a nice comfortable grip. The buttons are all in the exact positions where you would expect. Its also very inexpensive. So if you are planning to take a dip into the world of SLRs, then you'd be happy with its pricing. This would give your budget enough room to invest in lenses!!!Now for the features... The reason why i call it the perfect DSLR is that, when one upgrades from a point and shoot to a DSLR, then the options and features offered may be overwhelming to the point of getting confused on what to do.. Now here is where the 'Help' menu comes handy. With the click of one button the camera would tell you what the selected mode does and also makes recommendations like \"Low lighting, Flash recommended.\" This is a blessing to a total beginner. The option of Auto and Program-Auto along with a wide variety of scene modes makes the transition from a Point and Shoot a pleasure. The graphical view of the LCD screen shows the representation of a lens aperture and becomes very useful for a beginner to understand the concept of Aperture and Shutter. There are a lot of dedicated buttons (not as many as you would find in a Full frame, but good enough for the first timer) to adjust the most common settings like, exposure compensation, ISO, flash, Self timer. There is also a Function key which the user can customize to do a specific function.Now although this is a perfect beginner camera, it can be used by amateur or advanced level users as this can handle really well almost any kind of situation. Due to its compact size its great for traveling which even advanced photographers would appreciate.. It has a hot shoe to connect any external flash, you can add accessories like filters, wireless remote controllers, and also pick from an enormous selection of Nikon lenses as it works with any Nikon lens. One thing to note is that the Auto-focus motor is not in the camera body so you need an AF-S lens if you want automatic focusing.But as we all know nothing is 100% perfect, the D40 also has some minor negetives.. First, the 6 megapixel resoluion might be less for an advanced level photographer, who would like to make Very large prints.. But for most amateur users this is more that enough. My second concern is with the kit lens that comes with the bundle. When you set it to auto focus and push the shutter release half way down to automatically focus, the outer ring of the lens rotates to focus, this becomes a problem when using a filter.. But more advanced lenses of nikon do not have this issue. Another note. If you have large hands and fingers i would recommend you to go to a store and check out the camera for yourself to see how comfortable it feels. I have small hands and it fits better than my biking gloves!!!So if you are in the market for a compact Digital SLR and can get over the \"6 megapixel\" thing, then the Nikon D40 should be the ideal camera for you.P.S.

This camera is worth way more than I paid. (I would have been willing to pay up to $800.00).

The quality of the pictures is very good to outstanding when compared to my two other cameras (a Canon SD850 and Contax T3, a phenomenal camera btw).  As many have noted, do not let the 6MP be a detractor to purchasing this camera.  The indoor low-light performance without flash is particularly good and really produces nice pictures that separate it from my Canon SD850 point and shoot.A few \"It'd be even better if...\" comments:  The kit lens could stand to be a little bit higher quality (I noticed some purple fringing in several of my outdoor shots), Nikon should offer at least one fast prime DX series lens that will autofocus with the D40, and greater customization ability for setting \"quick keys\" for changing white balance and ISO, etc. (the camera really only has one such \"quickie\" button).This camera has really gotten me back into photography again and my biggest wish would be for Nikon to make a high end camera like the D300 or D3 and somehow cram it into a D40-sized body.  Until that day comes (if ever), I'd highly recommend the D40 because of the simple reason that it lets beginner to advanced users alike take great quality photos with ease.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent D-SLR for Price!", "Author": "Joey Minter \"joedipp\"", "ReviewID": "R17AT9AJBMWOFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using this camera for about a month, I have already taken over 1000 pics.  The lerning curve on this camera is minimum in auto mode, while there is plenty of room to grow with the manual settings for the aperature, shutter, and etc.  The only drawback to this camera is that the only lenses which will support the autofocus function are the af/s and af/i lenses.  I really suggest getting the 55-200 mm lense along with the 18-55 mm lense kit.  Unless you are going to be making prints larger than 11\"x17\", the 6.1 MP resolution is enough to keep from having to pay the extra money for the 10 MP D40x camera.  The flash on this camera is also very bright.  I have found that you can leave the flash open and covered with a piece of copy paper to help disperse the light of the flash if needed.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.  I have two memory cards(1GB, & 512 MB) that I used with my point and shoot camera, and the only time I need to change them out is if I leave for a couple of days without being able to transfer the photo's to my computer.  The 1GB memory card will hold about 280 pics in the large fine photo resolution, and about 160 pics with my 512 card.

The included lens will give you a good range for all your typical photography (family reunions, pictures around the house, etc). This camera is excellent for the person wanting to switch from a typical \"point and shoot\" to a more sophisticated camera. The auto modes give you the \"point and shoot\" ability in case you don't want to (or don't know how to) mess up with the semi-automatic or manual modes.The included battery has a battery life that is good enough for me, although I've used it mostly indoors and not in very cold weather which is known to affect battery performance. So if you're going to be shooting in very cold places you might want to get an extra battery (is always a good addition). If you want to shoot things that are not close to you (say a person/object over 10-15 meters away) you might want to consider buying a second lens, the Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens which is an excellent addition. Also if you're shooting a lot in poor light places (parties, anything indoor usually) you might want to consider an external flash unit (SB-400, SB-600 or SB-800).But the equipment included will satisfy most people. This camera is extremely more powerful than a point and shoot, and still as easy to use.And if you're worrying about the 6.1MPs not being enough, I will say that unless you're planning on shooting as a PRO and printing pictures larger than a 12x19\" you should be set with this I would say.-Omar", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon D40", "Author": "David W.

It fulfills Ken Rockwell's definition of a good camera, which is one that gives you the capability to get the shot you want when the shot should be taken without taking up precious time with a lot of fiddling beforehand.Auto mode works just fine most of the time.  Program mode covers most of the rest.  Low light shots do need some manual setting up.I am using the SB400 mini flash usually with the Sto-Fen diffuser for most of my flash shots and am impressed with the results.I got the small \"Ape Case\" bag for it and again am really pleased.  The D40 fits in like the case was custom made.  The yellow interior is a very good idea and the shoulder strap works better than any I've ever used before.

I took the camera back and exchanged it for the Canon Rebel XTi. I took 150 pictures, and to be honest i didn't see much difference in quality.In fact the flash is much better on the Nikon D40 than the Rebel XTi.Other than that i was still disappointed. I went back again and then made my final purchase. Recommended by my brother who owns the same camera and i have seen the quality of his pictures. I opted for the Nikon D80. It was night and day, between the D80 and the Canon XTi or D40. Yes i paid a few hundred more, but the quality in nearly every single shot was excellent. I am now well pleased. Hope this helps.

It has proven to be a decent DSLR overall, and terrific for the price. I do mostly casual portraits, outdoor/landscape and vacation shots. I've taken thousands of d40 shots and learned a lot. As of 2009, experienced shooters should view the d40 as a good backup camera, while beginners should really be considering the new d3000 instead.Where I'm coming from:I was shooting a 35mm Nikon N2020 from 1986 into the early 2000's (I'm too lazy for film anymore, but I still believe I was getting my best pictures with film).I then switched to digital point and shoot, but after a couple years I missed my old 35mm SLR -- the image quality and great colors that came from film and the feel of using a \"real\" camera. I finally sprung for the d40 based on low cost and good reviews. (If you've been to Ken Rockwell's site, you already know how much he likes his d40). After 2 years the d40 is still my trusty camera, and I've gotten *much* more than my money's worth (I paid $450 back in '07). But make no mistake, my best N2020 shots are better than my best d40 shots!Pros:(all well known)1. Practical. Reliable. Easy to operate.2. Small and Lightweight for a DSLR (ideal for long hikes, but still much bulkier than any point-and-shoot)3. Inexpensive.Cons:1. (Well known) The d40's automatic exposure often works poorly. You really need to learn to adjust exposure (by some trial and error), or you'll probably be disappointed with many of your pictures. From what I have read about the d3000 (e.g. Rockwell's site), it is much better at autoexposure and also features a special guide mode for the first-time DSLR owner. If this is as good as it looks, it means the d3000 has dethroned the d40 for beginning photographers.2. (Surprising) Small and Lightweight. Yes, I also listed this as a \"pro\", but honestly my hands are a little too big for the d40. The controls and buttons are close together, which many people love, but for me, the d40 (or other small Nikon DSLRS like the d40x / d60 / d3000) is just too compact! Also, while the near weightlessless is often a virtue, it's so light it tends to flop around as I carry it around on the strap.... Now I'm looking at stepping up to the d90 (or its successor). But I'm sure my d40 will stay around as that trusty backup for a long time.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great small carema", "Author": "S.

These all give very nice images (compared to what I had), especially the 60mm at close range. I'm already starting to salivate over better (and much more expensive) lenses. If I had it to do over, I might have bought the D40 body only with an 18-200 VR zoom - per reviews, it's slightly better optically and avoids having to open the camera body so often to change lenses (less dust concerns). I'll also soon be in the market for a 12-24mm wide angle.

The D40 fits the bill. I get the same image quality, and the ease of use is amazing. Even though the camera has over 300 combinations of settings, they are easy to understand.

The construction quality is first rate.  The menu is fairly intuitive and can be learned in a relatively short time.  I read several reviews before purchasing this camera and have to say that they were dead on.Great camera, great price for moving up from a piont and shooter.  The 6.1 megapixles is more than enough.  I can't tell the difference in image quality when compard to my son's D80.  I don't recommend the D40x because the extra megapixles won't be noticed unless you are printing very large prints.  The frame rate of 2.5 per second has been measured an closer to 2.8 per second. The D40x is rated at 3.0 frames per second.  Even if it's a bit faster,  the difference is minimal.  Also, from what I've read,  the D40x is noisier at higher ISOs.  I would put the $200.00+ savings into an additional lens.  I plan to buy the 55-20mm VR lens for a little over $230.00.

Evertsen", "ReviewID": "R3NIA2G09RY3CH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was my first venture into the DSLR world.  I had been shooting with my trusty Canon point and shoot for years and although I got great quality photos, I was often frustrated with the lag time of a point and shoot.I bought the Nikon D40 in February of 2008.  The price has not changed much since and for good reason. This camera is very inexpensive for what it offers, with pricing only slightly higher than some higher end point and shoots.Before I begin, You will notice in my reviews I do not go into the full specs of the camera.  I feel as a consumer if I want to read that, I can read it here on Amazon in the information or I can download the manual from the manufacturer.  So I do not include that.  In my reviews I include my personal observations only.The Good-~ Turn on time is nearly instant.  No more waiting for the camera to boot up and losing that precious shot~ Even in high quality mode there is nearly no lag between pushing the button and the shutter firing.  You get the shot you are going for every time.~ I always forget to shut it off, It powers down itself after a bit to save battery.~ Has all the capabilities of higher end cameras, yet an easy to use interface with an Auto mode.  A great camera for someone who is interested in photography or someone who just likes to put it on Auto and edit with Photoshop later.~ Action shots.  You can take rapid fire pictures with this camera that come out perfect.  I recently took photos through a chain link fence of my son's baseball game and got 8 shots from him leaving 3rd base to sliding into home plate that are priceless. TIP: Your speed relies on your memory card.  Use cards with \"ultra\" or \"premium\" speed ratings for maximum speed.  This is true whether you use a DSLR or a point and shoot from Walmart.~ Lenses.  There is a lens for every need.  Macro, Wide angle, Zoom to the moon.  If you want it Nikon has it and Nikkor lenses are top of the line.  At the end of the day a camera is only as good as it's lens and I really beleive Nikon lenses beat the competition hands down.~ Manual zoom/focus. I love this.  Most newer nikkor lenses have auto focus capabilities if the thought of focusing on your own is intimidating but I love having the ultimate control over my focus and I find that I'm faster at zooming and focusing than the auto feature on the camera is a lot of the time so I tend to just keep it on manual.  This camera does not have an automatic zoom and I assure you, you will not miss it.The Bad-~ Size.  It really is a pain to carry this thing around a fair or while chasing children around.  It's big, and that uber expensive lens juts out just asking to be knocked off a wall.  The neck strap is quit uncomfortable.  This has been my biggest pet peeve with this camera and the reason I recently purchased another point and shoot for every day and will leave my Nikon sitting at home except for photo shoots and high action activities.~ Framing.  You cannot frame your shot with the LCD screen with this camera.  Nikon finally added that feature on the D90. At first this made me crazy, what with having been a Canon point and shoot girl for years. And to be honest this is still slightly annoying. I have talked to other photographers who don't miss it but for me, when I'm shooting my kids' lives I'd like to be a part of it too, not with my face stuck in a viewfinder. I just feel detached when I have to look through a viewfinder.~ Video. Nikon dropped the ball on this one.  The Nikon D40 is capable of recording video but does not have audio capabilities.~ Flash- The flash on the D40 is very powerful allowing you to take great night shots.  It does tend to be a bit much in dim conditions and causes a bit of washout.  My biggest pet peeve with the flash is that it's so low profile I usually end up blocking it with my finger.  I shoot quickly, zooming/focusing and clicking and if I don't remember to take my hand off after I zoom/focus I'll block the flash.  It's annoying and I've lost some great shots that way.All in all if you want to move up to a DSLR go for the D40 in lieu of some of it's more pricey competitors.  It is versatile and high quality enough for the professional photographer, yet inexpensive and easy enough to use for those who just chase the kids around the playground.  Due to it's less than ideal portability this camera likely will not replace your trusty point and shoot, but it will be a great addition to your memory preserving arsenal.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far, not  too great.", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R1HJK66V7YOVEQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a couple of weeks now and am surprised I am not happier with it.

And the ability to switch out the lens gives me just enough creative control that I can really have fun while getting a great shot.  I can zoom and get a great close-up too which I never could with my powershot...  I have several friends who have the D80 and D90.  They struggle with the settings and often can't figure out why they can't get a good shot while I'm clicking away!  This is definitely a case of \"less is more\".  I love this camera and can't recommend it highly enough.UPDATE: It's so sad.  I was the biggest fan of this camera when I first got it.  I raved about how wonderful it was and my friends with the D80 and higher were amazed at the great pictures I was getting.  Many times I got the picture and they did not!  about 4 months into it the camera started to jam.  At first I was perplexed and went online and found others with the same problem.  Some said when the shutter button locks you can take the battery out and put it back in and it will work after that.  True but I miss the photo op doing this.  Eventually I shipped it in for a repair and paid for shipping and insurance as Nikon requests.  I received the camera back after several weeks only to find out \"they couldn't reproduce the problem.\" (????)  Since then, the problem only seems to have gotten worse.  I did more research and found out it most likely is a focus issue.  I would agree as I can usually take a long range pic but once I move the lens for a tighter shot the camera won't shoot.  My finger hurts trying to get it to shoot!  I've had friends and family all play with it to see if they can figure out the problem but they just shake their heads.  I'm so disappointed and frustrated with Nikon.  I thought I had found the dream camera.  Cannot recommend it though as I've gone from being the amateur photog at family events to being the one mumbling about missing another great shot.Update 3/23/10  I finally figured out the problem.  I found that if the camera locks up, I just need to jiggle the lens close to the body of the camera and it will correct itself.  It happens with both of my lens' so it must be a problem with the camera itself.

As a basic platform for any likely kind of consumer level photography it's among the best. It's quick to power up, the viewfinder is bright and informative, and the LCD is big and tack sharp. With its intuitive features and menus I'm as completely happy with it as I've been with the 25+ years I've had my Olympus OM series film cameras.Out of the box the 18-55mm lens is a match for point and shoot portraits, landscapes, outdoor candids and close range sports events. Quiet and quick to focus, light and compact, you won't miss the VR feature handy on longer lenses.Don't be put off by the \"low\" pixel count. Unless you are planning on large format prints, images taken at the normal setting are more than sharp enough for desktop images or print sizes to 8 x 10 and beyond.Reasonably priced and feature rich cameras like this are the \"gateway drug\" of the DSLR world, and as such are terrific values designed for ease of use. Once hooked on the D40 you'll find yourself shopping for those \"just right\" lenses or accessories - or even an upgrade - which is what Nikon had in mind anyway. Stands to reason they'd do their best work to make sure the hook is well set, and this slick little DSLR does just that. I might add that despite taking a couple hundred pics since getting the thing, I haven't yet had to recharge the battery.Two caveats - if you are used to composing in the LCD with your current point and shoot, keep in mind that this camera doesn't. Olympus' LiveView and similar implementations on higher-end Nikons and Canons will, if that's critical for you.

Accidentally punching the up or down arrows would bring an intermittent solarization of the picture or a density graph superimposed on the pictures; these are hard to get rid of unless one reads the entire manual.

However, I wanted to take perfect and professional type of pictures and for that reason, I wanted to have a nice little DSLR.I researched almost one month to select the best one in my budget. I checked out almost all the reviews here and there. Finally, I came up with this one, and trust me, this is really a jewel. I already took around 200 pictures, and all the pictures came out astonishing. I got a different kind of appreciation for those pictures from my friends.My suggestions to everybody, for P&S; camera, go with canon, and for DSLR, Nikon is a sure shot winner. I am not against Canon rebel series, or other DSLR brand like Pentax or Sony, or even the other upper level Nikon DSLRs. But, believe me, as a regular user, this camera is more than sufficient.

This camera is fantastic. The pictures come out looking flawless and the colors are so bright. This is actually my third dslr I've purchased in the last month and this one is definitely a keeper. The first two I bought were Canons'. The first one was the XS model. I really liked all the features it had but the pictures were just too grainy and blotchy under low light co0nditions so I returned it and bought the next one up, the XSI. I wasn't happy with it either as nearly every picture I took was not clear. The focusing was too soft. So I researched some more and was drawn to the Nikon D40 mainly because of all the positive reviews. Not only here on Amazon but on many other sites as well. The popularity of this jewel of a camera is very well established. It's even a lot less expensive than the Canon cameras I had. I've read a lot about people being not too happy about the availability of lenses for this camera but actually there are a lot of lenses for this camera and the prices are in the same range as Canon and other dslrs and slrs. It's true that there's a lot of lenses that don't auto focus but there's plenty that do. I plan on buying a few very high magnification lenses soon so having to manual focus won't be a problem for me since these lenses are very difficult to focus on a moving subject anyways. I'll be shooting a lot of nature pics like birds, insects, flowers and the like for the most so it'll all work out perfectly. To sum it up, I'm still in the learning process with this camera. All the adjustments and features will prove to be a very fun and creative experience for me. I very highly recommend this wonderful camera.

The three point AF system and 6.1 MP sensor weren't exactly industry leaders at the time it came out and today are paled by cameras such as the Rebel 1000D and the Nikon D3000. IQ and dynamic range is decent, but you'll see the differences between a 6.1 MP sensor and a 10. High ISO is VERY noisy, mostly owing to the outdated CCD sensor technology (vs newer CMOS sensors on all Nikons and Canons).The 18-55 ED II kit lens is the non-VR model, which is unfortunate since the VR is a big step up and has replaced it as a kit lens for the entry level Nikons at no extra cost.Lens mount-wise, this is an entry level Nikon mount WITHOUT the in-body AF drive so your lens choices are limited. This was a bad decision by Nikon, and they continue to do it to this day with the 3000/5000 series.  2.5 fps framerate is sluggish by today's standards, unless you're using the Canon Rebel series, limiting use to portraiture and landscape.In terms of logic and controls, those familiar with the D200/300 series of cameras will find the top LCD MIA, and a lot of dedicated buttons missing and have to chimp through the main LCD panel menus to get there. There's a reason higher end DSLRs have buttons everywhere and if you're used to changing settings on the fly with only the top LCD or viewfinder as your guide, get ready to navigate some menus and spend time staring at the screen, so I doubt anyone used to a prosumer rig using this as a second camera would actually throw a lens on it when used D80's are so readily available and cheap.I can't really recommend this camera since you can get a D3000 (a much newer and much better camera with the VR kit lens) for the same price or less.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "A complete novice", "Author": "Sabs", "ReviewID": "RIK4DWPXUYRA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lemme confess first that I am a complete novice in the line of SLR photography...but definitely wanted to cross the point and shoot.

I can find even the most innocuous flaw in a digital photo.  I currently own an HP 6MP digital camera which was sufficient for the task, but required significant lighting for a decent photo, even with blinds open.  While I didn't require anything higher, I wanted it.  I wanted to see what I was missing.  I am quite skilled at photo editing though.  If I'm given a photo that doesn't look that great, I can make it look better - bring out the \"pop\" as it were.  With that in mind, I went searching for a DSLR as I've seen numerous comments that any sort of professional-quality photos are not to be found anywhere else.  Budget was of course a consideration; so I locked in on two in particular: a Sony, and this one.NOTE: For quick and dirty bullets, skip to the end.First, this camera cannot operate without the included detachable lens.  This caught me off guard; From the pictures I'd seen, there should be at least an intermediate lens, but maybe that's just the angle of the images.  In either case I wasn't too pleased about it, but at least the detachable version was included.  My understanding is that these lenses are quite expensive - depending on how much zoom and options they contain.  Being on a budget like I am, I wasn't inclined to even spend this amount of money, but hey.I will admit that the number of options on this camera are staggering and quite intimidating.  The photo options are not included in the LCD menu like my digital camera; things such as portrait, landscape, timer, etc. are all in a turn dial control rather than simple LCD menu options (which of course would make them easy to navigate without having to resort to the instruction booklet).  Additionally, the flash control is, in my opinion, not well thought out.  There's a button on the front of the chassis that should be a switch to control the flash method, but it doesn't seem to do anything (another issue...more on that later).  Buyer beware, there are buttons all over this thing - a novice can easily be thrown.  If you're the kind of person who has too much pride to read the instruction manual (either because you don't feel like you should have to read it, or you just are stubborn), get ready for a shock.The capture button is press sensitive.  A halfway press does auto-focus; it seems to scan the capture area and attempt to pick up what you're trying to snap, and then focus to the optimal setting, then beep to let you know when it's ready for capture.  Pressing all the way down actually does the snap.  If the sensor detects a low light condition, it will pop up the flash module (part of the issue I mentioned above) in preparation to use it.  You can force it back down, but the camera will put it back up again.  In either case, the shutter speed is quite rapid - you can flash multiple shots in rapid succession, really capturing the essence of a moment quite well.The camera can save in different shades of JPG - quality levels which are controllable - or in the NEF RAW format, which can then be either opened with Nikon View software, or imported directly into Photoshop for more specific editing.  The RAW format is for the purist who wants greater control over the final output - if you were doing human or animal photography, or deeper macro photography, you'd want to use the RAW format and make the edits to that version before compiling into a final format.  Of course, if you're just a regular person who wants to take photos without thinking about it, JPG Normal should do you just fine.Keep in mind that this camera does not have its own memory.  That means you'll need to get an SD card in order to store and transfer photos.  I selected a 4GB SDHC (high capacity) card and it's suited me quite nicely.  By default, the camera saves photos at a 3008x2000 resolution - expect between 1-2MB per photo depending on quality (JPG) or 4-5MB per photo (NEF RAW), so you would be fine with a 2MB SD card if you're a casual user, but the 4GB SDHC is only $20, so I would recommend just picking that up instead.  Don't let them steer you to the high speed version; quite frankly, the SDHC is fast enough as long as you have a decent enough computer.  The camera supports USB, either as a mass storage device or as a camera, and if you're using Vista, it requires no drivers and will allow you to do picture import automatically.If you're a stickler for just plugging your devices in, you'll want to note that the camera does not come with an AC Adapter.  Instead, you get a battery charging dock, meaning you'll have to remove the battery whenever you want to charge it.  For most this isn't an issue, but it can definitely be a negative.  It also does not charge via USB, even though (rather insultingly) the camera will show you a battery indicator when it is connected.At this point you're probably on the edge of your seat wondering about the flash issue.  Well, it seems like the camera isn't quite intuitive about when it does and doesn't need the flash module.  On Auto mode, it should only show up when it absolutely needs it due to the lighting condition (unless I don't understand how cameras in general work).  On mine, it'll pop up at the most odd of times.  For example, I had to use it to take a picture of a windshield crack so I could get a quote.  It's a bright, sunny day here in San Diego.  From the outside of the car, it was fine, but when I did it from inside, the flash module popped up.  On a bright, sunny day?  I mean you can force it down and make it take the picture while it's down, but you have to hold it in place.  Additionally, the flash button doesn't seem to allow me to select an option to disable the flash completely at my whim - the only time I would take photos is when the light is sufficient that flash isn't needed anyway.  I tested that theory with my HD lamp and got results similar to an outside photo.  It just seems as though the flash wasn't well thought out at all.I don't think I need to describe picture quality.  A lot of customers have uploaded photos which quite frankly speak for themselves.  I will say though, as before, that with the inordinate number of various options on this camera, it might seem as though you'll never get to that quality.  I want to reassure you that you can.  Out of the box, the camera takes quite stellar photos in optimal (daylight) conditions.  Even indoors under certain \"daylight bulbs\", you can get some high quality photos.  Some have made mention to \"macro\" mode - or extremely close-up photography - and you can do this as well.  The one thing I can say to you is to not let the camera intimidate you.QUICK PROS:- Stellar image quality out of the box- Competitively priced compared to other cameras with the same quality- Textured, so it's not likely to slip out of your hand- Supports USB transfer of photos and/or SD direct- Works great even on the default \"Auto\" settings- Makes great use of existing surrounding light- Auto-focus is intuitiveQUICK CONS:- DSLRs in general, though quite great quality, are still expensive- Detachable lens is required in order to take photos even when zoom isn't required- So many options as to intimidate the novice user- photo capture options on turn dial rather than in menu with descriptions- Flash doesn't seem intuitive; activates in broad daylight sometimes- Compensation for motion doesn't seem to be very smart either- Would it REALLY have hurt Nikon to include a SDHC card?", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "6mp not great for cropping & enlarging", "Author": "Lizard \"lizard\"", "ReviewID": "R27VNGHE0A6Y3S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a mom of 2 little ones, I was tired of missing pictures due to shutter lag with point & shoots.

There are definitely a few things i like, and a few things i do not like about this camera. I will go over them briefly and discuss a few other things.Here are the Pros ( good things in simpler terms )* You get the versatility of changing lenses to get different effects. you can get telephoto lenses, super-fast lenses, super-wide angle lenses, and so forth. You do not get this maneuverability with a point and shoot camera. This camera being a Digital SLR is an advantage in and of itself.* The cameras delivers very good image quality, better than any point and shoot camera on the market. The images are very sharp, and all of the details are vividly shown, when compared to more expensive Digital SLR cameras, it's obviously not the best of the best, but it is good nonetheless.* The size of the camera is perfect for what it is. It fits nicely in your hand, and feels nice in it. The camera is made of plastic, and does feel a little cheap, but that is expected. People may argue that some of your fingers are left out in the grip, but that is not an issue to me.Here are the cons* With the Nikon D40/D40x/D60 cameras you can not Autofocus AF lenses. AF lenses need Motors built into the camera to Autofocus, and the D40/d40x, and the D60 do not have that motor. They do, however, autofocus AF-S lenses, which have a motor on their own. So, if you love autofocus, and have a few AF lenses, you may want to consider the D80 at least.* The camera only has six megapixels. This isn't a major disadvantage but you definitely notice it when you crop the images, so if you love macro photography, you may want to consider a higher-end camera. To the average day-to-day photographer, this won't be an issue, but for serious Photography, it is definitely a factor.* The performance at higher ISO's is horrible. At ISO 3,200, the images are practically unusable. You even see tremendous noise at ISO 800. If you are considering the D60, it is even worse. For low-light photography this is not a good camera.* No dust-reduction facilities. Yup, you are going to get dust in there eventually, and you are going to have to clean it manually with the D40, which can be dangerous if you are inexperienced, and you may have to pay to have it done, so this is definitely a con in my eyes.If you are looking for an entry-level Digital SLR camera i suggest that you spend a little more on the D60, you are going to get a few more features ( a VR lens, Dust Reduction, etc ) which are very useful. I would even suggest the D90 if you really want your money's worth. This is a good camera, but when compared to others it's not the ' best '.

I was very intimidated by this cameras price . With the lens i purchased i had over 1200 strapped around my neck, the few times i had it out i always felt like the strap was going to come undone and the camera was going to go crashing to the ground! this never happened but it was a fear i could not shake.2. I was very intimidated by this cameras complexity. I bought the idiots guide to SLR's and all of that and just never really figured it out, i guess i wasnt willing to put the time needed to \"master\" this camera into it.Since then I have only owned point and shoot, but with a trip to Egypt planned i decided to make the plunge and buy a \"high zoom\" Sony camera, i went with the HX1. it seems to be much less complicated, plus have many of the benifits of a SLR, we shall see once it arrives (I am stationed back over here again, this time Iraq)", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D40", "Author": "Somnath Basu", "ReviewID": "R2KXHARBKR54VI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera arrived a lot delayed.

I didn't rate it 3 stars because it's a poor performer.  I gave it a 3 because the hype made me expect it to be far better than higher end digicams.Didn't spend a dime on this camera - just cashed in some membership award points from AMEX.  These observations are as objective as I can make them.My frame of reference for comparisons is the Fuji 5100. Even though it's only 4 mp, the ability to use 10x zoom equiv to 300 mm without changing lenses and a nearly equivalent array of photo settings would have given me a serious case of buyer's remorse if I had actually paid for the D40.The number one shocker was that what I see through the view finder is not what I get.  I set the camera to continuous setting, jumped right into manual mode and started shooting away.  I shot over 200 photos of everything from hummingbirds, kids playing indoors and outdoors, and landscapes.  My mistake was in thinking that everything I shot would look exactly like the crisp imaging the viewfinder showed me.Wrong!At least 80% of the photos ended up in the recycle bin after loading them in my PC.  Almost all of them were too dark.Okay - my mistake.  I should have been checking the LCD immediately afterwards to make the necessary shuuter and aperture adjustments.  On to another batch of shots.  I set the camera to Large and Fine photos then headed to the local harbor with the 18-55 lens kit.This time I also brought along my Fuji 5100.  My goal was to set up the same shots as much as possible at both widest angles and max zoom.  Obviously, my Fuji would be able to zoom in much closer but I figured that with 50% more pixels, I could crop the D40 shots to give me approximate equivalents.The result is that in ideal lighting conditions, on as level a playing field as I could make it, there's virtually no difference in photo quality.  The thing that I really couldn't pass up is the constant reminder that if I had just enough space to take one camera on a trip, I'd take the Fuji S5100 every time.  It does everything the D40 can do and more without the need to pack along more lenses.The Fuji S5100, as well as many other higher end digcams, do something that I just can't do without.  They show me exactly what my photo will look like before I completey depress the shutter.  Pressing halfway, I immediately see what I will get whether I use the viewfinder or LCD.To be fair, so will the D40.  Except what you need to \"see\" is not the subject, but the viewfinder display line under the subject, in particular, the analog exposure bars which tell you if the output will be too bright or too dark.  In layman's terms, its a sliding scale with a \"0\" in the center and bars indicating \"+\" or \"-\".  The only thing the subject in view will tell you is whether it's in focus or not.So bottom line is this:  the D40 is a very, very good camera.  Shots are terrific if you plan on letting the camera do the thinking for you with AUTO mode or some of the other preset modes.  You can get used to reading the displays and become quite proficient at these.  But for nearly the same price, a very good digital camera with high built in zoom will give you photos just as good without the extra \"cha-ching\" you'll ended up spending on additional lenses.If I didn't have a good digicam already, I'd have probably given this a 4, maybe a 5.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Problem with the power switch", "Author": "Sachin", "ReviewID": "R1DL1K7OH7ZGS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this camera kit from Amazon after reading reviews from a whole bunch of places about this camera.

Worthless. It also highlights how Ken Rockwell should not be taken all that seriously.This camera is obviously old now, but I still use my D70 and D50 and shoot raw and the D60 collects dust. The D50 only takes 2 GB cards, has a slower buffer for raw, and is 2.5 fps over the 3fps D70 and CF cards, but it's better than the D40/60.

I have earned the right to say that after 35 years in photography starting with my education at the School of Visual Arts in NYC, etc. I have owned Leica, Minolta, Pentax and Nikon 35mm systems.This is a camera system for persons who wish to look like professionals by hanging a big fancy Nikon on their neck with the yellow NIKON logo blazing on the neck strap. This is an entry level *ego camera*.It is a great point-and-shoot camera in daylight for average people. That would be those who set to automatic and that is all they ever do.In automatic this will take great snapshots. But that is it. The 18-55mm lens is so cheap you can \"buy-it-now\" for $10 on eBay. It weighs about as much as a cardboard tube. Has a tiny set of optics the diameter of your finger in it. Real garbage.Want to do macro shots? Forget it! No macro mode as found on other systems. Buy a macro lens? The only AF-S compatible Nikon macro is $780. That nice 60mm macro for $360 is NOT compatible!You cannot use the LCD as the viewfinder. Nikon tech support told me this is only available on the $1700 model! That one feature, without going into a long explanation, is a deal breaker. One of the main advantages of a digital camera is to free yourself from the little viewfinder peep hole.Cheap lens, no macro mode, no LCD view, terrible instruction manual, only 6 mega pixel, no image stabilization...what is to like at all?I returned mine after suffering for 3-weeks and bought a 10MP camera with live view, macro mode, image stabilization, professional quality optics, along with an operating booklet that won't drive me mad.But, if you have to impress people with the iconic NIKON camera this is the cheapest way you can do it.
