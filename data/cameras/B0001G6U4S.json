For my step-dad, who has Parkinson's, the A75 has turned out to be PERFECT.The human engineering on small cameras is a feature people often overlook.  I own a large Sony digicam, but I can't handle any of their compacts or their V1 without having to concentrate on where my large-ish fingers are resting.  Another thing people sometimes fail to consider is how SECURE the camera is in your hands.  A child could grab the S410 from my hands, but no one on Earth could get the A75 loose.  My parents are in France with their cameras now and I'm sure that no jarring in a museum or crowded street will dislodge the A75 from my step-dad's weak hands.One reason for the nice grip is because that's where the four AA batteries go.  For some people (me included), this seemed like a weakness of the camera versus the custome Li-ion batteries of the competition.  However, once you spring about $25 for four 1850 mAH (or stonger) rechargable batteries, you will find yourself getting double or more the bttery life of a S410 (which with it's 850 mAH battery does surprisingly well).  The well-respected dpreview website has tested the A75's predecessor (the A70) in comparison with a slew of other small-format digicams and found it to have the best battery life by a wide margin.  WARNING:  the AAs that come with the camera only lasted one day of intermittent \"training\" use...so don't be disappointed.The A75 takes great pictures.  We set up a scene with lots of detail to compare all possible size and resolution settings (\"L\", \"M1\" which is 1600x1200, \"M2\" which is 1024x780, and \"S\" which is 640x480 (for e-mails)) and took a shot at each of those sizes with the three resolution settings (\"Superfine\", \"Fine\", and \"Normal\").  We printed them at 6\"x4\" at a local Kodak digital picture kiosk (recently deemed better and cheaper than Fuji's by a consumer group...Consumer Reports IIRC) and compared them with a magnifying glass.  There were no easily discernable differences in quality until we got to the M1/Normal setting.  Even then it was just a tiny difference in some detail in the pine needles of a distant tree.  In other words, if you're starved for storage card space, don't panic -- you should be able to get fantastic prints with this camera even with the lower settings.  (Another indication that there's rarely a reason to go beyong 3.2-4.0 megapixels in a pocket cam -- don't waste your money on ANY compact 5.0 cam, Canon or otherwise (ex. S500 -- forget it!).The A75 uses the ubiquitous Compact Flash Type I cards.  That's not as important as it used to be (all cards, SD included, are rapidly getting cheaper).  However, you can get these anywhere for cheap in a pinch, and Amazon has GREAT deals on CF cards.  I got each of my parents a SanDisk 512 card for ~80 each -- that was six weeks ago and they've dropped since.  My step-dad's A75 on max size/max-resolution (\"L\"/\"Superfine\") will take just over 300 pictures on that card!  (My mom's S410 will handle a bit less -- 280 IIRC).The picture quality on auto is great, the \"panorama\" feature is addicting as heck (I'm looking forward to their France panoramas -- a feature offered on the A75 and the S410).The included software is fine -- nothing special, but all you need, and it worked on my parent's old PIII running Microsoft Windows 98 (not even \"SE\"!).  If you have a newer computer, you will have a hard time beating the Adobe Elements/Album combo that Amazon offers -- well-worth it!We originally considered paying list price at Be$t Buy in order to get an extended warranty, but we realized that if they go bad in France it won't help, so Amazon saved me a bundle.  THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE AFAIC TO BUY DIGI-CAMS AT THIS LEVEL THAN AMAZON.  MEMORY CARDS, TOO.Me, I'm waiting to see how Sony's new W1 looks (I like the huge movie resoultion it offers, perhaps Canon's only weak area compared to the compettion).  If the Sony doesn't do anything for me, then I'll probably go with an A75 for myself -- the S410 is an awesome little cam, but it's a bit uncomfortable in my hands and the screen is only 1.5\" which is another weakness compared to the competition.  If they had a 1.8\" LCD on the S410 I'd go with it so I could have a great (but not as versatile) cam I could keep in my pocket -- heavy though it is.I hope this helped.  The world of digicams is tough, and changing fast.  With that said, I don't think you can go wrong with the A75.  The S410 is also great (weaknesses noted) but you can get something similar from the competion for $100 less (alhtough you'll sacrifice a bit in picture quality).Good luck!

In the past, i have owned two digital cameras; a Fuji 2600 and a Kodak DX4330.  The Canon A75 has far surpasses both of these cameras COMBINED.  The camera is very easy to use, and the image quality is GREAT.  It comes with a 32mb card which can hold 50+ pictures at the highest quality, and over 300 pictures in the absolute lowest.  Then there are several size and quality intervals giving varing numbers of pictures.  Not only are the pictures great but the batteries last FOREVER!!  I purchases a set of Monster Power cells (NIMH batteries 2100mah), and put them in my camera.  I then took my camera with me on a trip to new york, and they lasted from 5 AM  all the way to 11:30 at night with the LCD and Redeye Flash on for every picture.  Even at 11:30 when i got home again, the camera was still going strong.  The best part is, that i NEVER had to change the batteries once the entire time.  I got over 125 pictures, plus the added minutes of scrolling through the pictures.  At first, i was sceptical that a camera with a 1.8\" LCD and powerful flash could last this long but I took a chance, based on Canon's reputation.  And a great payoff it was.  The Canon A75 is a terrific camera, and I would recomend it to anyone who is in the market for a digital camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Absolutely outstanding camera - amazing for its class", "Author": "Jordan Steele", "ReviewID": "REOLQZ1XDXRKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a Kodak DX3400 for about 3 years now, and it came time to upgrade...I wanted a compact point and shoot that had some extra options to take creative photos.  As a hobbyist photographer, I managed to get some fantastic photos out of my old Kodak, but it took horrible photos in low light and took poor action shots.  After much research and comparison at some fantasic review sites, I decided on the PowerShot A75.  I am NOT disappointed.The Canon Powershot A75 is everything I wanted in a point and shoot.  It's small (but comfortable in your hands), has plenty of resolution for point and shoot abilities (great prints up to 8x10) and has enough manual options to take nearly every type of shot.  I did some serious experimentation, and found that even in very low light situations, the camera can either capture what it really looks like, or, by using the shutter priority, you can get vibrant, full color shots that look like they were captured in bright daylight. (I photographed my entryway at 9:45 PM, with dusk filtering in through windows 18 feet away, and got a vibrant, perfectly exposed photo...amazing)The auto mode is good, but should really only be used by inexperienced users...the best shots come from taking advantage of the Scene modes (the indoor scene setting takes PERFECT indoor shots, with perfect exposure, white balance, and color saturation).  The portrait mode opens the aperture way up to capture the subject in crisp detail while blurring the background, and it goes on and on.  In addition to the Scene modes, there's also a 'fast shutter' and 'slow shutter' mode which are fantastic for taking action shots or blurring moving water, respectively, without having to worry about setting the shutter speed and aperture.There's also a movie mode and a PhotoStitch mode.  The movies are good quality for a still camera, though nowhere near the quality of a digital camcorder.  The PhotoStich mode assists you in taking panoramic photos, by showing your last photo and letting you line up the next shot with the first one, so the included PhotoStitch software can automatically merge them on the computer.  The panoramas work quite well, and preserve the exposure of the first shot, which limits color variation.  The photo stitch software took about 10 seconds to stitch 9 photos together and create the single panorama.The manual controls are fantastic.  Custom white balance for oddly lit areas is extremely easy to use (though the preset white balances and the auto do quite well).  Manual focus is outstanding, and can be used in conjunction with any other mode, except full auto.  I used it to take great clear photos of my darkened treeline in the moonlight, and got a crisp, beautiful photo.  Full manual is tricky if you aren't used to adjusting shutter speed and aperture together, but it will let you know if the camera settings will over or under expose the image (though you can still take the shot).At the slower shutter speeds, you do need to be steady, so a tripod or setting the camera down helps enormously for night or time exposure shots, but that's the case with any camera.  To aid in steadying the camera for these long exposures, the camera has a 2 second self timer in addition to the standard 10 second...so you can take photos without having the jitter from pressing the shutter.  That said, in good lighting, the camera is fine to treat like any other point and shoot, and with a fast shutter, you can get crisp images with the camera bouncing all over the place.  Shots taken while riding in a car are very crisp and clear while using the 'fast shutter' mode.Overall, I am extremely impressed.  For the price, this camera is just outstanding.  In my opinion, you don't need more than 3MP for a point and shoot, so this is a great buy.  One thing that I would do, though, is buy a mini tripod to put in your pocket so you can get great photos at night.  A larger memory card would be nice too, but I already had a 128MB from my old camera, so I didn't need to worry about it.  I'd say this is the best point and shoot for the money.", "Date": "June 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best in class", "Author": "Sam Park", "ReviewID": "RN1XVMOHYKFUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a moderately priced digicam with manual features to flex your artistic side I don't think you can go wrong with Canon's A75. With a sub $200 retail price this go any where camera beats larger megapixel competitors with better color fidelity and expansive manual controls. However there are a few flaws in the design. Although you get a low battery indicator a battery meter is missing. This kind of makes you guess how much juice you have left before the low battery warning comes on. Not a deal breaker but a weird design flaw that should be remedied. The plastic door for the memory slot is a bit flimsy in design but does its job well. As a matter of fact the whole camera is made of plastic. I don't think this is a design flaw since it is high quality plastic and does reduce it's overall weight but does have a bit of a cheap feel to it. For anyone getting this camera as a first digital you NEED to buy 2 things. A larger CF memory card. Don't waste your money on ultra speed products. There's only a hand full of prosumer digicams that can take advantage of the extra speed, save your money and buy more megabytes. A 512MB CF card is nice but a 1GB card is better. Some people might think this is over kill but when you're not limited in the number of pictures you can take you can really start having fun and sort out the true winners out of them all. Another must is a couple of sets (pair of 4 AAs) of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a good charger. Don't get cheap here as there is a real difference in the amount of pictures you can take between an 1850mAh and 2300mAh batteries. Maha and energizer make dependable batteries. As for chargers the best is made by Maha. One last note about the Canon A75. As with any digital camera check for \"dead\", \"stuck\" or \"hot\" pixels in the CCD. You know you have it if you see any red or white pixels that show up in most or all of your shots. If you see this send it back for an exchange.

French \"Well hello there, fellow Amazon sh...", "ReviewID": "RTBSXOP9M5GDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my A75, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed. I've been taking pictures ever since I was 10 (my first camera was a Kodak 126 cartridge model with the flip flash). We have a Canon EOS digital Rebel, which is awesome. That said, I wanted something smaller to tote around, and the A75 fills the bill nicely.Initial ImpressionsThis baby is ready to use right out of the box. Although reading the manual is advisable prior to using any new gear, I found the camera's controls to be quite intuitive (perhaps owing to my experience with the EOS). Once you install the included batteries and 32mb CF card, you're ready to start taking pictures. There are many options for various shooting situations (sport mode, portrait, etc.), as well as a \"scene\" mode for more specialized scenarios such as \"snow\", \"fireworks\", and \"foliage\". The creative zone settings enable the most control I've ever seen in a camera of this class, all the way down to full manual exposure and focus control. Using manual controls can make the camera work faster. For example, go into manual mode, set the focus around 2 feet and f2.8. Everything from 2 feet to infinity will be in focus, and you can zing off hip shots quickly. Although there is no metering in manual mode, the LCD will preview your shot (if your settings are wrong the preview will look too dark, too light, or too blurry). Exposure compensation controls are quickly accessible in most modes. There are three different metering modes, you can adjust the ISO rating of the sensor, and choose from one of several color balance presets (tungsten, fluorescent, etc.), and even define your own. It's got a rapid-fire mode, and can even take short videos with sound. The more you read the manual and play with this camera, the deeper you can get into the feature set, and it's pretty dang deep. Quite a lot of bang for the buck.PROS1. Excellent image quality.2. Ease of use.3. Lots of features in a relatively small package.4. High overall quality, good solid feel.5. Uses standard AA batteries.CONS1. Size and weight not quite suitable for shirt pocket. Jacket pocket or purse will be fine.2. Some shutter lag, which varies depending on selected mode. Not bad for a camera of this type, but certainly not on a par with, say, an SLR.Although the A75 comes with software, I must recommend Adobe Photoshop Elements. It has a very nice capture feature and photo-organizer that makes managing your image library a pleasure. The editing features are quite extensive, and easy to use with many tutorials and liberal assistance. It's even got a feature that can stitch together the \"photo stitch\" panoramas from the A75. All in all, PS Elements works a treat with the A75 (and the EOS, for which it offers RAW file support).", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Way to go Canon!", "Author": "Shoe Princess", "ReviewID": "RF6XRB4LRVUUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Kodak DC3200 that was purchased two years ago that I am very pleased with and still works to this day.  However, the door to the battery compartment no longer closes so I have to use rubber bands tied around the camera to keep the batteries in place (annoying); the batteries are always falling out!  The other problem was the lag time between when you actually press the button and the seconds that pass before the image is actually recorded.  This is problematic because I mostly take pictures of my toddler who is always in motion.This is where the Canon A75 enters the picture.  I did not want to spend a fortune.  I do not have to have the biggest and the best.

So far I've only taken pictures using the \"Auto\" setting and I've gotten some great shots!  This camera is super-easy to use.

The camera is very simple to use and it's very easy to navigate from one setting to another using the mode dial on top of the camera. It is also very simple to quickly transfer images from the camera to your computer - just attach the usb cable to the camera and pc and the camera does the rest. When using the automode, the image quality is very good to excellent when taking photos outside on a bright sunny day. Subjects come out in-focus and the automatic exposure does a great job of getting the colors just right. Pictures taken indoors are also very good if the camera is close to the subject(within the range of the flash) although some of the shots come out slightly overexposed which is not a problem and can be easily fixed with minor tweaking and the camera set to program mode. Now for the bad. The auto-mode is practically useless when taking night shots or even some shots taken on very cloudy days or in areas where there tend to be lots of shadows. The pictures come out very noisy. Apparently the camera increases the ISO value to compensate for the low-light condition and the larger the ISO value the greater the amount of noise in the picture. As mentioned above, it seems to increase the ISO value even on cloudy days or in shadowy areas leading to noisy pictures. I have minimized the affect of noise in low-light conditions by using the cameras program mode and setting the ISO value to its lowest setting which is 50 on this camera. This dramatically reduces the noise. The problem of noise seems to be a problem on all digital cameras in this category and  price not just the canon a75. If your searching for a camera that will give you less noise look for one that has a bigger sensor (1/1.8\" instead of 1/2.7\") although that will cost more. I've been looking at the canon a80 which has a bigger sensor and the pictures seem to come out not as noisy. Another bad part of the camera is that it is impossible to see the LCD screen when the sun is very bright. The folks at Canon should've coated the LCD with an anti-reflection coating to minimize the glare. But anyway what matters most is the picture quality which is good but not great.

Now I'm upgrading for the 3rd time to the A75 (the A85 is just too much).  Here's the amazing thing: with the last two PowerShots (A40 and A60), I took *over 5500* pictures and neither one coughed once.  I sold the A40 6 months ago (after 4000 pics) and the current owner says it's still running like a champ.  This line of digital cameras is the best thing going for the price.  My Dad and brother both seem to insist on buying Nikon cameras.  Then, every time we get together for the holidays, all I hear is \"I wish my camera did that\" or \"Can I get a copy of your picture?  It looks better.\"  This camera sports features that even $400 cameras don't (I know, because I gave the other manufacturers an honest chance to get me to leave Canon this time, but they just couldn't offer anything comparable).Now, I'm no dummy when it comes to photography.  I've been an SLR user for many, many years (currently, I have a Canon EOS Rebel).  Unfortunately, digital SLR's are still too expensive.  I bought the Powershot because of the full manual mode (I do a lot of astrophotography and this is perfect for it).  I have total control over the settings.  Combined with a 52mm lens adapter, this camera satisfies 90% of my SLR cravings.  The pictures are consistently crisp and well exposed.  I rarely encounter a situation where the PowerShot isn't able to rock and roll.  Battery life is stunning.  I routinely get 500 pictures with the LCD on and maybe 30% flash (I have 2100 mAh NiMHs).  Added features such as 600x480 movies, a really sharp panoramic mode (photos are \"stitched\" together on the computer), manual white-balancing option, histograms, manual focus, aperture/shutter priority modes and PictBridge printing are icing on the cake.The one con I've found is that the Powershot line seems to perform a bit sluggishly in low-light conditions, often requiring a few seconds to get a decent reading.This really is THE best camera in its class(IMO and that of many \"professional\" reviewers).

After looking at the Olympus D540 zoom, and Nikon Coolpix 3200, I settled on the Canon PowerShot A75.All of the other reviewers are correct in assessing the pros and cons for this camera.  The 3X Optical Zoom is great, but the zoom ring is located on top of the camera around the shutter release.  Takes some getting used to since the Coolpix 2000 zoom lever is on the back within easy thumb range.  Another plus is the camera has both an LCD screen and a more conventional conventional viewfinder.  After 25 years of composing through a viewfinder, I'm used to it, and use the LCD screen to review my pics and check and adjust the camera settings.  Even though I plan to use it primarily as a point-and-shoot, there are lots of options for manual adjustments, more than you would expect for a camera at this size and price.What finally sold me on this camera, was that it takes CF memory cards, and I already have several that I use with the Minolta and the Nikon.  Therein lies the only problem so far, since my memory card reader, built into my PC, will not read the 32Mb card that came with the camera.  But, the cards I already own work just fine.This is a great second camera for the enthusiast, and a great entry level camera for someone making the switch to digital photography and is used to having more control over the camera settings.

This camera rocks. For [...](on Amazon) you can't beat it with any other in its class or even till 5 megapixel (unless you want larger then 8x10 prints).I,like most of you reading this review, agonised over which one to buy. It is just frustrating. There are so many options out there and after a while brain just gives up. My shortlist looked something like this : A75,A95,Fuji E550(6.3 mp , $250 after rebate at buydig.com)A95, IMO, has more noise than A75. Also its bulky and it always shakes while pushing bit too hard snap button. Only great thing with this one is its swivel LCD. Resolution on LCD is extremely good. I liked images more on it than my flat panel PC monitor.E550, seems to be excellent price as well, for 250 after rebate, this one is too tempting. But I thought Canon powershot is safer buy. Just because so many people have bought it and have given good reviews.A75 is loaded with features, for the price it just offers unbelievably rich feature set. It has Aperture,shutter,manual mode, exposure compensation, white balance compensation, 3 metering modes, tons of special situation modes, addictive photostitching mode.Image quality is excellent. I could not believe how crisp images it produces. Color are vivid, shadow details are great. In fact I think, colors are little more satuaated than they are. You dont need polariser to get a dark blue sky.Battery life is amazing, around 400 images with LCD on and moderate use of review mode.This review caan go on and on, just because I am impresses a lot with this camera. I just hope this lasts good. Body is plastic and I am scared of this E14... error people keep mentioning.To summarize, I would say , if you are looking for a digital camera that you can comfortably carry anywhere and take good quality pictures then search no further.

The battery life is another great thing about this camera, it last the whole day, literally! But when you buy your memory card make sure to by at least a 128mb so you don't have to worry about erasing cute pics. But the 32mb card it comes with is a special bonus!

The most noticeable is the larger LCD, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, \"C\" dial position to save your custom settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc. The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you want 5 megapixels of resolution, a very useful rotating LCD screen, and Flexi-Zone (lets you choose an area that is off-center to focus on), then look at the A95.Remember, Higher Megapixels do not always equal better picture quality, or better cameras.

There are a lot of great detailed reviews here about every feature . . . I'm going to just talk about what I think matters with this camera.#1 - Picture Quality.  I have a HP 2.1 MP camera that I just used to take a picture of my sons under the Christmas tree, then printed it out on photo paper.  When I got my Canon A75 camera, I took the same picture of them, then printed it out.  The difference was stunning!  The color and quality of the Canon printed picture was 10x better than the HP.  It looked like a photo center picture.#2 - Software.  It's okay, but not the best. For organizing and viewing after downloading, it's fine. I wanted to print a picture, and all I could find was Album printing and \"contact sheet\".  It didn't give me size option (4x6, 5x7, etc.)  I ended up using my HP Printer software.#3 - Fun Stuff.  There are some fun things - like sounds.  When you are in the Canon software, you can go to \"My camera options\" and change the sounds and opening screen picture (while your camera is connected).  I have a nice Christmas scene for the opening picture and some cute Christmas sound effects.  They have other themes like baseball, cats/dogs, wedding, etc.#4 - My biggest problem with this camera is shutter speed.  It takes a few seconds to actually take a picture.  By the time my kids are done saying \"CHEESE\" the picture snaps.  So I've learned to tell them to say cheese a second after I push the button.  I have a feeling I'm going to miss some good shots because of this issue.#5 - Batteries.  Sure, it eats batteries, but all digital cameras do.  But comparing it to my HP, the Canon A75 lasts twice as long.  And does even better with a good set of rechargable batteries.I would surely recommend this camera.

But, unlike many other point and shoot digitals, this Canon allows you to control the shutter, aperture, and focus manually.I am pleased with the lens on this camera, but it is not a stand-out feature. The zoom is adequate most of the time. Just don't expect it to catch any real macro or telephoto shots.Overall picture quality is excellent and colors are bright and accurate. You can now buy consumer digital cameras with 8 or more megapixel CCDs, but save your money. This camera's 3.2MP will be enough for 90% of consumers.

The included alkaline AA batteries lasted less than two days. I purchased a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and they have lasted much longer and can be recharged in 30 minutes.

I have had the Rebel for many years and it has been a wonderful camera and has never let me down.  I have probably shot thousands of photos with it.  I recommend Canon cameras as my personal choice.  I read many reviews before buying this camera and I believed it would serve me well for many years.  Five or six months after I purchased it developed the same problem it has now.  I brought it back to Best Buy but it started working the minute it got into the technician's hands.  It has worked fine up until last week, 11 months after I purchased it, 1 month out of warranty.  Given the failure mode I would think that this is an electronic problem, not a mechanical one.  When the shutter release is fully depressed the meter boxes come up but the shutter does not release.  Without moving the camera or changing any settings I press the shutter release again and a different set of meter boxes show up.  The camera focuses just fine and beeps to indicate focus has been achieved.  Also, the IR Focus assist comes on even though it is turned off in the menu.I am extremely disappointed that this camera has not lasted longer.  Canon Customer Service said it is going to cost me $79 or more to have it repaired.  What is to say it will not have the same failure a year from now?  They offered an A95 for $149 + $10 shipping.  Why would I spend $159 on a camera \"upgrade\" that has the same potential for failure and disappointment?I searched Google for \"canon a75 problem\" and found this website:[...]On this page alone there are 2 reviews that indicate the same failure that I am experiencing and possibly a third but the reviewer did not elaborate.  This is just my first stop in my search and I have already found a trend.  Both of the reviewers said they would not purchase a Canon product again.Canon has had such a good reputation in the industry and I hate to see it wasted on poor decision not to repair an obvious factory defect.  Charging customers for poor quality control will lead to fewer and fewer sales in the future.  I have been saving to purchase a digital EOS but after this experience I believe I may have to put my trust in another manufacturer.I believe Canon's reliability department has already found the trend (heck, I found it in .005 seconds) and possibly the source of this failure.

The A75 still may still be found in some retailers inventories - and factory reconditioned units are still available at great prices. You should still consider the A75 as a great entry level camera.]As a Defense Contractor, and the owner of a Canon Digital Rebel, I wanted a backup camera that would not cause much attention to be paid to me or my camera - here or in some parts of the world. Looking at price point and sharing of compact flash memory cards were two prime considerations in camera choice.I'm partial to Canon digital products. Fit, finish and performance at every level of purchase price make them dependable buys. I've not been disappointed in any of my 3 cameras, printers or 3 lenses purchased from Canon.The A75 camera takes marvelous daylight pictures - and pretty good flash pictures. It has enough control features to satisfy even advanced photographers like myself. With a Canon made underwater housing (purchased while scuba diving in Aruba WP-DC30 ... see my review) it allows me to go places no other camera I own will take me.Movie mode is limited. Although good for some - the picture quality and lack of zoom features says - get a camcorder! Redeye is a distinct problem in lowlight and all flash modes. The lens/flash position allows only a narrow angle of satisfactory picture taking. Redeye reduction might be effective -but I haven't seen it work acceptably. Plan to spend time in Photoshop or other software products to remove what the camera has created.Shutter and auto-focus lag time. Most disconcerting. Sometimes the camera hunts forever. Even in controlled circumstances - the processor speed (or lack thereof) becomes annoying. Most disappointing feature of this camera.Plan on purchasing Ni-Mh recharable AA batteries. This camera - while not a battery hog - will drain your wallet with non-rechargables. A spare (2nd) set is a good bet - if this is your only camera - and you take a lot of pictures.Case and lens ring wear is evident after 18 months of use. Dirt and grit can get into the zoom lens mechanism in high dirt/dust environments. A mini-vac or air blower bottle has become a permanent fixture in my camera kit.Buy a camera pouch that firmly holds the A75, and has a separate compartment for a spare set of 4 AA batteries. I share compact flash memory with my Digital Rebel. A 512mb high speed card - and you can shoot forever. 250-300 pictures in full quality on a 512mb card is possible.After 18 months of use - I'm more than satisfied. The camera is starting to be phased out by many retailers. A reconditioned A75 would make a great entry level camera at a great price.As critical as I've been - I LIKE this camera.

I thought this was going to be a problem for me, but after trying it, I hardly noticed. It actually comes as an advantage, because when pressing the button, you exert force on the camera, and this can cause motion, so by the time camera is back in perfect position it takes the picture and it comes out fine. It may sound like a long time, but really its only about 1 second or less.The camera build quality is very good, it feels strong and somewhat heavy, which may be a problem for shirt pockets, but it feels good.In comparison to another camera I have used within the same price range and also 3.2 megapixels (I will not name the brand), it is like 10x better.

For the high-end, the Nikon is incredible.  For the low-end, my all-time favorite has been the Canon A70.I liked it so much, that when my first one was stolen on vacation, I purchased another one.  It has the best feature set of any digital camera under $300.Unfortunately, my second Canon A70 took a swim at a water park...and was never quite the same.  So I replaced my A70 with the A75 this month.Almost everything appeared equal between the A75 and A70.  And the Picture quality continued to be very good for both.  However, this camera has one show-stopping problem that I cannot live with.  It has the worst auto-focus mechanism of any digicam I've owned.  I take lots of pictures of my kids, and the A75 cannot keep up with them.  What I can't understand is how did Canon make the auto-focus worse in the A75 than the A70?I compared my A75 with floor models at a local electronics chain, and discovered they were all equally poor.

So the picture you took his dark too dark to use.  Just drop your shutter speed from 1/250 of a second to 1/125 of a second this will let in more light.

And lo and behold, Amazon dropped the price of A75 by a whopping 40 dollars to make it the best deal available on the net.(Hats off Amazon!) Of course, I bought the camera at Amazon with the super saver FREE shipping it reached me 4-5 days later!I had loved my A70 and now A75 offers all that and more:- A larger 1.8 inch LCD screen, what a difference it makes when you don't have to squint to see the image and it works better in low light situations too- New SCN modes for quick shots of special scenes - Fireworks, Beach, Snow, Underwater (with the waterproof case), Foliage and Indoors. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot quickly before they miss the photo opportunity. I haven't had the opportunity to test out all the modes, but will report back with an update soon.- Print share button to directly download/print from camera, though I don't think I will ever print the images directly from my cameraI LOVE the new control buttons at the back, the way the SET button is now in the center of the up-down/forward-backward navigator buttons. Now, the navigator buttons are also clearly marked with arrows to avoid confusion. The overall feel is more ergonomic than the A70, which is great. A small gripe is that the rubber flap that covers the A/V out and Digital port is slightly larger than on my A80, but it is not very noticeable.What is great about the CANON A75 (which hasn't changed since the A70):--A75 also offers 3 resolution settings for video including 640X480 (VGA max 30 sec). With yahoo/gmail etc. now allowing larger attachments, it is fun to send small clips of video to people.--Complete Manual functions available - shutter priority, Aperture priority, White balancing, Manual focusing etc.--Photostitch - For stitching together panoramic views. I have shot countless seascapes, 'bridge'scapes, landscapes etc using this function and stitching togehter 6-10 shots in one. It is really easy too with the software provided which does it intuitively!-- Tone settings (Tungsten, Sunlight, Cloudy etc.) which help correct the White balance--Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I have used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors.--Free Canon software, which works well and allows you to edit images, photo-stitch images, make fun photos, maintain an album, change camera settings from your computer, subtitle and edit videos, upload images back to camera to transfer to another computer etc.--It uses AA batteries which are available anywhere in the world.NOTE: A Sony Super Quick Charger (5 hours) with 4 rechargeable 2300mAH NiMH batteries is available for under $19 on Amazon! Charge these batteries upto 1000 times. I keep the LCD on for all my shots and usually I get 300-360 shots from each charge from the A75 including the battery power used to download these images to my computer with the USB cable and playing back these images for friends! That is quite a feat by Canon.--Macro mode - Great for close ups of children or product shotsAt the current price on Amazon it is quite simply one of the best cameras you can buy. First time digital camera buyers will find it very easy to use as will those who want to experiment a bit with the manual features available on the AXX range of Canon cameras. If you want a decent, reasonably priced camera that is versatile enough for photography buffs and gives you crystal clear 5X7 prints - go for this camera.About the complaints on this camera from other reviers-E18 - I have had an A70 where I did get an E18 error once in a while but I just turned the camera on and off and it went away. I never had this problem on the A80 in 2 years and nor on the A75. So maybe Canon has taken care of it now.Quality of prints - I have had crystal clear prints from Canon, yes the pics look the same on the computer even if they are low resolution. So make sure you are using the larger modes like L /M1 when you want to print the pictures.Delayed response to pressing the 'take picture' button - ALL Canon Cameras have this as they send out an infra red beam to evaluate the light conditions, so you must hold the camera still 2-3 seconds after depressing the button. This feature gives perfect pictures each time but if you give your camera to strangers just tell them to hold it still 5 secs after they have pressed the button. After all the pic quality is worth the effort.So go on - get it NOW before it sells out around Christmas!", "Date": "October 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "Daniel A.

This was my first \"real\" digital camera (because I had used a simple free one before with very low quality pictures at 640*480 resolution) and I really liked how it was easy to use and had a clear and colorful 1.8\" LCD screen on the back.We originally had the 32 megabyte memory card with the camera, which can hold enough pictures (the storage depends on the resolution of the pictures, however 32 megabytes is good for about 100 pictures at decent resolution). My brothers and I mainly used the camera to take pictures of awesome sports cars and rare foreign cars such as old vintage Porsches, Dodge Vipers, and Lamborghinis (we participated in what we dubbed drive-by-shootings, where we would drive by and take pictures of rare and awesome cars, and now our collection has over 1000 pictures). The pictures were generally very good quality, but the problem is that this camera is very susceptible to movements while taking a picture.  Therefore, many of the pictures come out blurry. However, there are many modes for the camera, such as outdoor mode, action mode, indoor mode, night mode. These modes help when you're taking action shots, but unless you have a tripod there are too many pictures that will come out blurry.The zoom capabilities of this camera were a pretty cool feature, although 3X zoom is fairly common on digital cameras. The menus and options are generally easy to use, and you can get by without learning about all the advanced features if you just want basic pictures. However, I suggest that you get the 512 megabyte memory card, because then you can store an almost unlimited number of pictures. With this card, at high resolution you can store over 700 pictures, and if you opt for the email-friendly low resolutions pictures at 640*480 (which come out looking pretty good) you can store thousands of pictures. This is great for overseas trips or for convenience because you don't have to keep uploading to your PC. Also a 512 MB or 1 GB memory card is great for taking videos.This camera also takes short videos, which are actually impressive quality for a digital camera of this price. The sound quality is pretty decent also, and the videos are either 320*240 or 640*480. With our 512 MB card we could take a video of about 20 minutes at the lower resolution.By now you're probably wondering why I gave this camera 3 stars. Well, after having this camera for about a year it had a major failure. I was using it to zoom in and out at one of my brother's school award ceremony and then the LCD image just became very blurry. From then on, the LCD monitor was constantly blurry and all the pictures became blurry. So after that we couldn't take any more pictures. Now the camera is ruined, and with our warranty expired we'll have to probably get it repaired at a high cost. Hopefully, the new Canon Powershot A90 doesn't have this serious malfunction. There are many other excellent Canon cameras to purchase, but I don't suggest this one unless you get at least a 2-year warranty and perhaps use the zoom sparingly.", "Date": "August 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "great first digital camera!", "Author": "Jamie Young", "ReviewID": "R3HKIQ5854Z0DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The digital camera market is very vast these days, and after researching and reading the rave reviews of the A75 on amazon, my decision was an easy one.

There was no guarantee that the memory card error would not come back and delete the pictures or make them inaccessible, so I never left pictures on the camera for more than a few minutes.  This made using the camera outside of the house pretty much impossible.Eventually even the complicated button mashing was no longer enough.  It was all memory card error, all the time.

Once I figured out that simultaneously holding down the power and set buttons would let me turn the camera on, I contacted Canon support.  I told them that I was getting a memory card error and that the camera was very difficult to turn on.The response that I got was to reset it to the factory settings, and if that didn't work then I would have to send the camera in to them to repair.

I've had this camera for two years and it has performed wonderfully.  At one point my brother dropped it from about six feet onto concrete and it hasn't affected performance at all.  The 3.2 megapixel is more than enough to print great quality pictures ... I've printed mostly 4x6 and 5x7.  I think this is a great point and shoot digital camera, and it's a nice bonus to have the movie mode.There are a few limitations ...It guzzles battery power, particularly if you use the display all the time, which leads me to another point ... if you try to save battery power and sight photos through the viewfinder, the picture will be quite different than you think.  The only way to truly compose a photo to be exactly what you want is to use the display screen, which again causes short battery life.  Since it uses AA, I would recommend buying some rechargeable batteries, which is what I did.Another drawback is that it doesn't take good action shots.  There's a delay of about one second when you push the shutter button, particularly if the subject is moving and the AF won't lock.  You can hold the shutter button halfway to lock focus, but sometimes the subject has moved out of focus.  So, if you want to shoot a lot of action stuff, this might not be the camera for you.Another thing that I'm conscious of when I shoot with this camera is it's photo dimensions.  This camera offers image quality/proportions of 2048x1536, 1600x1200 and 640x480 ... all of which are basically 4x3.  So, if you want to any common print sizes - 4x6, 5x7, etc. - you have to go in and crop some off each photo.  If you can't do this manually, you photo processor will likely do it themselves without much care, taking equally from the top and bottom of shots, which might cut something you really want in the picture (like people's heads).  So, I have to be very careful now when I take pictures that I include enough space to make that crop.Overall though, I think this camera is worth the money.  It does a lot and has a lot of great features, but if you buy it you should be aware of its limitations.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "My first digital camera.", "Author": "S.

Canon's had a defective image sensor in several of the products they sold from roughly 2003-2005, the A75 included. Btw the sensor itself was made by Sony. But the good news was that Canon gave away Free repairs until Jan of 2012 for the A75 when they ran out of parts.  So just be aware if you buy an A75 and have the purple ccd problem you'll need to buy the sensor off ebay and then do the repair yourself or pay someone to do it for you IF you end up ever having that problem.Regarding the A75 itself, it is still to this day a great camera. The only thing separating it from a 2012 camera is it doesn't have an absurd number of megapixels you'll never use and has a small screen. Plus it's obviously chunkier than a 2012 model. In it's time period it was one of the very best pocket camera you could buy. Plus it has Full manual controls and to top it off was affordable. Full manual controls on affordable pocket cameras simply do not exist today, period.If you are wondering about using a 3MP camera in 2012, the bottom line is people don't even print photos anymore for the most part. They put them on Facebook etc. Even if you do want to print, I've made great 8x10 prints with this 3MP camera. Now they will tell you that you need XX number of Megapixels to print 8x10 etc but I promise you that this camera makes perfect 4x6 and 5x7 prints and great 8x10 prints. Just keep in mind the potential ccd issue which may or may not affect you. The only reason this camera gets 4 out of 5 is the potential ccd issue.

It has all the settings of my old SLR Canon A1 (i.e. shutter speed or aperture priority, manual mode) plus a load of new digital ones (e.g. black and white, sepia, vivid etc...).+ Battery life is very good if you get some decent rechargeables.+ Nice big, crystal clear screen.+ Uses flash memory, which seems cheaper than the other formats.+ Movie mode is good fun and surprisingly good quality on the high setting.Bad Points:------------ A little bit bulky.- I've noticed that the image through the viewfinder and the screen don't always match. The one on the screen is the accurate one, which is annoying as in bright conditions it's not always easy to see.- Works best in light conditions. I find it sometimes struggle to get the exposure right when using the flash. So use a tripd where you can.Summary-------A very versatile (and quite tough) camera that with a little effort gets great results. I would'nt recommend it for people just looking for a point and click, there are plenty of smaller, lighter cameras that will take just as good pictures.

This camera is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  It's small and comfortable to hold, and it packs a big punch of features. I was previously a point and shooter all the way, so I'm new to manual settings, but I haven't shot anything in auto mode since I bought this camera a month ago.Set up properly, it takes awesome shots in almost every scenario you can throw at it.  If you are interested in learning manual controls, there is no better camera out there for the money that can do what this one can.If you're someone who just wants to strictly point and shoot, it's still a great choice because the image quality is right up there.  When you feel comfortable with the camera, you can then experiment with the manual controls and I guarantee you will want to keep learning more. Oh and the movie mode rocks too. I'd hook up with at least a 128MB or better memory card though because it only comes with a 32MB card and if you take shots at the superfine rez, you won't have alot of room for images on the 32 meg card.  I'd also recommend at least one set of 2300 mah batteries. I got two sets plus a 3 hr. Maha charger that works like a champ. You definitely won't be disappointed with this camera, and CF memory is reasonably priced, so a larger card won't cost you a mint.  I put 4 pages of images online from this camera. You can view them at [...] Bottom line is, the Canon A75 will not disappoint if you just take the time to LEARN how to use it...start by reading the manual. These people who are saying they've got fuzzy images are not setting up the camera properly, and probably have the digital zoom engaged, which will produce fuzzy looking photos.  As you may know from research, digital zoom is just hype and pretty useless.  It's not rocket science folks, rtfm and you'll get great shots from this canon.

Let me share with you the reasons I chose the A75:1) Resolution:  With digital cameras getter \"better\" all the time 3.2 mp does not seem like a real high quality photo anymore.  This is not true for the average camera user.  I have a 2.1 mp Olympus that I blow up to 8X10 with no noticable loss of clarity.  I am sure that the 3.2 will follow suit and is sufficient for the use of the wife.  The main thing to remember is that the higher the pixel resolution, the larger the file size as a trade-off.2) Batteries - I am a firm believer of the AA NiMH batteries and thier associated chargers.  I was able to get the wife an Engrgizer charger with eight batteries for about $20, which will last forever.  The other nice thing is that in a pinch any set of AA batteries, available literally anywhere, will keep you shooting.3) Storage media - I prefer the compact flash media for one main reason, durability.  The hard case with no external contacts make for a long lasting memory card.  I personnaly like the size as well since some of the newer cards are so small they would be easily misplaced.  The second reason I like compact flash is cost.  [...]4) Size -  The wife loves the way the A75 fits in her hand, unlike my Olympus.  The battery area forms a nice handle on the right side of the camera which fits her small hands just right.  The over all compactness of the camera is great too.  I figure the smaller the camera, the more likely we will actually have it with us to take pictures.4) Brand - It's a Canon, after all.  Nuff said about that...5) Features - I have barely explored half of what the camera is capable of, but I am surprised at the depth it offers.  Yet, the automatic mode is simple enough for the wife to \"point and shoot\" with exellent results.That's about it, I recommend this camera, from Amazon.com, to anyone looking to buy today!Update August 2008:  The camera died a week before Christmas 2007.

This is excellent for beginners who aspire to develop their photography skills but aren't ready to commit to the higher end SLRs like the Rebel.Many people don't like the autofocus boxes. Over the years I've learned to manipulate them so they aren't quite the hinderence they could be. You just gotta learn how to trick the camera to focus on what you want- I use my hand, its the best tool to get the autofocus boxes to move to where you want it to go. Obviously that adds more time to the setting up process of a shot.For fast spur-of-the-moment pics, you'll either want to turn that feature off or switch over to auto. The hard part with auto of course, you can't control the fstop and iso settings as well as you can in manual.

I have owned it for 3 years, and it has not failed me. It takes AMAZING pictures in lowlight settings. As someone who much prefers natural light to using a flash, that is an important feature for me. I also have found that the 3.2 megapixel ability of the camera is fine. I don't plan on printing over 20x30 sized prints, which I am able to do with this camera (according to photo printing websites).The macro lens is a nice feature, and it works well, although sometimes I have a difficult time seeing on the LCD screen if it's in focus. LCD screens never seem to be sharp enough.The video function is pretty good. The sound is recorded great. It is a little bouncy, though, if you don't hold your hands perfectly still, but I can record 3 minutes worth of video on this. Not too shabby. However, the light meter doesn't adjust as you record video. So, if you move from a dark area to a lighter area, it just overexposes, and vice versa if you start out somewhere bright and go into a dark room.All in all, it is a great camera. What you should be aware of in 2007: CF memory cards are getting harder to find. I luckily found a 1GB card for this in November 2006, but that was the only one they carried on a whole display of other kinds of cards. If I were you, I would check around and make sure you can find extra CF cards. The 32MB card that comes with it doesn't hold much at all. A positive: it uses AA batteries. If you travel to a foreign country, you can always find those. If you have a lithium battery in a camera that requires its own charger, you would have to bring a power adapter with you, etc, just to charge your battery. Get rechargeable AA's and you're set to go.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the price", "Author": "J.

It was thrown around in my sack or backpack and it did not fall apart or break, though it did show some cosmetic wear. I was impressed that it never mechanically broke and the camera worked flawlessly even after all the miles I put on it.I must have taken well over a 1000 pictures with the camera and the flash never dimmed but I did go through batteries much quicker at high quality settings. But at mid level (1024x768) and low res settings, the camera was very battery efficient.I was impressed by the quality of the pictures, very clean and very nice high quality images for the most part. I was also impressed with the high ISO sensitivity for indoor pics.  I took a bunch of indoor sports picks without a flash at high shutter speed with ISO mode and they turned out very well for a point and shoot camera. I was impressed for a cheap camera.

It is better to use rechargable batteries with this cameras, they last longer and don't need to be buying often. You should have two sets for when one runs dry you change them.Card Reader. Nowadays computers include them. If you can buy a Compact Flash Reader or Universal one. It will help you save battery life and time,because you don't have to set up camera drivers to connect the camera to your computer or install the software included with the camera.This is definitely a great deal, considering you can only get 3.2 MP cameras under 200 dollars if the have a digital zooom instead of an optical one, and use more expensive memory cards, and by the way you also get a 32 MB card instead of the usual 16 MB included in the box.

One thing I did know while doing research was that I wanted a Canon. I decided that I wanted a digital SLR for my artsy \"pro\" shots and a point-and-shoot for \"everyday\" use. For the SLR my decision was easy, a 10D (or whatever its successor is, I haven't purchased it yet). Deciding on a point-and-shoot was a bit more challenging. I didn't want to buy a point-and-shoot that was too high-end as I would soon be investing in an expensive SLR set-up. I was considering the higher-end G5 or the S1 IS. Honestly, the A75 wasn't even on my radar. Then one day the decision was made for me. I learned of an awesome deal for the A75 and it required that I act fast. I picked one up and immediately dove right into the user manual to learn all the capabilities that this digicam had in store for me. I was instantly impressed by all the features they crammed into this little 3.2 MP wonder, like the 13 shooting modes, which are much like presets for certain subject/scene situations. It has a large clear 1.8\" LCD to frame and preview your shots. The 9-point AI Auto Focus will ensure that your pictures are clear and sharp. I especially liked the fact that this camera could also be used in a fully manual mode. I enjoy tinkering with settings to get the optimal shot of a subject or scene. I'm one of those who don't mind setting a custom white balance (BTW, there are presets for that too!). Overall, I am VERY pleased with this product and would definitely recommend this camera for users new to digital photography or the seasoned veteran looking for a good point-and-shoot for those family gatherings.If you plan on purchasing the A75 I highly recommend getting rechargeable NiMH batteries. I own the Rayovac PS6 15 minute charger for use with their I-C3 15 minute rechargeable AA batteries. The ability to charge these batteries in 15 minutes has proven to be an indispensable feature for me.I would also recommend purchasing an extra compact flash card with a minimum of 128 MB.", "Date": "June 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "P.

It took great pictures, no complains there, great saturation and focus. About 11 months later it started to have glitches. At first it would auto switch from capture mode to playback mode, making it impossible to take pictures. Eventually the capture mode would kick in and after a few shots...bang!..all by itself the camera would switch to playback mode again. This was very annoying and it continued for awhile until recently.Now my camera only previews images that are stored in the memory card but CAN'T take pictures. The lens does not open no matter what I try.I have searched the internet intensively and discovered that I'm not alone; many people are experiencing similar situations.

There are jagged lines in the pictures when the lines should be smooth - a result of not using high enough resolution. The shades of color also don't transition smoothly - pixelation is evident when one color transitions to another (especially noticeable when there's shading).The film cameras I've owned (and I've owned some cheap ones) all took better quality photographs than my A75.If you plan on taking pictures and want to view them mainly on your computer monitor and don't have a need to print them out.
