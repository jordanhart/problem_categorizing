Knight \"JohnLKnight\"", "ReviewID": "R2IFKEUMXP9A9D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a very attractive camera, with lots of cool features and very good screen. However, the core function of a camera, for me, is to take pictures, and in this respect the Z20fd failed.I am not a `novice' user, but nor am I an expert. I don't even have the best eyesight in the world. I do not expect perfection from such a well priced product. However, it was clear to me from the outset that the picture quality on this camera was poor. Such was the good quality of the screen that I could tell without even downloading the pictures, that they were not good. When I downloaded them, they all clearly lacked definition and wereoverexposed. This was a couple of trial shots taken around the house and garden. I couldn't believe it! I therefore took a series of identical shots (on identical settings) with the Z20fd and my cheap old pocket Olympus (D-435). When the pictures were compared side-by-side, I was surprised to find that the Olympus was obviously better. I then showed the pictures to my wife, without telling her what camera took the pictures, and in every case she thought the Olympus was better.All the professional reviews of this camera agree that its picture quality is rubbish. I ignored them as I don't regard myself as expert enough to see or care about the imperfections they find. Instead, I decided to go with the all the positive feedback left here.Regrettably, I sent the Z20fd back and am looking for another camera. In the meantime I'll stick with my old Olympus. As I said, I am not one who expects the earth for a dime. I really wanted this snazzy little camera. But ultimately, it can't take a decent picture.(The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one, is that it has loads of cool features and a good screen, so good, in fact, I immediately saw how crap it's pictures were.)", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "My niece loved it!", "Author": "Ken E.", "ReviewID": "R3ADLCDGBZN6A6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was a birthday present to my 13 year old niece.  I work as a photographer AND as a representative for a competing camera manufacturer, so I was extremely sceptical that this camera would be suitable.My nieces eyes lit up when she opened the gift, and to my surprise she was able to use it immediately (the battery was charged at the factory?).She took dozens of pictures at her party, and didn't seem to have any problems with lag time, 'hunting' focus, or exposure problems that would be evident with most other cameras in the unusual lighting conditions where her party was held.Most importantly, it was easy to use.  She started using it immediately, which means that she didn't read the instruction book.

I like the colors, the looks, the MP and even the zoom is amazing for 3x.My only minor complaint is that of the slight delay on picture taking. If you are looking to capture a spur of the moment shot, you better allow yourself a couple seconds. (You should have a SLR or something for such anyway.)The camera's pictures are very fine on a computer screen, and the elimination of red eye is an awesome perk. The software that comes with the device isn't needed to get the pictures from the camera, but it is free and there, so what the heck.Movie quality is good, not Blue Ray (of course) but helps capture those moments when you forget your video camera. These videos can range in size depending on your memory card.The accessories are cheap (most of them) and I must advise you on getting a nice large memory card for extra pictures or movies space.All in all, Fujifilm does not dissapoint.

I needed a camera for my upcoming New Zealand vacation. I wanted a simple point and shoot inexpensive camera. After reading some online reviews this camera seemed to stand out as meeting or exceeding the expectations of previous buyers. I must fully agree! Amazon did an amazing job getting it to me in the color I wanted for much less than my local big box store. It arrived in two days! A brief battery charge, a quick read of the get started guide, and I felt ready! The camera performed flawlessly over the course of my hiking vacation. It didn't even need charging each day. I took hundreds of pictures and some video clips. The only disapointing pictures were opperator fault. I didn't let the camera finish auto focus and forced the picture, which resulted in a bit blury photo. I also had the bad habbit of having my finger partway over the corner lenz in some photos. Also I took a few video clips with the camera turned sideways and now I can't rotate the movie clips. None of this is the camera's fault. I was amazed at the crisp clarity of the 10 megapixal photos, the ease of using the zoom and face recognition. The presets of landscape and nighttime worked great.  A great value! My camera got damp on the outside a few times taking photos of waterfalls and during rain. It didn't seem to bother it at all. The size and weight make it an ez take along for any occasion. It can take either SD or XD cards. I used a 2GB XD and didn't come close to filling it. Software seems very easy to use, to work with and store your photos.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best. Camera. Ever", "Author": "N.

A few downsides...The viewfinder to take the pictures in the front of the camera in the upper corner is usually where I put my left middle finger so once I found a few pictures taken with my finger in it, I had to remember to keep away.  My girlfriend did the same thing so I know it's not just me.  Also, I was hoping there would be a zoom availible when recording videos, but I don't see this availible.

I liked the design because of the clever way they eliminated the poorly performing lens covers typical of most P&S; digicams like the Canons. Had two of those die after the warranty ran out because of that \"lens error\" problem.One other issue I have with this camera is the position of the lens. It is right where you instinctively grab the camera to hold it when picture taking, consequently, it is VERY easy to put a finger in front of the lens by accident.The Z20 took some great pictures but totally died about one week after purchase. Worked great for handheld closeups of flowers with the \"anti-blur\" feature. At least the Canons worked until the Warranty ran out. The screen took on a weird, mostly black and white streaked effect. Could not view images already taken or view live through the lens. It was not abused or dropped.  Good thing that this was just a pocket camera backup for my Nikon D200. I met someone who had a 10mp Panasonic that looks like a better way to go for a P&S.; I'll be getting a refund for the Z20 and buying a Lumix.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Red Eye Red Eye Red Eye", "Author": "Club Traveler", "ReviewID": "R2WDDZR8ZWD8N7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For all its features, there is no way to adjust the flash, and anyone with an eye color other than jet black becomes the red-eyed monster in every pic.
