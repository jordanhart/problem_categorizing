It's focus is fast enough that the lag mentioned in the reviews I read is unnoticeable in actual use. The f1.8 aperture allows excellent available candid shots. This camera handles mixed lighting better than any I have used giving very good color and skin tones. I have never been a fan of on camera flashes and so was very pleased with the performance of the G16's pop up unit. It did not overpower the ambient light and gave near perfect fill in lighting. The optical viewfinder, which was the primary reason that I wanted a new camera, is acceptable for use on shots that do not require critical framing. The G16 will be a welcome addition to my camera battery, nudging my SX110 aside (the SX will still ride along in the Maxpedition shoulder bag that I carry daily) for inside shots. Neither can or will replace my digital SLR and lens assortment for my \"serious\" imaging.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent Camera", "Author": "P.

I've had several Canon SLR film cameras which I loved and then several Leica and Canon point and shoot cameras but I always preferred my Canon A1 SLR for high quality and flexible shooting until I got the new G16. I've had the G16 for 3 months and taken great shots in snowy Michigan and sunny Florida - landscapes, seascapes, botanical gardens, greenhouses, birds, orchid close-ups and portraits. The image quality has been outstanding for all these venues. I've made several enlargements with outstanding quality. Learning to use all the features took several hours but was not difficult. My first instinct was to shoot in Manual mode, but I've found that Auto does as good or better job 80% of the time. For someone who wants a small unobtrusive camera with both point and shoot and manual control, this is a fine product at a decent price.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new G16 is a great choice for an interested amateur!", "Author": "Gregory J.
