I've owned a Sony Powershot and Canon Exlim in the past. The main problems I've had were blurry shots when I go out with friends to dim restaurants at night, missing shots because of the prolonged lag (esp from the Powershot), and forgetting to put the memory card back in the camera after I downloaded the last batch of pics I took.The T30's Steady Shot works really well. While holding the camera with one hand, I purposely tremored my hand while taking a pic of a still subject; the shot turned out perfect. However, when I take the pic while shaking the camera, the pic still blurs...but really who really shakes their camera when taking a pic?When the camera is set to full automatic point and shoot, the lag time is pretty much unnoticeable. I was at a wedding where the bridal party was walking into the dinner hall....caught every shot and didn't miss the ball because of lag.58MB of internal memory is awesome. I can take 30 really high quality pics when I forget my mem stick...enough to cover an evening out in the city ... but definitely not enough for a vacation trip.These were the main things which made me choose this camera over others. Another plus which is nice is the 3in screen with slideshow feature...my friends were really impressed with this (esp the lady friends hehe).Otherwise, size wise, this camera is not the smallest. The Casio Exlim is definitely smaller and lighter than the T30, but it has features the Exlim is lacking in. But don't get me wrong, this camera is not big at all by any standard, it's only 0.1cm thicker than the Exlim. It still easily fits in my suit breast pocket and is not a hassle to tote around.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "It just keeps getting better and better", "Author": "Moonchilde", "ReviewID": "R3JK5JDRYYCLJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The longer I own and use this camera, the more enthusiastic I become about it - and I was happy with it from day one.  Each use in a different situation proves how brilliant it is.  Good photos in low light situations of all kinds.  Not always\"perfect\", professional-result photos in low light, but certainly good enough to share with others in situations where other digicams can't take pictures at all.  If there is any ambient light around, the pictures will be fine.  The videos are excellent quality, with good sound pickup.  I took vids and photos of jellyfish in a darkened aquarium and most of them came out fine.  Love the slideshow feature and use it all the time.  Am starting to take more and more vids, and loving it.  Perfect for animal photos without flash, thus eliminating \"green eye\", the animal equivalent of red-eye.  The 3\" LCD screen is wonderful, and I have always been able to see my subjects, in bright sunlight or almost no light.  Something new users might not notice or understand - there is a setting for 'vivid' color, a setting for 'normal' color, and one for 'natural' color.  When I first got the camera I had it set on 'normal', but noticed that the photos tended to look a little over-saturated.  Once I set it on 'natural', that disappeared.  It's all a matter of taste, I guess - but very nice to have the choice.Using this camera just makes me want to use it more and more.  I can't say enough good things about it.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Response to \"sunshine lover\"", "Author": "H. Huang", "ReviewID": "RHQIWMH74TD12", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon needs a commenting feature for reviews so that we don't need to actually submit a whole review to make a comment about another review.Anyhow, just wanted to say that the reason why \"sunshine lover\" has had problems with a dark face is not the fault of the camera nor because of color balancing.  EVERY camera will do this when using matrix or scene average type auto exposure.  The problem is that a camera does not have the dynamic range to capture details in BOTH a dimly lit object (face in shadows) AND a bright background.  So it has to choose one of them to properly expose.  Since the overall scene is bright, it sets the exposure (aperture and shutter speed) as such.  Even if you \"spot\" expose or use exposure compensation, to properly expose the face, the background would then be overexposed and show up as bright white.The only way to really \"solve\" this problem is to either set up the shot so that the face gets more light, or turn on the flash so that the face is bright enough to match the exposure of the bright background scene.  Use the flash - it's a very common technique for getting proper exposure of shaded faces.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "RAW noise reduction", "Author": "Radio", "ReviewID": "R3IG67R3M16N2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great camera, the image stablilzer isnt so much better then other models from other companies. BUT, the RAW(an algorithum applied at the code itself, as opposed to after interpolation of the image)image noise reducer really works well. I can't say enough about that feature. I mean at iso 1k, there's still a \"little bit\" of noise, but it's not nearly as bad(most people wont notice it, certainly not the common user) as some of the older cameras that just fully blurred out. DO get the lcd protector/cover(they sell them here at amazon, i dont know what brand), otherwise the lcd will get scratched from just being in pocket with keys.edit 10/10/06:taken lots of photos with it, and I need to clarify that there is noise in the higher iso settings, just less then other camers. You also have to zoom in on high def photos to really notice it. Also, the camera costs much less elsewhere, usually fifty dollars less then here.

Very pleased with quick shipping - next day - right on time. The camera is really sharp and easy to use, screen is awesome, size is perfect. I was disappointed that there seems to be no time/date stamp option - my previous Sony digital camera had this to turn on or off. I liked this for taking garden pictures so I could easily print and see progress by date, but the DSCT30 doesn't have this. None of the review sites mentioned whether it had or didn't have this so I rolled the dice that it would. Also, so far I'm underimpressed with the whole anti-shake feature. I have a 2 month old, and even her little head movements while laying on a blanket causes some blur. But there are a ton of mode options, way more than my previous Sony, that I'm just getting into figuring out. Seems like a really solid little unit that I'm sure will be in my pocket for the next couple years.

At first we thought that the lens and/or flash may be dirty so we cleaned and then realized that the spots were still appearing and in different areas in many different photos.  This seems to happen more often when we are using the red eye reduction flash. After reading the manual it states that this is the result of reflecting dust in the air and is unavoidable.  I find this very hard to believe as my Kodak and Canon have never had this issue and all dust particles will never be entirely eliminated!  The pictures are not salvageable unless you have great skill with Photo Shop.  Any suggestions as to why this may be happening are greatly appreciated.

However my major gripe and the reason I am going to sell this and buy a different digital camera is its shutter lag.  It takes so long from pressing the button to take the picture to actually taking the picture (with auto flash). I primarily use it to take photos of my small children and I am constantly missing those 'adorable' moments.  Group photos are difficult too as the first flash seems to indicate to the group that the photo has been taken and they move before the second flash has occurred - thus messing up the photo.

Mine is , ehh compared to this one. I bought the DSC-T30 for my boyfriend for his birthday gift. It is so much nicer than mine is. However, there are things I was upset about that mine had and this oen did not. I thought it was a little upsetting because I think some features should have been left how they were, because they were so nice! For example, my camera has a case that is great. For such a small camera you want it to be kept as safe as it can be. My case you can actually open the case (while the camera is still inside) and then take the picture. This camera, the DSC-T30 does not have that kind of accessory. Dont get me wrong it has a very beautiful leather case you can buy for your belt, but I think I prefer the case that opens better. Also, the DSC-T1 has a dock that you can rest the camera on so you dont have to take the battery out to charge it. With this camera, you have to take the battery out to charge it in this little charger case thing. Now, maybe they do have a charger dock that I just dont know about, if they did, that would be amazing !Now, on to the picture quality. Man this thing beats my camera so bad ! The DSC-T30 has AMAZING picture quality. It not only has a macto lense, it now features a magnifying glass ! The quality on this thing kills. I mean, mine has a great macro feature, but this one blows mine away ! The color is so vibrant. It also has a cute little slideshow you can hook up to your tv and it plays music ! I wish it was more like canon though. Canon digital camera flip the pictures right side up. For example if you want to take a picture of a person, full length (verticle) the camera would flip it within the view finder so you didnt have to rotate the camera. Well, sony doesnt do that. Also, what is great about this little camera is that it uses the Lithium Ion batteries. Those are the best batteries to have because they can recharge and they have such a long life span. You can use two 1 gb memory cards and the camera battery still wont die.All in all this is a great little camera to have. Takes great pictures and fits in the back of your jeans right in the pocket !

I loved that camera, and the many fine pictures I took with it. When it got stolen, I was determined to replace it with something better, but still a great camera.My reservations with the Mavica were mainly its size, and that it took usually a half an hour to download photos off of each disc. That's a lot of camera (and a lot of time spent hovering over a 12\" G4 laptop), and its portability left a little to be desired, so when I looked for a replacement, I wanted one that was smaller, but still a Sony. I figured for an extra few bucks, I'd get more megapixels this time out.I didn't know all that much about the DSC-T30, but I liked the way it looked, and it got solidly good product reviews.I am no expert...I just like taking pictures. I love this camera. It's small, powerful, and sturdy. I've dropped it, and it's been fine.
