{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT SELLER, GREAT PRODUCT, but with one critical issue.", "Author": "Bryan V. Deguzman \"lmaonade\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZJ1FRRYRI8TE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The package shown here is the Gopro Hero3+ Silver edition WITH a 32gb card.I guess the card that they give you is unclear, but I got a Kingston 32gb micro class 10 with this combo package deal. I have extensively read throughout gopro forums about people complaining about freezing up and having recording times automatically stop between 10 seconds and 30 minutes. Long story short, there were A LOT of issues and I started to become disheartened. I took the risk of buying a new 32gb SANDISK EXTREME UHS-1 class 10 micro and there were no more issues. If you even think on settling on a 32gb SANDISK ULTRA, you will have issues as everyone else posted. It all depends on the writing speed of the card, and the extreme really made a difference. I hope this helps people, but the new HERO3+ works well. Just get the micro sd card, format it on the computer and format it in the camera and you should have no issues.I hope this really helps. And I repeat, the 32gb they're packaging with this gopro will give you issues. You need a faster card.
