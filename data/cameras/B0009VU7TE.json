I recently purchased the Kodak P850 and have been very pleased with the camera - it's really cute too.  The camera takes excellent pictures and is a steal at $499.  I've had numerous compact cameras (including Kodak) but they all seem to deliver the same picture quality .. great pictures under ideal conditions - but when the conditions are not perfect, Compact digital camera shots are unacceptable.  This camera is just the right size and is easy to handle.  The 12X zoom makes it difficult to ever pick up a 3X camera again !!  The camera has little if no shutter lag making that impossible shot easy to take.  It is one of the very few camera's on the market that allows you to zoom during video - this is a very desirable feature.  The Auto setting \"glams\" all pictures, making them look their best.  But sometimes you don't want to \"glam\" your pictures .. candlelight conditions, etc - that's when you use one of the many \"scene\" modes.  You tell the camera your present \"scene\" and it takes the picture without over dramatizing it (like the previous Kodak's did).  The 2.5\" LCD screen is also the perfect size - the indoor/outdoor display enables you to view pictures under all lighting conditions.  The battery life is also generous, I've been playing with it for 2 weeks and still have not had to charge the batteries.  Oh and the best thing about this camera is something called \"Image Stabilization\", this basically means no more blurry pictures - even at High Zoom !!  If you buy this camera - you won't regret it.  In the future the Digital Camera's and Camcorder will merge and become one - this Camera may have achieved that since it takes excellent video.PROS:* High Optical Zoom - 12X* High Quality Lens* 2.5\" LCD Display* Zoom during Video* Image Stabilization Technology - no blurry pictures* No shutter lag.CONS:* Zoom Motor Noise heard during Video playback* Camera comes with no caseOveral Rating:  5 STARSRECOMMENDED BUY:  YES", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Kodak does it again...!!", "Author": "R. Ozer \"Family of 4 Purchaser\"", "ReviewID": "R1MQLX9GDVRAUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So glad this was finally hit the market.  I've been a loyal Kodak customer since digital cameras hit the market.  I've owned the DC280 and then upgraded to the DX6490 and have been very satisfied.  So, with its 10X and other great features, you'd wonder why someone would look to migrate from the DX6490 to the P850.  My gripe with the DX6490 is that it is difficult to get clean pictures when using the maximum zoom due to camera shake AND I really want a camera that takes great video...320 x 240 pixels at 20 fps is adequate but not great.  Well, the P850 does it all.  With image stabilization, camera shake is not an issue...and the video quality is surperb...the 30 fps at 640 x 480 in a compressed format is terrific.  And you can also use the zoom during movie mode which is a huge improvement.I've had the DC280, the DX6490 and now this camera...what I appreciate most is that Kodak has maintained its outstanding menu user interface across all models.  As I've migrated up, the learning curve has been minimal and I was able to use the camera's advanced features immediately.My only disappointment with Kodak is that it purchased Ofoto instead of Shutterfly...Shutterfly is a far superior platform and I would have preferred the EasyShare integration with that platform instead of the other.  Oh well...that's what Adobe Photoshop is for!  Enjoy.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "I Like This Camera!!!!", "Author": "S. Reddick \"sredd68\"", "ReviewID": "R18JLYOTY8JU4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say that the Kodak P850 is not an upgrade to the Z/DX7590 in my opinion. It is in a different product line. So please don't compare one to another. The P850 is a camera made for enthusiasts that like to have control from set-up to shutter press to PP (post-processing). This camera is better in its P,A,S,M & C modes than Auto and Scene modes. That being said here are my lists of positives and negatives:Positves:  Image Stabilization, RAW and Tiff modes, Manual Focus, Improved Flash w/ increased range, 12x optical zoom, Slightly wider angle than the DX/Z7590, Customizable White Balance, Multiple ISO ranges from 50 to 800, more detail (bigger jpeg files=less compression), Hot flash shoeNegatives:  Tends to over-expose in AUTO mode, hunts in focus in Macro mode, certain scene and low-light conditions, somewhat slow write for RAW and Tiff files, No burst mode for RAW and Tiff modes, different jog wheel operation, No exposure compensation in Auto and Scene modes, ISO 800 only available in 1.2 megapixel setting, no manual flash release lever.Most of the negatives can be corrected with a firmware upgrade that is being worked on now, according to a Kodak representative in an email reply, and should be released shortly.Now that's out of the way...the picture quality is great, the camera feels good in my hands, it takes all of the accessories made for the DX/Z7590 and the ability to add an external flash that syncs with the camera settings. I would recommend this camera to anyone that likes to work the camera, instead of letting the camera do all the work. If you already own a DX/Z7590 you really don't need this camera unless you want the hot shoe, IS, RAW and Tiff modes, better overall low-light and the PictBridge capabilities. IF you do, then this is the camera for you. You can find this camera cheaper than just about any of the other Ultra Zooms.***EDIT*** Kodak has recently released a firmware upgrade for this camera that decreases shutter lag, improves the auto focus and exposure and adds a pixel remapping program to remove any malfunctioning pixels on the sensor. I upgraded mine and I highly recommend anyone that owns this camera to do the same. It makes a world of difference in its operation.", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice features with some limitations", "Author": "Ken Broomfield", "ReviewID": "R34IQ9HGK3MSI6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I carefully compared the Kodak P850 to the Canon S2 IS and the Kodak has a few clear advantages in addition to a slightly lower price:-- Much larger, higher resolution LCD screen-- RAW (uncompressed) image format, though this is not available in continuous/bracketing modes-- Histogram display while shooting, which the Canon only provides in playback mode-- Time-lapse mode (which I personally find very useful)The Kodak has a few limitations:-- Its continuous mode frame rate is slower than the Canon's (and even slower than my old Canon A70)-- Its closest macro focusing distance is about four inches. The Canon S2's \"super macro\" mode can focus right to the front of the lens, letting you get as close as you want if lighting permits.-- It uses a proprietary lithium battery instead of AA's, so you have to carry another charger when traveling and spares are harder to find.-- It lacks the Canon's focus bracketing mode-- It has a less solid, less elegant physical feel than the Canon, though it's not bad.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice Super Zoom Camera", "Author": "Donald W.

As a consumer of electronics, myself, I enjoy hearing the \"nuts and bolts\" reviews from honest consumers who want to make sure they are making a sound purchase.If I could stand on my computer chair and scream, \"You'll LOVE this Kodak Easyshare P850\", I would do it for you. I have had digital cameras since the very beginning, even long before people could even entertain the idea of a 1 Megapixel Digital Camera. Kodak has come through, once again, with another EASYSHARE Camera with 5 Megapixels and a 12x Stabilized Zoom.I have a friend who likes to tell me that I paid too much for this camera. He likes to remind me that he can find a 5MP Digital Camera on a popular auction site and the cost is less than half of the well-priced Kodak Easyshare P850. What I have to tell him is that \"You Get What You Pay For\" when you purchase a higher-end digital camera. He doesn't realize, until I spend time explaining this to him, that the cameras he has shown me might advertise that they have 5 Megapixels but that is ONLY when the enclosed software interpolates the digital information. With the Kodak Digital Camera you are getting every bit of what you have paid for and every megapixel that is offered in this fine and intelligent camera.You will find the camera to be a friendly one, many of the menus are so easy to navigate through-you'll feel like an engineer as you manipulate the many features with total ease. I've literally owned more than 10 digital cameras and as a film photographer I have spent the past few years comparing the quality of the digital cameras I had. The software, even ALONE, is worth as much as the amount you'll pay for this great camera. Taking photographs is simple, transferring them to your computer is done with absolute ease, and making changes (reducing red-eye, adding more brightness, etc) on your computer is easier than I have ever experienced.I hope this review has been somewhat helpful to you. Please spend time in reviewing the many, many features that I have not touched on. There are sites, [...] that allow consumers to compare honest reviews (and competitive prices too) on incredible digital cameras like this one.Don't feel that if you spend the hard earned money on this camera, that technology will soon make your camera seem like a dinosaur. Technology is always changing, however the Kodak Easyshare P850 5MP Digital Camera will compete with the best of the best for many years to come. Enjoy this intelligent, durable and uncomplicated digital camera.Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my opinion on this camera. I always worry that people, like my Mom, might get suckered into buying a camera that isn't as advertised. I would not hesitate to pursuade my Mom to buy this attractive and totally functional digital camera.Sincerely,Peter CannicePhoenix, ArizonaFeel free to email me if I have left something out or if you need anything at all.

I was a little nervous since it hasn't been out for very long and there aren't many professional reviews on it yet, but it had all of the features I was looking for and the initial user reviews looked good.  As far as my photography history goes, I like to take pictures, but have only ever had basic point and shoot cameras.  This will be my first camera which I can exercise manual control over the aperture, shutter speed, etc.I've had the camera for a few days now and have had the chance to play around with it.  I went to the museum first, and found that it took excellent pictures considering the low-light situation.  I was disappointed in the limits of the image stabilization feature, but I understand that there's only so much it can do when there's low light and consequently slow shutter speeds.  I'd say that I probably got 1 out of 5 long-zoomed shots to be clear in the museum.  Outside at the park was a different story.  Even at full zoom, all of the shots were crystal clear.Since I don't know much about aperture, shutter speed, white balance, etc, yet, all the shots I took this weekend were using the various 'Scene' settings (macro, flower, museum, landscape, etc).  I was impressed with how well the pictures came out - the improvement over the pictures I used to take with my previous digital camera is amazing!  I plan on learning more about the other capabilities of this camera, but even without using the more advanced settings, it still produced great photos!Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I'm looking forward to testing out all of the various features!", "Date": "November 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price.....does so much", "Author": "Mitchell Gobetz", "ReviewID": "R1P5FWE6D5B546", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is absolutely phenomenal.

Image stabilization (reduces your chances of blurred images) which is especially important with longer zoom.2. 12x optical zoom, great for portraiture.3. capability of using accessory filters and lenses with use of an adapter available from Kodak.4. You can Select between using the LCD or the optical viewfinder. Turning the LCD off saves battery power. (Most pocket digital cameras do not even provide an optical viewfinder.) The image you see through the viewfinder or on the LCD does not suffer from parallax. Just like with an SLR camera, what you see in the viewfinder will be the actual photo image.5. Large size (2.5\") LCD screen. I am not getting any younger and the tiny screens are difficult to work with.6. Top quality lens combined with 5 MP produces pictures of high definition and fine resolution. There are TIFF and raw format options, which I am not familiar with but hope to learn about.I've just worked with this camera for a few sessions but am impressed with the user-friendly controls. Flash can be turned off if desired. With use of the software, your pictures go to Kodakgallery.com, where you can share albums via email. There are some fun special effects and editing that you can do through the Kodak Gallery, I'm hoping they will add more such as soft edged framing and maybe some paintshop-type options. If you don't like to use preflash for redeye reduction, you can edit out the redeye in Kodak gallery.I could find no case or cover made for this camera. Kodak should include a form-fitting camera cover from which the straps extend, allowing the camera to stay around your neck or in your bag and remain protected. The Kodak case that I bought requires turning the camera sideways to fit it into the case, and there is no accomodation for the straps. I hope someone at the company is reading these reviews!!! This camera deserves a great case. Also it would have been nice to be able to screw on filters directly without needing an adapter.This is not a pocket camera, but is comfortable to hold in the palm of your hand and very portable. I plan to add a wide-angle lens, a UV filter and a polarizing filter.

Farrell", "ReviewID": "R14LKH7EOHV74M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my P850 as a Christmas gift from my husband in 2005, who took my Canon Ixus 40 (4 MP) camera with him to Iraq (and I was reluctant to give it up...that is a GREAT little point and shoot camera!!!)  I started out in the digital world with a Nikon 950 (2 MP) and I used that one for years and years...it finally got sand in the swivel mechanisism and has never been the same since  :( I decided that this is the camera I wanted because I didn't know if I would use an SLR because I was still an ameteur.  I research many cameras, if not daily, close to it.  I still can't seem to find a better camera.  The thing I liked about this camera was that it had plenty of mode scenes to choose from because I was still pretty intimdated by the Priorty, Aperature and shutter sequences.  Well, I'm not any more...esp since I've had this camera.  I can adjust just about anything to suit the lighting and I rarely, if ever use the flash anymore! The menu features are easily assesible and intuitive to use as well ( A good feature to have!) As a matter of fact, I've looked into a full-blown SLR cameras and can't seem to find one that really compares to this!  The fact that this camera can be upgraded with an external flash and wide-angle and telescopic lenses makes this a nice fit.My husband and I travel a lot, esp since he is in the military.  This camera was affordable which is more than I can say about most of the digital SLRs.  5 MP is more than enough for your average Joe, printing out 4x6 prints, and it does so, quite nicely.  It does make pretty 5x7s, and I haven't yet decided on the perfect 8x10 yet...just to see how it looks.  Most people aren't making those kinds of prints and having a 10 MP camera doesn't really matter unless you are taking pictures of the bug's warts on the tree on the mountain 2 miles in front of you, which is the only reason I didn't decide to go with the P880.  They are basically the same camera, with less scene modes and more MP.The battery life is great on this camera, too.  I took it with me to Hawaii on vacation and I charged the battery 3 times in 14 days.  I used the camera every day, showed my pictures off, reviewed them several times and left the dang thing on in my bag on the flight by mistake.  I still have full charge on the battery after nearly 10 days of not using it.  This camera has taken some quite nice pictures and it sure beats having a digital point and shoot.  I can actually look into the eye piece as if I am using an actual film camera.  I love that it has an anti-shake in the camera as well, since I love to use the macro functions to make pictures of bugs and plants and that just wouldn't be possible to do unless you had a tripod...but that's impractical if you are pressed for time when you are with a tour group.  I'll bet I can make better pictures of lightenin' bugs with this camera than my aunt did using a tripod with her old film SLR (but alas, there are no lightenin' bugs in Germany that I have seen :(I never give 5 stars to products because there will always be something else that is better.  I simply can not in good conscience give this camera 5 stars!  There are some limitations to this camera.  The recycle time on the camera tends to be slow and when using the movie feature the recycle time is nearly triple!  If you have patience, then you're a better person than I am!! HAHA, it was more of an annoyance than anything, but you will get over it.  I  found that setting the review mode off while taking pictures does make the camera recycle a bit faster and that is permanently off on my camera at the moment.  I have used a friend's Canon Digital Rebel camera and the recycle time is much faster (I actually considered trading my Kodak because of that very reason!)  I don't know about you, but I would rather not miss that one perfect shot because the camera is too slow!!!  There are features on the Kodak that Canon just doesn't offer and it is a bit more complicated to learn than this was.No matter what kind of camera you decide to get, I seriously recommend that you go to a brick and mortar store and take a few test shots and feel the camera in your hand.  I don't recommend buying one in the store though, you're probably going to end up paying way too much for it.  You should definately have a few cameras in mind before you go.  Don't let the salesperson intimidate you.  This is a huge purchase and one you're likely to be stuck with it for a few years.  Definately check other websites to see other reviews, too.Ok, I'll step off my soapbox now...IN SUMMARY: pretty good camera, anti-shake, macro modes, zoom feature, scene features, 5 MP, upgradable lenses and external flash, exceptional battery life, slow recycle times, research before buyingRECOMMEND:  Yes, especially if you want to upgrade to a full-blown digital SLR sometime later in the future.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "homerun for Kodak", "Author": "Samuel Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R187YG14DSM8C5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak is the number one seller of digital cameras for a good reason-they make great cameras.

Bottom line -- this camera is much more fun to use.  The LCD, while not having the highest resolution, is much better than Canon's 2.0 rotating LCD.  I compare this to the Canon because I used to have the Canon, and that camera is also the standard for comparison.I like the rechargeable battery.  I have the camera dock, and it's great to just put the camera on it and not worry at all about the battery or charging rechargeables.  I bought two extra batteries because Kodak prices them reasonably.The Image Stabilization works great on this camera -- better than the Canon.  It takes longer to focus, however.  The Canon is quick to focus and much more responsive.  For my needs though, it's not an overriding factor.I like to take a lot of pictures without the flash.  However, whenever I turn off the flash, and turn off the camera, the flash is set back to auto.  This is very frustrating.  Maybe I need to research the custom settings and see if that can be of help.I am very disappointed in the movie mode.  It takes good movies, but it doesn't use MPEG 4 compression, like other Kodaks.  It was probably a matter of timing.  I think I read that the successor to this camera will use MPEG 4.  I bought a Kodak 530 at Office Depot on sale for $139 several weeks ago that uses MPEG 4 with image stabilization, and it blows away the P850.3 Stars from me for ultra-zoom cameras is pretty good.  I gave the Canon 1 star for resting on its laurels.  I think much better ultra-zooms are going to crop up in the next year or so.  Kodak's next model looks good, the Sony H5 looks fantastic, and the Canon S4 will have to be a major refinement.In the meantime, I will enjoy the P850.

Add to this the optional easyshare printer you can get through amazon and there is no competition.  The printer puts a clear coat on each print that prevents color fading and smudging--a problem with some ink-jets.  No computer is needed, but if hooked to one, e-mail can be sent at the touch of a button.  And it even recharges the camera!  the Kodak easyshare system is tops!**I did notice Luis' comments below on the camera.  Luis seems to have really negative views, often using foul language and expletives to attack products.  He has since re-posted a version of his review and attacks me and another poster, who noted his exteme comments.  Anyhow, I hope the average reader gets the picture about his reviews in general.  Hey, Luis!  Whatever you buy next, I sure hope that it does not \"suck!!!\"", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Worthless", "Author": "Robert G.

First the software that came with this piece of junk did not want to install correctly. Second the camera would not shut off after shutting it down, it would just remain on with the lens retracted. Third the pictures this thing produces are just horrible. Now I can't even return it back to the store because my 30 days have expired. I will now have to try and sell this piece of junk on eBay for less money and hope somebody buys this thing \"as is\". I must say to the guys who gave this piece of crap a negative review here, that I wish I saw your help-full reviews before I went and bought this camera.
