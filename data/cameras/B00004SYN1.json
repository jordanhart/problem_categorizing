{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good things come in small packages", "Author": "\"wcharlief\"", "ReviewID": "R5L92IN3ROJAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the other Amazon reviews, I felt compelled to write my own.First off, I'll get the only bad thing about this camera out of the way.  You MUST buy the optional power supply kit, otherwise you will be spending an extra 20 bucks for a Lithium CR5 battery every couple of weeks.  The power supply kit, from what I have seen, goes for about 60-80 bucks, and includes the rechargable battery, charger, and A/C adapter (for operating without a battery when plugged into the wall, which comes in very handy).Without buying this kit, the camera does come with the required lithium battery, serial cable for PC, serial cable for Mac, USB for PC/Mac, video cable, and an 8MB compact flash memory card.  (Wrist strap, CD-rom, manuals and camera also included, obviously)  First of all, the 8MB memory card can hold a lot more than 12 pictures, as quoted by one of the reviewers.  If you read the manual, you'll find that the S10 can take pictures in 3 different resolutions, as well as 3 different compression ratios.  In other words, 1600x1200 is a huge picture, and most normal people find 800x600 (the smallest setting) to be plenty sufficient for taking everyday pictures.  Most people's computer resolutions are set to 800x600, and a picture that size would fill up the whole screen, if that gives you any idea.  If you set the camera to 800x600 and high compression, you can put 61 pictures on the 8MB card.  These are only a couple of the good customization options I found by reading the manual.  This camera also 4x digital zoom and 2x regular zoom, which was not clarified by another reviewer.  This feature can be enabled if you turn it on in the camera settings.  It's not enabled by default.Besides the zoom and large amount of picture storage, this camera can do a ton of stuff that I couldn't do on my old Fujifilm camera.  Aside from the resolution and compression options, and the 4x digital zoom, the S10 can be set to manual mode and adjusted for specific situations.  You can adjust the white balance, exposure level, object focus, and lighting condition options.  If you don't feel like fooling with all these individually, there's an \"Image\" mode which allows you to set the camera for specific conditions, like Landscape, Fast shutter, Slow shutter, Night scene, and Black and white.  And even further than this, there's a regular picture-taking mode for amateurs that allows you to just point and click while the camera automatically adjusts to the best settings.  To top it all off, there's an included slide show option that cycles through all the pictures or a specific line-up that you make, which when hooked up to the TV (via the video cable) can make for great, quick entertainment, without having to download all the pictures and show them to someone on a computer.  And for the outdoor photographer, there's an included photo-stitching mode that allows you to take several pictures, vertically or horizontally, and stitch them together seamlessly with the included software.  (I.e. taking 3 pictures of a long beach and pasting them together)In summary, after reading the manual included with the S10, I found that nearly everything is included into this durable, pocket-size camera.  I'm extremely glad that I bought it, and it far outperforms my Fujifilm camera in picture quality, useablity, and transfer speeds. (with the USB cable).  Even the LCD display is much brighter and clearer!  Plus it looks cool!  It's hard to go wrong if buying this camera.  You won't be let down.", "Date": "October 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "Convenient and high quality", "Author": "Russell Belfer", "ReviewID": "R5MT7SAMT0QP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The S10 is a fine little camera.  In automatic mode, it quickly snaps 1600x1200 shots with medium level compression.  You can fit about a dozen on the 8MB CompactFlash card that comes with the camera; I get around 55+  on my 32MB card.  These shots are fairly high quality; in good lighting  conditions, I can print them as 4x6 photos and they look at least as good  as my cheapy 35mm camera.You can put the camera in manual mode for  greater control over compression, image size, gain, digital zoom, etc.  This can be useful, but this camera is not targeted towards the person who  wants elaborate details control.  It does contain some easy-to-use  sophisticated features: the panorama stitch mode is extremely easy, and the  black-and-white and other \"special effects\" shot types are also  just a twist of the dial away.What are the weak points?  Well, for one,  it's pretty appalling that the camera doesn't ship with the Canon  rechargable battery.  You will need to purchase that and a recharger right  away (at an additional cost of around $100).  Also, although it isn't  horrible, I would prefer a 3x optical zoom.  2x just doesn't do that much.  Number three, the optical viewfinder doesn't align very tightly with the  actual shot -- you can use the LCD display, but that drains the batteries.  Finally, I was disappointed that there is so little tactile feedback when  you snap a picture.  I'm wary about having a stranger take my photo with  this camera because I fear they won't realize when they've taken the  shot!I've found that having a digital camera fundamentally changes they  way I take photographs.  I'm much more likely to snap 3 or 4 shots of a  particular view and then immediately scan over them and pick the best 1 (or  2) and discard the others.  This was a lot of fun and I think it improved  the overall quality of photos that I take.  (Of course, I could just try to  become a better photographer...)  The Canon S10 is easy to use and carry  around, and I'm happy that I purchased it.", "Date": "May 15, 2000"}, {"Title": "Amazing value...", "Author": "Andre Stechert", "ReviewID": "RLN2FYPP2A8ZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought one of these S10's.  As a 2 megapixel camera (where thegeneral classes are 1, 2, and 3 megapixels..., respectively at the time of this writing), I've been very happy with my purchase.  My main reasons for choosing this camera were:1. It has a USB connection. Very important for speedy downloads.  Do NOT get a 2mp or greater camera without one.  Warning: Win98/Win2000 are your best bets - NT doesn't support USB and neither does win95.2. It supports CompactFlash Type II.  I like CF better than SmartMedia.  It's cheaper, supports higher capacity cards, and is more durable.3. It supports the IBM MicroDrive 340 CF type II card (which would be a reason to buy this camera over the new digital ELPH S100, which is too small for that drive).  340MB = about 500 pictures for about $300. How huge is that!4. My lower bound was 2 megapixels.  The 3 Meg cameras JUST came out, so the prices on these two megapixel cameras all dropped by about 50% a few months ago.  3 megapixel cameras are still pretty pricey...5. The review on dpreview was very good. Phil Askey explains in great depth the pluses and minuses of these cameras.  I value his opinion a lot and he highly recommended this camera.6. Battery life is reputed to be about 50 shots with regular use of the LCD preview and scanning shots.  That seems about right in my usage so far.7. Extremely compact and rugged, fits in your pants pocket.  Has a sturdy non-plastic tripod mount.Biggest surprises after buying the camera:1. The software that came with the camera is surprisingly good.  Thumbs up.2. The batteries that you use are about $12 a pop, unless you get the rechargeables.  The recharging device is a little under $100 and comes with one battery.  Everyone recommends this as the first accessory followed by purchase of two more rechargeables (for a total of three) at about $35/ea.  With this setup, you can take about 150 pictures - teamed with a 340Mb MicroDrive you can fit the entire vacation on the camera with room to spare!3. I'd like to find a nice protective case for it, but they don't seem to be available :(.4. You can't do the flash upgrade of the camera's firmware without the recharger kit.  Fair warning!5. The 340MB drive had some minor incompatibilities with the camera until the software patch released the first week of May 2000.6. The LCD panel has the best anti-glare of any digital camera I've ever used.  Big FAT SORT.Hope this helps!", "Date": "May 31, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good form factor, sharp pictures, mediocre color capture", "Author": "hyperbolium", "ReviewID": "R389VK8JJLFIZZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The S10 packs a lot of features into a compact form. As a tote-around point-and-shoot, it's a good choice. The retracting lens and automatic cover make it easy to pack, and the ability to take high capacity memory  cards or IBM disk devices allow you to take quite a few pictures (even at  2-megapixel resolution) without downloading.On the downside, the S10  consumes battery power at a higher rate than other digital cameras I've  used, and the specialized batteries are expensive. The rechargeable battery  pack from Canon is helpful, but it's not included with the camera, upping  the cost of a useable configuration.The 2x optical zoom is a bit short,  given that many of the competitors products give you 3x. I often find that  missing magnification requires me to shoot at a higher resultion and crop  the result.Most disappointing is the S10's inabilities to accurately  capture colors in the red-orange range. Flesh tones are often rendered  incorrectly, and flash pictures often end up leaving skin looking pasty. No  amount of adjusting the cameras controls seems to solve the problem.  I've  read reports by others who've suffer the same results, so I'm inclined to  think it's a software problem, rather than an issue with my individual  unit.In addition to the rechargeable battery pack, I'd recommend using  this with a computer that has a USB port (and getting a USB card if your  machine doesn't have one!), as downloading pix, expecially high-resolution  shots, through the serial port is painfully slow.", "Date": "July 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "High quality for an inexpensive price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3PRHKM5HIVI2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Canon S10 digital camera and so far it has beenworking great!S10 comes in a 8MB CompactFlash card which can hold up to 12 large pictures (1600 x 1200) and it is compatible with the 340MB card and connects to your computer using a USB port; if you have a Window95 or Windows NT system, don't worry, it also comes with a serial cable though using it would really slow down the actual download speed. S10 is also very compact compared with many other digital cameras, which is an excent choice if you have limited space on vacations. The feature I like most about this digi cam is that it has its own slide show built-in which you can hook up to your television with another cable that is provided in the package. Plus some other feature including Black and White photographs, slow motion, red eye reduction, etc.Here are some of my regrets: 1. The software that is provided with the digi cam is very poorly put together and crashes alot on my Toshiba notebook.2. The CompactFlash that is provided is TOO limited I would buy the 340MB card or buy a couple more of those 8MB cards.3.  S10 uses to much power, you will need to buy the recharger for around $100 because the Canon is so desperite to get more money, or you need to buy a dozen of those batteries at $12 each3. 2x zoom is just not enough, you need at least 5x or greater...", "Date": "June 8, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Nick Amaral", "ReviewID": "ROZUGKDMQPSJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are serious about buying this product I am sure that you already  know all the specs on it and such so I will just tell you why I bought it  and what I use it for.The reason I chose the Canon S10 over other  similar digital cameras was mainly the size of the camera.  I can easily  fit this camera in my pocket on my way to the great outdoors.While I  am outdoors this camera is very sturdy.  When powered down the lens  retracts and is enclosed away from any harm.Now this is how I use my  camera, usually I take my pictures at the highest quality and when my 48mb  cf card fills up I go through my pictures on the viewfinder and delete the  ones that I don't like so much, and I fire away with my memory free'd up.Back at my computer I upload with the USB connection (must have,  anything else is WAY to slow).  The photo company I print with is  ofoto.com, they are great!  They have software where you can crop your  photos for the desired size, this is great when you take a picture with  something that you didn't originally want in the photo.

Amazon got the camera to me the day before I left - needless to say, I was reading the  manual and taking test photos on the plane to Anchorage!  I found the S10  to be very easy to use, and very difficult to take bad pictures with.  I'm  still discovering new features.  One of my favorites is the ability to  connect the camera to any television set and show your pictures within  seconds of taking them.  We did this several times on the ship.  The  compact size of the S10 makes it more likely that I will carry it with me  on outings, rather than leave it at home.  I've not yet gotten into the  computer/software side of digital photography, but I'll attack that soon -  I just got back from Alaska yesterday.  Three recommendations:  1) you MUST  get the rechargeable battery set, and probably an extra rechargeable  battery.  It's unfortunate that the charger outfit was not included with  the camera (and included in the price).  For this reason, if I had it to do  over again, I would look very closely at the Canon S100.  2)  You should  consider getting a larger capacity compact flashcard - I got a 32Meg, which  holds about 140 snapshot-type pictures. 3)Think about getting a soft case  for the camera - Canon makes a leather case - you can also get nylon cases  that work.  I worry about scratching or otherwise damaging the LCD screen  while carrying the camera unprotected.", "Date": "June 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "This was a great purchase", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3MP9UC1HGY6XS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really have enjoyed the performance and ease of use of this camera.  Its small size makes it very easy to have available when it's needed.  Sure the S100 is smaller, but it sacrfices a few features such as an auxilliary status screen (saves batteries).  Canon really should include the power supply/recharger as the camera is not practicle without it.  There is one feature that I should point out (haven't noticed it in other reviews here): The S10 is compatible with the IBM Microdrive (as certified by both Canon and IBM).  This Microdrive replaces the meager 8MB flash memory card that comes with the camera.  It is 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of the equivalent number of flash memory cards.  Just plug in the 340MB or 1GB version and watch the picture capacity counter go through the roof.  With a 340MB Microdrive, I can take over 280 pictures of the highest resolution and least compression.  I could get over 3000 pictures at lower resolutions and quality, but why settle for sub-optimal images?  Monitors and other displays are going to improve and get bigger in the years to come (think wall-sized monitors).  Image resolution will become more apparent.  I'm planning on my digital images lasting longer than me or my children.

The class of camera has some limitations (only 2x optical zoom), but compared to other cameras in the same price catagory, I rate it at the top. You may also want to consider the Nikon CoolPix 800 which is neck and neck  (although no USB).Some good aspects:1. The image quality is  excellent. See ... a review which rates this as equal to  or better than Nikon digital cameras (even the more expensive ones). Also,  see the image quality for yourself at the online gallery.2. The camera  is very compact and the lens automatically retracts and covers itself (!)  when not in use.3. Autofocus is very good and the camera has a red light  which allows it to focus in the dark. Trying to focus with digital cameras  using a range finder or LCD is difficult if you haven't tried it, so this  is important. I didn't realize this as I am  used to 35mm SLR cameras.  There is also a focus lock which allows some override.4. Red eye  reduction feature, a macro mode and rapid shooting feature.5. Camera  case is metal! Doesn't seem to scratch easily as metal has a mat finish  with some kind of 'kryptonite' coating. This kind of attention to quality  is something that supposedly isn't around any more in consumer products.  Congratulations Canon on refusing to compromise on this (I'm not a 'things  ain't what they used to be' person).Not so good:1. Canon rechargable  kit neccesary - a must buy so figure into the total cost. This kit  apparently comes with the camera outside the U.S.2. Connector for  downloading to the computer has a release button to remove the connector  which hurts my thumb/is difficult to remove. This is not an issue if you  take the CompactFlash memory out and use a cardreader to download your  photos (My particular connector may just be defective).Overall, very  happy with this purchase.

At it's current price point it is a bargain.  The s20 may even be worth the extra for the higher resolution depending on your needs. Also the software is easy to use and the photo stitch program for panarama shots works very well.  I wish there was an affordable second battery available.

Turn the LCD screen off except when framing shots.  This will allow the  battery to last a long time.  2. Make sure that you have the most recent  operating system for the camera.  It should be v.1.0.0.2.  You can verify  this (via any of the included software programs) when the camera is  connected to your computer.  This firmeware upgrade corrects many of the  color imbalances as well as allowing a faster shutter speed for flash  pictures (1/30th sec. vs. 1/15th), which reduces the probability of camera  shake. 3. Don't try and install the firmware upgrade (available on the  Canon website) if you have a Mac.  I don't know the genesis of the problem  (something about the USB connection or an installation glitch) but for most  people the camera freezes during upgrade, rendering it useless.  Canon can  install this for you under warranty and are very quick on turnaround.  (I  guess this is a long winded way of saying - give it a shot, but only if  you're prepared to send it to Canon anyway).I'd give it 5 stars, but the  glitch I had with the firmware upgrade irked me.

The camera is relatively small and rugged, but not as lightweight as its size would indicate.Pictures were OK using the 8 MB and 32 MB CompactFlash cards that were included in the kit, but when I used a 64 MB card, the pictures were corrupted causing a devastating loss of nearly all of the pictures on that cartridge. In other words, a digital camera owner's nightmare. I have literally trashed the camera because of this since I cannot rely on this camera.The camera has several very annoying features:1) battery life is very short even when minimizing the use of the LCD display and the 2CR5 lithium batteries cost about $12 each. You can get perhaps 50 to 60 pictures, which translates to about $0.24 per picture just for battery usage. This is too high a price to pay. When traveling, one certainly does not want to take along the somewhat bulky charger needed for the re-chargable battery pack.2) When one is using the digital zoom it is mandatory to activate the LCD, and when the LCD is running the camera gets very warm, even hot.3) When one shuts off the LCD in between shots to preserve battery power, the settings for the digital zoom disappear, requiring you to re-activate the digital zoom when you re-activate the LCD display. This is time-consuming since the digital zoom does not activate quickly.Summary: Nice size, nice shape factor. Picture quality OK. Software OK.

Spend the extra money and get the Sony.(P.S why isn't zero stars an option?)", "Date": "December 2, 2001"}, {"Title": "handy little camera with very good pictures", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R21VB4B19GPM0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received this camera as a gift last year. I have found it easy to carry in my pocket, and thus I tend to have it available to take pictures at my children's soccer practices, T ball games, and family events.  The resolution of the pictures is excellent, especially 4x6 and 5x7, which I print out on photo paper using the EPSON 890 photo printer.  In summary, a digital camera which is easy to carry, easy to use, and produces great photos.", "Date": "October 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "Una buena camara con pobre bateria", "Author": "Martin G.

Sin embargo, un punto  muy agradable de esta camara, aparte de su magnifica resolucion, es el  hecho de que los lentes Canon en esta camara son asfericos, lo cual elimina  la distorsion que existe en lentes comunes en los extremos de una  fotografia.Con esta camara se pueden tomar 2 o 3 fotos y juntarlas en  una foto panoramica con el software que trae (Adobe PhotoDeluxe 3.5)Si  amas la fotografia esta camara es la indicada, ma sno olvides comprar la  pila recargable.", "Date": "June 8, 2000"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE!", "Author": "A.
