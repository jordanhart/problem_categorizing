{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pentax Optio WG-2 Camera", "Author": "DD", "ReviewID": "RICUXYLUDBVE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am still learning the many features of this fun and versatile camera.  It is important to me as a horseback rider to have a camera that can hold up through dust, water, heat and being dropped.  For me personally, this camera is intended as a versatile point and shoot, as I have a Nikon DSLR for finer photography.  This Pentax is well-built and very tight, and offers much in terms of settings, movies, macros, a multitude of photographic options.  Because it is constructed so tightly, it does require a harder push on the shutter button, and I find it best to steady the camera with the opposite hand in order not to have camera shake.  Smaller more lightweight pocket cameras are easier to use one-handed, and that is the reason for a 4-star rating.  I have taken this camera to Las Vegas and photographed exciting displays both in- and outdoors with success, as well as animals and people.  I take it to the beach with my dog and don't worry when it is sprayed with water or sand because there is no lens that moves in and out, as there is with other P&S; cameras. I have no need for underwater photography so have no comments there.  The battery life is very good, and I have modified the settings that turn off the camera to extend battery life.  I clip the camera to a belt loop and am off.  I recommend buying the KIT that includes a charger, and extra battery and more.  Purchasing through Amazon has always been successful for me and overall, I am having a great time with this camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pentax wg2 adventure", "Author": "Ronny", "ReviewID": "R2D4A168WGY0AN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product I have had a Pentax for a few years now and found the waterproof one is the best for me as a kayaker and kayak coach it is important to have a good camera .  This camera is durable and waterproof. I noticed it had a better housing then theIr previous model, the clip that holds down the battery is stronger and better than before, on the older models it would not hold down the battery very well and would slip which made the camera stop working right in the middle of a shot .  This new one is great I carry it in my PFD  (personal  floation device)  and have it locked in....it goes with me in surf, high winds, swells and rolls with me and still keeps me ready for that one shot I want.  Thanks Pentax for the improvement.Rhonda, Gig Harbor, WA", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "delivered as advertised", "Author": "Marlene Ginter", "ReviewID": "R18025XCFOV5DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great camera that can be used under water , within limits.
