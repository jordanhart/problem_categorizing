Miller", "ReviewID": "R3H3ORN63VCXON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my girl friend for Christmas. I am impressed by it and this it's very good for the price I payed for it. I also look that you have a choice it colors such as pink, blue, green and others. My only gripe is that the buttons on the camera are a little confusing and it took a while for us to figure out how to work it properly but everything is made up for by the wonderful 8MP pictures it takes. I would recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Gift for daughter", "Author": "R. Hasty", "ReviewID": "RUPFB8GRCOWMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter. Basic picture taking/viewing is easy enough for her to catch on to very easily. Picture quality is good, although indoor images appear darker when compared to other cameras. Overall, my daughter loves being able to take and delete her own pictures and uploading them to my computer or website is very easy to do.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "ok camera", "Author": "S.
