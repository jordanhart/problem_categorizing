(As though this were a stop gap between point & shoots and DSLRs.) However, this little camera eclipses many DSLRs. The nex can be as exotic and hard to use as any DSLR with a boatload of features like PASM, panorama, special effects, video & manual focusing or as simple as a point & shoot using Intelligent Auto.F a u l t s-Battery life is bad, buy an extra battery or 2.-Menus are difficult to navigate.-Screen is hard to see on sunny days.-Can't use flash and viewfinder at the same time. Viewfinder costs extra.-Needs fastest memory available for highest speed shooting.P l u s e s-Half the size of most DSLRs and has better specs. It's fast with up to 7 shots/sec, has higher rez, panorama mode, 3D panorama mode, HD video, comes up quickly, focuses fast, shows you where it is focused onscreen, fantastic low light capabilities, uses memory sticks or SD cards, has scene modes, bracketing, full PASM menus, auto focus, manual focus, adjustable ISO, adjustable white balance, exposure and flash compensation, image stabilization, lots of flash control, rear sync-front sync-fill flash, the list goes on.-Lots of special effects included. Toy, retro, color highlighting (pick one of 4 primary colors and that color is displayed, the rest of the photo is black and white.-The 16mm wide lense has digital zoom for far away shots if you don't have time to mount the 18-55 or the 200mm.-The user manual is built into the camera. Want that special shot? Just look it up onscreen, no more manuals to drag around.-You can take it into seedy parts of town or on vacation with little worry. It's very small and looks just like a point & shoot.The race to build the largest DSLR continues and those behemoth DSLR owners continue to smirk at the nex, but that old tired technology no longer impresses. Have owned several DSLRs. A lot of big DSLR owners are using the nex for backup. Remove the mirrors and you get a small camera like the nex.Update;We are now using it for closeup product shoots. It takes much better macros than the D100.Update;With the big 18-200mm lens, it acts more like a 300mm, pulls in far away objects more so than average 200mm. Surprisingly sharp around the edges. Got the wide angle and fisheye adapter, fun and interesting photo results.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "The point and shoot I was looking for", "Author": "Alas, 'tis I!", "ReviewID": "RU1FS6G3S9VSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(I will be adding to this and making it into a real and full review as time goes on.  But...  I've already written and lost this review once - that's not going to happen again!  So, little bits at a time.  Here are a few of those...)I wanted a high-quality point-and-shoot camera.  I've always wanted one.  I've spent fair sums of money in the past on such GARBAGE as Cannon PowerShots (you can read my review on it - ha).  This time I got what I wanted.With the pancake lens on it you can almost fit it in your pocket (but not quite).  It's way light.  You can turn it on and take your first picture in under a second.  And, get this, the picture will be a good one.  Sure, you can mess around with things and get great pictures by setting the camera up manually for each shot.  Of course you can.  Just like with any camera.  But what rocks here is that you don't need to mess with things to get good shots - the auto mode is super smart and super fast.And then you _can_ change the lens.  Way cool.All told (with both lenses and other bits) it all fits nicely in a small LowePro bag (like the Edit 110).  Yes, yes, this is a little bigger than pocket size.  But, wow, it's WAY smaller and way lighter than a DSLR.  And, did I mention that it takes great pictures?Negatives?  Well, sure, it's a Sony.  That means that they steadfastly refuse to follow existing standards.  So it's not a Micro4/3.  And lenses?  Well, they say that there will be another zoom ready sometime soon.  And for only a bit more than the camera cost!  Luckily you can use it (manually) with a lens adapter and just about any lens.  But it sure would be nice to have the autofocus and all the rest when using a big lens!Mind you, I've only taken 250 pictures with it in this first week - I'm sure I'll have a lot more comments as I actually get some experience with this!Edit:I've started playing around with the other modes.  Continuous shooting is pretty sweet.  Sure, it only takes 3 shots a second, but, uh, wait.  Only?  Yeah.  It's pretty nice.  The full HD video is AWESOME.  There are a few strange things about how it works - I'm not exactly sure (might have to, gasp, read the manual) how it focuses (you might have to hit the camera button to get the focus to change) and I'm not really sure how to start or stop a movie but...  But the resulting movie is of an absolutely amazingly high quality.  Dang!Quick comments...  As for point and shoot, the thing that is, perhaps, the most impressive compared to normal portables is that the colors are right on.  Well.  There's that, of course.  But the automatic mode is pretty darned amazing all by itself.  I guess I didn't mention, but it shows you, on the screen, the mode that it has chosen for a given shot.  Rather than just saying auto it will say, \"Night Portrait\" or whatever.  I suppose this could help you learn to better manually set modes.  But, hey, why bother when it usually choses the right one all by itself?  And so fast!Live view is awesome!  I guess that was another of the features I was looking for.  And here, well, it's not just an extra - it's the only way to take a picture.  Which is fine by me - this is exactly what I wanted!  The screen is so sharp and so clear that you know right away what you're getting - there's no guessing how a picture is going to look in the end.  I love this thing!There is a pretty darned good review of the camera on, um.  On the web.  Let's see...  On Unique Photo's site.  They've taken a lot of pictures and some video so you can see what a pro can do with the camera.  Pretty impressive!Let's see...  What else?  Well, I chose this one over the Nex3 because you get the metal body and the full HD video mode.  For the use I'm making of it (lots of snapshots of children and pets, largely) this is working great for me.Edit: well, upgrading the firmware sure changed things!  Movie mode comes up instantly now, for example.  Whoa.  But...  But I get a histogram on every shot I take and the menu option doesn't turn this off!  I don't care about the histogram - I want to see what my shot looks like!!!  Now, I could screw around for hours more trying to figure out how to really turn that off (since the menu option doesn't do it!) but, get this, I'm not going to!  I want a quick an easy camera to use!  That's it!The autofocus is weird, now, too.  The camera comes on instantly - with the last focus setting.  To get it to focus on something else I have to hold the shot button half-way in for more than a second.  What is up with that?  A HUGE step backwards!  Arg!  Well, that and the histogram that just won't go away!  Arg arg!Still...  I've taken ~1500 shots now (508 on one day.  Ahem!) and I love it.  I can shoot from the hip and get a great shot almost every time I try (not every shot is good - but I have it in rafale mode and almost always take 4+ shots at a go).  I have discovered that there is a limit, alas, to rafale mode...  It will only take ~50 shots in quick succession before it has to pause to write to disk.  Maybe if I had a faster memory card I could get more shots in...Edit: So, not only is there rafale mode but there's speed rafale mode.  Holy cow is it ever fast!  It's so fast that in a couple of seconds the memory falls behind and the pix stop while the camera catches up.  This is speed priority so unless you're in ideal conditions the picture quality isn't as good as in other modes but it is very sweet for trying to get a good picture of a wiggly pet (in good light).It does come up quickly (even in V3 firmware) with the pancake lens.  But, well, I'm just not using that one any more.  I really like the 18-55!  No, it's not really pocket-sized with that.  But it is awfully compact and well protected in one of the leather fitted cases.  I've taken at least 3k more photos and had some really really nice ones as a result!  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  500+ shots on one charge (I haven't run the battery down to lower than 50%).  The only problem I'm having with it now is that it's become a real chore to sort through and tweak all of the shots I've taken!  I don't know what to do with them all!Edit (probably the last one!): I bought the Sony remote, too.  We got some awesome family pictures taken!  It took me a while to figure out how to use it (to set up the camera) but it is awesome!

Sumner \"momsumner\"", "ReviewID": "R123OAXS98RVLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am about the lamest person ever with a camera. My hands shake all the time, so it is difficult for me to get a good picture. I was frustrated with my canon compact digital since indoor pictures come out fuzzy. I finally got to the point I stopped taking pictures. I went back and forth with the idea of buying a DLSR (DSLR? Shows you how lame I am) but the thought of having to understand the technical stuff of shooting pictures terrified me. This camera is so easy! I turned it on and have taken about 200 pictures over the last few days. Ever single one of them is a keeper! I love the \"defocus background\" feature, just makes portraits and pictures of my flowers pop out! I feel like a professional and yet so far from it. I also like that the camera gives you hints how to improve your picture taking skill. And the coolest feature ever, the smile detector. How do they do that? I have a grandbaby and you know how difficult it is to get pictures of a toddler? This camera actually detects a smile and takes the picture for you! I am so happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Glorified Point and Shoot", "Author": "G.W.", "ReviewID": "R1SXXD1OGKVTUP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After carrying this camera around for a couple months and shooting thousands of photos, I've come to the conclusion that this camera was a complete waste of money. I wanted DSLR quality in a compact profile, but this camera isn't even close to DSLR quality, forget the sensor size. If you're just want a better point and shoot, this camera might work for you--except that it's a lot bigger and more expensive than a high quality point and shoot. So, really, there's no point to this camera. Here's why:Excessive noise even at the lowest ISO: I've taken many pictures Even when everything is perfect on the camera, there are unacceptable levels of noise in skies and dark areas on the image. A decent DSLR will not show noise at these levels. Also, it only goes to ISO 200. Most DSLRs will go to ISO 100.AutoFocus is not crisp. Forget crystal clarity. Everything comes out soft and slightly out of focus.No EVF. Using this camera in the bright light of the Mediterranean, I was shooting blind, even when using a screen hood.No hot shoe or adapter. The puny little flash that ships with the camera has very little practical use. Since there's no hot shoe or adapter, you can't use any external flash or remote accessories.Accessory lenses are very expensive and only of moderate quality. Using the adapter and buying alternate lenses results in a severe loss of functionality.Sony. They are unwilling to own up to the poor quality of the product and will not accept returns--only repairs. How do you repair bad design and poor quality? Not only do I recommend a different camera. I'd also encourage you to use a different manufacturer.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than a DSLR non-pros", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R11H9JYXSABJLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my girlfriend who is neither a professional nor is very knowledgeable about camera fundamentals like f-stop and ISO settings.  This is the perfect camera for someone who is tired of the OK pics you get from a point and shoot and is ready for much better image quality but without going the extreme of buying a high-end DSLR (and the learning curve that comes with it).  This camera even makes an effort to teach you what you are doing by displaying help messages anytime you pause on a setting for more than 1 or 2 seconds (e.g. the setting to change the ISO points out the different between a low and a high ISO setting).  Furthermore, I just can't see any non-professional woman carrying around a huge DSLR body camera.  With the pancake lens attached, this camera isn't much bigger than the Sony point-and-shoots from 5 years ago (anyone remember the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P200? [...] this camera is only slightly bigger but probably weighs less).  Even with the 18-55mm lens attached its still not too big for her to handle.  Also I'm usually one of the first to jump on the Sony-hater bandwagon for their proprietary formats, but I love that the e-mount lenses are able to auto-focus just by holding the shutter button half way down (like a point and shoot).  This was one of the biggest reasons I purchased this camera for her.  I knew she wouldn't like using it if she had to manually focus every shot.  If you never took the camera out of iAuto or \"P\" mode it would work great like an advanced point-and-shoot camera that delivers great picture quality even in scenarios where a point-and-shoot can't (e.g. low-light situations that might require a tripod can probably be handled by this camera in iAuto mode while its being held).  Then as the user learns more about the various settings and understands how the aperture and ISO influence the picture, they can switch to the more advanced modes and fine tune every detail of the shot.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "sony nex 5", "Author": "LOU", "ReviewID": "R25UGUUM8HO2YR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not decide between the Sony NEX 5 and the GF1 Panasonic.I bought both.Both felt good but the Sony clearly was what I wanted, after handling both.It was noticeably lighter and felt great.I am not a high end photographer but just want to take good pictures and the Sony makes it easy and fun.I find the menus very easy and intuitive.I was concerned with it not having a built in flash. This is ONLY a positive. I put the flash on and have left it on. It is very low profile and does not detract from the \"smallness\" of the camera. Just flip it up when you need it and shoot.The videos are GREAT. I have a sony digital camcorder and I like the NEX 5 videos better.

I wouldn't consider myself a pro by any means so I was very hesitate buying a DSLR, not so much because of the money, I know a good camera is going to cost a little more then a point and shoot, but mostly because of the size and it seemed like you had to really know how to use that type of camera to take a good shot.  After much research I decided on the NEX 5 with both lenses.  This is the perfect camera for me.Pros:-Size, you can't beat this camera, it takes photos just as well if not better then the big DSLR.-Easy to use; this is just as easy to use as a point and shoot, but the quality of the pics are 100x better, also you can take 7 pics in one second! and do the awesome background defocus.-Price, I would have paid a little more for this given what I know now.Cons:Strap is a little cheap, you can find a better one on amazon for under 10 bucksWish the screen was a touch screen, that would just make it easier to use.Overall I think this is the perfect camera for someone looking for the ease of a point and shoot and the quality of a DSLR.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, instructions easy to find", "Author": "G.

I absolutely love the picture quality, the portability, and the build quality.  I think most of the reviews already captured the major pros and cons of this camera so I won't cover any of that here.This review covers the nightmare firmware update.I've owned this camera for a couple weeks and I read that there was a firmware update available.  My camera was at V1 and I wanted it updated to V3.  I downloaded the firmware from the Sony site using a month new ASUS U43 laptop running Windows 7 home professional.  I followed the instruction exactly.  In the middle of the update, I was notified of an update error and to try running the software again.  I tried running it again and again, and all I got was an error every single time.  In the meantime, my camera is now a brick.  It won't power on at all, no menus, nothing.  A red LED is glowing near the battery and won't shut off unless I remove the battery.  There is nothing I can do to get my camera back up and running.  I tried different USB ports, and I tried different USB cables with the same disastrous results.  My camera is DEAD.I finally try on another computer.  This time, I grab a 10 year old laptop running Windows XP and I download the XP version of the Firmware Update Software.  Finally, success on the first try.

The Hoodman loupe transforms the way I use the NEX-5. I can shoot in all light conditions and see in great detail what the colors will be and what shadow detail and highlight detail can be captured. Unlike most cameras, the SOny NEX-5 shows you exactly what you will get when you display the picture on a monitor, because the brightness/contrast/color of the display changes to match the exposure conditions you have selected - i.e it doesn't brighten up as you swing into shadow areas of the scene. What you see in the viewer is exactly what you will see on the monitor.The second important thing is that you can mount hundreds of high quality prime lenses, because there is a lens adapter for just about every manual focus prime lens made in the last 60 years. If you put a Leica Summicron lens on the NEX-5 you will make some great pictures. I shoot with Leica, Nikon, Pentax and CSV primes - each has its own special quality. I haven't used the two lenses that came with the body (Sony) since I got the Novoflex adapter for the Leica lenses. I looked at the NEX-7 and didn't like the finder. The Optical viewfinder of my M6 doesn't compare with the Hoodman on the NEX-5. The combination of NEX-5 and Leica/Nikon primes will transform the way you shoot. The Nikon Micro-Nikkor which focusses to 9\" has the most accurate and sensitive focus ability of any of my lenses and you can focus tack sharp without zooming the displayed image.
