I built a weather proof enclosure for it with a Lexan front lens and set it up at the right distance, configured the camera with no problems.  It took pictures for about 10 days and then as evidenced by its own capture the lens just slowly starts to move and over the course of about 2 hours just falls off the camera.The wide angle lens snaps to the camera with a cheap trinket style magnetic ring and the magnetic ring is only attached to the camera lens by some even cheaper glue and apparently the glue after 10 days just decided to slip loose form the camera lens.  I read a similar comment in a review before I bought this camera but I ignored it.  Big mistake.  If you decide to ignore my reviews please only use it for close images where the wide angle lens is not needed or only if you can check on it frequently.I was not able to due to the distance so I lost the first 4 weeks of the construction which was the most dramatic in terms of the building coming up out of the ground.  I can never go back and get that so I am extremely unhappy with this product.  If I could still return it and get my money back I would definitely do so.Unfortunately if you are looking there are not really many other cameras that will run user controlled time lapse unattended for long periods of time.  Camera quality in High Res mode is only 1240 x 780 and should be a lot higher.  I also bought the 32 GB SD card which really wasn't necessary because four weeks of capture every 10 minutes only occupied about 137 MB.I would of appreciated a much better user guide too to give me some guidelines on settings.  The guide leave a lot to be desired for example you can choose AVI frame rate but they give no hints as to the impact it has to storage needs or final movie quality.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun toy, but has it's problems", "Author": "Jinx McElroy", "ReviewID": "RDSN2TDHO5C4O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Link to footage shot with Brinno TLC200[...] (Amazon doesn't allow linking to youtube, so go there and search \"NATURE'S RECLAMATION OF RUDOLF - Brinno TLC200 time lapse test - ANAKRID\")My review of the Brinno TLC200 after conducting this test: As you can see, the camera is able to do what it advertises: take time-lapse video. However, there are many problems with this camera. Much of the initial footage was lost due to some problem with the camera losing *entire files* (which take hours to create). This is why the images in this film jump from very little decimation of the creature to intense putrefaction. All of the in-between footage was lost (including what should have been footage of a vulture working on poor Rudolf!). This problem with lost footage was solved by a download of a firmware update from the Brinno site. If you purchase this camera it is *imperative* that you download this update - you will save yourself many headaches. The camera handles bright sunlight very poorly and much footage had to be thrown out because of blown-out images. Overall it has absolutely terrible dynamic range. The color needed major correction in Sony Vegas and even with that, it still isn't hot. It is essentially a toy camera. Having said that, it is capable of capturing some wonderful images (if you get lucky). I got this camera on sale for very cheap. If you can score one for a low cost, I'd recommend it to play with - but I wouldn't use it for any critical projects.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have several of these now", "Author": "David W Anderson", "ReviewID": "RP70KA83TV2A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like these cameras so much that I ordered another one.  Based on the TLC 200, I also ordered the TCL200 F1.2 (2) and the TLC Pro.  I am using four Brinno's at work for profit and two at home for personal fun.I sincerely love them all.  As a professional videographer, I was prepared to be quite critical, as I have used \"trail cams\" in the past which really didn't provide the video quality I was looking for. But, I haven't found any real problems. The video quality is perfect for the task.  I've also tested the GoPro, which is a fine video camera, but better for real-time video than time-lapse, as the battery life is very short.The Brinno has an exceptional battery life.  I leave them up for weeks and weeks without changing batteries. They are easy to use and do exactly what they are advertised to do.  Sure, you can buy a time-lapse rig for $4,500.00 that offers more features, but it's also very, very expensive.The Brinno cameras are perfectly suited for their task and offer various types of lenses in different models, with removeable lenses in the pro model.  I have read other's comments and I have not experienced any of the issues they cite.Overall, I love these cameras.  And, I'm making money with most of mine : -)  The others are for me to play with!FYI - I do not work for, nor am I compensated by Brinno.  I'm just a happy customer.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun project, terrible interface", "Author": "D.

The batteries last about three months, but there is no alarm or warning light on the camera to tell you when the battery is getting low, it's easy to miss a couple days' pictures.Also, the interface for the camera is so opaque that I am not sure whether I've got it running properly. After waiting 3 months for the second segment of the time lapse movie (spring), I discovered that it had not been taking pictures at all for that three months. That was very disappointing. The third segment (summer) came out fine, but I'm really not certain how to confirm whether it is taking pictures now. I'll have to wait till February to see if I did it right.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nothing but glowing things to say! Wow!", "Author": "J.

We also bought a TimelapseCam 8.0 from Wingscapes.Avoid that camera.Anyway, the Brinno just amazed me! The battery life is phenomenal! On 2 AA batteries, it runs for 4 or 5 days. This is what I experiences having it take a photo every 10 seconds.I also love the way that it puts the stills together for you. I do video editing with Premiere, and was planning on taking still frames and making them into a timelapse video on my own, but I couldn't be happier with the quality of the video that the camera makes itself!You can choose the frames per second that you want your video to be made into. It is .AVI format.You can also just have it export stills and put them together by yourself, but I see no need to do it.With the shaking of our building, the camera fell down from the suction cup mount that we had it on several times. It is durable! It still works great.It is small and light and aesthetically pleasing.I really couldn't be happier with this camera. Great product!We also used the wide-angle attachment. This gave us a bit of a wider view. It connects to the lens via a magnet and a metal ring around the lens on the camera. Sturdy and good quality.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Brinno TLC200", "Author": "Gary Stapp", "ReviewID": "RR0LHR6OFLLM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want to do time lapse, this camera is for you. At first I was a little disappointed in the shapness of the video quality but after their firmware update in september 2013, it did improve video quality and added more features to the camera. One of the features it added was the ability to set specific times for time lapse such as from 9 a.m. to 3:30p.m. or whatever time you want to use. Another thing about the camera that's really good is the power saving mode. I did an eleven week time lapse with 22 minutes between each frame, and the battery indicator never moved off full. The video I made was a banana going ripe and its posted on the most famous video site under my name. The title of the video is called \"bananagoingripe\". You have to type my name in the search bar, gary stapp,then scroll down to  see it. The camera makes videos instantly on the sd card but you have to view them on a computer or use an adapter on your smart phone, which I have, to view your video. Another feature the firmware update added was the ability to under or over expose your video 2 stops, which comes in handy under certain lighting conditions. I do recommend a 32gigabyte class 10 card which amazon sells for around 20 dollars. Its a Sony sd card. Another great option the camera has is low light recording, in other words you can set the camera to stop recording when light gets low, like if you do outdoor recording and night comes, the camera will stop recordind when it gets dark, then start automatically when it gets daylight. The camera will go into sleep mode while recording and to wake it up yoiu have to press the ok button. Over all this is great for doing time lapse and I want to get one or two more cameras in the future to have while doing time lapse with the other camera.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Completely unreliable.

(I didn't change any settings except to activate the LED light when a frame is being captured.)At any rate, I just wrapped up a three-week timelapse video, and the frames were all captured perfectly, and transfer to my computer was simple. I was very impressed by the low power consumption, and relatively small filesize of the rendered AVI. I was using this in an office environment to capture change of one of our visualization systems over a release cycle, and it was unobtrusive. I used it in conjunction with one of the Joby Gorillapods to wrap it around someone's desk, and it didn't bother them, either.My only real complaint is a feature request: I wish I could get the individual stills instead of a rendered video file without having to use mplayer to dump them to disk.================Previous review:This camera turns off after 5 to 10 seconds of capture. Hitting the buttons on the back of the device do nothing; I have to power it off and back on again to get it to respond. The green LED that would indicate recording also turns off, so at least that's consistent.The display is incredibly bad. I had a better screen on my cellphone ten years ago--no exaggeration--which there's basically no need for in this day and age. The camera won't give you the raw images; only rendered video, which further decreases its usefulness. I only wish there had been more reviews before I took the plunge. Here's to hoping this saves someone else the time, trouble, and money.(FWIW, I read the manual cover to cover, and this definitely isn't user error.

Fernandez", "ReviewID": "RQ7XQTO7AN4U8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent two days trying to dump videos from camera to my computer using a usb cable. Then I learned from another review that the usb cable is only for external power. I had to buy a card reader and remove the SD card from the camera each time to transfer videos to my computer for viewing. The poorly written manual and description of this camera on amazon needs to be more clear on this fact. I was very frustrated during those two days and almost returned it. Another problem is the small LED that blinks as it takes pics. It's impossible to see outside in bright light and you really don't know if it's actually taking the shots that you want. A brighter, bigger LED would help. Once I struggled through the learning curve, I am very pleased with the videos I have taken with it. I highly recommend that you get a IKEA egg timer to take sweeping videos ( up to 360*) with the camera riding on top of it. It's less than a smooth sweep, but it works. Check on youtube for samples of videos taken using this technique. I'm very pleased that batteries last a long time with the Brinno TLC 200. I'd recommend this fun gadget to anyone who enjoys playing with time lapse videos. I was also pleased that vids from this camera can be processed in my Pinnacle Studio HD Ultimate Collection program to add music and other effects. Also upgrade to the 32 Gig SD card so you have lots of space for your creations. I wish this neat little camera was waterproof. Maybe the next model will upgrade some features.
