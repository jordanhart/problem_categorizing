You can get it for a bit less if you shop around.  The camera is very easy to use, and takes very clear pictures. My daughter uses it to take pictures all of the time and she loves it. If you want to pay a little more than you might normally consider for a camera that a teen would love, or if you want to buy a lower priced, quality camera for an adult, this fits the bill. I would use this camera myself.

Martin", "ReviewID": "R2SR1RC0HB79LW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Olympus 760 about a month ago because my last camera (an Olympus Stylus 400) broke.  I was reluctant to buy another Olympus because of a design flaw in the old camera, which was only 3 years old.But I had narrowed it down to a Canon or the 760 and ultimately bought the Olympus as I could use my old memory chip and the same battery and cords from my old camera (So I thought).  Turns out the battery and cords are different.I was also concerned about the about the screen on the prior Olympus Stylus (710?) seemed to have some problems with the screen cracking and many reviewers noted how bad the Oylmpus customer service is.But so far the camera has been great.  Hopefully, they have gotten all the bugs out.  I love all the features, the size, its weatherproof, and it looks great.  The pictures are excellent, the stabalization seems to work well, and it even takes decent pictures with just available light.  I would have given it five stars if it weren't for my previous experience with Olympus -- I'm leaving one star off to see how the new camera holds-up.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "disappointing", "Author": "D. Barbour", "ReviewID": "R2PHIZ1P5TRUNT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Olympus Stylus 760 to replace my 2.1 Megapixel Olympus that I purchased years ago.  While I love my old Olympus, I wanted to replace it with something a little smaller and lighter.  I have been very disappointed with the new 760 - the pictures are terrible!  I even took the first one back, thinking it was defective (the new one is a little better).  I have done a number of comparison shots between my old digital and the 760 and the 760 shots are much worse in all lighting conditions!  I have been able to fix some of the problems with the Olympus software, but I can't do that for every shot I take.  The problems are bad blurring of any movement of the camera or subject in lower light conditions (dusk and indoor incandescent lighting) even with the anti-vibration turned on.  Even in good, outdoor lighting the camera is sometimes out of focus, poor auto read of lighting balance, and then there is that viewscreen which is useless outdoors.  I am planning to take this one back and try a different brand.  I have always had good luck with Olympus for both film and digital photography but something is seriously wrong with the Stylus 760!", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Robert Prijic \"Lucas Prijic\"", "ReviewID": "R3JQLEXC5C5A0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first camera I have purchased and I am glad i did it takes great pictures and good videos but you cant zoom in too far on the videos or it gets blurry.

This was an emergency replacement camera replacing our fantastic Fujifilm Finepix camera that is not being made anymore (it fell into a pool and cameras don't like that).  The Olympus appears to be fairly well made and looks good in the ice blue color.  But that is about where the good stuff ends.Pros:1.  Camera functions are fairly easy to use.  The custom photo settings (i.e. \"sunset\", \"portrait\", etc.) actually work surprisingly well.  Like more and more of these cameras, a viewfinder has been eliminated, a big irritant when shooting in very bright light situations.2.  Picture quality is very good.  We don't usually print our photos, instead we just look at them on the computer and send them around to friends and family.  Even set at lesser megapixels the pictures are fine.Cons:1.  The stupid - no ridiculously ignorant - way to charge the camera's battery.  You must take the battery out of the camera and place it into a huge (bigger than the camera) plastic box that has a mile-long electric cord on it to charge the battery.  I hate this most of all about the camera.  If Olympus couldn't have come up with any other way to charge it, at least the charger module could have been made more compact and have a flip-away plug that would plug directly into the wall without a cord.  The current charger feels like a big empty plastic box designed to take up too much room in your luggage.  Our old Fujifilm FinePix camera had a drop-in cradle to both charge the battery and download the pix without having to deal with cords, chargers, etc.  I now know how much of a great set up this was.2.  Battery life is poor to miserable.  If you choose to use the anti-shake system of the camera, the battery will not last even one day of reasonable use.  We turned it permanently off and it still didn't last as long as any of the older digital cameras we've owned, but at least we got one or two days of use out of it.  On a vacation this is very irritating.3.  Customer service is non-existant.  I sent Olympus a simple question about the camera (\"Does the battery trickle-charge when the camera is plugged into a computer via the USB cable?\").  I got the immediate electronic confirmation that my question is \"so very important to us\" and \"will be answered within XX hours\".  This was over a month ago and I never got a response.  Oh, I figured out that the stupid camera does NOT charge the battery when plugged in.  In fact the opposite occurs, it drains it even if it is not turned on!  Yet another engineered irritant about the camera.  My Palm PDA and cell phone both trickle charge when connected to a computer.  Stupid, stupid and more stupid.I just wish I hadn't thrown away the original box.  I would have returned this camera after our vacation, but alas now I'm stuck with it.  Hopefully it will get stolen or I \"accidentally\" drop it in the pool so I can get a new one without feeling guilty about it.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "A fuzzy camera", "Author": "Paul C", "ReviewID": "R2G5B8SUHLSMRZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "An unwise purchase. I bought this for a specific use: to shoot pictures on mountain bike trips, and was attracted by the shockproof/splashproof/size features. My 14 yr old son had one of these, and was raving about it. Unwisely I did not look closely at the images he was taking. So when it arrived and I tried it out, I found it gave unacceptably fuzzy scenery images, with unexciting colours, and moving targets also were fuzzy. Thinking it defective, I then did a close comparison with the results of my son's camera, shooting the same photos on each. Same result. I tried with and without image stabilisation, auto ISO vs fixed ISO etc, to no avail. So now am trying to sell/return the camera, and at same time telling our son it's just my camera that is a dud.As a family we have had many digital cameras. Mainly Canon Powershot (3 in last 10 years), also 3 Panasonic Lumix (2 large, one pocket) and a Sony. These are more expensive, but considerably better quality, and the cameras we now use normally are both Lumix. This is our comparison, and I at least expected the Olympus to take good quality pictures. For scenery neither of our two 760s do, and seem to go back to the quality of mid-1990s digitals.My last 2 Canon Powershot both stopped working because the sensors died, after 4-5 years. I took the latest, a 2003 Powershot S400, into repair just now and was quoted an impossible $300. But while there I saw and checked out the bottom range Canon A460, for $99 on Amazon approx. Certainly without the size or robust features of the Olympus, but the picture quality seemed very good in comparison. At half price, I think this will be a better bet for mountain biking!", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price", "Author": "Allie", "ReviewID": "R3BW3HL77NZ42O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use on my family vacation, plus I just love the pink color! It is a great camera, but just take the time to learn how to use it. It has a lot of scenes and it is important to know when to use which one in order to take a better picture. The only downfall was that all my pictures from my vacation were taken on HQ and not SHQ so when I expanded them, they were a little fuzzy. Just make sure you keep it on SHQ if you plan on enlarging your pictures. And in the sun it is hard to see what you are taking a picture of, but that happens in all the digital cameras. Overall it's a great camera. It's small, has a very large screen, and takes great pictures.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "narnar", "ReviewID": "R32Z0ZYSILBV7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had this very long, but it's been great so far. The blue color is very faint, barely noticeable. I hate reading directions and have really not had to. The camera is pretty user friendly. I like the size.

The camera arrived very promptly with no problems, and I had no problem charging the battery and inserting the memory card. I bought it for my boyfriend who tends to rough up electronics, so that is another reasoon why I chose this camera, as it advertises being weather proof (to a certain degree obviously) and reinforced a big more securely than other cameras, including the Sony digital camera I own. It takes great pictures and the battery is very long lasting. I was very pleased with my purchase, and so is my boyfriend.
