{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Cyber-Shot T90 vs Canon Power Shot SD780IS", "Author": "Kimmy", "ReviewID": "R1Z5WUO0HDMQPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I conducted this side by side comparison, I purchased and returned the Olympus Tough 6000, Casio EX FC-100 and Casio Exilim EX-S10.  The Olympus took awful pictures. The S10 was just blah - no real feature improvements of the Exilim 5MP I have now. The FC-100 was just too big.So yes, I am picky!  I wanted a small, sexy, functioning, easy to use, superior camera.  I was torn between the Canon Powershot 780IS and Sony Cyber-Shot T90.  I visited with both at a retail store and was still undecided - besides Amazon prices were much cheaper.  I ordered both and did a side by side comparison in my home. The Canon went back - sorry Powershot.Here's the scoop. Just for base leveling - I just like to take good pictures of my dogs and garden and husband and just life. I'm not a professional. I mostly post my pictures facebook or email - very rarely do I print.Both cameras were sexy and small.  Both were hefty and felt solid.  Both require you remove the battery to charge it.  That's about where the similarities end.The Canon menu interface was clunky and not intuitive.  I have not used either brand of camera in the past - so I have no bias from previous experience.  Simple things like changing the picture setting took a couple minutes to figure out.  The Sony has a touch screen - which at first I thought was just hype.  I mean really, Ashton is cute and all - but I don't need a touch screen. Then I used it!! It rocks!! Very easy to navigate. Quick to learn and very functional. The T90 is almost completely automatic.  The only feature missing is the \"make me look skinny\" setting. Plus in auto mode - the camera tells you which setting is selected (portrait, landscape, gourmet food- seriously).  So you don't have to worry if your mountains will look like sushi or vice versa.  The smile detection comes on automatically when you take a picture of a face.  It's doesn't work on dogs - but it did recognize a Barbie doll face. There are tons of features - like touching the screen to focus on a person or object for the auto focus.  Smile settings - little smile, medium, and big. The screen is a nice size for viewing and sharing on the spot.  And seriously, it has a gourmet food setting. I have no idea why- but it's cool. There is also a beach setting, snow setting and underwater setting (camera is not waterproof).The big deal breaker was the picture quality. I took at picture of the same scenes with both cameras at the same time. Both camera set to auto setting and then set to landscape.  I uploaded all pictures to my laptop and viewed them in the format and size directly from the camera. The Sony pictures were more vibrant, had more detail and were crisp.  I asked my husband to look at a side by side of the pictures - he picked the Sony pictures, as well.  I also tested the image stabilization on both cameras. The Sony again was superior.  Neither camera did well when I jumped up a down while taking a shot. But, the Sony outperformed on hand wobbling.  So, done!!  The Sony won.The Sony also has less shutter lag and shorter \"boot up time\".  I love the touch screen.  The camera is small, easy to use and fun. The picture quality is great.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Let me take a moment to gush over my T90", "Author": "D. Campbell", "ReviewID": "R23W2NSS551D3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since Tuesday and it's Friday and I'm still amazed. I've spent hours trying to learn my way around the menu, taking pictures, recording videos. I previously owned the Sony W150, but I upgraded for something much smaller. I've used the Panasonic Lumix and I've tried different Canon cameras, but the T90 takes the cake. This camera is sleek! The black casing is sexy :). I've tried all the Rec modes, except landscape. I still need to try the 6 scene selection modes. Overall, The photos are beautiful. The intelligent scene recognition mode is truly amazing. I tried to simulate several scenes in my living room/ kitchen with the windows open or closed, lights on or off. The camera was able to clearly identify the scene, backlight, or even when I simply desired to take a macro shot of my fingers to see all the wrinkles(unbelievable what scene recognition does)! As of now, I am happy and I have no regrets with my purchase. The battery does not last as long as my Sony W150, but it's good enough. I also picked up the Sony infolithium battery on here for like $38 (bought it through Amazon for peace of mind). I also purchased the 8gb MS Pro Duo Mark2 through Amazon for $44. Best Buy is selling the 8gb Mark 2 for $39.99 on sale right now until 5/2 (I wish I purchased it through BB, but it's only five dollars so whatever). I also purchased my camera through Best Buy for $299.99 plus tax (If only I would have checked Amazon's pricing before buying). Well despite all of that, the camera is absolutely wonderful. The honeymoon phase is going great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Hopefully, months from now I'm still happy with this camera.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "I have big cameras for great shots, but I needed a small camera that could still get great shots.", "Author": "Tony Ramos \"NewLondon\"", "ReviewID": "R6Y63JHFQRM85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In short, I love travel.  I always have at least two cameras with me.  But I needed a camera for those times that I didn't want to look like a tourist, but I still wanted great photos.  You know, those dress-up events and such.  Or even those wonderful photo oportunities that you may stumble upon.  This camera covered the need precisely.  It has some features that even my larger cameras don't have like Face Detection.  My only real advice to anyone who buys the camera is that you ALWAYS use the hand strap.  This is a tiny camera that has a touch sensive screen with many buttons on the camera's edges.  So you have to gingerly hold it and it may slip from such a grip.  Otherwise, this is a GREAT camera that can fit into a pocket.  But do get the Sony brand carry case.  You can use it or leave it behind.  But always store the camera in this case to protect the viewscreen.  And be very aware to keep the lens over the flash clean.  Any \"gunk\" over this screen can be heated up by the flash to a permanent coating that will change the flash values.  And may I also add, the time from \"power on\" to first picture is very brief.  That's important to me.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little camera!", "Author": "Chris R.

I wanted to get her the features she wanted, but i also wanted to make sure she wouldnt be disappointed with the images is captures.  With a handful of these touchscreen cameras on the market, the pickings are slim.Basically if you want DSLR quality you need a DSLR, if you wife wants a cute sexy slick little pink camera to throw in her purse and can be the source of almost endless entertinment, this camera nails it on the head 100%The pics are good. In daylight they are real good. In the garage playing beerpong at night with some friends they pics are somewhat grainy. But no more than any other P&S; camera.The touchscreen is not the same as an ipod, it is a little soft to the touch, but far far far more responsive than that piece of garbage cellphone called the Incite by LG.Not QUITE as good as Ipod Touch screens, but a very close 2nd and very usable.it has a lot of little neat features, you can make people smile if they werent smiling, you can give things a fish eye appearance, make things sparkle, you can draw on the screen and do all kinds of stuff with stamps, borders, etc..this camera pretty much embodies everything that a seasoned photographer despises about new cameras, but i have to admit this little gizmo is a lot of fun to play around with.Ill give it a full 5 out of 5 stars because while the image quality is not to my snobby DSLR user standard, it is 100% everything she was looking for, she absolutly loves it.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very cool camera", "Author": "... \"esizzle\"", "ReviewID": "R3CQ1K51D2XJ21", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The pictures from this camera are very clear, and the touch screen is a nice feature. The one thing I would recommend is that you buy memory, as the internal memory in the camera is extremely low.The high resolution of the pictures take up a lot of space. This camera is very tiny so I could see how some people complained about the touch screen but I have normal sized fingers and got the hang of it quickly. The camera is slightly larger than a Motorola razor, is very thin and ultra portable, but it seems that a drop could demolish it. But all things aside I am very pleased with it. if you are looking for something that can take abuse try the Olympus stylus tough 8000 I hear that it can take abuse like a UFC fighter. The Sony how ever has excellent picture quality, and is very easy to use and carry around. I gave it four stars because it does not seem like it could survive abuse, so I would not recommend this for a child.

It's so small and thing, so easy to use as well. it's not complicated with all these buttons and what makes it easier is that this camera has automatic shooting...where if u went outside, it'd automatically go to \"landscape\" mode or to where ur taking a picture of one person only, it'd change to \"portrait\". I love it! It's easy to also switch to several megapixel sizes so you can load pictures easier on computer and the quality is the same no matter what the size is!

Auto mode really does work on this camera. It detects the best settings for the shot PLUS it takes two pictures with two best possible settings!!! This is really handy when shooting with low light.3.

The photo quality is great and it has a sleek design but the touch-screen is so weak that it easily cracks.  My second one just cracked so I felt compelled to write a review. In this most recent case, the camera was just in my front jeans pocket and cracked due to the pressure from walking around (I don't wear tight jeans).I have other touch-screen devises (iphone, blackberry, etc.) and have never head a problem.  The screen on this camera feels different though; it flexes when you touch it.  Since most of the camera's controls are operated through the screen (as well as the viewfinder), when it's cracked the camera is basically worthless. Also, because you have to be so careful with it, you don't use it as much as you might other cameras.I will not be buying this camera again; I'll get one that has a more solid construction.Hope this is helpful.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pocket Digi cam", "Author": "Dipak", "ReviewID": "R3DZ41WEVR7546", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent pocket digital cam.

Figie", "ReviewID": "R3JP28UKAWXTNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new camera because my wife's old Canon Powershot had died (a 5 year old camera).  She gets all my hand-me-downs so I gave her my other Canon Elf camera.  This was a good camera but it had problems with the lense and its image stabilizing feature.  You see, I ride roller coasters and put camera in my pocket sometimes and it had a easy power on button and would try and extend the lense and not be able to so it would jam.  I had sent it back to the manufacturer twice in less then a year.  So I was kind of glad I had to buy a new camera.  I was thinking of the DSC-T900 but decided that the DSC-T90 was basically the same but cheaper (smaller display I think is all that is different for almost $100 more).  I am still learning all the capabilities of this camera but it really surpassed my expectations.  I like to take night shots of roller coasters and around amusement parks and it was GREAT at doing this when I set the ISO setting to max.  It was great and very easy to use.  Menus are very intuative.  Love that it protects the lense with the cover and no lense getting extended.  Plus it records video nicely and is 12.5 Mega Pixels.  I am totally happy.  I even showed a slideshow on the flat screen TV in my hotel room (including music supplied by the camera).  My only complaint is that I probably only get about 40 to 50 shots on a charge.  I also had a problem with the memory stick I purchased but I think it is a bad memory stick.  I would suggest getting a backup battery and alwsys download your photos ASAP to a desktop or laptop to protect them from getting screwed up in the camera.

I didn't really find that.  Once I had set my preferences, I have had no call to alter them since.  Pictures are very clear and sharp.  I did find the lens cover a little different to deal with at first, but now I am used to it.I cannot really comment upon how good or bad the battery life is as I have not really subjected it to sustained use, or, a long video session.I am not really a \"photo buff\" but this camera has exceeded my expectations in regard to quality and ease of use.  It does everything that I want it to do and more.  I just wish I had never wasted my money on the Olympus to begin with.The only con with this camera is that you really do need to purchase extra memory (but this is not confined to Sony; most camera makes are the same).  It arrives with enough memory to take a few pictures.  I already had compatible memory and once I installed it I was told that I had enough capacity to take 10,000 pictures at 3 mega pixels.  I haven't yet worked out how many battery charges will be needed to achieve that!Bottom line; I can't speak highly enough about this camera.  Most camera reviews in this class are mediocre at best and obviously you get what you pay for; but for a non-professional who wants a camera that takes good pictures in a variety of situations, then this is probably a camera worthy of further investigation.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just got it", "Author": "M.

There's something about these Sony point-and-shoots that make for really attractive and colorful photos that are sharp and of a very high quality.  Oddly enough I find that the best pictures are taken in 5MP or 8MP mode.  The maximum (12 MP) gives the pictures a washed out sort of look.  I chose this camera primarily because it was so slim it could slip into your pocket and because it could take HD movies as well, and that it does!!!There are a few drawbacks, and that is that the battery life of this camera is not great, especially if you're shooting in video mode and the weather is somewhat cold.  I'm a huge outdoor enthusiasts and find that even with a spare battery I have to think twice about taking photos I want to take on multi-day treks.  I think the huge brightly lit LCD screen contributes to that a lot.  Another thing I found frustrating at times, but it's not too bad, is that you can't switch from picture to video mode in an instant.  Since it's touchscreen you have to pull up a menu and then switch.  Another thing is that low-light and night time photos look overexposed with the flash so I usually turn off the flash and try to keep it very still, but even so there's a lot of noise.The drawbacks, however, are overlooked considering the overall excellent pictures and video this thing takes.

I could use video stills to create pictures of her because she was just toooooo fast for the lens. It takes video and can record alot. I was able to make this camera an integral part of my lifestyle.

Of course you cannot compare it with a DSLR but it does the right/great job! Hint: to keep touchscreen safe, always make it facing your leg while carrying in a pocket.P.S.

Then, there is the underwater housing which is only the size of your average pocket camera.\"What can this midget do for me?\" ran through my subconscious.\"Try it,\" he said. \"Then bring me back some video so that I can do some store promotion.\"This was two years ago, he got his promotional DVD to show his customers and today I am still addicted to this tiny titan.Every weekday I shoot underwater videos and stills professionally as a SCUBA diver. I have used over two dozen cameras underwater of different company names and models. When I say that this is the best camera I have ever used for instant action underwater scenarios...believe me!It has the best automatic underwater white balancing for video and images that I have come across. Whatever magic Sony used, it accurately captures the vibrancy of underwater reds like no other. As any diver knows, the deeper you go, the less red is visible. This makes for interesting challenges as a manual red filter at 30 feet will not render the same red light recovery at 60, 90 or more feet under natural light conditions. (The underwater housing is good to a depth of 132 feet!) Changing filters underwater is impossible for most cameras and challenging, to say the least, for others. The 'Underwater Automatic White Balance' setting on the T90 seems to continually adapt to changing water conditions and renders reds as they should be.It can zoom while shooting video making for very intriguing, original and unique scenes and angles to grab and hold the viewers attention. I can zoom-in to tight frame on a subject, like the eye of a fish and zoom-out without stopping my recording to set the surrounding scene.How many cameras do you know of that can lock and hold focus on an object through 100 feet of water?The Sony Cybershot DSC-T90 can do it.It does so without focus wander or losing valuable time trying to lock on.Another great advantage of the T90's slim profile is that I can carry several spares in my diving vest's (BCD) pockets and still have room for other diving accessories.Why, you ask, would I want to have several cameras with me?There are a number of reasons. With two compact T90 cameras on a rack mount, I can shoot HD video (1080x720) with one while simultaneously taking 12.1 MP stills with the other. Using several cameras I can also film multiple angles at once. (You cannot shout \"Cut\" to a fish and retake the scene.) Should batteries run low (video is a power hog) or I fill up a flash card, I can grab another fully-charged camera without having to surface! (This is a big deal for SCUBA divers.) Additionally, (Heaven forbid) I make a mistake and flood a housing, I do not have to end my dive and lose picture sales for the day.Oh, yes...the camera gives me professional quality stills and videos by pressing just one button.Not having to fiddle around with a bunch of buttons and settings is crucial underwater. Fish are always in motion and scare easily to boot. If I do not have to fiddle with controls it means that I can capture a unique scene instantly. Plus, less hand and finger movement means that I am less likely to startle the fish.Did I mention that it is tiny? Very tiny. It is so tiny that fish rarely notice the camera. Anyone who has worked around fish know that they can get very uneasy about objects in a diver's hands. The bigger the object, the more likely a fish is to feel threatened. The T90 solves that problem by being almost unnoticeable. It is also small enough that it can be slipped inside crevices of coral without touching and damaging this delicate species.You may wonder about light handling capabilities. Have no fear. Even with such a tiny lens and aperture opening, this camera manages to have excellent light gathering ability. I have used it underwater on cloudy days and at night without dive lights to capture the subtle glow of plankton and other bio-luminescent life.The videos taken with this camera have allowed me to produce documentary DVDs, commercials and more. Post-editing videos to do color correction is an extremely time-consuming chore. I have rarely had to color correct T90 videos. With the sharpness of the imagery and the excellent contrast and color rendition, most people assume the videos were taken with a much larger and more expensive camera. They simply cannot believe me when I reach into my pocket and show them the T90.I totally recommend this powerhouse little tyke to anyone who ventures into Neptune's realm.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOt what I thought it was.......", "Author": "Cynanne", "ReviewID": "RAWEZVBFTP22Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in Dec, and now in March it is broken, I have been disappointed with the quality of the pictures that it takes and not the button that holds the battery in place is broken.

Yes, many Sony products are a little pricy as compared to other brands, but the quality certainly worth the bucks. I have never (yes, I say never) have had a problem with all the Sony products that I own so far.Well, back to the camera, as expected, the camera looks amazing, or, even betther than the images here. The metalic blue really makes the camera looking cool. The camera is slim and easy to carry. It is not as light as I expected, but it is actually a good thing; because if it is light weight, it may look cheap, and considering the material that it is made of, it is not supposed to be light anyway.Although I had doubts about touch screen at the beginning, it actually works pretty good. I was afraid that sometimes touch screen may not respond well and instant, but it actually reponded well; however, I have to use the touch pen every time, so it takes 1 or 2 extra seconds to select options as compared to old camers that you may know exactly where the buttons are and able to press them even without looking at the camera. This would be my only complain, but hey, when I take pictures, I do not use the touch screen that often, besides switching from auto-flash and turning off the flash.The quality of photos are amazing. When I went on a trip with friends, many of them were like \"wow, the pictures are really clear and beautiful\" when they use my camera, so I assume that is a neutral party confirmation of the product quality?! lol. Overall, I am impressed with the camera. Oh, forgot to mention the smile shutter function, it is super sweet and super cute. It may not be very useful, but it works very well when pictures are taken indoor and in a close position to the camera (it seems that it is a little hard for the camera to recognize or focus on people's faces when the sunlight is too strong or the distance is too far). Although I do not have a big family or kids, I do think this is a useful function when there is a party held at a house, you know, whenever you take pictures of just people.Anyway, I recommend this product to everyone. By the way, the battery life certainly improves a lot as compared to the older model that I purchased a couple years before, and as compared to other brands as well.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not Worth It", "Author": "HappyCow", "ReviewID": "R1U18HFQL1YYDI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is coming from a person who has owned this device for a few years now doesn't know squat about cameras. I read so many reveiws from photographic know-it-alls ranting off about specs when all I want is dumbed down English that tells me if this device takes good pictures or not. So for people like me I'll do just that in my review.Back in the day, I would've considered this to be a decent point-and-shoot (aka an I-don't-know-anything-about-cameras kind of camera) but these days not so much. The quality of the images are nice, the touch screen is great and it's very easy to use. Close-up STILL targets come out quite beautiful.On the downside, the largest disappointing feature is the Zoom function. 4x is NOTHING if you hope to capture moments from a distance (ie graduations, stage events, weddings in a big church). It also doesn't shoot very well at night. So don't take it to Las Vegas and expect to get a good picture of city lights or to a concert and expect to get any good closeups or facial features of whoever is playing. Motion images can be a problem no matter what you do so forget trying to take a clear picture of little Johnny on the soccer field.As for the camera itself, it's a sleek design with subtle contours that make holding onto easier but not bulky in your pocket. I've never had problems with the components breaking but I have accidently turned it on a few times when the cover slips. The battery life is weak. It drains even when the camera isn't on and the battery is out, so buy spares. Always keep one sitting in the charger ready to go. A fresh battery will last you a couple hours.Overall, I suggest spending a little more and getting a newer point-and-shoot model. For this price you can find something worth your money and with more features to play with. Remember, higher Zoom numbers means you can narrow in on things better from a distance (at the time of this review, numbers in the upper teens and beyond are worth your dollar). Higher megapixels refer to the quality of the image you get and this matters if you don't want to post fuzzy photos on the internet or even plan to fix them up in Photoshop later.

The punchline is simple. It is TINY, fits in my pocket like a cell phone (please remember not to have anything else in your pocket because the touchscreen WILL scratch), fast, and i haven't had to take it off AUTO to get the best pictures. Of course fooling around with black & white, sepia, and vibrant is fun, but 99% of the time, I leave it on auto and the pictures come out GREAT. This camera has a great quality of capturing backround light and creating a great picture by mixing the light sources together. Mind you i'm not a professional photographer, but if you were, you wouldn't be buying a non SLR camera anyway. The bottom line is that whenever i am at a party, my camera takes the best pictures compared to anyone elses pocket size digital camera, every time, PERIOD.

The two problems with this camera were 1.) Battery Life and 2.) Power On/Off Button. Maybe i'm not use to the touch screen idea of battery life, but when on vacation I noticed that I would have to recharge my battery atleast twice a day if I were to use consistently for a few hours. I'm kind of okay with that if there's a power outlet around to charge it! The next thing that makes me completely frustrated which also has effect on the first problem is the Power On/Off button. If you have the camera in the Sony camera case or if it's in your pocket (of course you don't want to simply put it in your pocket without covering in case it gets scratched or you bump into something that will dent it - it appears like a delicate camera), you run the chance of accidentally turning it on, which in my case would ALWAYS turn on when I tried to tuck it in my pocket. Then there were times I forgot when I turned it on, because I was on vacation more focused on touring different places, and wanted to take a picture and the camera would already read 'Low Battery.' It makes me frustrated to find a camera not usable when you've spent time charging it for a specific event. Those are two problems one should check out before this camera.However, the Positives of this camera, besides the portability, is the shutter speed, high quality movie and photo, editing of photos on camera, and other functions that make this camera somewhat a keeper.I just still get angered to see that I have to walk around with not only a camera case, but also a charger!", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love the form factor!", "Author": "ReviewerDave", "ReviewID": "R3QI8Q6HA3H9D0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my Sony DSLR with this because I rarely used the BIG DSLR camera. I wanted an ultra portable camera with great features without the hassle of \"preparing\" the camera for every shot I took. I love this camera for a lot of reasons: touch screen to configure and navigate, zoom lens works great without an actual lens that zooms in and out from the camera body, great build, super portable, and great battery life. There is a setting for almost anything you could think of. I wanted to have a camera that I could just pull it out and it would be able to auto adjust to ANY environment. That said, this camera takes great pictures, mostly outdoor pictures. With everything set to \"Auto\", outside pictures are great! Inside pictures, which normally need flash, are the worst I have ever seen from a Sony digital camera. Granted, I could get it to take good inside pictures if I made adjustments in various settings. But I wanted the Intelligent Auto exposure setting to do this for me. It just so happens to do that better when pics are taken outdoors rather than indoors.Also worth mentioning is video. I have taken a few videos and they turned out great! It records in 720p HD and the resolution and sound is great!So I gave it 4 stars, but I would have given it 3 1/2 stars. Many shots I take are indoors, probably more than 50%. Most of those pictures are ok when viewed on a PC screen or TV that is set to view the picture to fit the screen.

The touch screen is now the best part of this camera in my opinion. It comes with this little plastic pen that attaches to the wrist cord. If I'm editing the pictures or seriously messing with the settings I can use the pen, but if I'm just making small adjustments while shooting, a finger tip does very well.The volume could be a little louder on the camera during playback.

I was at a music club one night and shot video of the singer, and got a huge positive response to it, even from the performer.Nearly every concert video I have taken with this little camera has turned out flawless. The only two things keeping me from giving it 5 stars are: (1) The tiny microphone is located at the top of the camera in a place where I would naturally place my fingers to hold the camera, so if I forget and cover the mic, the audio gets muddled; and (2) the battery does not last more than about 40 minutes while shooting videos, but I suppose having a back-up battery handy would solve that.I could buy a fancier camera for my new video-taping hobby, but I don't know that the quality would be any better. I've had recording artists use my music videos for their promotion, and a media outlet used one for an Internet interview. So, if you like to shoot video, you may not need a separate flip or video camera. This little camera really gets the job done, and it's a slickly designed camera, too.

I am very pleased with the Sony interface... it's very friendly. Screen is touch, which is great and the size is pretty good. The Intelligent Auto Adjustment and Scene Recognition features are just great. It can automatically take an additional picture under special conditions with different settings to try to get the best picture possible. It records movie at 1280x720 (HD) in MP4 format.

Amazon shipped the camera promptly and all was well.Upon opening the box, there is a printed message that states \" do not contact the Seller if you are experiencing trouble with this product\". I know from previous experiences THAT IS NEVER A GOOD SIGN!Shrugging off that ominous message, I put an 8Gb Memory Stick Duo card in the device. I got a message to \"re-insert memory card\". I tried inserting other compatible memory cards and the only one that worked is a 2GB card. I went to Sony's website signed up for a chat session with their digital camera guys and got the bad news the camera has to be returned to Sony for service! No way was I going to return a brand new product to any manufacturer for service. I notified Amazon of my issues and they promptly sent me a new replacement Sony DSC T90.Upon getting the new replacement camera, I installed a 8GG memory stick duo and got the message \"re-insert memory card\"!

We were trying to decide between the 290 and 90. The T90 had amazing video compared to the older sony that we had. Outdoor photos are very crisp and have great color. It is a small camera so it was very easy to take it anywhere, however, very few photos that we take indoors in medium light situations are clear. There is a lot of blurr (yes, I read the manual and tried every possible setting), which outweighs the convenience of this camera. In addition, it seemed like we were always charging the battery. The battery life is very poor and the indicator somewhat inaccurate. After having this camera for about 8 months and gravitating back to our old camera, we got the W290. I would not recommend the T90 if most of your photos will be indoors and especially if they are indoor candid photos of children. I would recommend if you are a camper and need a lightweight camera for you landscape shots, but don't take any movies on your trip, which seems to really suck out the battery power.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!", "Author": "Neomentat", "ReviewID": "R1U66RANTD3CV7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my X-mas trip to Vegas with the family.
