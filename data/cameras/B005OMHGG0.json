I am very happy with the camera and the other items that came with the kit.  The camera was very simple to figure out without even looking at the instructions.  I found the pictures to be very clear and the focus to be exact.  I think the picture quality is outstanding.  The camera is very light and easy to manipulate.  the self portrait option is very nice for getting a group shot with friends and not call someone else to take the shot.  I recommend this camera very hardily to anyone that wants a good camera that is easy to use, and takes outstanding pictures.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review of Samsung MV800", "Author": "stemar", "ReviewID": "R15JKD103ACMNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initial opinion after 1 month's usage is:1.

If it works.", "Author": "david h.", "ReviewID": "R1JMD9SOSP5WF4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to get my camera and play with the plethora of functions and filters this super compact holds. there is definitely no shortage of things to learn with this camera. It is very lightweight and feels thin like if you drop it--that's gonna be it, it's over after that. Both the front and back LCD screens come in crystal clear with good color. I just wish it was touch screen rather than have to play with the tiny control pad and microscopic buttons it offers. I got to about picture #20 when the zoom/lens got stuck halfway out and open and wouldn't retract or fully extend. It was jammed!!  I was lucky I had registered it online first thing because samsung makes it no easy task to make the exception of repairing it. And while troubleshooting a remedy I was disappointed to find several other \"expected\" symptoms and issues with this camera .  Hopefully this will be the only problem this camera brings. As for the extras this bundle comes with I'm really not impressed. The camera case is oversized, generic, and very cheap material that is very ugly and almost embarrassing to put my camera in and take it in public. The tripod might as well be made of flexy staws because it can barely handle the 3.6oz camera without tipping or moving. Highly unstable. I haven't even opened the lens cleaning kit so I cannot comment on that. But the camera's wide variety of functions and ease of use still makes it worth it to me to hang on to. It's very user friendly and is definitely a \"smart\"camera. Being that the camera has been in repair longer than it has been in my possession I give it 3*.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "the little camera that could?", "Author": "Emmett", "ReviewID": "R1N2VUPPBWZOC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow outstanding little camera for the price now. I'm a contractor stationed oversea and I love all the special effects this camera brings to the table. It's like having you own little photo-mart. Plus having the ability to take photo of myself. It small, lightweight and structured nicely. I took some photos of my co-worker and they where amazed. One friend is even buying his wife one.. Plus if you really need to see demo go on to YOUTUBE and you will be please with all the option this camera has.

The package has all the essentials too. Bit pricey but guess thats what u pay for design.I was happy to see that they added additional battery in it (the picture didn't have that so I was pleasantly surprised)The only bad thing is that the delievery took 11days. Yes, nearly 2 weeks. So considering the time value of the money, I had to take that 1 star off. Will update once I start actually using the camera.-------update------okay, here is the update since i've played with it a little more.there were several functions that i really liked. Like there is one mode which allows u to take picture of yourself. this was made really convenient cuz when u flip it open, u can kinda put it on like a desk or something n it will stay upright. Then all u gotta do is tap the screen, it will give 1,2,3 seconds with beep sounds take the photo. so ur hands r all free! The most amazing function was correcting ur skin blemishes. U can either use the beauty mode, or after taking the picture, go to the edit mode and correct it. Its so simple n as long as u took the photo enabling the camera to detect that its a human face, u can edit ur skin to be nearly flawless, even tone.so far love it. oh btw, i had been researching this camera on Korean websites for reviews (u guys all know samsung is korean brand right? :D) n there has been some complaints about photo quality not being awesome compared to other products like canon's. N i agree. If u really want the best quality, i think canon might b better choice. But the compliments I get about this unique product is just too enjoyable!any question regarding samsung mv800 is welcome~", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera was an AMAZING buy!", "Author": "Jesse Cabanes", "ReviewID": "R1KOBAOEGJMUOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came as a bundle and I just cannot believe how fantastic this device is!

I had a customer service issue with Beach Camera that did not go well at first but then eventually someone at Beach applied some common sense and made the issue right. Because of that, I went from originally wanting to give Beach 1 star to giving them 4 stars. If the customer service issue had gone like it should from the get-go, I would have given them 5 stars. Be warned and be careful buying something that states, \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" and then finding  out that the dealer used by Amazon to fill this order may or may not deal with customer service issues. They just may want only their money and if there's any problems, too bad if it's hard to resolve. Look at all the different dealers offers, find out if your buying directly from Beach Camera or any other dealer, or not, then be careful buying something that says, \"Fulfilled by Amazon.\"", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Bad Experience", "Author": "Anil", "ReviewID": "R2XEL6T5I685TD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have ordered the red colored item and saved my cart and ordered on other day, when it delivered i got Black one.Very late delivery, wrong memory card which does not work, no card reader shipped with this order, lot of things with one order itself.Very disappointed after i opened up the box.
