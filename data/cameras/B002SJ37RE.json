For Christmas I had purchased a Nikon Coolpix s203 thinking that I needed a change. Long story short, I took the camera back to Target and exchanged it for this one. Everything about this camera is spectacular. Regardless if you're an experinced photographer or brand new this camera is for you. Gone are the days of changing the settings, this camera does it automatically for you. Of course if you want to do it yourself you still have that option. The image quality on the camera's screen is very clear, and the photos come out amazingly too. I haven't had a change to mess with the video on the camera yet but from what the box says it makes it easy to put on Youtube. It's very easy to use and I love everything about this camera.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3S017OROG8S7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a photographer at heart, and I got my first camera when I was about 5 or so. This is my third camera. I got a Flip camera for Christmas but replaced it with this one. I love it! It is so skinny and small... and it was so cheap too! I had enough money left to buy a case, and then a little more! It is really easy to work. In my old camera, you used to have to take out the batteries and charge them for like a day and a half, but I love how you can just plug this one into the wall. It is really easy to work... I don't have any difficulties.

I absolutely love the fact that the camera can detect the type of picture it's going to be when you focus the picture. For example, before I take the picture it automatically says that the picture is a portrait, landscape, etc. So, even if you are an idiot you can still take good pictures. I really recommend this camera. Kodak never fails to impress me.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Brandi Nicole Gray", "ReviewID": "R3KBC649T9PPRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera exceeded my expectations.

This camera fit all of my needs just fine.  It's intuitive to use and relatively customizable.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a memory card, and the internal memory only has enough room for about ten high resolution photos. Otherwise this is a great little camera that takes amazing pictures, decent video, and is easy to work with.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed, product only worked for three months", "Author": "Boudica's Sword", "ReviewID": "R38EOG1FC9WF7Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in May for casual family photography. I have only used it on five different occasions to film my daughter riding her horse and one vacation trip. Now, even after replacing the battery twice and charging it overnight many times, the lenses refuses to stay extended The charger light indicates the camera is fully charged but the lense will not operate. I am very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately, my return-option period ended in June so now I am looking for a new camera. It will not be this brand. If I could give it 1/2 star I would.

The quality is like no other in its price range.  Great for everyday picture taking. Only problem I had was it wouldn't charge right.  The charger that came with it didn't seem to fit correctly.  Then, one day, it just wouldn't go in.  I wiggled it in finally and f---ed something up because after that, it wouldn't charge.  My advice is if the charger doesn't work RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY.

I have had the product for a year now with NO problems. There is even a \"smart\" picture function that takes the perfect picture every time. Years ago I purchased a digital camera for $500. It was big and tended to take 4 pictures and then it needed another 6 batteries. I hated it and swore off digital cameras.

I'm talking about taking a still shot while standing perfectly still.  I'm not a shaky person so I don't think it's just me. It also doesn't do well in anything but good, bright lighting.

My husband bought an 8G card so he could take a lot of movies of steam trains during a recent trip.  I don't recommend it, though, because I messed up my card reader trying to get it to work.

The camera hadn't been dropped or exposed to water, it didn't have a scratch on it and it was barely used.I contacted the seller to see if he/she would replace the camera or at least offer me a discounted replacement since I had it for a matter of a handful of weeks.  No dice.  I got a one sentence reply telling me to contact Kodak.  So much for customer service.
