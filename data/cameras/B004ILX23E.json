{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointed with the shipping and handling of the order", "Author": "Madhu", "ReviewID": "R216Q17XEKZGVA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received the package shipped from the seller without the lens; they sent it next day after contacting them.The lens was in a white box without the manuals creating doubts if it was a used product. The camera had all the accessories attached to it Eyepiece cap, rubber eyecup, lcd monitor cover etc. I don't know if they come detached with a new piece or it is this way.The memory cards included were also clearly used. I returned back the bundle after contacting the seller paying additional amount to the carrier to safely package it to be returned in pristine condition. I requested for a complete refund however received partial refund. I raised an A-Z claim and waiting to see what comes out. There was no reason as to why only partial amount was refunded. I am extremely disappointed with the way this order was handled, shipped and processed. I felt like the seller had no respect to the buyer.The Camera itself is a great product and I am going to walk in to a store and buy it again directly. The whole chaos lasted for a week and still counting.I had shipped a lens from Amazon directly and was very satisfied with the product, however when it comes to third party sellers, it is a different story all together. This will become a deal breaker for me going forward when shopping at Amazon.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004ILX23E"}}
