This was not the case, and the technician at the third-party seller (Spy Store) was unable to help me and promised to \"get back to me\"  This did not happen, and in the meantime the store's 14 day return policy took effect and I was informed I could no longer return it.  This is very disappointing.I have always had great success with items ordered from Amazon, except occasionally with third-party sellers.  I will no longer order anything from such sources.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8GB\n40min/GB\n1280x960", "Name": "BUSH BABY2 Hidden Camera Fan DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31FC2f8vHmL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0052U8DXY"}}
