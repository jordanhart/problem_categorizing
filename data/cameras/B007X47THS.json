I love the new upgrade to digital and video for all the obvious reasons.  I've been pleasantly surprised to find how user friendly and light the D3200 is. A distinct advantage for travelers. I'm still working my way through all the manual setting options (not hard, just limited time on my part), but the automatic is point and shoot ready.  Nikon's easy lense exchange is terrific as always.  Cameeta Camera put together a super package.  Everything came quickly, brand new and in perfect condition.  The lenses are very good for general use. D3200 comes with installed flash and red eye, but not a separate hot foot flash for bouncing light.  These two lenses will do everything I need from kid sports to hiking the Rockies.  Camera bag is heavy duty and durable for storage or car travel, but a bit bulky for air travel.  The close up lenses came in handy for school science project displays.  Great deal!", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic deal with great service!!", "Author": "Isabelle Lohrke", "ReviewID": "R33EARXYJPYY3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my camera and I absolutely love it!!
