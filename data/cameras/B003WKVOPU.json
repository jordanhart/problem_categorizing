{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Scanner the negatives is frustrating -- poor instructions", "Author": "David McAllister", "ReviewID": "R17K0EZQE80WNH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a very frustrating time trying to scan the negatives from the Spinner 360, but eventually got on top of it.  Not every modern backlit scanner works, as Lomography would have it, but the backlit Epson Perfection ones do (and only the backlit ones).  Some effort is needed to figure out how to align the film mask to the scanner backlit panel.  Lomography says you can get the printing done at a photo lab, but I found this service is not offered in my middle-sized American city.  Getting the negatives developed without cutting the strips was no problem, however.The Lomography company needs to provide a conspicuous link to the list of scanners that will work, and clear instructions on how to load the scanner and produce the jpeg files.  I nearly lost my mind, questioning whether it was even possible to do with the scanner I bought.  Their Customer Service could have been more helpful.  The customer service at Epson had no idea of what I was talking about when I mentioned Lomography's DigitaLiza film mask.Once you get it going it really is a lot of fun, and the pictures will be great to share with friends and family included in them.  The camera is easy to use.  The colors in the photos are a little funky, but that's part of the fun, plus you can intensify them or touch them up digitally once they're scanned.Be ready to buy a scanner and to devote a lot of effort to the scanning process if you can't find a lab that will do it in your town.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "thumbs up", "Author": "Billy D", "ReviewID": "R2RSBCLEDI5Z1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "my camera just arrived on time as expected.
