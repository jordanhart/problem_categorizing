{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far - PERFECT!", "Author": "FlatPicker", "ReviewID": "R2DRH1468OI0X6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to agree with the other 5-star reviewers.This is one product that is in very good taste and works perfectly every time.  The image quality is absolutely perfect.The auto-focus is right on the money every time.  Note that the older models of Pentax cameras did not have a perfect auto-focus.  For instance, I still have my Pentax K10D.  The manual for the Pentax K10D explains that the auto-focus is not always perfect, which is true.  On the other hand, the Pentax K-5 II is advertised to have a much improved auto-focus, which turns out to be absolutely true.  But the auto-focus in the Pentax K-5 II turned out to be even BETTER than I expected.For all those who might want to know, this Pentax K-5 II camera seems smaller and lighter than the older models, such as the Pentax K10D.  This kind of surprised me.Here is something else that I don't dare forget to mention:  I bought a  Metz mecablitz 58 AF-2 Digital Flash and it works perfectly with the Pentax K-5 II camera.  I bought both the camera and the flash unit very recently through Amazon.  You should check out the flash unit as well as the camera.  I'm having perfect results with the flash unit as well as with the camera.Something else I should mention is that the lens that comes with this kit is very good.  If I'm not mistaken, this same lens can cost a few hundred dollars if bought separately.  These kits also come with an 18-55 zoom lens, but those lenses are much less expensive and aren't as nice as this one.For those who want to know, this lens has good friction on the manual focus ring and the manual focus ring will slip as necessary (in a very good quality way) when the focal limits are reached in either direction.  There is just about the right amount of friction when zooming too.  These controls and the lens itself have a nice precise \"tight\" feeling.  The lens even comes with a beautiful lens cap.  The lens seems to focus perfectly at all focal lengths.According to what I've experienced so far, I would highly recommend buying this camera and lens.Here is an update on 11/13/13:  I had tried using the camera to do some videos and found that to be difficult.  The problem is mostly that the autofocus doesn't work for videos.  But the image quality  in the videos looked like it might be pretty good if the video were produced under the right conditions.  What I discovered is that if the subject is well-lit and stays pretty much in the same place (so that the focus stays pretty much the same), then the video will probably turned out pretty well.I set the aperture at f8 (it was possible to go to a slightly smaller aperture, but that would have been borderline for what I was doing) and focused on a spot under an LED lamp.  Then I placed several different objects under the light in the area that was in focus.  The camera was mounted in a tripod.  The videos turned out to be much better than any that I had seen online.I was using the HD 30 setting for image quality.  To get to this setting, press the menu button to get to the first menu.  Then press the right navigator button until you get to the fourth page of the menu.  The item at the top of page 4 is \"MOVIE\".  Press the down navigator button one time to select \"MOVIE\" and then press the right navigator button and that will show which video resolution is selected.  To change the resolution, press the right navigator button again and that will take you to another menu.  There are 5 resolutions to choose from.  When you play your video back and you are using a fairly high resolution, I would suggest playing it on the Windows Media Player at full screen resolution.My conclusion is that if you use a small aperture, tripod and bright enough light, you can make a very good video.  The small aperture setting allows more depth of field, and if the subject stays pretty much in the same place, then focus shouldn't be a problem like it normally would.  However, if you are buying a product that will be used primarily for video, then you should buy a good video recorder instead.  The K-5 II is still a fantastic camera, even without the ability to do videos.  I haven't found anything that I don't like about it.  One other thing about making videos is that you might want to record your sound using a better microphone than the built-in camera microphone.Update, 01/26/14: I did an experiment recently that I really want to tell people about.  I bought this camera with a Metz mecablitz 58 AF-2 Digital Flash for Pentax Cameras.  As far as I have been able to tell, the flash is as excellent as the camera itself.I attached the flash to my Pentax K-5II camera and then went into my bedroom, which was pitch dark.  It was so dark that I couldn't even see the walls in my bedroom.  Then I started taking pictures in total dark.  The only thing I could see were a little bit of the subjects against an opposite wall when the camera used the green light to help with auto-focus.  I took several pictures in the total dark.  When I got done and checked the pictures, all of them had perfect exposure!  I think this speaks highly of both the camera and the flash.  Right now I'm right on the verge of buying a second camera and flash like the ones I just bought.  That's how satisfied I am with both products.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, amazing quality.", "Author": "Carlos den Hartog", "ReviewID": "R3EYNNBOLR3T2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had Nikon cameras for 30 years, but decided to give a chance to Pentax (1975 Pentax KX was my first SLR). I do not regret at all. I have already taken around a thousand pictures and the image quality is amazing. The camera is terrific: perfect weight, great viewfinder, excellent AF and controls are easy to understand and to get accustomed to. The 18-135 Zoom is very good, kind of a perfect walk-around lens for the K5 II, tough it has showed some CA (purple fringe) in a few pictures.The build quality of the camera and of the lens is really impressive - old-Pentax style: I still have my Pentax KX (1975), and tough I have not used it for years, it still works fine. Build like a tank! And my old Non-AF Pentax lenses work on the K-5 II...If you are not bound to Nikon or Canon or Sony, etc., because of lenses and other related equipments, and want to move to a new DSLR, build with quality (not plastic...) for a reasonable price,  I do suggest you to try the Pentax K-5 II.

Martin", "ReviewID": "R24BS0KYFETJKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Pentax K200D for the last few years and I have really enjoyed it.  My only real complaint about the K200D was the fact that the ISO would only go to 1600.  I take a lot of pictures in situations where I really don't want to use a flash and the performance at ISO 1600 was not always good enough.  Every time a new Pentax camera has come out I have considered if it's a worthy upgrade.  I really liked that K200D was weather proof, and that I could use older (Pentax K-mount) lenses on the K200D so I wanted those features in any upgrade I chose.I'd say that the performance of this camera at ISO 3200 is similar to the K200D in terms of the noise in the image - and it can go up MUCH higher.  I can put it in TAV mode, set it at 1/60th sec shutter speed, pick an F-stop, and how high I'm willing to let the ISO go and shoot away.  The noise can be significant at 3200 and above (see examples online) but for me it's better than a flash in many situations.  I've been using Lightroom as the next step in my workflow and the noise filtering in Lightroom 4 is really pretty good so I generally let the camera go up to 6400 if it wants too - it almost never goes that high.Two other things I love about this camera: 1) The autofocus is REALLY fast, even in low-light situations.  2) The build quality is so good - it's REALLY solid in your hands.  To me it feels even better than the K200D did.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best of the best!", "Author": "Mclavilla", "ReviewID": "R8N46TZLUHM4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unbelievable camera.What else I would say?The Pentax K-5ii is significantly more compact than similar Nikon and Canon cameras while offering more options and features.

The camera is built well, has a very nice sturdy feel to it and isn't too heavy using the 18-135 WR lens it came with.  IQ is great, button layout just makes a lot of sense and the camera is just a pleasure to shoot with.  Menu tabs are extremely easy to navigate and it's so very easy to switch settings on the fly, taking only a couple seconds to change pretty much anything once you are familiar with the camera.  Have taken great night photos with very little noise all the way up to ISO 1600, the weather resistance also works very well on both the body and 18-135 WR lens.  I've been caught out in some hard rain a few times already and the camera with WR lens mounted functioned perfectly while getting soaked in the rain, and still no sign of ill effects.Only minor disappointment with the lens, but they were expected.  The 18-135mm f3.5 isn't particularly good for low light indoor photos of moving subjects w/o a flash, but that's what we have faster primes for anyway.  Would be nice if the focus ring was marked, kinda hard to focus to infinity in the dark without being able to see the setting on the ring.  Outdoors it's taken great landscape photos in low light and even works well for the bit of astrophotography I've tried.Overall very satisfied with this purchase and will be happily taking photos until the camera gives out =D.

BUT, the pictures we have taken with it so far are incredible and we love being able to just shoot pictures in rapid fire succession - beautiful.

However, it was not really capable of all of the things that I wanted to be able to do with it.  Night shots were definitely in the \"so-so\" category.Many years ago I had a Pentax film camera that I loved until it was stolen.  So, when this camera became available with such a wide range lens, I just had to give it a try.Here is what I like about it:  1.  If you just want to start taking pictures and are not quite ready to start changing settings, set the camera to the auto mode and you will be MORE than pleased with the results.  This camera far outperforms my prior Nikon in the auto mode.  Of course, this is a much more expensive camera, but it is nice that you can just start using it have great results!  2.  Flexibility!  This camera is capable of just about anything that you want of it.  The settings are easy to work with and the symbols actually make sense.  3.  Contrary to some comments, the included kit lens does a GREAT job!  The zoom is very smooth and the auto focus is quick and precise.  I have taken several macro shots (2 feet) with max zoom and the clarity is superb!  (keep in mind that you need to use a tripod if you want clarity with this type of picture).  4.  The camera has a very nice feel to it and is very solid and does not feel plastic like.  The comparable Nikon and Cannon camera felt very inexpensively built compared to this camera.  I can very easily one hand this camera without issues.  5.  The 16.3 MP camera delivers very nice pictures with plenty of ability to crop to be able to come out with a fantastic shot.  6.  The battery lasts a VERY long time!  I have taken over 800 pictures and not had to replace the battery.What I did not like:  1.  The included software is only certified for Windows 7.  When I contacted Pentax, they seemed puzzled as to why I would want to have the software certified for Windows 8 64 bit OS.  Guess it really does not matter since I have not used their software and have not had any issues with my current software (Photoshop and Corel).  2.  The Pentax support people did not think that anyone would want to connect their camera to an IPAD and as such stated that it was not supported.  For the record, it works just great with my current generation Ipad and the Ipad mini.  Makes it very easy in the field to tell what type of shots you really took.  Just use the lightening to USB connector to connect to your camera cable and download the pictures.  Great while in the field to ensure your camera stays water tight and dirt free.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera and the Pentax support folks were quick to respond, even if they seem a bit in the dark about using something other than a computer to work with pictures.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a entry to mid level digital SLR.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Uri", "ReviewID": "R38TLHD7EEQEA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As many have noted before, this is a great camera for the enthusiast, outdoor-oriented photographer.I've owned it for a few months now (it replaced the Nikon D-80 I owned, which I've had quite a few issues with).I've taken it in the snow, in the sun, took closeups, panoramic and action pics with it, and I'm very pleased with the results.Controls are easy to find and handle, screen interface is intuitive and the ergonomics and image quality are great.Knowing this camera can handle the elements is also a big plus for me as I'm quite demanding on equipment in this respect.It is also compact (though not necessarily light) compared with its peers, which is, again, a plus for the outdoors/travel oriented user.On the down side (which I've known in advance but still wish for) are:1. Lack of a double SD slot (which could have been very useful as it would have allowed storing jpg images on a WiFi SD card and RAW on a higher-capacity standard card - this has been added in the newer K-3).2. Lack of tilting screen for taking shots at difficult angels.3.

I did a lot of research as to which camera to buy. I compared Nikon, Olympus (my previous camera brand), Canon, full frame vs crop sensor, two lens kit vs one lens kit, etc. Nothing came close to this camera with this lens in performance or price. I'll keep it simple:Why buy this camera?1. Weather resistance. Type in K-5ii Weather on YouTube and be amazed at people taking pictures in the rain with this camera. I mean, literally in the rain or the sand with no garbage bag or $200 camera jacket, taking pictures.2. Wide angle telephoto lens. This lens is bucks if bought separately. It is much better than having to switch lenses during your shoot. It will basically stay attached to your camera unless doing some specialized shots. There is some very minor distortion at the 18mm focal length but this is hardly noticeable and easily corrected.3. This camera is built like a tank and performs like a fine tuned piece of equipment that it is. It is a little heavier than I expected but it grips really well and my wife didn't mind the weight when taking pictures.4. The menu system is deep, however, easy to use.5. Performance. This is the perfect go to camera for all type of shooting with no concern for weather, battery life (900 shots I believe), photo quality. The 16mp sensor might concern some, but unless you're printing shots greater than 3ft long, I wouldn't sweat it.What else to buy with this camera:1. The smc DA 50mm f1.8 lens. While not weather resistant (only DA* or WR are weather resistant), it is a good prime lens for under $200 that works for portraits and night shots.2. The Promaster SystemPro 62mm White Balance Cap. Great for white balancing and only $11.99 here.3. Flashair SD card, great for transferring files even if you're in adverse weather. You won't have to open up the camera to connect the cable or remove the SD card.4. The Pentax 2 year extended warranty card (must be purchased within 30 days of camera purchase according to Pentax). It costs about $20 or a little less at sites out there. I cannot find it on Amazon. At less than $1 a month, this is a good deal.5. A tripod. I bought the Pedco Ultrapod II, works great and fits in my pocket. I can attach it to a lot of things. $16.80 on Amazon.6. The Opteka CSLR-50 neoprene case wraps this camera very nice. Every time I leave the house I take the camera with the 18-135mm lens in this and that's all. $12.95 on Amazon.Why NOT buy this camera?If you're concerned about being made fun of for buying a camera that in my opinion outperforms any camera in it's price range but doesn't have the name Nikon or Canon on it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "dan b", "ReviewID": "RQTV04R1C8OGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera came in original Pentax packaging with correct accessories.

I have bought a lot of merchandise from Amazon over the years but I was very leery of buying a camera from them based on the many, and some scathing, negative reviews I have read on camera forums and seller ratings websites regarding three of the prominent third party vendors selling cameras on Amazon, (not Adorama or Amazon.com LLC btw). I was concerned about gray market, refurbished, kit break-downs, used and who knows what else unwarrantable cameras being sold as new. Though this has nothing to do with Amazon, Pentax customer service told me they will not warrant any product bought using PayPal. I'm filling in the blanks, but I imagine this is because of the garbage being sold on Ebay, where the three suspect Amazon vendors thrive. I suggest anyone considering investing in any brand digital camera costing this kind of money do themselves a favor and research and investigate the vendor they are purchasing from.
