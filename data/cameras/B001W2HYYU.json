No complaints for basic use in that regard.  I just use it to take pictures of my students and whenever I go out with friends.However, it's a pain in the neck transferring pictures because I usually get an error message that says \"USB error.\" It takes several tries of plugging and unplugging the USB cord before it connects on my home computer (which is about 5 years old). On my new computer at work, however, I usually don't have that problem (though it doesn't work on the really old student computers either).So if your computer is more than a year or two old, expect problems with the computer connection. You might want to fork over 15 or 20 more dollars for a better quality camera.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera!", "Author": "Michael Davisson", "ReviewID": "R1YKIDPR0I3891", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been trying to find a cheap but good digital camera for a while now. I saw this one in the store. It works great has a lot of features. Though it takes a little getting used to its a charm. I did get a usb error the first time I plugged it in but the cord was loose thats all.The downside is its internal memory is very very small. only held 2-4 pics. Though an SD card is pretty cheap so its not a problem. Also the resolution settings are confusing, most cameras (the ones i've used at least in the past) have the pixel resolution like 640x480 ect. This one though uses one word settings, and the tiny manual doesnt explain what size each are equal too.I've yet to see how it fares battery wise, but I imagine its the same as most cameras out there.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect little digital camera", "Author": "M.

Russo", "ReviewID": "R2N9D9DP9ZZBDZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think the aggressive title of this review sums it all up.  The only great thing about this camera is I didn't buy it at Amazon.  I purchased it from Best Buy.  It was on sale, and I was with someone else that said it was a real bargain for just under $100.00.  I typically -never- buy anything that appears to be a \"great bargain\" but I slipped, and took some advice, which is ultimately my own fault.  As for the camera, where do I start?  Many of the reviews on the Best Buy site state that the battery life is next to nothing.  That is certainly true.  As for the photo quality, I really cannot comment on it, being that I have --yet-- to find a way to upload the photos to my Windows XP platform computer.  I couldn't build the NASA space shuttle from scratch, but I know quite a bit about computers, software, and the in and out of some of what I call \"Windows Trickery\" in terms of funny behavior, etc.  I wanted to first make sure the software problem wasn't on my end, so I used a fetal version of Windows XP.  I have a version of Windows XP with only MS Office on it, and a connection to the internet...so suffice to say, the software issue of this camera not being recognized is not on my end.  According to the specs, it is Windows XP compatible, although I beg to differ.Here's what happens:You are supposed to plug in your device, turn on your machine, and Windows XP finds it.  Well it does \"sometimes.\"  I plugged the camera in and turned on my machine a total of 10 times.  Out of the 10 times I did this, it found the camera twice.  Out of those two times, it comes up as a 'removable drive' (similar to what happens when you use a flashdrive).  Of the two times it came up, during one time it \"disappeared\" and was no longer recognized, in under two minutes.  I did not move the camera around, and my USB connection was steady and not tampered with.  The other time it was recognized for a few seconds, then disappeared, then nothing.More Issues:1.  THE SOFTWARE/INCLUDED DISC DOESN'T WORK.  The camera comes with a 3\" disc (CD ROM).  It contains PDF files that are an owners' manual.  However, the disc comes up with errors when you try to read it.  Not a problem for me... I spent about 25 minutes online and found a manual for this camera, and on page 16, it tells you how to connect to your computer, and even gives you troubleshooting pointers... But as with most \"troubleshooting\" it's just (what I call) \"documented common sense.\"  Check the batteries, etc.  All this I have done.  The connections are firm, the batteries are new (2 AA's) out of the box.  I even tried both types of AA batteries, metal hyd' and alk', and it makes no difference--same behavior.  I've tried this disc on another computer, and the same result occurs.  Are there drivers on the disc?  Nope.  Does it require drivers?  I would have to -assume- not because the manual (later found) doesn't mention them, but it also fails to tell you they are -not- needed, so for those of us \"plug n' play non-believers\" we are left in the dark to resort to trial (and error) of the product.2.  THE USB CONNECTION CORD IS PROPRIETARY.  The cord that connects the camera to your USB 2.0 port is proprietary.  It has a typical rectangular end that connects to your USB outlet port on your machine.  Sometimes computers have USB connections on the front under the ROM drives, and some on the back.  The end that plugs into the camera is a smaller, seldom used type of connector...  one of which you cannot easily find to replace, and would have to special order from perhaps Tiger Software, even if they have it.3.  THE USB CONNECTION CORD IS BARELY TWO FEET LONG.  If your computer is a tower and not on your actual desk, you're screwed.  I'm old fashioned, I don't use a laptop, so maybe if you have a laptop, it's possible.  Point is, it's ridiculously a short cord compared to other computer components--and you cannot easily get an extension for it because it's proprietary (see my last paragraph above).4.  THE USB CONNECTION PORT ON THE ACTUAL CAMERA IS POORLY DESIGNED.  There is a small, rubber flap that you have to lift up to plug in the USB cord connection, and it's almost impossible to fully lift up enough to get the connection in.  Imagine an outdoor electrical socket with a lifting cap on it...now imagine that that cap doesn't lift up all the way--you cannot get a solid connection.  I nearly broke the thing off to get a solid connection to eliminate that issue from the equation of why this camera doesn't work...and I almost broke it off... which doesn't matter now, since the camera is useless.5.  THE CAMERA WON'T STAY ON WHEN YOU CONNECT TO YOUR COMPUTER.  I've read many other reviews about this same issue, so I'm verifying it--no new news here. According to the manual on page 16, it tells you \"When you connect, if the camera goes \"dormant\" to save on battery life, press any other button except the power button to make sure it's on.  Well, that doesn't work--it doesn't respond.  I've tried systematically turning it on, plugging it in, turning the computer on and running through more tests, and pressing other buttons DOES NOTHING.  The only button you can press to verify it's on is the power button...and sometimes that would cause it to shut off (because it was dormant, but actually on!) and other times, it turned off by itself, and hitting the power button alerted you to the fact it was off because it turned on and the lens popped out again.  What a fine mess and a complete F*** job for someone who just wants to get his photos off this thing, even with above average computer experience.  I really feel bad for anyone who has this camera and has barely any computer experience, they will pull their hair out.6.  A NOTE ABOUT USB PORTS.  Most people don't know that on some desktop/tower computers, there is a difference between the USB ports in front (under the ROM drives) and in back of the machine.  Not always, but sometimes, the USB ports in front are only \"HUB\" ports, and will not work with individual components like a camera, scanner, etc.  My ports in front are hub ports, but I tried testing this camera on both front and back ports just to eliminate more variables from the equation, and it works on neither.7.  THE CAMERA CASE DESIGNATED FOR THE CAMERA DOESN'T FIT THE CAMERA! (YEAH, SERIOUSLY).  Again, I must make it clear I'm not slamming Amazon.  I've ordered DVD's and CD's from Amazon, as well as second hand resellers that list on Amazon...and in the years I have been purchasing, I've never had a bad experience.  I've never had issues or anything else, and delivery was always prompt.  I purchased this camera at Best Buy, and there was a package deal to get a case with the camera.  Well, the case that was listed to go with the camera DOESN'T FIT the camera!  Now, you ask, well didn't you put the camera IN the case BEFORE you bought it?  No, I did not.  For two reasons... it's common sense to assume they are selling you the right case with the camera since it was on the sale sign and merchandise POP banner in the store.  Secondly, I never assume...and since I did, I knew that if by some chance the case was wrong, I could return it.  Well, that's exactly what I ended up doing--and getting another one.  Of all things.8.  AND NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN---THE DIAMOND!  (BUT IT'S GUARDED BY A KING COBRA SNAKE).  So, at this point I decided to cut my losses and future aggrevation and mental derangement accquired from my frustration with this product---and I pulled the storage chip out and gave it to someone with a completely different camera to get the few pics I had taken off of it.  After doing so, I was able to view the pictures on another computer after being loaded by another camera--and they are stunningly beautiful.  It just makes me want to cry--there the diamond is, but the practicality of this piece of s*** camera makes it a diamond that you can not easily get to--hence my little cobra analogy.Now there is something called a \"card reader\" that you can actually take the card out of the camera and put the card into...and that card reader is either a part of your comptuer tower, or you can purchase it separately.  I prefer not to have to plug the actual camera in and go through all this--it's much easier to access the storage medium directly (in my humble view)... However, based on the experience with this camera on a Windows XP platform on a computer less than two years old, I strongly suspect there would be similar issues with the reader if it was from the INSIGNIA company.  I'm not risking my sanity to find out.  I'll either dump the camera, or purchase another card reader and hold onto the camera for at least another year to get some worth out of what I have already toileted on my expense.  $90.00 isn't the end of the world, but it's just the feeling of being ripped off that irks me.  So INSIGNIA can really go kiss mine for this one.  Sorry guys, but your product sucks.Should I call tech' support?  Should I go to their website and try all the \"troubleshooting\" and \"fixes\"?  Yes, I could.  But why should I?  I also don't want to call tech support and speak to someone outside the United States, or wait on hold for an hour, or have to \"pay\" for \"premium support\" (another huge GAME)... So screw it!Seriously now, you have to know when to cut your losses.  The amount of time invested, and the frustration no longer becomes worth the effort of the goal, and this isn't a huge priority since I can easily go and purchase a superior product for a little more dollar.  I type very fast, so I am hoping someone else out there will in fact benefit from this \"rant-view.\"  Time is valuable, and this product is a time waster.  I think for the few people that did manage to get the camera to work in other reviews, it was luck, and some of them even reveal that the connectivitiy of the camera to the computer is a gamble and not a guarantee.  At his point, you would save more time by seeking and hiring a sketch artist for your profile or panaramic shots you so richly desire.SUMMARY:The only thing I find statistically amazing is that I had all this bad luck with this product... and I don't believe in bad luck--just poor consumer choices and poor products.  What we have here is a combination of the two creating the perfect storm of a bad experience from Best Buy.  I should have done more homework...and I was irresponsible to fall for \"the sale\" or \"the good deal.\"  Typically, my stance is \"there is no such thing as a good deal\"... There is only the deal you thought you got.  And in this case, that's clearly what it is--a deal I THOUGHT I got.  As I sit here I realize that the small, plastic, blue box is only good enough to smash under my front car tire.  At the same time, I can celebrate my regretful purchase with a drink, and use the useless, 3 inch CD ROM as a coaster...and then I still have the less-then-two-foot USB proprietary cord unto which I can strangle myself...All whilst realizing that there was no good deal, or \"best buy\"... The only \"real deal\" is truly the one that is now undoubtedly making its way due North up my a--.Thanks for reading,Sincerely,Mathew.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7.0-megapixel CCD - Captures high-resolution images up to 3062 x 2292 pixels.\nZoom lens with 3x optical zoom/4x digital zoom - Lets you capture sharp, highly detailed long shots.\n2.5\" color LCD screen - For excellent visibility even in bright sunlight.\nDigital image stabilization and high sensitivity (ISO 1600) - Minimizes blur due to hand shake, low light conditions or times when flash is not possible.\nFace Detection technology - Tracks faces within the frame and automatically focuses and optimizes exposure.", "Name": "Insignia NS-DSC7B09 7MP Digital Camera BLUE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FQ4UOMSnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001W2HYYU"}}
