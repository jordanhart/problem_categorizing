{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for everyday use!", "Author": "Nicholas Eveland", "ReviewID": "R1Y2W7R4AZJ3SD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my wife and I so we can take high quality self shots when we go places. This is the perfect camera for that. The flip up screen is perfect and big enough to adjust yourself for a great shot. Another awesome feature is the remote shooting. the camera has built in wifi that can be used to connect to a smartphone. This is INCREDIBLY useful in a situation where you want to shoot a photo of a large group and get yourself in it too! It does take only about 10 seconds to set up and you can remotely access the camera. You can see what the camera sees, turn the flash on and off, zoom in and out, etc. and take a great picture! As far as picture quality goes, this camera rates pretty high for its size and price. Pictures come out very clear thanks to the stabilizer. Obviously not DSLR quality, but definitely better than an iPhone 5s. The 20x zoom is just absolutely perfect for those long shots. It has some really great features that make it easy to get a great shot. The automatic mode is perfect! It senses the mode that the camera should shoot in given the light and movement, etc. Also, for the more advanced photographers, you can easily change the Aperture, ISO, etc. All of this makes for a great picture. The video quality is fantastic and the stabilizer is really top notch. Full HD is clear for sure. I love how user friendly this camera is. It has tons of great features. I highly recommend this to anyone. It works especially well for a couple that wants to document their outings or trips and also for a family that wants to take their own group pictures. It really is a very high quality camera. I purchased it as a bundle with a 16gb sd card and case from costco for only $199. I would have easily paid $299 though.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had high hopes but...", "Author": "MChun", "ReviewID": "R22GVJ7O2GUD16", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera (I own two other lumix models), but the unresponsiveness of the camera makes it impossible to use for me.Physical Characteristics+ I like how the lens cover is integrated with the camera+ The back screen flips over for easy self shots+ The form factor is quite flat so its easy to slip into a bag or purseQuality- The outdoor pictures are fine, but the camera seems to struggle with even moderate low-light conditions+ Pictures with movement turned out pretty nicely and the camera is capable of taking multiple shots in quick succession+ The 20x zoom is impressive, but impractical. Zooming that far generally results in blurry shots when taken without a tripod and remoteOther considerations- The on/off button seems to be a step back from the on/off switch. I would often press it two to three times because I wasn't sure if it was on yet.- This general sense of unresponsiveness seems to extend to even zooming in and out- The wifi is a nice touch, but if I can't turn the camera on and take a quick shot within a few seconds it does not meet my needs", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Disappointing Non-Leica Cost-Down LUMIX", "Author": "KSY", "ReviewID": "R1KZADZI0CYXGW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been a huge fan of Panasonic compact cameras. This is the 4th Lumix point-and-shoot I own. The previous one DMC-ZS20 died 3 days after warranty expired but I still love Lumix.I was excited to see Panasonic finally has an articulated LCD display on a mega zoom. I got one as soon as it was available. The first impression I have is, all the buttons including the zoom dial are not very responsive. It takes seconds for any action to happen including turning the camera on and off.The next thing that surprised me is the poor quality of the still images and motion videos. It is far worse than the older models ZS3, ZS6 and ZS20. Then I realize why - unlike its predecessors, ZS35 does not have a Leica lenses.The auto focus is extremely slow for still images. Depending on the object, light condition, and where your previous focus point is, the auto focus takes anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds, if the camera can focus at all. You will definitely miss the previous moments in life. If you think that\u2019s bad, try the video recording. The auto focus does not work no matter you turn the Continuous AF on or off.The Wi-Fi set up is straight-forward but the use is cumbersome. This doesn\u2019t bother me because I don\u2019t use this feature anyway.I thought I had a defective unit so I returned it and got another one. Unfortunately the shortfalls are the same. Look at the bright side, at lease the quality is consistent.I will not recommend this camera to any one even for casual use.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, but not perfect", "Author": "Duchess Darcy", "ReviewID": "R35KAG270QFOJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only owned this for a few weeks so I am still learning the ins and outs. On the whole I like it. The size is compact and light weight. I can easily carry it in my pocket.What I can say so far:It takes sharp, clear pictures, although you have to hold the camera still so it can focus. The camera needs a few seconds to focus so you can get sharp pictures. The bad part is the wait. It may not be immediately ready when the perfect moment arrives.I used the automatic focus and manual, and automatic work better for me.The controls are easy to work with. Not being very tech savy, I dislike cameras with too many buttons, so this works well for me.The zoom works well and I have used it up to 9x so far and the picture is still sharp.The video part was easy to use, but it's best used with a tripod so it will be steady. I hand held the camera and it had to continually refocus because I moved. The quality of the video was uneven as a result, but I believe it will be better when the camera is stationary.The sound was fine though low and hard to hear at times. That could be my fault since I didn't adjust the volume level, but it is difficult to do while holding the camera and trying to stay still.I like the larger screen and the flip option if you want to take selfies. Tried it a few times and it works perfectly.One gripe is the lack of a printed manual. I still prefer to have one when I travel, rather than bringing a tablet. Call me old fashion but I like using the printed book. I can find things faster than using the downloaded version on my tablet. I printed out all the pages and bound it into a book since nothing was available for purchase.Downloading pictures to my laptop was fine even though I had to remove the cable and reattach it since it didn't work the first time. It took two or three tries before a connection was made and then it was very easy.I do agree with another poster that the off/on button doesn't work well. I usually press it twice, sometimes three times before the camera turns on.I also don't like how the zoom switch works. You have to move it left to right. I prefer the flip switch I had on an older model but that's just me.I wished this had come with a separate charger. I had to buy one with two extra batteries. Amazon does offer a package for around $25That's what I have so far. Will update when more features are examined.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice and easy!", "Author": "Brilite", "ReviewID": "R25QWPQB1VVG1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have the camera for a month and have not had issues.  It turned on quickly with one  press of the momentary on/off button.  It's loaded with features and they are easy to set.  Photos are clear and crisp and so are the videos.  The flip up LCD monitor is a great added feature.  I used it front facing and also at 90 degrees.  At 90 degrees I held the camera down at mid thigh to record video of my year old nephews. It allowed for a different perspective.  By staying in the wider focal lengths I was able to get close to subjects and stay within flash range.  There were no issues with indoor flash photos.  I downloaded the Panasonic Image App to my Tab 3 and linked the camera to it for remote operation.  The process was easy and remote operation was fun.  The camera has some weight to it and it is comfortable to hold. I didn't like the internal battery charger.  I purchased an external battery charger and two extra batteries.  Now, I like.  I am pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "2nd best point and shoot camera I've owned", "Author": "G. Lees", "ReviewID": "RXAAKQXIN3CJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried 9 different point and shoot cameras over the past 4 years, and this one has the 2nd best image quality of them all.  The best one is another Lumix: the Lumix SZ1.  The older SZ1 takes way better photos outdoors - better colors, exposure, dynamic range, and detail than this ZS35.  Both cameras are 16 MP, but the older SZ1 has a CCD sensor instead of MOS (and I assume that it must have a better lens, too because it captures such great detail outdoors).This new ZS35 is the best camera I've tried for indoors-without-a-flash photography.  Also, the flip-up selfie screen works great.I use -2/3 exposure indoors and outdoors to avoid rampant over-exposure.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera!", "Author": "L. Lindsay \"mega-consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R15IWBKZ5BTWWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this specifically for a series of concerts.  At the first one, when I took the camera out of my purse, it had moved from the AUTO to the P (PROGRAM) setting and I didn't notice.  Most of those pictures were awful but the few that did come out by accident were quite good.  At the next show, the low light scenes came out extremely dark so I switched to another camera.  I thought there must have been something wrong with this specific camera so I returned it.  But I loved the size and feel of the camera. I did take a picture of my puppy on the house with it and that was quite nice,  I found it slow when turning it on and off but again, that could have been just this particular camera.
