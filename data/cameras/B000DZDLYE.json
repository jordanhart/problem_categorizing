{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First Day with My Camera", "Author": "Zarjay", "ReviewID": "R2LK1CK37ET07U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung Digimax S500 camera arrived this morning, and I've been spending the entire day testing it out.I've never owned a good digital camera before (my previous cameras were all $20-or-less cameras of poor quality), and so far, I'm glad that I chose this camera to be my first.  It has an attractive design, is easy to hold, and is easy to use.This morning, I quickly opened the box and inserted the batteries that came with it, wanting impatiently to test out the camera.  I took a few pictures of myself, which came out disappointingly blurry.  I realized that my arm was too unsteady when I took the picture, and after switching the camera mode from \"auto\" to \"children,\" I solved my blurriness problem.  (The \"children\" mode is meant for taking pictures of moving objects.)I spent a few minutes figuring out the controls, which weren't too difficult to get used to.  The user's manual was explanative enough for me to understand any features I wasn't too sure on, such as how the different modes worked and how to get the flash working.At the highest setting (5MP with Super Fine Quality), I was only able to take about 6 pictures total.  After inserting my 128MB SD memory card, however, that count increased to 46.  I was tempted to insert my 1GB SD memory card, but my 128MB card is sufficient enough for my needs.  Unless I wanted to store hundreds of pictures or capture nearly an hour of video, I don't need to use my 1GB card.Taking my digital camera out for a walk around the city was a fun experience.  After uploading the pictures to my computer and witnessing the great quality of the pictures I had taken, I was convinced that I had bought the right camera.The LCD screen is much darker in daylight than it is indoors, and so the display fooled me into thinking some of my pictures were too dark when I took them.  After viewing them on my computer, I realized that the quality of the pictures was better and brighter than what I had thought when viewing them from the LCD screen.After about 4-5 hours of usage, I noticed the battery started to get low, which means I'll need to replace the batteries soon.  I recommend buying rechargeable batteries, or else you'll most likely be buying AA batteries frequently if you like taking lots of pictures.I noticed many extra features the camera has, including its special effects and its various scene modes.  I haven't experimented with these features yet, because I'm comfortable with just using the \"auto,\" \"children,\" and \"manual\" modes.Since I've never owned a decent camera before, I was afraid that the controls might be too confusing, but that thankfully wasn't the case.  Pressing the lightning bolt arrow next to the Menu/OK button toggles what type of flash I want, and the top 'W' and 'T' buttons let me zoom in or out to my liking.  I click the button next to the \"trash can\" symbol to delete pictures, and I press the 'E' button if I want to use some extra effects.  The controls seem pretty self-explanatory.In order to upload the camera's pictures onto my computer, I had to install the software on the CD included with the camera.  The installation process didn't take very long, and the CD even comes with its own software for viewing photos (Digimax Master 1.0).  I haven't used it, though, because all I need to do is plug in the camera using the included USB cable and copy the pictures from the camera onto my computer.  The computer recognizes the camera as a \"removable drive\" (my computer recognizes my camera as the F: drive), and after opening the \"DCIM\" folder, I can view and upload all the pictures I've taken.I'm currently satisfied with this camera, although since I've had this camera for only a day, I can't say anything about how this camera will perform in the long run or if there are any problems that might occur after long-term usage.  I can definitely say, however, that I'm satisfied with the picture quality and the camera's performance and ease of use.  I'd recommend this camera to anyone who wanted to easily take and upload high quality pictures to his/her computer.It nicely fits in your pocket, has more settings than you need, and has an SD slot for you to expand its memory capabilities.  I recommend buying a 128MB SD card if you're a modest photographer, or a 512MB one if you want the extra space.  A 1GB might be going a little overboard, but it's nice to think of how many pictures and video you could store on it.  Keep in mind, however, that flash memory will wear out over time.  I don't know the actual life of an SD memory card, but I would assume that the card would start to wear out after about 60,000 read/write cycles.  So flash memory may last for a long time, but don't expect your 1GB memory card to last you a lifetime.In conclusion, this is a wonderful digital camera, and I am a happy customer.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "packs a punch for the price...", "Author": "Diverse", "ReviewID": "RQL8ZIFCH89GF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the S500 and am a satisfied customer. It has a beautiful LCD screen, the optical zoom is top notch and even the quality of the movie mode is great by most standards. Picture quality is amazing, and it doesn't take a professional to figure it all out. Just point and click. At a price tag of $180, you can't really ask for more... the sound quality while shooting in movie mode is not the prettiest but what would you expect from a digital camera. Also, plan on buying rechargable batteries otherwise your going to make Duracell very rich.

All small digital cameras have difficulty with flash that won't reach.  Outdoor photos are always great (in good sun) and indoor pictures are great as long as you remember that the little flash does not go to the far side of the cathedral!  If you need that kind of photograph then buy a camera that has a connection for external flash.I'm using this camera for field work and Geocaching.  I'm delighted with the quality of the photos and movies.

It takes beautiful pictures, is very easy to operate, and the videos it takes are great too. Nice zoom-in features. I like the small size, and it fits in your hand quite well. I love how it doesn't eat up battery life. I bought some Energizer rechargeable (2500 mAh)batteries, and I can play with this camera almost all day and still have battery life for the next day without recharging. I took some extreme close ups of some small flowers, and the crystal clear details are amazing. It also is problem free, quick and simple when transfering your pictures to your computer. I can't think of anything negative to say about this camera. A true bargain for it's price, considering it's superb performance and features.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Amanda Van West", "ReviewID": "R17XB5FXV7FN9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never owned a digital camera, so it took a long time reading reviews for various cameras in this price range until I came upon this camera. Even though there were only a few reviews, it sounded like it would be a good camera for my needs. I wanted something at least 4 or 5 MP; big LCD screen; video with sound; optical zoom; lots of features. Needless to say, this fit the bill perfectly! I won a brand new one on eBay for only $125. It just arrived the other day, and I've been testing out all of the features. The night mode feature is really cool. If you use it while taking a picture of something that's moving, it has some weird effects. The different color modes are also fun (b&w;, sepia, red, green, blue, negative, etc.), as are the frames. The macro feature is awesome! I don't have a steady hand, so I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get any clear pictures in this mode. I tried it out on some flowers, and the pictures came out so beautifully! I also used the 'children' mode on my cats, and was able to capture some great pictures. Another thing that I like playing around with is the manual mode. You can do slow flash, and set it up to 8 seconds, I believe. With that setting, if you point the camera on one object (say, a person) for half of the time, and then point it on another (a background) you get a cool ghostly effect!The only negative thing I'd have to say is that it does eat up batteries really quickly, so you either have to carry a lot of extras on hand, or get rechargeable batteries.Other than that, this is a fantastic camera...especially for the price! :)", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera.", "Author": "K. Mills", "ReviewID": "R25U3DVBZXHKXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera for the most part.  I had alot of problems with it at first due to the batteries I was using, they were rechargable, but were old.  Once I got some new rechargable batteries, though, it worked just fine.  Don't buy this if you plan on taking alot of pictures without flash, because they almost always turn out blurry without flash, no matter how steady your hand is.  When it's low on batteries, it freezes up, and you have to take the batteries out to get it to turn off.  There is no sound while you zoom in while making a video, but after you're done zooming it is fine.  I don't recommend using the software that comes with the product; just plug it in and wait for the Camera Wizard to appear.  Has decent editing features, such as changing the color of the picture [black and white, sepia, red, green, blue, and negative], allows you to highlight certain areas of the picture you are taking, and has 9 different photo frames you can choose from.  You can also resize, rotate, and do slideshows.  You can also record audio without video, and also add audio to pictures.  Overall, it's a pretty great camera.  I recommend it if you have amazing rechargable batteries!", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing, if you know how to use it!!!", "Author": "R. Shah \"~Reeya\"", "ReviewID": "R2678ZSQW05DIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a couple of weeks ago. I'm a teen, and my mom made me spend my own money for the camera and the rechargeable batteries. So I needed something affordable, but well worth my money!!!! After spending days and days of researching, with absolutely NO help from any siblings or parents, I decided to get this camera. I urge you to see the pictures other members of Amazon have uploaded, to see the great clarity you get with these pictures.I bought the camera with rechargeable batteries from the Sam's Club, for an approximate total of $185. Not bad at all!!!Of course, as soon as I got home, I (carefully) tore open the box and all of the wrappings, put in the batteries that came with the camera, loaded the memory card, and started snapping away. The pictures were amazingly clear. They were crisp and full of detail. After playing around with it, I realized that with low battery, the pictures got blurry. The flash was necessary to keep the picture from going blurry. This was annoying, but then I decided to try the \"Auto\" mode, and it was much better! The manual mode is also great. I could take a picture of my fan on \"high\", and it looks like the fan is stopped!!The frames are so much fun, as are the different colors, such as sepia, black and white, red, green, blue, and negative.All in all, this is a GREAT camera. Well-worth the money!!! It's extremely simple to use, and gets amazing pictures. The blurriness (with low battery) gets slightly annoying, but with just a few minutes of playing around with the camera, it was fixed.The one HUGE downside to this camera: I can't figure out how to get the memory chip out!!

I bought this camera through amazon for my Graduation present. I have it for already a few months and its a good camera. Its easy to use, lots of different settings, a large nice screen, even makes long movies. Its not as small as the other more expensive cameras, but its not huge and bulky. There is a few negetive things to it: It uses batteries, and charging it mean you have to buy new ones. I solved this problem by buying rechargeble batteries, they last longer and you can reuse them. The battery life on this camera is not that great too. Well that might be the fault of my duracel batteries. If this camera would have better battery life then it would be five stars.

Obviously from the price and features that is implied, but even so some expect more than what they pay for.This camera is ideal, however, for those who want to take decent pictures of family, friends, and pets.For that reason this camera is great for teenagers and first-timers.The Samsung S500 is extremely easy to use, in fact I never once looked at the manual. The buttons are self explanatory, as well as the menus and options.I hate to use a cliche, but it probably was more difficult getting the camera out of the box than it is using it.My only complaint is that the nightshot can be just terrible at times. It will perform well about 50% of the time, and the videos come out almost perfect at night time, but it falls short too many times at night. This can be especially frustrating during the holidays when you don't want to miss a moment but sometimes do because your nightshot wasn't working well.Also, not so much of a complaint as much as a concern, but whenever I hook up my camera to view pictures on my TV, audio does not work. I have the video and audio cables plugged in correctly, i know it's not an issue with that. I don't know if this is an issue with everyone, but it was slightly dissapointing;however, i would not discourage anyone from buying this camera on account of that.Pros:-Pretty small and thin.-Big, bright screen. [2.4 inch]-Software is a breeze to install and use.-Very easy to manage and understand.-Video turns out well.Cons:-Some think the battery space makes the front of the camera a little bulky. This does not bother me at all, but I thought I'd put that out there.-Pictures sometimes come out extremely blurry without the flash on. This can be frustrating when you need a clear picture without washing the foreground out.-It's practically impossible to use this camera without the purchase of rechargeable batteries. Invest a good $30 or so and you'll be satisfied.-Something I've noticed more and more lately is the lagged playback time after you take a picture. Sure, it may be only about 5-7 extra seconds, but that can be a alot when you're in a rush.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Okay camera...when it works!!", "Author": "S.

I used to have a big clunky Kodak digital camera but one month before my first mission trip to the Dominican Republic, I decided I needed to upgrade my camera so I could get some great pictures to document this special week in the life of my kids and me and not have to carry around that big camera.I went to my local Wal-Mart and started looking at cameras.  The Samsung Digimax S500 immediately caught my eye as it was pocket sized but still had a lot of nice features, more than I would need on a normal trip.I took some time to go through the manual, learning all about the basic camera operations.  The trip was a huge success!  I bought a 2 Gig SD card and took so many pictures and video clips by the 4th day that I had to upload them to a laptop to make room for more!Even after my second mission trip in as many years, the picture quality continues to blow me away for such a small, easy to operate point-and-shoot!And the video capability...wow!  My two children are in the high school marching band.  I have taken numerous video clips of their performances for the past two years.  The sound and image quality of the clips are great.  It is nice not to have to carry around a video camera, as well now.  The only thing you have to know is that if you zoom in while video taping, the sound stops until you let go of the zoom button...a small price to pay for such an awesome camera.I rode my Harley from Atlanta to Canada and back...4900 miles last summer.

Indoor was great, even in the dark, the flash was the BEST!Until 1999, that is!  I took a trip to Africa, and sand must've gotten lodged in the lens, and since then, I've had problems. The lens would only come out 1/2 way, then I'd have to pull it out while holding the power button. That worked. However, it's unreliable, and I figured I'd buy this black used one. Unfortunately, it wouldn't even turn on 99% of the time, despite me buying fresh rechargeable batteries, and charging the batteries all night.  I returned it promptly!So would I buy this camera again? Yes, but knowing that one day it will develop lens issues if the slightest thing gets in there.

From new it hasn't worked with the regular batteries--just freezes up when you go to press the shutter. We've had better success with rechargables (it does have two battery setting depending on what kind of battery you're using and we've tried both settings) but it still freezes up without warning. We have to take the batteries out and leave them out for 30 seconds to 5 minutes before the thing will work again. Batteries don't last long at all. The shutter response is very slow, disappointing when you're trying to catch a fleeting smile from a small child. The only reason we put up with it for this long is because we can't afford a new one and film is too expensive to use in my nice SLR film camera with the amount of pictures I take.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "A General-Use Camera", "Author": "Acute Observer", "ReviewID": "R1HXPDJN106FP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung Digimax S500This digital camera has many features. You must read the manual if you never used a camera like this. Page 5 identifies the features. Set the `Mode dial' to AUTO, insert fresh AA batteries (those designed for digital cameras are best), then turn on the `Power button'. Page 12 explains how to set the Date/Time and Languages (any of 22 languages). You should read the pages on using the camera buttons, first those needed to take still photographs. Page 13 explains the `LCD monitor indicator' on this camera. The `Size' and `Quality' affect the size of the file and the number that can fit on the memory card. Pages 53 to 58 explain the `Setup Menu'. You should install the application software before downloading pictures to your PC. If you use Ni-MH rechargeable batteries you must use the `Setup Menu' to identify these batteries.If you choose `1600x1200' for `Size' and `Fine' for `Quality' the photo files will need about 524Kb of file space (two per megabyte). You can delete unwanted photos from memory. The SD memory card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries too weak for this camera can still be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras. If the batteries are weakening an indicator will show less than 3 bars. If the batteries are too weak the camera will shut down, or the screen will just go blank with the lens extended. You must put in fresh batteries to recover and turn the camera on or off. If you should press the lens to one side it can stick and not retract. Gently press the lens toward the center and turn off the camera [this worked for me]. Like other delicate electronic devices, dropping it on a hard surface may cause expensive damage.The installation software requires a Pentium or AMD K6-2 with Windows 98, 98SE, Me, 2000, or XP. To install a memory card first turn off the camera and open the cover. You can use 2GB, 1Gb, 512Mb (or smaller) memory cards. The front of the memory card faces the front of the camera, the pins on the card face the back. Page 5 of the manual explains how to format the memory card before use. This will also delete all photos on the memory card. The manual is adequate but could use more explanations and a larger font.

A 256 MB SD card will hold a 3.5 minute video, so if you do the math..potentially you can take almost an hour long video at 30fps, 640X480!  That's awesome and NO TAPES..you got to love that!  On auto mode, it takes great pictures!  Also, if you get 2700 NimH rechargeable batteries, the battery life will last for an hour long video recording as well.
