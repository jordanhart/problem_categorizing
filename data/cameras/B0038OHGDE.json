These worked great to eliminate ghosting and roll bars I was getting with a cheaper set (the black and green kind).

I used CAT 6 cable with them and used it to feed 2 cameras,  have seen to double up the power wires but my runs were less than 25 feet so I thought I would try and use one cable for 2 cameras close to each other and works fine.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "justin dysart \"Justin\"", "ReviewID": "R2QTT9THHQ6FRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are great for converting Cat5e to an Audio or Video signal.

Make sure you have room: total length is almost 2 inches, and the wires exit the box on the square end. They're small enough to fit on adjacent terminals but do stick out quite far from the DVR.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Balun for CCTV", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "RG0C6XMF2GBUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed to have a long run for CAT6 cable to hook up my home video security system.  (Qsee brand).  These Baluns allowed me to run 4 cameras off a single CAT6 run.  There was no noticeable degration in the video clarity or camer performance.  Great deal and saved me lots of money compared to running individual RG 59 runs for each camera.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap price, small size, and works great...", "Author": "FuFa", "ReviewID": "R3BJO7I83F0YGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UTP-Coax video baluns are the easiest way to hook up analog video cameras for a home CCTV setup, and these little buggers do the job just fine.  They are priced well, and work great.  All you need is a small screwdriver to secure each wire in place.NOTES ABOUT USING BALUNS FOR CCTV VIDEO:Video baluns are great, and can make your install faster, cheaper, and with less interference than running separate coax/power cables (or buying expensive siamese cable). Instead of running a thick coax cable and a separate power cable to each camera, you only have to run a single UTP (cat5, cat5e, cat6) cable.  Use one color pair for the video and parallel the other 3 pairs for camera power.  You will need some male DC power connectors as well (unless you want to splice, solder, and heat shrink the wires instead).  I would also highly recommend using a separate wall-mount CCTV camera power supply box with individually fused outputs.  Not only it is safer, but when running power over UTP cable, this makes for a much neater, more professional looking installation, as opposed to using the cheap laptop type power bricks with power splitter cables that often come with most home CCTV systems.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great connector", "Author": "Charles M.
