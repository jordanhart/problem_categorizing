I don't know why they have been discontinued, because these are so much better than the \"Toy\" like cameras system that GE is still offering (I've had a couple of them and they're not very good)!  I like these systems so well that I figured I'd better have a backup just in case something went wrong in the future. I have a backup receiver and by buying this camera, I now have a complete system for backup.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003OUWACO"}}
