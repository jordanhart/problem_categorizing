After getting the M753 I was hoping this would be a good replacement but now it's going back.  I like that the camera battery can be charged with the USB cable (I wish all cameras could do this) in addition to the Kodak docking station.  Also, if you have a power cord from a non-compatible docking station you can still plug it into the camera to charge it (the DX6440 docking station does not work with M753).  I really the fact that kodak cameras can charge the battery because I never liked doing the AA rechargeable battery-shuffle.  Why can't the camera charge them???I tested the camera and a lot of the pictures had noise in them and were grainy even in low light.  My old DX6440 was better and pictures seemed clearer.  Also, even though the M753 is very light and small, it feels and look cheaply made.  It seems like it wouldn't take much to break this.  I wouldn't mind some additional weight to the camera if it made it more solid and rigid.Here's the rundown:Pros:Small and light (mostly because battery is a small re-chargeable, not heavier AA style)USB, docking station, or power cord can charge the battery.Has a big 2.5 LCD and more features then cameras made a few years ago.Cons:Pictures seemed grainy in low light - even with the flash and in high ISO modeCamera doesn't use AA (not a problem for me, but maybe for others)Feels flimsy and cheaply madeFinally, one shouldn't get hung up on megapixels when shopping for a camera.  Look at getting a camera with a high quality lens that can take crisp clear pictures (the DX6440 has a better 4X optical lens).  A 4-6 megapixel with a good lens vs an 7-8 megapixel with a poor lens isn't worth the extra money.  You can save a few bucks because the market price of most consumer cameras are driven by megapixels.", "Date": "September 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Too good to be true...", "Author": "Nick C.", "ReviewID": "RF83MUSLJBDRD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like some of the other reviews, I was disappointed with this camera.  I previously owned a 4 megapixel Kodak DX7440 and it took great pics, but was a little too bulky for a carry around camera.  I was pleased to find this camera because of its size, low cost and 7MP quality.  Out of the box I was excited after I snapped a few pics.  They looked fantastic on the view screen.  I don't agree with the other reviews about it feeling cheap.  I thought it felt really nice.  Buttons in the right place and raised just enough to access them.  The problem came in when I downloaded the pics onto my computer. The download went flawlessly, but the pics looked very grainy/noisy.  Way too grainy for a brand new 7MP camera.  I took pictures in several settings, but found the same 'blah' quality with everthing I tried.  I played with all the settings and tried different MP settings with no luck.  I do not know much about cameras, but I think this camera has a lower quality lens.  I will probably return it and try a different one....it was too good to be true...", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Super camera for the price", "Author": "Donna Reynolds", "ReviewID": "R198TLA1BNOXOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing.  It is easy to set up and interfaced with my PC easily.  The menu is easy to navigate and is pretty much the same as my older Kodak model so I didn't have to reinvent the wheel.  The camera has a close-up model, a stabilization feature and an auto feature.  The close-up mode automatically focuses and takes AWESOME closeup shots.  It will be great for taking pictures of jewelry and small items to sell on eBay.The dial is pretty small and the icons are hard to read, but the screen tells you what mode you're in so that takes care of that.  I love the design of this camera too.I've tested the video mode and it works great.  Love this camera!

I didnt notice that sound with my C, L, and v series. They dont have the L series anymore, but it was excellant. For the price, this camera is better than other brands by far though. I will add some pictures I took with this camera. I like how you can charge it with your computer. The L ion battery last a long time.

I love the fact that you can charge it with a USB cable, and dont have to worry with batteries. But, after having it for less than a year, the only thing the USB cable does for me is charge it -- it no longer works for uploading photos to the computer. Luckily we have a laptop and I can just take my memory card out and put it in the laptop to upload them.The photo quality is no good. It is very grainy no matter what ISO or flash settings you use. Also, when I take pictures with it, it makes the sound like the picture was taken, but it pauses for a second or two and THEN it actually takes the picture?! It has done that several times, and ruined several shots.This camera is not worth $150 and I would not recommend it to anyone, ever.

I've used it to take hundreds of shots of my friends at school, and here is my list of pros and cons for this camera:Pro:- Convenient: It is very light and smal in size. It fits into many handbags, and isn't hard to carry around.- Settings: It has a wide range of settings you can use to take pictures with.- Easy-to-use: The buttons and the wheel on the camera are pretty self-explanatory. After fundling around with it for a little while, I got the hang of it fairly quickly.- Digital Image Stabilization: My friends are always moving around, and this feature comes in handy when trying to snap shots of them.- Screen: The screen takes up the majority of the back of the camera. You can clearly see the entire picture on that little screen.- Flash: The flash of this camera is extremely bright.Cons:- Grainy: The other reviews weren't lying-- the pictures taken by this camera are fairly grainy. Under the \"Auto\" setting, the camera functions pretty well; but under any other setting, such as Digital Image Stabilization, blown-up copies of these images will come out grainy.- Slow reaction rate: I'm fairly sure there's a technical term for this, but this is what my friends and I refer to it as. The camera will not instantaneously take photographs-- a second or two may elapse between the press of the button and actual taking of the photograph. This may be due to the camera automatically focusing itself, but you may miss many snap-or-miss moments with it.- Too-senstive \"Auto\" Setting: This camera will be able to detect even the slightest shaking of your hand when on Auto. Pictures may come out blurry as a result of this, and this is another reason why I am forced to resort to the Digital Image Stabilization setting.All-in-all, however, I think this is a good camera for casual use. It's a nice camera for kids to use, since it's rather cheap in price and still performs all the regular functions a camera should.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than they say", "Author": "Geeky guy", "ReviewID": "R3RF6BOKPOQQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my teenage daughter. She has taken over two thousand pictures since December. And I tell you, they are sharp and look great. I also have a 6MB and a 3MB camera, and this 7MB camera is noticeably better in image quality. The few low quality pictures I've seen are due to motion blur, which you get with any camera without a tripod. Sometimes the LCD looks a little greenish. The video also works well. It doesn't seem to be 30 fps, but maybe more like 15-20. Still very viewable for most situations.So why do all the other reviews say the pictures are grainy? I have no idea. I say, try it in the store if you can. Take a picture and then look at it in the viewfinder and zoom in. Try that with a few cameras and see how this compares.
