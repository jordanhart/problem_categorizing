{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst camera ever", "Author": "KellyK", "ReviewID": "RVFRCUG1T2HR5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've bought a lot of cheap cameras over the last 20 years. Lots of disposables. Several $20 digitals. Cameras I can take to remote areas or to places where the probability of losing or messing up a camera is high. But this camera is the absolute worst of them all.I chose this camera because it was cheap, it's has video and because it's purple. No, I don't have a thing for purple but I was taking it on a remote camping trip into the desert and it would be easier to find than a dark colored one in my tent or backpack. I didn't want to take my good camera or my phone out for fear of the dust killing them.First: things that are no fault of the camera, just stuff I found frustrating.  This camera doesn't have a flash. I know, maybe read the label or take a closer look. It didn't occur to be to look because since when doesn't even the basic camera have a flash? Second, no sound on the video. Not a big deal, most cheap ones don't but I'm just putting it out there.  Better you not be surprised or disappointed. I knew the view window was tiny but you don't realize just how tiny until you're trying to look at your photo you just took. Which brings me to the fact that you can't see it anyway because of the low quality screen. It didn't matter what kind of light I was in or where I was, you couldn't see more than an outline of anything on that screen.Now on to why this camera gets no love from me. The real issue with this camera was the blue hue that was cast on all my photos. It looked like I was photographing through blue film. Was the purple colored shell suppose to clue me in? Is it a novelty camera? It's not a little color, it's a lot. My brother in law is highly skilled in photoshop and even he couldn't get rid of the tint and make the photo look natural. I put in a different card just to make sure it wasn't that and nope.. it was the camera. Also, just forget the zoom. Useless. Even zooming just a tiny bit left those photos so fuzzy you can't make out anything. I have no idea if these are issues with all these cameras or if this was a fluke. I didn't bother calling anyone about it because it was 20 bucks and I don't want a replacement. The worst of this is that I took it to my first Burning Man trip and NONE of my photos are good enough quality to show them to anyone. No night photos because no flash and what are Burning Man photos if you can't photograph fire!? Ahhh, but I do have the memories. And those are probably rose colored. ;) lol", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Camera", "Author": "Xavier", "ReviewID": "R36UZ4UKAKIZIZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'd got this camera a few months ago, a red one, and it barely work. First when i inserted some good batteries by alkaline, it turned on. But all it shows was camera mode. I tried turning it to video but the shutter button doesn't work. I got angry at this thing and thinking why they sell it? it's a waste of $20.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "good luck if you buy this!!", "Author": "jennifer kunz", "ReviewID": "R3KNKVYGZG4EU8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, I don't normally go online to rant about the crappiness of a particular product, but this one was particularly bad, so here I am.Does Not Work. It lets you take 1 photo before you're out of memory without an SD card (to be expected) but once you put in a SD card it doesn't seem to recognize it, and the whole camera goes batcrap stupid. I attempted troubleshooting this problem but the camera ran out of batteries after less than 5 minutes of fiddling. I put new batteries in, with a different SD card and now all I get is a white screen (if it turns on) or a black screen (if it won't)I did NOT expect a good camera for 20 dollars, but did expect a crappy camera that would turn on and take a photo at fairly low quality. This is what I wanted, and expected. My expectations were incredibly low for this product, and somehow it still managed to be entirely disappointing.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stinks on ice Vivitar Vivicam V46 has no sound--no mike!", "Author": "Danarose Crystal \"DanaRose Crystal\"", "ReviewID": "R2OQ3TDWU4ZCV9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Someone said that Vivitar made some cameras without audio mikes, and this was one of them. That is insane! Vivitar might well be sued for emotional abuse by some people. One person wrote their little daughter was in tears over this matter. I ought to have known better. I bought a putrid cheap camcorder from Big Lots and video/audio was poor. I was in a hurry this time, my GOOD camera with 1080i had been stolen by the maintenance man at Anaheim's Rainbow Inn, along with my 32 GB hard drive, and I wanted a camera. I ought to have researched this before depending upon it. Now my vacation video is ruined. I say let's sue Vivitar in a class action lawsuit. They apparently made this camera deliberately with no audio capability, \"to keep cost down.\" Well, that is cheating and deceiving us, because we expect cameras with video functions to record sound. Unless the outside package says it has no mike, it is a natural assumption on our part to think it has, since many still cameras have video/audio function. I would've used my cell phone had I known! This is on clearance at Target stores, which is where I got it. Should have known. Vivitar should instead just have recalled it, or supplied a sticker telling that there is no mike.My classic Brownie Bullet was better than this. Really! I loved it, compared to lousy cheap digital cams of today!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009KDXHBC"}}
