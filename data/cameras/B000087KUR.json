The camera was great. Then, kodak came out with the DCS-14n as a replacement. It was a huge mistake. The DCS-14n's sensor is simply of lower quality, shadows sometimes come out magenta. There is also a flare issue. Grey gradients, depending on the density come out green or yellow. And there are other issues as well, but you get the point. In conclusion, the DCS-760 was a far better camera.Kodak recommends the use of a good lens with the DCS-14n to eliminate flare. We used the same lens to test both cameras, and the tests were performed under the same conditions. The results were very clear to us: keep the DCS-760.", "Date": "November 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but now serves a very limited need", "Author": "DeeZer", "ReviewID": "R1GAYX5IYZ5U9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kodak Pro SLR/N a good number of years ago.  It is the successor to the featured Kodak DCS-14N.  Since then, I have purchased five different Nikons to replace the work performed by the camera in my studio.  Most notably, I recently purchased a Nikon D800 and a Nikon D800E.And yet, I keep a spot open for using the Kodak with a Zeiss 25mm for super sharp wide-angle, high resolution macro shots.  Because I have restricted the camera to studio use, it's only failure is of little consequence to me.  A full charge on the OEM battery is worth about fifty (maybe fifty-three) shots.  Otherwise, the photos it produces are excellent - no noise and great color.  For all my work, I keep the ISO at 400, or less.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is great!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RMHGZXEI03NI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The detail and resolution is unmatched!It does take a little bit of time to learn all of the features!", "Date": "May 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Absoulutly fantastic  \"A++\"", "Author": "kamyar Naderi", "ReviewID": "RL2MH2G282GY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The perfect digital camera ever made with over 13 mega pixels, this is the best and the only camera that any professional photographer should have.Very easy to use, much lighter than previous DCR-760 and much cheaper (about $... without lens).", "Date": "January 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Ghost camera", "Author": "Richard Zerby", "ReviewID": "R2QFMADXAGBX7F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "How can anyone write a reveiw of this camera?No one in the WORLD has been able to use or reveiw it, let alone hold one.Kodak is 6 months behind release date on this camera and still has not shipped one.
