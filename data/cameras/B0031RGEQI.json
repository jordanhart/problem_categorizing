My only complant is its battery life which is good, but just not as good as the rest of the camera. It takes super great pictures, and has many useful features and shooting modes. Like panorama, Magic, and beauty. I love having the 7X optical zoom, along with the 5X digital. You can use the digital zoom even while shooting video. It has this cool feature that I really like called Sequential shooting, which can take many many picture very fast. Of course it reduces the quality of the photo, but not to an unbearable level, and if you don't zoom in unnoticeable.Pros-*Picture quality*Ease of use*Features*Zoom*SpeedCons-*Perfect camera, just not enough battery lifeI love this camera and encourage you to buy it. The battery wont trouble you unless you are going on a trip like I was and you take over 400 pictures a day.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic Point and Shoot", "Author": "Lit Lover", "ReviewID": "R1IVJ51VWA9ZGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Olympus a few days before a big trip to France.  I hoped it wasn't a dud, but I had looked around at local stores and online reviews and it kept standing out to me.  I was concerned at first about having no physical \"how to\" manual, but it hasn't been a problem.  I played with all the features on my trip, and I have to say my photos have been stunning - clear, amazing colors, great range of view.  The panorama feature especially has been a treat - easy to use and it creates such unique perspectives.  The macro feature also gave my close-up shots crisp definition with great depth.  I can't count the number of times I've said \"I love this camera!\"  The only piece I'm not crazy about is that it's a rechargeable battery, so I have to think ahead and make sure it's charged before taking it somewhere; not great for spontaneous needs, but I'll deal with it.  The best part of all of this is, I would have paid so more for it - the price can't be beat.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a feature-rich point and shoot.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "olympus stylus7030", "Author": "Lois Flynn", "ReviewID": "R3SRT57WYUBYWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd Olympus Stylus camera I have bought.

For a point-and-shoot camera, the product attributes and picture quality are excellent (far exceeding the performance of both a Nikon Coolpix and a Canon Powershot owned by other members of my family).So why only 2 stars? Unfortunately it seems we can no longer trust Olympus customer service. The repair center in Hauppage New York failed to acknowledge a legitimate warranty claim for a lens-cover malfunction and subsequent lens damage to my camera. If customer service is a consideration in your purchase, I recommend you choose a different brand.Update - November 2012As a spare/occasional camera, I'm still using the (expensively repaired) 7010 and continue to achieve quite acceptable, good-resolution results with it. A couple of points to note for those who may still be in the market for one. 1) Do not risk getting this camera wet. Do not take it out in the rain. Do not take it out in high humidity. Do not take it out in fog. Do not even put it in the vicinity of water droplets. Don't say you weren't warned! 2)The auto-white-balance mode has always tended to create pictures which are kinda washed-out (in any lighting conditions) and require quite a bit of post-processing to look their best. The long and short of it is that it was a competitive camera with an excellent zoom lens for its day. It is capable of taking great pictures using the non-auto-WB modes and in dry conditions, but for another 20-30 dollars, you can get much better Sony and Lumix (maybe even Olympus?) point-and-shoots nowadays.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "HMoni", "ReviewID": "R2S261CQ382HVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my purchased item about 4 days after I ordered it.

I got it opened again but was doubting the durabilty of this happening and staying in one piece.
