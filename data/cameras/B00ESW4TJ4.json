I'm thinking pork belly futures.Everything negative that you have read about this camera is probably true. Please understand that I love this camera to pieces. But I'm not a complete idiot. Here is my take on the worst problems.Internet Connectivity and Image Accessibility<update 1/30/2024>Wow!The Android and iOS apps can now share images to their device'sGallery. The images can be uploaded To Google+ And shared or not according to your preferences or Google maps if you've allowed GPS location info to be transferred from the phone and are comfortable with public view.On Google+, viewers can look at the necessarily distorted static images or switch into the full 360 immersive mode.I think that this represents real progress in just a couple of months.</update>What I consider to be its worst problem is correctable in software: Ricoh Pentax have not released code in any form (source, binary, app, servlet, library) that allows for the independent display of the .jpg images produced by the Theta. Currently, the only approved way to get an image on the internet is to use either Ricoh's free iOS app or Microsoft's Photosynth app to push the image to Ricoh's servers at theta360.com. Having done that, one can link to the page on which the image resides (not the image itself). Let's say that you have a blog and want to show someone a 360 degree view that you've taken. In your blog text, you'd insert a link to image page on theta360.com. Having clicked that link, your reader is then directed to the Ricoh server and can readily navigate via touch or mouse around your image. Unfortunately, the reader is also subjected to any decorations or ads that Ricoh chooses to weigh down the image with. For some people, this will be a dealbreaker. You are completely at Ricoh's mercy. What happens if -- perish the thought -- this $400 misunderstanding isn't the huge hit that Ricoh hopes it will be? How about they shut down the server and you're toast? Won't happen? Right.Let's take the case that you're trying to write a review of the Theta and have uploaded a conventional .jpg that is a highly cropped  extract of a 360 image that shows how unobtrusive the camera mount is. Amazon encourages the reviewer to add notes to the image. Suppose in  your note you want to add a link to the whole glorious picture to show how tiny and unobtrusive the camera stand is. Well, you cannot, because Amazon don't allow links to images in this context. Nor should they. They don't want to depend on a third party (in this case theta360) who could offer unreliable service, or change the content of the link to an ad or pornography or whatever. The obvious solution is to upload the whole image to Amazon.  Oops, you can't do that because Ricoh only supports links to the page on which the image resides. And Amazon only allows images.One solution is for a Ricoh to register a specific extension for the Theta's images, say .sir which would stand for spherical image Ricoh. Then they could offer operating system level drivers or browser extensions or server side support for that extension which would handle the image rendering. This must sound very tedious. I wouldn't be talking about it if a Ricoh had properly dealt with it.Image QualityI got hooked on digital panoramas in the late 1990s. I think that the camera I was using then produced two meg images. The stitching software I could find allowed for stitching together an arbitrary number of images to create a long strip of up to 360 degrees. There was no concept of stitching together two bands along their long axes. So the product of a fair amount of effort was a skinny vertical or horizontal photo. Even skinnier if you cropped the scalloped edges. In contrast, the theta quickly delivers a complete 360 degree image. Whatever stitching that is done is hidden from the user. In my experience, banding that occurs where the two hemispheres is subtly or non-existent. Finger scrolling through the image on my iPod is exciting. Maybe I'm easily amused, but I just love it.What isn't exciting is the image quality, which is terrible, probably worse than I was getting with the cameras available to me in the nineties. Particularly in the interior shots, the digital grain is like marbles. I'm pretty sure that the software that makes the exposure decides to boost the ISO film speed equivalent rather than extending the exposure. This is crazy. There out to be a setting that asks if the camera is on some sort of support. If it is, i can see no reason why the software that drives the camera cannot increase the exposure time. If the sensor is like that on any other digital camera I've seen, keeping the ISO low should yield profound improvement in resolution.Another IQ issue that is a little trickier is exposure latitude. Almost be definition, any 360 image is going to have a wide range of illumination, often beyond the capability of any sensor to capture in a single exposure. If the software was told the camera was on a support, it could make several bracketed exposures and not have to clip highlight and shadows.If subsequent releases of the firmware and/or software manage to improve the image quality, the Theta could be a dream come true for anyone interested in panoramas. It is so simple to use that real estate agents could generate their own virtual tours.UsabilityFew experiences in life are more pleasant than running crisp software that is smarter than you are. Conversely, hardly anything is more galling than what I will call arrogant but ignorant software.  Theta app, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.Running the camera remotely from an iOS (and on 29 November, Android, if Ricoh's announcement holds true) app is brilliant if you happen to have an iPod or iPhone. What isn't great is communicating across a public wifi network hosted by the Theta. Initially, this makes sense. Achieving a connection to a known SSID is something that we all know how to do. The password is engraved on the bottom of the camera, invisible to all snoopers except those with a tripod socket fetish. what is inconvenient is what happens when you start using it. For me, the normal workflow is to take a shot or two and then upload them to the internet. This means that you are constantly toggling back and forth between your normal WiFi connection and the Theta connection. The acronym for this condition is PITA. Far better for them to have used an ad hoc connection which can coexist with a standard connection and avoid swapping altogether. I'm not sure, but I think miracast is an example of what I'm talking about.  Also, AppleTV and ChromeCast.Every time you want to upload an image, you have to log onto FaceBook. This is automated, but what if you don't want to be a member?  Tough.Since I first wrote this review, the Android version of the Theta app has come out. It is pretty much a duplicate of the iOS version.  Disappointingly, it omits even the primitive exposure adjustment available in the iOS app.  However, it is much better at assisting the user in swapping between WiFi connections to the Theta and the Internet without leaving the app. It also lets you rapidly shoot pix without transferring them to the Android device or even viewing them. Depending upon your workflow, this is probably an improvement.Prominence of Hands, Tripods, and Other Camera SupportsFor me, this is a non-issue. Basically every frame the Theta exposes is its own selfie. Otherwise, they'd call it something like Theta 359.  If you're holding the camera, at least one hand, foot, mouth, or other body part is going to show up in the image. I prefer to use an unobtrusive support. Along with the camera, I ordered two small tripods, a mini CCTV stand, and a D-ring which screws into the tripod socket and can be used with monofilament. So far, my big favorite is the CCTV stand ( Panavise 845-246W Deluxe Micro Mount (Cream) ). In my opinion, its color and shape blend in nicely with the stub of the camera that inevitably shows up in the image. While it comes with a nice ball head, most tables and suchlike are level enough that I don't need it. There should be a shot of the setup in the product images.CaseThe Theta's body otherwise sleek body is of necessity dominated by two exophtalmic half orbs -- the lenses that together give it the capability to make panoramas.  Ricoh provides a cute but insubstantial case which probably keeps the dust off but offers virtually no drop or shock protection. I think that Ricoh should spring for the couple of bucks a custom Pelican case would cost them. In the meantime, don't be stuffing your Theta in no overhead bins.ConclusionRicoh Pentax joins two companies with a long history of innovation. I am desperately hoping that the shortcomings I've discussed are mostly 1.0 software problems that can be addressed in upcoming releases. The pressures to bring out a product in time for the holidays must be enormous.In the meantime, this pioneering nanoniche camera is a source of endless fascination for me and others afflicted with immersive panorama syndrome. People who are just looking for the occasional panorama would be better and less expensively served by virtually any smartphone.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the first generation, but...", "Author": "Rico", "ReviewID": "ROKX05RE9AXZG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:- Easy to use, little to no setup required.

The camera fits in the palm of your hand and you easily share via the spherical images on the web.Sure, you can get much higher quality panos if you get a DSLR, a fisheye lens, a special panoramic head, a tripod and picture stitching software but the process is long and tedious and requires a commitment in learning the software.(You could do spherical type panoramas with 360 Panorama and Photosynth apps on the iPhone but getting the images to line up perfectly is frustrating unless you get a Youbiq Gymbal)The quality of the images from this camera could be much better, [low light sucks] but it still acceptable to me for what it is. It really depends on your expectations.Pros:Extremely light.One shot operation.Charges via USB.Remote shooting and optional transferring via iPhone. (Always choose COPY and leave the original hi-res photo on the camera for later downloading and retrieval.)Cons:You need a Facebook account to share images via Ricoh's site. BOOO!!Tripod hole threads are plastic.Micro USB Port has a flimsy plastic cover tab which gets in the way.No time delay shutter. (I guess they want you to use the iPhone or Android device).If you shoot directly with the shutter button on the camera, your hand will be prominent. Get a manicure.(It is much better to mount on tripod and step back from camera to shoot.)Terrible picture quality in low light.Other than that, I commend Ricoh for coming out with this camera.

It is VERY portable, it is about the size of a candy bar and slips into your pocket quite well.  It comes with a case to put it in that protects the lens which is a nice extra.  It is extremely easy to use, just turn it on (start up time is instantaneous) and push the big button on the front (or is it the back?), it makes a sound to indicate the picture was taken and that is that.  A neat feature is that you can use a smartphone with the Ricoh Theta app loaded up and after establishing a wifi connection with the camera you can do things like view the photos on your phone, use the phone to trigger the shutter (nice if you want to set the camera somewhere and get a picture without being in the shot) and upload the pictures to social media sites.  The wireless connectivity aspect so far has been flawless and is a real joy to use, some devices that use this sort of interface have issues on a regular basis but this seems to be well implemented which was refreshing.  One can also use the included USB cable to transfer pictures to a computer, this was not automated through the software downloaded from the RIcoh site as I would have expected but was not difficult either.  Overall, the use and the interface with this camera is easy and fairly painless.The pictures this camera takes must be viewed using special software to get the real experience of it.  Sure, you can just load them up on your computer and view them as-is, but they are not a wonder to behold as much as they look like some kind of acid trip.  Viewing them with the special software is really best, and there are a couple options for this.  The novelty is certainly what you are paying for, because the actual image quality is mediocre, akin to the output one might expect from a cellphone camera 4-5 years ago, and drops a bit when the light is dim.  It's adequate and given that this is a very unique type of camera that as far as I am aware does not have an equal at this time, nitpicking the image quality probably isn't all that fair but needs to be mentioned.  This will not produce very high quality images, but honestly it's not as though you would print them or do other things we typically do with images from digital cameras.For the purpose of providing a unique way to share a moment, it's very neat and fun to play with but I do not find it to be exceptionally useful, and the quality output is a bit disappointing but forgivable given the intended purpose of this camera.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "what I needed.", "Author": "Discounted Gentleman", "ReviewID": "RPRIFBX0MPVP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read other reviews and know the picture quality is not as great.

I had made a screenshot to show the image issues but could not post it.  To see how bad this is, please feel free to see... [...] )Received on 12/23 from Amazon, and have to say, while I love the build of the camera itself, it surely is greatly lacking in pixels and image quality one would have expected in this day and age.  Add to that the fact that how poor your software is for the Mac, needing to use iPhoto, a separate program, just to import them so you then can then use the viewer to view them is just plain lazy.Image Size...3584 \u00d7 1792 and is 2.3MB  Yes, that is it!  RIght from the camera and not the image size that was compressed and sent to the phone which then is even worse.  Any new cell phone beats that.  It is as if they went back years in time to make it this bad.  Was this some sort of artistic approach to photos?So I find myself asking, was this rushed out the door for Christmas?  Had to be.  For a company such as this, it clearly is not something someone would expect.  It really has deserved all the poor reviews and I had hoped, when I had seen a new firmware version was released along with being able to embed the image into a website site, that things were going to be much better then the other reviews.  But not by a long shot.  Even the now allowing for embedding the image in a webpage, which was greatly missing in the rush to get it out, comes with a limit of how many you can embed, hint...2. After that you again are taken to there site to view the image getting the ads alongs with it.  Something surely is wrong over there.So I need to ask...Have you just not unlocked all the pixels and power that are inside this or what?  Clearly, the image is poor, you have to know that.  I mean it really does seem like you are doing on purpose or just don't know what you are doing. (Not that I would, but I surely know what one would expect in a $400 camera, and this image quality is NOT it.)  As one member pointed out, BTW, loved the review, it is like you are setting the ISO to some crazy high amount.Please, please tell me you will be making this right and fixing this camera?!?!? The concept is great, the final result and even how you need to get their to be able to see the result, not so much.  This clearly is not what you were intending to release.  I purchased only for I thought you really had maybe fixed the image quality right away through firmware...boy was I wrong.  This will end up going back until such time you correctly fix it and then I may consider trying it again.  (Readers...It is also good to note that YOU MUST have a Facebook account to use this on-line.  You MUST allow them access to post for you and to have access to your friends list.  All this vs just having an account made on their site.)UPDATE 1/17/14 ---I have returned this camera.  NO REPLIES from the company ever came to any of my concerns or questions.  As such...NO SUPPORT.  Such a shame for such a good idea.  Fix the image quality and lower the price and maybe you will have a better chance with the sale of this camera.
