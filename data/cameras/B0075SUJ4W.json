{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great pictures....but I expected more", "Author": "D. Gutterud \"SDave\"", "ReviewID": "R3M91Z5HOAMVIM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on prior experience with ELPHs and a raving review from the salesperson in the store.  I wish I would have done some research before buying but I had left my other camera in my office and needed to take some photos on a jobsite 4 hours from home.I'll start by saying that it does, for the most part, take very good looking photos in pretty much any situation and in any light.  The zoom is great and the stabilization is actually very good even when zoomed in.  I rarely get fuzzy or out-of-focus shots with this camera.  And the focus is very fast and usually pretty accurate.I actually really like the screen.  It's nice and big and I thought the touchscreen was great once I figured it out.  I will admit that the menus are not set up the way I would have done it but now I kind of know where to go and it works fine.  No, it is not an iPhone/iPad like screen but I think it works well.  If the menu system/software was more intuitive it would be a great way to control the camera.My favorite thing about the touchscreen is moving the focus...one tap and the focus point for the camera can be changed.  Very convenient.I also really like the size and weight - it is small but not too small.  Yes, it is heavier than a lot of cameras in this class but it feels solid and well built.  I like the overall feel.I also like the HDMI out.  This thing takes pretty good videos (including iframe) and the HDMI out is great for sharing them quickly.Now, things I don't like:1) I hate how the photo playback is set up.  It is way more difficult than it should be...especially considering that this is a touch screen.2) Battery life sucks...especially if you want to use WiFi.  If you are going to change to a new style battery why not make it one that packs some power.  These little canisters suck.3) WiFi is a waste of time, battery life and money.  Transfer is PAINFULLY slow and unless you have your camera plugged in you are going to drain your battery by the time the photos are uploaded.  So why have a wireless transfer if you have to plug in for power?  I'll be pulling the card and using my card reader....every time.4) I hate where they put the view photos button..right next to the power button.  Stupid.5) No easy way to force a flash.  You can disable the flash in two taps but there is no easy way to force a flash.  That should be a one step option.  Even \"low light\" setting doesn't automatically force a flash or give you an option for one.6)  There are many nice \"shooting modes\" but you can't combine them.  So if you want to do more than one thing you have to go in a manually program.  The \"Smart Auto\" is actually very good for most situations but when you need to do something special it can take a couple of minutes to get it set up.7) Price.  If this camera worked as well as the marketing materials says it does than the price would be fine.  However, I don't think it lives up to it's billing and, accordingly, is not worth the extra money.Will I keep it?  Yes, because I was too lazy to take it back within the 30 days and because I am now used to it.  The pictures and videos are very good but I still find myself cursing at the camera at least once during each use.Would I buy it again if I could start over?  No.Edit: I bought this camera when it first came out and was $300.00.  At $130.00 this camera is obviously a much better deal.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly the compact camera I've been looking for", "Author": "T. Sheridan", "ReviewID": "RHF3KEPDR1SMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a good compact camera for a long time. I am an amateur photographer with a Canon 5D and wanted a small camera I could have with me without the weight of the 5D. Any compact I tried suffered from poor quality photos or very slow responsiveness. The time from pressing the shutter release to actual capture of the photo was my biggest issue with using a compact camera for `snapshots.' If I was just trying to capture a moment at a party, the compact's delay was always an issue. So I was stuck with carrying the giant 5D everywhere or missing out on some photo opportunities.The ELPH 530 HS has completely filled my requirements. I spent a few days wandering around my house and yard with both cameras and taking the same shots. The quality of the 530 was almost always up to that of the 5D. The automatic settings are excellent, and even in some tricky backlit situations made the right call on exposure. The only situation where the 5D beat the 530 (but not by much) was in very low light, non-flash situations. So when I'm taking photos in dark churches I will still rely on the 5D, but on almost every other situation the 530 will do nicely.I did not think I would use any of the special effects on the camera but quickly found some useful. When at a dance competition for my daughter I was able to use the color filter function to snap B&W; photos where one color is left in. This was great for shots that made the red of their outfits pop in a sea of gray. I could have done this with the 5D, but would have needed to load the photo on my PC and do some work in photoshop. Instead I had the photos on Facebook within a minute of taking them.That's the other main reason I chose this camera over some others I was looking at, such as the Canon S100 - it has built-in wifi. And it works really well with my iPhone which was my hope for future vacation photos sent from anywhere to friends or posted to Facebook without needing to lug a laptop around. I have not tried the other connections possible from the 530, such as your home wifi to a folder on your pc or to the Canon sharing site. I wanted to be able to get the images to my phone and do what I wanted with them and this works perfectly. When I am home I pop the card into a reader on my PC so I don't see a need to use the home wifi. It seems you need to choose the images individually to save them to your iPhone, but as that is what I normally do I haven't tried to do anything else, such as `send all photos to my iPhone.'The one negative I noticed in other reviews is battery life, and from the perspective of the 5D DSLR, it's very short. I can go all day with the 5D on a single battery, shooting 1,000 images and not thinking about it. Of course I have spares for that camera and cycle them through the charger when on a vacation. The literature states 500-600 photos on a charge and after a full day of shooting that is probably about right. I purchased a pair of third party batteries on Amazon fairly cheaply and they seem fine.I rarely shoot any video and haven't tried it on the 530, but it's there and in HD.In a direct comparison to a DSLR like the 5D the 530 would hold up fairly well in my opinion in most aspects. Of course the reason to use a DSLR is to have control over the exposure and the 530 has limited `modes' rather than a method to set the exposure directly. The Canon S100 had this ability and I nearly bought it for that reason, intending to add a wifi memory card. When I thought about my true reason for a compact camera, the ability to have a quality camera with me at all times to capture everyday shots, I realized I did not need the control of the S100. For over $100 less the 530 seemed a good buy. Since the 530 includes wifi, that made the s100 another $80 more expensive as I'd have to add it.The only feature I could think of that the 530 was missing is a GPS function that records the location of images. That would have been nice, and some compacts have that, but it wasn't a deal-breaker for me.So, after about a month of trying it in a number of situations I am very pleased with the 530. The camera works as I hoped and the wifi and software for transfer to my iphone work well. I gave up on the image-browser software for the PC as I still use an old version of Canon zoombrowser to transfer to my PC. Imagebrowser seemed very slow as it tried to organize the thousands of image son my PC.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stylish point and shoot camera with great touchscreen and wifi features", "Author": "TMB", "ReviewID": "R3G227BONRIQZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't understand the negative reviews for this camera. I did a lot of research and what appealed to me the most were 1) the size of the camera: it's so compact it fits nicely in my purse or pocket and I had no trouble finding a little case for it. 2) the touchscreen feature: not sure what everyone is complaining about, the touchscreen works great, similar to my iPhone and iPad and a child could figure it out. It's very very simple. You just touch the screen to select what you want and you can cycle through your photos as easily as you can on a smartphone. 3) the wifi option: when I read so many reviews bashing the wifi I was a little skeptical. The good news is that I got the wifi working in 15 minutes. The better news is that I was able to transfer my images onto my iPhone and ipad without needing to use a wifi connection or any cords. There is an Ad Hoc feature that allows you to transfer the photos without the camera or iPhone/iPad being connected to a wifi network. It sort of works like a bluetooth. I was able to transfer images in the car on a long drive back home. No cords, no internet connection.Some other negative points that I've read online have to do with the short battery life and the miniSD card. I have found that neither of these things are an issue. When the battery has gotten low I charge it. It hasn't died on me after a long day of use...so I have no complaints there. The miniSD card is a non issue. I bought an 8GB card for the same price I would have spent on a regular SD card ($12.99). My miniSD came with a full size SD adapter if I needed it, but because of the handy Wifi/Ad Hoc transfer capabilities I never have to take the card out or plug the camera in to transfer my photos.I got this camera so that as a new mom I could take better photos than I do with my smartphone, but I also wanted to be able to share them with other with little or no effort. The images are crisp and clear and the colors are vibrant. I also love the cute/retro boxy look and in matte white the little camera is a unique beauty. I love everything about it and it's yet to disappoint. The macro pictures are amazing as well.I was able to nab this at $199 and for the reasons listed above its way better than some of the other cameras out there at that price point. My mom just got a Nikon and it takes beautiful pics as well but has no touchscreen and no wifi.

If you like the camera, and do not like the touch screen or the wifi part, there is the Canon Elph 520: Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS 10.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full HD Video Recording (Black). It looks like the same camera as the 530 but without the wifi and touch screen. The 520 is a little cheaper. I am not sure if there are any other differences though. I returned my ELPH 530. However...I just bought the new Panasonic ZS20 which is cheaper than this camera as of this writing, and offers so much more. 20x zoom just to mention one thing.

I have had a new canon camera every year for the past 10 years or so and I was apprehensive of the touch screen.  i had a previous model and didn't like it because of the touch screen.  This one is very usable.  It isn't iOS quality but its pretty decent,  The one problem I noticed immediately is that the on/off button is right next to the view photos button.  I just got the camera and I noticed I am mixing them up and pressing the wrong one often,  I am sure after time I will get this straight but it seems silly to have put them right next to one another.  The size of the camera is really good.  Smallest canon I have had in a while.  People who are complaining about white - buy black - I did.  I wouldn't touch a white camera - ever.  It is going to get dirty.  I don't know if the white one will clean up but it is irrelevant to me.  I don't have white carpet in my house it just won't stay clean.  I am working with the iOS app which is cool but I couldn't get my iPhone and the camera to communicate over the established wifi network.  When it fails you have to re-enter the wifi password- really really bad.  Anyway I connected the camera to the phone with an ad hoc network and I could transfer pictures.  Now the killer: it seems to drain battery quite a bit and if you wanted to select a bunch of pictures you have to select them individually.  I have a 32gig card in this thing and it would take absolutely forever!  I had an eyefi card in my other camera and it was great.  I had high hopes for this wifi system but so far I don't see this as a direct replacement.  I upload my pictures currently to a gallery2 server.

The touch screen and image compression needs work", "Author": "Robert Adams", "ReviewID": "RES15NZVZEBHZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like having a point-and-shoot camera on hand because I find my phone doesn't really replace a real camera. I've had previous versions of PowerShot cameras and, when my last died, I researched around and this camera looked and ideal replacement. Sadly, I returned the camera after a week of testing.I love the chassis. It is small and easy to carry while packing the great optics and the large rear screen. I've always thought a full touch screen would a good design and was excited when I found this design. The packaging of this camera is its best feature.That said, as other reviews have mentioned, the touch screen is slow, unresponsive, and hard to operate. While, on a phone, a quick swipe would change pictures or a touch and drag would change exposure values, this touch panel needs to be firmly touched in just the right place and swiped in just the right way to do its operation. I would suspect that Canon needs to get someone who has done a phone touch screen stack to redo this screen's operation. As it stands, this one is hard to operate.The thing that really lead to two stars, though, is the picture quality. All my pictures seemed fuzzy. I figured I was doing something wrong but after looking and tweaking I believe the JPEG compression or something is just too aggressive. There is no raw picture save mode so everything must be saved as compressed JPEG and, even with the 'super fine' setting, compression artifacts make sky, clouds, flat backgrounds -- things that should be an even color -- fuzzy with a mess of color variation. Edges are not alpha shaded but jaggy with color edge reflections. The problem is aggravated by Canon's choice of not allowing 'super fine' mode when in 'auto' -- it is available in 'program' mode but is not when 'auto'.This picture quality complaint was not reported in other reviews. Maybe my particular purchase was defective or something. I don't know but I'm reporting what I found and why I returned this camera.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch screen functions are a little difficult to learn", "Author": "James L. Davis", "ReviewID": "RMN0MB4QR05AZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a few weeks, and it took some time to learn how to use it. The touch screen functions are quite different from the usual switches, but I am getting used to it. You have to touch the screen fairly hard to select a function, but that is better than being too sensitive.The touch screen appearance is great, and you can see it outdoors, but not with the sun directly on it.A few of my pictures have had poor color, but most are excellent. I believe the poor color has happened when I pushed the button too fast and didn't pause at the halfway position long enough for the software to get the settings right. One evening I shot several pictures indoors with Auto setting, and the automatic flash came on about half the time. On the pictures without flash, the ASA figure went higher. That made the pictures a bit inconsistent for a single event, but almost all were very good.Video is great, and you can zoom while you are shooting. The only video problem I have seen is the stability of the camera. It is so small and lightweight that it is hard to get a good, steady video.I have used the wireless transfer two ways. One way is to transfer through my wireless router. In that case, you connect the camera to the router, and the router is connected to the PC. Another way is to connect directly between the camera and the PC. That works ok, but you have to disconnect the PC from any other wireless, and connect directly to the camera. These connections are both straightforward when you realize there are two ways to connect. It took me a while to realize there are two ways, and not to confuse them. I also set up the camera to transfer to the Canon Image Gateway, a cloud storage service, and that works very well; it does not take long.The battery is small and doesn't last long for wireless transfer, and it may not last long for video, but I haven't shot that much video. I bought a second battery and I alternate batteries, recharging one or both when I am home.I gave the camera only four stars because of the touch screen difficulties and the few pictures that are somewhat off color.

As a person who started using touch screens from the Palm Pilot era, I have seen planty of worse screens. The touch screen on this camera is actually not that bad. The problem is that Canon just re-uses its regular camera menu system, which was not designed for touch screen. The small icons and arrows definitely make the menu hard to use. However, I think most of the owners will use this camera as a pure point-and-shoot. The touch screen usage should be minimum.Setting up Wi-Fi to connect to iPad takes no time. Connecting to PC is another story. There are many steps that you have to follow and some of them are too technical for most users. To be fair, it is really  Microsoft's fault. Canon does provide detailed step-by-step instructions. Transferring images over Wi-Fi is not fast. It is OK for 10 or 20 pictures. For anything more than that, I would use my card reader. BTW, I do not mind MicroSD card. All our phones use MicroSD cards anyway.So for me, touch screen and Wi-Fi are not the problems. But thanks to all the complains, the price of this camera has dropped dramatically. I pulled the trigger when I saw the price dropped to less than 50% of the MSRP.To achieve the 12x optical zoom in such a small camera, Canon only utilizes 10 MP of the 16 MP sensor (the same idea as Panasonic's extended optical zoom). It means this particular camera uses a even smaller sensor than already small sensor. Because of that, the image quality is not as good as other ELPH cameras. The battery life is not great either. But it could be because I was playing Wi-Fi extensively.I bought this camera for my daughter but I am sure I will use it often too. It is very stylish. The picture quality is not the best, but still good. It has tons of features, but you do not have to use them. Extra battery only costs several dollars. Overall, I am happy with this small camera, especially for the price.[One month ownship follow up:]After the initial \"warm up\", I only took this camera out twice. The noise level is higher than I would like to see. And the detail level is lower than I would like to see. But the color is very good. As long as we do not view the pictures in pixel level, we should be fine.I was taking some pictures and posting them on internet last night. I have been using memory card readers ever since I started using digital cameras. But taking the small microSD card in and out was a little annoying. Then, I realized this camera has Wi-Fi. No wire no reader, nothing to plug or un-plug, just turn on the Wi-Fi and connect to my computer. The camera appeared on my computer as an extra drive. And I could access all my pictures from there! You have to use this feature to appreciate it.[Another thought]Small image sensor can really impact the image quality and low light performance. This camera's effective sensor is 40% smaller than the Canon's smallest sensor. That certainly will not help. If you still want a ELPH camera, do not care about the block style, do not care about the touch screen, the newly released ELPH 330 HS may be your best choice. It is slightly bigger but lighter than 530 HS. It has an improved Wi-Fi. It does not have touch screen and uses a larger battery. But the most important, the 330 HS uses a full 1/2.3-inch sensor.

I selected this camera for its wifi capabilities but I have not been able to get it to work. I'm pretty tech-savy, so its definitely not an easy step by step process. In my research so far, I believe it requires installation of software on the computer and setting it up through there, but that hasn't worked yet.  The battery is different than many of the other powershot cameras - this one uses the provided nb-9l.  The touch screen took some getting used to, but works ok.  The flash options are auto and off.
