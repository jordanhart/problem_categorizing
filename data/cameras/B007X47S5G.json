I bought this thinking maybe it was too good to be true, too cheap for all that it had. But it turned out awesome! I have taken this camera to a lot of places and taken excellent pictures at night, as well as day.The image quality (even in ISO as high as 1600) is excellent! Every single item in this package has been worth the money. I am really happy with my purchase, I haven't had a chance to try out the remote control tho. I would recommend it to anyone really!", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$684.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> PD DSLR Sling Backpack + <5> Zeikos 52mm Hard Lens Hood + <6> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> Additional Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <8> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <9> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> PD Spudz Microfiber Cloth + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 55-200mm VR Lens + 32GB Card + Backpack + Filters + Remote + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hlfbg43gL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007X47S5G"}}
