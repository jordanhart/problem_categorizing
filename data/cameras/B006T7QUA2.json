Yes, moisture gets into the camera. I notice water around the seals of the battery/memory card compartment, and sometimes behind the view screen. I've never had water in the lens assembly though. The camera is still functioning perfectly and taking outstanding pictures and videos. Some of the videos were so breathtaking I wanted to watch them on my 42\" HDTV, so, I ordered the HDMI cables to connect the camera to the TV. At first I was so disappointed because all the camera information that you see during playback on the camera was also on the TV screen, and it was SO BIG that it obscured a lot of the picture and was extremely annoying. The instruction manual was no help, and I got no answer from Fujifilm when I sent them an email asking if there were a way to turn the useless camera data off. I finally played with all the buttons and found that after you connect the camera to the TV and turn the camera & TV on, push the Disp/Back button and it will take you to a screen on the TV where you can turn the Information feature off. Problem solved and I am a happy camper...or should I say a happy snorkeler. For now, I am storing the camera when it is not in use in a plastic bag with a couple of packets of those moisture absorbing silica beads and every so often will treat the rubber seals around the battery chamber with silicone grease (very carefully and sparingly) and hope the camera continues to record wonderful underwater experiences.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mixed feelings", "Author": "Min-Hong A Hsu", "ReviewID": "R3H1BLQO6GFH57", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was surprised there was not much review on this model a week ago.It was right before my school fieldtrip to Catalina Island.  Between Go Pro and other waterproof cameras, I was reading reviews on several models, and decided to give this XP100 a shot.Since there was almost none reviews on this new series (XP50, XP100, XP150), I was reading reviews for previous models (XP10, XP30) and hoping Fuji would make some improvements.My major concern was the battery life. Many older reviews mentioned that the model with GPS feature would drain your batteries, and XP50 comes with a battery that allows you to take around 222 shots.  So I decided to choose XP100 which is the one does not have GPS (which I don't need it and won't kill my battery too soon) and has a longer battery life (around 333 shots per cycle, please check offical website for detail).The second concern was the waterproofing feature.  Many reviews indicate this series doesn't do very well in waterproofing.  So when I first got into the ocean, I was not sure if it is really waterproof.  The result was, it survived the first two snorkelling and one kayaking.  I was able to take photos and vedios in the water, and everything was okay after four days of use.  The only thing I notice was when I open the battery door, there was some moist inside the compartment where the seal was when it's colsed, but the top of the SD slot and battary were dry.  I did not expect that but the camera has been okay.But funny thing started to happen on my last day of the trip on the island.  It was a sunny day, and after half hour of shooting vedios on land, I found moist inside the monitor and lens.  It took me a while to let the moist dry out so they are not affecting my shooting.  I had to let it sit under the sun to speed up the evaporation.I like the quality of the HD video, maybe because this is my first camera that can take HD videos, especially when I was shooting videos outdoors under the sun most of the time.  Underwater videos are clear enough and battery seemed to last longer than I expected.  I went on a 30 - 40 minutes snorkelling and kept shooting vedios.  The battery showed low at the end but it still took videos for a while.  When switched back to camera mode, it actually could still take a lot of photos.And as other reviews mentioned, this camera does good job outdoors with good lighting.  I did have several good photos outdoors, but when it is dark such as indoors or at night, you don't expect it will do a good job.For me, this camera served the purpose because I needed it to take photos of my students doing water sports and outdoor activities. I probably won't use it too often in the water but I don't need to worry about it getting wet in the rain and get damaged if my students dropped it.  This will be my class camera in the future, but not for myself.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved the Fujifil FinePix XP100", "Author": "Rene Edwards", "ReviewID": "RJ7Y1LG3OJSQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for a 7 trip to Grand Cayman.  I was a little cautious because some of the reviews indicated that water got into the camera.  Given the features and the price, we thought we'd give it a try.  We ended up absolutely loving this camera.  My Canon Powershot died mid way through the trip so this became our primary \"everyday\" camera. We used it both in the water and out.We did lots of snorkeliing and I thought the pictures under water were great.  They weren't professional grade of course but the best underwater pictures we have taken.  (We've tried an underwater film camera and a putting our digital camera in a special underwater camerat bag).  The underwater video was also great.  The camera was easy to use underwater - in all aspects - easy to turn on, easy to focus, easy to video.We also used the camera out of the water.  On several occasions we took sunset pictures with both my Canon Rebel and Fujifilm FinePix XP100.  The coloring was very similar.  It did a great job of capturing the beautiful hues of the sunset and the amazing colors of the ocean waters.We never had any trouble with getting water inside the camera.  It has a special sensor that alerts you if you don't get the battery cover closed properly.  There are 2 latches and both must be closed securely before it will let you take a picture.I highly recommend this camera for the money!!", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is not reliably waterproof.", "Author": "SE Gatz", "ReviewID": "R17KWNFK4KQETW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera despite some of the bad comments about it failing to resist water.  I took it snorkeling for a day, never exceeding 5 feet in depth and it worked fine.  A couple of days later I had it in a kayak barely in the water (sitting in the cupholder while I was moving) and while recording video I accidentally turned the unit off.  It would not turn on again.  When I got into the hotel room I opened it to find water in the batter/memory compartment.  I know, because I was cautious based on the reviews I had read, that Fuji would claim negligence on the operator that I had closed both of the latches.  As a design engineer I respected their position so was very cautious.  Note that the label for the latches comes off when wet.  Fortunately, I also purchased the warranty, I'll have to see how the return/replacement process goes.

I took this to my trip to Hawaii and was pleased with the photos and videos it took while snorkeling. Just be aware that you need plenty of light and CLEAR water. Even if the water is a little bit cloudy you won't be able to capture subjects more then 1 ft away. I think this is true of most underwater photography, however. The beach mode was good at keeping photos from being washed out from bright sand in the background and the sunset mode created a cool effect for some sunset beach photos I took in Waikiki. The only thing I would improve is to have some kind of cover for the lens shield. I'm paranoid that It'll get scratched and ruin every photo.

After all, the Olympus was 7.1mp while the Fuji was 14mp, sensor technology has improved, meaning lower noise, and better lenses are being designed into more modern cameras, to compliment the better sensors.The XP-100 has none of that, and the old Olympus made images with far better overall quality.My main disappointment is the heavy handed, and non-adjustable, softening from the use of noise reduction.  There is an almost \"painted\" effect.  Solid blotches of color, where fine detail ought to be.  This occurs even at ISO 100, right through ISO 3200 (which you'd expect).So, potential purchasers are reminded - its not the number of pixels, but the QUALITY of the pixels that matter.The Fuji XP-100 is lacking in that regard.But for some good points too....Even with mediocre image quality due to noise reduction softening, the lens does very well for itself.  The exposures I've made have all been well exposed.  I've used the camera in low light without flash, and with flash, and exposures are better than I expected.  There is a super-automatic mode that works amazingly well, controlling face detection (or not), macro (or not), flash (or not) and even choosing a specialized \"scene mode\" for the user, as it sees fit.  This feature does in fact work very well, but does use up the battery just a little more due to face detection hunting.  If you don't need to stretch the battery life, this is a nice feature for folks who don't really want to fiddle with things, but just get a focused, well exposed, snapshot.One feature I like too, is that the XP-100 allows you to take B&W; or Sepia shots continuously, without having to convert each one after the fact (something the Olympus didn't do).  The macro mode is very nice, but sometimes doesn't focus well - even if you're within range.  Its not a \"super macro\" but gets the job done for objects about the size of a men's wrist watch (or slightly larger).The movies are also amazingly nice.  I'm not a big fan of movie clips from small cameras, but the few clips I made as experiements were well exposed, \"ok\" in sharpness and focus, and clear and snappy looking.  I also tried shooting a test clip at a distant scene then panning to a close up object, and the camera tracked the focus perfectly.  I like that!There are reports abounding of underwater failures from the XP line of Fuji cameras.  I do not plan on taking my camera underwater.  Instead, I got it (like I got the Olympus) so I could take it motorcycling (rain use), or use it for work (wet, but not submerged conditions).  At the beach, getting wet or sandy should be no problem, except that sand IS scratchy to lenses and displays.Speaking of which - the display is nice and bright, one of the better ones.  None are great outdoors, but the Fuji XP-100 does well in that regard, when compared to any other small camera or phone I'd used, or even pro level Canon SLR cameras I've used.  There is also a display brightness booster button on top of the camera, handy!  The display is very detailed as well.There are nice features, and good build quality (it feels solid too), but cameras are all about image.  Thats why we get them.  The images produced from the Fuji XP-100 are sub-par for cameras using today's technology.  They are only a step above the images from my LG Android phone, and thats why its getting a two star rating.  Image quality of this level should be from a $59 camera.I'll be keeping the XP-100.  I'm not going to hassle with returning it.

There aren't too many options out there for water proof cameras that take 1080p video and has large LCD viewfinders, all for under $180.The battery life is excellent. During my 7 day trip, it never ran out on me during the middle of the day and I took plenty of pictures and videos.I went snorkeling and kayaking on 3 separate occasions and took the camera down maybe 6 ft under water, banged it on corrals a few times by accident, left some scratches on both the plastic and metal exterior, but there were no leak or moisture inside the lens, LCD, or the battery compartment. At the end of the day I just soak and rinse the camera in tap water as instructed in the manual.The picture quality isn't great, some of the pictures actually look no better than pictures I took with my cellphone. But I kind was expecting it so it wasn't too big a let down.It also lacks manual adjustment to things like shutter speed, exposure time, or white balance. But it does provide quite a lot automatic moods, ranging from panorama mode where you can specify field of view and just scan the scenery on the fly (useful), to several underwater video mode (decent), to taking self portrait of 2+ people based on proximity of faces using face recognition (funny but doesn't work well).Minus 1 star for the unspectacular picture quality and lack of manual settings, 4 stars for the toughness and the price.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied with performance", "Author": "Barton Zweigoron", "ReviewID": "R3D625O81ESJVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this item on impulse before a week long whitewater kayaking trip that I wanted to document and have been pleasantly surprised with how well its worked for that purpose.The camera got clipped into a pocket in my life jacket and I would pull it out at the base of a rapid to take pictures of my friends as they came though. During the week it spent a significant amount of time submerged as well as taking a couple decent bumps off or rocks or boats as I scrambled around trying to get a better vantage point and was no worse for the wear from it.The camera would turn on and be ready to take pictures in just a few seconds so I did not miss many moments due to warm up time and the lens handled me hastily wiping the water off it with a finger or shirt sleeve without leaving obvious water smears on the photos.Some pictures did come out blurred, but I think that's unavoidable given the circumstances of shooting from a small boat in choppy water. The large majority of the photos turned out acceptably crisp and of acceptable quality.I am not giving it five stars as it does not take quite as high quality pictures as other (slightly more expensive) point and clicks that I have used in more traditional environments, but I think that the tradeoff in image quality for durability in extreme environments and affordable price point is well justified.As an inexpensive point-and-click that you can be rough with I think this camera works exactly as advertised.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "XP100 Camera", "Author": "Joe Cangiolosi", "ReviewID": "RTVJ61C86A2A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased with the camera, bought 3 and use them in a plant.  the guys like it a lot.

Yes, the battery will run out, but with the cost of replacement batteries so low, I use one battery per quarter and keep shooting while others with traditional video cameras must look for a place to plug in and will head inside and shoot lesser-quality footage in bad weather.The 5X zoom is not optimal for regular photography but it's good enough to cover the field from side to side.  I've seen better HD quality but it isn't bad and certainly good enough to use for the game \"film.\"It's pretty small so to make it easier to use, I place it on a monopod so I can hold it steady with my left hand and not be concerned that I'll block the lens which is off to the left side.For what I need from a camera, for the price, this was perfect.

I hope the waterproof feature is robust, i.e. actually works..for snorlking, for example. This camera should float, too, but it's heavy. As we say in sea kayaking, if it doesn't float, it's not your friend. Lose control over the camera while swimming and it'll sink to the bottom and that will quickly overwhelm the seal. If it's sealed it should be sealed in such a way that the seal gets stronger the more water pressure it gets, not less strong. Going into the menu to get that darned flash turned off is a nuisance. When I want the flash off, I want it OFF! NOW! Not some remote time in the future when I've gone through the d***** menu. And i want it to stay off until the next time I want it on. I love the color.

They would only replace with a refurbished model, did not have an orange one, and wouldn't pay the return shipping to overnight it, so that cost me $15. They offered to send me some accessories instead, but then didn't send them, probably because I complained too much. On the plus side, the pictures were pretty good, including underwater ones.
