The Mark iii far exceeded all my expectations and was worth every penny.  You get what you pay for and this camera is worth it.

Very very happy with this camera-highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a great price", "Author": "CJeff65", "ReviewID": "RXJIW477690SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best price found for this camera and accessories.
