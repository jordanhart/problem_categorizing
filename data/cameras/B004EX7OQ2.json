I purchased the complete 4-Camera QSee Package from a local store in Trinidad, after 10 months two cameras failed. The option to return only the cameras was not available from the supplier, and it was too much of a hassle to pull down all the wiring to return the entire unit. So, I chose to buy two replacement cameras at Amazon.The replacement of the defective cameras were a snap, and I must add that the picture quality of the ones I bought were far better than the ones originally supplied. But here I am after 16 months writing a (poor) review of their life - kaput goes another camera!I would not recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about a camera system. It is cheaper the most other security systems and that is exactly what it is ... cheap!I give 2 stars - one for each year of service!", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "night vision was poor without additional lightning", "Author": "Joe Swafford", "ReviewID": "R16LH8HNR51RVZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "with secondary lighting it is still grainy at 15'... had to upgrade cameras to 100' infared to get the coverage i was looking for", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Todd Wax", "ReviewID": "R28NTTH7ADIAE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "these cameras work great both day and night. easy to install. would definately recommend purchase and would by again if i need more", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like!!", "Author": "rrader", "ReviewID": "RN76UEY74FQXC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera's for what I needed them for!!

I really did not think having wired cameras would be much of an issue. I was so wrong! Wired cameras are such a headache to install and do not offer the versatility of a wireless camera and though these cameras come with 60 ft of wiring... for my house that was not near enough. Moreover, the picture quality was not what I would call high quality and the night vision was disappointing as well. Needless to say, if you are looking for inexpensive cameras with sub-par video quality for the sake of perhaps deterring a potential criminal then these are the way to go. If you want a security system that creates a picture or video where you can actually identify all in it, this is not the camera for you.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See cameras", "Author": "Tim Miller", "ReviewID": "RHG81I8LXJ96L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The color on these cameras are better than the ones that I had gotten from Comp USA in the 4 pack set a year earlier, but after it gets dark the cameras get distorted and are harder to see a clear image on.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "after a year, my 5 cams are trouble free", "Author": "Norman Cutter \"alyosha10\"", "ReviewID": "RF7Z1H3EBW9AA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I installed these cams over a year ago in my small business, and all are working perfectly.
