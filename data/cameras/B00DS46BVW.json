{"Reviews": [{"Title": "To A65 or to A55? That is the Question..", "Author": "Alex Parker", "ReviewID": "RXGCXUXBLFUIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony A55 vs. A65: is Newer Really Better?When Sony released info on the Nex-5N, NEX-7, a65 and a77 models, I decided that the technological leaps on the new line was enough to make me a believer. What really put me into the Sony system over Canon and Nikon was the lower price points on the Sony lenses. Yeah, they don't have as many lenses as the Big Two, but I don't know any photographers with 25+ lenses in their closet, either. The NEX-5N looked nice but I like viewfinders and didn't want to be gouged on that accessory. The NEX-7--while pricey--still doesn't have a release date. The a65 was priced below the a77 by almost $500, so that was a no-brainer, but was it $200-worth more than the a55, a camera that--for the most part--touts a devout ownership?I actually bought the a65 and the a55 at the same time, opting for the a65 because of its corrected overheating issue while filming video (the tie-breaker for many) and the a55 because, aside from the overheating issue (a \"logical\" deal-breaker for many with the arrival of the a65), it offers just about everything else the a65 does, minus some cosmetic differences and a handful of megapixels most of us will never use or need.First, the differences. The a65's swivel LCD is a nice little touch over the a55's traditional vertical flip-out. With the rotating swivel I was able to take shots by holding the camera down low and high over my head. The LCD view on this unit is crystal clear. The electronic viewfinder on the a65 is superior to the a55. (**I'm not going to get into the differences between the OVF and Sony's EVF; if you are reading this, it's because you're either used to EVFs in general, don't mind them, or think Sony cameras are cool, regardless.) The EVF here offers a FULL view of my shots. Also, if you use the EVF instead of the LCD, there is a level meter that basically tells you if your shot is in focus, and if your horizon/vanishing points are perfectly level; this is invaluable if you're taking landscape or wide shots. When shooting people it eventually recognizes redundant faces and will instantly articulate in on the principle person you're shooting automatically if they are in a crowd or shot with multiple people; this I also found to be a rather nice innovation and would be tremendous if I were shooting a wedding and only cared about the bride, for example. The thing that I liked most about the a65 over the a55 however was completely unexpected: on the a65 there is a dedicated ISO button next to the aperture/shutter wheel, and next to it is a dedicated exposure button that will give you accurate adjustments in the EVF before you shoot. AWESOME. After a couple hours of shooting with this unit I could easily toggle between the Aperture, ISO and exposure intuitively by simply moving my finger slightly from one button to the next. In this regard, making on the fly adjustments while shooting on the street was a snap.One cosmetic/function quirk that really bugged me on the a65: the frame-zoom button is in a weird place. Located in the top right behind the wheel and shutter button, I kept hitting it by accident and it was quite annoying. I also didn't like how it basically took me a day and a half to 1) find the playback function for video and 2) toggle back and forth between video and regular picture playback mode. After two days I still didn't know how to download the video off of the card. It was like Easter egg hunting! Also, some of the novelty shooting camera modes looked like fun when I first powered up, but I quickly realised that the shooting potential of this camera was so great that I'd actually be doing a disservice by being too cute with the toy functions. The regular shooting and BW modes were all I truly needed to get really impressive results.The a55 by contrast shoots just a clip slower\u00ac\u00ac--though the AF is just as snappy--with little discernable difference, unless you put the camera in review mode to look at shots after you take them, then it sorta bricks out for longer seconds than its successor. (**On the a65 the review mode is default to OFF.) The a55 is also decidedly lighter in weight. I will note that because I have egregiously long fingers, it was actually a less comfortable handle than the a65, and I almost felt like the two models are specifically tailored to different hand-types. Actually, this is a BIG DEAL if you don't care about cute functions: if you have little hands and generally prefer light equipment, the a55 (at $200 less I remind you) carries more value in day-to-day carrying and shooting. If you have bigger hands, the a65 is an absolute must, you will thank me later.Finally, the video mode. On the a65 the quality on the 60i is far superior to anything I've ever seen on a DSLR, hands down. I actually wanted the a65 because it shot in \"cinematic\" 24p, but I can attest that compared to the 60i on this unit it left a lot to be desired. If you are mulling the a65 specifically because it has a 24p option, do yourself a favour, save your money and get the a55, just trust me on this. One more thing on the video: I know some (well, a LOT) of a55 users have complained about the sensors overheating at about 5-10 continuous minutes of filming. When I tested the a55 out of the box (it was the first thing I tested, actually), the camera copped out at just over 8 minutes at room temperature. I ran the same test on the a65 and made it nearly 20 minutes without any issues whatsoever. That being said, this is an SLT/DSLR-type camera. You should know that it is extremely UNSATISFYING to hold an SLT/DSLR camera to shoot video for more than a couple of minutes, period. In that sense and in retrospect, the 5-10 cap on the a55 seems pretty negligible. Honestly, if you are leaning towards the a65 only for its longer shooting time capability, don't. Unless you're currently trying to get 15+ minutes of continuous film out of your DSLR (and really, you shouldn't be), the video capabilities and shortcomings between the two units should be the least of your worries.Finally, a lot has been said about Sony's poor performance at high ISO levels. Indeed, on the a65 when I shot a band performing in a club the background noise left a lot to be desired past 1600. On rendering the blurs and noise actually turned to mud and many of those photos were simply unusable. I did not test the a55 in this regard; I feel if having a great performer at super high ISOs is your thing, Nikon is probably way to go. (**I REALLY wished this a65 performed better here.)All this being said, the a65 is a winner over the a55 in every category if money is not an issue. If money IS an issue, or if you want to get more bang for your buck, the a55 body-only plus a better-than-kit lens will give you awesome value and you won't be missing anything it doesn't offer over the a65 if your only concern is taking fantastic pictures. In doing a side by side comparison of well-lit indoor shots using the same 35mm 1.8 lens stopped down to f2, the a55 curiously produced sharper photos, while the white balance on the a65 appeared to be slightly more neutral. My reaction: Huh . . .So what did I pick? Ultimately, I went with the a65. Really, the ISO button and ergonomical fit for my big hands were the things that really swayed me. I shot on both cams at 12MP so I didn't get full reso use out of either body. But I had to ask myself: Is the ISO button alone worth $200? Absolutely not. But the a65 fitting better in my bigger hands, that was worth $200. That won't be worth $200 to everybody. If you have smaller or normal-sized hands and just want top notch performance and super sharp pictures the a55 is a sneaky good pickup. You can always fix balance in post.***UPDATE***This cannot be overstated, but if want to get a nice and cheap prime lens, I HIGHLY recommend the Sony 35mm1.8f. It is the 50mm equivilent on the A65 (if you buy the 50mm your shots will be too tight to take on the street). The lens costs $50 more than the Sony 50mm but it truly rivals glass more expensive than this. People are blown away by rather standard shots I've taken with this. If you don't care about the so-so kit lens and want to save some dollars, buy the body only and get the 35mm.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it after a slight tweak", "Author": "sfreez", "ReviewID": "R2E576XBS5CVPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture/Video quality:Coming from a Canon Rebel XSI and having a friend who bought a Nikon D5100 recently I have some decent comparisons.  I'm an amatuer and don't wanna mess with RAW which means my initial impression was based on JPG quality.  My primary use is home movies and pics of my kids, mostly indoors/low light.  With the default settings I was very disappointed with the results in mid-low light (Firmware 1.03).  Something in the sharpening algorithm makes everything look swatchy and unnatural, probably because of too much noise suppression.  I took the same pics with XSI and they looked smoother and nicer to me even after downsizing the a65 pics to 12mp.  But, on sonyalpharumors.com they mentioned JPG's might improve in some new firmware and in the meantime using -2 contrast, -2 sharpening helps, I tried that and it is dramatically improved for my taste.  I also shot in RAW a little prior to that change and could tell there's plenty of detail so there's obviously room for JPG improvement.  After playing around with it for a while I'm starting to like it more and more.  The autofocus and steadyshot work great during movie mode, a little slow in mid-low light.  Kit lens autofocus noise is present but fairly minimal. 60p greatly reduces rolling shutter.  Video quality is AMAZING.  Exposure, ISO, and AF Modes can all be adjusted during videos.  Pictures are great up to ISO 1600. 3200 is fairly decent, 6400 and on degrades quite a bit.  Starts up so fast most of the time.  Not sure why but sometimes takes 4-5 seconds, most of the time it's less than 1 second from off to pic.  Battery life is decent.  Took it on a weekend trip, used it about 1/3 of each day for a couple hundred pics and a dozen 1-2 minute videos and got home with 22%.  I felt like I had to use it a little conservatively to last the weekend but might be able to improve that by turning GPS off.Novelties:2x Smart teleconverter is nice but no different than cropping a picture down after the fact, would be way more useful if enabled for video. It's nice novelty to be able to review photos/access menus in the EVF, and the quality is great for both the EVF and LCD.  Can set camera down with Articulating screen facing you for self portrait because the screen folds out to the bottom. Smile detection didn't work with large group (15 people) probably because faces become too small to detect. Also, if you try to do a self portrait it's so fast that sometimes only one person is smiling and then takes about 5 seconds to automatically start detecting again.  HDR/Panorama/Bracketed shots work well.  I'm not a big fan of separate folders for pics and videos in review mode.  Takes 3 \"clicks\" to switch from one to the other.Positives:* Autofocus during video/live view works great, a little slower in lower light.* EVF/LCD quality is amazing* Haven't noticed overheating* 60p video virtually eliminates rolling shutter* Super fast startup* No EVF/LCD blackout during burst mode* Menus very user friendly and presentable* Like the AF Zone option (XSI didn't have this.  Uses left, right or center AF points)* Exposure, ISO, and AF Modes can all be adjusted during videos* Menus and photo review accessible in EVF* Articulating screen* GPS works well and locks fairly fast* Battery life good enoughNegatives* Default JPG settings disappoints, but can be improved* No smart teleconverter during videos* Pics and videos are separate in review mode* Wish max ISO was configurable in P/A/S modes and video mode* After 10-12 pic burst at 10 fps, slows to 1.5 fps while buffer is clearing.  Can still see LCD/EVF tho (just can't burst as fast)* Slow shutdown, although not really a problem* Screen folds out to the bottom so can't set it down facing you for self portrait* Deleting pics a little slow.  Takes about 1 second per pic, although multiple delete is available.* Hand grip is a little cramped for my big hands, but not too bad* Not as big of a \"newer\" lens selection as Canikon.  Lots of great older minolta's, but not as many newer budget options that generally have quieter autofocus motors which would be nice for videos.All in all i'd definitely recommend it.  I don't think I could justify the a77 personally since there's very few differences I care about.  More cross-type AF points, configureable max ISO in P/A/S modes, lens AF micro-adjust and weather sealing are the main ones, but not enough to justify the price.  Definitely prefer it over my Canon XSI and friends Nikon D5100 though.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compared to the Sony A55", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R37DK0J65B1TZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Sony A55 for just over two years. Unfortunately it failed twice and I've had to send it out for several weeks to a repair shop both times. I do think this is unusual and it is the first camera I've ever had that failed on me. I decided to step up to the A65 and keep the A55 as a backup. I'm a little miffed at Sony for the poor A55 reliability but I do think it isn't common. I'd have a hard time switching away from Sony. First I have a large investment in three lenses. Second I really like the translucent mirror technology and all it brings to the party. I think Sony is pushing the envelope and the camera has some really nice features.Here are my observations on the A65 compared to the A55.There are a number of web sites that you can use to compare the A55 to the A65 so I won't elaborate on the specification differences. But I did find some things about the camera that I had not read about, and of course there are my personal observations too.1) The weight difference between the lighter A55 and the A65 is quite noticeable to me. I used the A55 a lot and was very familiar with how it felt hanging from my wrist by the wrist strap. The truth is the three lenses I have add so much weight that the overall weight difference with the new body isn't really that much. I'll get over it.2) Size. The A65 is larger but not so much as to resemble one of the huge bodies of other DSLR cameras that just look obnoxious to me. The main benefit of the larger body is the hand grip now is comfortable. The A55 grip was initially too small for me (I think I have average man's hands) and it never felt better with time.3) The extra megapixels. I've never been chasing megapixels. I was quite happy with the image quality of the 16MP A55. So I was quite surprised when I took the first few photographs with the A65 and it's 24MP sensor. I was blown away with the quality improvement, something not born out by all of the technical reviews on the camera. After several hundred photos I've taken over the week I've had the camera I continue to be impressed. The other big benefit is I can crop images on my computer and still have really good image quality even if I've zoomed in 4x or so. Very nice.4) Expecting a lot from the OLED viewfinder that is so highly touted in the reviews it just didn't jump out at me. I'll have to wait until the A55 comes back from repair and compare the two. It does look larger but if I didn't know there was a published big difference I might not have noticed. I am quite pleased with both the A55 and A65 EVFs. After a week of use I have to say the EFV is good, but not so I marvel at it.5) Sony did move some buttons around a bit and for the most part I like the changes. The Video, AEL and tele-converter buttons are moved off the top a bit more and are easier to access and depress. The other buttons on the top of the camera near the shutter have been moved closer to the shutter so they are easier to access.6) I see Sony decided to put a dedicated ISO button by the shutter button, but they removed the D-Range button. This is a big disappointment to me. It may be that more sophisticated shooters play with ISO a lot but I don't do it often enough for a dedicated button on the top of the camera. On the other hand I did use the D-Range button a lot. I find a lot of high contrast shots are better handled by the Auto HDR feature. Gratefully I was able to reprogram the ISO button to activate D-Range but now my D-Range button is labeled ISO!7) I'm so glad the stereo microphone is colored black rather than the silver shown in many photos of the camera.8) The A55 has an infrared focus assist while the A65 uses the flash. I don't know which has better performance but I really like the infrared action over the flash. It is much more subtle.9) The On/Off button on the A55 has a nice crisp snap to it whereas the A65 feels soft and mushy.10) Placement of the small red Access Lamp (used to show when files are accessed on the SD card) is better on the A65. The A55 was too low and small. No big deal either way though.11) I REALLY like the shutter sound. The camera comes with the Front Curtain Shutter ON. When ON the first shutter action is electronic instead of the physical curtain moving. This means there is only one shutter sound per shutter release where as the A55 has a double click. The camera has a nice crisp sound for each photo. A big bonus is the shutter will have 1/2 the operations this way which should extend the life of the shutter. It was a fail of the shutter on the A55 which has it in the repair shop presently.12) When the A65 processes the Auto HDR images it takes much longer than on the A55. I suppose this is due to the larger image size. It is quite noticeable to me.13) I may be wrong about this but when reviewing images on the A55 holding the Zoom In button would automatically step through zooms until it reached the limit. On the A65 I have to manually push the button several times to effect the same result. I'll double check this when the A55 comes back from the repair shop (assuming they do fix it!). 7/18/13 True the A55 auto zooms while holding the buttons but the A65 does not. Annoying.14) As noted in almost every review I've read the noise of the sensor is more than anyone would like. Most reviews said it wasn't good above 1600 or 3200 ISO but I've noticed it in all images. I think the A55 is better in this respect. It is most noticeable in lower light situations. I'm happy with the overall image quality but this forces me to think about ISO and make adjustments to compensate. Not good. This is the reason I rated the camera 4 stars instead of 5 stars. In the end I keep the A65 set to ISO 100 about 99% of the time which provides the minimum noise. The two lenses I use the most are both f2.8 zooms across their whole zoom range so they capture light well enough to keep the camera at ISO 100. Noise isn't an issue and images are astounding.15) Being able to reprogram/reassign some buttons to other functions is very nice. I can customize the camera to my liking.16) Improved battery life on the A65 is already noticeable and appreciated. However I never felt the battery life of the A55 was hindering me. I rarely had to change batteries during a single day and I'm often likely to take several hundred photos in a day.17) Programmable buttons. I really appreciate that the AEL and ISO buttons can be assigned to one of many other functions. I only wish that capability would be extended to the Control Button (4 way rocker). I'm okay with WB, Display, and Drive mode but the bottom of the rocker is assigned to Picture Effect which I will never use. It sure would be nice to assign that button to something I would use.Overall I'm pleased with the A65.Update April 23, 2013.I've now had the camera for almost two weeks. I've taken perhaps 2,000 photos and I am very pleased with it. Not only is the image quality very good but I also find that photo processing algorithms work better on my computer with these high pixel count images. The photos are quite sharp to begin with but when I use a sharpen feature on the computer it does a better job than when I did it with the A55 images.I posted three images on this Amazon web page. One of my grandson playing soccer, another of a black vintage car, and a third of the inside of a vintage restored car.April 26, 2013 updateI now wish I had done a bit more research on the A77 before I made this purchase. It is $200 more than the A65 but there are some things I'd like to have. I watched quite a few A77 reviews on youtube and learned some things. First the A77 can save images to the SD card almost twice fast as the A65 with the right SD card. Second the A77 body is sealed so it isn't likely to be damaged by water or dust which would complement my sealed Sony 16-50 f2.8 lens. Third it has more focus points which I now understand makes it focus faster. There is more but these differences will remain out of my reach because I'm unlikely to buy another camera for about 5 years. I'm still very happy with the A65.May 31, 3012 updateI've just received my A55 back from Sony repair today and it is fixed and working as new again. So I'm able to make just a few more observations now that I have both the A55 and A65 in hand.1) Indeed it is true that when reviewing still photos and wanting to zoom in the A55 buttons will automatically step through zoom in and zoom out levels just by holding the buttons. With the A65 I have to successively push the zoom buttons manually. This is a disappointment as I use this feature often. I'm concerned about wearing the button action out.2) The A55 LCD screen is a 16:9 format while the A65 is a 3:2 format. I don't know why Sony decided to make that design change but I do prefer the A55 16:9 format. I posted a photo on this A65 page so you could see the difference. Sorry I only had my iPod Touch camera to take the photo so it isn't the best.3) The OLED viewfinder of the A65 is indeed superior. It is brighter and the text showing camera setup is outside the frame whereas the A55 lays the text on top of the image being viewed. Still unless I have both cameras in hand the better A65 viewfinder didn't jump out at me.I sure do like the grip (one of my few real complaints about the A55)on the A65.In the A65 I finally own a camera that takes the kind of photos I always wished I could. My talent is lacking but the camera isn't.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best camera I've ever owned", "Author": "Richie Deschamps", "ReviewID": "R17PU08KU29GMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Photography has been a hobby of mine for the past three years, and I've been through several Sony alpha series cameras. I started with the a330, sold that to upgrade to the a550, and then sold that to upgrade to the a65. I also own the a37. More on that in a bit.I primarily use this camera for concert photography, as live music is another hobby of mine. While the a550 was excellent at low-light photography, the a65 pretty much blows it out of the water in terms of shooting at high IS0 (usually at 1600) and its super fast 10 shots per second feature. Even shooting at ISO 3200 will produce usable results.The video feature, however, is where this camera truly shines. I've gotten more and more into video production in the past year, and the cinematic quality that this camera produces matches top tier Canon cameras at a much lower price. Seriously, if you are considering shooting video with a DSLR, this is the wisest and most affordable purchase you'll ever make. I highly suggest shooting in Manual mode with a shutter speed of 1/50, and shoot at 24p if you can. You will be blown away by how \"filmic\" the results are. This camera paired with my a37, has produced some pretty amazing footage.The high resolution swivel screen is also a major plus. You can view the screen from any angle and it always looks beatiful. I suggest you keep the screen in its closed position (with the screen facing the camera) when you store it in your bag. The screen, although somewhat resistent to scratches, CAN get scratched, so be careful. Buy a screen protector if you don't think you can remember to close it every time you're done using the camera.Some people don't like the electronic viewfinder. It's a matter of taste. I loved the optical viewfinder on my a550, but honestly the electronic viewfinder is pretty awesome. Get with the times, this is where photography is heading.I can't reccomend this camera more if you're very much into photography/video but don't want to spend thousands of dollars on pro equipment.

The two main reasons I wanted this was 1) the increased resolution on the sensor and 2) the buffer built into the camera for recording the image.  I shoot quite a bit in low / \"no\" light situations.  I photograph storms frequently, and the problem I ran into with my older body is that when shooting storms at night with long exposure times, I had to wait 30 seconds or so for the camera to process and record the file.  Hence, I had to wait while the action was still going on before I could fire the camera again.Here are my initial impressions for my situation:I can tell you that both of the reasons I was looking to upgrade are more than satisfied with this product.  The images are DYNOMITE, and I can fire 30 second exposures repeatedly without delay.  That is the best news I could have had.  They more than overcome the following negative I discovered for my work:Unfortunately one of the advancements that comes on this camera seems to work against when shooting storms...the OLED viewfinder.  For shooting during the day, it is awesome, I especially like the built in level indicators and ability to choose what information is displayed.  BUT, this weekend on a camping trip we were awakened by thunder in the distance.  Time to bust out the camera!!!  Well, in the dead of night you can't see anything thru the viewfinder.  In optical viewfinders, you can at least make out a shape of a tree in the foreground to compose your frame.  Not with this.  It was an unexpected discovery...one that I didn't see coming.  It may be possible for me to use a flashlight to shine on the scene and compose, but I will have to wait for the next opportunity to find out.I would purchase this camera again.  Any serious photographer knows that the perfect camera does not exist.  I am looking forward to learning more about this one.  The pics I got from the storm this weekend were really good, so I'm not terribly discouraged with the viewfinder situation.

I have no experience in photography what so ever.  I have always used a decent point and shoot but never seemed to get a properly focused shot.  I decided to finally spend the money and invest in a DSLR.  After receiving this Sony, I was immediately impressed with the overall build quality and overall ease of use even though I have no experience with the unit.Between yesterday and today, I have taken approximately 500 shots, some in light, some in dark with flash.  Let's just say that this camera can NOT take a bad picture.  The details in every single picture that I have taken are awesome.  Keep in mind I have no clue when it comes to professional photography, what they would be looking for.  The viewfinder itself is amazing to look through.  It has the built in level and grid showing focus points and the image is crystal clear.  The lcd screen is also very crystal clear and easy to use.  I really like how it automatically switches from LCD to viewfinder when you put your face close to it.I find the 18-55mm zoom kit lens to be very nice.  I took a few images of some landscaping from about 100 feet away and was able to get some really clear shots.  The auto tracking focus does a great job for snapping shots on the go.From power off position to actually taking a picture is lightning fast.  Pretty much as fast as your hand can switch it on and then take a picture is how fast it will process the first image.Movie mode I tried a couple of times and it takes AMAZING audio and video.  Between movements, there is no sudden jerks or jolts shown in video.  Audio is crystal clear.Battery life seems decent.  After taking 300 shots and playing with different menu functions and taking video, I still had about 33% left.  I will probably pick up a second battery just to be safe.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to learning the art of photography.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "skatermike26", "ReviewID": "R1Y5LRU98U0XTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all Sony has come a VERY long way in the Dslr/Slt world.

I've never had a Nikon but always used Kodak, Fuji, Canon and as of late Sony. All camera manufacturers have the ability to produce nice to excellent image quality, it is important to have the right tool then go get creative with it. Now for my review.I won't go into great detail but I can tell you that I was always a big fan of Optical Viewfinder's. They let you see through the lens and the image is not an electronic representation of what you're shooting. When the SLT's first came out, I thought I would never get one but boy was I surprised! I like being able to make changes and knowing what the picture will look like before I take it. This is one of the benefits of the electronic viewfinder, also it has an overlay of information regarding the camera's functions, or you can tailor it to your liking.At 10 frames per second, it's really fast. I haven't had any lag issues with the electronic viewfinder when panning my shots, \"i.e. birds in flight\". But it helps to have a fast shutter speed trust me! The focus speed is also very quick and it will auto track the subject that is in motion. I haven't had an issue with this, except for the very rare out of focus shot.ISO performance is where this camera loses \u00bd star. You would be fine up to ISO 1600, but after that details in lowlight get a bit mushy. Also, it depends what you call acceptable. For my purposes, I can print up to ISO 3200 on 8 x 10 and still be happy. Those extreme pixel peepers might want to look elsewhere, but you would be happier with a better lens \"wider constant aperture\".The JPEG's are for me very acceptable, but for even better image quality you should be shooting in RAW which is where this 24 megapixel sensor excels. Image quality is a matter of opinion for most, but this is not an issue for me.As for the cameras construction, it is mostly made of polycarbonate plastic, with a nice, firm rubber grip and it does feel well-built. This camera is not weather sealed, so if you do purchase this make sure to buy a good camera bag. For that, I purchased the Lowepro Nova 170 AW which is an all weather bag that also has a bonnet to pull over in case of heavy rain.In conclusion, I would say this camera has been worth the purchase for me. You would benefit from buying a good lens and perhaps Carl Zeiss is not out of the question. I hope I have helped \"somewhat\" with your decision on this camera and if you do purchase, that it will serve you just as well.

Perhaps because I've always known that Nikon and Canon are the brands the pros use.  Well, I'm not a pro but I did take a basic photography class in college and I must say this camera is truly an amazing piece of equipment.  Before purchasing, I went to the Houston Camera Exchange store and compared the Canon 60D to the Sony A65. (Having in mind I was going to purchase the Canon or perhaps a Nikon of similar quality).  Both having a similar quality lens, the pictures on the Sony were significantly better looking in terms of color.  The Canon seemed to loose the true color images i was shooting.  The Sony also felt better in the hand and I really liked the explanation of the shooting modes when you move the dial.  The translucent mirror seems to be an outstanding concept.  I believe the other brands will soon do away with the reflex mirror and use the translucent mirror technology.  It just seems the less moving parts, the better.  The Sony Alpha is not an SLR.  It's an SLT.  Single lens Translucent (mirror).  The mirror does not move as with the SLR's.I purchased the body only and additionally purchased the Sony SAL 18250Alpha DT 18-250mm lens from Amazon as well.  Although the lens was almost as expensive as the camera body, it's much better quality than most lenses that come with camera package deals.  The 18-250mm covers just about anything I'll ever need it for.  I might get one more lens in the future.I've only had the camera two weeks so I'll make a promise to update this rating in the future in terms of longevity.  However, at the moment, I'm more satisfied than I thought I would be.  I like shooting in low light situations and this camera is outstanding in that category.  I've taken some cool night time pics without flash.  With and without tripod and all pics were really great quality.I would recommend purchasing David Bush's Sony SLT - A65 Book.  It's 386 pages and very comprehensive yet very easy to read for beginners as well as seasoned photographers.

I did a fair amount of research on cameras in the Sony brand and began to lock in on the A65. The features it contains fit my style of photography very well...which includes just about everything from nature and landscape to events and people, and the price fell within my budget. Many of the comparison reviews I read/watched compared it favorably against comperable Canon and Nikon cameras with the Sony winning out in most categories. My first impressions from day one of its arrival were favorable. My only concern was I wasn't sure how I would like the digital viewfinder, but my fears were set aside when I discovered how easy the digital viewfinder made it to use manual focus...which I need to do sometimes. Using my A100 I just could never get manual focus to work very well...plus my third party 1.4 teleconverter would not autofocus with the lenses I have using the A100, but discovered to my delight that for some reason with the A65, it appears to no longer be an issue...more testing is required though to determine if that holds true.The only negative I see with the camera is that it seems almost too lightly built to be rugged enough for heavy outdoors/nature photography. The old A100 feels more robust than the larger A65. It's certainly not a show stopper, but a noticable factor to me. It just needs to be handled with proper care. My A100 was dropped several times, fell off the tripod a time or two, and had the tripod fall over at least once, plus I used it in rain and fog and cold and heat, and it never failed once...that was one tough little camera. The only other negative was that with my main goto lens...again a third party 50-500mm lens...there was an auto focus compatibility issue with the A65. To their credit, the lens manufacturer offered a free upgrade to resolve the issue and said the upgrade would make it fully compatible...at this writing I am still waiting to test out that promise. So far from what use I've been able to apply...the A65 makes a great upgrade.Update:I've used the A65 for a few weeks now and have fallen in love with it.

EVF at the beginning certainly looked impressive, a lot more clearer than Nikon or Canon. But as I used the camera for a couple of months I started getting uneasy with Sony. I tried to convince myself that may be I am not taking pictures correctly etc.but finally I decided to take some loss and sell the camera/lenses and buy Nikon 7100. I would say that that is my best decision in photography. Here are some salient points to consider:1) EVF feature adds a lot of clarity for sure. However it is hard to use it at night. One advantage of EVF is that you can view the pictures with full clarity in EVF which is not possible to do in Nikon.2) LIVE mode makes sense only in EVF as I see it. I hardly use it for Nikon as what you see in display outside does not resemble the picture. However what you see in EVF does. So you are more inclined to take pictures with LIVE shots in Sony.3) Video is significantly better in Sony. However if you need Video, get a Video camera, do not use expensive DSLR for videos4) Lenses for Sony/Minolta seem to be more cheaper than Nikon and they are of as high quality as Nikon/Canon5) The main issue I see with A65 is that color rendition is very poor. Colors are flat. Look unnatural in evening or sunlight condition. Also in portrait mode they tend to have reddish tinge while in sunlight they tend to have more yellow tinge. I first thought that I am adjusting colors but that is not the case. I expect the default photos to reflect the actual colors as your eye sees it. I did not succeed to make this work on Sony. So much so that every shot I took made be uncomfortable until I sold the camera. When EVF starts looking not what your eye sees and when pictures seem to have artificial colors unlike what our eye sees, if you are a bit obsessive, it makes you uncomfortable.

I did manage to find two bushes that had flowers on them (but no insects) and was amazed at the macro shots when I got back home and viewed them on the computer monitor!  Colors were natural with no saturation problems and the image was very sharp in the focal plain region.  Since the lens also is a 50mm fixed lens I took photos of the surrounding landscape and a few portrait shots of our daughter which turned out fantastic as well.The GPS feature of the camera is not mentioned in the owners manual beyond telling the user how to turn it on and off.  I was clueless in what to look for to find the GPS location data until doing a bunch of searching on the Internet.  As far as I can tell, the GPS data is not visible in real-time; it is only available AFTER you take a photo and shows up in the display of the camera when viewing stored images.  The data is also embedded in the RAW and JPG files which can be used with Google Earth to show the location where the photo was taken.  It may take about 10 minutes outdoors with the camera before the camera locks in on the GPS satellites in a fairly open space with some trees around.  This feature was not on my list of features I was particularly looking for but it is nice to have.The Sony HVL-F43AM flash unit was tested out taking photos of our black cat and, using the macro lens, taking photos of some small troll dolls my sister-in-law wanted to sell on eBay.  No complaints on the flash pictures or the flash unit.The panoramic photo feature was tried out and it did a very good job of stitching the photo frames together but because you have to continuously move (pan) the camera to use this feature there is, of course, some motion blur when you zoom in close in the resulting panoramic photo.  This is a feature I don't see me using very often so this doesn't bother me.Battery life is great on the camera and I do recommend buying a spare battery if you are going to do a lot of photos at one time and can't wait for the battery to recharge.  Be careful of Chinese made fake \"Sony\" batteries.  I bought mine from B&H; Photo since they do cary the real McCoy Sony battery (with Amazon you are taking your chances from what I have read in the reviews).The memory card I bought with the camera is the SanDisk model SDSDX-032G-AFFP which is working out real well for both video and 10 shots/second stills.BTW, I set the camera to store both RAW and JPG images just in case I'm not happy with the way the camera's JPG image is created.  So far the JPG images have been excellent 90 percent of the time so haven't done anything with the RAW images.  Some people had complained of the JPG quality but that must have been in the first release of the camera before all of the firmware updates because I don't see any issues with the JPG results myself.Hope this review helps you in your decision on buying or not buying this camera along with the lenses and flash unit I also purchased.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Metz", "ReviewID": "R3PW1TBDJQGD91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very much satisfied with the performance of the new Sony A65 camera.

Generally speaking, people say that video on a dslr isn't very good compared to a handheld camcorder.

If you have really big hands, you might find it a bit cramped, but for medium/average hands it should feel good.The sensor is fantastic.  Doubling the megapixel count hits you in the hard drive, but you can crop the living daylights out of the image and still have fantastic quality.  The focus performance is very good, and the button layout makes a lot of sense.  It was a very smooth and easy transition from the older Sony.  The autodrive speed is amazing; the prism is worth it's weight in gold if you need fast autodrive in a moderately priced camera.Now, on to the EVF.  It's fantastic.  The level is extremely useful to me; I don't know how much time I've spent straightening a photo by half a degree.  No more.  The best feature for me is focus peaking.  I'd read about it, and it sounded interesting, but now that I've used it, it might be my favorite feature on this amazing camera.  My right eye is a bit weak, and I never felt like I had the diopter set right on my A700, so I almost never used manual focus.  Focus peaking, made possible by the EVF, shows you exactly which pixels are in focus.  It's a fantastic feature.  I'm using manual focus more than I even have, and getting great results.  Yes, Sony has some of the best autofocus in the business, but there are times when manual focus is just faster, more intuitive, and more creative.  And now, for me, it's very sharp and accurate too!  I love sweep panorama and the tilting LCD, but focus peaking might just be my favorite feature on this camera.  It's changed the way I shoot.  Proofing photos without taking your eye away from the viewfinder (again, only possible with an EVF) is also great.So, I'm thrilled with this camera.  If you've been wondering, or maybe skeptical, about the latest generation of Sony SLTs, take the plunge.  I'm really, really glad I did.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Much better than I expected.", "Author": "Grady R.

I recently picked up a Nikon D800 (was hoping the a99 would do decent video) and there are many things I've grown to love about the a65 that simply aren't present in non-SLT cameras.  Having the ability to shoot in live view is not only convenient but it's a lot of fun.  Auto-focus during video is pretty good and having image stabilization built into the body is such a large benefit that that feature alone makes the camera worth a lot more (depending on what lenses you shoot with).  With the D800, admittedly I'm still getting used to it, I'm back to the days of not exceeding the reciprocal of the focal length for hand-held shots, meaning a 35mm lens can only shoot at 1/35 of a second, max.  I'm used to getting 1/10 of a second shots with the a65 no matter what lens is on it.  This isn't an in-depth review, but rather a huge endorsement of the a65.  For the price it's at now, there's nothing that comes close.  I started out with a T3i and it couldn't focus in a medium-lit room.  The a65 can focus in next to no light.  I would have loved to move on to the a99, but Sony's video is far worse that what I get from a $400 Canon with the CMOS Pro sensor.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low Light Camera", "Author": "Ty \"DVS 1\"", "ReviewID": "RG4IP9HH6PA5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to get all technical with the details. I'm going to tell you some of the features that I like and how I use the camera. First, I used to shoot with Minolta Maxxum 9xi in the days of film. I went to Canon 10D for a couple years, sold all of it except my old minolta items. That paid off in the long run.I use this camera for low light, no flash photography of bands performing on stage in bars, clubs, etc. I threw my old Minolta AF 50mm 1.7 and it works like a charm. In fact, currently this is the only lens I have used since I bought the camera in August 2012. I usually shoot ISO 800, sometimes 1600 and am quite pleased with the turnout of the images, as well as my clients.Features I like? I love the HD Movie capability, and am now considering a second camera body to use for multi camera music video production. 10fps? Clearly a positive thing. I haven't used it at that speed yet, but I have fired off 4-6 images quickly before depending on what my performers on stage were doing.Creative modes....omg there are so many. I don't use them for shows that much, but they are fun to play around with. Color separation BW mode, toy camera mode, miniature mode, high contrast....it just goes on & on & on...I don't regret this camera purchase at all. In fact my ex was so impressed with it, that she also bought one to use for starting her canine photography business. I will be adding a second body to use for music video production as well as for my assistant to have the same shooting abilities with hardware that I do and not have to worry about whether what she's using could pull off something tricky.One disadvantage I have discovered is that there currently is not a battery grip made for this camera.

The first camera was a Minolta Maxxum 3xi, then a 5D DSLR.  Great optics and shooting mechanics.  When Sony bought out the Minolta line, I followed the line and bought an Alpha 350.  About three weeks ago, I received my newest camera, a Sony A65.  Pedigrees aside, I researched the reviews, ratings and compared issues I'd had with previous camera bodies to determine whether or not it was time to switch to a more 'professional' brand like Nikon or Canon.  In the end, I'm VERY happy to have chosen this body and to continue my relationship with the Minolta/Sony camera line.The A65 is an affordable and very flexible camera body with great features.  One of the things that has sold me on the Minolta/Sony pedigree is the rich, vibrant color the cameras have been able to capture.  The A65 is not exception to this.  Over the past three weeks, I've put the camera through it's paces shooting two model sets (one with full studio lighting and one with subdued lighting), an outdoor baby shower for a friend and a nature set with my assistant.  In each case, the camera admirably adjusted for light conditions on automatic, auto+ and scene settings while producing excellent color saturation, sharp focus and great image resolution.One issue my previous cameras had was shooting in low light conditions.  During shows and events, I frequently found myself using every trick in the book to get shots.  With the A65, this isn't a problem anymore.  The A65 seems to have the speed and sensor abilities to shoot well in low light conditions without inducing substantial noise.For any photographer looking to move to a medium range / medium format camera, the Sony A65 is an excellent purchase.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "S.

I really liked this camera though. It shares the same large sensor as Sony's NEX-VG30H $2,700 semi-pro video camera. Problem: The LCD flip out screen only turns to face outward from below.  If the camera is on a tripod it's almost useless if you're in front of the camera. I knew that before I bought it but I thought I could get by and line up shots before stepping out front. I tried but it just sucks to work that way. It's too much of a hassle re-doing takes I messed up because I couldn't see. The A77 screen flips over the top and that's what I need. It's just a lot of money for that one feature. Otherwise I would have kept it.I think the auto focus is way too fast for video work. It's too jarring and sometimes erratic. Manual focus is the way to go or just be very careful with the AF zones and avoid large shifts in focus. FYI, in video mode, you cannot use auto-focus unless you're in total automatic mode with this camera, i.e. you cannot adjust shutter speed and/or aperture ~and~ use auto-focus at the same time. I don't think the A77 can do it either. (My Panasonic HC-X920 can do it.) This is really only an issue for me in very low light when I want to lower the shutter speed down to 1/25 but the cost/benefit ratio outweighs this issue.The footage looks great though. Nice shallow depth of field when I want it. It matches almost perfectly with that from my Panasonic HC-X920. I can barely tell the difference. I got the 18-135mm lens and it's pretty good. It's a little noisy in indoor lighting with the ISO above 400.  Gonna try the f/2.8 16-50mm and that should help.The built-in mic is a total hiss factory but who cares.

The first shock was the viewfinder... used to the optical, there is the OLED, wich is muuuuch better than the one in a57, a55...but anyway i'am missing the oldschool optical viewfinder.The other issue is the JPEG compression... too much detail from the 24mp sensor is loosen.The good point is the speed, the AF is also a big step over the a200...Recomend? Yes! If you ton't mind the bigger price, go for the a77 (weatherproof body, adjustable auto iso range, better AF system....), btu for this price range the a65 is a bargain.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "sony a65", "Author": "dombro2004", "ReviewID": "R20QEA5VRLQL4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera.

Back focus is a major problem with this camera and unlike the higher end cameras it cannot be adjusted by the user. Sony service is dismissive and simply will refer you to a Sony web page that tells you how to test for back focus problems. It is telling that there actually is a Sony page for this problem!

And why I need Sony SLT if I have to switch to manual focus anyway? I can be better off with Canon or Nikon's offering then, which also have much better lens selection.It's not possible even preset EV correction before switching to video, which is possible in much less expensive cameras.Shooting stills is not possible in movie mode either, which seems to be downgrade from a55.The camera does not deliver what I expected from such high price point. Comparing to a55 Sony asks $200 more just for more pixels. I don't need them.Update:I returned the camera, just to many issues to tolerate for $1k price tag: - inconsistent exposure with built-in flash with still subject - random lockups, sometimes camera wouldn't turn on, sometimes it wouldn't turn off - custom WB does not work indoors at all, get error every time - AF errors in movie mode with sony 55-200 lens, camera would start loosing focus all over the sudden when filming a still subject - noise is really big issue for this sensor, iso 1600 is barely usable for indoors - pictures are less sharp with a65 vs a55 shot with same lensI would rather see Sony giving us bigger sensor at affordable price put into SLT bodies then keep adding pixels to APS-C.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Will I like my A65?", "Author": "Paul Herson", "ReviewID": "R1CWP5YUA2H4I6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the A65 pretty much on time via Amazon Prime(full filled by Amazon).

My Minolta lenses are supposed to fit and work with these Sony cameras, but I haven't had a chance to find out because I cannot remove the body cap from the new camera!The notch on the body cap - by the 'Y' on SONY is at 6 o'clock (clock face). It will only rotate at far as 5 o'clock. It doesn't matter if I hold down the lens release button or not, I cannot remove the body cap. I suspect the body cap was jammed on wrong at the factory. Either that, or this camera had been returned to Amazon by someone who got the cap off but didn't know what they were doing when they put it back on.The red dot for mounting the lens should be at 1 o'clock (but of course I can't see it with the cap on), which means the notch on the body cap should be at 3 and then rotate up toward 1 to be removed. Instead it's stuck between 6 o'clock and 5. I even charged the battery and inserted it thinking that maybe the camera had to be on in order to remove the cap or a lens. No surprise, it didn't help.Has anyone else had this problem? I'm thinking I'm going to have to return the camera.
