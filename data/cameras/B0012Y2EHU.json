Allgood \"PMA\"", "ReviewID": "RIKOHKLFI0SUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was primarily intended for the younger crowd, but I will definitely recommend it to Anyone of Any Age. Its very stylish if you care about that, and the features are spectacular. With the up to 10MP resolution, and the highly advanced face detection, and the fact that the video clips are in MP4 format make this camera a must have for the occasional picture taker of any age. The bundled software is ok, though I prefer to just use Windows Photo Gallery to import and format the SD card. Of course there are many many more features to speak of, but I want to keep this short. Overall, It's an A+. Super sharp photos, clean and smooth video (With Sound) and a fairly sharp 2.5\" LCD. Its one of those 'Pull it out of your pocket, slide it open and shoot\" That fast, that easy. Oh, and by the way, forget about AA or AAA batteries, This has a cell-phone like Li-Ion battery that lasts and lasts, and comes with charger (No USB charging though) If you do choose this model, you won't regret it.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than It Looks", "Author": "L. Rushforth", "ReviewID": "R25SWS9WVU1KGC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small and simple camera, and I am very happy with the Z20fd.  This camera looks too small and to simple to be as good as it is.UPSIDE:  Small size.  Simple operation.  I recently took it on a trip to Hawaii, and I was very pleased with the photo quality and even the videos.  It was easy to carry in a pocket.  As others have mentioned, this camera does quite well in dim light.  The default settings are just what I want most of the time, but there are different modes that are fun to play with.  It accepts xD and SD chips.  A separate button for video mode simplifies video recording.DOWNSIDE:  The battery life was not as good as my Fujifilm F10, and this may be because the front slide that turns the camera on can too easily be opened in one's pocket.  There is no optical viewfinder, and in bright sunlight the LCD screen is hard to see.  It is too easy to put your finger in front of the lens.  Also, I would prefer more than 3x optical zoom (however, but with this size of camera without an extended lens, it does quite well).  The audio portion of videos can be muddled in crowds or in noisy locations, and some music is quite distorted (although I have not found any digital camera in this price range that does as well).  The video button is small and awkward to push, and first-time users often assume it is the power button, inadvertently starting a video recording when only wanting to turn the camera on.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "nice camera", "Author": "Nicole Baker", "ReviewID": "RLZ895PD4AIAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for a couple days, but so far I REALLY like it. My old camera was a casio exilim that I got about 4-5 years ago, and it finally bonked, so my daddy got me the finepix. One of the first things I noticed was that the finepix has a much clearer screen. I had tested a finepix in the store prior to receiving mine as a gift, and I noticed that it had one of the clearest screens, even in comparison to some of the more expensive digital cameras. Trying out the features, I was very happy with the facial recognition, auto focus, stabilization, etc. because I tend to have an unsteady hand and normally take pictures that are out of focus. I also like the pre-set photo options for situations such as low light, ebay photos, and others and how the camera automatically adjusts lighting, flash, etc. I appreciate that the zoom is internal - my old camera's zoom popped out of the front of the camera, and that just annoyed me. I also like the macro setting - I think still life/conceptual type photos are the coolest. I noticed the shutter speed on the finepix is way better than on my old camera too. With my old camera, most of the pictures of my dog would turn out blurry or fuzzy because by the time I tried to capture a picture he would move. This camera is able to get clear shots of him. The video is also much clearer than it was with my old camera. Also, I am very pale, and most cameras make me look like a washed out zombie, but with this camera I looked like a normal (though still pale) human. I think the only thing I don't like so far is the software, but I have an SD card reader and will probably start using that so I can bypass using the software all together. I'd definitely recommend this camera for anyone who wants random shots of family, friends, pets, nature, etc. as well as short videos. The photo quality looks very good on my macbook, although I have not yet printed any photos. Although the camera is not professional quality, for the price it exceeds expectations!", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera", "Author": "Glenn D.

I hope this camera last longer.  I bought this camera because of it's size, weight, and fact that the lens does not stick out of the camera.  I can keep the camera in my pocket, turn it on, and take it out to be discreet if need be.I do not like the face recognition and analyzing feature unless I am specifically taking a picture of a person.  It slows down the camera option.  Also, you can not disable automatic review.  The minimum is 1.5 seconds which also slows down the speed at which you can take pictures.I do like the second button for rapid movie recording.  Video quality is alright.  It is nothing to brag about but decent enough for YouTube.

Wesslen", "ReviewID": "R1CFY55BSJ8NFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after a lot of research. My criteria were: under $200, good quality, SD compatible, stylish and a slide cover (protected lens). I was thinking about purchasing one of the waterproof olympus's but decided against it after looking at the focus problems and lower image quality.This camera was absolutely amazing! Opening the box you realize what a great job Fuji has done. The camera's battery charges in a cradle (you have to remove the battery from the camera) which is nice because it allows one battery to charge while you use the camera with another battery, instead of connecting the camera to a charger.What was most important to me was ease of use and general image quality. I hate waiting for a camera to turn on and the down time in between pictures. This camera with a high speed SD card is lightning fast. You don't have to worry about fiddling with settings or adjusting it. It truly is a point and shoot. Everytime I clicked the shutter I was left with a great image. With the option of double imaging, the camera will take a picture with and without the flash within the same second, allowing you to chose the best.All around this camera is great.

Video is in MP4 format and the pack-in suggest Quicktime (As it's included)However I don't suggest installing it, you can get any kind of MP4 playing software that surpasses Quicktime. with a rechargable lithium ion battery and great battery life, you'll be able to take a large amount of pictures and movies (Depending on what size SD card you get)only bad thing is you can't use the cam as a web cam and you can't \"use\" the camera in USB mode.However the photo quality is superb and video quality is perfect which makes up for the USB mode flaw.

I read the manual and discovered I had to \"format\" it (which took two seconds) so that was solved.  Otherwise, I love the quality of the pictures; the menu is clear and easy to read and navigate; it uploads beautifully (didn't use the included software, just went straight from SD card to laptop); and of course, I love how sleek and lightweight it is!  I have a young child, and when I want to take pictures, I don't want a lot of lag time between when I press the button and it taking the picture.  My old camera took like 3 or 4 seconds (yes, it was horrible), but this one is very fast!

The photo quality was very disappointing and was finally forced to carry my old Canon digital elph for pics.  The movie quality was very good and I loved the MP4 (lots of video very small files) format but just could not stand the pictures.The ergonomics were not the best.  Worst feature was a very small separate movie button very hard to turn on and off.  It was nice having a separate button for pics and movies but still. . . . . .Another bad feature  was it is very easy to put the left fingers over the lens.  This is the result of a good feature in that the lens never protrudes from the camera but then you have no reference point and the fingers get over the lens very easily especially if you rest fingers on top of camera.Just finally had to sell it - believe me you can do a lot better than this camera.
