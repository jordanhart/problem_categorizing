Brand new alkaline batteries last only long enough to take 5 or 6 pictures.  When I take the battery out after it dies, it is *hot*.  The camera has to pull open to use, but it is so stiff my 9 year could not do it until I worked on it and put wax on to keep the plastic from binding.  The pictures are ok, but I don't expect the kids will ever use them.  Every time they try, the battery is dead again.  A real disappointment.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worth maybe $10 at best", "Author": "Scouting in VT", "ReviewID": "R1N4FTAEH9W45K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is not worth buying unless you have very specific need for a tiny camera that takes mediocre photos of items at EXACTLY 6'!  Seriously, the focus is fixed at 6' and it has no depth of field (look it up) so only things at that distance are in focus.  The rest are blurry.I also found it very hard to open up, it sticks terribly.But this next problem was what made me want to toss it out.  The battery only lasts a couple days sitting in the camera with it OFF.  So you have to plan when you're going to take photos with it, so you can install/recharge a fresh battery.  I bought this to have a camera in my coat pocket all the time, which won't work because of this battery problem.Video?  Seriously???  NOT!  It takes up to 8 seconds of very low quality, with only the stuff at 6' in focus, and some SERIOUS color problems.Don't bother buying it, you'll only be disappointed.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "great photographic effects", "Author": "Michelle M. Ress \"safoocat\"", "ReviewID": "R2J0SUP8QWLLIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you aren't aware of the type of picture this camera takes search on flickr and you will see the beautiful colors and effects this camera produces. I'd like to give itfive stars but it has a drawback. You have to do one of the numerous mods tokeep it from eating batteries or take the battery out when not in use.I keep one in my pocket at all times and an extra rechargeable battery. Use only rechargeable batteries. My only other criticism is it's so tiny that I like more inmy hand when taking pictures but it is designed to be a small camera. I'm planningon making a bigger frame for it that will also hold more batteries.It's not a child's camera, it's for serious photography. You'd have to pay a lot ofmoney to buy an expensive camera that would give you the same effects as a Vistaquest.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Only Digital LOMO Option", "Author": "Gabriel Velasco", "ReviewID": "R2WP7C8QBNMYY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really the only digital camera worthy of the LOMO description.  It's so small and convenient that there is really no excuse not to have it with you at all times.  It might be the smallest camera that has support for an SD card.  In fact, this would best be described as an SD card reader that just happens to have a camera built-in.Good: Small.  Convenient.  SD card support.  No special drivers needed to transfer pictures.  Pictures with lots of saturation, strange colors, and vignetting.  Interesting movies.Bad: Eats batteries.  512 M. SD card max.
