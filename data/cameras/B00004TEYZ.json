{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1DHXK4XMDQF32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a first time user of a digital camera and I am awed by the outstanding quality of the pictures and the simple use of the camera.  I reviewed quite a few different companies and cameras before settling on the  Sony FD-90.  Originally one of my criteria was size.  Yes the Sony FD-90 is  a little bulky because of the standard floppy drive but all in all it is  just a little bigger then an ordinary 35mm camera and is probably lighter  in weight.  I use my FD-90 for work (and for play) and one of the features  I enjoy is being able to make copies of the disks on the spot and to hand  them out to other people at meetings.  The floppy disk makes this camera  absolutely simple to use.  Shoot a picture and put the disk in your  computer and the picture is there as quick as your computer can access the  floppy drive.  No cables to hook up!  I have not used the new Memory Stick  with this camera although it is an available option.  For the price of  floppies I don't foresee needing anything else. I had considered the Sony  FD-88 but I saw a lot of reviews complaining about red eye in the pictures.  I was pleased to find on this FD-90 there is a red eye reduction feature  built into the flash and it actually works. Another feature I like is the  MPEG capability.  For me this feature is basically a toy and is really only  useful for placing small MPEG movies on a web site or for emailing. From  what I've seen in reviews of other cameras is that there is a problem with  battery consumption.  With the FD-90 you get a lithium ion battery and a  charger so there will be no problem with that.  I've been getting a full  hour of shots with a full charge.  Consider all the functions like flash  and zoom and these use battery life so an hour is pretty good.  I bought a  spare battery as well but so far have not had to use it. Overall I would  recommend this digital camera for everybody.  From the box it is very  simple to use.  You'll be up and running as soon as you get the battery  charged (you can read the manual while it's charging) and you'll be having  fun with this camera in no time at all.", "Date": "June 14, 2000"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect!", "Author": "\"netzen7\"", "ReviewID": "R3NAFRE4T46PO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera and the starter kit (extra higher capacity battery and carrying case) in time for a weeklong family vacation.  After shooting 2000 pictures and 200 video clips on $15 worth of floppy diskettes during the trip, I want to say this is a great camera.  The film developing costs saved on this trip alone could have paid for the camera!The mpeg movies are a great feature.I almost settled for the FD85, I'm glad we didn't because of extra features gained.  This camera is smaller and cheaper than the FD95, and smaller than our \"good\" SLR - but a bit bigger than the average point and shoot.The FD90 works completely auto with the full range of point and shoot features found on our similarly priced SLR, or you can \"cursor\" through the on-screen menus and set a number of options including exposure and white balance. The \"AE program button\" allows you to quickly select \"twilight mode\", \"twilight plus mode\", \"landscape mode\", \"panfocus mode\" or \"spot light-metering mode\".  The camera has a manual focus ring if you need to use it, and the flash can be set auto, manual on, manual off, or redeye. The camera also has a macro mode. I'm not a professional photographer, so I found myself playing with the manual settings learning what makes for a good photograph.  It is great getting instant feedback on the digital screen. If it didn't work, I just reviewed, deleted and tried again - something I've longed for using our SLR. This camera is as fun as it is useful!  The FD90 is an easy point and shoot - or if you want, you can control some of the action if you are just willing to read the manual and learn the controls.  The camera is capable of more than just point and shoot, but the controls are unique.Did I mention that this camera can also record short videos?No hassle floppy diskettes are almost free these days and are available almost everywhere, only Mavica cameras write directly to them.  Great feature when vacation down south got extended unexpectedly in winter months due to bad weather canceling flights back north. Windows 98/ME/2000 PC users don't need any additional software to view the pictures stored on the floppies - the camera creates an HTML page right on the diskette linking pictures and movies for easy viewing. There is also a freeware utility floating around the Internet specifically written for Mavica owning PC users that will thumbnail your shots if you are into quick website creations. You can zoom into and crop pictures, copy and format diskettes, etc. right on the camera so you don't need a PC to enjoy this camera - especially with the supplied cable that plugs directly into composite inputs on your Television/VCR. Regarding the resolution, I take most of my pictures on the lowest resolutions and they are still good - they print 3 x 5 no problem, even larger with very little distortion. On screen (or my TV with the supplied cable) they are great at the wimpy 640 x 480, especially with the camera in slide-show mode. Plug the camera into a VCR directly and set it on a tripod at family or church events and you have an extra camcorder! It's when you try to \"blow up\" a picture, or digitally zoom into a recorded shot that the extra pixels matter.I did take 20 or 30 pictures at higher resolutions, but rarely the highest.  After visiting with friends who are digital camera owners, a few with 2 mega pixel and higher possibilities, I'm hard pressed to believe most of us care for more than a mega pixel, as evidenced by the popularity of the Mavica FD73 that doesn't even have the ability.  If you are a true photography buff/professional, or have some specialized business need for super clarity, I can see the mega requirement. If you rarely venture beyond 200 speed 35mm film in your SLR, and you rarely deviate from dropping your film off at the local supermarket for developing doubles on 4 x 6 with an index print, lets be realistic. For me the pictures are for memories rather than for artistic impression, and with this camera I get hundreds where I used to get dozens. With the manual features I can tinker with art when so inclined. I almost forgot to mention the solarize, B&W, Sepia, and Neg.Art effects.Why not perfect?  Well, the shutter hesitation does take some getting used to, and the camera seems to struggle a bit in low lighting - although I'm not convinced I just haven't learned how to manually compensate with so many available options. I believe there is also an optional external flash. Lenses, external charger(s), memory sticks etc. are also available for this camera at an additional cost.Oh, ya, this camera makes MPEG movies, up to 60 sec of audio/video per 1.44 diskette in the low-res mode!  We researched several cameras, and I am very pleased with this purchase.  I think the Mavica FD90 has the best mix/compromise of digital camera features.  For me the FD90 has set the standard for all others to compare.  Sony has done it right.", "Date": "December 28, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Thom Fitzpatrick", "ReviewID": "R26TOG20IC7K0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hemmed and hawed for quite a while before making the plunge to buy a digital camera.  I wanted something to use for online auctions, and take pix to use on my web site.  I had been taking analog pix, getting them developed, scanning them, and tossing them in a box.  I was going to get the FD-73, but decided I might want higher resolution, so I stepped up to the FD-90.  Wow!  The #1 selling point for me was the floppy disk storage; friends of mine have cameras with cables and whatnot, and it seems like a big pain.  I like not being tied to a proprietary hardware and software interface.  I can take pix in the car, and unload them at home, work, or at a friend's house.  If I need more \"film\" I can stop at any supermarket or office supply store and pick up a box of floppies.  Just this weekend, I took some pix of a car that a friend was selling, then just handed him the floppy to take home and upload to his own computer.  Now the kicker: this camera has MPEG movie capability, which I wrote off as a \"well, that's cool, but I probably won't use it\" feature.  I couldn't have been more wrong - that's the coolest thing about this camera!  In addition to the pix I took of the car, I also created a \"walk-around\" video as well! Downsides?  The zoom control is kinda awkward being on the front; they should have left it on the back, so you could work it with your thumb while working the shutter.  It takes a great deal of dexterity to work the zoom while shooting a movie.  The camera should also ship with the longer-life battery that's available as an option.  And they should ship some sort of protective case with it.", "Date": "November 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good camera, not as good as its predecessor", "Author": "jeninmaine", "ReviewID": "R1HJGGY1KI49K3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own the MVC FD-88, which was the camera model just before the FD-90.  I have to say I prefer the FD-88, which is unfortunate as Sony seems to have  just stopped making it.My major beefs with the FD-90 are first that you  can only recharge the battery in the camera.  This really stinks.  I hate  having to place an expensive piece of equipment on a shelf while it acts as  a $20 battery charger.  What a waste.  The FD-88 came with a nice seperate  charger, which actually took up LESS room than the equipment included with  the FD-90, and you could go out and take pictures with a second battery  while the first charged.  Can't do that any more.Secondly, the FD-90  pauses and freezes the image while you're focusing to shoot, which is  really disorienting to me.  Not to mention it doesn't get the fine-tuning  in auto-focus on close-up subjects, even using the Macro option.  I was  really disapponted in that.I've used the FD-88 a lot, and the FD-90 was  a new toy to try out (my company bought it).  I would have to say that I  would wait on buying this camera until the \"nest best thing\" came  out.", "Date": "July 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "Fabulous camera - easy to use - great fun!", "Author": "J. Morgan \"joelmor\"", "ReviewID": "R3H41J4DGI2TXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the model that the FD 90 replaced, the FD88 and I have been using it for about a year. I feel I can review the FD90 because it is so similar to  the FD88,  and is an improvement over mine in a few important respects. The  cameras are identical otherwise, except that Sony has made the FD90 into  1.6 megapixel instead of 1.3. This increases the resolution for larger  prints and when you compress them (say to e-mail), they won't be grainy.  Sony has also added their memory stick capability - a great feature. Let me  tell you about my FD88 and since the FD90 is even better, you can judge for  yourself. The Sony Mavica FD88 is a terrific digital camera, especially for  someone new to the genre and not necessarily extremely Computer literate.  It takes great shots and the floppy disk storage medium is very easy to use  and download to your PC. While its rated 1.3 million pixels is not as high  as some other high level models from other manufacturers, in reality not  too many people are going to appreciate much of a difference; the pictures  look great, crystal clear, and very professional. Since the FD90 is  improved in several respects over an already terrific camera, including  somewhat higher resolution (1.6 million pixels), the FD90 has to be a real  winner. The memory stick capability is an added bonus - especially if you  buy the memory stick-floppy disk converter. Then you can store literally  dozens of shots.

Since then I have bought several Sony Mavica cameras, each better than the last! The FD90 is simply great - easy to use for beginners, and full of features for advanced users. The floppy disk system is INCREDIBLY useful - you go to someone's house and simply hand them the disk when you're done taking pictures of the birthday or anniversary. No special cables, no bizarre devices necessary. You *always* have floppies available somewhere to buy, even on vacation.Short MPEGs are fantastic too - there are many times that I've been at a zoo or event and just wanted to take a short clip to show how something moved, or to get a kiss or something.

You don't find this zoom on all digital cameras.2. The save/display with floppies is much faster than with the memory stick.. memory stick is hands down better for taking a bunch of pictures, but if you are in a quick moving situation, switch to the floppies, and expect 6-10 pictures per disk on a medium resolution.4. Love the mini movies you can do with this camera. 5. Love the easy to use features, easy to turn the flash on and off, and easy to try and help get better pictures in low light conditions.6. Yes, it does take 4-5 minutes to download the memory stick pictures... but as someone that has spent HOURS scanning a 24 roll of regular film, this is really no big deal.7.

There is no reason for it to even have the 640 X 480 or email resolutions, the pictures are horrible. In those resolutions, the subject has a \"halo\" around it or them, the faces looked wrinkled and the picture is of overall poor quality.

I can easily show the flaws on a coin or a baseball card.As for reliablity, AI have taken thousands upon thousands of shots with my FD90 over the last 3 years with no mechanical problems whatsoever.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "MY 3rd MAVICA", "Author": "Dick Letrich", "ReviewID": "R12FYDSLHDT3QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The FD-90 is a fine camera.I have owned the FD-81 and the FD-88 and they were also excellent.In fact they were totally trouble free. However the FD-90 had a few problems and had to be sent in for Warranty Repair. In the first 3 months that I owned the camera it went in 3 times for the same repair and I lost nearly all summer (50+ days) to take photos. Sony Warranty Service stinks! I'm sure that now that you have read this you will not be so anxious to purchase the FD-90, but outside of the fact that my camera had a problem they could or would not quickly repair, now that I have it back it is everything that I wanted. Take the time to read all of the reviews and you will agree that this is one heck of a camera..", "Date": "October 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "NICE CAMERA", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1AUQEKO6L476V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a beginner and have had the camera for about 1 week. Can acquire awsome photographs. I plan on using the camera for acquiring copies of text documents and photographs. It is next to impossible to carry a 'scanner'  with you on your genealogy trips. So far the only problem I have with  acquiring these copies is the reflection from the itmes being copied. Have  to get at an angle that results in some ampount of distortion but by taking  a little time good copies can be obtained.
