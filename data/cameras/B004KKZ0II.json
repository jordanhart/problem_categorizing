{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for candid, event, and wildlife photography", "Author": "Martin", "ReviewID": "R3V5LP5R0KKELP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this at Costco, so maybe this review won't get printed, but if it does, here goes.  I own and still love the ZS-3 and the ZS-7 and have taken tons of images with both.  The ZS-10 is a small step backwards in image purity but a big step forward in usefulness.  When I want to take a single image of a still life subject in difficult lighting conditions such as backlighting or very high contrast, the 3 or the 7 will yield more reliable results.  In those conditions, the 10 sometimes shows some purple fringing or neon borders; not enough to make the images unusable, but remarkable simply because those defects almost never happen with the 7 or the 3.  But most of my photography doesn't involve still subjects in high-contrast lighting.  I take pictures of the grandson playing with the dog, or of speakers and performers at an event, or of faces in a crowd in a public place, or of birds in nature.  In those situations, the high-speed full-frame burst mode of the 10 opens the door to photo satisfaction in a way that the older models never could.  When the kid takes the ball from the dog's mouth, the action takes just a second, and with the older models my chances of hitting the perfect moment are statistically slim.  With the 10, I can be taking 5, 10, 40 or even 60 full-resolution frames during that second, and I'm going to capture the perfect combination of facial expression and hand position to convey the magic of the moment.  When talking heads speak, the motion of their faces makes all kinds of grimaces, and if I only have one or a few snapshots, I may have nothing that I can print without making the speaker look like a fool.  With the 10's fast burst mode, I have options; I can make the speaker or performer look at their best.  If I were a news photographer in the thick of action, this is the camera I'd want in my shirt pocket.  I also like to to take bird pictures.  Birds rarely sit still, and if I can only squeeze off a few shots, I may not get the ideal pose with the head forward or sideways and an eye clearly visible.  With the high speed burst mode in the 10, I get my choice of bird postures.  And did I mention the zoom?  I can get perfectly printable shots at the 21x zoom, the equivalent of a 504 mm telephoto lens.  The digital zoom takes it out to 84x, longer than 1000 mm; and while shots at that range look like an Impressionist filter was applied, and won't win too many photo contests, they are good enough to accurately identify the bird, or the person, or the object.  I recently sold my digital SLR outfit with lenses up to 1000mm and I don't miss it at all.  What you can do with this combination of burst and zoom, and in a package of this size, is mind-boggling.  And it does a completely satisfactory job with ordinary landscapes, sunsets, flowers, street scenes, family snapshots, and the like.  In short, Panasonic's switch to the high-speed CMOS sensor in the 10 does mean a small sacrifice in image quality in nasty lighting situations, but a big gain in usability.  The 10 reliably gives me usable images, images that capture precious moments, that are worth printing, and that people love, in situations that were a photographic crapshoot until the 10 came along.  To me, that's a big plus in photo satisfaction.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "POOR low light pics, even after FW update (SEE PICS)", "Author": "MariaSmiles", "ReviewID": "R3N1BVMBY6DUEG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my fifth Panasonic digital camera, (my eighth digital camera of any brand if you don't count 6 or 7 camera-phones - I like gadgets). I have Panasonic's FZ-28 and just sold my pretty blue ZS-7 to a relative needing a great camera, as I was anticipating this year's model to be even better. I wish I had read the reviews first. Once I did, I was really disappointed, so I ended up buying a Sony HX5V first, since it was only 189 bux and had similar features and was touted to have good low-light performance. I take a lot of low-light pics, so this is a feature I always look for. The Sony pics came out pretty good, but I really missed the Panasonic interface (it just made more \"sense\" to me & obviously, I was used to it), and the longer zoom (16x vs 10x on the Sony). After a few weeks with the Sony, I took another look at the ZS-10. I found that there had been two firmware updates since the initial release, one which claimed to improve detail. I fell in love with the brown, and took a leap of faith. It arrived and boy, is it gorgeous! The touchscreen is cool, but not totally needed (not totally implemented, either), but that's ok, as the idea of smearing up my LCD with fingerprints, or accidentally touching the screen all the time didn't really appeal to me.A few days in, I decided to compare apples-to-apples. I set up a little \"still life\" and took some shots with the Sony and some with the Panasonic, using the same (as much as possible) settings and lighting on each shot, both, before the firmware update, and after (on the ZS-10). I lowered both cameras to 5 megapixels (I usually use this setting). I took some with flash, without flash, and in low-light (60W bulb, diffused, 8' away) and very low light (dark room, with only hall light filtering in) - I wanted to push the boundaries and see what happens - almost any camera can take a good picture on a bright, sunny day. I used the auto modes, the tripod modes (with a tripod), the handheld modes (handheld), the twilight modes, even the self-timer to reduce blur from shutter button presses. I did not use the manual modes (M, S, A, P), as the Sony only has M & P, and I usually take very quick shots in varied environments and do not have time to \"fiddle\" with settings, like I do when I use my wonderful FZ-28. I am saddened to report that the Sony HX5V beat the Panasonic ZS-10 hands-down. Really saddened (see photos and notes in the Product Images section, Brown color version). I don't care that the Sony costs less money, or that the batteries cost less money (I always buy two), or that it's smaller, or that there's no play/shoot switch (just hit the shutter), or that the panorama mode is super-cool and easy, or that it has a directional thingie with the GPS to tell you what direction you're facing, I REALLY wanted the Panasonic to beat it. Unfortunately, to my eyes, and for my purposes, it does not. I'm so bummed.PROS (things I care about):- gorgeous brown exterior color- stereo mics in sensible place (rarely covered by fingers when recording)- 16x optical zoom (more, in some modes)- compact (considering all the features)- cool GPS implementation with landmarks already inputted- 30 SCN (scene) modes - these are great when you want a certain \"look\" to your pics, but don't have time to change the settings (or aren't familiar with them) - the icons are in color, now.- CUST (custom) setting on dial, so you can set your favorite settings for a frequent scene- tripod socket in the middle = more well-balanced on weaker/smoother tripods (the sony's is on the edge)- the battery/card door 'springs' open when unlocked (this makes it easier to access contents with one hand)- did I mention the gorgeous brown wrapper?This camera has many more features (3D, 10fps burst shooting, face detection, face recognition, etc.) that are cool, but not important to me, so I did not include them in my PROs, or in my review, as I don't even use them.CONS (things that bother me):- disgraceful IQ in very low-light (I realize this is not an SLR, but it's really bad, even when compared to the older, cheaper Sony)- awful IQ/inexcusably high noise in low light (light from a 60W bulb, diffused, 8 feet away)- low-light modes \"hidden\" in sub-menus (the sony has two, right on their dial) - may be possible to assign one to the CUST (custom) setting on the dial- even when using flash, image is \"blown out\" (compared to the Sony)- solid colors appear grainy, image appears fuzzy (even when viewing at 62% - full-screen). I didn't even bother pixel-peeping - the horror!Yes, there are fewer CONS, but these are higher on my \"priority\" list and Image Quality is more important than where the tripod socket was placed, etc. After all, I show my photos to many people, but I'm the only one who really looks at my camera.I am so disappointed and I feel so let down by the 2011 \"travel zoom\" camera department over at Panasonic. I know they \"owe\" me nothing, but I feel I have been a great customer and have now been presented with a poor product (when the previous version was fantastic). I have heard the ZS-8 has better IQ (fewer \"bells & whistles\" & a different sensor), I might have to try it out. But, right now, I feel so upset that my beautiful brown camera is only pretty on the outside, especially once the sun goes down.As much as it pains me to say this, (especially after being a Panasonic Lumix fan for so many years), my recommendation, for now, would be to look into other cameras. There are other, lower cost cameras that take better pictures and have some of the \"ooohhh-aaahhh\" features this ZS-10 has. Even if you don't take a lot of low(er) light photos, the IQ when using the flash really concerns me (when compared to the Sony), and, considering the high cost, I don't even think this would be a good \"barbecues and birthday parties\" camera. Unfortunately, there are many reputable reviews on the web that report the same findings. I was hoping they just got a \"bum\" camera.I really want to love and utilize this camera, and I am certainly not a professional photographer, so if you have any practical advice or tips which may improve my low-light results with this camera, (other than increasing the light in the image) please leave your tips in the comments section of this review. Even if it is months from now, as other low-light users may find them helpful. Thanks!I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner.

I have owned Panasonic's TZ1, TZ5, ZS3, ZS6.  The ZS6 was a disappointment regarding low light image quality.  I purchased the ZS10 after I looked at the new specs, and saw that they changed the sensor and added the Handheld Nightshot Mode.  This new model is amazing!  The low light photos are clean and have low level noise as compared to the ZS6 and ZS3.  I was able to use manual mode as well to accomplish some tricks in the field, such as smoothing a waterfal while maintaining the proper scene exposure.  I love the other  mode settings I can manipulate, such as the white balance and easier EV settings.  I've gotten some great shots with that, including improved food shots in Aperture Priority Mode, over using the scene selection for Food, which turned out a little blurry (which may be my fault of being too close).  The lense quality is simply amazing.  The detail in the photos is remarkable.  I would highly recommend this camera.

I am posting here because of the excellent reviews that I gave the ZS3 and then the ZS7 that I purchased through Amazon.  I do not change those reviews, and either is a 5-star camera. The ZS10 IS NOT.I just wanted to alert buyers that the ZS10's image quality drops significantly from the ZS7 (which dropped from the ZS3 before it).  I can no longer recommend this camera as the best compact on the market.My number one priority in a camera is image quality, secondary to versatility. I love the zoom on these cameras. but not at the expense of IQ.The ZS10 Image Quality is average at best. There is noticable noise at anything above 300. Night shots (which look great with the ZS3 for example) here are washed out and very noisy. The new \"night shot\" auto setting is equally poor. There is noticable corner fringing, and vignetting from 24 - 28mm.More importantly, the ZS10 has poor contrast -- with both older model ZS3 and ZS7, you can at least get enough contrast between sky/buildings (for example) that you can still get cloud detail in the final shot. Here that is not so -- the camera is unable to do anything but wash out your sky and give you large swaths of white which are not savable in post-processing. I've tried all the in-camera tweeks for this, and it's just a no-go.I do not recommend this as a solo travel camera if you are looking for high quality images, especially for landscapes or street photography. It's great for people photos, etc -- but ironically, you can do that with ANY snapshot camera. The ZS10 image quality spoils this as an upgrade. Stick with either the ZS7, or the older ZS3.

We are casual photographers and have no desire to use the manual features, thus all of our usage was on the automatic setting.  Controls are straightforward and easy to use with little or no need to consult the written guide or the online manual.  Photos turned out crisp and clear both indoors with flash and outdoors in sunlight and dusk; colors are bright.  Photos at full optical zoom are terrific quality (a real difference from our former point and shoot camera).  There is no recognizeable shutter lag, another nice upgrade for us.  The 16x optical zoom is an amazing feature on such a small camera, and the Leica lens is huge plus.  Our Mac iPhoto handled the camera's download without any fuss and with no additional software to install.Overall we find this camera to be jam-packed with features and a good value for the money, even though there were plenty of competitors in its class that would have cost less.  I would buy this one again if we had to do it over.  We selected the red version and like the color and the styling as well as the functionality.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix scores again", "Author": "R. Overall", "ReviewID": "R125FO1P6MG7W2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned several Panasonic Lumix cameras in the last 10 years, upgrading periodically when new feature(s) make it economical to buy newer models.  I still use my FZ50 professionally, upgraded from an FZ20 to a 35 to the 50.  Wanting a point-and-shoot, but something more than snaps, for my personal life, I went to the Lumix.  The ZS series has been excellent.  For personal work, I don't want to spend a lot of time setting up shots, and I'm more likely to want quick reaction to capture a fleeting moment or motion.  No point-and-shoot (p&s;) will be excellent at that, but that doesn't mean I can't get one that does well in a majority of situations.  My Lumix ZS3 performed exceptionally well for a p&s;, and the ZS7 did even better.  So looking over the specs of the ZS10, I decided to buy one.  While I rarely use the video feature (I was raised on still photography!), much improved in this model, I wanted quality for stills.  16X zoom (to 21 with some kind of electronic extender option) up from 12X, and 14.1 megapixels up from 12.1.  Improved antishake (at my age it's very useful), and GPS (which eats battery, can be turned off, but is occasionally useful for verifying sources), and other software I will continue to try out.  So far so good, with crisp photos in most situations.  Still is only good, not great, in low light; is better at eliminating motion blur (CMOS instead of CCD), and the easy menu help make this a worthy upgrade.  Flash is still basic minimal (about 8 feet), typical of a p&s.;  Uses the same battery as the ZS3, so didn't have to buy new ones.  Mini-USB plug (at camera) to standard USB plug is also typical.  I invested in SanDisk Ultra cards (Class 6), and they work well.  My 8 Gb says it will take 2800 pictures at 12.1 Mp.  I don't think I'll ever reach that number, preferring to upload to my computer regularly, but it's nice to have spare capacity.  The ZS10 has an SDXC host software, so can take the new BIG cards (48 and 64 Gb), but their high cost makes them uneconomical currently for me.  Still, nice to have the capability (NOTE: lots of cautions say NOT to put an SDXC card in an SD/SDHC camera that DOES NOT have an SDXC host software).  So instead bought a moderately expensive Extreme Pro SDHC (Class 10) 32 Gb card, and in this camera the irritating lag between pictures (typical in nearly all electronic cameras) was shortened noticeably.  That's nice!  The ZS10 will run SD, SDHC, and SDXC, so my legacy cards are still fine.  From a first day testing perspective, the ZS10 has shown its mettle, an improvement (significant, if not huge) over the ZS3, and in most situations where a personal camera is useful, takes excellent pictures, and has a reasonably useable menu.  I like my blue one.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Took surprisingly sharp pictures", "Author": "Lottie", "ReviewID": "RLH6XR33OLMOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took it on a trip, where I mainly used the Intelligent Auto.  I was impressed that this function detects when red-eye and fill-in flash is needed.  Even with flash turned off, the exposure compensated quite well.  Plant and people pictures were quite vivid and sharp, even in breezes.  I did overexpose one people-shot, but just one.As I expected, taking pictures of far-away, partially hidden,or fast-moving animals in forest where of course, vegetation in front is going to throw off the focus, was indeed difficult.  Much of my animal shots were were obtained by an experienced guide shooting them through a scope, and these also turned out surprisingly well. Animal shots in nature take a lot of practice, finding the animal in wide angle first, then gradually going with the zoom.  Just touching the portion of the screen where the animal is to take the shot can be helpful where there's no time for that.  I took a number of accidental photos by touching the screen, but you just waste digital electrons.The camera definitely could use a viewfinder.

I use cameras mainly for concerts and have one coming up in 2 weeks so will revisit this review at that time.  That being said, I have tested this out mainly indoors and a few outdoors and it takes really decent pictures for what I need it for.  I love how I can put it to touch screen and touch the focus of the picture on screen and have it snap a quick picture.  The focus/shutter time is fast so you don't miss your shot.  I have played around with the GPS a bit but only indoors so it just brought up the county I live in.  I mainly bought the camera with GPS for when we go to Hawaii in a few months.  It will be a nice feature so as I go back through the photos at a later date I will know where I was.  I love how you can enter your pet or child's name and date of birth and it tags the photos for you with name and exact age.  This is the first Panasonic I have ever bought and so far I'm pretty happy with it.  I am coming from a Canon SD4500 in which the zoom and battery life suck.  A dead battery after 83 pictures and 2 hours is not acceptable to me no matter what setting you have it on (which I had it on auto).  So far on this camera the zoom is a 10!!  I love being able to see items clearly that are pretty far away!!  I can't yet rate the battery fairly as I haven't really tested the camera out to the fullest.  I will udate this review in a few weeks after using it at the concert.  I have bought an extra battery just in case it is needed, but I'm hoping it's not.4/11/11::Update:  I really used this camera this past weekend at a concert.  I love this camera!  It took really good pictures (to my content) and had awesome zoom!  The concert started at 7 and at 10:00 pm the battery had one bar left on it.  I wish I would have let it run out to see how long it really would have lasted but I put in the second battery I purchased instead.

Before this camera I had zs3 from 2009 and was very happy with it. I used it so much in the last 2 years so it practically died from overuse. It was dropped a dozen times, got completely wet once and stopped working but resurrected itself after 3 days... finally last fall the lens mechanism stopped responding i think from getting in contact with sea water and sand (I used the camera almost every day so this was bound to happen).So, zs10 is my replacement and I have to disappoint those who expect the image and video quality improve on this new model. I've compared 720p Motion Jpeg video of zs10 with the same format of zs3 (2009) and prefer the zs3 samples. The difference is not huge, they are just a little sharper but that camera was manufactured 3 years ago! Same goes for the picture quality, there is no visible improvement at all. At least it's not worse.I tried to find some advantages of this new model so not to get completely dissatisfied and calmed myself down with following cool improvements:-it's faster, it focuses quicker so in situations where you're trying to take a picture of a fast moving object you are well equipped.-zoom is more powerful and it's the camera's best feature.-you have more manual control over photos (BUT not the videos) so you can play with depth of field and exposure.-in video mode you're able to re-focus during recording by half pressing the shutter button (it works especially great with \"continuous focus\" switched off).(don't really care about the GPS and 3D-picture functions. screen resolution difference isn't noticeable. touchscreen isn't all that useful it actually is an obstacle sometimes because touching it by accident can result in a picture being taken. slow motion is not that impressive at 320x240 resolution. 1080i AVCHD mode's quality didn't seem better from MJPEG 720p)disadvantages over zs3 (which is 2 years older, remind you):-you won't be able to use (cheaper) batteries not made by Panasonic-battery life is shorter even with GPS off.-all photos/videos look sharper on ZS3-priceNo one should really compare this camera to a model from 2008, so before you buy it compare it with current models from other competitors. I recommend this camera to people with loose cash and low standards for image quality, who want a fast performing, long-zoomed pocket camera. It's a nice toy.----------------Update: after 2 weeks of use I am truly Annoyed with this camera. I bought it in US but currently in Europe and therefore can't return it. I would gladly sell it for 70% of what i paid for it.I found out that:1. 24mm widescreen is only used for taking photos. When you shoot videos the screen is heavily cropped and you lose about one third of the width.2. None of the manual controls can be used in video mode.3. Video Stabilization only works with AVCHD video format.I chose this camera over Canon SX230 mainly for:ability to shoot in Motion Jpeg format,better widescreen andmanual controls.Well as i mentioned above I found out that none of these features can be used in video mode and Motion Jpeg mode is  useless due to very poor stabilization.I will Never buy another Lumix.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Took great photos in Alaska", "Author": "Mary Beth Domaz \"Lovestotravel\"", "ReviewID": "R2TXBVDGAM8TJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a point and shoot camera with good zoom.

The automatic setting might not do it for you, but one of the many mode settings should. The only negative I have found is the battery life. My husband's old Canon P&S; lasts all day. I typically go through three batteries for an all day scenic cruising. I would like to disable the touchscreen but I am not sure yet if that is possible. So far I haven't figured out how.

I just don't understand the negative reviews on this camera.  I am no professional photographer, however, I have been taking all sort of pictures over the years, from the old 35mm to the larger and more expensive DSL cameras and I think this Panasonic DMC-ZS10 is an outstanding camera for the money.  First of all, OK, it is not a perfect world, we just cannot buy any one item that serves all our needs so, having said that, let me simply say that I bought this camera for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  She sets it on the \"Intelligent Mode\" and never looks back.  This thing is truly amazing.  I love to take macro shots, however,on other cameras I have, you must adjust every time you go from one mode to another.  Shooting in the \"Intelligent Mode\" makes it very simple to go from a shot of a mountain range to an extreme close-up of a small flower.  You do nothing but hold on to the camera and fire away.  It figures out that it must shoot in \"Macro Mode\" and sets the camera with the shooter doing nothing but pressing halfway down on the shutter, allowing the auto-focus to kick in and shoot.  Believe me, this is great for those who only want outstanding high quality pictures and do not wish to keep fiddling with the camera.  I just do not understand the few negative reviews.  We all have our opinions and that is exactly what these reviews are all about so, for my money, we are absolutely delighted and unless it falls apart in the next few weeks, I would not even consider giving it anything but five stars.  OK, granted, I have not shot in all modes nor do I intend to offer some in depth opinion and evaluation about this camera.  Let me just say that I think it is an excellent choice and certainly the perfect camera for those who could care less about all the other great modes.  If you want to use them, they are there and they seem to be outstanding.  It comes down to spending your time fiddling with all the available options when trying to get that quick shot or simply using the \"Intelligent Mode\" and firing away.  Many like to keep it simple.

The Picture quality of the Leica lens doesn't cease to amaze me.The change in the layout of the menu was quite confusing in the beginning, but I'm slowly getting used to where everything is.The touchscreen, although not required for this camera, i.e. happy to have accepted an enhancement to another feature and you can pretty much get by without touching the screen, is a welcome change because it introduces focal-point focus, active-zoom and scrolling.The battery life isn't great if you take pictures with the flash on the whole time, i.o.w. don't expect it to last for more than 200 shots at night.  During the day though, you could easily take 1000 pics, and still have some battery left.  My solution to the battery life was simply to purchase a second battery; a generic one worked for me, but make sure you buy it from a reputable vendor if you follow that route.Lastly, it's a great camera if you're an intermediate photographer, i.e. some days you want to point and shoot, and other days you really want to get into some of the finer photographic techniques.  It is by no means a replacement for a DSLR, but the quality of the pictures really come close.  Ultimately, it's the combination of your skillful eye and the camera that delivers amazing pictures, and sometimes it's just dumb luck.  If you're adventurous, try the different camera modes to see how truly amazing the camera is.For your benefit, outside of the USA, this camera is known as the DMC-TZ20.Hope this helps, Regards Ashton.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix DMC-ZX10 vs Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V", "Author": "GMann \"GManning\"", "ReviewID": "R3FGEK6O7ENW3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought both and tried them out for several weeks.  I returned both, but leaned towards the Panasonic - here's why.  put up alot of beach pics, go there to see the great outdoor quality if you'd like)Panasonic - good:Great zoom (can digitally go to 141 x !  use a tripod and the pics are very good.Great outside pics, crisp, clear, just beautiful.Solid build, easy to navigate and operate. No electrical connections were exposed, had covers.Battery was easy to charge, had its own small, separate charger.Took me awhile, but I was able to get some really nice pics of a bright moon.The video was very clear, high quality, but the sound was a little tinny. The zoom lens would make noise while using it in video mode, unless you're very light fingered.Panasonic -  not so good:Inside shooting was pretty poor. The flash concentrated the light vs spreading it out.My $50 Samsung has an amazing flash compared to the $250+ PanasonicUnless you were outside, facial pictures were just awful. Turned people pink, no matter what setting I tried.Battery life so-so, but no big deal, just buy a spare, it's very small.Has scene modes, but some don't work at all. I was at the beach, put it on beach scene, and all the pics came out way too bright. The landscape mode was too bright, had to use sunset for the majority of the outdoor pics (to be able use the 141x zoom).If the majority of your pics are outside, it is a great little camera, and a powerful zoom is a delight. Even driving at 55, in a convertible, it captured great zoom pics, so action pics are easy.  But if you do alot of inside pics, even for stuff to sell on Ebay, it just doesn't handle the low lights well (the macro was clear, but the colors off).Sony - goodThe colors were actually better than the Panasonic, a little richer. Both have the ability to change the hues, but the Sony was a little crisper, with side by side comparisons.Zoom is very good, but not as long as the PanasonicThe video was great, as well as the sound - incredible stereo sound. It records it as a .mst file, not the easiest to work with, for me at least.Had a good textured grip for shooting.Sony -  not so goodI didn't like where the connections were so exposed to dirt, dust.You have to charge the battery in the camera, and that takes 270 minutes !The one door it has, for the hdmi, is so flimsy, I thought it was broken. I was afraid to open it again.It took pretty good low light pics inside, but the flash is just way too powerful. Unless your subject is 30 feet away, they'll get washed out.The flash is positioned terribly !  Most people shoot with 2 hands, and fingers/thumbs on the 4 corners. The flash pops up and 99% of the time your left index finger is over it. It's an accident waiting to happen. It's going to stop popping up after awhile.Conclusion, why I didn't buy either:Both take great pics outside. But for that much money, both should do low light and have a flash that works properly.  I hate the Sony pop up flash that kept jamming me, so much, I wouldn't buy it just on that.  The Panasonic felt more solid, and since it was about par with inside shots, I'd get it for the zoom, the build, the ease of use, and great outside pics.  Maybe I'm picky, but I want a camera to work well inside as well as outside, without having to try and figure the fstop, white balance, iso, etc.  If you've read this far, hope this helps.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doing its job quite well - I am Satisfied", "Author": "C.

However when I wanted to deal with a bit more challenging scenarios (e.g. back-light compensation, non-centered focusing) I needed much more RTFM (and actually did not find answers to all of my questions).For me - it certainly deserves the extra cost.

This is the only one out of the last 6 that we would buy again if we had to.Make sure you get the upgraded firmware (version 1.2 as of this writing) installed... it really makes a big difference in picture quality and the useability of the GPS features.  Panasonic doesn't exactly make this easy, but it is worthwhile.For starters, this camera is fast.  Fast startup, fast focus, fash flash charging, fast switches from photo to video, fast switches between shooting modes, and fast times between shots.  If you have a decent memory card, most of these things work better, as would be expected.  If you put a cheap, slow card in a good camera, you get the lowest common denominator level of performance... so get a good card.Some of the criticism on here complains about the picture quality.  I think they either have old firmware, or are blowing up wall murals, because the quality, for normal usage, is superb.  If you're sharing photos with friends or printing out standard sized photos for personal or business use, you will be very happy with this camera.  Colors are rich, the pics are sharp, and the fast sensor captures motion very well.  Even low-light pictures work out well if you take them properly:Tip:  For low-light pictures, don't use the built-in night-shot capabilities unless you are using a tripod and the delay timer (to negate the shiver effect of pushing the shutter button... this camera is fast, and takes the photo when you push the button)... for hand-held low-light photos, we found it best to use the touchscreen feature, and tap where we wanted the camera to focus and shoot.  We got very good shots using this method in really poor lighting conditions.  When using the built in scene modes, they weren't as good.Outdoor shots were great, and the excellent lens lets you get the wide shot, or zoom in for very good detail (without the distortions of a digital zoom on a lesser camera).  Use the touch screen again for the zoom to get in and out with one tap.Switching to video was as easy as pushing a single button, and its starts recording immediately, so you can capture shots that the other cameras will miss.  Video even works well with the zoom and the touchscreen focusing function.Overall, my only complaint is the batteries.  Battery life was good (around 300 shots each charge with most of the features enabled), but extra batteries are very expensive as Panasonic chips theirs and the camera won't work with generics, even if they are the right specs otherwise.

There are conflicting comments about the image quality of ZS-10, but I took a gamble. I sold my ZS-7 and bought ZS-10.First of all, I like the touch pad feature. Have not tried the 3D feature because I don't have a 3D TV. Panorama assist is better than no panorama. I used free software to stitch photos together, sometimes with special effects provided by the software and I would say the result is better than straight panorama photo. Extra zoom is always welcome.Regarding image quality, I compared two photos of an oil painting taken with ZS-7 and ZS-10 with same lighting and at the same distance using iA mode. Color of ZS-10 is a little softer but barely noticable. ZS-10 photo is smoother than ZS-7. The edge is ZS-10 photo may not be as sharp as ZS-7.  I noticed on ZS-7 photo when I zoomed in there were patterns that I would describe as similar to random small dents on cardboard. I examined the painting and found no such patterns. However, there are regular tiny cloth like patterns you expect from canvas but neither camera captured that.I compared another photos of seaport taken from my building in broad daylight, both wide angle and maximum optical zoom. ZS-10 zooms out a bit more and zooms in a lot more than ZS-7 as expected. Color on both photos are equally good.So I would say these two cameras are both good depending on what you want from them. It is just my two cents.In my last comment, I said image quality of ZS-10 was not as good as ZS-7 based on the zoom in comparison.

First of all it seems that these days ignorance dominates and all it takes to sell a camera to the uninformed consumer is lots of zoom, lots of megapixels, GPS and a big LCD touch screen. 14MP is way too much for the sensor on this camera, no matter what settings you use the pictures always come out blurry especially at night, and if you zoom in even a little bit, your quality decreases DRAMATICALLY! Megapixels only increase the image quality if the sensor can handle it. For instance, if you use a sensor that is only capable of 8 or 10 MP (just an estimate) and then you convert that to 14MP, you're obviously going to lose a lot of quality, and that is what Panasonic is doing with this camera. These cameras can not handle such high MP, yet they (and most other companies) are making cameras like this because they know higher megapixels will appeal to consumers. Somehow it got in peoples heads that more megapixels means better quality, but this is true only if the sensor is good enough, and in this case the sensor is not made to handle 14 megapixels. Beware of the great megapixel swindle, most of these newer point & shoots are junk.Before I got this I was using a Kodak easyshare c743 which is several years older, less zoom, less megapixels and it takes way sharper and more detailed pics than this brand new sleek & fancy Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10. Don't be fooled by looks and high numbers!!I'm returning this in the next couple of days to get an older camera from a different brand, most definitely will not buy another Panasonic after this. 14 Megapixels + small sensor = bad quality images.

The shopsugested this model and a cheaper Canon model. I did not have time to do my homework and research before I bought it.This is my eleventh digital camera and I havent had the opportunity of testing many more. I guess the camera I own that resembles it closest is the LX3, which is very different (might brighter lens, but much less zoom range). The camera I probably use most these days is the EOS 5D mark 2. You can imagine that I wasnt expecting anything near like the performance of the latter.Overall I was pretty happy with it, let me point out a few of the good and not so good points.Actually the low light performance is not so bad for such a small camera, pictures at 400 ASA were sort of usable, somewhat close to the LX3's results here, except that the latter will have a shorter exposure time due to the bright lens.The reviewer who said the low light perfomance is horrible would probably say the same thing about most of those compact digital cameras.The image quality goes down as you zoom, this is hardly surprising, but that doesnt make the long range zoom useless. I suppose I'll post up some pictures on my website and update this review in a short while.The bokeh of the lens is not so pretty when zooming: ie out of focus bright spots end up looking like rings.Shawn Barnett of imaging resource has pointed out that the noise processing loses some fine details which were visible in the pictures of this camera's predecessor.There is no raw mode, oh well, I wont be able to make use of DXO's amazing high ISO processing.Colours are pretty neutral and very satisfying. Pretty inditinguishalble from my DLSR.At wide angles the pictures a pretty sharp, but I really wonder why we are given 14 megapixels, whereas 10 megapixels would probably give you just as good an image, with smaller files.The stabilizer was surprisingly good.The GPS option is quite slow to react to a change of location, there were a few mistakes here, even if I had moved 50 kilometers in a car, it could take 5 minutes to get back in sync. You can leave the GPS on all the time however this consumes battery power, but not so much that you can't leave it on all night.The contrast of the pictures is not as good as my LX3, but then the LX3's lens probably has fewer elements.The camera might take a couple of seconds to power up, but once it's on, it's surprisingly reactive, no complaints here.I found the movie mode very impressive, but I'm not comparing it with many of the other cameras on the market. Very pleased here.As for the user interface, it's very nice to be able to touch the screen and tell it to focus on that detail. You can actually fire the camera this way too, but I did not have too many problems here.I didnt like the panaoram mode that much, I didnt think it helped very much.The flash is rather weak, a bit disappointing.The screen is not as bright as the one on my DLSR's and that can make it hard to see what you are taking if the sun is shining on it.Battery life was good enough for what I was doing, I could shoot for a couple of days between a recharge.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Robbie in Mammoth", "Author": "Robbie", "ReviewID": "R2DEEGV0OM7N8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was purchase from Amazon to replace a DMC-ZS7 with which I was very satisfied.

The ZS3 was the finest shirt-pocket digital camera I have owned. Unfortunately, my ZS3 suddenly had fibers inside the lens - and Panasonic replaced it - with a refurbished camera. The replacement never shot as well as the original - there was a slight difference in some settings, I missed the original. When the ZS7 hit the market, I thought I would wait for the upcoming ZS10 with it's CMOS 16.1 MP sensor.I bought the ZS10 and immediately was very disappointed with the images it produced. It has a better lens and more bells and whistles than I ever needed, but there is something in the software within that cannot produce an image that can be zoomed and cropped after downloading to the computer. I admit to being a pixel-peeper - the ZS3 begged to have the images enlarged and rewarded me with many wonderful crops/zooms. The ZS10 makes beautiful images if you are sharing pics on facebook, just not crisp on a 42 inch plasma.

This is the reference number of the model here in Germany, but it is the DMC-ZS10 elsewhere.I have a lot of experience with Panasonic cameras - my first ,proper' digital was an FZ-5 Superzoom.  I also carry an DMC-FX35 as a pocket camera.  What I wanted though was something with better quality than this for when I didn't have my Nikon dslr with me.I'd heard good things about the TZ-10, but as it was no longer available so the TZ-18 or TZ-22  seemed logical (and must be better - newer technology and all that).  What a disappointment the TZ-22 (ZS10) turned out to be!  It seems like it was that time of year when an update of an old model was due.  How can we improve on the old (last years!) model?  It has an excellent optic already.  Well let's add new things that people don't necessarily need but will show how technically advanced we are?  HD-Video? Touch screen? 3D Function? GPS?...My view: You want HD-Video? Buy a digicam.  Touch-Screen? You can barely see the screen in daylight never mind touch a tiny icon on it.  3D? There's nowhere to display it even if it was worth displaying, you can't print it in 3D.  GPS? If you can't remember where you took the shot it can't have been a memorable thing you want to remember anyway.But at least we still have an excellent still camera?  Sorry, the C-MOS sensor was introduced so that the GPRS and HD-Video were possible.  The still picture quality takes a major hit so that the `new extras' are available.I compared still pictures from the TZ-18 and every time they were sharper and less noisy than it's older brother the TZ-22 (ZS-10).Finally I returned the TZ-22 in exchange for a TZ-18 (the salesman recommended it because it was `close to' the picture quality of the even older TZ-10!).The only difference I miss from the TZ-22 is the scene mode for night pictures that takes several pics in a burst and puts them together to filter out noise.Moral of the story - don't assume every new model is updated for the consumers benefit.All the new `extras' that reduce the picture quality might be worth it one day, when they figure out how to maintain image quality on the C-MOS sensor but right now the TZ-22 is a prototype HD-Video/Still picture Compact.  If you want a good video image buy a Camcorder and if you want a good still picture buy the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 16x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) also known as the TZ-18.

We shopped a lot of these entry level cameras for her replacement and found the layout of Panasonic's Lumix ZS10 to be the most tolerable for her large hands. April of 2011 we purchased a kit and my wife was again able to capture lasting memories. Most of her pictures get printed directly from the camera at Walmart or whatever store is convenient for her and it is not until the card is nearly full that I download its contents. I had noticed poor image quality towards the end of the summer when I downloaded her card for the first time and I blamed the grainy/blurry pictures on settings and user error.Moving forward in September we began tweaking settings and practicing more with the camera to \"learn\" how to take good pictures from it. Three months later, during christmas break we finally came to the sickening realization that our 380.00 camera was never going to function adequately for us. By December of 2011 the horrible product reviews and quality had dropped retail prices to sub 200.00 which proved to me in an unscientific way that this camera is , in my opinion, a piece of junk. Unfortunately I did not discover the shortcoming of this device within a 90 day return window and Panasonic's customer service can only recommend sending it in for inspection.I can only assume that those who have written great reviews for this camera either have low expectations for a digital camera or they have never experienced the superior image quality coming from Canon and Nikon entry level cameras. We have now gotten our repaired Canon AS640 back from a repair shop and the positive difference in image quality coming from our old Canon camera is breathtaking. I would not be stretching things much to say in comparison to the images we are getting from the Canon device that the Lumix ZS10 pictures look like they came from an old 110 compact film camera.\"Learn how to use it\" someone told me... but it's hard to learn how to take good pictures with a bad camera.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "COMPLETE OUTFIT IN YOUR HAND!", "Author": "Stephen R.

The exposure of videos is poor and overall, low light performance is also very poor.  I took a photo of my livingroom under tungster/halogen lighting which came out OK but again with much noise.  Then I made a video of the same room right afterwards under the same lighting conditions and the video was too dark.  This camera also has no exposure compensation for videos.  I read the manual and it clearly indicates that videos are strictly in automatic mode with no exposure control at all by the photographer.  You are at the mercy of the camera.  The Canon PowerShot SX220/230 HS DOES have exposure compensation for videos FYI...The only good thing is that the videos are smooth because of a fast 60fps (interlaced i - not progressive p though).  And having a GPS is just a gimmick and a toy to fool consumers, and does not make the picture quality of this camera any more \"attractive\" or in any way better.Having a Leica lens is not enough because a good digital camera also needs a good image sensor.  The actual sharpness and noise level in the image is determined largely by the sensor.  One can have the best lens in the world and have a poor sensor and the resulting photos and videos will be horrible.  This camera is not worth it!

In other modes, such as aperture priority and shutter speed priority, the zoom range is limited to 3x. Fortunately, the 3x is at the wide angle end of the spectrum and not the tele end, or the camera would be a total disaster. Since I often venture out of auto modes and need control over aperture and shutter speed, this is a severe disappointment.

Based on several trials in locations that were far apart, the GPS can be up to 100 feet off. I have the Samsung CL65 Samsung 12.2 Mp 5X Opt Zoom 3.5IN Ts LCD with Gps Bt Red to be much superior both from the standpoint of GPS accuracy and battery performance.(3) Panasonic has a crusade to \"protect\" the consumer by installing firmware that prevent the consumer from choosing to use an unapproved third-party battery.

No argument there. But for me it wasn't the right choice.Before getting this new DMC-ZS10 I used a Panasonic DMC-FH22 for a couple of years and loved it. Pocket size, big display, light weight, 8x optical zoom. When the camera disappeared from my pocket on a crowded subway, I decided to move up to the DMC-ZS10 in order to get the longer zoom and built-in GPS.What I didn't count on was the increase in size and weight. When you set them side-by-side the two cameras look very similar in dimensions, but the extra quarter inch or so is really noticeable in my pants pocket. And the increase in weight, even more so.Frustrated, I then bought a used DMC-FH22 on Amazon to replace my stolen one, and could not be happier...except that the used one occasionally gives a bogus \"out of memory\" indication. Maybe a firmware upgrade would fix it?One tip for anyone using the DMC-ZS10: If you do not see location information in the EXIF data of your photos, check the video setting of the camera. There are 4 possible video settings, and (as noted in the manual) two of them block location information...even if you are just shooting still photos. That's a weird limitation.One more tip: Fight the urge to take photos of small groups of people using the power-on wide angle lens setting. If you do, the people at the edge of the photograph will be distorted in a most un-flattering manner.

I also purchased a 16GB class 10 SDHC memory card.  I'm comparing this camera to our Canon A710is.  I prefer the size of the Canon because it is easier to grip (even for the wife), but the zoom capability was not adequate for capturing photos of my childrens' sporting events.The overall build quality of the Panasonic is excellent.  Most functions are easily located, though the menu can be complicated for some.  The LCD is large, bright and sharp, but I doubt I'll use the  touchscreen feature.  The camera comes with a stylus for the touchscreen, which can get misplaced rather easily.  There is no viewfinder (sadly, most manufacturers have dropped this feature in the compact zoom category), which makes it much more difficult to frame a photo in direct sunlight.  The camera performs well during outdoor events, but is very grainy for indoor photos, using the auto (iA) setting.  Both my wife and I are novices at photography, so we use that setting the most.  I find the Canon takes far superior indoor photos.Video recording is pretty good.  Recording time is limited to 30 minutes using the default AVCHD setting, which is not immediately recognized by Apple Macs.  The camera will also record with the motion-JPEG format, but is only limited to 2GB file size (regardless of memory card size), which for an HD capture is about EIGHT MINUTES.The color of the camera wasn't important, but when the wife saw it was available in red, she had to have it (she is the primary user).Battery life is nowhere near the 260 photos claimed by the manufacturer.  We can take maybe 100 shots before getting the dreaded flashing battery in the display.  Luckily, I purchased a spare battery, but both perform about the same, so the battery life doesn't appear to be a fluke.Summary:This is a well featured camera for the price (which has dropped $30 since 11/22/2011, when I bought mine).

Great to travel with and a definite must for the photography enthusiast who cannot pack the giant SLR.  There are enough options to keep the avid photographer busy and yet simple enough for a kid to figure out.  The camera is relatively tough, but avoid fine sand and any hard knocks.

Everest Base Camp. I wanted the GPS to track my photo locations, unfortunately GPS is not allowed in the Himalayas of Nepal, the camera reported \"GPS function not allowed in this region\". I did get the GPS to work sometimes when I was in Kathmandu, however I should have tried getting a location before I went site seeing as it took a long time to finally get a position. I had a layover in Hong Kong and the GPS worked flawlessly there when I was outside, it couldn't get a location when I set it by the window in my hotel room. The photos look great, even the ones taken through the airplane windows. In \"intelligent auto\" mode I did run into problems with the auto-focus finding the closest thing and focusing on that, it was a problem when trying to take photos of the mountains through gaps in tree branches, if there was one leaf or twig in the the frame the camera would usually focus on it. Using other modes you can force a focus location which is nice but you need to know how to set the other settings as well. Battery life is very good when not using GPS or flash, GPS kills the battery very quickly though, make sure you have spares and a charger with you if you plan on using the GPS while traveling.My previous cameras are from Olympus, Kodak and Canon. For general shooting the Canon takes better photos, has very good manual controls, but it is old, lacks HDR and is very bulky for its 5x zoom, the Kodak is the worst camera I've ever owned, it is very compact but I have had photos disappear from the memory cards before transferring to my computer and the image quality is very poor, the Olympus has slightly more zoom than this camera but is very bulky, almost compact SLR size, lacks GPS, HDR and long exposure.

It's a good compact - just the right size for quick snapshots.Initially, I had no complaints.  I had shot a few pictures with it around the house, nothing too fancy, and it was good camera.  All told, less than 100 pictures before I took it on vacation in February.About 45 minutes into arriving, disaster.... Camera won't turn on.  OK.  Change the battery, right?  Wrong.  Still won't turn on.When I returned home, I sent it in for repair assuming it was still under warranty and that is where the problems started. As requested, I sent all the appropriate items (batteries, manuals, charger) including a copy of the receipt.Post two-weeks mailing it in, I get a phone call from Panasonic indicating they can't honor the warranty since I had not sent a copy of the receipt.  They want $180 to repair the camera.  Really?  But, that's ok - it probably got lost. No problem - I resent it via e-mail.A few days later, I get another phone call telling me that I had voided my warranty by not taking proper care of the camera.  Took about 10 minutes of discussion to find out what this \"exactly\" meant with me being told initially to go look this up in my owner's manual (which I sent back with the camera).  Finally, after going rounds, I was told the technician indicated the camera had got wet.All told, I had taken less than 100 photos with the camera.  And since it never went out of the house until my vacation (and it died within in the first 45 minutes of that), I'm still trying to figure out how it ever got wet.Obviously, it's my word against theirs and I am sure they get tons of cameras that get soaked and sent in with owners saying the same thing.  However, it was the run-around from them that completely soured the situation.  We had the loss of the initial paperwork, the demand for $$ for a repair, not being up front about their findings and finally, the manager telling me I should buy one of their camera's specifically made to get wet instead.  When I asked if this could be a design defect, I was told that was virtually impossible.So, I'm out a camera.  At least they sent it back and it will be fun to disassemble and see exactly how much corrosion is built up inside (apparently, it was ALOT).So my opinion is to avoid Panasonic at all costs.

Now that I've used both cameras (my wife owns the ZS7), I'd probably get a ZS7 the next time around just because the default point-and-shoot mode produces fewer yellow blotches, and it's more of a struggle to get good low-light pictures (must set 5 manual settings) on the ZS3.These cameras are loaded with features and I've used most of them at one time or another but frankly, many features is NEVER a substitute for clear and detailed pictures, especially at this price point !!!In my opinion, most buyers of the ZS10 would be much happier with either a ZS3, ZS7, or the new Canon SX230 (see studio shots 4th on the list above), as both of the older Lumixes and the newest Canon TravelZoom are much sharper than the ZS10.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot", "Author": "Christopher Edgington \"Edge\"", "ReviewID": "R1336OHSIT1J91", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was initially disappointed with the results I was getting with the camera when I took a few snapshots of my friends.

I want to buy this camera despite some of the negative comments as I think it has a lot of good features. But I will rarely use the full 14MP due to file size. If I shoot at say 10MP resolution, does the camera simply not use some pixels on the outer edges of the sensor, or does it throw away pixels throughout the image by resampling or some other method? Second question, one can easily add noise to an image but is there a way to remove noise that would work something like undoing the add noise filter? Conceptually it seems like noise should be as easily identifiable by algorithm as it is to our eyes. In which case wouldn't it be better shoot at full resolution and apply such filter when downsampling rather than shoot at lower resolution? If you are decreasing resolution anyway why not delete all the pixels tagged as noise first?

GPS and 16X zoom.  Now we are talking.  But as I soon found out, the GPS on the ZS10 didn't work well.  Nothing like an automotive GPS.  When you change locations, say to a different count or state, you have to tell the ZS10 that you did so.  It becomes a pain and I found it difficult if not frustrating to do.  I do like the ZS10's 16X zoom.  It helps pull long distance shots in without using the digital zoom.  (Look it up)  Using digital zoom takes away image quality.  It plays with the pixels.  I will never use it.So far one out of two.  Good zoom but poor GPS.  Did I say that the pic quality of the ZS6 is better than that of the ZS10?  In most cases it is.  My wife, she was using the ZS6 and taking better pics than I was using the ZS10.  So for more than twice the price of the Panasonic ZS6 I got a so so camera. One other thing that is common to both cameras, the view finders are hard to see in bright sun lite.  I use a \"Delkin Devices DU3.0 cover over the viewfinder.

I've  also taken the camera on two trips to Italy and just love its ease of use and the great photographs I've been able to take.Now, planning another trip, I realize that the many, many photographs I have taken must have made my beloved Lumix very \"tired.\"Thus, I decided to buy a newer version to take along with my older one. My new Lumix had added features which I love, such as the 16x FullHD and the GPS. My real love of Panasonic cameras however, comes not just from their technical aspects but from the gorgeous photographs I am able to take.

I did know before I ordered it that it had a touch screen, but I assumed that that 'feature' could be turned off.  If it can, I wasn't able to find the \"off\" button.  I searched the menus.  I read everything I could find about it here and on other sites.  Several people mentioned being annoyed by the fact that accidentally touching the screen either took a picture or moved the focus point, but no one that I found mentioned not being able to disable it altogether.The few pictures I did take with it (intentionally) came out perfectly.  (In fact a couple of the \"camera's choice -- unintentional\" pictures even came out perfectly exposed and focused!)

The TZ20/ZS10 is the updated model of the TZ10 so was the obvious choice (I've had Sony Cybershots in the past, but they proved unreliable and the after-sales service was in my experience not great).TZ20's improvements over the TZ10 are:* Zoom is now 16x, very good for a compact* Touch-screen display, great in concept but not so great in use* HD video in 1080i - it's resource hungry so get a BIG memory card* You get slo-mo video too, if you can find a use for it* A GPS database which actually works, slowly - but warning, if you don't turn it off when you stop using the camera then it will keep working even when the camera is turned off, and drain the battery in a day or soSurprisingly, the still image quality delivered by this latest Lumix is not quite as faultless as its predecessor, especially in poor light. I understand there are complex techie reasons for this: reportedly the use of MOS tech for the sensor offers better video but a slight degradation in still image quality except in bright light. This should not be a deal-breaker for most buyers, as the camera is packed with innovative up-to-the-minute gadgetry and is, overall, outstanding value in a highly competitive market segment.The Lumix hits the jackpot with its superb wide-angle lens and intelligent autofocus features. However, if crisp still image quality - especially in less than perfect lighting conditions - is your number one priority, then you might consider looking at rival products: in this important respect it's good but not outstanding. For me, I could take or leave the touch-screen facility too, as I find it annoying to use - but that's just a personal preference, and many buyers will no doubt love it.In summary: a good compact, packed with features, with excellent lens and top-of-the-line video, but let down slightly by still image res under certain conditions. Still good value, though: three years ago, you couldn't buy a camera this capable, and packed with all these features, for this kind of money - and now you can.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality", "Author": "Claudio Hadid", "ReviewID": "R1JGYRMPMOP1H5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nothing to complain about image quality and HD video.

There are certainly lots of features (takes better part of day to review Panasonic on-line feature summary and the electronic user manual.The IA mode certainly lives up to its promo's and delivers great picture compositions for most snapshots; and you can select from many other manual or semi-auto modes to meet most scene criteria.  The Handheld Night Shot mode does a nice job of enhancing low light shots IF you select this mode manually (but camera does not seem to select this feature when using the IA mode, as the instructions seem to imply it will).Although I did not purchase this camera for its GPS feature, the GPS is the arguably the most disappointing feature.  It takes a long time to lock-on (and seems to lose lock-on if put away in pocket or car, or in walking in wooded areas); uses a lot of battery life; and the promoted 1 million landmarks do NOT seem to include many of the areas that I have used in our New England area (such as most town names or landmarks).  I learned to keep it set on the Airplane mode (GPS turns off when camera is turned off) to conserve battery life.  The GPS may be more useful when on vacation in larger cities with major landmarks.As noted in many of the on-line technical reviews, the MOS sensor seems to lack the ability to provide detailed clarity even with the high pixel resolution count at 14 Megapix.  When comparing enlarged images to those on other cameras, there appears to be less clarity/sharpness.  This is disappointing, particularly when comparing the 16X optical zoom that gives a picture that may compare with a 12X zoom on other cameras when cropped to the equavalent size.That said, the MOS sensor does allow for very fast processing, and that provides some convenient high burst speed shots that can exceed 10 frams/sec compared to 1.5 - 2.0 fps on CCD cameras.I am still working on using the facial recognition features, but am not very satisfied at results so far.  First the camera has to achieve facial detection, and then perform facial recognition evalution based on my manual picture inputs for individuals I want recognized.  Many pictures are coming out without any faces detected and thus will not support recognition (this may be related to needing closer up shots, and at full frontal positioning).I found the provided Panasonic PhotoFunStudio managing/editing software to be somewhat limited as compared to my existing software (MS Digital Photo) in editing capabilities.  Also, the Panasonic software is needed to get the full benefit of many of the image properties (such as GPS, facial recognition, and camera modes).  While the AVC HD video 1080 format provides small file sizes, I am still working on finding suitable video editing software (currently having problems with Roxio handling any HD settings).  However, both the camera and the PC software allow for fast and efficient cropping of video segments in-camera and on PC (very convenient).Overall, I am pleased with large feature assortment and technical performance for this \"pocket\" camera.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Soft focus = weak picture quality", "Author": "newyork2dallas", "ReviewID": "R11DGO64607N9B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned this for 12 days.

The image stabilization is top notch, and it has consumer level settings change ability.  However, having lost the charger and USB cable now, I have to give it a poor review for three reasons:1.)  The camera cannot be charged via USB or any other charger aside from the proprietary one that ships with the camera.  If you lose the charger, you're S.O.L.  Even if you have the USB cable, it won't charge by connecting it to your PC or an AC-to-DC USB charger.2.)  The USB cable is proprietary.  So if you lose it, you have to jump through hoops to get another, which leads me to my third reason ...3.)  Panasonic has awful customer service.  I ordered a cable from their website and received the wrong one.  That led to me spending an hour on the phone with them to find out that they would not allow me to return the cable without paying shipping plus a restocking fee.  Meanwhile, they quoted me three different prices on the cable I actually needed, ranging from $20-$23, and could not explain to me the difference.  So I ended up ordering the USB cable from dCables here on Amazon.  I spent way less, but it still only works as an interface cable, not a charging cable.Despite the camera's great functionality when it's charged, it's just an expensive paper weight at the moment.  I'll pay the $70ish to get the charger, but that's a lot of money to spend on a $200 camera.  If the camera was simply USB standardized, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.

Ambient light no doubt is what it's meant for but I tried in a basement with all lights on and it was a joke. And yes, it is a bright room. For stills I guess it's okay from what I tried but this isn't worth it.Also, the video file format is not one you want if you archive on DVD. One format is the apple quick time (.mov) which needs converting definitely. And the software only converts to non-HD Mpeg2 which is dumb. I want to convert in HD, not Mpeg2 480p. The other format at 60fps is M2TS which has incredible large files. It's nice to get uncompressed files but I'm not doing professional work and want some compression.I highly recommend SAMSUNG which is a great all around point and shoot. We don't hear about it much but the MP4 files for the HD video are just right. And the included software for SAMSUNG is way better than Panasonic.Also for the Lumix, the battery can ONLY be charged while outside the camera in a recharger.

I took some photos in a place and then, I got indoor in other place it stills keep the old GPS position. I expected at least that in photos it showed position unknown.I had one previous model of Panasonic (I don't remember the specific model) but this one is thinner and lighter. The HD video quality, in my opinion, is very good comparing to other models (even camcorders) I tested. A great feature is the video button, which allows you to gather videos in any photo scenarios. It also allows Zooming during capture, what is obvious but the feature was not present in the previous model.At first sight the battery seemed insufficient. I bought another battery pack, just in case. Thus, if you use too many video and the GPS it will naturally drain more battery.Anyway, it is a great camera and if you like Lumix you might like this one.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Boom!", "Author": "Green Valley, AZ", "ReviewID": "R1C1V5V76ME52N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT Camera.

I have been bird watching for about 3 weeks now, and I have found it to be very relaxing. I have been able to photograph many birds, and the camera is so good I am able to capture the expression of each bird. Some birds try to be serious, some try to look curious, others are shy, and others try to be mysterious, however one thing they all do is fly away after the camera flashes.I am very happy that this camera has brought me closer to nature and wildlife. I really enjoy the outdoors, and enjoy long walks near ponds and lakes, where birds are.

Godfrey \"Cswerve\"", "ReviewID": "R1LCNZ6VO1TLO9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I must admit that I don't have the DMC-ZS10, but I would caution anyone against buying it and here's why.  In 2010 two friends and myself each bought the DMC-ZS7. Its basically the same camera as this one (same aesthetics).  At the time it was listed as the best camera in its class by Cnet.  Two of us got ours from Amazon, a third friend bought his from a different vendor.  We all initially thought our camera's were great.  We loved all the features; high speed burst, gps, great zoom, etc. But there were problems right out the box, chiefly the poor quality indoor pics.  Looking at the reviews here I see Panasonic hasn't fixed that problem yet, however that wasn't the only problem.Over the next few months one of my friends began to notice lint inside the camera behind the lens.  What made him aware of it, was the fact that he was taking pictures of something in the (blue)sky and noticed blemishes on his photos.  Upon closer inspection, he noticed the lint.  He sent his camera in, because it was under warranty and they gave him a refurbished model.  A couple months later, same thing, so he sent it in again; again, another refurbished model.  3 months after the warranty was up, he got the lint again.  He's a heavy camera user, but used his camera case religiously (of all of us, I was the one who was most likely to to stick my camera in my pocket without the case, but when at home, I kept it in the case). At the time the rest of us weren't seeing this problem and thought he got a defective camera(s).  He did some internet research and saw a forum where others were having this issue.About six months ago, I began having the same issue with my camera, of course the warranty was up by then so I had no recourse.  Its annoying to know that I can't take pictures of anything with a light background without seeing these blemishes on my pictures.  Looking in the lens, I can see the lint.  How did it get in there?  Isn't that supposed to be airtight?Our third friend now has lint, but he's not concerned enough about it to worry, he says he uses his camera very little and being an avid gardener only uses it for taking pictures of his garden in the summer.Head over to youtube.  There are videos on how to open the camera to clean the sensor, because that can help with \"some\" of the blemishes, but wont fix the ones in the \"airtight\" compartment immediately behind the lens.We each paid almost 300 dollars for our cameras and what a waist of money.  I've had better luck with my 99 dollar walmart camera.  This was my first major camera purchase and Panasonic really let me down.As of this note our first friend has bought a new camera, several months ago (Canon) and today I broke down and bought a new one myself (Sony).
