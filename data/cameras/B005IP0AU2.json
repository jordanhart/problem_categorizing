I am hoping to make photography a part time career and I am in love with this camera! I love the lenses it came with and the other accessories. The only thing is the back pack is ok. One side of the zipper already broke so I have to use the other zipper to zip the whole bag and it fits my stuff but not that neatly. I need a bigger bag, so I ordered another bag that can fit everything, its a great starter bag in my opinion, but I think a little bit of a bigger bag would be worth it in the future to put in this bundle.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon 60D", "Author": "Fred J.
