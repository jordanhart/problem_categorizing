{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Dream Camera For Me!", "Author": "Dr. Johnson C. Philip \"Author of over 100 boo...", "ReviewID": "R36QDR40CRD7E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a compulsive photographer, and started shooting people and objects when I was 15. A friend presented me with my first digital camera when I was 45, and life has never been the same again. That was Sony Mavica, and it used 3.5 inch floppy disks to store pictures. The highest resolution was only 1.2 mega pixels, but with its 16x optical magnification it did wonders for me.This is my fourth digital Camera in 15 years. In fact the moment I read the specification and the Sony name, I sold my non Sonly Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera, removable lens, and telephoto lens (puchased for a futune) at a loss and bought this model. Once again, life has never been the same again after I bought it.Here are some of the features*** It offer 20+ Mega-pixel resolution, something that can do wonders*** It offer and unbelievable 50x OPTICAL magnification, again something that can do wondersCare to Take:*** The camera offers so much in terms of resolution and optical magnification that most users need to learn afresh that a powerful tool can be used in unbelievable way. Do explore all the possibilities*** Do use a monopod or a tripod for shooting at magnifications greater than 20xUniqueness:*** High resolution*** Super-high magnification*** Ability to keep the flash off in any and every situation (a manual switch is provided)*** All other standard software features are available*** Very light and ergonomic designMost Helpful Feature:*** The ability to shoot pictures even in relative darkness is the feature most helpful to me. This means that I do not have to turn the flash on at most occasions. What is more, if the image on the viewfinder screen looks dark, the circular switch at the back of the camera allows you to lighten the image before shooting to an amazing degree. This means that one can save considerable amount of battery charge, which in turn gives a longer battery life. This feature also produces better pictures than dark pictures made light in a graphics program.Recommendation:*** If ease of use, high resolution, and high optical magnification is your need, then this is THE camera for you*** It is very economically pricedI have been using this Camera now for 3 months and for me it is dream come true.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review from a skeptical guy", "Author": "Adnan V.P.", "ReviewID": "R27QLJ232SN0NI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Normally, I see these \"bundle\" packs as a waste of time. Usually you end up paying extra for a bunch of cheap \"off-brand\" items that you wouldn't think to buy if you really thought about it. But... the price of this camera bundle is the EXACT same price Amazon sells it for the camera alone. I'm not going to lie, there are still some random pieces in this bundle that will be tucked away in a drawer and never see the light of day, but the following items alone are worth it:- BRAND new Sony Camera- BRAND new Sony Case (not an off-brand or cheap one)- BRAND new SONY 16GB memory card (keep in mind the camera does not come with one)- BRAND new lens cap cord (again, camera doesn't come with one)There are a bunch of other little items in the bundle that have worth, but I believe I've made my point.

I'm a mom of two kids, two dogs, a cat and a busy schedule. I don't have time to tinker and click 100 things to figure out how to get the right settings for the picture I want to take.  I still have much to figure out but in the short time I've had it, I'm in love!Now...the items in the bundle??  I paid about $20 more than I would have for the camera and got a TON of things...the SD card alone (16MB) would run over $10. The case is genuine Sony and sturdy.  The tripod is perfect for those times where you need to grab a shot with the self-timer.

We went to Mt. Hood yesterday and it took great pictures of the mountain and ice in the river..Still will be learning this every day.ConsThe lens cap string is cheap and the glued part keeps coming off, my hubby is going to fix this. Sony needs to come up with a better and stronger solution for future sales.Was not clear on how to download pictures before we left for the trip, in the manual (not sufficient enough) talks about Play Memories website which I did download and then found upon our return the card reader/writer= so I used this and downloaded all the pictures- it works great- but all the previous cameras I have owned it comes with software and when you plug in it asks if you want to download- I like this way better instead of having to take the card out each timeProsLove Love Love this camera and have no regrets. I do find 30 on zoom to be blurry but have not used the tripod yet. I am going to order a extra battery for this.  I shot 220 photos and 4 videos yesterday and the battery only showed down one bar. Pleased with that.I am an amateur and if you want a point and click with a lot of options to shoot different objects this is for you.

I have it all assembled and it is charging.  I think I have pretty much figured out how everything works and look forward to using the effects inherent in the camera.  Somehow, it escaped me that the tripod was only a 9 inch tripod, so I have to order a good tripod for use with this camera.  The bag does not hold the camera and all the accessories, but it does hold all the accessories, and my older smaller camera will also fit into it, so I will always have them both with me.  The professional dust blower has a disagreeable odor and I have put it in a plastic zipper bag so I don't have to smell it.  The one thing I REALLY do not like is the way the lens cap attaches to the camera.  For the cost of this camera there should be a more professional way of attaching the cap. Perhaps in time, I will come to see the logic for the way it is. I did read many reviews before I bought, so I look forward to being generally pleased with this camera.

We had fun playing with the different settings and taking pictures. I would totally recommend this camera to anyone who loves to shoot photographs.

Not sure how to upload photos or video but if you get to our site, you will see examples of the quality photos AND video you can take with this camera.Hands down, the best camera I have ever owned,,, period!  It is rare that I am this pleased with a product.How amazing?  Okay, check this out. I went outside one night and standing on my deck, holding the camera with only my hands I did a 50x zoom on the moon. FIRST, the amazing thing was that I was actually able to hold and keep the moon in the picture with my bare hands. Second, the pictures I got were mind blowing. I could actually see, crystal clear I might add, the crater shadows on the moon and the moon was the full size of the photo. Simply amazing. On a more practical note, the battery is amazing. I have done hours of shoots and never once ran out of juice. One problem,, my family keeps snatching up to play with :). The included 16 gig card is a real bonus and all the other accessories are just icing on the cake.

Popek", "ReviewID": "R78YY4M32ECUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok all the amazing things this does are covered in the specifications and the splash marketing page. But it only scratches the surface! Let's start with the lens system and filed of viewing and picture taking, this camera at low,zoom is a Greta pick up and shoot just like every camera. And that's where the simiaRitzy to everyother camera on the market ends!  It has burst mode ten shot full soliton pictures at o.1 seconds between frames so you can dissect a timed event like a race ending into ten super high resolution images. This was not possible before this. This is ten times faster and way more resolution that HDTV cameras costing thousands.Sticking with the lens it goes from macro , close without do galt, actual,optical lens to 1/2 inch that is not available in the old dslr with the most expensive macro lens they were limited to 2 cm , about and inch the spec say 1 cm about 1/2 an inch inside the flower with  the most pixels in the raw picture!  OK so,regular lens design for six to,theity feet , limited by the flash at thirty mostly and the ratio has to do,with the minute details of a lens. , now you can optical zoom out to a 22 from standard 150 lens , and that is a zoom that is better than most handheld sighting scopes binoculars and mid end telescopes! Now if you keep selecting past optical zoom it seem less ly switches and display in huge LCD display or pure purist through the eye piece the optical,fifty and it multiplies up to,20 or 22 depending on which model, that's  1000:1 telescope ce to 1/2 macro same Carl Zoe's, best optics for over 125 years, the hard part of lens is making them cover this large of a field of view and the colors don't focus at the same point due to minute change in wave length from red to blue, that what makes a great lens it's call chromatic distortion whe looking at specs , there is nothing at all like this.Let talk,about other interesting mode, beside the ten frame burst, this camera take full HDTV and stereo with Dolby encoding! This is found in 10 K and up commercial HDTV video cameras. Now here's an amazing feature while your shooting a movie, you can decide that a picture would be great but you want to keep,taking video just push button and in between frames of video,a full resolution , higher than HDTV , 1080 p, is taken. No,camera does that Sony patented many od these features so you won't get this inany other.More feature for group,picture,or facial portraits it has smile and blink detection built in to autofocus it ha facial,recognition and it take two pictures back to back and wil,take another whe inside and it likes that smile better than the first two. It like having a director. Human inside they body... Now you can turn off full auto go to,part auto, and play with say depth of field,by controlling exposure by one stop one and ahF stop to two stops. For photographers  and the rest it changes the way the background looks compared to the main focal,point. It also can add or lower ..blur which if done right adds a speedy look instead of freezing the person. Most photog swill,shoot auto, and a few with different exposures. For you folks that like to take pictures of meteor showers it will hold the exposure as long as four seconds, and as short as less than 1/1289 of a second. Truely an amazing rangeNow let's talk about lighting this used to be the hardstart of film photography and was a serious limit with early video planes, then CCDs cameras, this is state of the art CMOS meaning each pixel is addressed individually instead of reading ou a row or column , you can imagine that there is some distortion if you take a row of say 100 K pixel , across each other, this is called line leakage, you won't see this spec,or,effect since this Sony uses there r ex or ,patented CMOS sensor. So,what's it mean to users. I took a picture at sunset , from a pon 1/4 mile away of my house with a little zoom to fill frame no light , too far anyway, and the picture looks just like taken at high noon, next picture I zoomed all the way in and focused by hand, I shoot guns so I,can hold my breath and shoot, anyway the sit and house number takes up about two by two,feet at almost full,zoom but not  all,they way just to fill the frame I can read. The sign clearly and the house number. Binocular could not resolve this delatil,at that distance. So it ake picture with very little,light and it processes it to be color corrected that the white sign and black letter against reddish town brick are absolutely spot onNow there are features to take a regular picture and add effects that you used to use a program,like,adobe or many other to do,these fun effects, Apia, cartoon, and others I,have to learna about I,think,this camera is a unit you can grow into,and learn over a few months of shooting a few days ata time, the see results, add  and read a few new features and then see what those do, until you maste all,the effects, There more, the bundle allows for more memory extra memory high end battery spare battery and three differnt charger, read the specs but this is great, it all,comes Ina right sized camera bag not to big not too,small but requires packaging  . Once you register you get SONYS pm photo manger, some packages come witha basic photo re touching program , these mostly do,the same if your serious and want to phony photos  photoshop,is the tool, bit a good,photoshop,operator,take many hours to be average, and a year to be magazine ready. But the camera picture are good enough right out,of the hdmi for typical userOk killer app it takes 3 d photos and video using Sony active 3 d probably everybody's active 3 d , the specs have the standard. That s just amazing .The manual is good and Sony has a downloadable book 100 pages to go into camera and photography details!  They help,you be better with all camera but show you typical phot tools and how to activate on this a era.Ergonomic, the button are I the right place, there is built in hel incase you,need a memory jog, there are so,any extra you need to grow I to this it's the last camera you will need for... At least decade it will,take that long for,the other today this , by then Sony will revolutionize the camera again. I love this camera, everybody Iknow more camera and tech savy love this camera and they can pick it up,and shoot,and play withhotot,since the controls,are the same as Sony, cannon, Panasonic Lu,infix as some of these companies have been combined and ergonomic whe right stay for decades. This is a point and shoot , a videographers dream and a telescope,with amazing focal plane  you can see inside a airplane window above you 5000 feet,a mile easy. Can't wait to get full moon and get out of city lights ... Next,store shower, next rainbow, got almond tree flowering, when California burns the sunsets are like as tire I,can capture them now, at sunrise the sun bending around our,mountian provide a light show that,sat about 30 seconds, this will catch thatIn Hawaii the elusive green flash I've sen it once it last a blink , this would catch it if you were there the moment the sun goes to,the water line and very clear air.Oh it takes panoramas within the camera instead of now where you,take say six picture,and some program stiches,them tighter, nt,anymore, hit,pandora mr turn out,to,330 degrees and it produces a sigle panaoram no,extra steps.
