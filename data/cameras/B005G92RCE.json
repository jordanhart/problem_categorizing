{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A mediocre security DVR", "Author": "ciera_87", "ReviewID": "R2MDH659J5A5SP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Unlike many other security DVR's, this model can record both audio and video - a must-have feature to me.Pros:1. Very inexpensive 4-CH A/V model including a built-in 500GB hard disk.2. Sound recording quality is quite good. Better than many other more expensive models on the market.Cons:1. The spec listed the Highest display setting as:* High Resolution VGA output in 1600x1200 ResolutionActual highest setting allowed is 1280x1024. Poor preview if you put four channels on one screen.2. Mediocre video image quality even at D1 resolution:I tried two CCTV cameras and can not even get the image sync up. Finally, I got it work with my Panasonic camcorder. This model seems require 1.2V P-P/75ohm signal instead of the standard CCTV 1.0V P-P/75ohm video out. All image appears wash out. The image quality seems closely related to the signal level.3. Loud system noise level:The unit ran very quiet when first power up. After the unit warm up, it started emitting loud noise. The sound appear to coming out of the hard disk but I can't be sure.4. Poor manual documentation & support(no support phone#):a. No instruction on email setupb. IE setup instruction does not work. I can only get Firefox to work.c. Poor network setup instruction. I managed to get it work within local network. But can not get portforward to work. A local net DVR is useless to me. Never got far enough to try iPhone app.d. Alarm-in/out stated as unsupported feature. Don't they know this is a security product? You can't connect to your home alarm if someone cut your video camera wire???5. Sound playback over network breaks up:I played back the same .avi file locally and found no problem. The problem appears to related Ethernet loss of packets (slow network hardware.)In conclusion, this model could be a good choice to someone only do local DVR. Recommend buying unit bundled with cameras since this model seems only work with certain cameras. Loud system noise level is a deal breaker. Not sure this problem is just specific to my unit only.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "pugz", "ReviewID": "RWBLI3AD7NGU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This DVR is relatively easy to set up. The internet part is mind boggling though. I even loaded the software on my Blackberry and I can only view my cameras on my phone if I use my wi-fi, regardless of how I set it up. A little pointless.

I've worked to set the motion sensor so it doesn't record leaves moving.  I also setup the machine through the home router so I can view the videos and live shots through a laptop.  That feature is a must and makes it very convenient.  Just plug it into the router and access the IP address of the DVR device.I'm semi computer savy but the machine was very easy to hook up.  The display when viewing from the DVR is primitive but when you use Chrome/IE/etc it's very user friendly and visually appealing.This is my first surveillance DVR so I don't have anything to compare it to, but, for the price, I'm happy.  In this age of buying so much online, unfortunately, it may come in handy some time if someone decides to steal stuff off the patio...Update:  Hooked up the email alerts and was pleasantly surprised.  It sends a photo of the movement (if you have it setup for motion sense).  Pretty cool.

It was connected to four cameras and placed into operation within a few days after it arrived.  There were few issues in configuring it as it is configured much like other DVR systems - no surprises there.There are a few problems, however.  The first is that it would not send email through a local server but only through Gmail.  It might work with other outside services as well, but the previous DVR worked fine with the internal servers.  With the email notification working another problem surfaced: it sends email all the time, regardless of the schedule.The software for PC and iPhone/iPad devices works and seems very similar to that used by other DVRs.  I suspect they are all written by the same guy, that is how identical they are.  I haven't tried the Mac software but it probably works as well.  For web access Internet Explorer is the only supported browser - ActiveX is used so you can't use anything else.One issue with the hardware: the camera connections are too close together making it very difficult to connect the cameras.  Fortunately, this is something that is rarely done, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.There are other systems with much better email notification out there, so I suggest you keep looking if that is important to you.  If it is not, this system should work for you.UPDATE: After using the system for a bit longer and interacting with the support services, I am returning the unit as being unsuitable.  No, the email notifications do not work at all properly.
