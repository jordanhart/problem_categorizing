The zoom/focus is a joke and even at its best resolution it is not that great. Stay with a 600tvl if you need to make out who is in front of the camera. The color shows browns as a baby blue and gets worse from there.Enough said about this product.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great clarity!", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "RS7E1HND15NKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great camera and I've been using it for sometime now at the front of my house.  The only thing I would say to would be purchasers is consider the area in front of the camera you wish to place this.  The IR lights are sooo bright there is actually a halo at night visible in a clear circle.  So it lights up the bushes as bright white approximately ten feet in front of it.  Best to use this camera where objects will not get close to it at all as it will wash out with no detail at night due to this.  When I get around to buying another camera I'm going to replace this one with one that has less IR's and move this to the back yard.All in all I would recommend this, just consider the area you will use it in as there is no way to dial down the power of this light.  They aren't joking when they say out to 50 feet at night as you can clearly see how powerful they are in situations less than that.  I considered creating a light diffuser to go over the IR's but just haven't gotten around to it.  So I could correct the issue I have but it would be far nicer if you could control the power of these IR's to begin with.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$319.95", "Features": "Powered by 1/3 Sony Super HAD CCD technology, color DSP, automatic CDS sensor\n540 TV lines high resolution, built-in 3.5-8mm manual zoom focus lens\nBuilt-in 36 Infrared lights for night vision\n1/50~1/12,000 second Electronic Shutter, 0.45 Gamma Correction\nPower requires:12V DC 500mA (sold separately)", "Name": "VideoSecu Day Night Built-in 1/3\" Sony CCD IR Outdoor Dome Security Camera 540TVL Vandal Proof 3.5-8mm Zoom Focus Lens for CCTV Home Surveillance DVR System with bonus Security Warning Decal VD49HW 1ZA", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51guQzccyDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0041R8I98"}}
