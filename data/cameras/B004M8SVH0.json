Rosenow", "ReviewID": "R3RTRLUOXLGVSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For anyone looking at getting a decent, mid-level point-and-shoot with the look and feel of an SLR, the Nikon Coolpix L120 is by far the best choice, even with its few shortcomings!As a semi-professional photographer who primarily shoots film (but is slowly converting to digital) I always have kept at least a digital P&S; camera with me to get those \"quick\" shots that I can't get because of the time involved in setting up the shot in an SLR. My previous camera, the Minolta DiMAGE S414 had been getting long in the tooth and was starting to glitch. A friend gave me his Nikon Coolpix E5200 and I was immediately hooked on Nikon's legendary imaging quality. However, the 5-megapixel sensor in the Coolpix E5200 was short of what I truly needed, so the same friend who gave me the E5200 also let me try out his Coolpix L110. I was blown away with how well the photos turned out! In my quest to buy my own Coolpix L110, I had heard back in February that Nikon was releasing the Coolpix L120, with a 2-megapixel increase over the L110 and several new features. Having read the first reviews of the camera, it seemed like a sure winner, so I took the plunge on March 14th of this year and secured one for myself.Instantly, I was hooked on it. Right out of the box, this camera is a winner! The settings, user-interface, the sleek design and the nifty zoom selector on the lens barrel makes this camera worth every penny. In the short time I have owned it, I have already taken approximately 1,200 photos with it; everything from nature, bridges, even the sun! (with a solar filter, of course). And with its fantastic 21x optical zoom, I can photograph a car at more than a quarter-mile away and be able to clearly read its license plate!The only drawback I can see is that Nikon has left out the ability to manually control your aperture and shutter speed settings (instead, leaving that for the Nikon Coolpix P500 which I was unimpressed with). However, those small shortcomings are overwhelmed by the simplicity this camera offers. Itching to get into Panorama photography, without the need for an expensive SLR with built-in panorama stitching? Consider it done! With this camera's Panorama-Assist feature (which overlays a small portion of the image onto the screen for the next shot to be composed), and the supplied Arcsoft Panorama Maker Pro 5 software, Panorama-style photography has never been more affordable. Looking to enhance photos with HDR-like color clarity? Consider that done, also! This camera supplies with it built-in D-Lighting that preserves the color intensity of an image yet bringing out the details otherwise hidden within dark shadows. Also supplied, incase you don't want to edit your images in-camera, is Nikon's own View NX-2, which not only includes D-lighting enhancement filters, it also offers a host of other image-editing capabilities!In short, this camera has the competition beat! I would recommend it (I have the black version) over anything else.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A solid performer with some minor quirks", "Author": "A. Oertel \"Wood Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1L61WR60KQVF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nikon L120 about a month ago in preparation for a trip we were taking to California.  Although I was impressed by several of the features I read about, such as the extended zoom and pseudo-dslr design, I still had some concerns about a couple of features such as the complaints about focusing and lack of manual controls.  After shooting about 200 pictures, I am happy to report that I will be keeping the camera.I'll address my concerns about the reported concerns others expressed.  First was the concern over focus.  At one point, the camera was having trouble focusing on a shot of the sea and horizon.  Everything was blurry and only items within 20-30 ft. would be in focus.  I tried several different modes, including landscape and beach, but it did not cure the problem.  At that point, I decided to just turn it off and turn it back on and that solved the problem.  There must be some issue with the algorithms which pick certain items to focus, but the old \"off and on\" trick fixed it and I had no other problems, even under similar circumstances.  The other issue was of the lack of manual modes. Except for the focus issue, I had no problems with exposure under any conditions, inside, outside, bright lights, dim, flash, portraits, etc.Now onto the good things.  Battery life is very good.  I took over 200 pictures  with regular alkaline batteries. Although I had lithium batteries ready to go, it has not been necessary to use them.  With battery life that good and the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries, I don't think I\"ll go to the expense of lithium batteries.I really like the form factor of the camera.  The bulge on the right side is very handy and you can hold it securely with only a couple of fingers.  Taking the lense cap on and off is annoying, especially when you forget to take it off after  you power it up.  However, it's no more annoying than it was in the old days of analog cameras.  Also with the plain old lense cap, there are no concerns with sand jamming up exterior shutters.  The camera is too large to fit in your shirt pocket but not too big to fit in a coat pocket or purse/backpack.  I think it's an acceptable compromise on size.  Zoom is excellent.  Seals which were several hundred yards away looked like we were right on top of them.  I did not experience any shutter lag, although I have not used the camera in burst or sports mode yet.  Video mode is about what  you would expect for a hand held camera.  OK, not great, but works well enough for that quick video when you need more than a still camera.To sum it up, I like the battery life, picture quality, good assortment of modes, adequate flash range and fantastic zoom.  The camera definitely has a few quirks but ones I decided I can live with.  I give it a solid  9 out of 10.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loved it - but returned it", "Author": "Keith in Dallas \"K\"", "ReviewID": "R1XU0BZU1HRIO4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera and loved the ease of operation and picture quality. I also have the Panasonic DMC-FZ35, which is VERY complicated. I needed something simpler. I learned to use this Nikon after only 1 hour of reading the manual (compared to months still trying to figure out the Panasonic). Was easy getting great pictures. Smile detection and Pet mode worked terrific. Unfortunately, my primary reason for this type of hybrid camera, is for the convenience of camera and HD video in one unit. Video quality on this unit is well below average. I compared it to my Panasonic - no comparison. The Panasonic's video was smooth and clear, the Nikon - grainy and jerky. I really wanted to keep this camera for it's ease of use and picture quality, but the poor video quality ultimately caused me to return it. Until I find an easy to use camera with good picture and video, I'll continue with the months of trying to figure out the Panasonic.PROS: Ease of use, great pictures, smile detection, pet mode, easy to understand manual, price.CONS: Poor video quality", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally a digital designed like a 35mm", "Author": "Jgoyle \"Jgoyle\"", "ReviewID": "R2I4EEEKDTSJZ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved this camera just a couple of days ago. Wow what a fantastic surprise! My two previous digital cameras were a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ10 which I purchased in 2009 for a bicycle tour. While the camera had a lot of good things going for it a couple of problems stuck out which I could not tolerate. 1st and foremost it was very poor in bad lighting and the flash did not compinsate. 2nd..it really needed to be held steady any movement created a blurry picture. Declining light only made the issue worse. My other digital is a Nikon Coolpix 4300 which I bought 6 or 7 years ago to handle an online website. I love that camera, great pictures. good in bad light, not much zoom capability but could deal with that. The big problem...It was designed with an odd memory card which is hard to get and did not hold as much as comparable cameras today. I still use this camera for my website.Good luck with Nikon and poor luck with Lumix I decided to chance another Nikon. Wow again..quick focus, Holds a common SD card, great zoom capabilities, and best of all it opperates very well in poor light conditions, in fact I forced a poor light condition under my desk with no flash and worked beyond belief!

After reading the comments on it's predecessor the Nikon L100 and L110, I did two things immediately.

I'm having fun experimenting with the different settings in the menu and recently took some very interesting night shots on my street. Macro is stunning.  I found some great cases at Target and Walmart, but the one I bought fits so nicely is a small Lowenpro, it was under $20 with room enough for the camera with strap, and a little pouch for an extra set of batteries.

All I can say is wow. First of all the battery life for me was great. I was not to keen on the 4 AA batteries that were required to be used because i never had good luck with that type of camera. My first set of batteries that I used took over 600 photos and that is using the flash most of the time. The zooming on this is great. Now when there is a really far zoom, don't expect it to be top notch photo but the anti-shacking option on this camera helps with the far photo shots. I have a 16 gig SD card in mine and with the max mp turned on to 14.1 i am able to get over 4,000 photos on one card. Now the photos, it really does a good job for a point and shoot camera. It does take some time to learn the camera but there are two settings that make it much easier to use. One is the easy mode, and the other is the Auto mode. Both are good for starters or just to get a good couple quick shots off. Attached are a few photos I have taken with this camera in all different light conditions.

I owned a D200 with an assortment of lens and I now own the D90 with various lens.  I was looking for a high quality PnS camera for my wife and after reading the many many reviews I settled on this one.  I am going to write this review now after testing it for a day and I will do like some others and continue to add updates periodically if anything noteworthy comes up.  Now for the details.  If you are looking for a PnS camera with P,S,A,M controls (aperture, shutter speed, etc) then this camera is NOT for you.  This camera is for one group, the folks that want to turn it on, push the button and get a good photo (my wife is in this group!).  There is absolutely nothing to learn about the camera.  You put in the 4 batteries, the memory card, and turn the power on.  Even the most photo ignorant person could figure out the functionality without ever consulting an instruction manual.  The \"scene selection\" button will bring up a menu of 4 main categories.  1. Easy Auto Mode (for those who only want to know the power button and shutter button), 2. A large assortment of scenes (portrait, landscape, Sunset, closeup, and many more), 3. Continuous SPORT mode (I was VERY impressed with this mode), 4. Auto mode (with the ability to change the normal PnS stuff like white balance, ISO, flash, and a few others).The setting I had to try first was the Sport Continuous mode.  I was VERY impressed with this mode.  Does it equal my D90 shooting with my 2.8 70-200? no, but the quality is VERY good for a PnS camera.  We have the Canon SD700, SD750 and SD800 and none of these would even come close to capturing what the L120 did.  To compare image quality I used the L120 and my D90 with a Sigma 18-200 OS.  I shot the flowers on a tripod.  I shot the little girl handheld.  I tried to frame the same shot at the same distance with both cameras.  This is not a lab test so it is not perfect.  I simply wanted to compare the $900 SLR with a $400 lens to the $275 PnS.  The quality of the L120 was pretty amazing.  I am going to post the images of both cameras in the product images above so you can see them.The initial cons I found are: I don't like the SD card and batteries being in the same compartment.  The battery door is not very easy to open and close.  I also found a few of the buttons a little easy to accidentally push until I get the camera situated in my hand.  It is however, very comfortable to hold.I have not even tried the video and all the various scene selections.  I just began snapping pictures and then looked at them in photoshop compared to my D90 photos.  I did not have to do alot of testing to see that I was very pleased.  I will post more as we use it and I have informative info to add.  I can say ditto to the many many positive ratings for this camera.UPDATE 05/22/11 : I am finding the still the photos to still be outstanding.  However, the sport photos have been somewhat of a challenge.  In the scene selection you can only choose \"Sport Continuous\".  The part I don't like is that while you hold the button down it will take multiple photos.  Then when the shutter button is released, it will complete the \"write to card\" process (I have ordered a class 10 card to see if that speeds up the write process).  In a normal DSLR camera, you would continue to track the person you are photographing and keep shooting if a shot is there.  The L120 is used to capture a 3-5 second span and then it will write to the card.  While it is writing to the card, you will NOT see anything on the LCD and therefore you would have lost the subject.  When using my D90, I would continue to track the person I am photographing and continue to shoot.  That is just not feasible with the L120 (i.e. track, or any sport where they are running in a somewhat straight line).  You just simply capture a 3-5 second time frame and have multiple shots of that moment in time.  The picture quality is not as good when trying to pan the camera and capture a moving target.  When I am so used to being able to make all my changes manually, it is somewhat hard for me to use this camera and have no control other than selecting the appropriate scene from the menu.  As I stated in my original review, this camera is designed for the aperture ignorant use who simply wants to turn on the camera and take a picture.  At my kids' field day, I found out after importing the images that they were all shot in 640 pixels!!!  I have no idea how she (my wife) changed that but she or someone did.  That rendered the photos useless for print.  I fixed it but it was too late.  This was only for the \"Sport Continuous\" mode that I had the resolution problem.  When she had \"auto\" or \"portrait\" mode selected, the image size was normal.  There is a setting in the \"Sport Continuous\" mode that allows you to change the image resolution for just that mode and anything less than the largest size is going to be too small to print anything decent.UPDATE 05/25/11: I am very sorry to say that I am growing increasingly unhappy with this camera.  I mostly take outside pictures and in good light it has done really well, especially landscape pictures.  However in low light I finding that it really stinks.  A REALLY major problem is that the flash will NOT auto popup if needed (even if you have it set to \"auto\").  The flash must be raised manually and then it will fire if you have it set correctly.  Most of my initial images were in my normal outdoor setting.  But once we began to use the camera indoors at the recent end of the year school functions, it has been a big disappointment.  I guess the real question is this.  Is there any PnS camera out there that will perform well in relatively low to medium light situations.  I am really considering calling Adorama and seeing if this can't be exchanged for something else.  I have already mentioned that I don't like the door for the battery and SD card.  I hate it even more.  It is very hard to open and close.  Finding out that it goes thru batteries fairly quickly too.

The Coolpix L120 had some great specs and reviews, so we decided to try it.  We've also have an older Canon Powershot A720is point and shoot camera that we've really liked, but it was starting to not capture all of the shots in focus (seems to be a common problem with digital point and shoots as they get older).We really wanted to like the camera - it's comfortable to hold and seems to have all the features we needed.  However, our immediate impression was that so many of our shots of the kids were blurred by their motion.  It seems to work very well for still images, and as I look back over the previously posted pictures, most of the shots are still ones.  If there is any movement (and with kids from 18 months to 7 years, there always is), there is going to be some blur.  You don't have any sort of manual control over the shutter speed with this camera, so we were unable to correct for it through any of the modes.  There is a sports mode that will shoot many shots consecutively, but the resolution is cut down significantly to about 3Megapixels.I looked back over the reviews and found someone else who had a similar experience with the camera.  They had recommended a different Nikon point and shoot the Coolpix S8100 that seems to have worked well.  We returned this one and purchased a Nikon Coolpix P300.  It gives you a little more control as compared to the Coolpix s8100 with a metal case and a very fast lens (f/1.8).  The fast lens means that it can choose a faster shutter speed to capture kids before they move.  It also has a sports continuous mode that will shoot full resolution shots at a very high speed.The pictures with the P300 are night and day as compared to the L120.  No more motion blur, and it is very responsive (not as fast as a digital SLR, but still good).  The zoom range is much more limited than the L120, but most of our shots are of reasonable distances from the kids at home, outside, or at a party.  For this, the camera is excellent.  We didn't really buy the P300 for the video, but it works well and looks good.In hindsight, we should have paid more attention to the speed of the lens.  The Canon point and shoot we have is a f/2.8 lens (which is very good/fast) and the P300 has a f/1.8 lens (which is even better for low light/action photography).  I think the L120 with a f/3.1 lens should work well, but it seems that the metering consistently selects a longer shutter time (even with the flash) and we just haven't been able to get good pictures unless the subject is completely still.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific camera for the $", "Author": "Trinity \"justanoldman\"", "ReviewID": "R3884PSQE376D9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old Nikon was 2003 vintage Coolpix 885 and great back then but the menu had died in it soconsidering trying to get it fixed vs getting a new camera, I shopped around.I'm glad I did.

It does however come with a tiny cord to attach it to the camera which was cool! No more setting it down and then looking for it. You need to be careful installing the batteries properly. I ought a couple of the Transcend 16 gb memory cards through Amazon. Walmart had a 4 pack of their Lithium best AA batteries so I bought and used them.

I did.The menu is now intuitive and easy to maneuver compared to my Nikon Coolpix 885.I really do need to read the book though since this camera has outstanding features. The picture quality, I can't believe how good it is.The larger screen is really really nice. The software I had already tried with my older camera. I love it.

A very nice and easy-to-use camera for beginners (and birders)", "Author": "N. Andersen", "ReviewID": "R31KPJC0BJ2E0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had a few different compact cameras - mostly Nikon Coolpix compacts - and have loved the simplicity of a camera that reliably takes good pictures without a lot of fuss.  I've got cameras with more manual controls, but for most ordinary situations where we take photos with the family or outdoors on a walk the ease of a point-and-shoot compact is preferable.  The problem is that many of these situations require a lot more zoom power than you'd normally get with a compact (but where it's sometimes awkward to lug a big camera with a long lens and a tripod).  Sometimes you just can't get very close, but you still need to get good pictures, and you still want a camera that's convenient enough to carry in a small bag or purse.  School plays, soccer games, swim meets, even birdwatching.  We wanted something that was simple to use, fairly inexpensive, but had a bigger lens with more zooming power than our older Nikon Coolpix.  This meets our needs exactly.  One of the main reasons we bought this was for my wife, a volunteer at a local bird sanctuary on the beach.  She wanted a camera that she could use to shoot bird pictures, that gave her some serious optical zoom (21x!), but that wouldn't be too heavy to lug around.  We went to an elementary school graduation the other day, for example, and with this camera we were able to get closeups of our daughter even from the back of the auditorium.It shoots very good pictures (as in, much better than you can expect from a camera phone, but not nearly as good as you'd expect from a DSLR) and good quality HD video at 720p.  The sound on the video is okay, but not great, so it's best for something you might include in a vacation album or something like that.  I've been quite impressed by its macro capabilities - and by how easy it is to switch into macro mode for extreme close up shots of bugs or flowers and the like.  Pretty much the only manual controls you get here are the zoom and the flash (as in, you can decide whether or not to zoom and whether or not to use the flash).  Beyond that, it's got the adjustments you'd expect from a compact camera.  You can select a scene type and the camera will make some adjustments for you, or you can set the exposure higher or lower than what the camera calculates, and you can select white balance as needed.  We've been quite happy with it.  (One minor irritation: if you turn it on and you've forgotten to remove the lens cap, you have to remove the cap and then turn it back off and then on again.  My Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 - the compact I tend to carry around, that doesn't zoom like this one - lets you just remove the cap and then press any button.)", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprised me and I'm loving it.", "Author": "Tanisha \"a lover of books and finer things\"", "ReviewID": "R2M9A90N4JY0W3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much hemming, hawing and checking out reviews I decided to purchase the Nikon L120 bridge camera.  It's not exactly a point and shoot camera but it's not fully a DSLR either.  It's caught somewhere in-between helping you get comfortable with using features on the DSLR and still have the simplicity of a point and shoot camera.  The surprises came when I started to use it.  I had my heart set on buying a Nikon D90 but those are going for $600+ on Ebay (crazy!).  So that was out of my reach but I had seen this one before at Target and there was a deal at Wal-Mart and I figured let's try it out, worse comes to worse I'd return it.  I'm glad I kept it and this is why.Surprise #1, It runs on regular AA's, 4 to be exact.  You can use rechargeable but it comes with 4 Energizer AA's.Surprise #2, It has an internal memory.  Most digital cameras do not have that.  I found this out when I took pictures of my mother in front of the Christmas tree when she was all dolled up and realized after she got undressed that my SD card was still in my laptop.  I pressed the image preview button on the camera and the images were there.  Strange I thought but I took a chance and plugged it into my laptop and was able to download the images from the camera's internal memory.  Whew, was I happy to have not lost those pictures.Surprise #3, The setting for kids and sports.  I used it on the Macy's animated Christmas window display.  They had things moving and I wanted to capture that and I took the picture of the window and the lens shut and delayed for a second or two.  I figured it was going to be blurry and I moved on without looking at the photo.  Later I looked at the image and saw that the camera had taken 3 separate images of the moving image in the window display and when you put them all together it was the doll moving.  It looked very cool and in focus and I couldn't believe it had done that in that short amount of time.Surprise #4, the focus can be controlled on the lens or on the click button.  It takes getting use to using the one on the lens but it gives my left-hand something to do besides holding the camera.  The focus itself is great.  I know there have been complaints about blurry images but that's the beauty of a digital camera.  You take a blurry image you'll know right away to erase it and take another one.  Haven't had a chance to take images of the full moon or stars but that will be the first order of business in the spring.  I'll really be able to test the focus then.The cons are why I can't rate this a 5-star camera.Con #1: The flash won't come up in auto-focus unless you pull it up.  Annoying.Con #2: Hate the lens cap.  It dangles and gets in the way and I always forget to take it off before I turn on the camera.  I know it protects the lens but it's a nuisance.I've taken photography classes to learn the nuts and bolts of photography.  I've had a Nikon N65 for years and a Canon point and shoot for years.  I came to hate the Canon and it's limitations and there were many.  I loved my Nikon N65 for it's fast shutter speed but it was a film camera and I wasted more film and money on bad shots than I did on good ones.  Plus the price of Nikkor lens were and still are outrageous.  I'm not a professional photographer and I don't want to be one.  I want to take photos of things that interest me, things I want to remember, family, friends, places and moments.  I want to take photos of what I like, period.  And so far, this camera has helped me do that this Christmas better than all the others I've had, including my favorite which is a Fujifilm camera.I've shared some images that I took in New York during 2011 Christmas time visiting the store's window displays.  They were taken with crowds of people all around, pushing and vying for a photo position.  They are not blurry or out of focus and IMHO pretty nice for a self-described \"one-notch above amateur photographer\".  In my opinion, anyone should always do their do diligence and read all the reviews, compare prices and features but give this one a try.  This is a bridge-camera not a DSLR.  It definitely looks like a DSLR but it's not.  It acts like a point and shoot camera but it's not.  Like I said at the beginning it's an in-between camera.  If you don't have some experience with SLR you will get pissed quickly.  If you have too much experience with SLR and looking for a DSLR you will be annoyed and get pissed quickly.  This is just my opinion and experience with Nikon's Coolpix L120 so take it for what it's worth and happy photo taking to all.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Baruch Noam Velvel Dubrow \"WolfBrow\"", "ReviewID": "R15VKDUCDB1SEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over all I think that this is a great camera. I chose this one over the Canon SX 130 and I am still happy with my decision. This camera is for those people that really just want a point and shoot camera without worrying about settings. All the settings are pre-determined and you can choose things like whether you're shooting indoor or outdoor but you cant choose aperture or some of the more specific personalized settings. (if you want that then go for the Canon).One of the reasons I chose this camera was because of the display. It is a big display with crisp clear images that transfer well on a computer screen. (the canons screen was very grainy) also the hd video is amazing. the images come out so vivd and living and full of color.The only things that I have experienced that are a little irksome are 1. battery life during video. while the battery life for pictures is fairly decently long the battery life for taking video (which is one of the main reasons i chose this camera) is rather short. normal double a batteries last approximately 3 hours. this may be different for rechargeable batteries, they may last longer, i haven't tried it yet. so just be warned that if you plan on using it a lot for video taking (not just once in a while, i am talking about using it for video only, throughout the day) then you might want to get rechargeable batteries.2. while taking video when zooming in or out sometimes it will have to auto refocus which fuzzes the video for a second. this could just be me and my so far lack of knowing how to properly zoom. but just know that there is that issue.3. the rapid photo shoot mode isnt the greatest. i tried to take a rapid picture of my friend jumping off a 15 foot diving board and because of the way that rapid shoot was made i dont know when it is actually taking the picture and when its loading. ( a little timeglass comes up and sits on the screen for about 30 seconds).overall i still think it is a great camera and i would highly suggest it to those who want an easy point and shoot camers with great video quality. for those who want it to use for making video (5 minute youtube movies) i would suggest getting rechargeable batteries.for those of you who like to be able to pick your own settings like aperture etc. this isn't the camera for you", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for beginners", "Author": "Ireflyfish", "ReviewID": "R1PSS7445H90HP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is for folks who want point and shoot capability, a good zoom lens, and do not need manual controls. If you want the camera to do all the thinking for you, then this is the right camera for you.The Nikon L120 has only minimal manual adjustment controls. Menu navigation is not very user friendly or intuitive, and the functions are very limited. The self timer only has one setting - 10 seconds. You can adjust exposure compensation and ISO, but that's it. The zoom is jerky and I missed a few great shots of wildlife because the image stabilization software kept making image captures, which are supposed to help (not!) instead of showing the actual view. Test drive it in the store and you will see what I mean. I recommend turning the image stabilization off, and using A tripod for long zooming. There is no manual override for fill flash.On the plus side this camera is compact and stylish, and the continuous mode is fast. The smile mode worked great, but I had a hard time getting the pet mode to recognize my pet and snap the picture automatically, even when my cat or dog were looking directly at the camera. The pet must be perfectly still for a full two seconds or so to get the face frame to appear. Pets don't stay still for long!

Surprisingly it did not. I was attracted, as I'm sure a lot of people are, by the DSLR look, the impressive zoom capability, and color. Smile detection as well as other features caught my eye, of course. But to start off, the zoom very much failed to live up to the expectations raised by the ads. Anything beyond 2-4x was highly pixelized. In fact, though the colors were superb on this camera, most pictures were far worse in quality than my 8 megapixel point and shoot. I actually had to reduce the size of the images by half in order to cover up this camera's shortcomings. (which obviously makes the print capabilities fall short of the print sizes boasted which were supposed to be better than most point and shoots.) I found the macro to be lacking as well. I did side by side comparisons with my old 8 megapixel Canon A590IS and found that the canon beat it every time in macro, and almost every time in most other areas. Color was one of the exceptions. But I can get the same results by using photoshop to enhance the colors on my old camera's pictures. And yes it's nice to be able to zoom in on a bird in a tree a long distance away, but if the picture is so pixelized that you have to size it down to 300 by 300 pixels in order to make it look good, what's the point? Yes up close, it takes some decent pictures, but don't try to use the zoom. I say keep my a590 which I can buy lenses for until I save up enough for a real dslr. And honestly? If you want an SLR, spend about a hundred bucks or less more and buy a low end DSLR at around 10 megapixels. The image quality will be far better. For now, look up the cheaper point and shoots for around 60-150 and you'll get better shots than this. I can speak personally for the Canon models, but I'm sure some of the more basic Nikons are just as good. My personal experience with super zoom cameras is that they pretty much suck. Don't bother.

So far this camera has been used on a recent vacation and a school activity and has provided excellent quality shots both daytime and nighttime. The only negative I have found with the product is that you must manually raise the flash to activate auto flash. It can be seen as a positive, though. Sometimes it is annoying when you forget to raise it, and you need flash, but it is also helpful because then youknow for a fact that you will have a picture with flash or without flash depending on whether it is raised or not.

Mostly I use a Canon 40d but I got tired of risking it in the rain and saw this for a very good price and thought \"what the hell, a cheap backup, how bad can it be?\".  Not at all, actually.  I've used it on 5 houses so far, 2 with no electricity (and therefore no lights) perched on a monopod.  It generally is shooting at around a quarter to a third of a second wide open at pretty high ISO.  Worst case scenario.  Well, fact is it does great.  Some people here are complaining about low-light performance but I ain't one of them.  I'm thrilled with what the little pup can do with just a built-in flash even in fairly dark large rooms.  I won't say it does as well as the 40d with a 420ex flash.  Maybe it mostly does, I just won't say it, I paid too damn much for the Canon.  Best guess is that they really nailed the image stabilization algorithms.  Couple times I had to pick up the monopod to get a certain angle and then it may (or may not) blur a little.  So, dump $30 - $80 on a decent Manfrotto monopodManfrotto 681B Professional Aluminum Monopod (Black)as insurance, you'll probably be happy you did if you shoot low light.  Image quality is great.  Focusing is sometimes tricky - it wants to do what it wants to do, but I'm learning how to get around it most of the time. Every once in a while if I change a setting, say exposure compensation or flash type, it won't trip the shutter unless I go into scene mode and back out again.  Don't have to change anything, just hit the scene button twice.  Hopefully a firmware update will fix it.  Pretty easy to learn to use, there's really not all that much you can change, so if you play with it a couple hours trying all the settings you should be good to go.  I really like the little darlin, hope to have a long and fruitful relationship.  Given the quality of the photos and the fact that I can do a house in about half the time as I can with the 40d I expect I'll be grabbin this one more than half the time, save the Canon for special shoots.

I mean really close-up.  It has enough automatic modes that you can be very creative without needing a manual (as in, \"read the manual\") mode.  In fact, a great deal of photographic creativity has nothing whatsoever to do with setting apertures and shutter speeds.  (However, it is interesting that the camera does inform you what settings it's using for a shot.)  I have another P&S;, a Canon 500 HS, that gives me aperture and shutter priority modes, but I rarely use them - or need them - for lifestyle photography.  Most of the time the Canon stays home because it has limited zoom, which is much more important for this type of photography than tweaking exposure settings. Plus, there's always a lot of creative things you can do with your photo editing software if you've got a good shot to start with, and this Nikon will give you lots of good shots.The L120 isn't exactly a pocket camera, but it fits my belt pack just fine and I *rarely* carry a camera in my pocket anyway.  It has a nice solid feel and a much better grip profile than most P&S; cameras - more like a DLSR - and although I prefer knobs and dials from my old film SLR days, the touch screen is plenty fast and responsive.AF can be a little laggy, and at times the camera does seem to get confused about focus as some have mentioned.  However, I find that releasing and re-depressing the shutter button halfway usually grabs the focus, and if not a quick off-on cycle takes care of things.Low light (indoor ambience, lamp light) performance is more than adequate.  I like the flip-up flash (which separates it further from the lens axis than most P&S; cameras), and it performs very well.Cycle on to first shot and shot-to-shot speed is just fine.  The view/settings screen is quite sharp, although like most it does suffer some in direct bright sunlight.Video is just fine for this type of camera and casual short clips.  Would I use it to shoot \"Gone With The Wind\"?  Uh, no.  The audio is also perfectly adequate - again, you're not working with a boom mike.It's a huge bonus that this camera runs on normal AA batteries, too.  Although it seems to be pretty economical with battery life, there's nothing like being able to run into any 7-11 store (or most places in the world, for that matter) and get batteries if you need them.  If you've ever run out of those precious electrons while traveling, you can appreciate this.NO camera is everything to everybody, or even everything that any one person might want.

I love the stop action on the BUNCH of frames per second on sport mode. If you want to know how many I suggest you buy the camera. The 21X optical ZOOM feature is great.

I have been a true fan of Olympus cameras, thats all I ever had since they ever started making digital cameras I still have their first model from about 15 years ago. My camera got very slow to the point that I was barely able to use it. My photos were blurry and I needed a new camera.

Check out the photo above I uploaded of Derek jumping in the air (which is just about a second) and this camera clearly captured it even in Night mode! I love the wide angle and the zoom, it's very easy to switch scenes, the camera itself is very fast, reboots fast after turning on, I love the large LCD and even on Easy Auto mode the photos are clear and true in color. Oh, and there is a Pet mode scene, when you take a picture of a cat you can literally see the fur and the small eyelashes of the cat in such detail I was never able to get from a point and shoot before.

I did an upgrade from a Kodak 7.1 mp with x10 optical zoom to this L120.  I have had it for about a month now which has been plenty of time for an adjustment period:PROS:-The image quality is better. (that could be from the doubling my MP)-Can take several shots in Sports mode/action pics.  You can control the number to low/medium/high-The images are beautiful in low lighting. They are not blurry.  Don't always have to have that flash that can sometimes white out the image.-The battery life is great...I used the ones that came with the camera(which were AA akline). Still have 3/4 battery life.  After using camera several times a day.-CONS:-* the mannual is on a CD!  So it was really hard to figure out how the camera worked because you have to look it up answers on the computer (which was not always available)*-The Auto mode I do not like.  My Kodak took better images in auto mode.  I have tried several different scenarios alot of the time they would come out blurry.  So I pick my settings.

The Fuji offers a lot of manual control, which attracted me. I then had a look at Flickr's very handy \"camera finder\" function (I'm not allowed to post the address), which everyone should make use of when researching cameras for purchase.You can see for yourself, but, without fail, the L120's shots all look beautiful and vivid, even when their subjects were relatively uninteresting -- whereas, similarly without fail, shots from the Fuji look bland and uninteresting. One could make the argument that the Fuji simply makes more demands of the photographer since it does less automatically, but the uniform flat quality of nearly every image I looked at from the Fuji makes me think that's not the problem.When I ripped open the box and started shooting (after popping in a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB Class 6 card), I could see I'd made the right choice. The LCD on this camera has outstanding-enough resolution to immediately see that this camera produces beautiful shots each time, faithfully reproducing your real-life viewing experience; unlike other point-and-shoots that usually have me going \"Hmm, that's really not how it looked when I was there...\"I won't bore you with a feature list that you can already read in a million other places. Here's what I've observed since actually getting the camera:Pros:- Stunningly accurate shot quality (when shooting with at least medium light or flash)- LCD screen is exceptional- Excellent build quality, while still lightweight- Image stabilization is superb- Extremely easy to use- A quality video feature with good sound recording- Excellent PDF manual with lots of cross-reference links (when it refers to another page, there's a link to click that'll bring you there)- Includes a quality neck strap and lens coverCons:- Poor low-light performance. Night landscape shots, where flash is useless, come out grainy with inaccurate colors.- Severe lack of manual controls, no RAW output. If Nikon made a model that was an exact clone of the L120 but included the ability to switch to manual operation (focus, aperture, etc) and could output RAW format images, I would've easily paid another $50 for it. Though you can manually choose your ISO sensitivity (ie. film speed).- Video is not perfect (but you shouldn't expect perfect anyway; video is just a bonus feature on still cameras). The only problem is slight jitters (lack of adequate stabilization) when the camera is in motion, so this isn't a problem if it's stationary. Otherwise the video quality is excellent (using my SanDisk Class 6 card).- No in-camera panorama stitching. The camera does have an excellent panorama mode that overlays a portion of the last shot so you can line up the next one, but the shots need to be combined afterwards using the included software on a computer.- Batteries and memory card are accessed via the same door. This isn't usually an issue, but it is cumbersome since this camera uses 4 AA batteries that you need to compress down every time you close it. I end up using the USB cable for transferring most of the time, but it would be nice if the memory card had its own \"quick-access\" door.- Uses AA batteries. I've been waiting for camera makers to include rechargeable Li-Ion batteries that can charge while in the camera (like cell phones do), but no dice so far.- Form factor is too large for a pocket, which should be obvious (the tradeoff is getting to take awesome pictures instead of typical pocket-camera ones). I got the Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Case, which fits this camera like a glove, and still has plenty of room left over for wires and spare batteries.Tip: Video is initially set to focus on the first frame and maintain that focus throughout the recording. This is because continual re-focus causes the focus sounds to come through the mic and get recorded. You can enable continuous focus through the settings though.If you're looking for a point-and-shoot camera that simply takes awesome-quality pictures, you've found it.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have to play around with the settings!!", "Author": "mommakris", "ReviewID": "R3DJAZRGKERGAE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My mother has had this camera for months now, and i just got done borrowing it from her for a couple days.

Gregory", "ReviewID": "R59Z4U4HDADVK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I purchaced this yesterday from Best Buy, as it's three days before xmas and I need a camera to take pictures of my kids xmas morning!  I have a cannon powershot from 2007 that I loved, till it stopped focusing my pictures on me.  Grr.  I have always used a Cannon and Pentax 35 mm before that.  Yes, actual film.  So I was disapointed with reviews for current Cannon cameras so I looked at other brands.  Nikon is a reputaple brand.  I have also been taking photos for over 20 years now, been a proffesional photographer three times and worked in TV.  So I have a steady hand.  Having started with that.  This camera has many pros.it's not a bad size as a mid-level camera.  Not quite point and shoot, but not an DSLR either.  That's fine for me.It has an AMAZING zoom!  and many features for changing your settings if needed.  Takes an SD card.Downside.I'm used to AA's in my camera vs. the rechargable ones.  But it would have been nice.  I'm the type who needs to replace them, of course just in that important setting.  So I can go buy somemore, and done.  Vs.  It's dead, wait for it to recharge. It's a personal choice for the batteries.  Does add a bit of extra weight.  Again, a personal choice.Lens cap will bother some people.  I'm an old school user, so it doesn't bother me as much.The flash in auto mode for low light situations is only gonna come on if you pop the thing up to begin with.  Just FYI.  It won't pop up on it's own.  Little stupid in the design of the thing.The zoom.  Which yes I said was amazing.  And it is.  IF your zoomed in and it's on a tripod.  I zoom in on one of my kids, or dogs from across the room ( cause at 7 yrs and 15 months they don't hold still for long) and even if they are NOT moving, it still looks like someone hit my hand as I lightly touched the button!  OH I CAN\"T STAND THAT!!!  IF I hold it down and it's foucus ( according to the manual ) and I press the button why is it so sensitive!!!!!  OMG.  It's much improved of course if your not zoomed it, but it still happend.  I tripoded the thing and lightly touched the button to take a picture of a non moving item ( my xmas tress) and it was still blurry.  ????  It only improved (greatly might I add) if the flash was up.  Which I don't understand cause I had plenty of light in my shot. And again, nothing was moving.  But it still looks like you slaped my hand last second while holding the camera.  This of course is with the image stabillity thing on.IF it were not for that I'd give it five stars.HOW can it be a 14 MP camera and so many features and be so sensitive???!!  Otherwise this would be an outstanding camera right out of the box.  I'm thankful I have a seperate video camera for xmas.  But I'm gonna play with the thing for a few more days.  Only because I want some pic for xmas ( something is better than nothing ) and maybe I'm missing something.  Maybe it's defective the over sensetivity thing.  I''ll update this again after xmas and give my final judgement.It has video but I haven't used it yet.  So unless someone else has the touchy movement thing also we shall see if it's just mine, or poor design on Nikons part.Great camera for settings and picture quality otherwise.  If focusing wasn't an issue right now, this would be an amazing camera.***UPDATE***So it's May 2012 now.I still think this thing is okay.  I will say yes to the person who said turn off the Image Stabilizer while on a tripod.  I knew that, and could have explained that nugget of wisdom better.  So thank you.  While I like the camera still, I don't love it for my kids or pets.  The best shots come when you have the flash up.  So if you have people that hate to be blinded they won't love you for this cammera.  I have to re-take some of people just because they blink.  The time you have to wait from when you take one picture, till you can snap the next one is SLOW.  It irritates the crud out of me!  SO MUCH!  I think that in proper lighting or being outside I should be able to snap a shot without having the flash up.  Even if it doesn't go off, it still takes a better picture then if I leave it down.  I find that irritating and retarded.  Don't get me wrong, my shots look GREAT otherwise!  I don't use it for video still.  Perhaps I'll test that out...  I just don't think this is a good camera for capturing small kids or pets.  Anything else, perfect.  Just spend time testing it out on things you don't NEED to have a picture of.  Get to know it's settings, what works best where.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, they do help.I use rechargable AA's in this.  I keep at least one/two sets charged and in my camera bag for when the set in the camera go.  I use less batteries that way, and they last just as long... and I'm snap happy!  It cost less in the long run to buy these kind up front vs. over the life of your camera, and all the ones you'll feed into it.Happy Snapping!", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "marsha", "ReviewID": "RMF5YCQQTXS3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Nikon is great.

I just wasn't happy with it though. Doing a lot of hiking I wanted a camera that took good shots. So I grumpily started looking at camera's again and looked at the Kodak Z981 and Z991 bridge camera's--still wanting to stay with Kodak.  I'm not sure how I fell into the Nikon L120, but in comparing it to the Kodaks and the Canon sx30is (?), reviews were good consistently and pictures appeared to be better, so I decided to take the plunge and buy the Nikon.  LOVE this camera! Easy to use, no complicated menu's, crisp clear pictures. The camera self adjusts ISO quickly and accurately. I seldom use the flash even indoors. Pictures are rarely blurry, even on zoom they are acceptably clear--without a tri-pod. I'm on the Nikon L120 page on FB, where over the last full moon a young man in India (or somewhere in that area) took a pic of the moon, I laughed and said it looked like my moon, so posted mine--on both you could see the shading on the moon. Someone took a pic of the half moon (he must have used a tri-pod) and you could even see the craters. Phenomenal. My sister-in law has a high end Canon, and even on her zoom extension couldn't get the detail. The detail on macro is incredible and, to my eye anyway, indistinguishable from a DSLR.I put lithium battery's in it and they are still hanging in there, so I'm very satisfied with the battery life.  I absolutely recommend this camera for anyone who might want a little more than a compact will offer,  who wants to be able to get creative but still have the ease of an automatic.***Just an update, still love it, and take it snowshoeing with me, as well as roam around the country finding old barns, etc. People always ask me what kind of camera I'm using.

It's not reliable and very finicky. The pet setting is the best way to shoot moving subjects, although not perfect, it does take a pretty good sport photo with vr stabilization on. In pet mode you are able to take one picture at a time and the pictures come out quite well in sunlight. (play around with settings a bit to get a decent IQ) Continuous shots are available too, but not as smooth operating as other cameras i've used. The problem I have is indoor movement pictures. Without flash options on pet setting or continuous sport mode, my pictures are very substandard. I want to capture my kids blowing out their candles, roughhousing with each other, unwrapping presents, etc. If I were able to use flash mode it would be a much better camera for moving subjects. Don't get me wrong, I've gotten excellent pictures of my kids sitting still, and good ones of them moving outside, but anything inside with any movement is very hard to capture. Even outside pics are going to be blurry IF you aren't using the correct settings. For landscape photos and close ups this camera is very good.

There is a bit of a learning curve for those who are used to just pointing and shooting pictures on a standard digital camera.  My advice is to play with each mode available to determine in what situations what mode will give you the best quality pictures.  Eventually it will become second nature to you.Also, with certain modes it does take some time for the focus to become clear.  I have found that backing out the zoom and slowly zooming in on your target will produce a better focus.  I will be purchasing a tripod as this will also help with picture quality for modes where you are zooming in (no matter how steady you think you are, even with the anti-shake on, you will find it takes a lot of skill to get a clear picture because you are moving the camera even when you don't think you are).Also, this is what I call a two-stage snapper.  When you press the button to take a photo, the first stage brings the picture into focus and the second actually takes the photo.

(No changing of aperture or F stop, or anything really). You have to mess with all of the presets to find what works in each situation. (This isn't an issue for us, we really got this camera to pull out and capture moments anywhere and anytime, and the presets are amazing.)-The flash doesn't automatically flip up when low light is detected, you have to do it manually.-In \"Easy Auto\" mode, it is impossible to get the flash to remain \"on\", it is always auto and resulted in motion blurred photos.

I would first like to simply confirm everything Mr. Rosenow has said about this camera.  For those of you, like myself, however, who are looking for a truly impressive point and shoot, I can confidently say, \"look no further\".  Within less than a half hour out of the box, I was taking outdoor pictures that were truly impressive for a camera at this price point.  I sent a few of these off to a friend of mine whose husband is a professional photographer and she reported back how impressed she was with their quality.  Then I took some panoramic pictures of my back field and stitched them together with the incredibly easy-to-use software that is included without even reading the manual first, and I've never even done this before!  The results blew me away.  Once I actually read the manual, I got even better results.If I have a single complaint, it would be with the quality of my indoor shots. Some of my photos tended to be quite grainy. But please bear in mind that I have a LOT to learn about photography yet, so you must take this \"complaint\" with a very large grain of salt.  I think once I work with this camera a bit more and learn more about indoor lighting techniques, I have a feeling this will become a non-issue.  I still rated image quality with a 5 based on the results of all of my outdoor shots.  Most of those photos were of my animals who are sometimes in constant motion and, using the Pet mode (called a \"scene\" on the menu), they turned out terrific.  Please note:  I used a tripod in most cases.Again, I don't have a lot to add to Mr. Rosenow's excellent review.

When I first got the camera I was so excited. I immediately opened the box and started getting to know the camera. Like every love story, there are a few bumps in the road to happiness. The first thing I noticed is that the sport continuous feature is not my favorite. In fact, my CoolPix from a few years ago has a better sport feature. There's lots of noise in the picture, and the edges are fuzzy sometimes. After fiddling with it for a while, and reading the manual, the fuzzy edges were no longer a problem. But there is still a lot of noise in the picture. I live right near the attractions in Orlando so I headed to Universal and took some pictures in the Wizarding World. The second thing I noticed was that the lens cap falls off easily when in a carrying case. The third thing I noticed was that the battery life is not wonderful. After reading previous reviews I was prepared for that, and I had rechargable batteries ready. However there are some really great features to this camera. Inside lighting is not a problem. Inside the castle at the wizarding world is very dark. This camera had no problem with this, and I have some amazing pictures from the portrait gallery. No flash needed. Adjusting the ISO is very easy, but most of the time you don't need to do any adjusting. My favorite feature with this camera, however, has to be the macro mode. It has a great zoom, which is great for sporting events and such. Since yesterday was the 4th, I also got a chance to try out the fireworks mode, which turns out is nice. It has a longer exposure than my other cameras, which is fun when you have sparklers and you can do light writing. All in all, I really do love this camera.

But if you are the average consumer this is an easy, semi affordable camera with a whoppin 21x zoom!!! 14 mp is good too.  I was not overly impressed with the panorama mode, not that many people use this feature, but basically when you do a panorama with many other camera's it helps you take the photo, then stitches things together for you.

I must say that if you are patient and are not using the zoom very much that the camera is not that bad; however why would one purchase a camera that has its features unusable? The zoom at great lengths is quite difficult to produce a blurry-free picture. The focus time increases as the zoom is extended - an issue NOT seen with most point and shoot cameras at the same distance and NOT an issue for the more expensive bridge cameras (ones like this that are not quite a DSLR, but not a point-and-shoot either). I know that most people are quite upset when a camera does not meet the standards or expectations they had, but you must really read the reviews, play with it at the store, and then make a sound decision about purchasing. I did all these steps and still ended up returning the camera less than 24 hours later because I did not want to \"settle\".If you are wanting an entry-level bridge camera for taking still shots and are quite patient with the focus and reload time, this camera will work for you. If you are looking for quick action shots, long zoom use and such, I would suggest staying with the point-and-shoot or upgrading to a compact camera or DSLR.A few things that might sway you one way or the other: the flash is a manual pop-up (good and bad), it takes AA batteries (I suggest buying rechargeable ones from Amazon - they're inexpensive here), it has small internal memory (not found very often in cameras now-a-days), plenty of scene options, easy menus.I hope this helps!", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet low ligth pictures !

I also bought at another warehouse that starts with the letter C, the Coolpix S8100, as that also has good reviews and is fairly zippy in the speed department (bootup, shot to shot and burst mode). The difference is night and day. I am going to post up a picture of a comparison shot I did, with the S8100 right out of the box. Let me put it this way, after two L120's (I REALLY wanted to love this camera), on this one shot of the S8100, I took 8 shots with the L120, and NONE of them came out as clear as the S8100. Only one came close, and after looking at it on the display, I redid the shot, same settings and it was more blurry than before. EIGHT SHOTS!!!!! I ahve a 16GB card, but EIGHT SHOTS for none to come out clear???? Unacceptable. I'm not a fool, I've taken digital photography courses, and know how to hold and shoot a camera. But the quality was unacceptable. I'm glad some of you have taken great pictures. Maybe Sam is getting junk at his club, but TWO???? C'mon. Look for the picture of the Toy Story cups. Its sad to see this camera go, but it must.______________I bought this camera after extensive reviews. Everyone generally seems to like it and only a few complain about the quality and the blurriness of the photos. I am now in that complaining group. We got this camera because our old Canon A540 died on us. I know the wife was the reason as she always complained about the slow shot to shot speed of that one. So while she wanted something faster, I wanted something that had a better zoom, and actually felt like a camera. I was hoping, before it died, to replace it next year, with the Lumix GF3 that was coming out next month. I figured next year's tax money would pay for the camera. However, we couldn't wait, nor did we want to spend $600+ on a camera. sooooo....I bought the camera from one of the big warehouse stores. I LOVE the camera in terms of how it feels, the options, etc. The continous mode was great. very speedy. I've held and tested various Fuji and Kodak models, and I wasn't impressed with the menus of the Fujis and the Kodak, i've always felt something was missing. I was told Asthon Kucher used this in a commercial so I joked I would take it back then. since this was the first dSLR-looking camera we had, I started to read the manual to try and figure it out first. I am the one that usually figures the settings out, and the wife usually does the auto.. So, I'd take a few pics of the kids on various settings to see which was better. Throughout it all, the camera was very hit or miss in terms of quality.Let me explain. On some shots, like of the kids from about 15 feet away zoomed in, I'd do the Easy Auto and it would be ok. slight blurry of them. I'd move to another mode, and really blurry. I'd go back to the easy and it would be blurry. I'd do several, just to make sure the kids didn't move (while telling them to not move) or I moved, but each time they'd get blurry, some more than others. Same thing with using flash. I don't like how I cannot dial the flash down, like the A540's, but the camera did take better shots without the flash in some instances, than the A540. However, again, sometime the camera would get blurry. I found that in many instances, if the kids were anywhere close, the Auto mode, with Flash fill worked best. But then again, sometimes it was good, others not, but usually it was.Outside was better. I took pics of the kids running around in the sprinklers and they generally came out ok.But it wasn't as good as our old pokey A540. For the price of the camera, the pics should have been better. Taking longer zoom pics generally were blurry, even with the vibration and antishake enabled. I tried changing the focusing modes, ISO, etc, and it didn't help. The wife wanted to get rid of it before and get a cheaper one, but I insisted to give it another try as the cheaper ones wouldn't be as fast. However, the quality kept being a disappointment.Since I REALLY want to like this camera, I took it back and got another one, which was fine for me, as the price went down, and as a result, the extended warranty did too. So for less then the camera in the 1st place, I got the camera and extended warranty.Initial shots showed the same issues, but we will see this weekend. I'll post up an update. However, I am now looking at the Nikon S8100 as it has a 10x zoom, and is very speedy. I may buy that one and do side by sides when I use them both to compare. I also like the Canon S4500 too.

I was able to see great details from pretty far away even beyond the camera's yellow bar indicating the focus was AF.One of my main gripes from my experience was the sunrise/sunset mode and taking pictures at dusk of the many colors and faces which and who graced our early morning and evening walks. The flash was a bit much and made images a little garish, something I was able to somewhat address with some editing software but I am not a big flash fan anyway and would rather not use it. The shutter ended up being open too long. Some pictures with the blurry looked arty while others were throwaways, er, deletes. And I agree with another reviewer who mentioned the annoying lens cap as well as losing precious time if I turned on the camera without first removing it.But my #1 gripe is that it used AA batteries and it is one hungry beast. I could not use rechargeables and I went through so many batteries it was embarrassing. I wish it had a NiCad battery which would not only reduce environmental waste but the charge would last longer. No one likes hauling a 36 pack around in one's day pack. Based on that my next camera purchase will definitely have an internal battery charge feature.I  think if I spent a little more time learning about the L120 and anticipating its peculiarities my next set of adventure photos will be that much better.

That camera would say batteries were dead even though they really had half the charge left.  So, I finally gave in to my partner and got this camera so that I'd stop complaining. What happened is I've traded one complaint for another - sigh...So far, I've not had to change the batteries in this camera so it's tons better than the Canon in that regard.  What I don't like, and this is true of almost all the digital point and shoot cameras now, is that there is no view finder.  I was hoping that the larger LCD screen would make it easier to use in bright sunshine, but that is not the case.  I was on a whale watching trip recently and didn't manage to get the whale in any of the still shots I took.  I did manage to get it in one piece of video.  Whether that would have been different had I had a viewfinder, I can't say for sure, but I would have been more comfortable.  However, having said that, I would also say this is a nice camera.If you don't want to spring for the big bucks of an SLR (and I didn't) this camera is reasonably priced and does a good job.  It seems that camera manufacturers have taken pity on us and gotten together on their controls because the controls on this are very similar to my Canon so that made for a much easier learning curve initially.  However, I'm sure there is much to learn to take full advantage of all the features of this camera.It did take me a while to figure out how to force the flash.  The camera doesn't come with a printed manual - it's on a CD - so if you need to look up how to do things, you'll need a computer handy.  Overall, I think I will really enjoy using this camera once I get past the lack of the viewfinder.

I ask permission to take pictures as often as possible; however, people aren't home, etc. etc. and if I don't want to miss a great photo opportunity, I will often take pictures from the road and sometimes at great distance.  The zoom lens is great for me.My Coolpix also takes great pictures, but I am not always good at making the picture perfectly straight and sometimes the lighting isn't what I thought it was when I took the picture.  Fortunately for me, a great little program came with my camera which was easily downloaded to my computer.  I can quickly edit my photos by cropping, straightening, adjusting lighting, etc.  Then, I send these photos into my Adobe Elements program for further editing before printing.The only negative comment I have is the size and bulk of this model camera.  It is rather heavy for me to carry on a strap around my neck and it does not fit into my purse.  If I could rate this camera a 4.5 stars, that would better describe my opinion.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is bad", "Author": "Abdulaziz", "ReviewID": "R38L0IRJFMPXTK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I couldn't use it more than 5 minutes.

Haven't tried all the different functions, but it is easy to use, with plenty of options to create.An updated review.......I would like to enlighten customers about this camera and the seller, Crawfords Superstore. I started having problems taking pictures during the holidays. I bought this camera in February of 2013. So I contacted Nikon about my issue. They had me send it send to their service center. Waited to head from them, only to find out the one year warranty was not valid and they wanted over $100 to repair. I bought this camera thinking it was brand new from Crawfords Superstore. After finding out I was sold a refurbished camera, I contacted Amazon and the seller. After voicing my displeasure to both on my purchase, I was promised by the seller he would make this right if I sent him the camera and he would send me another camera. After 3 weeks of getting the camera back from the manufacturer and sending it to the seller, I wound up getting a refund and no camera this week. Not very happy on how this went down with the seller, Crawfords Superstore, and the Amazon representative I contacted trying to resolve my problem as soon as possible. I discovered through other reviews, that this was not the first time this seller sold refurbished or used merchandise as new. The last 2 conversations I had with their representative were rude and was lied to about how he was going to resolve this issue satisfactory. It didn't turn out that way, and the Amazon rep that I talked about this problem was hard to understand and she did not have her supervisor contact me as she said she would. This was a very bad experience, and hopefully I will not have to deal other sellers through Amazon taking advantage of Amazon members.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "nikon coolpix l120", "Author": "amanda holstine", "ReviewID": "R1V8D9PX7WAGEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera was exactly what I ordered.

Most camera enthusiasts know the importance of putting a filter on the lens to protect it from scratches.  Usually a simple UV or skylight filter is used for this.  If you can afford to keep buying low-cost cameras such as the L120, then scratches might not be a problem, but they will impair your photos.Some of the Coolpix cameras appear to have threads on the lens that appear to take a filter.  This very deceptive, because those threads in fact do not allow a filter.  This was confirmed to me via a phone call to Nikon.  The only exception is the Coolpix 7700.  Nikon tech support believes the inclusion of digital filters built into the firmware of the camera are sufficient.  But digital filters will not protect the lens from scratches.  When your lens gets a scratch, you have to send the camera off to Nikon to get it fixed or buy a new camera.In the Nikon camera series, you have to get an SLR $$$$$ to take a filter, the Coolpix 7700 excepted.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tried to like it, but...", "Author": "K.

After 3 months of using it regularly, the quality of the photos suddenly diminished; outdoors they were acceptable but indoors they turned dark and blurry and very white if I tried using flash, I had to shoot about 20 photos to be able to get at least one that was OK. Another problem was that the camera was triggered automatically whenever I focused to make the shoot.I thought that perhaps it was just a matter of adjustment and seek for the help of experienced amateur photographs to overcome the problem, yet remained the same, they were not able to fix it, any adjustment they tried simply did not worked. At the time my camera was still protected with warranty so I contacted Nikon explaining the problem, I was asked several questions and had to follow a process in their web site, I was asked to upload photo samples for them to be able to assess the problem. Despite my detailed explanation and pictures that clearly evidence that my photos were not good at all, they only said in one single line that was a problem of adjustment without giving any further explanation, without considering any of my explanation nor the fact that we had tried to adjust the camera several times.Today, after more than one year of not doing anything with the camera, I finally decided to to bring it to a camera repair center, no such explanation was necessary to identify that the problem with the camera was the lens, probably due to home failures turning it difficult to focus and control the vibrations resulting in blurry photo shoots.I do not recommend this product, this was the first product I purchased from Nikon and it will be the last one. A company that does not have the slightest interest in knowing what are the flaws of their products is not worth your money. Not to mention that I have to pay 150USD for changing the lenses when this could have been easily covered by the camera guarantee when I reported the problem.Jannell.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "koolpics", "Author": "Jacques Bancelin Ariano \"Lovelysystems\"", "ReviewID": "R3J7J2KM5RKXP3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do not like to buy batteries and this product runs on 4 AA, but takes nices pics and video, nice lens and zoom.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "i like it", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3OVAPKPBHRUZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the only thing that i dont like is that the pics are blurry when peolpe are moving even when you put it in that picture mode.

Since then I have used it a lot and feel like I can give a full review. I was kind of disappointed by the zoom. It worked really well up to about 10x, but after that the camera couldn't focus. The camera quality is extremely grainy and washed out. I was really looking forward to something really high quality. The pictures themselves often turn out blurry. This is because the camera sets the shutter speed, and sometimes decides that it should take a whole second to take the picture!!! This really disappointed me and as a result many of the pictures turned out blurry. Also landscape and scenic pictures seem kind of washed out.Some of the things I did like included its viewing screen. It is 3-inches wide, with amazing picture viewing quality. And with the 14.1 megapixel camera, I definitely have gotten some amazing pictures. And like I said, the zoom worked really well at up to 10x, which is pretty good, even if I was really excited about 21x.Overall this camera is at a very affordable price, and is like a slightly higher tech point in shoot, with a cool, sleek body. It's a good camera for a beginning photographer (like me), but in the future, to take higher quality shots I will definitely get something a little more advanced, like a DSLR, but I will hang on to this little guy!Oh, and to answer the question in the title for my review, I would say this camera is worth it for beginner photographers, but if you are more advanced or even professional and are looking for something a little higher tech than a point and shoot, but lower tech than a DSLR, then I would keep looking. It doesn't have many of the features higher grade cameras do, and if you are used to working with those higher grade cameras, you will find yourself extremely frustrated with this camera.Hope this helped!!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great supplement for an SLR", "Author": "Laurel \"Crowning Laurel\"", "ReviewID": "R128M5WGFR0GEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find the perfect tag-along camera for my bulky SLR.

We would strongly recommend it to others seeking a wider capability of telephoto lens and flexible controls for special shots.

Using the camera is pretty easy once you get used to the layout.  Nikon wants you to basically pick your type of shot (night, pet, fireworks etc) from a menu, and then they set the camera up for optimum conditions.  But that is annoying.  I find more advanced Nikon cameras easy enough to use, I just don't like the weight.  I would call it an intermediate camera from the $100 point and shoot crowd to the price point of the $500 SLRs out there.I would go into a camera store and examine one before buying it to be sure of what you are getting.

I was intrigued by the optical zoom and the Nikon name. I am familiar with Nikon's SLRs, and have used L110s at work.First, the L120s body feels plastic and flimsy in comparison to the L110. Not sure what the difference is or why that would be, but the L110 seems sturdy and well put together. The L120 feels like a dressed up camera from some brand you've never heard of but found for a really good deal at a flea market.Second, to its credit the L120 performed admirably outside. The images were crisp and clear with good color balance. The L110s I've used were done so primarily outdoors, so this is not a surprise.Third, the L120 performed horribly and inconsistently indoors. For example, sitting at my kitchen table I set the camera to auto. I then snapped two pictures, one after the other. One looked fine, but the other had a horrible yellow tint to it. No flash was used for either photograph, the same settings were used, and there were no lighting changes, just click and click. What that's about is beyond me.Fourth, as mentioned above the L120 performed inconsistently. I took a series of photographs of my wife with the L120. Some were focused and clear, others were slightly blurry, and others looked as if I Photoshopped my wife into the picture. Other photos were grainy, much like those produced by my 7-year old, 3 megapixel Sony point and shoot that cost roughly 1/3 of the L120.Fifth, other complaints include an awkward menu system, a \"hidden\" stabilization option in that my wife found it, but it certainly isn't in an obvious place and could not be found by me without looking in the manual, a lack of something as basic as a manual option, use of weird terminology in \"sports\" mode menu, and probably a few other things I've forgotten.Overall, I would not recommend this camera. It's not worth the money - even at Amazon prices. I am entirely disappointed. I don't understand how a company like Nikon would attach their name to such a subpar product. The presence of a 21x optical zoom does not make up for other, glaring shortcomings.

I am dismayed to say that EVERY Photo taken with this camera was Blurred, poorly lit even when flash was used and even in video the movie and sound quality are the worst I have ever seen. All photos both indoors and outdoors are awful in every way you can think of. More then one person took photos using this camera even a professional photographer and all are bad. Not a single one worth keeping. I bought this because I had not seen these relatives since I was a kid and wanted photographs for memories. Now I will have to rely on just my memory. I used the no name brand $20.00 camera I bought for my 12 year old daughter for some pictures and though it does not take great photos it blew away the photos taken with the Nikon l120.Unfortunately The receipt had gotten lost on our trip. I purchased it The day after easter of this year 2011. Basically now I am stuck with a camera I will never use and out the $279.99 it cost. I usually love nikon products but this is the exception. I will now think twice before buying Nikon again no matter how good the reviews are.I had to give it ! star only because it would not let me leave it at 0 stars which is what it should be.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned it.", "Author": "Ron K.
