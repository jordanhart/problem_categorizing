It is a very small camera but it is very thick. It is made of plastic and looks and feels like a cheap toy. The flash is very slow loading regardless of the batteries you use. The picture quality is awful even at 12mp. It takes better pictures outside in the sun but the pictures from my old 5mp camera are clearer and brighter. This might be a good camera for a child to use but the price is to high for that. I would not recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": ":(", "Author": "Ahcemal", "ReviewID": "RCI2AO3HOSAY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The quality of this item is extremely poor, it drains the battery within minutes literally, I'm unable to use this camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "J. CROSBY \"jcrosbychi\"", "ReviewID": "RGOCJICKL0LR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great. Its small enough to fit in a purse and takes great pictures. I keep a couple of extra betteries in my purse just in case, but so far I've had nothing but good results with it. My only complaint is that the flash is a little slow to charge, but other than that it does the job more than adequately. Definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small camera that takes good pictures.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "12 Mega Pixel Max Resolution; 5.0 Mega Pixel CMOS Sensor\n2.7\" LCD Screen\n8x Digital Zoom; Uses SD/SDHC memory cards up to 16GB (not included)\n12 Picture modes with auto face detection and smile detection\nIncludes 2 AAA batteries, photo editing software, camera pouch and 1 year Bell+Howell warranty", "Name": "Bell+Howell S9 Slim 12 MP Digital Camera with 8x Digital Zoom and 2.7' LCD Screen", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WM0uDFT3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004XNFHQ2"}}
