The camera is easy to use.  The kit has everything you need to get started.  We like the magnetic closing of the camera case.  The close up phot option takes great pics.  We have had this camera for over a year with no issues at all.  I cannot attest to its connectivity to a computer, since we simply pop the memory card out and hook it up to our card reader.  Works perfectly every time.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Russell Lewandowski \"Russell\"", "ReviewID": "R24E0FDZCTEJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why not get the whole kit for less than the major stores sell the camera?  This basic snap and shoot camera has plenty of resolution, and the image is stable.  Pink works for my wife, and she is totally happy.  The tiny battery runs down more quickly than my C class Olympus, but again, the camera is about the size of a pack of smokes.  Buy it.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Box Contents - FE-340 Pink Digital Camera, Li-42B Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery and charger, USB cable, Audio/Video cable, Wrist strap, Manual, Master 2 Software CD-ROM, premium leather case, photo storage box and 4x6 frame\n8.0 Megapixels, 1/2.35 CCD, up to 3,264 x 2,448 resolution, 640 x 480 (30/15fps) AVI Movie\n48MB Internal Memory - We recommend purchasing an optional 2GB xD-Picture Card for practical usage\nImage Stabilizer\nFace Detection mode", "Name": "Olympus FE-340 Pink Camera Deluxe Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gDPmgBREL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0017ODZCS"}}
