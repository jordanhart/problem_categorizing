I love that I don't have to keep using batteries like I do with my other cameras. I also enjoy manually winding and rewinding the film. But on the other hand I can't find the battery for the flash (like it's not sold anywhere..), so I've never used the flash. Also, it looks a little too simple and fun because people have thought that it's a toy camera and make fun of it (definitely pissed about that). And it's difficult to get pictures to turn out the right way, many were blurry or overexposed (in a bad way). The viewfinder doesn't look the way the pictures will. Long exposures look amazing. The multiple exposures look awesome, although I don't always get that method right. All in all, I would recommend this camera to someone who loves antiques or simplicity.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD", "Author": "Francoliver", "ReviewID": "R2HN2NHBZ6DGS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EVERYTHING WONDERFUL !
