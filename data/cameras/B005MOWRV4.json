Well, first of all, I am a photo bug that love street and landscape photography, I have number of full frame DSLRs, and some heavy lenses; however since once I brought all of my gears to go on a trip to Thailand, I understood that making \"good\" photos are not an easy job, physically. Then I decided not to bring too many heavy gears when I go travelling.Alright, lets talk about this camera, which is our main topic. You might heard about Ricoh's GR series cameras since the film photographers' era; GR series are famous of its compact size, good handling and professional control functions. For this specific camera, GR Digital IV, it has the 28mm wide angle prime lens on it, with f/1.9 maximum aperture and image stabilization, very convenient for not only low-light condition, but also creating shallow Bokeh. However, GRD IV only gets a small 1/1.7 CCD sensor in it, bigger sensor literally means better image quality. About this point, different people may have different idea. So personally, I would not recommend to beginner to get it in this price range, for whom many Mirrorless cameras and entry-level DSLRs could be more suitable. But I would highly recommend to the ones who are looking for a compact alternative of heavy cameras for specific purposes, like me myself.GRD IV has many interesting features such as many custom functions allow you to create a comfortable control system; two multi-function dials, number of custom buttons, a M-A-S-P dial with three custom-mode, also variety of pictures effects. The external button layout is nice and neat, no superfluous design. Superior build quality, you will know where your money goes when you hold it in your hands. Also, Ricoh offers us different accessories like lens hood, wide angle attached lens, viewfinders and cases, you might wanna get some for your GRD IV.Overall I am happy to give a five-star rating to this camera, for the features that I introduced to you, also I will update my review and some pictures taken by it. Thanks for reading.- Apr 10 2012---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been using this camera for two days, everything is going well, and I found out this little camera is extremely good at taking macro shots, your lens can actually touch the subject and still able to focus! I have taken several macros in Raw files, they turned out very nice, sharp and beautiful Bokeh...Also, the mode \"My sense\"  actually got more interesting in-camera processing, such as long exposure for taking star tracks, high dynamic rage shots, all done in camera. However I haven't tried them out yet, I'm gonna find a good day to take some shots at night using those interesting features. They are many different combinations in My modes (you have three my modes on the M-A-S-P dial). For examples, I like to shoot in RAW, however when you are wondering to use the in camera pre-set like Hi-contrast, B&W;, Hi-pass etc, you can only shoot in JPEG, RAW files would not have anything else other than original image information. In this case I set the MY1, MY3, MY3 modes into different JPEG modes, with different pre-set combinations, different metering and focusing mode, very convenience! If I want to shoot RAW, I can just turn the dial to M-A-S-P, other than that I use \"My modes\" to shot interesting JPEG pictures. Since the in-camera processes are so decent, it saves my time to do the post process for the snap shots.Simply saying I found this camera is such a fun toy to play, easy and amazing, and nice handling like DSLRs, professional point&shoot;!-Apr 18 2012 by Ben", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great street camera.", "Author": "artguy", "ReviewID": "R1BEO57KMMKVRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in the design field so anything smartly designed is appealing. Love that this camera does only a few things but does it well. The lens is amazing and the more you play with the camera, the more you appreciate the ergonomics and menu system. Normally I'm an automatic point and shoot guy but it is easy to get your head around the controls after a short learning period and you can intuitively adjust settings. This is the best \"artist's\" camera I've ever had for adjusting on the fly.  Ricoh did a very nice of of deciding what was necessary. I'm sure most people looking at a GR Digital 4 know it's great for black and white photography which is true, but I also like the color that comes out of it. Been using it for a short period but have already shot some of the best photos I've ever shot.It took a little while to get used to not having zoom but zoom has never been a big deal for me since I like doing street photography. If you really want zoom this is not the camera for you. Also the autofocus is fast which was the main reason I switched from a Canon S95. I was getting frustrated with how slow it focused in indoor situations.The camera is built like a tank which is a huge plus since I'm a klutz.Easily the best and funnest camera I've ever owned.Update: 1/23/13: This is by far the best camera I've ever had and have taken my best photos with it. I'm not overly techy but the wider lens is super sharp and fits my eye. When it's darker I shoot b&w; and the graininess adds to the mood. The menu is a pleasure and already feels like second nature to use.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great pocket camera", "Author": "Jim Gerdy \"jjg\"", "ReviewID": "R23O3I0SFLV9Z9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my favorite point and shoot. Details are well covered in many camera forums. I bought it because it has manual controls and good ergonomics for dialing in your exposure and focus manually. So it's sort of a choice for pros as a backup camera. I limitation is the 6mm sensor. You certainly don't get the image quality of a larger 24mm or 35mm sensor camera. But for a sub-$1000 point and shoot its fine.If you want a camera with lots of automatic intelligence and don't want to think like a photographer this is probably not ideal for the price. Cheaper cameras will give the sensor quality and give you face recognition, zoom lenses and other perks.Some things I came to appreciate are: - strong alloy body. I haven't had an accident but feel it would hold up well - f/1.9 lens. Even with the wide focal length there is some selective focus and nice bokeh - you can turn the viewscreen off to make the camera very unobtrusive in low light - it is quiet. Shutter is almost silent - takes attachments, super wide, tele, and nice viewfinder accessories - the autofocus is quick and accurate. With the wide lens it's a forgiving spec but still the whole package is easy to use and get a focused picture. - the size is great. Even for a point and shoot it's small. Fits in a pocket and can go everywhere. - battery life is best of all digital cameras I have (various SLRs and point and shoots)", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ricoh GR DIGITAL IV US 10 MP Digital Camer...", "Author": "blissbb", "ReviewID": "R1HOKLH990EYVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the best camera that i ever had if you looking for a small but good quality camera! this is it!!", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "28mm equiv.\n10.0 M Pixels\n3.0 inch LCD screen\nLimited Edition", "Name": "Ricoh GR DIGITAL IV US 10 MP Digital Camera with 1x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD screen (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wB84g9pDL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005MOWRV4"}}
