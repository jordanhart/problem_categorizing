{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera, so-so freebies", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R1LPWC5AHFCOWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this package deal as it was the same price as getting just the camera and lens without all the other stuff in the package, so I figured it couldn't hurt.  Everything promised is included and new, but some of the additional stuff is pretty cheap, though not all of it.  The bag is pretty nice and actually larger than I had anticipated, with plenty of room for this gear and quite a bit more.  The memory card is large and fast enough for HD video recording.  The extra battery works fine and it is always nice to have a spare.  The cleaning kit is pretty simple, but it works.  The screen protector works well, you must cut it out to the proper shape though, really not a big deal.  The UV filter was incredibly difficult to get threaded properly on the lens, and I will be replacing it soon with a different brand.  The main weak point of the kit is the tripod.  The tripod is cheap feeling and not very sturdy.  As I tightened the screws to lock everything in place, the plastic pieces creaked with even slight pressure.  I will use this tripod for now while indoors, but will be replacing it as soon as I can.All in all:Great cameraGood lens, bag, battery, screen protector, cleaning kit and memory cardPretty bad UV filterVery bad tripodStill, everything but the body and lens came as a free bonus, so I don't see why you wouldn't go with this over just the body and lens.  If you already have a lens that fills the space of the 18-135 in this kit, just get the body and save the money to get nicer accessories.Update:  The price of the bundle has increased, and I would strongly consider getting just the body or body + kit lens.  The extra stuff was nice, but I would not have bought this kit at the current price ($100 ish more than the body+kit lens)", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon 60D", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3F03Q2PLMN3AF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything came brand new and everything was correct.

It came 10 days after the order date. The customer service reps were very rude and they probably need some training. I definitely would NOT GO BACK to this seller to buy anything else. Even the freebies that come with the camera are not good. Tripod is shaky and I probably would need to order better quality one. After reading the seller rating/reviews, I found out that other users have also had similar problems and had to deal with rude customer reps. I wish I had read them before :-(", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product, excellent merchant", "Author": "Ecclesiastes", "ReviewID": "R16TEHVCDE7YDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was long hesitating on which camera to buy. The differences in the specs between 5D and 550D were subtle, differences between this model and considered higher level 40/50D were slightly more. Overall, for a beginner photographer, as I am, the camera appeared to be very good one, providing all that I was looking for - good control over the shooting setting, not bad optics (kit lens), good ccd size, nice metering and very good quality at high ISO levels. In my case video shooting was also important as we are expecting a baby. The tests went pretty well, both in still imaging and video. The only thing that I would perhaps note as negative is relatively long auto focus. In some cases it takes a while, so manual may be preferred choice.We had a pretty good deal with the merchant, the whole package, that included stand, cleaning kit, memory card, and a bag, appeared to be very competitive. We have received everything within the promised date, not even the last day of the timespan. Everything was in a very good condition.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "About the Product...", "Author": "hyun", "ReviewID": "R3E4AZUCEE8RG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Everything was included as it said. Good Camera but slightly heavier that I thought it would be.The 18-135mm Lens is good but it has its limits. Taking Close up shots are difficult. Might want to get a smaller lens if you are into close-ups.Also, The UV filter lens were used..............  It had multiple small scratches on it. So I had to buy a new one and its all good now.The SD card was actually class 10 so I was happy.Battery is good, case is good, cleaning kit is ok.. but smells with \"new\" factory smell which is kinda bothersome at first.Tripod is cheap stuff so its wobbly. But other then that, the camera and lens was a good purchase.I hope this review will be helpful to others.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best deal currently available", "Author": "xxatti", "ReviewID": "R19Y08AGZWRAS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewers, I bought this kit cause it was the same price as the 60D + 18-135mm kit. So if you're going to buy the 60D + lens, then you might as well get this kit and enjoy the free stuff that comes with it. I'm not gonna review the individual items in the kit (as others have already done that), but I'll simply add that it should be noted that the extra battery is not Canon brand; it's a Power2000. And the tripod isn't that bad. Sure, it's not the same build quality as top professional tripods, but it's pretty decent for a free tripod... even comes with it's own carry case.I highly recommend this kit for anyone who plans on buying the 60D with the kit lens.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm happy with this camera", "Author": "Alan S.

This kit is nice that you get the spare battery and the needed SD card and UV filter.  The camera works great except that the 1080P video doesn't live up to expectation. The playback is unacceptable but works fine in 720 mode, which is probably good enough for 99% of common need.  I  don't know if this is because of the SD card speed or not (Transcend class 6), canon needs to come clean on the requirement for taking true 1080p video.The 18-135 len is great, works for me on all occasions.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "grt kit... juz for same price as 60D + lens", "Author": "praba", "ReviewID": "R16HQ5AC8UB93D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is my 1st dslr, and i m glad of buying this kit. same price compared to 60D + lens alone. you can buy this kit n u wil be getting other stuffs as bonus!!!!!!!!!!. i tried shooting images n it was excellent.. sharp pictures , i really love the 16 GB class 6 memory card. var angle LCD is awesome, it is very effective in difficult angles. overall i m happy tat i purchased it on new year day n it is such an excellent deal i made.. bcoz  i m a beginner, i got enough accessories to take better photos.tripod - sturdy n gud for the price.memory card - excellantbattery - gud backupnice cleaning kitbag - pretty big!!.. has more slotsUV filter is intact with my lensoverall great purchase.. worth for your money.so will never hesitate to recommend this kit to my friends..", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,019.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 9 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS 60D Digital SLR Camera Body with EF-S 18-135mm IS Lens + <2> Transcend 16GB Class 6 SD Card +\n<3> Spare LP-E6 Battery + <4> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter +\n<5> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <6> Precision Design 57-In.
