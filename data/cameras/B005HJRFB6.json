BUT...the reason I only gave this 3 Stars was because it's made like Garbage ! The Clock is actually to freaking Heavy for the tiny Pins holding it to the Safe/Back portion. Actually, it was dangling off when it arrived, but I was able to slide the Pin back in with no problems. But I am still nervous every time I open the darn thing ! But I believe as long as you are careful and you are Not opening and closing the thing a hundred times a day....I am quite sure it will be OK. Like the old saying...You Get What You Pay For !  And the other thing I do Not like even More than the Pin Issue is that the Clock is freaking LOUD ! Tick-Tick-Tick-Tick-Tick....!  :-)  So believe it or not I left the Battery Out of the Clock !  :-)  Still looks like a Wall Clock except it's simply a Broken Wall Clock...!  But hey...it will do the Job I need it for. Not like I will be hiding very Valuables in there...kind of Mid Range stuff. But for $10-$12 Bucks, what the heck....it's doing the job !", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$27.99", "Features": "Hide valuables\nStash cash in a hidden spot\nFunctioning clock\nOutside dimensions are 10 inches by 10 inches by 3 inches thick\nThe inside dimensions of the safe are 8 1/2 inches x 8 1/2 inches x 1 7/8 inches", "Name": "Trademark Gambler's Wall Clock Diversion Safe", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513TFxQDcxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005HJRFB6"}}
