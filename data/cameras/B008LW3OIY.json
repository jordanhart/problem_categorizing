(basically camping with the school).  I thought it was a good idea because he could take more pictures than on a disposable one and I could enhance the pictures on the computer when he got home.  Needless to say I did not want to spend a lot of money in case he lost or broke the camera.  What I found was that the pictures are a horrible quality.  Very grainy and non-focused.  I adjusted the resolution to the highest possible and set the camera on auto focus and it did not come close to the quality of a simple disposable one.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "4x Digital zoom and SD card support\nDigital still camera mode and antishake and face detection features\nRechargeable lithium ion battery\nHigh definition camera", "Name": "Vivitar 16.1MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch TFT (VS137-BLK-BOX-ESP)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-dWTfUzuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008LW3OIY"}}
