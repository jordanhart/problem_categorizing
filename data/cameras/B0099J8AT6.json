Controls have good ergonomics, with a great slaughter. Are very precise in his actions, the main controls are very well located. The autofocus system is good, fairly quickly in most situations. At only 11 points, that I use for the sport mainly. Often, I use even less. For portrait photography, I use only the center point. High-sensitivity is excellent even at ISO800, ISO1600 has a good compromise in terms of overall quality, ISO3200 is always good for prints up to 20cmx25cm. Above and to ISO12800 disguises the difficulties, but it is a compromise; In this format, APS - C sensor, does not exist in any brand better in this regard, there are only equivalent products, or lowest products.I am very happy with the purchase I made, the Pentax finally found its best in the world of digital photography.I believe that there is a market for a zoom APS - C, a 23-69mm with an aperture constant f/2.8 (equivalent to a 35-105mm fulframe).It is not too much, just a zoom 3x. This would be perfect for photos of family, often made indoors.Your weak point is in the range of objectives, you must think and produce what others don't. Down your own path, the other brands that will be behind you, never the reverse.It is too expensive to produce with aperture f/2.8? OK, f/3.2 or f/3.5 at most.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Camera Rocks!", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R1RKMNT93GA59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, this camera is wonderful. I actually sold my Canon 60d and all of my lenses to switch to the Pentax system. I was so impressed by the hardware and the photos this camera can produce. When I pick up this camera, I feel truly inspired to make great photos.When buying a camera, you need to come to the understanding that you are buying a camera system. You need to approve of the lenses and their prices before you decide your camera body. For me, the real buying choice was the weather sealed lenses for a crop sensor body. In the Canon world, you won't find a standard 18-55mm lens that is weather sealed. And you definitely won't find one cheaper than $1000.00 (unless you consider the 17-40mm L which in my opinion is not that great for a crop camera.) Pentax however has a 18-55, 18-135, 50-200 all weather sealed and all less than $500.00. WOW!I find that Nikon and Canon both push the consumer to purchase their high end gear. This gear can be Thousands and Thousands of dollars. Unfortunately, my pocketbook isn't that big especially as a armature prosumer. The Pentax lens line up is very competitive. While there may not be as many choices, each lens is nothing short of Fantastic! Even the cheapo glass can take some amazing pictures. If you wan't to go to the next level, no problem... buy another lens that meets your goals. Maybe a 16-50 f2.8, or a 50-135 f2.8 or you can look at their amazing primes (note: not many of these are weather sealed).If you are a Pro and this is how you make your living, buy Nikon and Canon. If you are a hobbiest, prosumer, or simply on a budget and are looking for a professional grade camera look no further Pentax is your brand and the K-5 II will do you great.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "After years(40+) I have a PENTAX", "Author": "Don McAllister", "ReviewID": "R2CSOD2L7VFU8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always wanted a Pentax since high school.  Back then they where film cameras.  I know it can do way more than I need but....I really like the feel of it, I have large hands and it fits nicely, the wife has small hands and can work all the controls just fine, this is something we have had trouble with on other cameras.  Menus are straight forward and easy to move through. My early attempts at taking pictures have yielded fantastic results so the auto mode is great for newbies to DSLR's.  It may be more than a lot of beginners want to invest in at first, but I expect it to last a lifetime so a good investment.  There maybe cameras with more gadgets,speed, etc. but hey it's a PENTAX (IMO) the Harley of DSLR'S", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pentax K-5 II", "Author": "David Shentu", "ReviewID": "R3351FE8MIG7IX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase this camera to replaced my beloved K-r.
