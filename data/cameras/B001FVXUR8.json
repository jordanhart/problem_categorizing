The camera has some slight wear but thats it. Overall I like this camera alot. Does't take the best pictures though, however it's not a top notch professional camera either. I love the sliding lens cover to turn it on & the one touch movie record button. The camera does produce some nice quality photos when in good lighting conditions or outside. Also the flash can over expose some pictures, that I dont like. Other than that most pictures are clear, video is nice, & for the price that I paid, I think its worth it. I'm using it as a back up, because my sony cybershot broke, I must say it was a bit of a down grade. Can't wait until I get the fujifilm finepix z110!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Adara Garth", "ReviewID": "RJZG8CFA1HP5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera in blue, the cheaper color, at about 75$This camera is amazing at that price, the zoom works to a full potential and all the compartments for battery/memory and outlet to plug it to your computer are easily accessible without destroying your nails or pens.the flash has a the right intensity and the separate button to record video is nifty, The videos also look sharp at night with decent lighting. 2hrs of video are about 4G's of memory but it's well worth it for the price and comfort this little blue wonder provides. Sharp image, clear sound and automatic mode selection if you wish it to do so.I'm not a photographer, but for the sake of having a family camera, this Fuji takes the cake.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "J.
