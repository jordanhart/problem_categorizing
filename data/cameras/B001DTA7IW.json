{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DSC-T500 Is The Camera I've Been Waiting For!", "Author": "Michael J. Foley", "ReviewID": "R2I4CCI3E0D81E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've seen this coming.  The technology has been advancing so quickly that it was only the waiting that's been tough.  I bought this camera right away and am VERY pleased with it.  I just don't know where to start.This is both an excellent stand alone still camera with 10.1 MP, which provides enough details for 19 by 13\" prints. To my experienced eyes, the images are in a word superb. It is also a tiny HD camcorder with 720P and stereo sound!  It's not quite as good as a stand alone HD camcorder but with the ease of flicking a switch into the movie mode as well as the size of the camera, it is nothing short of astonishing.  I easily loaded both images as well as video clips into Windows Movie Maker and edited between the two and burned a DVD with excellent results.It certainly doesn't require it, but if you have a flat panel with an HDMI input, this camera really shines.All the settings (except for power, switch between image and movie and telephoto) are made by touching icons on the seemingly huge screen and is fairly easy to master.  Great care has been taken so that the camera's feature are easy to use.  This is my first camera with a touch screen and it is wonderful!  One of the camera's nicest features turns out to be the ability to take still photos while shooting video.  While editing, it's nice to be able to add a still image before or after the video clip. Especially when you fade into it.You'll need a bit of time on how to hold the camera.  At least with me, I kept getting fingers in front of the lens.  Your left hand need to hold the camera toward the bottom.  The camera is both light yet heavy enough that it feels good in your hands.My camera did not ship with a Memory Stick.  I just ordered a 16GB card for a little over a hundred dollars and according to the manual will hold 4001 10MP images or an amazing 3 hours and 17 minutes of video in the 720P Fine mode.  Video clips are limited to 10 minutes each and this may concern some but is more than enough for me.  I also ordered 2 extra batteries since the video especially seems to eat up power.  No case is included so you'll need that if you're interested.  Cables are included except for the HDMI cable.  The camera comes with a camera stand that you hook the cables to and then to your computer/television/receiver.  Viewing the photos and videos on the camera itself is a joy.There are too many bells and whistles that this camera offers to list here.  Check out the details listed on this site.  I will mention that the photos of the camera confused me and I found that there's a panel on the front of the camera that slides down and that turns the camera on.I've always owned Canon Powershot Digital Elps in the past and have really liked them.  But this new one from Sony is a sort of masterpiece.If I run into any problems with this camera, I will update this review.  If you have any questions, I'll be happy to try and answer them.UPDATE 10/17/08I ordered two off brand batteries from Accessory Genie, which are offered on the Amazon site, charged them up and installed them to find a screen saying something like USE COMPATIBLE BATTERY.  So, they are going back.  I ordered the genuine Sony batteries, which I really should have from the start.  The camera is just getting better and better as I use it.UPDATE 2 10/22/08I got the Sony battery, charged it up and installed it and it works perfectly.  So it was the off brand battery that was the problem.  With two batteries, unless you plan on taking a lot of video, should be fine for a day's shooting.  I want to take a bunch of video and photos in Vegas in mid Nov.  I might just add another Sony battery just in case.  I went for a walk today and took some video as well as photos, came home and loaded it into Windows Movie Maker and came up with a successful video that I then burned to disc and watched on my 52\" Sony XBR flatscreen.  Really very nice.  Not quite as good as my stand alone Canon HD camera, but the difference in camera size is considerable.  To think that this camera is storing video on a 16GB Memory Stick is truly amazing.  Over three hours of it!  I mentioned that you can take 3 still photos while shooting video with an icon on the lower left bottom of the screen, they are of a lower resolution.  Still makes acceptable 5 by 7\" prints but not nearly as good as the stand alone stills. When edited into the video mix they are 16 by 19 and look extremely close to the video images.I still am in love with this camera!UPDATE 3:  (12/24/08)Enjoying the camera.  Getting more accustomed to using the features. Been using the higher ISO setting for dark/night shots, which can be accessed by touching the REC Mode and then touching the SCN icon and then touching the ISO icon with the upward pointing arrow.  Learned that wherever you touch the screen, it will focus on that spot.  A very nice bonus. This feature works in the Auto and Program mode.  Just got back from Cape Cod, where I carried the camera with me everywhere.  Reviews are finally being posted on a few sites and they are good, except for the battery life.  Considering all that this camera does, that's not a really big deal.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Finally a camera worth upgrading for!", "Author": "Alex T. Ching \"Alex C.\"", "ReviewID": "R66RSPL7LLU62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been content with my Sony T7 until it died on me just recently. Every camera after the T7 just got bigger and bigger without adding any worthy features.I had a very difficult time deciding whether or not to go T77, or T700, or T500. In the end, I picked this one since I would always want the HD video feature and could live with the larger size.What prevents this from getting 5 stars are the following:- The camera is big and not exactly pocketable- No Bionz processor (both the T77 and T700 have this, and it seems odd the flagship camera does NOT). I'm curious as to how much this helps.- No smile shutter tech (annoying since this is also present in the T77 and T700)- Low res LCD - only 230k pixels versus 921k on the T700. why??- No built in 4GB memory - there's def enough room for one. why include on the T700 and not this one?- Interface is not that great, but I presume it's the same on the other two Sony cameras.- Hatch to open battery and memory compartment is a pain to open (was much easier on my T7)Why others may not like it, but that doesn't bother me:- Memory stick only - good for me since I have a Sony laptop I can plug these in right away.- Battery life gets sucked quickly from big LCD and video recording - to be expected for these types of cameras. Be frugal with leaving it on.Why it's a great camera:- HD recording is awesome (along with stereo and zooming while recording)- Big 3.5\" LCD- 5x optical zoom versus only 4x on the T77 and T700- Excellent build qualityIf you don't care about the HD video, the T77 and T700 are definitely the way to go.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony T500 - I think this one is a keeper!", "Author": "E. Goldblatt \"Clearsky\"", "ReviewID": "R3E9CRVGJFCRDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried just about EVERY point and shoot that takes HD Video, plus countless other digital cameras over the years. The HD P&S;'s I've tried are: Canon TX1, Panasonic TX5, several flash drive camcorders that also take still pic's, Sanyo HD1000 & HD700, Samsung HV24HD, and ALL the Kodak's that take HD Video. By the way - it's a good thing that the places I buy these cameras from have a good return policy or I would have been in big trouble. My wife thinks I'm obsessed; she's right!  Unfortunately, all of the above cameras had some serious issues - suffice it to say, not acceptable!My criterion is pretty simple, but not easy to find. All I really just want is a small point and shoot that takes decent wide screen (16:9) pictures and HD 720 or 1080 videos. Nothing pro - I'm reasonable - the pic'/vid's need to look decent, clear, not make me sea sick to watch on my HDTV, stay in focus, sound quality OK, able to zoom during video (and the sound not cut out - i.e. Samsung), and able to stick in my pocket. I don't care about millions of screen shot selections, smile detection, and all the other gimmicky things. My computers are all able to play the new video formats so playback is not a problem. Why is this so darn hard????? This is 2008 (almost 2009) - we should have flying cars by now - right!!! Sorry for the rant - it's just frustrating!Anyway, I think I found what I've been looking for - at least for now. This new Sony T500 basically does it all.I'll start with Video - all I can say is NICE. Even in dim rooms, they look pretty good - outside even better!  I have a media center computer hooked up to my HDTV - they really look nice and clear. Smooth playback. Zooming is nice and the video actually seems to stay in focus. Color is nice. Stereo sound quality is clear, stable to look at even while moving (no sea sickness with this one). What can I say - it just looks good - no major complaints. The video is, I think, the real strong point for the little camera.Now for the Pictures - I've taken some really stunning pictures. Clear, color balanced, sharp, zoom is nice. Outside/good lighting is great; inside in low light, a bit grainy - but not bad - definitely acceptable. You have to play with the settings to get good indoor pictures, again really not bad at all. Flash seems strong. Focus fast. Lag Time - no problem. Good Zoom. Simple and intuitive operation and options.Bottom line, my other favorite camera, the Canon G7, may take better stills, but this T500 takes solid still pictures and has FAR superior video, is much smaller, and easier to schlep around.My few grips (and it should be no deal breaker for anyone in my humble opinion) is:1) Battery life not so hot - I had to pick up two extra batteries - no big deal really, I just throw them in my pocket and when one dies out I just replace!2) Indoor pics are somewhat grainy and unpredictable. But all in all, I happy with the pictures. Just take several of the same indoor shots and one will be good for you.3) Memory Cards: as with many other camera geeks out there, I really wish Sony would just give the option of using SDHCs. I have so many SD cards (ranging from the old 16 mb SD to 16 GB SDHCs. Now I can't use them! Well - I just bought a new duo 8 GB - kinda costly, but \"Resistance is (was) Futile\" - I had no choice!That's about it - I really like this camera and will keep it - at least until the next Point and Shoot that looks \"to good to be true\" comes out!***** UPDATE *****OK - some of you are going to think I'm crazy, but I just had to try out the new Canon SX-10 (really wanted the SX-1 - but not in USA yet). Well, to my great surprise, I still like the Sony T500 better. I will admit that the pictures on the SX10 are better, but only slightly better for my needs. So the con's outweigh the pro's  - I'm keeping the Sony!1) The Sony take MUCH better video (wide-screen 720P) while the Canon only the 480. The Sony is much clearer, sharper, and looks great on the big screen. This is important for me anyway!2) Outdoor pictures are almost the same for both cameras (at least on my screen), and indoor are slightly better on the Canon, but not bad at all on the Sony. Canon is just a bit \"sharper\", but again, the Sony ain't bad! I do like the 20X zoom, but I guess that's just not as important for my needs.3) The physical size difference is a big factor for me - the Sony slips into my shirt pocket and and Canon is huge. I could live with the larger size if the pics/vids where FAR superior - but they are not and I think I would bring the Sony everywhere, as I might think twice about the Canon.4) Battery: The Sony takes rechargeable batteries (I now have three since they do not last long) and the Canon take 4 AA's. I kinda like the little Sony batteries better (although they just run out too fast), I can just throw my two extra's in my pocket and switch them out when needed. Otherwise, with the Canon, you would have to schlep around 4 large batteries if you run dry.All in all - I'm still happy with the Sony, so I'll keep it - FOR NOW!!! Stay tuned - I'm sure I'll be trying out other cameras soon! Got my eye on the Panasonic Z28!", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worth the purchase", "Author": "Kent \"macmedia\"", "ReviewID": "R2S57UIK3X56AI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The thing that drove me to this camera was the HD resolution for videos.  If it wasn't for this, I would have looked at others that were slightly smaller.  I had a Canon SD800 that I was replacing which was thicker but smaller.  I also have a Sony FX1 video camera too.After using it about a month, I have these observations.Having the HD resolution on a camera this small is nothing short of amazing.  I never want to go back to 320x240 or even 640x480 res vids.  Although it would NEVER compare even at the slightest to a dedicated HD camcorder or a my FX1, It's great to have the capability in your pocket.  I carry the T500 with me everywhere and it's better to have the shot than not having at all - no one wants to lug a camcorder everywhere around.Compared to other subcompacts (I've owned over 15 the past 8 years or so), the low light capability is the best out of all of them.  There is some graininess in very low light but with my canon, you wouldn't be able to even get a picture in comparison.I personally prefer real button controls.  The touch screen is initially nice but to get to the submenus takes a while to get used to and there are frequent repressing the icons to get something to come up.  The touchscreen is sometimes finicky - or perhaps a lag.The extra large LCD is very nice - but be sure to buy a screen protector BEFORE buying the camera.  I put a permanent smudge in the screen within 1 hr of receiving it.  I thought I was careful but now I can't get the smudge off.The battery life is horrendous.  Whereas the canon can probably last me 2-3 weeks of occasional use, I have to charge this every couple of days.  450 photos/videos in one month and I believe I have had to charge this at least 8 times.  This is with mixed photo taking and video viewing - similar to what I did with the canon.  Be sure to have a couple of extra batteries when traveling.I bought a SanDisk Extreme III 8gb HG Duo stick and it was definitely well worth it.  Previously, I was using an Extreme II with the canon and the significant transfer speed upgrade is welcomed when transferring the really large videos from the T500.  I don't have specifics but it feels almost twice as fast.Being able to use the zoom (optically) while shooting video is a big plus.  With the canon, my vids gets distorted.  I have a full 5x zoom which is excellent for a camera of this size.  Also, because the lens position is fixed (sony has their optics inside the camera), it is much smaller.  Don't have to worry about the lens popping in and out.The optical stabilizer works but on a limited scale.  I feel the Canon has better stabilizing as my videos are still a little bit shaky.Overall, the photo quality is pretty good.  I like the canon picture quality in good light but with a mix of both low and good light, the Sony is much better.  I have no regrets about buying this over a new Canon. On a side note, I also bought a Sony T77 with this camera (I'm a camera hog).  The T77 has the same quality but no HD.  However, it is significantly smaller and a little bit lighter than the T500.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good features, poor battery", "Author": "E. King", "ReviewID": "R3TSUFN8VK9HWL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera primarily for its ability to record 720 video in a small form factor.I've never owned a digital camera, but thought that it was finally time to stop relying on my girlfriend to take photos. Living in San Francisco, having quick access to a camera is vital and a small slim factor is key.I bought this camera mindful of the caveat that its battery life is terrible, so I ordered an extra battery. I was pleasantly surprised to find a battery charger bundled with the camera. Even two fully charged batteries, however, wasn't enough energy for a trip to the California Academy of Sciences for 3-4 hours. Perhaps 20 minutes of HD video--total--and 300 photos completely drained both batteries. Flash was rarely used, to make the limitations of the battery even more dramatic.I enjoy the camera and the video quality, but this battery life is absolutely terrible. If I was to go on a day trip, there would be no way 2 batteries would be enough. The supplied battery charger takes 2 hours to recharge each battery, as well. Needless to say, a time consuming process for 3+ batteries.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent performer in a small package", "Author": "Jason Stanley \"sixgill\"", "ReviewID": "R29V6WJFAW5UGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We just put the new T500 through its paces during the arrival of our new baby. Both still shots and HD video taken with the camera came out beautifully. Camera performance is excellent. The touch screen controls are intuitive, the options are plenty (if you want to bother with them), and the quality of the output is great.The only reasons I'm not giving the camera at 5/5 is that the battery seems to get dragged down rather quickly (admittedly mostly due to video usage), and the included docking station is required to plug the camera into your Mac (or PC). As I travel a fair bit, and like the small size of the camera, it's a bit of a shame that a docking station is needed, in addition to the USB cable (would be optimal if you could plug straight into the camera and avoid the extra hardware).One last point to note is that this camera is the better choice if you want video and still photo capability in one. If you're looking for a camera that can store a ton of still pics on board, without requiring the not included Memory Stick Duo cards, then go with the T700 model.All in all, this is a solid camera, with a great output, in a perfect size. Definitely can't go wrong.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Hybrid Video/Digital Camera is here with the Sony T500", "Author": "BZAM", "ReviewID": "R3AMN1GC1OJLFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I, like many, have been searching for a device that successfully combines the camera with the camcorder.  We have an older point and shoot Sony camera, and a Canon MiniDV Camcorder and I've noticed over the last year the camcorder has been spending more time left at home, while the number of short clips from the still camera was growing.The new Sony T500 was delivered last week and it's exceeding many of my expectations.  The large touch screen on the back allows the design to be simple and intuitive.  I thought I would miss control buttons on the back, but don't.  There are smaller form factors out there, but the T500 easily fits in a pocket and is definitely on the sleek and compact side of things. Camera feels solid and well built.HD Video Recording:Simply toggle the switch to the right and you're in movie mode.  Outdoor shooting in good light produces some very impressive video.  Displayed on a flat screen, I'd have to say this little camera easily out performs my non HD camcorder.  Low light shooting was not as sharp and a camcorder probably does better in low light.  That said, I would still not hesitate in buying this camera.  Zoom during video moves at one speed (unlike a camcorder where you can control the speed that you zoom in and out), but it's a good, moderately slow speed. Audio is crisp and clean.Shooting video may take a little getting used to.  Because the T500 is so much smaller and lighter then a camcorder, extra thought must go into keeping the camera still and keeping your motions smooth during panning.  I haven't come close to the 10 minute video limit.  I know some will argue you need unlimited shooting time for weddings, birthdays, etc.  but when I put movies together with iMovie, I've found that any clips over a couple minutes make the movie REALLY boring.  For those special occasions, I have no problem lugging around my camcorder, but for daily life and times you don't want to shove a camcorder in people's faces, the Sony T500 excels.Still Photos:Like video recording, outdoor and good lighting produce some beautiful photos.  Indoor and low light are not as good but I've found the \"Twilight Portrait\" scene mode produces some decent photos.  We primarily view our photos on a flat screen, and the 16:9 picture mode is great for landscapes and scenery shots.  Even though it's not an Ultra Wide 28mm lens, the wide angle is still wider then our previous camera (3-4 year old Sony).  Sure a larger zoom would be nice, but considering the slim design, 5X is pretty good, and you better have a tripod if you're shooting video above 5-10X.  Not surprisingly, the still camera is a noticeable upgrade to our old 5 mega pixel camera.Battery life does seem a little short, but I've been shooting a lot of video and spending a lot of time reviewing on the large touchscreen.  Definitely need a back up, and I like the US version of the battery charger.  Prongs fold out and you simply plug it in the wall (No Cord Mess).Overall, I'm very satisfied with our purchase.  The video and photo quality are impressive.  I'm not quite sure I'm ready to sell off the camcorder, but I know it will be spending even more time stored at home...", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "T500 = Great Deal", "Author": "David E.

Fotos are also very good.Since this is such a High-end Camera, I'll talk about the bad stuff first.Video and Foto quality on low light conditios are low. You can easily see artifacts and low pixelation on indoor shoot like a wedding even with 10 MP and Fine quality HD Video.Also, you cant shoot at standard 480p resolution like your old camcorder. its Either HD or VGA, and for video shots you want to conserve Memory space there is no DVD resolution available. Even with my 4Gb Memory Stick Pro-HG Duo, which is the fastest memory on the market, the camera would be slow to react on pictures, specially when using Flash. I casually miss pictures because the camera is slow to react or take long time to take the picture after you press the shoot botton till the end.Other than this,  Camera is great, small and High-Powered. .mp4 format for HD video is great and widely used on the industry and social networks recognize it as HD right away.There is absolutely a sacrifice on the Photo side for allowing HD Video, so if you dont shoot videos, go for the T-77 or the Newer T700 for a Slim size option or the W series for better quality picture.On the other hand, if you at least casually Shoot Videos, then absolutely get this camera, you will find yourself shooting more videos than pictures.On memory, go at least 4GB, gives you around 2hrs on Fine quality and I recommend the Pro-HG version to keep the camera as lag free as possible.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Truly Amazing Camera", "Author": "L.

The still image quality is perfect, and the camera just looks and feels so awesome. You can tell Sony put a lot of effort into the design and didn't cut corners anywhere.The most impressive feature of this camera is HD video recording. The quality of the recorded video blows away my non-HD camcorder that I bought just a few months ago. It's amazing that such a tiny digital camera can provide such amazing HD video.

Paul", "ReviewID": "R2XZTN713VIH6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera recently from Amazon as an alternative to the slow in coming Samsung HZ10W and have really been amazed by what it can do!About the size of a deck of cards, the Sony T-500's big selling point to me was the availability of stereo HD (720p) Video in MP4 format, something extremely scarce in any digital camera to date.  This was my second attempt to get a compact HD shooter - the first was a Kodak Z1275 that seriously disappointed with its choppy video that was jumpy and would actually shift the entire picture to follow moving objects due to a lack of IS.  Thus, I was quite skeptical of getting usable results from a camera that looked like a chic hipster tagalong.My skepticism has been silenced.  The MP4 results are very stabilized, very clean, and play with pretty good fluidity on my somewhat under-powered box.  When zooming in outdoor situations, it has never lost focus.  Stereo separation is really pretty good, and overall sound quality is excellent.  The compact size is very discreet and makes it a great option when you want to shoot video with a more candid feel.  In short, it is amazing.Yes, this is a camera as well, and I've used it a bit in that regard as well, though not as much as the video feature.  Overall, colors are very punchy (somewhat too punchy in the VIVID mode) and you may find the need to notch up the exposure by .3 to .6 stops (an available option) to keep from muting out shadow details.  Other than EV compensation, there is no real manual exposure control when taking photos.  There is a bracketing mode if you're shooting still lifes though.  Once the novelty of the video feature wears off a bit, I'm sure I'll do more stills and report back.The camera has a whole lot going for it, but perfect it isn't.  Read on for some of its limitations.First of all, keep in mind that this is ideally an outdoor camera, as it doesn't have the fastest lens. I have yet to attempt dusk or night shots or video, but certainly will in time.If you plan on taking the camera travelling or out for a day, you will almost certainly need to budget for at least one backup battery before buying this camera, as it likes to drink juice thanks in part to the huge 3.5\" touchscreen on the back.  You'll discover this is NOT the camera to pass around to show all your friends the last shot or clip you all took - if you do, you'll find yourself soon looking at a dead battery.  This is probably the biggest shortcoming about the camera, but if you can be patient about reviewing your shots and conservative about having the camera on unneccessarily, you should be ok.  It does go from off to ready VERY quickly, so this does help combat the need to keep it on at all times.The 5X zoom covers roughly a 38-190mm equivalent on a 35mm range, so it should be good for most settings, but some may wish for wider or longer options.  Also, when stowing the camera in a waistcase, it's easy to mistakenly switch from video setting to camera setting, so this should probably be the first thing to check when taking the camera out.Overall, the camera feels sturdily constructed and with just decent TLC, should provide the purchaser with years of enjoyment.  The form factor on this camera is really nice, and is only nicer when one considers that it has the function to match.Four out of Five Stars with the only drawbacks being battery life, and the general nuissance of the need to use propietary media and power supplies.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incredible camera!", "Author": "Gary H.

I purchased and then gave this T500 away, because I was not happy with the larger size and the image quality of both indoor and outdoor images.  Images which seem to be, less impressive than the 8MP T100 I had. I use Sony Vaio notebooks and love most Sony products, but Sony digital cameras, just don't perform well, compared to Canon. Sony always wins, when it comes to the style and looks, of their camera's (compact cameras) but the same can't be said, when it comes to the look of Sony images.After owning the T100 and T300 and giving them away, along with all of their extra batteries and Memory Sticks, I was sure I'd be staying away from Sony Camera's..... Then came along a new HD compact shooter that caught my attention unlike the other HD compacts (image quality of the Samsung HD compacts is very poor). The HD video was my only reason, for giving Cybershot's another try and yes the HD video is pretty nice.However, I'm not as impressed, as many who are new to HD shooting are. I shoot a lot of HD on a Canon Vixia HF11. The canon is small for a camcorder but not able to fit in any normal human size pockets (perhaps a large jacket pocket). Having HD in your pocket is nice but it came down to one question for me: Would I rather have the best still images in my pocket or the best video in my pocket (as of now, nobody can give you both)? My answer, led me to the Canon SD990, and I am in love with this little (smaller than the T500) camera. And FINALLY Canon gives us the option, of having a nice black finish. If still images matter to you most of all; then take pictures with the T500 and SD990, both indoors and outdoors and view them on your PC screen, side by side and you'll see what I saw. Now when Canon comes out with HD like Sony, but with Canons better image quality, I'll be in line for that. BTW' another question I asked myself was how often do I ever shoot video from any compact I've ever owned? The answer was very little. And Like I mentioned, HD video is common for me so I suspect that for anyone new to HD video shooting, that after a short while, the novelty of shooting HD video from a compact shooter, will wear thin and still images will become the dominate choice in which having the best still image shooter, will be desired.Also you will want to keep in mind that all that you've read about the low battery life is true. I couldn't't believe how quickly a fully charged battery ran down while shooting video and then also pretty quickly while just taking shots (I'm talking about less than 30min Arnold :-) ). The T300 was pretty bad with power consumption, but the T500 has only gotten MUCH worse.In the journey of our lives, it's very nice to be able to capture moments, and in the long run, it will have worked out best, to have been able to capture those moments, in as high resolution as possible and for now, the SD990 offers that in compact form, better than anyone else (still images only of course).Below I've cut and pasted, a pretty detailed review of the T500, from Cnet Asia. Hope I'm not breaking any Amazon/copyright rules here. I hope my review, has been of help to some of you out there. Now hurry up and get yourself, a new camera for the holidays.AshtonThis story was printed from CNET Asia.--------------------------------------------------------------Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T500By Leonard GohSep 03, 2008URL: [...]Sony's latest Cyber-shot offering, the DSC-T500, is certainly keeping up with recent compact camera trends by incorporating HD-quality (1,280 x 720-pixel) movie capture. Sweetening this deal further is the integrated stereo audio recording, a feature found only on one other shooter to date, the Samsung NV24HD. Sony is targeting the T500 at hip, young, working adults, but our guess is that HD video capture will probably appeal more to the tech-savvy crowd. However, image quality left much to be desired, especially after seeing what the Cyber-shot DSC-T77 can deliver.DesignThe exterior of the Cyber-shot DSC-T500 looks typical of Sony's T-series shooters. There's the front sliding cover, clean button layout on the top, and as with its touchscreen-enabled point-and-shoots, the rear is clutter-free. However, we found some clever modifications made to this snapper.Compared with the T77(bottom), the T500(top) is much thicker.(click for larger image)To allow users to change between shooting and video capture mode easily, Sony has implemented a switch around the shutter button which makes toggling between modes really simple. Surrounding this switch is the zoom collar which is positioned where our forefinger had easy access to.Despite all these features which appear to make one-handed operation an intuitive task, we had to use our other hand to navigate the menus and change settings because the icons are scattered on both sides of the screen. This is not so much of a problem as a matter of personal preference.Unlike the typical T-series shooters, we would not consider the T500 slim and light. Rather, it feels relatively substantial in our hands. The heft and weight are something we noticed immediately when we picked up the shooter, but since its target audience is the more tech-savvy crowd, we guess they wouldn't mind the slight bulk.FeaturesThe 10.1-megapixel T500 is Sony's venture into HD-quality video capture on a point-and-shoot. So naturally, this was one of the aspects we tested heavily on. The clip we recorded under daylight was pretty detailed and we were quite impressed. But as with most conventional compact shooters, we noticed there was a fair bit of noise dotting the clip in low-light conditions.Audio-wise, the T500 supports stereo recording. The sonic pickup was one of the best we had tested in a point-and-shoot, and we could really hear the different sounds captured on both channels. To spice it up, the speaker on the Sony also provides stereo playback. It was certainly loud enough that playing it on the bus raised a few eyebrows.Packed into the T500 is a 5x optical zoom lens, stereo microphone and speakers.(click for larger image)Unlike other HD video capture-enabled snappers which record in AVI format, Sony has opted for MPEG-4 instead. A 35-second recording on the T500 chalked up about 42MB which we found to be small, compared to the 30-second, 100MB clip on Samsung's NV24HD.While recording clips, it was nice that we were able to zoom in and out, but the shooter didn't focus on several instances when we zoomed in on our subject. But we liked how the T500 was able to snap high-resolution still images while recording video.The rear estate is taken up mostly by a 3.5-inch touchscreen LCD. We found its response to be acceptable. We think this is because the icons are larger and makes for more accurate tapping. For more precise focusing on off-center subjects, we just had to tap on the screen and a box would appear to indicate the shooter's focus.One feature we were amazed at is the 5x optical zoom that the T500 provides without protruding the lens. However, it lacks a wide-angle lens. If not it will be pitting against the NV24HD which has 24mm ultra-wide-angle optics. We also noted that an optical image stabilizer is used on the Sony rather than sensor-shift IS which the company has always employed in its point-and-shoots. This worked equally well, and we didn't detect any difference between the two IS systems.The optical image stabilizer worked well for this picture, which was taken at 1/20 second.(click for larger image)For slightly more advanced users, adjustments to the flash output, color mode and exposure compensation can be made to achieve different looks and feels for the snaps.An exclusion that Sony has made for this point-and-shoot would be the BIONZ image-processing engine. We found this to be rather odd because the company has always included this in its digital cameras, and we speculate that it could be due to the HD movie-recording function that requires a different chip for it to operate smoothly. With the lack of the BIONZ engine, the D-Range Optimizer feature has been removed, too. We will look at how this affects the image quality in the later part of the review.There is 50MB of onboard memory in the T500, and you can buff it up with a Memory Stick PRO Duo flash card if you want to snap more shots or record longer video clips. A lithium-ion battery provides power to operate the point-and-shoot.PerformanceThe timings that the T500 clocked in our tests were typical of how other point-and-shoots perform. Startup time was a hair less than 2 seconds, while shutter lag measured approximately 0.1 second. The time-to-first-shot was inconsistent though, because it tended to focus faster when faced with a landscape scene than with macro subjects. However, most compact point-and-shoots have the same problem.For trigger-happy folks, the rated battery life of 180 shots may be a deal-breaker. In our tests, we managed to take about 100 shots, several HD movie clips and lots of tinkering around with the touchscreen before the battery went flat. This means the T500 may not really be suitable for holiday goers as the battery could be drained before the day is over.Image QualityAn ISO comparison table of the various ISO sensitivities on the T500.(click for larger image)Earlier on, we mentioned about Sony not having the BIONZ image-processing engine and D-Range Optimizer in the T500. It appears that without these two components, the image quality did suffer slightly. We did a quick comparison with some images taken with the Cyber-shot DSC-T77, and found the quality of pictures captured at ISO 400 favored the latter. Not only were more details retained, the noise-suppression algorithm was more efficient in cleaning up the image, too. For the T500, the picture was a tad too gritty for our liking, and details in certain areas were smeared.However, the quality of pictures taken at ISO 80 to 200 was still acceptable. Noise reduction handled well, although it was clear that at ISO 200, details were smeared. At ISO 800, the images were not very sharp and, needless to say, at ISO 1,600 and 3,200, we could barely make out words in the test chart.Image comparison of the T77 and the T500 at similar settings.(click for larger image)Another noteworthy point would be that the T500 tended to produce saturated colors, which in some cases appeared a bit unnatural. Also, there were tendencies to underexpose the picture but that was easily solved by manually compensating the exposure.We liked how we could manipulate the flash output to achieve more natural-looking skin tones in portraits. In most cases, night portraits were nicely lit and backgrounds were exposed for, too.ConclusionAlthough the T500 has a swanky HD video-recording function, it seems the lack of the BIONZ engine has an impact on the image quaity. But a redeeming factor for the shooter would be the large 3.5-inch touchscreen LCD and the onboard stereo microphone and speaker. It didn't make us an instant Spielberg, but we really like how the recordings showed more details and the stereo playback adds extra punch to the clip. Would we pay S$799 for this point-and-shoot? Well, we have to admit there are better options out there, such as the NV24HD which comes with an ultra-wide-angle lens that we really fancy. But if you like the looks and style of the T500 and don't mind taking pictures at only low ISO settings, the little premium should be worth it.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "DSC-T500", "Author": "Patrick J.

Although even though this camera's video quality probably isn't as good as the kodak zi8, for me it's a better balance of still picture features and HD recording. If you take lengthy videos I would absolutely go for the kodak zi8, i think that has hours and hours of recording while this is sub 1 hour.On the Cons, this camera really does have bad battery life, you'd probably have to be very concious to turn it off when not actively using it. Also I don't like that fact that it's so dependant on the included dock that connects via usb to your computer. I wish it AT LEAST charged the camera while plugged into the computer, but if you plugged it in and accidentally left it there for an hourish you would have to charge it for 3 hours again.It also has poor low light video and picture processing, making the pictures look grainy and doesn't do real life color tone justice.Conclusion:Overall I think people critique this camera too harshly being that it was like around $400 or something retail when it was first released and I think people have forgotten that it's now dipped to around $250. It really isn't as bad as a camera as some reviewers make it seem. This is a great camera but performance can be shifty, so if you want a more reliabaly consistant performance still picture camera, look to the sony w290, if you want something for HD recording, get the kodak zi8, if you want common ground and will sacrifice sometimes inconsistant low light performance, GET THIS CAMERAor just chalk out 100 more for the t900 or t9 and most of the cons will be fixed", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camcorder, Terrible Camera", "Author": "Paul M.

Although, we do not use point and shoot cameras for our business we do use them day to day and on vacation because we hate carrying the big boys around.I have been a long time user of Canon cameras (both professional and point and shoot) and I have always been extremely pleased with them.  However, my wife and I wanted a small camera that could take some high def video because we presumed that would give us better video quality.  We also wanted a camera that you could optical zoom while recording video.When we bought this camera 4 months ago, there were not any Canon point and shoots with high def video so we bought this Sony.  I have always been a big fan of Sony consumer electronics and recommend them to my friends all the time.  However, I am very disappointed with the DSC-T500 for the following reasons:1.)  Though the video is \"high def\" the quality is almost always poorer than what we get out of our old Canon which takes standard def.  Now, if you are taking a video outside with good lighting conditions, this camera does an awesome job and the high def quality is great to have.  However, when inside or if lighting is not perfect than the video you receive is very poor because it is grainy and the coloring is always off.  Everything looks very red when videoed inside.2.)  The picture quality is WAY below that of my Canons.  The flash is always too strong and washes out anything within 6 feet of the camera.  However, if the subject is more than 15 feet away the flash is too weak and cannot lighten them up at all.3.)  The camera is slower to take a picture than my Canons.  Also, the refresh rate on the flash is miserably slow.  If you take a picture with a flash you will definitely be waiting at least 3-5 seconds before it is ready to take another.  When trying to photograph my children, that is an eternity.4.)  The battery life is abysmal.  We had to take three batteries for this camera on our recent trip because it would always go through at least 2 every day.  My Canons never did anything even remotely like this.  You can literally watch the battery meter fall while recording a video.  I haven't seen a digital camera go through batteries like this in over 7 years.I definitely would NOT recommend this camera to anyone.  The only feature this camera fulfilled that we wanted is that it can optically zoom while recording and does a fine job with that.

This renders the T500 useless under flash conditions, which is a deal-breaker for me.So back it went.  Hopefully the Sony designers can fix this fatal flaw with their ultra-compact cameras.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best camer", "Author": "Humaid A.

Just opened and charged it. Just one test pic. Disappointed that there's no smile shutter or good in camera retouching features like the t77 or my h50. not a bog deal but that smile shutter is fun. also a little bigger than I hoped and the docking station's a bit of a pain but guess it's needed bc of the hdmi connection. will test it for a few days and see how it goes before final decision.QUICK UPDATEtook it with me on dog walk so far impressions good. a little heavier than I'd like but it's borderline. Pictures on sunny day auto setting are GREAT! no idea how it will perform in adverse conditions (low light etc) but on a clear day it's sharp, bright, nice color balance. Love it.Hi-def: took a couple quick vids and while nowhere near as good as a stand alone camcorder it absolutely BLOW AWAY the quality of an analog vid from my H50. check them both on lcd tv and the t500 just blew away the h50.still not sure if I'll keep the thing but hope any of this helps.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Alexander Cruz \"Cruzito\"", "ReviewID": "R1HY4TAC3HI226", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not that much into digital cameras and I only had a few in the last years.

Unfortunately, the picture quality was way below any digital camera I have ever owned or used. I was advised to send to the Sony Repair Center which I did. It was returned and the pictures were still of low quality. It appears that perhaps there was a defect in the lens, the sensor, or the programming. However, my main complaint turns out to be the lack of service by Sony Customer Service and Customer Relations. My calls have not been logged properly, I have been hung up on, and I have spent countless hours on hold and being switched from one department to another. I am very disappointed in every aspect of this purchase. I don't know what else to say beyond the fact that I am totally frustrated and might as well chalk up the $400 as a total loss.

You are about to purchase it because you want to take PHOTOS so you can print them or view them on your computer screen. That is the main function of a camera - photo making.The quality of pictures that this camera produces is substandard. Period.Do not be fooled by the touchscreen, the 5x optical zoom or the Sony brand. The picture quality is horrible. Period.Another reason I would avoid buying this camera (as if the 1st reason is not enough) is that Sony cameras use their own \"memory stick\" which unlike the standard cards which other brands use cannot be used directly with your laptop or desktop computer, you will always need to use either their docking system or an adapter.
