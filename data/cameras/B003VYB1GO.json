The pictures come out too Grainy when I use the SR Auto setting or the regular Auto setting.  It's supposed to be a point and shoot camera, but I find myself using the program mode and adjusting the ISO and white balance to get an ok shot under regular lighting.

Cox \"silver surfer and listener\"", "ReviewID": "R1H6DC3IWZUADL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed with this camera.1) As there is no view finder I find it very difficult to 'view' through the screen on a bright, sunny day. It's virtually black.2) As mentioned before, the battery does not hold a charge for long.  I need three batteries, one on charge, one in the camera and one ready charged to use when required.  I was told that these batteries were 'environmentally friendly' and lasted a lot longer than ordinary ones. Rubbish!!3) I had about 35 good shots on the camera, which I hadn't downloaded onto my PC. More fool I.  I thought I should correct the time on the camera, very easy to do, I might say, and..... lo and behold,  all photos completely lost. Not once did a warning come up that I might lose photos if I changed the time.  I have tried removing the memory card and putting it through a card reader - nothing.  I am so angry and disappointed as the shots were particularly important.4) Beware when using video that all other shots may be lost.5) As with other reviews, quality is pretty grainy.I do NOT recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Jx280", "Author": "Pops", "ReviewID": "R3JWS3WVJXFCL4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera on Sep 16 2010, Charge battery took a few pictures and thebattery went dead, recharged battery and the next day went to take pictures and the battery was dead again, went and bought another battery, and it does the same thing, will not hold a charge.

Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2057H9GFW7S9I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This would have been a 1 star review if it was based on photo quality alone. I have to admit I hadn't used this camera on a sunny day. But on a cloudy day outdoors with natural light, or indoors with artificial light I only got 1 good photo out of the 100 pics I took, before I returned it to the shop. I've got two other Fujis from previous generations - a 3MP and a 6MP and I was extremely happy with the photos from both of them. When I saw the specs of this camera I thought, well if it's a Fuji with those specs it's bound to be a winner. Sadly I couldn't get a good photo no matter what I did. I tried all the auto modes, then various white balances, scene modes, flash modes and even resolutions - no joy. The pictures lacked colour (very flat); lacked clarity (my 6mp produced pics with more detail); the processing was all wrong - oversharpened to the max; and the white balance was all wrong - on auto it was never the right white balance (mostly too yellow), and on manual I had to choose the cloudy day setting for most indoor shots.I only tested shots on people, because this is when you want a camera to really perform well. Every subject, even in potrait mode looked just so pale, the skin tones had no life at all. Skin blemishes were amplified, making the person actually look worse than they do in real life - sometimes bad quality cameras actually mask skin blemishes, but this camera amplifies them!The extra star was for the video - very nice picture, but only during the day. Evening videos, even with half decent artificial lighting, were very grainy. The sound quality in the videos is excellent. It's also great being able to use the optical zoom while filming, however the sound is muted while the zoom is operating. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this camera. It's possible that a firmware update could save it, but only if the hardware is actually capable of producing better results.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$142.95", "Features": "14-megapixel resolution; Fujinon 5x wide-angle zoom (28mm-140mm equivalent)\nHD Movie at 720p with sound; 2.7-inch High Resolution LCD\nHigh Sensitivity ISO 3200; Tracking Auto Focus\nSR Auto Automatic Scene Recognition; Motion Panorama mode with Auto Stitch\nCapture images and video to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix JX280 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dn0tDekPL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003VYB1GO"}}
