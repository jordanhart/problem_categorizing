Well that was a mistake. On that camera the pic quality and features were very sub-par. Do not waste your time on that camera. I felt bad that I made a bad choice on her camera so I looked around a decided for a couple more dollars I could get her a \"grown-up\" camera. I went with this one and I am very well pleased by it all. The camera is made out of plastic but the features and picture quality outshine the previous camera. Much easier to use. Of course for the price you only get the standard features like flash, no flash, timer and zoom. For a secondary camera this would be a good choice. My niece is so much more pleased with this camera as well. I even took some pictures and the quality for this camera were great for a 5mp. Plus the screen is a good size. I am glad I got this camera.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fair cost value", "Author": "German", "ReviewID": "RGDC2BZJ8ZUYT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I  bought  this  camera  for  my  6  years  old  son  and  the  best  is  the  image  quality .

Its light weight, easy to operate, easy to handle! Not exactly what i thought it was going to be but it'll work for now, considering the fact that it doesn't seem very durable. I bought this brand new and when i pulled it out of the package, it sounded like something was loose inside the camera. I Found out that a 1GB memory card only takes about 15 minutes of video. I suggest a 3GB or higher for longer videos. Also, it doesn't seem to play the audio until it gets on the computer. It takes a while to adjust the image to where its not blurry. This particular camera comes with the cord and two AA batteries already inside the package. I'm sure adjustment can be made when you upload pictures and video. Just buy some rechargeable batteries and a 3GB+ memory card. I expected better but like i said, its a great camera....for now!", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointing.", "Author": "rebeccamt", "ReviewID": "RLG1EKEEPZ6VU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Simply not as expected.

Granted I think I paid $40 or less but wish I'd spent $60 for something better. She actually has taken some good pics but this was very disappointing. Features for a cheap camera are fine, def portable, not hard to use but terrible picture quality on any setting.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Should be easier to use", "Author": "Mare99", "ReviewID": "R30SU134BA88JI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my sister, looking for a simple starter camera. When I tried to demonstrate how to install the batteries and to take photos, I found it much more difficult to use than I expected. Each time I fumbled with a feature, I could feel my sister shy away from trying it herself. The product listing should tell you to buy at least one SD card, as the memory is too small to take more than 3 photos without it. I suppose you get what you pay for, and it might not be a bad camera for someone who has used one before, but it is not a good choice for someone who has never used one and has digital phobia.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5.0 megapixel resolution, 4x digital zoom and 2.7-inch bright color TFT LCD for previewing images before you shoot\nTakes video clips with audio\nPolaroid PoGo Compatibile\nUses 2 AA batteries", "Name": "Polaroid a530 5.0 MP Digital Camera with 2.7 Inch LCD Display (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NHF7b2HSL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0025VKVJW"}}
