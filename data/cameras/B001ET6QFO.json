{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Detailed Review of the Canon 50D -  I love this Camera!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Jodi-Ann Richards", "ReviewID": "R1R183ILECWRGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SECTION 1: WHO IS THIS REVIEW FORThis review is close to 10 pages long because it was written for people who are not proficient with the terms and concepts used in the DSLR world. If you are a proficient DSLR user then I would recommend that you check one of the much shorter reviews here or dpreview. For example, you already know what vignetting is and therefore understand the importance of the new lens peripheral illumination correction feature. However, a new DSLR buyer does not know what this means and this is why I therefore explain what each feature really is so these people can then decide if the feature is really important to them.If you have not done so as yet, be sure to also check out my reviews of the Canon 7D and Canon 40D as well.SECTION 2: INTRODUCTIONIt has been just over a year now since I purchased my Canon 40D. At the time, I was just beginning to take my photography really serious. Since then, a lot has changed. I have now become a semi-pro. I still have my full-time job as an IT Manager here in Miami. However, I do a lot of photography work, especially events, on the weekends.I really love my 40D but as I started doing more and more professional work I realized three things:1. I needed a second camera body2. I needed a camera with a more professional focusing system.3. I needed a camera with even higher ISO performance It was rumored back then that the replacement for the Canon 5D would be out in the first quarter of 2008. I decided to wait for it. However, when the time came there was no news from Canon about the 5D replacement. This was back in March 2008. The Nikon D300 had now been out for a while by then. I thought about buying it but I decided to wait until it was fully reviewed by dpreview as I wanted to see if Nikon had really finally addressed the high ISO performance issues. I ordered it one day after it was reviewed by Phil Askey on dpreview.Since then, I have been using both the Canon 40D and the Nikon D300. I know it is a bit of a strange combo. People are always surprised when they see that I am using a Canon and a Nikon together.I took all three cameras - Canon 40D, Canon 50D and Nikon D300 -  over the weekend to the Miami Seaquarium to see how the new Canon 50D compared with both of them.SECTION 3: NEW/CHANGED FEATURESA.  High-resolution LCD ScreenThe LCD screen is still 3 inches. However, Canon has now increased the resolution from 230,000 dots to 920,000 dots which is the same as that found on the Nikon D300. Of course, this makes it a lot easier to check images on playback to see if they are sharp and in focus. More important, however, is the fact that Canon added a two layer anti-reflective coating which makes it way easier now to review images in bright sunlight. It is a lot easier to review images on the Nikon D300 than the Canon 40D. However, the Canon 50D definitely surpasses the Nikon D300 when reviewing images in bright sunlight.B. 15.1 Megapixel CMOS SensorI think the MP increase is the biggest surprise to me since Canon has always been conservative when it comes to this. However, this increase now seems to be the trend as the new Canon EOS 5D Mark II has gone from 12 MP to a whopping 21 MP. I was always puzzled by the fact that the baby Canon Rebel had more MP than its big brother.I can clearly see the difference in the resolution of the images produced by the 15.1 MP Canon 50D and those from the 10 MP Canon 40D. For a casual shooter this is not a big deal. However, for professionals shooting events this is really useful. Whenever I shoot an event I try not to turn it into a photo shoot. People are there to have fun. That is the first priority. I need to be able to get my shots fast. Many times this means getting the shot and then doing some cropping to make it perfect. Having 15 MP to play with can be a life savior here. Of course, if I only did portraits where I have time to pose my subjects this would be less important to me.There is a small difference in the resolution of the images from the 15.1 MP Canon 50D and the 12.1MP Nikon D300.C. High ISO PerformanceThe ISO setting control how sensitive the image sensor is to light. As the light gets lower you can increase the ISO to avoid using the flash. This is really important when you want to shoot in available natural light such as at dusk or at dawn when the light is really beautiful. Another example is when you want to photograph a bride and groom during the first dance without using the flash so you capture all the romance. The downside to increasing the ISO is that the resulting photos will tend to get grainier as the ISO increase.The Canon 40D allowed me to go to ISO 1600 and then expand it to ISO 3200. When I just started out doing casual shots this was okay. However, I find that I often needed to go higher than 1600 and of course I was forced to use ISO 3200. On the Nikon D300 I could go all the way up to ISO 3200 standard so if I needed to use anything higher than ISO 1600 I would use the Nikon D300. That way if I only needed ISO 2000 I could use that setting rather than use ISO 3200. I must let you know that Nikon did fix the high ISO performance issues that plagued its DSLRs prior to the Nikon D300.The Canon 50D now comes with a standard range of ISO 100 to 3200 just like the Nikon D300. However, the concern that I had was that with the big increase in MP count there would be much more noise (grain) at the higher ISOs. The more MP you have the more noise you tend to get at higher ISOs. I would have much preferred a smaller MP count and better high ISO performance. However, the engineers at Canon have really outdone themselves this time. The high ISO performance of the Canon 50D is just as good as the Nikon D300 even though it has 3MP more. Much of this is due to the fact that Canon is now using gapless micro lenses on the image sensor. This seemed to have really increased the light gathering capabilities of the pixels.The Canon 50D ISO can be expanded to 6400 (H1) and 12800 (H2). The Nikon D300 can only be expanded up to 6400. However, on the Nikon D300 you can go from 3200 to H0.3 and then to H0.7 before you get to H1.0 which is 6400. This is more flexible than having to go straight to 6400 since you should generally try to use lower ISO speeds.You might be thinking that it is absurd that anyone should want to use ISO 6400 and worse ISO 12800. However, there are times when getting the shot is more important than the quality of the shot itself. A good example here is when shooting sports. If the light becomes very bad for whatever reason you will need to increase your ISO as much as possible to get high enough shutter speeds to freeze the action.D. Auto ISO Range (100 to 1600)I have been to Butterfly World on several occasions to get photos of butterflies, birds and the tropical plants there. It is normally very sunny so to save time I shoot in Aperture priority mode. This allows me to simply set the aperture and then let the camera automatically set the shutter speed based on the current ISO and aperture settings. One thing about South Florida is that one minute it can be very sunny and then in just a few minutes it can become real cloudy. The problem this pose is that when it becomes real cloudy the shutter speed selected by the camera can be so low that it would result in camera shake which in turn results in blurry images. When I just started out my photography this actually happened to me as I would simply forget to check the shutter speed that was selected by the camera.The auto ISO feature lets the camera automatically change the ISO to suit the shooting mode. For example, when in aperture priority mode if the camera detects that the shutter speed selected would result in camera shake it automatically increases the ISO. This feature is available on the Canon 40D. However, the maximum ISO it would automatically set is 800. The Canon 50D will now set ISO up to 1600 which is a lot more flexible.The Nikon D300 actually takes the auto ISO concept further by allowing you to set the maximum ISO you want the camera to set and the minimum shutter speed you are willing to work with before the camera start to automatically set the ISO. This gives ultimate control to the photographer.E. Burst BufferAnother concern I had with the big increase in MP count was the impact it would have on the burst rate. With the MP count going from 10 to 15 this would normally result in a much slower burst rate. However, the new DIGIC IV image processor is a lot faster than the previous DIGIC III processor so the burst rate is pretty much the same at 6.3 frames per second from 6.5 frames per second. If you use a UDMA card with the Canon 50D you can buffer up to close to 90 large/fine JPEGs versus the 75 on the Canon 40D. The Nikon D300 can store up to 100 large/normal JPEGs at a burst rate of 6 frames per second. With the optional MB-D10 batter pack you can get 8 frames per second.F. Lens Peripheral Illumination CorrectionIt is just a fact of life that the light entering a lens tends to fall off around the edges. This tends to be more pronounced when the lens is wide open. The resulting photo will appear dark around the edges. You will see it sometimes referred to as Vignetting. It is more common on cheaper lenses. However, even the most venerable and expensive lenses are not immune to this problem. I have sometimes seen it on my professional grade lenses such as the Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 L IS lens and even the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 G lens.If you have Photoshop CS3 you can quickly correct this problem. However, that is still one more thing that you have to worry about which increases your workflow. The Canon 50D has a database of 26 lenses that it will automatically correct Vignetting for. In addition you can enter another 14 models. This feature can be a really big time saver when you have many photos that were shot with the lens wide open. An example of this would be a photo shoot in natural low light where you have to shoot with the lens wide open most of the times. I remember one such shoot that I did with both the Canon 40D and Nikon D300. When I returned home I had to sit there and review each photo in Photoshop CS3 for Vignetting and fix the ones that I found. This is despite the fact that I had used two professional grade lenses for the photo shoot.This correction works with JPEG as well as RAW images.Note that this feature is turned off by default. The reason is that Canon has no idea whether the lens that you are using will work with this feature. Even when you activate it you have to check to make certain that you see \"Correction Data Available\" which confirms that it does work with your lens. If not you can add your lens to one of the available 14.The Nikon D300 does not offer Vignetting correction but it does offer chromatic aberration (CA) correction which is not on the Canon 50D. CA is the colored fringes that you sometimes see in photos. The colored fringe normally happens along some edge in the photo where there is strong contrast. A good example is a photo of a white house with green trees in the background. The edge where the green trees meet the white house in the image is a good candidate for some kind of color fringing. Once again, this is something that can be corrected in Photoshop CS3 but anything that can be done by the camera will save a lot of time in post processing.G. Live View FunctionalityIf there was one feature that I really missed from back when I had my Canon S5 IS point-and-shoot camera it was face detection. It's a feature that people always asked me about since the Canon 40D and Nikon D300 both had live view but no face detection.  When I use live view on the Canon 40D and Nikon D300 I normally focus manually so I can zoom in on the face and then tweak the focus to make sure that it is as sharp as possible. With the 50D I can now save some time by using the new Face Detect live view mode. I also tried it with groups of people and it is pretty good at detecting the faces there as well.The refresh rate for live view on the Canon 40D/50D is 30 frames per second which is twice that on the Nikon D300 and even the Nikon D3. This makes the Canons better if you want to pan in live view.One of the biggest advantages of shooting digital is the ability to review a shot immediately to make certain it is good. Because the LCD monitor is just 3 inches, most photographers doing professional work also zoom in to check the focus and sharpness of the photo. You cannot simply look at the brightness of the image on the LCD monitor and assume that the exposure was good. For example, if you are in a dark room and take a photo, when you view it on the LCD monitor it will look very bright but that is because you are in a dark room. The exposure might not be really good and it is possible that the photo is actually underexposed.When you are doing critical work the best way to review a photo is to view the associated histogram. This is nothing more than a grayscale graph of the tonal values in the photo. An ideal histogram is shaped like a dumb-bell or like a wave that goes up and then down. It goes from black (shadows) on the left and gradually to white (highlights) on the right. A quick check is to see if any of these are clipped (cutoff). If the highlights are clipped it means that something in the photo was overexposed. If the shadows are clipped it means that something was underexposed. If most of the values are to the left (shadows) it generally means that the photo is underexposed. If most of the values are to the right (highlights) it generally means that the photo is overexposed. The Canon 50D has a live view histogram. This is something that is somehow missing from the Nikon D300.WARNING: If you are coming from a point-and-shoot (P & S) background it is important to understand that live view on a DSLR is different from what you are accustomed to.(1) The first thing you need to be aware of is that live view is really suitable for still subjects that do not move. A good example of this is if you want to a portrait of your kids where you can get them to stay still. On the other hand, it is not suitable for taking action shots such as your kids playing or of their dance performances. For these action shots you should start out using the sports automatic mode which is for action photography when you don't know how to set your own shooting parameters.(2) Live View is only available in the creative modes. If you want to use it and you are a beginner you will have to put the camera in Program (P) mode. This is one of the creative modes but the camera set everything for you so you don't have to worry about setting anything. The only thing you will have to remember is to lift up the flash when it is needed.(3) To use auto focus you will have to press the AF-ON button. You can focus manually the usual way.H. Quick Control ScreenOne feature that I really have enjoyed using on the Canon 40D is to use the LCD screen to set my shooting parameters such as ISO and drive mode. However, I had to push the info button twice for the screen to appear and I still had to use the buttons on the top of the camera. The Canon 50D has improved on this concept. Now all I have to do is push the multi-controller straight down to get into what is now called the Quick Control Screen where the shooting parameters are displayed on the LCD screen. Also, I can now use the multi-controller to simply select any shooting function and the use the quick-control dial to change its settings. Of course, this is a lot easier than having to make selections by pushing different buttons on the top of the camera.The Nikon D300 has the same kind of functionality here as the Canon 40D. However, the user interface is a lot friendlier on the Canon as the names of all the icons are also displayed as well. Remember that the Nikon D300 is targeted at more advanced shooters so it does not bother with showing the names of icons. It does not even come with any automatic modes like the Canons.I. Creative Auto ModeWhen you use the Full Auto mode the camera controls just about everything. You cannot even decide whether you want to use the flash or use continuous shooting. The Canon 50D no longer has a C3 mode dial. It has a new Creative Auto (CA) mode dial. When you use this mode dial the Creative Auto screen comes up on the LCD monitor. The settings start out just as if you were shooting in full auto mode. However, you can use the multi-controller to select and make changes to any of the following: flash firing, picture brightness, picture style, image-recording quality. You can also decide whether you want to use single, continuous or self-timer shooting.There is one special change that you can make here that needs special mention. You have probably seen some beautiful portraits where the background is beautifully blurred. This not only makes the subject stands out but also gives the portrait an overall artistic look. The only problem is that you have to be able to set your own aperture to achieve this effect. The Canon 50D has now changed all that. When you are in CA mode, you now have a graphic slider on the Creative Auto screen that you can drag one way to blur the background more and drag it the other way to make the background sharper. There is absolutely no need for you to have any idea about aperture and depth-of-field. You can now produce portraits with beautiful backgrounds (bokeh) simply by dragging a slider!Since the Nikon D300 is targeted at advanced shooters you won't find something like this on it. It is assumed that if you are buying a camera like that, that you already know how to set your own aperture and shutter speed etc.J. High ISO Noise ReductionEarlier on I told you that as you start using really high ISOs you will start noticing more and more grains (noise) in the photos. Cameras like the Canon 40D, Canon 50D and Nikon D300 all offer a custom setting which allows you to specify whether you want the camera to reduce high ISO noise. You might be wondering why the camera does not simply always try to reduce high ISO noise. Well, there is a trade-off involved here. As you try to reduce the noise you will lose some of the details. If you are taking a photograph and you need to preserve details even at the expense of some noise you can simply chose to turn off high ISO noise reduction. If it is more important to get a clean photograph even though you might lose some of the details then you should turn high ISO noise reduction on. One major drawback of using high ISO noise reduction is that it greatly reduces the burst rate. This is another reason why it is turned off by default.The Canon 40D offers just 2 settings here - on and off. The Canon 50D allows 4 settings - standard, low, strong and disable. This gives you much more flexibility as you can chose to use a low setting rather than just an on setting which is the equivalent of strong.The Nikon D300 also has 4 settings which are pretty much the same as those on the Canon 50D even though they are named slightly different.K. Micro AF Adjustment of LensesStarting with the Canon 40D, Canon started trickling down some of features from the professional 1D Mark III DSLR. One feature that did not make it down to the Canon 40D is the ability to fine-tune the AF on your lenses. This advance feature is now on the Canon 50D. You can chose to adjust all lenses by the same amount or you can actually adjust up to 20 lenses individually.This feature is also on the Nikon D300.L. HDMI OutputOne of the biggest advantages of shooting digital is that you can review your shots right away as well as show them to your clients or friends right there if you have a display unit that you can hook your camera up to. Of course the craze these days is HD. Everything just seems to look better in HD. There was no HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) output on the Canon 40D so you could not do a slideshow on a HDTV. With the 50D you can now do that. You can now take some really cool photos of your kids and view them right there on your HD television which makes a huge difference from viewing them on a non-HD display.The Nikon D300 has this feature.M. Auto Lighting OptimizerWhen you photograph a scene that is evenly lit your camera does a very good job of setting a proper exposure to ensure that your main subject comes out bright enough. However, if the scene contains high contrast areas of brightness and darkness it can trick the camera and cause your main subject to come looking really dark. For example, if you try to photograph your friend with the sun behind him you will most likely find that your friend comes out looking really dark. This is because the bright light from the sun in the background tricks the camera into believing that there is more light on your main subject than there really is.The auto lighting optimizer feature enables the camera to better handle these kinds of scenarios by lightening the dark areas in a scene such as your friend while still keeping the details in the bright areas such as the sun in the background. This feature was not on the Canon 40D but it was added to the Canon Rebel XSi which came after it. With the Canon 50D you now get this feature but with 4 settings rather than just the enable and disable settings found on the Canon Rebel XSi. You can choose from standard, low, strong or disable.This feature is on the Nikon D300 with similar 4 settings.N. New sRAWThere is a new extra small raw file format. With the 50D you now have the option of shooting RAW files at 3.8MP, 7.1MP and of course the whopping 15.1MP.O. That Darn Print ButtonI don't know what is it about that darn print button that Canon just refuses to get rid of it. Yes, it is still there on the Canon 50D. However, this time you can use it as a shortcut to live view. This is a welcome change over the Canon 40D. On that camera I had to store a short cut to live view in the My Menu tab. Now with the Canon 50D I can turn live view on and off by simply pressing the print button.P. New Function ButtonThe jump button is still there but its functionality has changed. It is now a function button that you can decide which of the following menu items you want it to activate: LCD Brightness, Image Quality, Exposure Compensation/AEB Setting, Image Jump and Live View Settings. Based on your current shooting scenario you can decide which one of these you want to appear when you press the Function button. For example, at Miami Seaquarium I assigned the LCD Brightness menu to it. This is because the lighting varies greatly from one place to another so I had to keep adjusting the LCD Brightness constantly to review the photos. Instead of having to go through the menu each time it was really convenient to simply press the function button and have the LCD Brightness menu appear - great time saver.SECTION 4: Is this the right camera for you?Your buying decision should be based on your requirements, budget and personal preferences.It is very tempting when comparing the 50D to the 40D to get carried away with the 5MP difference. However, you really need to consider the type of work that you will be doing and the maximum print size that you expect to do. Here is a summary of the maximum print sizes for different megapixels (resolution):6 megapixels 8\" * 10\"8 megapixels 11\" * 14\"10 megapixels 13\" * 19\"As you can see if your maximum print size is 8\" * 10\" then you are covered with even a 6 megapixels camera. You should really have a very good reason for needing more than the 10MP found on the Canon 40D.Here is what you should do. Check off the new/changed features that you think you will need based on where you would like your photography to start and be in a couple of years. If these new/changed features are not really important to you then go with the Canon 40D. You will save yourself some money that you can then use towards buying a good lens. For example, assume that you have $2,000 to spend on both the camera and lens and you are just interested in getting great shots of your children playing soccer and of their dance performances. In that case I would recommend that you get the Canon 40D body ($955) plus the Canon EF 24-105mm L IS lens ($1,040). It is really important to get a good lens. It is better to have a good L lens on a Canon 40D rather than a mediocre lens on the Canon 50D. On the other hand, if you know you want to do strong professional work and you definitely want a Canon then I can highly recommend the Canon 50D with its new/changed more advanced features. You will not be disappointed with this camera. So far I have found it to live up to everything that it promises. I am really blown away by the fact that Canon could really pack so many MP into that sensor and still give great high ISO performance on par with that of the Canon 40D and Nikon D300.The decision between the Canon 50D and the Nikon D300 is a little bit trickier. Last year when I purchased the Canon 40D, the body was going for $1,299. This means that Canon has only added $100 to make the price $1,399 for the Canon 50D. When the Nikon D300 launched last year, the body was going for $1,799. This difference in price plus the fact that there are still many features on the Nikon D300 that are not on the Canon 50D, tell me that Canon is still not trying to compete directly with the Nikon D300. This is reinforced by the fact that Canon has now even added a Creative Auto mode which is for beginners. In my opinion Canon is trying to provide a DSLR that can be used by both beginners and even professionals depending on the type of work that they do. This is all done at a very reasonable price. The problem that I see right now is that the price of the Nikon D300 is now at $1,550 which means that for just $150 more you can get a much more advanced camera. Two of those key features are the whopping 51-AF focus points versus the 9 on the Canon 50D as well as 100% coverage in the viewfinder versus 95%. You have to decide if the higher resolution, higher ISO performance and a better live view on the Canon 50D are more important to you. If so, then you should go with it. If not, you should go with the Nikon D300. However, be prepared to spend a lot of time learning because there are no automatic modes on that camera. Another important point to consider is the availability and prices of the lenses you will need. Canon lenses are readily available and are also cheaper than their Nikon equivalent. Shortly after I purchased my Canon 40D I simply went on Amazon and bought a Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS lens. After I purchased my Nikon D300 I had to wait several months before I could get my hands on the Nikon equivalent of that lens. It is constantly back-ordered. When I finally got it I had to pay $300 more than the regular price. I own 5 Canon L lenses and I had no problem getting them - they were all ordered right here on Amazon.SECTION 4: ConclusionYour camera should make you feel invincible when out in the field. The Canon 50D is a robust and capable camera that produces stunning images even at very high ISOs. However, it is really up to you to decide whether this is the camera that is best for you based on your personal requirements, budget and preferences. Whether you decide to go with this camera or the Canon 40D or the Nikon D300 I can promise you that you will not be disappointed.You can check out photos from the Canon 40D and Nikon D300 on my website at tajdigistudios. As I do shoots with the Canon 50D you will see photos from it as well. Be sure to check under the Portfolio menu item. If you are new to DSLRs you might want to check out my free course at tajdslrcourse. If you are considering the Canon 40D you should also check out my review of it right here on Amazon.10/25/2008: I have uploaded three (3) photos of butterflies to the Customer Image Gallery here. The image quality is simply amazing. I really love this camera!!!!!11/2/2008: The dpreview of the Canon 50D came out a few days ago. I have added a comment to discuss my thoughts on this. If you have found this review helpful, I recommend that you take a look at my comment to consider some of the negatives from that review. I ran out of space here.11/23/2008: Softness IssueIn my original review I mentioned that you need a good lens with this camera. I want to stress it again because I have seen reports of softness which is as a result of the high resolution showing up the flaws of the lens being used. Several reviews have made this clear but it seems that people have not paid much attention to it so I am adding the references to this important requirement for getting the best results from the Canon 50D.Dpreview actually pointed it out but not in a very clear way when the reviewer said: \"At a pixel density of 4.5 MP/cm2 ... the lens becomes the limiting factor\".Digital Camera Review makes it much clearer what the issue is: \"If anything, the extreme resolution of the new image sensor makes the lenses a potential weak link in terms of overall image quality.\" They continue: \"Even stopped down, many budget lenses may produce soft images that lacks punch and crisp details, making it all the more important to pay attention to the glass you're using.\". And finally: \"Bottom line, there's not much to criticize about the image sensor in terms of image quality, so the right glass will make the biggest difference.\"Camera Labs puts it like this: \"Perhaps the biggest issue facing the EOS 50D though is its high resolution. Canon's use of gapless micro-lenses may have kept noise levels under control, but the high pixel density places greater demands on optics than ever before. We found the new EF-S 18-200mm IS lens, while highly flexible in terms of composition, just wasn't able to exploit the maximum resolution from the EOS 50D. If you want to make the most of the 50D's resolving power, you'll really need to couple it with decent lenses - in terms of a general purpose option, the EF 24-105mm f4.0L would be more appropriate.\"Finally, from imaging-resource here is one of the cons: \"Soft images with the 28-135mm kit lens; demands very good optics\"FOR BEST RESULTS, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD A GOOD LENS WITH IT!I have seen some comments here by others that the Canon 50D is lacking IQ and could be Canon's Vista. They claim that this view is supported by dpreview and imaging-resource. I am a bit surprised by this since both dpreview and imaging-resource both highly recommend this camera.Here is what imaging-resource had to say: \"So while the 40D is great, and will remain in the market, the Canon 50D incorporates plenty of enhancements worth the couple-hundred extra bucks. The Canon 50D is an excellent digital SLR.\" Here is the final verdict from imaging-resource: \"Excellent low-light performance, impressive printed output, very fast shutter lag times, solid build, superb customization, and excellent image quality all add up to make the Canon EOS 50D a great choice for all types of photographers, and a sure Dave's Pick.\"At least both imaging-resource and cnet agrees that the Canon 50D delivers better results than the 40D at ISO 1600 and 3200. Their findings show that the higher resolution delivers extra sharpness without showing significantly more noise.[...]When people make these negative claims make sure you actually go and check the professional reviews that they are supposedly referencing.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "50D HD video and Magic Lantern Guide", "Author": "DOBrien \"Reviewing stuff...\"", "ReviewID":

As I was looking to buy one or the other at the time it was very important to me to see if these noise issues were in fact true or just caused by external factors.  Lucky for me a good friend has a 40D and a local camera shop was nice enough to let us borrow their 50D to snap a few comparison shots.  My friend and I took shot after shot using identical settings and identical lenses under a variety of situations, (low light, high speed, high light, inside, outside, dull colors and vibrant colors).  We then took the pictures, compiled them on a single memory card and displayed them on my 46\" 1080P HDTV.  Results were very much in favor of the 50D.  Shot for shot the 50D either matched or exceeded the picture quality of the 40D in all but one situation: indoors with low light and dull colors.  Under that situation the 50D seemed to noise out on the constant color areas, (beige walls for example), while the 40D tended to noise out at the interface between colors, (at the boundary of a beige wall and darm crown molding for example).  Both developed noise but the 50D had more.Overall though I was very impressed with the performance of the 50D.  It picked up a lot of details that the 40D didn't even come close to getting, (thanks to the 15.1MP sensor no doubt), was much better able to capture high-speed action in daylight and only produced noisy images under very particular situations.I purchased the 50D.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Debating Between a Canon 50D and a Nikon D90? Read This!", "Author": "C. Tan", "ReviewID": "R2GF6RKVOJ81QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before you read this review, please note that the Canon 50D and D90 are not in the same class and are targeted at different markets, but there are still many people, including myself, comparing them with each other due to the relatively small difference in price.  The Canon 50D should be compared to the Nikon D300, but since the D300 is clearly a better camera, there is no point. The 50D is in fact, somewhere in between the D90 and D300.  With that being said, I hope you find my review helpful.I spent a lot of time researching and comparing the Canon 50D with the Nikon D90.  I picked the 50D.  I hope my information here can help some of you out there making the same comparisons.First of all, I highly suggest that you go to a local store and actually hold both cameras, play with them and get a feel for them.  You will notice right away that the D90 feels cheap and is just made of plastic.  The 50D, on the other hand, is made of magnesium-alloy and feels  sturdy. It actually feels like a high-end camera.  The 50D is also weather-sealed, unlike the D90.  Build quality is extremely important, so keep that in mind. I also found the menus and button locations to be more user-friendly than the Nikon's.I read a countless reviews on the 50D and D90.  Most D90 reviews were pretty consistent with each other.  The D90 is a great camera that provides excellent image quality, can take 720p videos and is $300 less than the 50D.  The 50D review were also pretty consistent with each other.  The 50D is not much of an improvement over the 40D, the increase to 15.1MP resulted in a small increase in image quality and resulted in more noise at higher ISO settings, it cannot take videos and is $300 more than the D90.From a value standpoint, the D90 is a better camera.  It's a few hundred bucks cheaper than the 50D and can take videos.  That's pretty much where the comparisons end.  Here's why.1. The D90 isn't even a direct competitor of the 50D.  The D90 is aimed toward the consumer market while the 50D is aimed toward the prosumer market.  However, I still couldn't resist comparing the two, since the D300 was out of my budget.2. Video Mode - Nikon released the D90 with a sub par video recording feature.  It maxes out at 720p and does not, I repeat, DOES NOT have auto-focus.  From my experience with the D90's video mode, the combination of holding the camera with one hand while focusing with the other and walking around resulted in, well, bad videos. If you want to take videos, get the Canon T1i.3. Performance - The 50D, as with other prosumer level cameras, uses CF cards while the the D90, as with other consumer level cameras, uses SD cards.  CF cards offer higher capacities, but more importantly, faster speeds.  The 50D is capable of taking 6.3 frames per second in continuous shot mode while the D90 is capable of taking 4.5 frames per second.  That's with JPEGs.  Try continuous shooting with the D90 in RAW mode, and it will just beg you to stop.  The D90 just isn't made for high speed photography.  It's made for taking pictures when you are out on vacation with the family.  The 50D, on the other hand, was designed for high speed photography, such as sports and and capturing moving objects.4. Image Quality - Both cameras offer excellent image quality.  It has been said in several reviews that the 50D produces noise at higher ISO settings than the D90 and even the Canon 40D.  The reason for this is the higher MP count combined with the small size of the APS-C sensor along with the low quality of the lenses that were used in the reviews.  If you plan on buying the 50D, PLEASE invest in a good lens to take advantage of the camera's increased pixel count.  Had better lenses been used in reviews, the 50D would have received even better reviews.  The 50D is not a consumer/enthusiast level camera, so why use cheap lenses to review it?5. Live View - Wow, Live View is a sweet feature in DSLR camera.  If you have an important shot to take, Live View can help you immensely!  The 50D and D90 both have Live View.  The D90 only has one auto-focus mode in Live View, which is Contrast Detect.  The 50D has Phase Detect and Contrast Detect.  The D90 can only zoom in 6.7x, while the 50D can zoom in 10x.  Why is this important?  The more you can zoom in, the more precisely you can dial in the focus.  In addition, the 50D also offers micro focus adjustment to really dial in the focus.  The D90's Live View is adequate for the average casual user, but it's completely unacceptable to a higher end user.  The 50D's Live View feature caters to a more demanding photographer.6. Value - The D90 is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 50D.  It has features that attract the average consumer, such a video.  It produces great images worthy of a prosumer level camera, but lacks the feature and flexibility that a prosumer level camera offers, such as better build quality, better ergonomics, faster continuous shooting, full featured Live View and better tweakability. If these features are not important to you, get the D90.  However, as you improve your photography skills and start to photograph a wider variety of scenarios, you will find yourself wanting the additional features that the 50D offers.The question you should be asking yourself is - What do I want to do with the camera?  Do you need a camera like the 50D, or do you see yourself needing its additional features down the road?  The 50D might be too much camera for many people.  For that reason, I highly recommend the casual user to get the D90.  For you real photographers out there, get the Canon 50D.  You will not miss the video feature, trust me.  If you really want a Nikon, get the D300 (which does not have video either).", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but still VERY Outstanding!", "Author": "T. Semarge", "ReviewID": "R1LQPIJAWDZGJY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my hands on a 50D for exactly two days, and have taken only a few more than 100 photos; however, it is clear to me that this is no \"40D Mark II.\"  It is a giant step-up from the 40D and, in my opinion, akin to a jump between the 20D and 40D (the 30D skipped intentionally).  I can speak and write confidently of this because I own or have owned all four cameras. I have the 50D with EF 18-200mm IS Telephoto Lens, which came as an offered kit. Additionally, I own and have used the 50D with an EF 24-105mm f4L and EF 85mm f1.8.  Here is my two day take:  a.  Controls are familiar yet more intuitive than the 40D;  b.  Photos are top shelf.  \"Incredible!,\" \"Beautiful!,\" and \"Wow!\" are superlatives which came quickly to me and to my close friends.  I tried a few photos at higher ISOs.  Those photos showed a bit of `noise,' however, was much less than expected.  Noise at low and mid-range ISOs was not visible to me.  I took many pictures in shaded areas to see if this camera handles colors, tones, and lighting better than the disappointing manner of the 40D.  Seems to be truth to the claim of improvement in that area.  Not a Nikon D2, but still quite excellent.  I did not do any flash photography.  c.  The LCD is bright, sharp, and much more viewable in sunlight than its predecessor.  I think it matches well with those on the Nikons, which seems to have been one major objective with this camera.  d.  The camera body is solid; feeling to me even more so than the 40D.  e.  The 18-200mm IS lens was quite nice, and provides a great \"one-lens\" option.  I have not compared photos taken with it to those taken with the EF 24-105mm L-series; however, I believe in L-series lenses and would guess the 18-200mm will not hold a candle to the L's.  That said, it is a very excellent lens!!  My only criticism is the significant differences in focusing `speed' between it and the 24-105mm L lens.  It is Slooooooow...  The bottom-line is that 50D is a very excellent and, potentially, a very outstanding camera.  Not perfect by any means, but a great step forward.  I have not to date exercised enough of it's' features and options to be more specific now, but I will follow-up with more information once I have the opportunity to use the camera more.  I rated it a conservative \"4 stars,\" which for me is a high rating.FYI, I am an advanced amateur photographer.  I have much experience with Canon SLRs dating back to the A-1, and with some Nikons, including the D300.  I have remained a Canon enthusiast because of the investment I have in EF lenses, and because Canon, sooner or later, always seems to come to the dance with superb equipment.", "Date": "October 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Check reviews before purchasing; I prefer the 40D", "Author": "kyle", "ReviewID": "R2BIGXH2WFEA92", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used the 40D for a year, purchased the 50D based on positive user reviews here and at other online merchants, but as soon as I started taking photos with the 50D I noticed it had more noise and was softer than the 40D. Within a few days, people and review sites started posting comparisons and they all showed the same.  Many people are raving about the 50D's greatness, but the photos tell a different story.The 50D does have a much better LCD, does handle colors slightly better, but has more noise in photos than the 40D at ISO400 and up, as well as softer images. Taking softness and noise into consideration, you're not getting the clarity you should with 15mp, when compared to the 40D's 10mp. Even when downsizing photos to a smaller, web-sized image, more noise artifacts were visible in the 50D. Since I mostly shoot concert photography, I did not feel this was a worthwhile upgrade, so I returned the 50D and purchased another 40D.If you shoot outside or in bright light you'll have better use of the 50D, but I don't think you're getting a great use of those 15mp. The 5D is 12mp and produces sharper images than the 50D - yes, it has a larger, better sensor - but my point is to show how you're not quite getting the most out of the 15mp on the 50D. You're paying for 15mp, but how useful are they? If the 50D were 12mp, then producing sharper images with less noise than the 40D, I would have found that to be a worthy upgrade. The battery also drains faster in the 50D because of the LCD upgrade, if you use LCD much.While the 50D may be great for some, I'll wait to see what's next.  I highly recommend getting the 40D instead; save money, get better lenses, upgrade later (hopefully the next xxD) and shame on Canon.  Their claims of the 50D having less noise must have been based on its blotchy in-camera noise reduction quality and the more aggressive default settings of DPP's (Canon's Digital Photo Professional software) noise reduction as well.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price and features!", "Author": "K. DeVitto \"Ceit\"", "ReviewID": "R3OQF416INL6U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my new Canon 50D. I have to say that I am in love with this camera, no, it's not perfect. I would have loved to see a full frame CMOS sensor, but I can't have everything and price too! I find the images to be crisp and clear and the operation easy to use. I have shot over 300 pictures with this camera so far and I am very happy with the quality of images, especially at the high ISOs. I also gave it to a novice photographer to use on Thanksgiving and they loved it as well and had no problem operating the cameraA couple of nitpicks - First, on the new CA mode, I completely understand the need for this setting, there are many people picking up these cameras who have never used an SLR before and don't understand aperture or shutter speed. However, this feature is only as good as the lens.  If someone is using a lens that doesn't have an aperture of 2.8 or 1.4 then they won't get the background to be too blurred.  Second, the exposure compensation is now on the rear dial, this is more a preference and I will most likely get use to it, in time :).ETA: Another thing that would have been nice is a video setting like the 5D and the Nikon D90. But again, you can't have everything.One of the most impressive things to me was how it handles low light situations. I shot at the full range of ISOs and liked how the camera handled color, sharpness, and tone.  I see many reviews saying that Nikon or other cameras hold up better in low light, that might be so, but that doesn't make the 50D horrible or bad, it makes it different. I don't suspect that people are taking low light pictures at the ISO setting 3200 or even 1600 all the time, if they are, then I might recommend a lens change, something is wrong.And just a note -- to add light on the whole sensor/processor thing- look at it from this prospective film photographers will be disappointed because this camera wouldn't be able to compare against Kodachrome 25 ISO where you don't see grain at all or to the big bold grain of the Konica 3200 ISO - Nor can it fully replicate the Kodak/Konica infrared film where exposure was a best guess.  So, in other words you can't please everyone.  So choosing a camera body is like choosing film in the old days, each has their own uniqueness about it, but unlike film, you can't change easily.I consider myself a photographer having been shooting for well over 25 years, and have basically shot everything from 8X10 cameras to Polaroid Land Cameras (pull apart). I have used Holgas to Hasselblads. I have had access to some type of Digital Camera since Kodak came out with the Digital Nikon F3  with a top resolution was 1.3mp. I remembered when Kodak dropped the price of their pro-digital cameras from 25,000 to 10,000 that was something!Well a big woopie do for me, so, I have been around.  The reason why I am telling you all this, is not to impress you, but hopefully you will listen to some advice. I wasn't only a photographer but I sold high-end equipment. In the end you have to feel comfortable with whatever you buy, and you have to ask yourself what are the pros and cons of my purchase, can I afford it, and what do I want to do with my equipment?  These are all personal reasons and one persons reasons are as valid as anyone else's reasons.One thing about Photography that I learned early on, learn the basics. Learning basic photography before you buy the big wiz bang camera may help you understand what you want to do with the big wiz bang or that you might not need the biggest or bestest wiz bang thingy.A camera is only good as its lens, and with Digital you really have to *marry* both lens and camera. The one pitfall that I see people make is that they buy too much camera and not enough lens.  In other words they run before they can walk.  From my experience, with a few exceptions (like the 28 - 135 mm F3.5 - 5.6--I think that this is a good lens- or the 24-105 F4 IS), the kit lens, IMHO, are made for a single reason, for cost. They won't give you a bad image, but if great images are what you want, then the lens makes all the difference in the world. In the film days I would say the body doesn't matter (to some extent), buy the lens first and then work your way up to the bigger and better camera. It will help you, cameras with less features will help you understand photography more.  Does this mean everyone has to buy a Canon L lens, no, there are some good lenses, but you have to research which ones are right for you.Lens - I saw many reviews about different lens how this one is better than that one.  One person couldn't tell the difference between a *lens kit* and an L lens.  I would say to the person, you aren't paying attention to the detail and you are paying too much attention to the subject. The L lens system is the best quality glass in the canon system; it's designed to be better than any other lens in the system. L lens are also designed for the working professional. It's made to last and they do. Lens that are in the kit aren't made to last and aren't designed with the working professional in mind, they are designed for people who want to keep cost down.The Canon 50 1.4 and 85 1.8 are, IMHO, the best prime lens on the market. They will give you the best image quality, period.As for the reviews on dpreview and image-resource, they still highly recommend this camera.

If you're seriously considering doing some professional photography but you're a little irked by the price tag of DSLR offerings ($2,000 for the body and above), then stop here.  You will not be disappointed.For those reviews stating that images are \"too soft\", etc., please check Jodi-Ann Richards' review that nearly has 600 helpful votes (as of 1/29/09).  She covers the camera in exhaustive detail.If you don't have time to review her pages-long review, however, here's a quick summary of her bottom line:  this camera's megapixel count of 15.1 REQUIRES GOOD OPTICS.  It follows the old saying of \"garbage in garbage out\".  If you buy cheap optics, then you'll be horrifically disappointed.  You need the good optics to exploit the most of its 15.1 megapixel capabilities.  That said, some reviews (notably dpreview.com) have stated that the increase of 5 megapixels from the 40D and the 50D are hardly noticeable, but keep in mind that they are testing the camera using one of the cheaper lens options.  They do go on to say, however, that the megapixel count does demand good optics.  I dare say that they would have been more pleased with the image quality if they had purchased one of Canon's \"L\" lenses.I personally bought a Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM lens (\"L\" is Canon's \"flagship\" line).  The lens itself costs almost the same as the body itself, but is well worth it.  The optics on this lens and the autofocus speed (lightning quick for a walkabout telephoto) is superb and the image results do not disappoint.  Also, being able to maintain a f/4 aperture throughout the full length of the zoom is nice.If you're looking into professional work, feel that the Canon Rebel doesn't give you the control that you'd like, and feel that spending more than $2,000 for a camera body is too much, then this is your camera.  It maintains the balance of being able to be fully automatic to allowing you to manually adjust aperture, ISO speed, shutter speed, etc. by yourself.You will not be disappointed with this purchase - just remember to get a GOOD LENS for this camera.

Half of me says it was the right thing to do, and half of me says it was a mistake.  Under the right conditions, the 50D's resolution is very impressive.  It has produced some very nice shots.  The extra pixels not only mean finer detail, but also, greater smoothness.The 50D also, however, generates more noise and captures less color and tone contrast than the 40D.  The dpreview dynamic range tests show the 50D lagging behind the 40D by over 2/3's of a stop in the shadow end.  Many of the images I've shot with the 50D clearly reflect this weakness; hair, for example, can take on that matted, muddy look.The 50D's greater resolution gives me more freedom with cropping.  I can shoot a scene \"big\" and know I can trim it later and still produce a high quality image.  Color and tone accuracy and balance are typically Canon-like.  But my 40D did a much better job in mid and low light, and the tone curve it produced was easier for me to work with in Photoshop.I understand now why Canon announced the 50D as a companion to the 40D, rather than a replacement.  I do like the 50D's increased resolution, but the 40D is arguably the better or more versatile photographic tool.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R2M76NO25B3JEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why buy a 50D? It's been 3.5 years since this body came out. It's been succeeded by the 60D and 7D in Canon's line and dozens of other bodies from competing manufacturers. Why not opt for them?Here's the reason: it's a flaming value. The 50D was never a popular body. It's almost identical to the 40D in physical design, menus, and most specifications, and it doesn't have video or whiz-bang features of dubious utility. As a result, it's dumped on the used market. I bought one with 3000 shutter clicks (design life: 100,000) for $550. The 60D is about $750. The 40D, $350.I'm a professional photographer. The 40D was my workhorse body for three years. I adore it. It's very quick and very reliable. How does the the 50D compare?+ LCD has dramatically improved contrast and resolution+ Image review is even more immediate+ Write speed with my 400X Sandisk cards is unimpeachable; you can bang off 18 raw files and the write light extinguishes in four seconds+ More accurate color at high ISOs+ Compatible with Magic Lantern Unified, an open-source alternate firmware that adds 1080p/30 video recording (without sound) and dozens of useful features (e.g., intervalmeter, 9-shot bracketing, extended bulb mode)+ AF micro-adjustment- More prone to blowing out highlights- Per-pixel noise is higherAF micro-adjustment is the reason I bought it. My new 50/1.4 backfocuses on my 40D. The last time I sent a copy of this lens to Canon, it took them three tries to get it right. Shipping is $20 each time and it takes two weeks to get it back, and that's if your lens is under warranty. Out-of-warranty service adjustment is around $100. Particularly with wide-aperture and third party lenses, this feature is enormously useful.What about the 60D? Is that worth another $200? If you don't need video, probably not. Here's how the 60D lines up:+ Integrated video mode and Magic Lantern compatibility. The 50D's video mode (enabled by Magic Lantern) isn't as stable and will never have sound.+ Sensor is a 1/2 stop better (i.e., usable to ISO 3200)+ Rear LCD articulates+- Body size and weight are similar. The 60D has a slightly deeper (read: better) grip.+- SD instead of CF- No AF micro-adjustment- No flash sync socket- No multi-select joystick- 5.3 fps vs. 6.3 fps with the 50DAnd the 7D? What are you getting for double the price relative to the 50D?+ Integrated video mode and Magic Lantern compatibility (same as 60D)+ Sensor is a 1/2 stop better (same as 60D)+ New AF system with better focus tracking+ 8 fps vs. 6.3 fpsIn actual use, the 50D and 7D (and 40D for that matter) are somewhat more agile than the 60D. CF media is quicker than SD, so while the 60D has to stop and write for awhile after a stream of raw shots, the 50D is ready to go almost immediately, despite shooting an extra frame every second. The loss of the joystick is another major omission. You can select any AF point immediately on the 50D by rocking your thumb. The 60D requires more methodical button-pressing.Otherwise, there's not much between them. I might have opted for the 60D if Canon hadn't nixed the AF micro-adjustment. And if my 40D had had that feature, I wouldn't have upgraded to the 50D. Really, for almost all but the most demanding photography, (read: shooting in darkness or AF-tracking fast objects), any body from the 20D onward will get out of your way. And that's all you really need.For sheer competence and speed of operation, I consider the 50D the second-best value in a still-photograph DSLR today.

The vast improvement in ISO performance, functions, menu, fps, etc. was invaluable. As my skills have progressed, I am looking forward to the opportunities afforded to me by the very powerful 50D. I will have to enhance my skills even more to fully use this camera. So for those moving from the Rebel line to an xxD series, this is a great move. Or if this is your first DSLR you will not be disappointed. However, if you already own an xxD (such as the very popular 40D), then this is probably not the best choice for you. As some comprehensive reviews have shown, the 50D is not a major advancement from the 40D and really only offers some new features such as improved LCD, micro-AF adjustment, and a larger sensor. However, it does not beat and sometimes looses to the 40D in terms of noise and per-pixel sharpness, although both are still hotly debated.  The point being, if you are moving from the rebel series or this is your first camera, it is amazing, powerful, and you will not be disappointed. However, it is not, evolutionary to the xxD line, and is not a necessary trade-up for current xxD owners. This does not mean it is a bad or non-improved camera.

One reason I chose the 50D over waiting for the 5D MkII was I could use everything I already had for my 30D. So I can continue to use my batteries, grip and remote release.The new screen is perhaps the most obvious upgrade to anyone used to a 30 or 20D, the screen is stunningly clear and the higher resolution is obvious from the moment you turn it on.The Digic 4 menu system is far easier to get along with compared to previous models, and the user custom menu allows you to configure your favorite options all on one place.The 15 megapixel sensor is honestly overkill in my opinion, there is way too much attention pushed to the 'make it higher everytime' by camera companies. 8 megapixels is more than enough for most people out there and big enough for most normal size prints, I've printed up to 13 inches without any problem. The one thing the extra mega pixels does give you is the option to crop closer in post processing.Live view is nice, but I'll probably never use it. One of the reasons I like my DSLR over my point and shoot is the way the view finder allows me to see nothing but the shot and compose exactly the way I want without any distractions. Personally I still think Live view is an odd feature to put in a mid to high range DSLR but I can see where Canon would want to target those people used to point and shoot cameras. And most likely is something designed to get slowly move us towards the video/still camera style of which the 5D mkII is the future I'm sure.I have to say at first I was some what concerned how sharp the images were at the full resolution, I shoot with the 24-105 F4/L and 70-200 F/4L and both of those lenses are incredibly sharp on my 30D. However I believe now that it is the software that is to blame, I have never been impressed with Canon's software and am delighted that Adobe has released Camera RAW 4.6 to allow me to get back into Bridge and Photoshop CS3. I hope that Lightroom 2.1 gets released soon as that is my normal workflow and image management application. (I do also use Aperture 2 but I am sure that will be a while before it becomes compatible with 50D RAW files).The in camera JPEG files are OK...until you see what the RAW files can do, but at times it's nice to use in camera JPEG's when I am just doing point and shot stuff.The camera feels very solid, and the build quality is excellent, the main scroll wheel feels much better than my 30D which always felt a little soft on the clicks.I am concerned that for the first time today I got the err99 that many have reported and I am hoping it was a one off and not a sign of pending hardware failure in a camera less than one month old, there is plenty of posts out there on dpreview.com discussing these problems and I suggest reading them.Overall I am happy with the upgrade (assuming the err99 does not become a problem, I've never had this with a Canon DSLR before), but when it comes down to the images I have to say that I'm not seeing anything that justifies the upgrade price for any 30D owners and certainly not 40D owners. The two main reasons I upgraded are the new screen that finally enables me to check focus and the sensor cleaner (dust was always a problem on my 30D sensor).", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 50d (with 28-135 lens) -  review", "Author": "Abdelrahman Elmously", "ReviewID": "R38X49E53D90MB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this camera + lens now for more than 4 months ... i have taken this camera to its limit ... this review will be the result of my test to this camera. also what i liked , disliked and also what i would hope for the next cameras. also how does this camera compare to it's rivals.Section 1 : canon 50d camera review1 : Image size and quality :-for this camera ... i believe that canon really invested a lot in the quality of the images of the sensor. the quality is just amazing. The color information and the contrast in the levels is just unbelievable, actually i don't believe that pictures are that awesome without any kind of post processing. and of course the 15 megapixels are worth it. at first i had a rebel and i didn't think that the extra 3 mega pixels will make a difference, but i was wrong. the 15 mega pixels is something entirely different from the 12 mega pixels. but keep in mind that the large mega pixel comes with a price. the size of the images are LARGE. i use 8gb CF cards, it takes almost 400 images. and also the compact flash is expensive cards if you are aiming for UDMA cards. Conclusion ... if you are looking for a good image quality and you don't want to pay 2000$+ i would say that this camera is the best choice.2 : Camera Speed : if there is one thing i really love about this body, it is the speed. I am not talking about the 6.3 frames per second, i am talking about the camera speed itself. processing, menus, image playback, shutter lag, start up time; basically the time you take to change anything in the camera. it is extremely fast, u just can't keep up with her. also the auto focus is very fast(this also partially the lens). but also the camera performance in terms of metering, focus adjust is also extremely fast. then of course, the 6.3 frames persecond ... not the fastest in the market of course. but as far as i need. i don't think i will need more than this speed.3 : Low light performance : for me, this will be the only think missing from canon. there is no doubt that canon will lose in any comparison in low light conditions against Nikon. It is a fact that the Nikon cameras just produces amazing image quality at low light conditions than the canon does. However, the high ISO performance in the 50D is really acceptable. You get noise FREE images all the way up to 500. noise is noticeable at 1000. and of course after that it is noisy.i am talking about the 100% frame crops. the bottom line the high ISO performance of this camera is acceptable, but don't think that you will out-photograph a Nikon (D90) guy in low light using this camera.4  : Build quality : the first thing that you pick on right after you hold this camera is the build quality. Instantly you feel like you are holding a machine, you feel the build quality of this camera. if you hold a D90 after this camera you feel like you are holding a toy. i think that it is the best you get for this price tag.5  : Ergonomics  :Canon cameras are ugly. the first thing i thought when i held this camera \" a brick wall with buttons \", also the big pain canon delivers with changing the layout and functionality of the buttons and the body outer design with each release. Canon is just still way behind in terms of ergonomics compared to Nikon. But don't worry, it is just one week of photography and you will get used to this camera. the problem will be if you are using another canon body. The body is indeed heavy, when i am doing a complete photography day, i usually get cramps in my arms at the end of the day. One key think i like about this camera is the back wheel; much better in use than the Nikon's back dial.6 : Ease of use :if you are a canon user ... u will be familiar with the \" organized \" menu system and options of the canon cameras. i find this camera very easy to use. to change the camera option between one shot and the other, i would say it is easy to use.Soooo ... to conclude ... i think this camera is an extremely good investment if you are willing to put up with ugly ergonomics and you are not looking specifically for low light photography. Other than that this camera will perform extremely good in any other condition.What i really hate :- There is no wireless flash controller. The D90 has one, canon should strongly consider this option. already released in the 7d ... but too late- Some of the buttons in this camera doesn't make sense. (the AF-on button, also the flash exposure button on the top of the camera)- I HATE the CA mode. it is like canon is reminding us that this camera is not for serious photographers. It is for people who doesn't know nothing about photography. and this is a very big problem in the market message that canon is sending to it's customers. I mean who would pay 1200$ in a camera if he doesn't have the basics of D-SLR photography, if this camera is for begginers, then why there is a rebel production line in the first place. same also with the 5D mark II, even it is embarrassing with the later.- Some of the menu options just makes you angry. also doesn't make any sense.that is about it. except from these points ... i LOVE This camera.before the end of the camera part i would like to mention a point for canon that not a lot of people are aware of. canon supplies their professional software for free with the camera. Nikon only provide a viewer. The canon Digital photo professional is an awesome tools. if you are shooting raw. then this would be the best. they keep enhancing it release after release and i find my self not using photoshop or lightroom any more.This is as far as the camera goes.now :Section II : the 28 - 135 lens review :i will try to be as fast as i can as this is getting to long1- Coverage range : when you start using this lens you would realize that this was targeted to the full frame cameras. the 28 is extremely narrow. if you are planing to get landscape images ... FORGET it. the 135 on the other hand is really useful (with the 1.6 factor). you get good zoom on this camera ... like u are using a 70-200 on a full frame body. So this lens would make a great general purpose lens on a full frame body, however it is acceptable on this body.2- Quality & performance : this lens delivers nice sharp results, relatively accurate in terms of focusing and extremely fast. produces a  very smooth bokeh detail when pushed to its lowest f stop. u see some chromatic aberrations around some edges in pictures which are not exposed correctly. i didn't feel any vignetting in the pictures. in all ... this lens will deliver you an image with extremely satisfactory results.(if you know how to adjust the camera options to make the most of it)3- Build quality : like the 50D, really good but really heavy. one thing i don't like about this lens is that if you are pointing it downwards, you find the barrel zooming in automatically (cuz of the heavy glass element in the front). same thing happens if you are pointing it upwards.i would suggest u get the lens hood, also a UV filter. the filter size is HUGE for a kit lens. and you will find it collecting lots of smudges and dust.To conclude on all :I love this camera, it's pros so much out weights its cons. i would suggest this camera for anyone who wants to get out of the rebel line, it would also make a great back up body for those using 1ds and 5ds. with relatively low price, and you will get a very satisfactory results. Don't believe the reviews talking about low quality images. wither they don't know how to use the camera, or they are using bad lenses.finally ...  how much it compares to :D90 : (almost the same price 200$ difference )depends on what you want. if you are not looking for low light performance, then this is the camera for you.D300 : it is not available anymore, as Nikon introduced the d300s which is aimed at a higher end market with much expensive price tag. i would go with this camera. at least canon still puts it in its camera list :-).7D : if you have no problems spending extra 600$ then of course get the 7d, all the cons in the 50d are gone in the 7D. but i would prefer to get a 50D then step up from it to a 5d MarkII.well ... that is it.i hope this review was useful. i tried to outline all the things i really like and hate in this camera.please feel free to comment and ask about anything in this review.thanksMously", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "A GREAT Leap Forward.....", "Author": "Robert \"FreeMan\"", "ReviewID": "R2A1SALB8ZYM5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To date, I have owned several Canon DSLR cameras.

My previous camera was the Digital Rebel Xti and the improvement in image quality over this, using the same lens, is very noticeable, particularly in landscape images where there is a lot of contrast between areas of sunshine and shadow.

(Money-saving tip: Radio Shack sell a mini-HDMI/HDMI adapter, which allows me to use a standard HDMI cable to connect the camera to the television - much cheaper than Canon's HTC100 cable).I don't use the Live View option (I'm old-fashioned and prefer to look through the viewfinder) but I can see it could be useful in some circumstances, like close-up photography.I was thinking of upgrading to the 40D but decided to wait for the 50D to be released and I'm very glad I did.

That camera served me very well throughout the years, but it had some limitations.In all aspects this new EOS 50D camera seriously outperforms the other camera on a large margin.As a sign of excellently built and sturdiness, this camera with a Tokina 12-24 ATX Pro zoom lens and a Speedlight EX-430 flash attached, recently fell on the wood floor of my house, from my tripod. Tripod was faulty and the head separated from the tripod body. I was horrified. To my amazement, nothing happened. I do not know how lucky I was, but I won't ever play with my luck again. I bought a new tripod since.LCD display: 3\" diagonal, bright, high res. LCD display, easily viewable indoors and out, a pleasure to use, compared to the small 1.8\" diagonal LCD display of the EOS 10D.Exposure meter: much more accurate, compared to the older camera. Canon cameras, over the years typically underexposed, when a wide angle lens was used. This one seems to have overcome that issue. Extremely accurate exposures on evaluative metering, with or without flash.Color accuracy: an improvement over EOS 10D. in order to achieve vibrant, true to life colors, I used to crank the saturation control on the older camera to the max. This one seems to achieve true and vibrant colors on \"standard\" pic mode... however this \"standard\" pic mode, also cranks saturation to high :)Pictures noise: very low noise on high ASA/ISO setting. I read several reviews stating that compared to EOS 40D this camera is more noisy. I do not know the 40D much, but compared to 10D, this camera shines at high ISO settings. I used ISO 3200 and pics are very smooth. At Hi sensitivity setting (presumed ISO 6400), the noise is visually comparable to ISO 1600 settings on the older camera (on a 23\"LCD computer screen). I did not try yet the 12800 (Hi-2) setting, but I have heard it is noisy.Resolution: 15 mpixels... WOW! Images are razor sharp and extremely detailed. I did quite well with 6 mpixels on EOS 10D but this is amazing.Flash card read/write speed: I am using Sandisk Extreme III flash memory cards. It may be even better with Extreme-IV series. Transfer speed from the camera body to the PC and also using a Sandisk extreme  USB 2.0 reader, extremely high. Files simply zap, even 20 MB RAW files...  Amazing!Well done Canon!

Nikon, to me, has superior ergonomics - the buttons and functions are so well thought out.  Canon works well too but sometimes I feel like I need to be double jointed to change a setting.  I do not like the wheel on top; the silver color is not great and it turns to easily.  I have switched modes in the middle of shooting and not known it.  But, the camera feels solid, the screen is absolutely amazing, the menus are super easy to navigate, the 6 frames per second is impressive.  15 megapixels; well, you only need it if you are printing larger than 20\" or so.  I've done 26\" prints with a 10 megapixel, and if you know what you are doing and use a great printer it's flawless.  As for low noise - well, it's low, but I'm not blown away.  Remember all your lenses will be 1.6 times their focal length, so it's hard to go wide angle with this camera.  But, it's easy to get super tele photo.  I use it with the 24-105 L lens, which costs almost as much as the camera is worth it.This decisions is tricky - it's very solid, I recommend it.  But if I were a first time DSLR buyer right now looking at mid-range cameras, Canon has no advantage over Nikon.  The D90 is terrific and cheaper, the D300 and D700 are amazing.  Why did I switch to Canon?  Simply because I like their lenses better on the high end.  The Nikon 80-400 is slow as a dog, although sharp.  I would much rather have the Canon 100-400 L.  Nikon's high end lenses seem to be a little more expensive, and frankly, there are fewer out there so they are harder to find, new or used.Good luck, happy shooting, this a great camera.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great step up from Digital Rebel Series", "Author": "S.

I am the person who doesn't usually care for \"fancy\" features, but the first thing that you notice is the difference in the LCD display. Makes it very easy to review pictures ... I usually shoot my indoor shots without flash, I like the warm feel of pictures it produces, but often causes the pictures to be blurry. Often you can't see that the picture is blurry until it has been downloaded to the computer and then it is too late to rewind time and fix it. So LOVE the detail this LCD shows and the excellent contrast it offers.The wheel makes browsing through pictures a lot easier. The joystick based menu makes it easy to customize your settings. The LCD display on top gives you a quick glance at all the settings without having to look inside the viewfinder (also great for checking/showing a newbie what settings you are using and why). The C1 and C2 settings can be used to remember your favorite custom settings for tricky conditions and can be a real time saver.The Higher ISO settings (3200,6400) can come in pretty handy for taking pictures in low light without a flash, despite the noise - I prefer using the noise reduction features with the high ISO despite of the loss of detail that comes with it.

It's been a great camera and I love it, but now that I'm starting to do more weddings, I needed a more semi-professional camera to keep up with the pace and strain of your average wedding.  I had been looking to get the 50D for some time and after I was paid for a wedding and the 60D was announced (looks like Canon is making the XXD line more consumer oriented), I knew it was time to get the 50D.Having come from using the T1i, the first thing I had to get used to was all the buttons.  Seriously, there are more buttons on the 50D because parameters like meter, white balance, etc. have their own button rather than having to go through menus like on the T1i.  But this makes adjustments much faster, since there are less menus to dig into.  And the adjustment wheel on the back of the camera is awesome, again because it makes adjustments quick.  I no longer have to press a button to adjust exposure compensation, I can just use the wheel on the back.The camera is also quieter than the T1i.  Shutter and mirror noise from the 50D are noticeably quieter than the T1i.  This will help greatly with the weddings I'll be shooting and with more photojournalistic shoots.Everything else about the camera is a step up from the T1i.  Just a few things I really like are the faster burst rate (6 fps sounds like a machine gun) and having all the focus points be cross type, which aids greatly in low light focusing (espcially with a fast prime, like my 85mm f/1.8).  All this will help me capture weddings much better.The only drawback is that the 50D with a grip (I bought an Opteka) is quite big and heavy.  The T1i with a battery grip felt pretty hefty, but the 50D with a grip feels like I'm carrying around a brick.  I'm sure over time I'll get used to the weight, but for now I usually think twice about carrying the 50D around.  It does help a lot to get a padded shoulder strap (I found one by Targus that was only $10).As I continue to grow my photography business, I have confidence now tackling more jobs with the 50D compared to just having the T1i.

Rios \"The Happy Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RWGXJXVOZMT7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by stating that the product was loosely packaged by Amazon.com. I recall another customer mentioning the samething. Hopefully, Amazon will read this and review their packaging procedures. However, Canon's foam packaging within the box made sure that nothing happened. Also, everything that was supposed to be included by Canon was. Nothing was missing. I must say, however, that more than not, Amazon does an excellent job of packaging their orders and seeing that the product is delivered on time.Before I go any further, I do need to say that I own a Canon Rebel XSI and will from time to time be making a comparison between the 50D and the XSI. I purchased the 50D for approx. $1060 and the XSI for $550. As soon as I placed the battery and a lense on the 50D I could notice a distinct difference in weight and a obvious sense that this camera was built to last a long time, as compared to the lightweight XSI, which has a plastic feel. The 50D also felt very nice and secure in my hands.The ergonomics of the 50D was easy to get used to after spending a brief amount of time with it. Most of functions can be easily accessed with the two dials and the buttons are well placed. I've had the camera for a month now and have not accidently pushed or moved anything that has caused the camera to reset itself. However, I do question Canon's decision to use two \"on\" positions: one for auto/semi-auto and the other for manual. Some of the features which distinguishes the 50D from the XSI deals with the 920,000 mp LCD display, the 1/8,oooth sec. shutter speed which allows you to use a wider aperture in the daylight allowing for a magnificent DOF (depth of field), as well as a better noise reduction system letting the user use a 800 ISO setting indoors while still retaining a nice quality image, whereas the XSI can only be used for up to 400 ISO before seeing a degradation of the image due to noise and its shutter speed only goes to 1/4,000 sec. However, when both cameras are used up to 400 ISO, most of us wouldn't be able to see the difference in image quality to be honest.Another important advantage which the 50D has over it's predecessors, as well as cameras by other manufacturers, is it's autofocus.I've been able to quickly focus on objects in dimly lit areas where I wasn't able to with other cameras. Time and time again, I've been very pleased with it's low light focusing capabilities. Not only that, but its autofocus lock has to be one of the best, if not the best, in it's class. Very rarely do I experience any backfocus issues with this camera, whereas with the XSI it's a common problem. What I also enjoy using with this camera is the custom white balance which is necessary from time to time in the studio since various flashes and backgrounds can create situations causing the camera to get off white balance. Canon has made this procedure very easy. You simply take a picture of a neutral grey background, select the custom white balance on the menu, then press the white button on the top of the camera. Now, I have had a few \"err\" messages which has been noted by other owners, but they have been few. Out of about 40,000 shots so far, I've gotten 3 \"err\" messages. I simply turn the camera off and detach the battery for approx. 30 sec. and put it back in and turn the camera on and everything is okay.There's no question that in regards to build quality, the 50D is a winner. Not only when compared to the XSI, but also with other cameras in its class. It'll definitely out last and be able to withstand the elements better than the XSI. It's abilty to focus quickly in low light situations and hold its focus is without comparison. Not only that, but with the 920,000 mp LCD display, 1/8,000th sec. shutter speed, and improved noise reduction system, professionals and semi-pros alike can make good use of this capable camera. But if you're a beginner, or enthusiast, you may want to consider the XSI and use the $500 you save on memory cards, a good lense, or the 580 EX II flash. Either way, you can't go wrong with the 50D or the XSI.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is the camera I have been looking for", "Author": "hvacigar", "ReviewID": "R11Y2NW89AS0XE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an active hobbyist photographer for about 15 years.

Picht", "ReviewID": "R610FMLKET5GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is aimed at my fellow amateurs, first time DSLR buyers who want to take their new cameras out shooting pictures of bugs, their kids, and their vacations. I like my Canon EOS 50D very, very much. I've owned it for three months, I've traveled several thousand miles with it, and I've shot over 2,000 pictures in conditions ranging from swampy humidity to dry cold to light rain and fog. I've tried it out in low-light interiors without flash, I've used zoom and macro lenses to shoot birds, insects, flowers, landscapes, and my children at play, and I've been very pleased with its performance and durability across the board.The 50D menus are easy to navigate. They're simply and logically laid out. They don't make the instruction manual unnecessary (far from it), but they make it very easy for me to find menu items without looking them up. The three-inch, high-resolution LCD panel is stunning. It makes reading the menu items easy on my aging eyes, even in bright sunlight, and it allows me to see clearly the images I've shot. The zoom feature for image playback is very easy to use, and when the image is blown up to maximum size on the screen, the multi-controller button makes navigating around it easy as well. \"Easy\" is the word I keep using here, and it applies to just about every feature of this camera.I like the placement of the various buttons and controls. My wife does not. I'm tall with long and slender fingers; my wife is not tall and her hands are not large. For me this camera just feels right, and my fingers move naturally to the controls. My wife says the camera feels too bulky and she thinks the controls are awkwardly placed. She hasn't actually gone out to to take pictures with it and has only held it to see what it's like, but I think it's a safe bet that she wouldn't choose the 50D as her camera.The battery life is good. On my last trip I was able to shoot around 600 pictures before I had to install the second battery.  I didn't use the LCD monitor to compose my shots, I didn't make much use of the flash, and I made sparing use of the lens-stabilization feature, but I did spend a few minutes each night looking at the day's pictures on the LCD monitor as I decided which ones to get rid of. I've spent the last week trying to take pictures of hummingbirds in my backyard with the zoom lens fully extended, so I've been using stabilization with every shot and it eats up battery fast. The camera powers down when I don't use it for a minute, but it comes back on the instant I hit the shutter button. I tend not to turn it off with the on/off switch when I'm carrying it around, just to let it power down on its own. The one problem I sometimes run into is that it's easy to hit the playback button by accident (it bumps against my hip at just the right (or wrong) angle when the camera is hanging from my shoulder), and when that happens the display comes on and stays on until I turn it off. I've been out walking and several times looked down to see that big, bright LCD panel showing the last picture I shot, eating up power as if I had a pocket full of batteries. I could just turn the camera off between shots (when I turn it on it's ready to take pictures by the time I get the viewfinder up to my eye) but for some reason I prefer to grumble and turn the screen back off.I haven't commented on the pictures this camera takes. Those depend crucially on the lens you use. I bought a Tamron 18-270mm zoom lens, and I've borrowed a friend's 60mm Canon macro lens and a lower end telephoto. The 15 megapixel sensor will show every weakness of your lens. My Tamron does a very nice job, but that telephoto was bad. The macro has been adequate, but I'm going to save my pennies to buy the very best I can when I get my own. I wouldn't settle for one of the standard kit lenses that are often sold with DSLRs. They can take nice pictures with a smaller sensor, but with the larger sensor in this camera they're a non-starter. I wouldn't buy this camera without setting aside about the same amount of money to buy a lens for it. My only other comment on picture-quality has to do with the ISO. I've had no problem at all taking indoor shots without flash. At ISO 1600 the pictures are nice and clear. At 3200 they're a little grainy, but not bad. I haven't tried the expansion to 6400 or 12,800, and I'm sure the images they produce are probably pretty grainy, but it's nice to know that I can go there if I have to. If I'm taking a picture of my daughter during her dance recital from the back of a badly lit auditorium, a bit of noise is okay if I still get the shot.I had one problem with this camera that I could and should have avoided. I bought a Canon because I already had a very good lens on my Canon EOS Elan II, a film camera that I loved but hadn't used much in the last seven years since my wife game me a digital point-and-shoot for my birthday. I decided I wanted to start taking photography more seriously and wanted a DSLR camera, after considerable research I decided that the Canon and Nikon products were very closely comparable, and I decided to be fiscally responsible by going with a Canon so that I wouldn't have to buy a new lens right away. Imagine my distress when I discovered that my Sigma lens wouldn't work properly on my new camera - no autofocus and a frozen aperture. The problem, I'm told, is that Sigma doesn't pay a licensing fee to Canon, so there are issues with compatibility as Canon updates its line. I don't blame Canon for this, but had I known about the compatibility problem, it might have changed my cost/benefit calculation in favor of Nikon. Probably not, but the lesson is that one shouldn't just check to see that lenses are forward compatible, but that a particular manufacturer's lenses are forward compatible. I stopped investigating when I learned that EF-mount lenses were compatible with an EFS-mount camera, and that was a mistake.There's a lot more I could write about this camera, but that's probably better covered by more technically knowledgeable reviewers. The bottom line is that I am very pleased with my EOS 50D. I'm having a great time learning to use it and I'm finding that it offers more than I can actually take full advantage of (it gives me a great deal of room to grow). It's ruggedly built, easy to use, nice to handle. And my wife just informed me that if I'm very good, Santa just might bring me that macro lens I'm wanting.

On the xti, I could not take a picture during a wedding and it not make a loud sound that ruined it all!  On the 50D, it is a lot quieter.

I also discovered how addictive shooting digital can be (8GB minimum is a must) so I just the let the shutter burn and ended up taking over 1000 photos over 8 days.On the coastline I put the camera in continuous mode and the high burst rate practically gave me video of the waves crashing into the shore when you view the photos in rapid succession.

The picture quality is only limited by the rather average quality of the lens - the 18-200mm Canon IS lens is not the one for highest quality sharp images but it IS a very useful lens which covers almost the entire range of wide angle to medium zoom.  However, the camera's 15MP sensor is capable of a much sharper resolution and beautiful images than this lens can produce, so the camera's resolution exceeds the lens resolution by quite a bit.  (you can look at image samples with various lenses a photozone.de and at dpreview.com).The low light performance is also very good, but the flash is rather limited with a limited coverage distance and poor evenness.  However, one cannot expect much from the built-in flashes of DSLRs and if you are serious about flash photography, you would want the superb Canon 580 series flash...The camera is quite large so you would need a fairly large pair of hands but not too big that it would overwhelm you.  It has a very ergonomic grip and logical menus and controls.It can take really quick photos too if you get a UDMA compact flash card.  I have a 300x UDMA and it works beautifully.

All this time I've never paid much attention...most of the time I just thought it was user error somehow.  Recently a fellow photographer friend mentioned that the Canon 50D was said to have bad reviews for the noise and picture quality...the reason being because they packed too much mega pixels into it.  More pixels does NOT mean better quality on the smaller sensor cameras.  I've had it too long to return now...so I'm just stuck with a crappy camera.

And I was an early adopter for the switch to digital, although I stuck with film for my serious work until the pixel count got high enough for a decent 5 X 7.  Then I put away my film camera for good.I upgraded my camera frequently until I got the Canon 20D.  I stuck with the 20D until now.  The 30D and 40D just didn't add enough in features or pixel count to entice me.  But the 50D tipped the scale and I again upgraded.  And I'm glad that I did.  It's a great camera, worth the asking price.What's so great about it?  Simple, features and pixels.  You can read all of the technical stuff elsewhere, but the automatic modes and the program modes just work.  Yes, I know all about depth of field and manual controls from the days when that all that there was, if you wanted good pictures.  But nothing beats the landscape, portrait, or macro settings on a Canon camera.  If you want a portrait, set the dial.  The camera sets the depth of field properly and you can concentrate on your subject, not the camera.  Same goes for the other auto modes.  The camera balances every setting in the same way that I used to do it.  So why not let the camera do the work?  I really tough situations, I will switch to the program mode to gain a little more control, but that's not often.There has been a lot of noise in the last year or two about the idea that \"pixel count doesn't matter.\"  Don't let 'em fool you.  Talk like that is just a way to justify selling an inferior product.  Oh, they're right, if you want a 4 X 5 snapshot.  Even some phone cameras today can give you that.  And a pro can get by with 8 or 9 MP, if they don't want to crop the photo after it's been shot.  But for me, 15 MP is the minimum for a good camera.Why do I want at least 15 MP?  That's easy, I want pixels to throw away.  I shoot landscapes, animals, people and flowers.  Usually at a fast pace.  I can't spend a whole day, or a week, on one perfect shot, although I know photographers who do.  I see a shot, I shoot it and I move on.  I make it perfect in post processing, on my computer (and I only use Macs, for the same reason that I use Canon, they work).  I do a lot of my composition after the fact, I throw away pixels.  I crop out the extra stuff to get the right composition out of the shot.My 50D lets me work fast, take a lot of pictures and keep far more than I throw away.  I can use all of my collected lenses and that's another big plus.  I have lenses, that I still use, from my old film camera.Yes, I too, love my Canon 50D.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "$50 per megapixel, what else is new Canon?", "Author": "Mod Professor", "ReviewID": "R2IGP7MW02U7JF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For a long time Canon user, this camera turned out to be an extreme disappointment. Over the years I trained myself (and suspect many other folks did) to not sallivate over Nikon bodies, instead concentrating on what matters - the sensor, quality lens lineup, and affordability that Canon has always offered in its semi-pro DSLRs. With 50D, all that is gone.1. The sensor: has higher noise and lower dynamic range compared to predecessor (40D), competition (D90) and cheaper models (Rebel XSi) - I ran my own tests, but don't take my word for it and check other photography sites. I would like to remind to all those who say that the image quality is still decent that one of the main reasons one buys a DSLR is to use it for available light photography. So what if the sensor now has 15 megapixels and \"gapless microlenses\", if a shot of a sleeping child in a dimly lit room turns out worse than with a camera costing $400-$600 less? What exactly are you paying for? Of course, you can downsample all you want, but the end result is a 7.5 megapixel image (or even less) - what kind of progress is that?2. Gigantic RAW files. If you shoot JPEGs, don't bother. I shoot RAW almost exclusively and with 50D the RAW files are on average 20-30MB. They will fill up an average size hard drive in no time. A typical photo shoot, say a soccer game, will require 2-3 standard capacity DVDs to archive. Of course, now there is sRAW support, but even though picture size is halved, the files themselves are not much smaller. And then again, you paid for 15MP camera, right? If Canon intended to use full 15MP for, umm, \"landscape photography\", then you will probably be better off by carrying one of those 14MP point-and-shoots for such occasions. And don't think that upgrading your hard drive and buying a drum of DVDs will set you up... RAW files now take 2-3 times longer to process (at least in Canon's DPP), so a whole new computer might be in order. It woudn't be an issue, if the image quality were superior, but it is in fact worse.3. Little to no improvement in auto-focus performance. Again, if you mostly shoot buildings and trees and posing brides amd grooms, never mind. Even birds are palatable. For action/sports photography, wiggly children, difficult scenes with complex foreground-background mix, the results will be no better than with any prior Canon, which is to say you'll be lucky if your keeper rate is above 50% (or if you don't mind an occasional blur, after all, with 15MP one can downsample that much more :))4. No improvement in metering system and still no proper implementation of Auto ISO selection. It's 2008, but you are still getting the same (read: unreliable) functionality as back in 2000. Enough said.To conclude: I wouldn't be harping too much - after all, as I mentioned there is no perfect DSLR bodies, and eventually one learns to live with their limitations - but the turn Canon took with 50D is just deplorable. There is simply no use case for 15MP cropped sensor DSLR. I could already print near poster size prints from XSi files. For web publishing, you really need 6-8MP tops. The areas that needed improvement remain the same as they were years ago. In the meantime the competition keeps marching forward. All you get with 50D is a nicer LCD and more megapixels that you will ever need or be able to handle. Put the megapixel count aside, and quite simply, 50D is lagging behind much of the competition. If you do not have a large investment in Canon lenses, you will really be better off looking elsewhere.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera is absolutely the best for my family!!!", "Author": "Nutella lover \"Nuts for nutella\"", "ReviewID": "R11FKIFVJ8G92F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3 young children and have recently departed the realm of point-and-shoot through the Rebel XsI (great camera).

However I was also disapointed at candid pics at their b-parties and indoor events (Christmas especially) for lighting (poor) and shutter speed.  The XsI was a great camera, but once I decided that sometimes it is definetely worth to carry a bigger camera, I also decided to have a really excellent one, since the extra weight and size when you go the SLR route is basically the same. I still keep a Canon G10 in my personal bag at all times, but I have to say I LOVE my 50D!!!!I played with buying better lens for the Xsi (including the L series, HUGE 24-70 for $1,100, which I returned) but first, the camera felt absolutely unbalanced, with its body being very plastic and light and the lens being super well built as a tank and heavy. Then, I am a pixel lover and if there is a 15 megapixel that I can easily afford by selling the Xsi, than I had to do it.

Unless you are using raw (recommended), you can shoot continuously with jpg. You need to be careful. With the 20D, it was easy to take single shots with the shutter in continuous shooting mode. With the 50D, the fast shutter will zip off numerous images with just a light touch.The 1.6 crop factor works in my favor when shooting distant subjects, making a 400mm lens an effective 640mm.

Continuous burst buffer is awesome, 6.3 pfs. With UDMA card I could shoot 19 frames straight before it slowed down. (RAW only not with JEPG.

Without exception, the 50D produces noticeably sharper and brighter images than both previous cameras. I have read some of the reviews here claiming poor quality and graininess at high ISO ratings, but I have yet to see anything be crisp shots even at 1600. I am using Canon 70-200mm f/4L, Tokina 20-35 ATX Pro, Carl Ziess Sonnar 135mm f/3.5, Asahi Pentax SMC Takumar 50mm f/1.4, Canon EF-S 18-55mm Rebel Kit lens, and a Canon EF 28-80mm f/2.8-4L USM (older L series glass). Each lens produced superior results using the 50D in every situation except using the cheap glass. The Rebel did best on the cheap glass, probably due to reduced megapixels, and the 50D and 40D were comparable.On the Auto Focus lenses, the low-light focus was far better lens-for-lens on the 50D especially with the assist from the 580 EX II on a flash shot. I did not expect the improvement in auto focus using the older lenses (such as the Tokina), but there it was. I also noticed about a full stop better in terms of exposure. I tested in Auto, AV and Manual modes. The 50D selected a faster shutter and ISO making the same shot using the same lens than did the 40D, and not surprisingly, the XTi.I am not a professional camera tester or review writer. I merely set up the same shot using a tripod and tested all three cameras on the same shot using the same lens, then I took a look in PhotoShop and decided which was best. I made 8 shots, 4 indoors and 4 outdoors, all using RAW mode except one shot using full auto. For the two flash shots I used a Speedlite 580 EX II so all three cameras had the advantage of a very good flash. The XTi, by the way, still did poorly even using the 580 EX II. It is just an awful indoor camera as far as I am concerned. But this review is about the 50D.The first shot was outdoors, afternoon light, wooded area where trees were clear of leaves, late fall in NC.

I adjusted only the aperture. On the 50D, I used f/8, on the 40D and had to open up to f/4 and on the Rebel I had to open up to f/3.5. to get the same exposure value in the meter. I spotted with my Gossen Luna Pro and got a recommended setting of f/4, so the 40D was not underperforming, but the 50D was excelling!I got similar results except in a low light interior shot without flash, I could not get the Tokina lens to focus in Auto mode using the Xti. The 40D churned a bit, but the 50D had no issues at all, it smoothly focused the lens. I manually set infinity before each shot, by the way.I can't find one thing about the 40D that I like more than the 50D. I am selling it to pay off the bill on the 50D and keeping the Xti as a lightweight backup camera (along with my beloved Elan IIe).In short, the results I found in manual mode were that on the 50mm I could stop down about *two full stops* using the 50D as compared the the 40D and the XTi. Strangely, I tried this one shot on my Elan IIe and it compared with the 50D! Film still rocks on some shots.Using the 70-200mm f/4L all three cameras performed well. The Xti required one stop wider on the same shots and produced a very grainy image at high iso (1600), but it is not a fair comparison. The 40D produced grainier images in every high-ISO shot.After conducting the comparison tests, I tried a low-end lens on the 50D, the 18-55mm EF-S Rebel kit lens. I noticed a lot more noise than I usually do with this lens. I reduced the size of the image to ~10MP to compare with the XTi and I still noticed a bit more noise. It does seem that the 50D is less forgiving of lower quality glass than the other two cameras, but the difference is not very noticeable unless the image is sized for 20x30 prints. One pass with the noise reduction filter cleared it up with very little loss of fidelity. My intended solution is to shoot with good glass.The M42 manual lenses with an EOS adapter do VERY well on this Camera. I have not \"learned\" their ranges on the 50D yet, so I shot in AV mode and had excellent, even outstanding, results. The 50D LOVES the Zeiss Sonnar. The color and sharpness were astounding with a bounced (75 degree) flash using the auto setting on the 580 EX II. Studio quality, seriously.Well, that's all I have to say except I am very happy with this Camera. Canon keeps moving the ball forward. I am saving up for the 5D Mark III, since I assume the Mark II will be replaced before I can afford it :D", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 50D", "Author": "T.

Most of my photography is done on adventure trips (Africa,Middle East, Thailand, etc).

It seems like a lock would be simple, but as I said this may just be me. I paired it with the Tamron VC digital zoom lens and feel that they pair well when such trips don't allow carrying extra equipment.Considering that the 50D was about $400 cheaper than my 20D if feel that this a real value for the quantum leap in resolution,onboard processing power, increased LCD size, sensor cleaner etc. I find that the larger LCD is great for viewing shots, but for someone who wears glasses really helps navigate thorough the menus.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera and all-around lens", "Author": "Mike G. \"Mike G.\"", "ReviewID": "R31P9YB0R4VG1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this camera for a little more than a month but this camera has proven to be great camera.

But my financial objectives are not the reason I'm writing about Canon 50D.But my financial objectives are not the reason I'm writing about Canon 50D.Since there are a plethora of articles already written about Canon's most recent EOS camera, I thought I'd point out some some function features of the camera that I have already found useful. Keep in mind, I've only had the camera less the 24 hours, but since this is my third Canon DSLR camera (in addition to owning the Canon Powershot G9), the features of this newest model are not foreign to me.If you do a quick Google search about the 50D, you'll see that many reviews rightly compare the camera to it's predecessor, the 40D. There have been mixed reviews about how much better the 50D is than the 40D. I won't get into that because I never purchased the 40D. But if you're a 20 or 30D owner like myself, stepping up to the either 40D or the 50D is almost a no brainer, especially if you're a serious amateur or professional photographer.The features of the 50D (which can also be said for the 40D) are very useful for shooters who take lots of pictures, especially in demanding situations. Canon has greatly streamlined the 50D, making controls and features easier to get at. And though image quality is of course primary in selecting a camera, the function features should not be overlooked. When you pay for a camera like this, you should definitely know and use all its features to your advantage.So here a list of my \"first impression\" features that I would like to share. As I get more time to play around the camera, I will try to share others.1. Custom Menu: The 50D comes with a feature called \"Registering My Menu\" (page 185 in the Manual) which enables you to create a set of six of your favorite or most used menu items. After you select and set up the items, you can push the Menu button on the back of the camera, and your custom set of menu items will be the first to appear. So for instance if you use the Format, Quality, and Auto Bracketing menu items a lot, they will be included in your custom set which means you don't have to scroll to get at them. This little feature doesn't have anything to do with quality photos, but it does save you scrolling and clicking time. (By the way, have you ever stopped and wondered how many times you click and scroll on your computer everyday? It's worse than changing channels on your television.)2. Auto Rotate: With my Canon Powershot G9, you can turn the camera in a vertical position and the image displayed will rotate into full screen viewing. When you tilt the camera back to horizontal position, the selected image will turn back to that position. It's totally sweet. Well, you can't do that with the 50D, and I'm bummed out about that. However, I did discover that you can turn off the auto rotation of vertical images on the 50D so that images will appear full screen in playback. You can do this so that the images only rotate on your camera and not on your computer. If you don't this, you simply don't get the full advantage of viewing your vertical images on the 3' screen. This is described on page 146 of the camera's manual.3. Quick Control Screen: Though I haven't used it much yet, I think I will like the Quick Control Screen feature of the camera. This feature displays camera settings on the LCD monitor. You can select items and change settings while viewing them in the monitor. This may prove quicker than viewing some of the exposure settings on the top side of the camera, or having to go into the menu and change settings there.4. Highlight Alert: I think all the digital EOS cameras have had a feature called Highlight Alert. When enabled, this alert (when viewing photos in playback) will point out areas of the selected image that are overexposed. Some camera users call this the \"blinkie\" feature. I used this feature all the time on the 30D, but you have to push the Info button to get at it, and the selected image in playback is almost thumbnail size, preventing you from getting good assessment of what is blown out. Well, that problem has been corrected in the 50D. Now you can get Highlight Alert while the image is played back in full screen mode. Totally lovely. Page 133 of the manual.5. Custom Mode Dials C1 and C2: Similar to the custom menu feature I discussed above, this feature allows you to register a set of camera settings (shooting mode, menus, etc.) as presets and dial them up anytime you like simply by turning to the C1 or C2 positions on the camera's mode dial (page 186 of the manual). I use this feature on my Canon G9 and it's great. I've read that the 40D has three, instead of just 2, of these preset positions. Canon took away one of the positions on the 50D and replaced it with what they call Creative Auto mode. I haven't played with that mode yet, so I can't say if it's worth getting rid of one of the positions. But I do know that once you get your camera presets the way you want, these C1 and C2 positions can be quite handy. You could for example, have one position set for shooting outdoor photos and another position set for shooting indoors. Perhaps I'll write more about this later in another blog entry.Well, that's my five function features that I like so far. I would have included the Live View feature in the list, but I haven't played around with it enough to like it. It's more clunky and difficult to use than on the G9, in which I use the Live View all the time.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Totally Satisfied with the Canon 50d", "Author": "Frank R.

But I was never totally satisfied with the 40d, so I took the plunge.  I can only say that I'm thrilled with the performance of the 50d compared to the 40d.  While I'm not prepared to go into a long detailed comparison, I will say that I find the image quality and the auto-focus accuracy of the 50d to be noticeably better than the 40d.

Just to let you know I am a serious amateur photographer who takes mainly landscape photo and sometimes portrait of my kids. My main lenses are: 50mm 1.4, 17-55mm 2.8 and kit lens (28-135mm).First of all, this is a good camera. Good in a sense than it is better than Nikon D90 for its ISO performance (low light), focusing, metering and shutter speed. It has ISO 100 which helps you to take long exposure picture. The CMOS crop sensor is as good as 7D and the only difference with 7D is metering system and megapixel. But believe me if you do not enlarge your photo more than 20\"X30\" you cannot see the difference AT ALL.Pros of this camera:1. Easy to handle. Ergonomic. If you use manual mode you will see how easy to dial the aperture and shutter speed.2. Good ISO performance. I took some star trail with iso 3200 and the noise still less.3. LCD screen amazing. Actually thats too good in my opinion.4. Two pre-seeting is very useful for some known conditions.5. Picture quality is very good if you have moderate lens.6. Shutter speed (6.3 fps)- very important if you take sports photo.Cons:1. LCD screen so good that you may think all your pics are good. Actually it may not be.2. Very dim view through viewfinder. Covers only 93%.3. Only 9 point metering compared to 7D's 21 point.Overall I should give a 5 star for the qaulity image I get for this price. My only reason giving is 4 star is crop sensor which is not necessarily any bad about this camera.

I spent 5 months reading every review I could find and visiting camera stores in each state I visited. I tested every model and brand out there and asked the opinions of various owners. I finally decided I liked the features of the Canon line. I waited for the 7D to hit the shelves and tried it out. I found that  the added features were great but more than I needed at this point with my DSLR experience. I decided to spend the money I saved on good glass. When the 50D arrived at my door I shot 300 photos the next day. The quality is superb. I love the sharpness and detail. With 15mp I can crop in close and still have sharp images. I opted to add the 70-300mm IS USM zoom to the 28-135mm kit lens and mounted on this camera I get the most beautiful nature photos. The kit lens has a bit of a cheap feel for an item carrying the canon nameplate but it takes nice photos. I still have a lot to learn. If you are fairly new to this level of camera the manual, while very detailed, will leave you needing more. I chose to buy the Canon 50D book by David Busch and it's like having an instructor walking you through the cameras abilities. I would recommend this camera to anyone. I am very pleased.

It is well designed and  I carry it all day in the woods without a strap.  2)  THe eyecup positions your face right on the LCD and the skins oils will end up on the  screen.

The 50D really shows off the superior lens and is an excellent DSLR--I have now owned it for several months and like it more than I did when I first starting using it. I love the way the 50D feel in my hands - solid and very tactile.  She's a keeper.  A very good value in my opinion for a camera that can deliver professional results.

Unfortunately the cost of film and film processing prevented me from really learning how to make use of the camera's full capabilities but the AE-1 was designed to also take excellent pictures easily even if one didn't know how to utilize all the features available in the camera.Once digital EOS cameras started being produced I knew I wanted one so I could experiment without the limitations of film costs. Unfortunately for many years, the high cost of digital EOS cameras prevented me from purchasing one. That is, until the year my wife and I got a fairly heft tax refund check from the IRS. I was planning on using it on bills (like we normally have done in the past) but my wife, tired of hearing me lamenting the fact that I couldn't afford a digital EOS camera, demanded I use the money to get one. After doing a lot of research I decided to stick with the Canon brand and get the 50D (at the time the newest camera on the market).I have now been using it for over two years and have not had any problems with it. I think it's an excellent camera for beginners as well as more experienced photographers and allows for a lot of experimentation with various settings. A newer camera has been recently released by Canon which seems to be getting mixed reviews. Hopefully the release of the newer Canon camera will cause the price on the 50D to drop somewhat.Definitely a camera I would recommend to family and friends.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Powerful camera for the consumer...", "Author": "TEA", "ReviewID": "RBV0NR035PSSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first SLR. Learning to use an SLR in general can be a little trying, but I found the 50d a pleasure to work with as got into the details of exposure settings.The 50d has prefab standard modes like what you find in point-in-shoots, but to really enjoy it, I found getting into its details critical.I found the following 50d books essential: Canon EOS 50D Digital Field Guide Magic Lantern Guides: Canon EOS 50D Multimedia WorkshopI consider the first book a must have, but I'd really not do without the second either. The second comes with two DVDs which contains classes, one specific to the 50D, and one generic about taking great digital photos.Things I really like:* Battery life lasts for a very long time. I have never been forced to recharge due to unexpected fast drainage, even after lots of usage.* A configurable menu: There's a menu which you can configure with your favorite menu options from other menus in the system. This makes one's fav options easy to access ASAP. I did not use this right away, but after learning more, and getting deeper into exposure settings, I found my own custom menu indispensible.* Two configurable modes: When going beyond automatic modes (the modes where you just point and shoot), you then get into what Canon refers to as the \"creative zone\" modes. These are modes which require more work on the part of the photographer because he/she must make choices where the camera will not be automatically handling things. The two configurable modes are like slots, where you can store particular settings you like. So if you're out one day, shooting, and you have one setting you like for photos in the sunlight, and another for those in the shade, you can store those settings so they can each be accessed quickly on the mode dial (a phyiscal dial on the camera).* Configurable buttons: Some of the buttons on the 50D can be reconfigured to control settings other than what they control by default. This can allow a user to reconfigure certain buttons/switches to one's liking. See the manual on the Canon 50D page for details.* This camera is FFFFFast, even when taking multiple photos. This just goes to say w/an SLR, but I was coming from a point-and-shoot and found the speed of this 50d amazing. I used to do long exposures with a point-and-shoot, and had to wait equal time for the cam to offload photos from fast memory to the slower memory stick. Assuming you have a decent flash card in the 50d, there's little wait, if any.I was perplexed by the SLRs out there, and I knew Canon was an excellent choice, so I liked what I'd seen with the 50d and just went for it. As a first time SLR user, I felt I could not go wrong with any of the major brands. I was right. So for a new SLR user, I'm not sure scrutinizing each detail of speed and capability is critical unless you can already foresee certain professional requirements. Any SLR will cause one to have to deal with typical SLR details (it can't be avoided if someone is learning), and that's what I wanted with my first SLR. The 50D gave me that and much more.I'm not an expert, but I like this camera, and I know it's definitely a great buy for someone who at least wants to enter into the world of SLRs.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "New to Photography", "Author": "P.

With that in mind I'll keep this brief.  My background: I'm an amature with a lot of SLR experience.  I started taking photography classes in high school...back when there were only film SLRs!.  Photojournalism was also my major for one year in college.  And since it's been an on and off hobby of mine.  I have a Canon SD 700 IS but this 50D was my first DSLR.Maybe it's because I work long hours and I'm not outside during the day, but most of my 50D photos so far have been in the late afternoon or evenings, or indoors.  As such I've used ISO 1600 quite a bit.  The images to my eye look fantastic!  Within the menu system there are High ISO Noise Reduction and Long Exposure Noise Reduection options that can be turned on/off as needed.If one is to compare image quality of the 50D to the 40D, I think it's interesting to remember the 50D takes larger, higher resolution images.  In other words, the 50D images start out with more detail.  And from the research I did it appears the 50D's images can be sharpened and still have more detail than the 40D.  There are good explanations of this on the web.  Amazon censored out the article links I included but if you contact me I'd be happy to provide them.Anyway, suffices to say I'm very happy with my 50D's IQ so far.  I also like it's super fast and accurate focusing!  I haven't used Live View very much but that feature has had its useful moments.  The LCD screen is gorgeous!  And the controls and menus are easy to navigate.  To be honest, they were a bit overwhelming the first couple days but then quickly became second nature.  I also bought Jeff Revell's Canon 50D: From Snapshots to Great Shots.  It's a \"beginner\" type book IMO, but still a good intro to this camera and a primer of DSLR basics if you're transitioning from film to digital like I was.I bought the 50D body only from Amazon and got the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras from Adorama; they matched the price and they've been very easy to work with.

Overall this is a nice camera. Noise level is indeed more than Nikon, my old D90 did some beautiful shots at high ISO where the 50D strugles. I would not go any higher than ISO 800 or so with this camera. Thing is I never do, so this is fine for me, but might be a problem for some.The button layout I would say could use some work. Nikon I would give a major advantage here as all there buttons are easy to get to and navigate, where the Canon I have to look and fumble around to find even the basic stuff. I admit allot of this has to do with me needing to needing to know the camera better and will improve over time, but the D90 I picked up in like 20 min of using. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Canon's is bad, but could use some more work is all.The camera is fast and starts up almost before I know I want to turn it on. (almost)Though I do feel Canon do need to add more AF points the nine it has seems to do the job well, even when following moving objects it keeps right up with it without a hint of wanting to slow down. Just make sure your memory card can keep up with this camera when your shutter is on auto fire. Like some reviews have stated, I have noticed the tracking does tend to want to go to brighter areas in the frame. This has not been a big issue with me, but is something you might want to watch for.Another thing I really like is the solid build. It feels like a tank and knowing that metal and weather seal will keep this running long after I should of stopped shooting and had put it away. Nothing on this camera feels weak.I was worried about soft images, though it is not a problem for this camera. Yes, if your using lower price glass you may see some softness, but this is not the camera doing it. With the 28-135 lens I got some pretty sharp shots with it and think its a good basic Lens, Yes my Primes (I like my primes) do better, but did enjoy using the lens on this camera for simple walks when I only wanted one lens with me and nothing else. Also I have noticed that this camera has no image overlay or multiple exposure settings. These are common on Nikon cameras, even there cheaper models, and I find it upsetting that there not on this camera. Yes you can do these in photoshop, having CS4 this is not a problem, but I prefer to do things in camera and only use PS for minor tweaks and adjustments. Canon really needs to add these.At the price right now I would have to say this camera is a steal and a better deal over the 7D which really does not add much. I might take a stronger look after a price drop or two but right now this is a much better deal and I think anyone looking for a good buy on a SLR built as strong and performs as fast and accurate would be happy with buying the 50D.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Get the best camera for your money", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"S Klein\"", "ReviewID": "R3MO0LC23HQCIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We did a Wedding with our new camera and the results are fantastic.

It is nice that photographers graduating from the 20D up through the series to the 50D can still use the same batteries and chargers on this latest model.My one little complaint is that Canon still hasn't found a way in this model series to move the \"depth of field preview\" button to the right side of the lens mount so that it can be easily accessed by a finger on the shooting (right) hand.  Doing so eliminates the necessity for moving either hand from their normal shooting positions to check depth of field.

This cam focuses fast and quiet, not to mention its unbelievable 6.5 fps.Some cameras become legends and high points of achievement and it feels like this one is such a cam.As to me there's no reason for a higher pixel count, because it allows printing for practically any size that photo printers allow with pixel-to-pixel precision. I also had my hands on Sony A900 that is terrific camera in every way but it is much pricey and I already prefer smaller sizes and weights that associated with 24x16mm sensors.This camera married with Canon's terrific 17-55 2.8 zoom produces images of stupendous quality.I don't shoot much of action photography but overall responsiveness, instant readiness of this camera is very satisfying.

The EOS 50D was just released in October. I purchased it and have been using it for one month now. The 50D is just like my now retired 10D but with a few upgrades.One significant upgrade is the larger LCD display. It is crisp and sharp and easy to review images captured. While I do like the larger LCD display, there is a downside to the larger LCD display. I have found that my face inevitably touches the LCD display while looking through the viewfinder. This almost always leaves facial marks (oils) much like fingerprints all over the left side of the LCD display. I now find I must keep at-the-ready a soft, clean cloth to wipe it clean to review images clearly. While this is not necessarily a hardware issue, it is becoming somewhat of a major annoyance--especially when on a fast-paced photo shoot. Of course, unless one is as particular about a clean LCD display as I am, it might not be an annoyance. Perhaps Canon could consider moving the LCD display to the right side vs the left in later models.Another significant upgrade is the better image quality versus my former 10D. The images are now taken at 15.5 mega pixels versus the 6.3 of my former 10D. This alone made my purchase a worthwhile upgrade from the 10D.I have also noticed a noticeable difference with the 50D to capture a bit sharper images in low or available light situations. While the difference I have noticed is not always a sure thing in every situation, it is noticeable enough that it can often mean the difference between a \"keeper\" and a deletion. Fuzzy images in low light was a major issue with my former 10D. The sensors in the 50D appear to have been improved markedly.While the Canon EOS 50D can certainly over-kill for a novice or a point-and-shoot photographer, it does meet all of the quality standards and versatility requirements that I require as an advanced photographer. Whether used fully automatic or manually, this camera has all the technology I need to keep it from becoming a technical drag on my creativity. I consider myself an artist with a camera, not a technician. So, once I learn most of the camera's features, I make the camera work for me, not against me. That's everything a Twenty-First Century digital camera should be. And, the Canon EOS 10D certainly is.While the Canon EOS 50D is not a radical upgrade over more recent Canon digital SLRs, it is for my former 10D. Therefore, I am delighted with my new 50D and would readily recommend it as a quality new or replacement digital camera for any serious photographer.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera, super customer service", "Author": "R.

This thing is a joy to use and the image quality is amazing, I actually found this easier to use than my 2 other Canon PS (shooting manual, that is).--------------------------------------------------------------------------After checking out the camera, I found that there's a lint on the focus plate that would not go away, it does not affect the picture but annoy the hell out of me.

It was between the Nikon D90 and the Canon 50D for me, since I plan to use the camera on a trail taking pictures of wild life and birds, I think the Canon 50D will serve me better.

And the 40D was already out of stock, but that would certainly fill all my needs.Anyway, about the Canon EOS 50D...Construction is so solid that makes Rebels look like toys. The feel is comfortable - better grip action requires no battery grip, the weight, and the leather finish avoids slippering.I think the top panel is better than LCD controls. Saves battery life, is not as luminous as the LCD, makes your action more discreet (the quieter shutter also helps).The shutter should last longer, since its a more advanced body.Viewfinder is brighter, focusing and shooting (burst) is much faster.The ISO in thirds is great. It makes your exposures perfect, even if you shoot Jpeg.There are two things I don't like about this camera: the size of the files, and the Live View.15 megapixel is too much for the majority, professional or not. The cards must be huge if you shoot RAW on a social event. Processing them now takes longer with this 15Mb average RAW files. I'd stick to the 10/12 megapixels.And the Live View feature, according to the manual, can decrease picture quality in some situations. Also, if used to shoot a bright scene, it may damage the curtains/sensor (can't remember now). I rather not to use Live View at all, and never needed - the AF always worked, even on dark situations with the EF 17-40 f/4L USM lens, a relatively dark lens.Never used a FF camera, but seems to be a step closer to that.I recommend the 50D and would buy it again!", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Still the best small body DSLR today", "Author": "B.

That was my first camera, and I loved it. I intermediately tried a Nikon D90, owing to its apparently great noise performance and the punchy color rendition... only to realise Nikon lags a bit in LiveView implementation which was better even in an XSi.So I ordered a Canon 50d, hoping to get the liveview I wanted, PLUS a noise performance better that even the Nikon D90 (rival?).Now by this time I had tried a 450d and a Nikon D90.. and so I was surprised to find out that 50d nowhere matched noise performance of a cheaper Nikon D90! And I am not talking about per pixel performance.. I am talking about day-to-day indoor shooting results. Canon 50d images had a lot of chroma noise for same shooting conditions. I wont go into why the 50d images look so soft at pixel level.. because different people have different theories about that. But if end result is what matters, here are my 2 cts as an enthusiast photographer who also works in imaging field:- Canon 50d results can not match the Nikon D90 ones in colors (and YES I did struggle with the picture style editor - its not a simple linear transformation to go from Canon's RAW color space to Nikon's color space)- Nikon D90 allowed me to capture sharp indoor pictures in room lighting with minimal noise as compared to the Canon 50d. And I have images to compare.. not 1 or 2.. but hundreds.In the end, I realised that a better Canon 50d liveview may perhaps help me in technically getting good pictures... but a Nikon D90 gives me the end results that I love.. and love going back to look at. The difference is very subjective.. and has more to do with aesthetics than the technicalities. You have to go through both the cameras to understand that.Pros for a Canon 50d:- Solid built- 15 MP (do they matter anymore?)- Great dial interface- Bright hi-resolution LCD, with 30fps live view- The lens-specific auto-focus micro-adjustment feature is cool. I actually needed to use it with the first lens I purchased: A Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 which was terribly off-shooting.. by about 17 units (as seen on the calibration screen). However, I wasn't too sure I needed that feature.. since I am not a professional.Cons of a Canon 50d:- Noise performance isn't comparable to even cheaper models like Nikon D90. And no matter what you say about in lab tests and technical data, its the end result that matters. And I couldn't get the same results from a 50d that I could from a D90. Read more about independent noise tests on imaging-resource here: [...] Search for \"50D vs D90 Comparison\".- Very hard to get the punch out of the colors using just the picture style editor. The color transformations are unitary...you cannot rotate the whole color wheel or work on big sections of the color spectrum all at once.- Heavy. And I mean HEAVY with a good size lens.- A tad big for me.- PRICEY!!In summary:- if you have ~$1500 to spare for a new camera+lens kit (as of 1/27/2009),- if you like post processing to get the colors/shades you want- if you are a pro photographer with established liking for Canon's image quality- if you have a Canon 30d or below and have existing sizeable investment in Canon lenses,then Canon 50d is for you.If, however, you already own a Canon 40d, I dont think just extra MP and a brigher LCD will do you any good from a 50d. Plus a 40d may serve you equally or even better in terms of performance.Remember, there are always alternatives like the Nikon D90. And for $1500 (as of Jan 27, 2009), you can even get a 70-300mm VR lens with a basic 18-105 kit lens. It is a wonderful kit for an intermediate dSLR enthusiast.Whichever way you decide, I wish you luck in that you enjoy your purchase!Edited 03/24/2009: I have since tried a Canon 40D along with a Nikon D90. And comparing just the RAW images, my impression is that Canon 40D gives sharper and more detailed results compared to the Nikon D90.. given similar lenses and lighting conditions. The D90, however, has at least 1 stop advantage in usable ISO range, and has the vivid blues/greens in off the camera images that some people like.I can thus comfortably recommend a Canon 40D over the 50D, and along a Nikon D90. Reasons? Cheaper than a 50D, same price as a D90 (as of 3/24/09). Also, pro level Nikon glass is much more expensive than the Canons. Compare a 24-70 f2.8 or a 70-200 f2.8 between the two brands.In case you do decide to get a Canon 40D, you may want to check out my post on how to get Nikon like colors off a Canon40D here: prashchopra.blogspot.com/2009/03/getting-nikon-vivid-colors-from-canon.html .Good luck!", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect for all conditions", "Author": "Captainsteve", "ReviewID": "R147EZYJT7MQIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for two years now and its perfect in everything I use it for, just outstanding images!", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon 50D", "Author": "froggy23", "ReviewID": "R35AUPYILDAF0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

The one thing that could be better is the editing software that comes with it could be more user friendly and have more options to it.

Now that I've had time to play around and really use it I can here is my review.Canon 50DI purchased the camera without the kit lens and opted for the 50mm 1.8 II instead. I wanted something fun to play around with and with faster glass I wouldn't have to push the ISO too high. I also bought the grip which I don't ever want to take off. It really gives the camera a good feel. I had made the trip to a camera store before to check out which camera fit me the best. I was tempted to get the t1i but the Rebel series feels like a toy in my hands. I have smaller hands too but I just didn't like anything the Rebel line had to offer.I've shot with a SLR before. My first camera was an older Nikon N6006 that my dad got for me. I ended up going Canon because reading over the features for the price range and available glass, Canon seemed like the best choice to me.Since owning the camera I have also purchased a 580EX II. This is probably the best purchase I have made for this camera. Having this will open up a whole new world of photography for you. The onboard flash is simply, well, useless.I ended up buying a 18-55mm IS lens also. The 50mm on a crop like the 50D is good for portraits but you have to step back a bit to get someone completely in a picture.My two complaints are as follows:1. Noisy at higher ISO's. Not as bad as my G10 so I can deal with it but I wish there was a little bit better performance.2. The grip has no AF-On button so you have to reassign it to the *. This isn't a huge deal but it's something that was overlooked when they designed the grip.Overall I'm very happy with the camera and glad I ended up picking it.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent value", "Author": "lenonline", "ReviewID": "RUZRMB20MVA4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is FAST.

It has been flawlessly reliable, producing many thousands of images over the past 18 months. As a frequest shooter of motor sports, the fast focus and quick motor drive make shooting on-track action a joy. However, I also shoot \"salon\" work - posed pictures of classic cars - and some glossy, high-end magazines (rightly or wrongly) are demanding I send them huge files if I want the cover...Enter the 50D.With it's 50% larger Megapixel count when compared to the 40D, the RAW files are much bigger and more impressive to my editors. Recently, I shot a Ferrari event and because the best shots (salon immages) were shot RAW (making TIFF files of nearly 50MB) the chairman of the show wants to use one of my images for next year's poster. A compelling reason for the purchase and justifies the purchase of the camera on its first assignment.ASIDE - If you are a digital shooter, you know that you can get very large blow ups from relatively small files - I have a professionally printed 20X30 print I shot as a JPEG on a 6 MP camera. I used good technique (exposure, composition) and great glass(seriously expensive pro glass). It has been used on a magazine cover and is a great action shot of a Porsche airborn at a race track. But, being in the business and not the hobby of photography, I have to give my editors what they ask for and with the 50D, I can out-megapixel (almost) anybody on the staff.But the performance of the 50D is much more than megapixel count. It has great autofocus speed. Exposure in P mode (program) works best for me in fast moving situations although you always have to think about scenes where very light or very dark sections dominate the frame (the 18% reflectance rule still applies) and you should manually compensate to prevent blown highlights or all black shadows. Go back to what you learned in Photo 101 if I lost you.More on the features - I especially love the rear view screen. It is much brighter and sharper than the 40D's and on par with similar priced and higher priced cameras from Nikon. The 50D uses the fast-write Compact Flash cards so you can pump a lot of images onto the buffer when shooting at 6+ FPS.I added the Canon grip which allows me to have 2 batteries on board. I have shot many hundreds of non-flash images and so far, I have never exhausted the battery (I use an external flash and not the amateur-oriented pop-up which helps). The grip also allows me to use AA batteries if the rechargable ones poop out.The camera seems to be very well sealed against dust and moisture - important since road course auto races run rain or shine.Finally, counting cool features is for gadget guys, the important results are in the quality of the pictures. In that arena, frankly, the 50D flat out delivers. I think it produces pro-quality images (assuming good quality - AKA \"L\" - glass is used) and so far, my editors seem to agree.I am not selling my 40D yet and continue to use it as a backup camera. But when the assignments demands big files and a chance to score a cover or a double-page spread, I will always reach for the 50D.For any Canon pro shooters out there - consider joining CPS - Canon just recently changed the program for the better and I recommend it highly.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "EOS 50D", "Author": "SJE", "ReviewID": "R27Y66RVF2GOB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom LensI purchased this product as a replacement/addition for/to my 2005 Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT, which I was using in dusty and wet environments.

I had decided that the 50D canon was going to be what I wanted due to the fact that I completely wore out my previous camera, a Canon D60, and had sold my backup camera.My purchase was from a fellow photographer that had listed his nearly new 50D and I was actually able to speak to him on the phone about this sale. I was very pleased with, and confident that this would be a smooth transaction.j. michael brookssee...[...]", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "50D as a Pro tool", "Author": "Digiphotoshop \"Digiphotoshop\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZSSZ7IHB47AJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A DSLR can provide a lot of benefits over a simple point and shoot camera. With a DSLR, you'll get faster shooting speeds, better optics (and therefore a better quality picture), the ability to change lenses for ultimate flexibility, complete control over image exposure, sharpness, other image quality settings and a lot more.Like many products, there are entry-level DSLRs, professional-grade D-SLRs, and plenty of models in between. Canon's 50D blurs the line between amateur and professional D-SLR cameras. This camera strikes a good balance with its price and feature set. With the 50D, you get a lot of features you wouldn't find on entry-level models such as Superior burst speed 6.3fps, weather sealed body, All nine autofocus points on the 50D are of the cross type variety, while on the T1i / 500D, only the center one is, Maximum shutter speed of 1/8000s, White balance in Kelvin, The viewfinder in the 50D uses a pentaprism while a pentamirror is used for the viewfinder in the 500D. Pentaprism viewfinders give a brighter and larger image compared to pentamirror types. But you won't pay professional-grade prices. Users who are just making the jump to a DSLR, for example will appreciate the 50D's Live View mode, which lets you use the DSLR's LCD to frame an image, similar to the way you would frame an image using a point and shoot camera. For more advanced shooters, the 50D also has full manual controls to give you all the traditional adjustments in image staging for your photographs.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "SUPER CAMERA", "Author": "CHARLOTTE TRUELOVE \"REALTOR\"", "ReviewID": "R1J5B2NVSSNFG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS CAMERA HAS PROVEN TO BE A WONDERFUL CAMERA.

One example is that while in some of these modes you cannot disable the flash.  Another is that the color temperature cannot be adjusted in certain modes.My opinion is that it would be beneficial if these modes were expanded such that more of the camera's available features could be adjusted while in the the Exposure Control modes designed for new users.  Additionally it would be nice if each one of these modes were allowed to be adjusted and saved independently.  Perhaps a \"Factory Default\" - \"Sports\" mode (A) which cannot be edited and then additional customizable \"Sports\" modes versions (B,C,D,E,F) each of which is essentially the factory default mode but with user overrides.

My verdict: If you have the 30D, feel free to upgrade as for good lighting, you'll be quite happy.  If you have the 40D, don't upgrade. You may regret it.Pro's:- AF-Microadjustment - I LOVE this feature!  You can now manually calibrate your lenses to the body without shipping them all to Canon. NICE!- Weather sealing (not sure just how much).- Live View - Was great for taking pictures over a fence that I could not see over.- LCD resolution and bright! (NOTE: It's incredible until you put a screen protector over it. Fellowes-brand LCD screen protectors that I've been using drop the resolution because of the adhesive they use.  Others may be OK.)- Fast and quiet shutter.- 15 megapixels, for better crop options.- Many other features beyond the 30D, but not necessarily the 40D.Con's:- Higher ISO noise than 40D/30D. Honestly, ISO 6400 with extreme noise reduction is usable for publishing to Web after some extreme noise reduction in Photoshop. ISO 12,800 is pointless unless it's the only way you can capture the Flying Saucer. Everyone seems to agree that the ISO levels for the 50D is all marketing and has little to do with usability. However, ISO 3200 is a little better than 30D, but not as smooth as the 40D.- Hot pixels in high ISO - pretty bad, actually in low light. I agree with those who state Canon would probably have been better off making this a 12.x megapixel camera on an APS-C sized sensor.- AF Servo slower with longer lenses; this may be an issue with mine, but the AF Servo mode seems sluggish in some cases when compared to the 30D. I normally shoot indoor sports with a Canon 70-200mm/2.8L IS lens, and it does grab better shots normally on the 30D because of the faster AF-Servo.  Not sure what could be causing this--There is a little note in the manual stating that the AF-Microadjustment feature may hinder proper AF (or along that line of thought)--maybe they state this in case we don't know how to use the AF-Microadjustment correctly.- New RAW format (and Adobe Lightroom 1.x is useless unless you add Canon's DPP to your workflow to pre-convert everything for LightRoom.) Maybe this has to do with the new DIGIC IV processor, which I don't believe improves the pictures beyond the 30D/40D, except that it is adding more handling and noise reduction to the 15 megapix sensor.Summary - there are some cool features with this camera, and if you need that faster shutter speed for indoor sports, and the only way to get it is to get a higher ISO, this unit isn't the pits.  But I find that I'm better off using ISO 3200 on the 30D and bringing up the RAW exposure in Lightroom instead.  I am personally disappointed with the 50D in low light, but Canon made a valiant attempt to compete with Nikon.  I just feel it's a hasty effort and not the quality product it should be.

I replaced the battery with another. That appeared to be dead too. I replaced the CF card and the battery, and the camera wouldn't power up. I tried five Canon batteries (not knock-offs)and they were all dead. The 50D didn't show an error message, it showed nothing. I removed everything, including the internal battery and \"rebooted\" the camera. I put a fully charged battery in and the camera powered up. I shut it down, put in a CF card, the camera wouldn't turn on.  I cannot believe this. I went on line to blogs and posts regarding camera's and found another individual who experienced the same exact problem. I wrote to Canon and, as has been the case in the past, they tell me \"they have no knowledge of such problems in their products.\" (This was the same response to the 20D problems for which I found several blogs and postings which described multiple Canon users having the same problem.Once again I will be packing up a high priced camera and sending it in to Canon repair (conveniently located in Jamesburg New Jersey...despite the fact that their headquarters is here in Lake Success on Long Island.I am astonished that I could possibly buy TWO LEMONS from Canon?Truthfully, my brother has the comparable Nikon and he has had no such problems. Moreover, my employer has purchased a total of 350 Nikon's and they haven't had a \"lemon ratio\" as I have had with Canon.When it works its a great camera, but when it doesn't...it's a nightmare that seems to be beyond Canon's ability to repair. Be cautious. It's a lot of money to chance. I feel like an idiot for giving Canon the second chance.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "B. K. Money \"MommyBBB\"", "ReviewID": "R334L50BKQLKM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera recently as an upgrade for my Rebel XS. The only problem I have is the CF card. It seems so antiquated, even though the camera was brand new out of the box. The Rebel (bought in 09) had an SD card. So I assumed that this had a SD card as well. Duh. My own Stupidity for not seeing it clearly listed on the specs. I think I didn't pay attention to it because I was so overwhelmed by the full frame sensor and then I always wanted a lens that had a longer focal length.  I have an 18-55mm lens and then I have a 55-250mm and a 70-300mm lens... and a 50mm prime lens... Just needed something in the middle. I honestly have not spent as much time as I would like to using the camera as it is currently winter, dreary, and boring. But on one extraordinary day, we had temperatures in the 60's and the sun was shining, and we ventured to the park. I was able to take the most beautiful photos of my kids. Another day I took photos at the Atlanta Aquarium. I have pics I will upload of huge manta rays flying over our heads, with very little chromatic aberration. I shoot in manual (self taught) and the plan was to then edit my photos in photoshop. Just with being so busy, I actually havnt sat down and taught myself photoshop yet, as well as the pictures are so beautiful, straight out of the camera, that it hasn't become an absolute necessity. Yet. I used to shoot in RAW +L which is your CR2 and a large jpg on the Rebel but the RAW file sizes on this 50D are so huge (20mb+) and since I am not editing in them Photoshop. I have become lazy and just switched back to large jpg format. Which is fine since I am just a mommy with a camera and not a professional. I can not wait for this spring with kids down at the river, toes against smooth pebbles, ripples in the water, and the perfect photo opportunity. Used this camera recently with a generic Bower hotshoe flash (Of course I want a Speedlite), and it worked perfectly. What I love the most is the F stop control is a dial situated on the back of the body. Where as the shutter speed dial is another dial located close to the shutter release on the front. The camera is very heavy. So if you have carpal tunnel (which I do suffer from) you may be a bit sore after toting this beast around. Sore that is, until you see how beautiful your photos are. Then you couldn't care less.

This was my first IS lens and I kept getting horrible photos and wondering what in the world.  Just a note-IS is not for moving subjects so that was simply user error.  After correcting that I have a few complaints.  Like others have noted, my photos sometimes seem soft, even when they are actually in focus.  It's really weird.  Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't.I was adjusting my focal points and finding that after snapping the picture, the LCD screen was showing me red pixels in the exact same spot that the focus point was.  I didn't take my card out to see if this carried over into a print, but it definitely had me worried.  I ended up just restoring original camera settings and the problem was fixed.

It is my first owned DSLR but I have had some before like the EOS REBEL, 20D, 30D, 40D and 5D. Compared side to side with the 5D they look and they behave similar.I think it is more like the big pro cameras than the Rebels.First of all, the size and weight. This camera is heavier and can be tricky for small hands.I was invited to an event on the press area and took my place and found that some pro users and reporters use this same camera with an L Series lens. It behaves great!If you are planing on buying a DSLR I think the Rebel is good choice, but the 50D asures a longer life and a more resistant body and of course more shots due to the use of stronger materials.I am not a pro but I can do pro jobs any time.The lens is a good lense compared to an L series lens. My budget was limited and I choose to invest in the body and a basic lens, then in the future I can work my way to a better lens. I found a little bit of a problem in low light conditions even at high ISO. The combination of high ISO and low light gives noisy images, but in daylight you do not have a problem. It is a fairly made lens, that I think will last several months in medium use. But I feel it can give you a headache unexpectedly if you have pro assignments. I had to choose between basic body with better lens (Rebel) or better boddy with basic lens (this one).By this day the EOS 7D has seen the marketplace and priced a little bit higher.

As my research began, an interesting fact popped up to give me some skepticism about making the 50d my choice. One of them was that thru reading other reviews there was information offered that the new Raw file from the 50d could not be read by various softwares. As a user of Apple and Aperture this gave me great concern.Yesterday I woke up and slowly made my way passed my cup of coffee and over to my Mac. After firing it up and logging in I notice there was a software update available. When I read the details, low and behold it was a Aperture update enabling it to read the new Raw files being captured by the 50d, and other Nikon, olympus, sony and other DSLR's. I accepted the download and went and got dressed.Took a little drive up to the local garden variety Camera/photo national franchise chain to develop some prints, and asked it they had a 50d. sure enough they did. Luckily I had grabbed a CF card and stuck it in my pocket before heading out. The gentleman behind the counter offered me the camera and let me slap the Cf card in and play with it for awhile.What they say is true. The controls are a lot different. Still the same type fit and finish of the typical Canon offerings.  However, within 5-10 minutes or so the controls had been mastered. I like the new controls. there are too many to go into details, but suffice it to say that I have made the decision to make the 50d my new workhorse. Of course there is still the lingering question of figuring out how and where to get the funds for the transaction. At approx. $1399 it is a good value based on the overall features and also considering what we have been paying for previous generation DSLR technology.Later, when at home i had the chance to review the RAW files on Aperture which were taken with the 50d. Crisp, clean, good color, just what we have come to expect from Canon. Something worth noting is that the file size shot in the full size RAW mode was 20MB+, so the mac and Aperture was laggin a little. The camera has three Raw sizes to choose from however. Personally i would mailnly shoot in the middle (7.1 mp mode) most of the time. Having the 15.1 mp RAW capability feature is a tremendous tool to be able to work with.Getting my hands on one made all the difference and it is my humble opinion that the 50d is a solid offering and a strong value. All things considered I will probably be purchasing one within the next 60 days or so.

Why do I say this?First, it's not at all weatherized, which does matter to me as I do mostly outdoor shooting, and there are competing products from Nikon, Pentax, Sony, that are pretty well weatherproof.Second, the viewfinder is small and dark, and there's only 9 AF points, compared to 50 something in the Nikon D300, and at least 11 in most other cameras. I don't need 50 points, but the little rhomboid pattern in the Canon amateur and prosumer lines is really sub-par for the industry.Third, there's more pixels, but then there's also more noise, and fewer pixels would have been just fine, along with less noise. What good does ISO 12800 do, when the pic is unusable?In summary, Canon has been resting on their laurels, made mainly cosmetic improvements in each iteration since their 20D came out, and I sold the camera a month after I bought it at a substantial loss on ebay.

So I see nearly every model of camera, especially Canon and Nikon ones beacuse they are so popular.  I must say 50D is not a good decision for Canon user. Although its spects seems better than 40D or 500D the usage isnt that way. There is so many thing can be said but I'll only say one important thing.  It gives realy realy soft images. Its details is realy soft that even some of the 12 MPx cameras gives better image qualty and detail. I advise you give more or less money but prefer an other model.D preview also said what I told you:\"The EOS 50D has a three megapixel advantage over the D300 but again this does not translate into a larger amount of detail. In fact the D300 actually manages eke out a little more detail in some areas of the image. To be fair this is helped by a little bit of extra sharpening and, while it doesn't reveal any discernible extra detail, the 50D responds well to a mild unsharp mask as well. Overall however there's not a huge amount between these two cameras and certainly in print it would be very difficult to pick a clear winner.\"", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sounds Great 50D", "Author": "KO \"owner\"", "ReviewID": "R1VCI6L3H27P81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Jodi-Ann Richards, for such a detailed review on the Canon DSLR 50D. I am looking at buying a DSLR, and have my 'eye' on all the newest models.I have a Canon Film SLR Rebel Ti, and have read reviews for the Xsi and the new Rebel Ti1 and other DSLRs with Nikon and Canon. I have been very happy with Canons, and the 50D sounds treamedous and very clear image quality at 15.1 megapixels. I have a photography blog online, and have had photos published in magazines and calendars. I mostly take photos of landscapes, nature, travel, scenery, portrait, pets, etc.I have read many positive and a few negative reviews about the 50D, and it sounds tremendous. I have also researched the Canon 5D Mark II, but the price bracket seems very expensive.I have 2 Canon EF lens, a 90mm and a telephoto 300mm, and consider myself as a semi-professional photographer; by no means a beginner. Would the 50D be the 'best' choice?Although the price seems high, reading other reviews, it has been highly rated, and sounds fantastic. I also have a Canon power-shot A650 and that takes clear photos, and I like that for \"get up and go\", however am looking at replacing my film SLR. Do you know of any photography stores in Canada, who offer a trade up-upgrade?", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT", "Author": "Renee Pair", "ReviewID": "R25YFFVRATP9K3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This company was great.

I settled upon the Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Std Zoom Lens kit and made my purchase.  I hope this will become a very satisfying camera.  I think that the kit zoom lens offers an ideal focal length range for everyday, \"walk-about\" use.This is my first DSLR, and I received it on 11/12/08.The Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Std Zoom Lens was defective.The zoom ring spins freely as gravity takes the zoom barrel of the lens from 28mm out to 135mm anytime the camera is (even slightly) pointed downward.  I call Canon hoping that they will send me a replacement (new and perfect lens) lens and I can send them this lemon.Canon doesn't \"roll\" like that, and they only offer to repair the brand new lens at a factory service facility.  Canon advises that I seek resolution with my dealer.Amazon customer care was fantastic and shipped a replacement kit immediately; I received the replacement kit on 11/19/08.The lens in the replacement kit Amazon sent is no better than the first lens.After some Internet searching, I discover that this phenomenon is known as \"zoom creep\".  (so much for carefully shopping and weighing)  I would characterize the two lenses I received as being afflicted with zoom run.  Their zoom ring functions were both extremely sloppy and Lucy Goosy.  The ring itself was not problematic in its rotational travel, the lens zoom function was ridiculously loose, at the mercy of gravity.While this issue does not have any effect on the optical quality of the lens or images it certainly does not feel like precision optics to me.  Canon Technical Support says that with the image stabilization, the auto-focus, and the particular design of the zoom mechanism in this model lens, there is some inherent looseness, but that what I am describing is not at all \"normal\".I decided that I was not interested in playing the replacement and return game with Amazon, in search of the perfect lens that I had bought.I sent the original Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera w/EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Std Zoom Lens kit back to Amazon at a cost of $35.00 with insurance.Throughout the sordid affair, I had been calling Canon Technical Support.  To their credit, they have been very courteous and accommodating.  Yeah, I would like them to send me the perfect lens that I have already bought, but, as I said, they can't do that.Beaten like a rented mule, once I finally succumbed to the inevitable, Canon Technical Support did supply me with a prepaid UPS shipping label to send my brand new and second defective Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens to their Irvine, CA Service Center.Since I did not budget for any additional lens(es) with my purchase, I am waiting for my new and defective lens to be repaired and returned.Although my excitement has been tempered (yeah, ya think?), I look forward to the day when I can take pictures with my new camera.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not a camera review.", "Author": "S.
