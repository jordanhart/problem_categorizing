Great camera and package included everything I needed to use for compact camera use when not carrying my Nikon SLR. Focus Camera offered this very complete package.  Very pleased.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal on a great Camera!", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R1SWM7TEN0VH2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice setup, most stores don't carry this camera so you end up having to order it.  May as well get a good deal here at Amazon.  The camera didn't appear to be factory sealed, but it works perfect and is a great camera.  I filmed a concert up close in low lighting and it came out great!", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera was perfect but the bundle had a few items missing", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R323I84HYJ8SW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a gift to my daughter. She loves it but has used it only a few days. She was impressed with all the extra items the bundle contained.I chose this rating because I bought the camera bundle primarily for the memory card. It had a few items missing but it wasn't too serious. The memory stick reader was not enclosed but a lens cap retainer was. The camera has no lens cap so the retainer is unnecessary. The lens cleaner was in a separate pouch and had broken probably due to the flimsy plastic bottle. This caused the cleaner to damage the viewfinder protectors. I bought two of the the missing/damaged items for about $20. I didn't buy the bottle of lens cleaner. About 1/3 was left in the bottle.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "pricey camera but worth it", "Author": "gharib \"v.g\"", "ReviewID": "R3OBQXKTIB51I3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love the camera. Its awesome. From the accessories I like the batteries although they are not original Sony and the SD card is worth the holes price and the mini tripod are fine too.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Douglas", "ReviewID": "RCH6383STJROZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This bundle comes with lots of stuff! What I like the most were the two extra batteries plus charger, the tripods and the SD card. But I didn't like the lens cleaner fluid, for it seems to make my lens even dirtier! The camera itself is great, although I found it a bit heavy and bulky to go into a pocket. The wi-fi function that allows you to view/control the camera from your smartphone is awesome.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small, prosumer camera with astounding low-light performance...", "Author": "electron_plumber", "ReviewID": "RZ745WUNOTQXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually use a DSLR, but needed to pack light for a week of hiking/biking. This camera easily fit in my pocket - it's much smaller than any interchangeable lens system camera. The image quality is outstanding for a camera of this size. Although I missed my telephoto lens, I found that there are enough pixels that I can crop in quite a bit, and still have a very respectable image. That said, the most amazing feature of this camera is the low light performance. This is the first pocketable camera I've seen that has true DSLR-level low-light capability. In fact, it worked significantly better than my DSLR in many cases, thanks to clever multi-shot processing. I took many pictures in very dim, indoor mood lighting situations, without flash, and it just worked...As for the accessories, the card works well. The camera battery life is so long, I haven't yet needed to use the spare batteries. The case was useful - I found that the extra batteries fit in well with the camera. I received a different USB card reader, and it feels very solid compared to others I have used.One negative - the screen scratched very easily. And one wish - I'd love a waterproof version!", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Andrew E. Lee \"incontrovertible wunderkind\"", "ReviewID": "R3FEZ2XBXJSBZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great camera.  It really is.  It's no DSLR but for a point-and-shoot, it's the best I've used.  The auto-focusing can be arbitrary in the dark so beware.  Also, the video's not working properly.  There are vertical lines during movement.  I may have to get that checked.Also, much kudos to the seller for the package deal.  To be honest most of the extra stuff is useless.  The microfiber cloth piles and fuzzes leaving behind tiny fuzz balls; the strap is ugly and feels cheap; the dust brush sheds...  But for the extra batteries and the SD card alone makes it more than worth its money.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great pocket camera", "Author": "Andrew Miller", "ReviewID": "R2KZ7SD90IQ4IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great so far.  It works great in low light and is very pocketable.  This was my biggest concern, I have been missing lots of photos when I can't/won't lug my DSLR.  The quality certainly is not as good as my Canon 5dm2, but for such a small package it is quite impressive.The kit itself has a bunch of stuff you'll never need  (Two mini tripods?  A hand strap that is bigger than the camera?) plus some very helpful ones (extra batteries + charger, 64G SD card)", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great machine :)", "Author": "Rodrigo Murta", "ReviewID": "R3KCFLGMG8AC8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a simple, compact, very porwerful camera. it takes awesome pictures and fit in your poket.
