As for the camera itself we LOVE it!  Not since back in the 70's when everyone had a 35mm have we enjoyed using a camera.  We've had a lot of point and shoot digital camera and have been pleased, but they don't match up to this camera.  It was worth getting the package deal and the Nikon D3200 for Dummies book to help us know how to use this camera.

It's not illegal to sell or buy grey market stuff, but it can make it complicated when getting repairs.  And, you can't help but feel you were misled by purchasing something meant for the overseas markets!Also, the accessories seem pretty low-quality.  In retrospect, I would rather have bought the Nikon kit for the USA market, saved up for accessories and purchased higher-quality items.Let me be clear though - the items were all new, the camera is flawless, the remote is nice, I use the bag and the cleaning kit all the time.  Live and learn!Since purchasing this kit, I've bought an auto-focus 200 mm lens.  The one in this kit is MANUAL FOCUS ONLY!

The materials in the extras are not the best but good enough. Everything except for extra lenses are in there. So as for a starter system camera or casual photography it is a very good alternative. For more extreme shots and picture processing it leaves something out though. It comes with the cheaper alternative for lenses.
