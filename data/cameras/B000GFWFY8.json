{"Reviews": [{"Title": "VERY Nice for the Price!", "Author": "Cap'n Stoob \"Stoob\"", "ReviewID": "R1ILOYRGS1KPJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, let's start off with what this camera ISN'T:1.  A point and shoot for easy carry2.  A DSLR that costs $1000+3.  A movie cameraOK, now that we've said that, let's talk about what this camera IS:1.  A LONG zoom DSLR-LIKE camera2.  Easy to hold3.  Easy to zoom4.  A RAW-capable, low-noise, excellent color photo machineThis camera is Fuji's answer to the Sony DSC-H5 and the Powershot G series cameras.  It has 6MP of resolution in a CCD chip mounted behind a large 10.7x optical, MANUAL zoom.  Let's examine some of the points to consider when talking about cameras.First, resolution is misleading.  Many consumers think that higher megapixels mean a nicer photo with sharper details and camera companies encourage this thinking by slapping megapixel numbers on the front of the camera and all over the ads.  Keep in mind, though, that megapixels alone do not a perfect photo make.  The pixels are tiny dots on an imaging chip and each pixel is only sensitive to ONE of the three colors cameras use to record light information:  red, green or blue.  Camera manufacturers choose how much of each chip's pixel allotment is assigned to each color, so you may find that maybe 50% is green and 25% each is red and blue.  Once that's decided, the chip maker has to determine the number of pixels to put on the chip.  Well, the bigger chips (like in DSLRs) can hold more pixels and the smaller chips (like in any camera that's NOT a DSLR) can hold more pixels ONLY if the pixels are made smaller.  So, if you have a half-inch chip with 10 MP and a quarter-inch chip with 10MP, the smaller chip has MUCH smaller pixels so it can squeeze them all in.  Now, you might think that this is good, since smaller pixels can capture more detail...but you're wrong.  When pixels are crammed too closely together, they can interfere with each other and loss of detail (noise) can result.  This camera has a 6MP resolution that is well-suited to the size of the chip.  The next model up, the s9000, has too many pixels on the chip and the images are noisier as a result.  So, in the basic area of resolution, this camera is respectable and, with its MANY modes, scene presets, color saturation, sharpness and exposure control and manual focus, you will be taking nice, sharp, pleasant photos.The next big thing is the zoom.  Bigger is usually better and this is no exception.  A large zoom allows for framing shots and the wide angle on this lens is perfect for scenes of mountains or beaches.  The manual zoom feature on this cannot be ignored: it is a SUPERIOR form of zoom control.  The zoom is fluid-damped, so it's smooth and precise.  You also get a manual focus ring if you need to use it and the LCD shows a focus check circle when you do (the \"manual zoom\" is controlled by your fingers, but it is technically electronic.)  The only downside is the lack of optical stabilization.  At long zooms, this is critical for a good shot.  The digital stabilizer just doesn't work as well.This camera can also shoot in RAW mode.  This is CRITICAL for those professional-looking shots!  You can get the image straight off the chip, with NO processing and then edit it with the included software.  This means that you can adjust white balance, sharpness, color and the color curve very precisely...almost like being able to take the photo over again!  I've done some macro work with the RAW mode and have been very pleased with what a little tweaking can do.  This camera encourages you to learn how to use it by being able to take good impromptu photos (with the very functional face detection system) and then allowing you to set whatever manual settings you want to.  Note that the JPG mode is good, but the compression of the JPG algorithm inevitably means loss of detail.  It's best (though inconvenient) to shoot RAW and convert in Photoshop to TIFF for printing perfect photos.The camera's other features are nice, as well:  big, crisp 2.5\" LCD with plenty of pixels for clear viewing, a previous shot mode that shows the three previous shots alongside your current window to help you frame things, a killer 640x480 movie mode with sound and 30fps capture and a long battery life with rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries.  Proprietary battery packs are a pain in the rear if you're caught without a spare or hours to charge.  With this, you can, in a pinch, grab some alkalines and get the shots you need!  HUZZAH, FUJIFILM!I've taken hundreds of photos with this since I got it and I can definitely say that, if you learn how to use it and the principles of photography, you can take GREAT photos with this.  If, however, you don't care about anything but pushing a button and getting an acceptable photo, then this is probably too much camera for you.  You MUST accept the fact that this is NOT a DSLR with a big chip and expensive lenses and it's not a movie camera...but it is very good for what it does and it is a definite recommend.The only bad point is the ridiculous xD card that is only for Olympus and Fuji cameras.  Not only are they more expensive per GB than any other card format, but they currently only go to 2GB.  That's a lot of photos, but it's still inferior to being able to get an 8GB CF or a 4GB SD card.  The s9000 CAN use CF cards, but this camera, in my opinion, takes less noisy photos and is the better buy for the price.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Why do you need a digital SLR when you can have this?", "Author": "S. Lancaster \"Happy Daddy!\"", "ReviewID": "R2LZF6SSTAEHDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was bought to replace a Kodak z740 which had lots of issues with focusing in low light. The s6000fd from Fuji is the same size of the more expensive digital SLRs and has a nice 'sturdy' feel and weight. The fact also that the camera runs on 4 'AA' batteries is nice, on one set of 2500 mAh rechargable NiMH, I have taken around 350 pictures and there is still no sign of weak batteries (it alerts you when the batteries are @ 1/4 charge left).The manual zoom worried me at first, but since using it I will NEVER go back to the powered (?) zoom. The camera also has a manual focus ring for those that want more control. Speaking of control, the s6000fd has FULL manual control. The ISO range can go up to 3200 ISO, but noise is quite noticeable in this area. The flash has a LONG range and will light up my whole living area. The 'face detection' feature really does work and is nice to have for those of use that take a lot of portrait shots or general people shots. Face detection works by finding faces in a scene and focusing on that, not something else. It can find up to 10 faces in one scene. Natural light mode is also nice, and even though some noise will be noticed on the computer screen, it is not on actual prints. The camera also has a 'Scene position' mode that includes preset settings for beach, snow, parties, museums, fireworks, sunsets, sports, nights, landscapes, anti-blur and portraits. The camera also includes a movie feature, but I can not speak for that since I will not use the camera to make movies. I must say this camera does NOT have image stabilization, but rather the anti-blur mode. The anti-blur works by bumping up the ISO and switching to a faster shutter speed. This works, but optical image stabilization would have been better, then again I have never found the need for either. The LCD is nice and BIG for us aging people. Focusing occurs in a snap and is the fastest I have ever seen on an advanced zoom camera. Remember the low light focusing issue that I mentioned earlier with the z740? Non existent on the s6000fd! I have taken tons of pictures in low light and they all have come out sharp and focused perfectly.The only complaints are that to delete a picture after taking it is to go into review and delete it from there. There is no way to delete immediately after taking. The only other issue is that it uses XD cards, instead of the more readily available SD cards. Just a side note, when I bought the XD card to use with the camera, I bought the Olympus 1 GB Model H card, its write time is about three time that of the Model M cards.Make sure to check out a few of the pictures I have posted above for some samples of this wonderful camera's pictures!  Enjoy!", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very impressed", "Author": "Monsoon777", "ReviewID": "R36WD1G0V76W1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The \"face detection\" feature, which sounds like a gimmick, for me quantifies this as the best digital I've ever used. A green box will appear over your subjects face and if they're like my toddler are constantly moving will actually follow their face (as long as they are looking in the general viscinity of the camera). It will give focus and lighting priority to their faces. It even works on the TV (had to try it).  The macro is excellent, and while I wasn't sure of a manual zoom it's way faster and ultimately better than a battery consuming zoom. The ISO of 3200 can take unblurry pictures without the flash in my very dark house and they're still usuable VS the throw away blurrrrr of my canon. I'm really happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought this over the S3-IS. - (From a former S2-IS owner.)  Only complaints are it's fairly large, but you can't put any super zoom in your pocket really.. The \"on board\" memory is about the dumbest thing ever. You can take about 1 picture on the finest mode before it's full. What's the point of that? I don't understand why you would buy a 6.3mp and use low quality shots. BUT the good news is the XD cards hold more per MB than the SD cards and are fast. Use the \"M\". I got a 1gb card they're quite reasonable and it'll hold about 350 pics at the best resolution (fine).  If you want really rapid shots you're probably better off with a DSLR (more money). This will take a shot about every two seconds with the correct focus settings. If you need faster than that.. you're not looking at sub $500 cameras anyways..To the reviewer before me: It takes one button to use all flash features. Push once for AUTO, then once for Red Eye Reduction, then once for Forced (what yours was obviously on) and once more for suppressed (always off).  They use the the lightning bolt icon same as on a Sony, and on a Canon, And it takes one setting to turn off the preview after you take a shot. Landscape setting is only for LANDSCAPES you have a landscape shot in your backyard?  Compact flash cards are outdated (too big) compared to SD or XD, and you show me a new digital camera not made of plastic and I'll eat my review. I do know it is sometimes about the \"feel\" that's a very personal thing.. And I'm not trying to be a jerk here but you should have used \"AUTO\". Because anyone who doesn't know how to shut of a flash shouldn't be using the advanced settings, and then complain when they don't turn out right. I think you also shouldn't slam a product without reading the manual . It's just not fair to the manufacturers. I hope you like your next one.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R316J2ZZHV2JIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Fuji S6000fd in December 2006 to help me take better pictures and to experiment with advanced photography techniques.  Initially, I had mixed feelings about this camera and several times even considered selling it to get a \" better dSLR\".  But after thinking long and hard and using it quite a bit and comparing its image qualities, I have come to the conclusion that it is indeed an excellent camera for what it is intended for.  The camera is now a keeper.I use this camera mostly for travel and family pictures.  Below are my personal views about this camera:PROS:1. Picture quality:  This is generally sharp with excellent color rendition (I use \"chrome\") for ISO 100-800.2. Noise:  This becomes evident only at ISO 800-1600, but they are still usable after running the pictures through Neat Image noise reduction filter, at 25% amount for ISO 800 and 75% for ISO 1600. I don't use ISO3200 because of loss of details.3. SLR-like:  This is the closest thing to an SLR with manual twist zoom, program mode dial and comfortable grip/ergonomics.  The fixed lens comes with a nice looking hood and allows for the use of polarizer filter for creative control.4. Live view/histogram:  This is without a doubt the BEST feature of this camera.  I use it every time to compose my shots and adjust my exposure compensation and white balance to \"get it right first time\".  As a result, I am getting very high percentage of quality pictures out of this camera without having to do much post processing.  To do this with a dSLR, you will have to take a shot first, then preview on the LCD, make the camera adjustments and then take the shot again. With the live view, it is close to WYSIWYG.5. Focal range of 28-300mm:  The 28mm wide angle provides excellent coverage for landscapes and in tight internal spaces.  I don't use the telephoto range as much but it's there when I need it to zoom in on the details.6. Face detection:  It works, so I use for all people shots.7. Movie mode:  This is a bonus feature, and works well enough that it has replaced my camcorder.  I get 30 minutes of video from a 1 GB card. The manual zoom works but you have to move it slowly to avoid \"jumpiness\" as the lens changes focus.8. AA battery:  I already use rechargeables, so not having to buy a spare lithium battery is a benefit.9. Price: At ~$300+ and for the quality/features, this camera offers tremendous value.CONS:1. No image stabilization: This is a potential deal breaker for many buyers. But compared to other non-dSLRs with noisy pictures at ISO400 and up, shooting at ISO 800-1600 on the Fuji S6000fd offers a \"compromise\" which somewhat compensates for the lack of a real optical image stabilizer.  But this is 2007, so I think it should be a requirement to include OIS on any lens longer than 200mm.  I personally don't use long zoom that much, so it is less of an issue.  But it would be nice if Fuji include this feature for its next release.2. No shallow depth of field:  This means you can't isolate the subject by creating a blurred background, and is a universal problem for all P&S; cameras with small sensors.  With Fuji S6000fd, there is some work around, such as using telephoto focal length combined with macro mode, but the blur effect is not as good as what a dSLR can produce.3. Limited burst mode:  Continuous mode is slow and the buffer is limited to only 3 shots.  If you taken a lot of action photography, then this camera will be woefully inadequate.4. Electronic Viewfinder:  The brightness can be adjusted up or down but the resolution is only 135K pixels so it is not as sharp.5. Auto mode: This camera doesn't produce good pictures with Auto mode or even the Natural mode because of the tendency to use high ISO. Those looking for a simple P&S; should look at Fuji F20 or Canon models.Conclusion:  There are trade-offs in any camera purchase.  Despite my initial hesitation, this is an excellent camera that offers close to (but not the same as) what you'll get from a dSLR. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn photography but not ready to invest in a dSLR.This would have been a \"perfect\" camera (for me, at least) if Fuji had included optical image stabilization (for another 2-3 stop advantage) and a higher resolution EVF.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera--especially for the $$ !!", "Author": "Craig Sanders \"saxman\"", "ReviewID": "R27PY6H5VD8QVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera! It feels like a D-SLR and blows away my Sony Mavica 200 from a few years back that I paid twice the price for. I'm sure a top notch DSLR has it's advantages, but this camera gets it done really well, really quick and relatively easy! HUGE features that I love:1) Manual ZOOM 10.7x-- You get there quick and you don't run down your batteries with power draining motor zoom (took 210 shots with older NiMH batteries).  My biggest disappointment with the quick & easy cameras has always been the lame optical Zoom that usually maxed at 3x.2) 1600 & 3200 ISO speeds -- life-saver for 4x6 moment keepers in mod>low light.  A lot of sites were saying these speeds rendered totally unuseable photos, but that is ONLY if you are trying to print an 8 x 10.  I have taken 100+ photos at 1600 ISO inside with moderate>low light (NO FLASH) and they totally blew away any moderate>low light picture ever taken with my Mavica 200.  The Sony always streaked unless you used the flash and those pictures were always unbalanced in light and color (even after setting White Balance).  It's actually hard to take an unuseable picture.3) FACE DETECTION - Great feature to help set up the camera to take the best possible shot with the most natural color.  SO EASY and works SO WELL!4) Nice 2.5\" LCD & easy to navigate -- I always frame my shots on the LCD and this one doesn't disappoint.  The small Digital Viewfinder is the ONLY negative about the camera (it's somewhat challenging to get a clear look at your subject).  Overall, this camera is as easy to navigate as any other I have used.  A rolling dial to adjust parameters would have been a nice bonus, but not missed!5) Natural Light Mode -- Very cool for getting the best shot without a flash (you can even take one with and one without flash at the same time--VERY COOL)6) RAW photo capture -- SUPER HIGH RES photos with great detail!  At the camera's price, that's a definite BONUS!7) Manual options GALORE!  You can go all manual, Aperture priority, Shutter priority, or a PROGRAM mode where Shutter & Aperture are still handled by the camera, but you can set most everything else (very nice).Overall, for @$400 I don't think anyone can complain about the value/performance factor of this camera.  Get a 1GB or 2GB xD Picture Card (H model) and let 'er fly.  It's a FUN camera that feels like a PRO camera!  I hope this helps you as I was somewhat apprehensive before I bought mine.

Victor", "ReviewID": "R38RE7TNHB1BL5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after a few months of research. I was keenly looking at the 9500/9000 series when this camera came out and it sported the spectacular F30 sensor. Initially, the first month was a learning curve, I messed up a lot of pictures, the AUTO modes were slightly different from what I had experienced in the Canons. But, after 3 months of use, I a happy with the camera. This is definitely, as of now, the best low light, mega zoom bridge camera. Indoors, low light pictures are great, it captures the ambiance well, with or without the flash. Even if it uses flash, it is not so harsh as I have seen in other cams. The face detection detects faces as FUJI claims. It has a nice 10.7X manual zoom, which is super. The camera ergonomics and design is great. Few options are slightly buried in the menus, which could have been better. The overall look and feel is great, very much like SLR. I had a few people look intently at my camera in the malls. One guy, wanted to read my model on the camera. There is a slight learning curve with this camera. It is not your simple point and shoot camera. If you want an alternative to SLR and save money, this might be the camera. The canon S2 and S3 are great cameras but they are definitely behind the Fuji in indoors and low light situation. Here is a list of what I like and what I dont likeWhat I like.1. Wonderful 10.7X manual zoom2. High ISO capability. Great low light photography. Very good ISO 800, I had some nice ISO 1600 and a few ISO 3200 were worth keeping. Ofcourse, the are no comparison to SLR, but, this is not a SLR and is a bridge cam.3. The modes, dials, usage, feel, grip and overall feel is SLR like.4. A best All-in-one package, non removable wideangle lens from 28-300mm, which covers most of the zoom range. Extra wide or tele can be achieved with adaptors.5. Wonderful, live -preview 2.5 inch LCD, unlike a SLR, where you have to use the viewfinder to compose and take the shot.6. Impressive, movie capabilities and good resolution.7. Takes AA batteries, so the user can buy anytime, anywhere, any brand.8. Decent software with the package. Especially, raw editor available for editing raw images.What could have been better.1. EVF is pathetic, very bad resolution, only suitable for framing and composing the shot2. Uses xD card. SD card would have been a better option3. The AUTO mode is not as dependable as I would like it. Potrait mode would be a better mode for all -round casual shooting. Of course, there a host of different modes for different settings. But AUTO, is not great.4. Outdoor shots image quality are just a little, behind Canon. In terms of sharpness and saturation.

Better image quality. This camera has one of the best CCD sensors available. You can confirm this by going to imaging-resource dot com and using their neat \"comparometer\", which gives enlargeable side by side sample images for nearly any two cameras you want to compare. This was a revelation because I'm a show-me kind of guy. You can read all the reviews you want, but this tool put the proof in my face. I stacked up nearly every other competitive brand under $500 against the Fuji S6000fd, and none could stand the comparison. This gem even takes down most DSLR's at more than thrice it's price in terms of picture detail and noise, especially at high ISO's. This proves that you don't need 12 million pixels for a good picture, just a few million GOOD pixels.  I really like the manual zoom adjust as compared to a motor driven lens, which is, BTW what crapped on my Canon S1, resulting in the dreaded E18 error code. The Fuji has plenty of other manual features too, including focus, aperture and shutter priority, here is where the best results will be obtained. My Canon definitely had the advantage in Auto mode, as my photos were consistently better with the S1.  Here is where this review turns slightly south. There are  features glaringly missing in this package. Some may call them bells and whistles, but once you have them, you are spoiled. The first is optical image stabilization. I was hard pressed to take a blurry pic with my Canon, even at long zooms. The S6000 does compensate by bumping the ISO, but even at ISO 1600, detail is still lost. Secondly, having a flip LCD opens up tons more creative possibilities by allowing the shooter to compose at different perspectives without having to lie on the ground or climb a ladder. With the flip LCD, you can lurk at family events in stealth mode, camera in lap, and catch the perfect candid shot by not being seen in the arms extended digital camera pose.  Another peeve of mine is photo deletion. A good size memory card can store hundreds of hi-res photos. Why do I have to delete one at a time or all at once? Even my very old Casio QV8000 kept a folder file that allowed deletion by batches. The Fuji takes about 3-4 seconds for each photo to go bye-bye, and it's pretty easy to do an \"oopsy\" and kill the whole card. The S6000 does have a nice feature in the live histogram, but try holding down the button to activate it, and using your thumb to toggle the aperture while smashing your face against the viewfinder to check the results.  I have become spoiled by long zoom cameras since I love shooting birds and other wildlife, so I put a high priority on features like \"IS\" and a flip LCD. If i were rating this camera stricly on the image quality it's capable of, it would be an easy 5 star review. However, I don't throw out 5 star reviews for just any product that I like. So you should consider this a very good review from a demanding customer. If Fujifilm upgrades this camera to include more features and improves the auto mode, they have a Canon killer, especially at the near $320 price point.The good:Best image quality for this price any beyondGreat macrosGood battery lifeSuper photos at higher ISOManual zoom and focus ringsGood in low lightWide range 28-300 lensSome neat shooting modesThe Negs:No optical image stabilizerNo flip LCDSlow picture deletionSome controls fiddly in \"P\" modeIt's big!", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Deserves More Credit", "Author": "Z.

I expect performance, quality, and flawless capability to adapt to different environments. After being a Kodak fanboy of owning a Z7590 and loving the capabilities of the camera, I was skeptical about this camera and Fuji's under the radar approach to digital camera. I tested this camera at a local store against a higher end kodak and the results were much better. There was less \"noise\" and the fuji allowed for sharper images in nighttime. People have said they have had problems working this camera inside. Its not that hard. You just have to experiment with different settings and lights. I will say this, if you just a point and shoot person, this camera may not be for you. I agree with the comment stating this is a \"prosumer\" camera. It has the look and feel of an SLR. It has a manual zoom which I absolutely love and the focus ring make it a better buy. I am a backpacker by nature and this camera is great outdoors. It takes vivid pictures and the macro capabilities are great. It allows for easy on and off and people say that it does not have \"image stabilization\" it does. I put the camera in shutter priority mode and juiced the shutter up to the max and it works great. They have a setting for the image stabilization, but i use that for keeping the camera steady when my hands arent. I will admit, its a little awkward at first, but so is riding a bike for the first time. You have to work at it to get a rythmn down and it will be easy to operate. People say they are having a hard time with indoor shooting. Honestly, work with the camera in different lightings...Problem Solved. I hate the flashes on camera indoors cause it looks bad and when I use low flashes it works perfectly because I work out a rhythm with my camera. I am experimenting with ISO settings now and the results are great. I havent had a chance to test out the software, but from what I gather it is pretty much the same as all the others. Person can do basic changes to the image. This camera I have seen go for 420 and up in stores in my hometown and you are getting a steal here. I got my camera one day earlier than expected.

I found out about it only after doing a lot of research.  If you are an experienced or serious amateur (e.g., a former film SLR user), you will almost certainly love this camera.  But even a less-experienced point-and-shooter may be surprised at how easy it is to take great pictures with.(Note: At the end of July 2007, Fuji announced a new 8MP version of this camera coming in Sept.  But more megapixels aren't always better.  For example, the Finepix F31fd with 6MP provides slightly better quality -- lower noise -- than the F40fd with 8MP.)My wife wanted the best picture quality possible without going up to a $700 digital SLR.  She likes to take people pictures, often in dim light without flash.  I wanted a camera that would enable me to control the shutter speed and/or aperture, and be a worthy successor to my old manual-focus Canon A-1 35mm film SLR.  So I looked at models with excellent sharpness, low-light sensitivity, and manual controls.  At first I was considering more compact cameras (such as the Canon SD800, Fujifilm Finepix F31fd and E900, and the Panasonic Lumix LX3 or TZ series).  But after reading several detailed reviews, I got very interested in the S6000fd.  I then played around with one at the camera store and was surprised by how easy to hold it was.  And after using it for almost 500 pictures on a one-week vacation in Colorado, it has exceeded my high expectations for quality, ease of use, and versatility.The best features:1. Low-light sensitivity.  Unlike other non-SLR digicams, the S6000fd sensor takes very clear, low-noise pictures even at ISO 400 or 800 (with an option to go up to 3200).  This enables you to take better handheld shots with less light, even at twilight or with regular indoor lighting.  It also makes the lack of electronic image stabilization unnecessary -- unless perhaps you often need to take telephoto pictures in low light.2. Excellent zoom lens goes from an equivalent 28mm (true wide angle) to 300mm (10.7x), so you can frame  just about any subject perfectly.  The best aspect of the zooming is that you do it manually with a twist of the lens ring itself -- MUCH faster and easier to frame your subject precisely than any automatic zoom!3. Very comfortable and secure grip makes the increased size and weight vs. our other point-and-shoot cameras almost unnoticeable.  I mean it.  This was my No. 1 concern, but I  actually believe this camera is more comfortable and easy to hold steady than any of those sleek little silver digicams!  (Caution to men: Before you get this for your wife, mother, daughter, or girlfriend, however, remember that she might also want to keep a little camera in her handbag.)4. Face-detection feature -- This really works!  It not only ensures the faces are in focus, but also meters to ensure they are correctly exposed.  This enables you to concentrate on timing to get those smiles.  It's also easy to turn off (in case you are more concerned about the scenery) with direct button access.5. Quick response from power-up, and almost nonexistent shutter lag.  Autofocusing and shot-to-shot are not the fastest (or so I read), but plenty fast enough for 99% of the time, I believe.6. Uses AA batteries -- easy to get fresh set, just in case your rechargeables are out or not ready.7. Able to zoom while taking movies!8. Outstanding flash strength -- up to 27 feet!  And almost no red-eye, partly because the flash pops up quite high.9. Able to take RAW photos for more flexible correction of exposure or color on the computer.  (I have used it a few times, but it does take time to edit and then convert to JPEG for slide shows, etc.)10. Large and sharp (215k) 2.5\" LCD screen...which leads me to theONE real disadvantage:1. The \"eye-level\" (traditional) viewfinder is an electronic one that provides only about 100k pixels, so it's not quite as sharp as one would like.  But it's certainly good enough to compose pictures, and if even if you wear glasses, it has a diopter adjustment -- a feature one rarely finds except on higher-priced models.  The only reason I need this viewfinder is my presbyopia.  No that's not a religion, but a vision problem of middle age: I cannot easily focus on the LCD without my reading glasses.)There are a couple of other nitpicks, such as the menu system being a little less user-friendly than some, and the color saturation boost from the F-chrome setting being a little overdone.  (I use it anyway because I like how it boosts the intensity of otherwise somewhat drab greenery.)Many people seem to think that somehow xD Picture cards are slow or hard to find.  I got a 2GB \"H\" speed (for about $45) and it is plenty fast.  True, not all printers have an xD slot.  So get a $10 card reader, or just upload the pictures to your PC.  (If it still bothers you, the new S8000 has an SD/xD card slot.)The Canon SD800 and Canon S5 were two models on my list.  The SD850 doesn't have a long telephoto (or face detection), and the S5 lacks a true wide-angle lens (yet costs a lot more).  I was also considering the Panasonic Lumix LX, and TZ series with wide-angle lenses, but all of them suffer from high noise (and noise reduction) starting at ISO 200-400.  The Sony H7 or H9 are also worthy competitors, but they didn't seem to have any major advantages, unless you need stabilization for lots of extreme telephoto pictures.  In that case, another attractive model is the Olympus Evolt E510, with an incredible 18x zoom starting at 28mm and OIS.But in detailed picture-quality comparisons, the Fujifilm S6000fd was superior to all of those, and it's almost $200 less.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice for high quality pictures.", "Author": "whysofma", "ReviewID": "R3SAG52W6LRVMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 8 months and thought I'd post a review. I purchased this camera to help record my new son's development. Since I was taking pictures of him (and my wife) more and more, I thought it was a good time to upgrade.First of all, the picture quality is excellent, and is on par with a dSLR in many instances. Previously I had a 4-year old Canon P&S;, which still holds its own, but the s6000 is superior for interior/low-light shots, and has better color accuracy. It also takes more consistently focused and exposed pictures than my old camera. I have no regrets about upgrading. In fact my wife often asked why we didn't get a better camera sooner.In addition to the picture quality, this camera focuses very quickly, and the Face Detection is highly useful if you take a lot of posed shots. It doesn't get in the way if the camera doesn't lock onto a face, and you can use the face detection preview feature to quickly check if your subjects were blinking when you clicked the shutter.The next important feature is that, unlike a dSLR, I can use it to take high quality movies. No one wants invest or lug around a video camera in addition to a still camera. dSLRs don't do video (and they don't have a live preview on the back). The Fuji is great to take 50 pictures, and those 2 or 3 minute movies to fully capture the moment.Finally, the manual zoom ring gives you great control over the framing of your picture. I originally believed a camera with such a large zoom was only useful for taking pictures of birds in trees, but it's so much more than that. From a close position you can quickly frame your image from lots of background, to practically none. This isn't an advanced technique, and a zoom ring (rather than a rocker switch) lets everyone take better pictures.Here are a few other selling points for this camera:Great Battery lifeFast USB 2.0 transfer to the computerFeels solid and comfortable in your handStandard 4x6 (2:3) images so you don't have to cropMinuses:Yes, there are a few things I'm not too keen on...First and foremost, the camera is not small. It's no P&S;, and often gets in the way when I'm out and about. That's the price of a great lens I suppose. You can't quickly slip it in your pocket when you're done taking pictures, and it feels a little precarious as it hangs from a strap around your neck. So I end up holding on to it for a 5-minute round of taking pictures, then place the camera in the case and get back to enjoying my day. Because of this, I'd consider purchasing a Fuji F31fd, which is essentially the same camera without the great zoom. Having both would be ideal.Second, the programs aren't too great. They work fine outside, but to get the most from the camera, you should shoot in the P,S,A, or M modes. In fact, if you only use the P mode, and change the ISO as needed (100 or 200 on a bright sunny day, 400 inside with lots of (natural) light, and 800 in side in dim lighting) you should be 100% pleased with your shots.All-in-all I'm very happy with the s6000.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!

Between a test of my 4 mp camera and this one, the images were actually quite close - the 4mp camera had a little more purple fringing and color shift though.  Besides its naturalistic color, where this camera really shines though is in its RAW format, and in its 10x manual optical zoom - the control factor is invaluable plus.  The 'auto' settings of this camera are not its strength (actually the straight 'auto' setting of the 4mp camera took better photos overall than the Fuji did in its straight 'auto' setting) - the first thing to do with this camera is to change the sharpness to 'soft', lower the default '200' ISO setting, and change the JPEG setting (press 'F' button) to '6 mp F' or use RAW mode; otherwise the images come out too compressed and grainy.  Turning off the 'focus check' is helpful for moving objects - the enlarged image  popping into view at the center can be distracting.So far it seems using the 'Program' mode allows simple enough adjustments of exposure value to make it usable for most 'point and shoot' situations while still producing excellent photos in JPEG format.  Once in 'Program' mode or other more manual modes, the images are great.Probably could not recommend this camera to someone who just wanted a point and shoot model, as it rewards those who want to explore its manual settings.This camera would've been improved by having a jog dial for the shutter/aperture control, but all in all this is a great camera and I love using it.  Would definitely recommend it to others who don't have limitless wallets, but want to be able to adjust their images in RAW format and who are willing to take some time to learn about shutter and aperture settings.There was a review posted saying that the batteries pop out too easily because of a faulty door, but I've not found this to be the case.

I went out to take some scenic pictures with each camera and when I got home I was left very..  Underwhelmed.

I was looking for a camera that was able to give me excellent quality prints and I was willing to sacrifice on things like size and complexity (not that this turned out to be a complex camera at all).

Something like the Canon PowerShot A570IS, or the Kodak Z712 IS.  I had heard about the cult following surrounding Fuji's F31fd cameras - fantastic low-light shooting and a SuperCCD sensor in a compact size.  The thing that got me about the F31fd was the proprietary battery and relatively high price.  So when I saw the S6000fd marked down from the original retail price, I initially balked because of the DSLR-like size.  But then I thought for the price, I could definitely \"move up\" and start learning some more intermediate aspects of photography instead of just going for a new P&S.;There are some usability features such as the face-detection, Natural light 2-shot mode (one with flash, one without), but others have reviewed them in depth.Main pros for me:- Value; same price as many point & shoots- 28-300 mm manual zoom lens- Full manual controls- SuperCCD sensor for higher-quality images- Low light shooting (up to ISO 3200, though I quickly found you really don't want to use higher than ISO 800).- Uses AA batteries; I also bought the newer NiMH batteries by Rayovac (Hybrid), Sanyo Eneloops I've heard retain a slightly better charge over time.  Some reviews claim 450+ shots on one charge, but I think I got about 350, though I left the camera on quite a bit between shots.Rayovac Hybrid - Battery 4 x AA NiMH 2000 mAhGE/SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesCons:- Uses the more proprietary xD memory card format (I ended up getting a 2 GB Type M card by Olympus, couldn't pass up the price even though I wanted a Type H.  Type H doesn't mean High Def as the last reviewer said, it simply has a faster read/write speed.  To me, Type M is fast enough for shooting photos and videos, but I don't shoot in RAW format).- No optical image stabilization.  I think Fujifilm's replacement for this model will definitely have that, as well as SD or CF card compatibility.  You do end up having to take multiple shots due to blurring in low-light situations.- The digital image stabilization isn't that useful.  In low-light situations where blurring from hand-shake is prevalent, taking pictures in the shake setting causes the ISO level to go up too high.  I got better results by shooting in Shutter priority, manually setting the ISO to 400 or 800.- The auto mode is also not that great.  In good lighting conditions or with flash, it takes pictures fairly well.  However, with the flash off it also boosts the ISO too high, resulting in a noisy picture.  I found I was using the Aperature or Shutter priority mode with a set ISO of 100-400 depending on the situation.- You can't set the self-timer to stay for shot after shot; needs to be manually selected from the menu each time.Don't be discouraged by the smaller-sounding 6 MP.  It's plenty to print 8x10s or even larger photos.  Also, I've read that having less MP for a given CCD sensor will make for a higher quality photo, e.g. 6 MP for this CCD would be better than squeezing 10 MP on the same CCD.I also considered the Canon S3 IS, a much more popular DSLR-like camera in the same price range.  It does have the optical image stabilizer, but most professional reviews online tout the S6000fd's superior image quality (particularly from ISO 200-800) and lens quality over the S3.

For example, in an indoor place with no direct sunlight (but lots of ambient natural light), the exposure time can go as high as 1/10 seconds, with F2.8 and ISO 100. Obviously, without a tripod, you will have a hard time getting a good picture. Even with a higher ISO, you'll still need long exposure times, like 1/20 or 1/30.No live preview on how the image will look with the current settings when on non automatic modes.

If you can live with the excellent lens which ranges from the equivelent of 28mm wide angle to 300mm telephoto in 35mm film cameras then you do not need to spend $1000+ on a dSLR. The lens' range takes you from shooting interiors (mostly all of a room) to true telephoto (6X a normal lens in 35mm film cameras). Also it is threaded for 58mm filters! One could put a UV or 1A filter on the front to protect the lens. Or use a circular polarizer to get that deep blue sky effect on a nice sunny day.

Then I upgraded to the Fuji 3800 only because my buttons broke on the a210.  Well, I was thrilled with the 3800 until my photo cell went out last week.  I decided I HAD to have a new FUJI!!  After looking through countless reviews I knew the Fuji s6000 would be the camera for me.  I was so right.  I just got the camera on Friday the 27th and already have taken over 600 pictures.  I love the choices on this camera.  I've practiced with all the modes so far & by far my favorite is the supermacro.  My 4 year old son is in love with bugs.  Since having this camera we have taken supermacro pics of a pink ladybug, a wasp & nest, giant bubblebees, a few different kinds of butterflies, many different beetles & a ladybug larva.  The pictures are awesome.  One was so close we realized the ladybug had a \"mickey\" (3 dots together) on her back when we zoomed in & developed the picture.  No one reviewed, or I didn't see it, that this camera takes pictures in pitch black rooms.  I tested it & it was unbelievable.  There is this green light that goes on & like nightvisions it.  The screen is viewable outside so you can take pics & delete right there.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!  I hope it is one of the last ones I'll ever have to buy, but if not I will definately stick with Fuji!  I have tried the other brands but this is the one that always wins me over.  If you want a good deal here is the place to get it.  I went to Cord Camera & the guy tried to sell me this camera by telling me about the rebate & all the bells & whistles with it, and then I told him I had ordered it off of here at a cheaper price plus got the rebate & he was amazed. Good price & if you need a new camera don't wait because you won't find a better deal.  I got the 1 GB card & it's definately big enough.  Over 300 Pictures with 6M F & over 600 pics with 6M regular.  Good luck & enjoy this camera.  I got the Tamarac 5515 bag for this & it fits awesome.  I would recommend getting the gotcha wrist strap if you like to hold your camera instead of it around your neck all the time.  This is a solid awesome camera.

I also have a DSLR (Olympus E510), but I still think the Fuji wins with the Olympus on several things (I got the Olympus only because it's got a bigger sensor that can easily accommodate its 10 megapixels; also wanted  to see if there's something that can beat this Fuji).  The Fuji has a much bigger zoom (and you don't have to change lenses), which is sharp and with a very good focus, and, what I consider a big plus, it has a Chrome setting for pictures.  Set your pictures to chrome and see what a difference in color this setting makes.  Of course, it depends if you want pretty pictures or if you want pictures that accurately reflect what you see.  Either way, you will not get disappointed with this camera! And you'll love the manual zoom - the lens is superb!  Oh, and one more thing - take pictures on the manual setting - the auto setting is fine too but you'll get much better results with the manual (don't be afraid, it's really easy!).

I liked my old camera, but wanted more ability to take low light pictures.  The controls on this camera are very easy--you can change between settings quickly, once you read the manual and know what you want to use.  The record speed is a pleasant several steps up from my old camera--no more click and wait!  The thing I like about the camera best, however, is that it has so many automatic features that help me take better pictures.  The face focus feature is great, and although I originally was sceptical about the frame lines, I now use them regularly.  I love the manual zoom--and I've taken upwards of a thousand pictures off one charge of my rechargeable batteries, probably because of that feature.  One thing that worried me before I purchased it is the lack of an optical stabilizer--I occasionally get a blurry picture, and my husband more so, but if you are willing to set your elbows in & hold the camera steady, you won't have a blur problem even at the longest zoom--which really is amazing!

Because of its lense and many features I tend to use it less like a point and shoot and more like an SLR. But it still is incredibly easy to use if you don't want to put any effort into it. The best feature is the mechanical zoom lense - very much like an SLR and a thousand times better than the little zoom buttons. All long zoom digital cameras should have a lense like this. The electronic viewfinder isn't all that great and the face detection is great when it works, but it doesn't find faces in profile or with glasses, etc. But these are small details considering how great it is to have an SLR-like camera that can also take movies, doesn't have dust problems, and has an incredible 28 to 300 zoom lense.

Overall I'm quite pleased, but I'm not through mastering this camera just yet.  There is only one big negative for me and that is lack of image stabilization.  This is not the best camera for action shots - I get lots of blurred shots when I try to photograph my kids or dogs while they are moving - which is most of the time.Other than that, I love the low light features - you can get a decent picture in a nearly totally dark room or outside under the moon.  I love the Natural setting where you can take 2 pics with one click, one using flash the other without and compare the 2.  I love the fact that my batteries last FOREVER!!!!

I learned to love it as I learned how to use a digital camera.  Both the good and bad reviews are right.  I will agree with those saying that this camera is not for beginners.  It can easily produce bad photos, especially in the easy preset and scene position modes.  I thought auto was pretty good.  This camera is no longer available and the only Fujifilm in the S class that might be comparable would be the s100fs but it costs about twice as much.  If you want a Fujifilm, I guess you should probably try to get the s6000fd used, since it is an excellent camera and an excellent value.The only other camera I considered buying was an Olympus, which also had good reviews in PC World and Consumer Reports.  It supposedly was good at low light and landscape/nature shots which was important to me.  One of these reviews and reviewers here said the s6000fd has noisy images which concerned me.  The only comparison I had was my dad's old Canon s230 which does have great color and near perfect white balance in its auto setting, unlike the s6000fd.  I first noticed greens and browns were significantly off on outdoor shots.  Color correctness is as important to me as detail so I learned to set the custom white balance one or more times a day for outdoor light, regular incandescent, fluorescent and mixed lighting situations.  It's a bit of a pain to take a picture of a white piece of paper every time you move into a different light situation but you can't fix it later with fancy white balance manual or auto edit controls.  The camera white balance presets don't work either.  White balance is automatically set to the flash when you use the flash.  If the camera complains about overexposure when setting the custom white balance on a bright day, reduce the aperture width temporarily.  The Canon and Olympus have a good reputation for quality landscapes, but the s6000fd has excellent detail and very good color.  The ISO should be as low as possible, preferably 100, and I think I noticed, as others did, a slight washed out or lack of color, but that can easily be fixed, as others mentioned, by switching from standard to chrome on the camera, or increasing color saturation later in a good editor.  Sharpness and contrast can also be added later in a good editor.Another serious problem associated with the s6000fd is noise and graininess, especially in low light shots.  I'm sure this as well as serious loss of color is caused by a high ISO setting.  The anti-shake and natural preset modes boost ISO way up.  Using the flash can also do it.  Beware of most of the preset modes, which do a lot more harm than good.  Learn the few you really need that work well.  Auto seemed to work well, at least when there was enough light, and should be good enough until you learn the more manual modes.  Aperture priority, shutter priority, and program mode let you fix ISO at 100, 200, or 400 if you are hurting for light.  Above 800, even if the picture looks ok, you may get grain and noise once you start trying to edit.A related problem of blurry pictures is a photography problem rather than a problem with this camera.  In low light the shutter has to stay open longer to get enough light exposure.  If the camera shakes or the object in the picture is moving too fast you get a motion or blurry picture.  A real optical/mechanical stabilization in this camera would help.  The LCD screen is good but not good enough to see the slight blur in your picture.  Your pictures will be at risk if the camera is displaying 1/60 or 1/30 seconds shutter speed.  You can take steps to widen the aperture or increase the ISO a little or steady your camera or yourself but you may want to just fix the shutter priority and try to increase the exposure later during editing.  You better get used to low light conditions, especially if you avoid using the flash like I do.  The camera has a \"natural\" preset mode, but it doesn't produce good pictures as others have said.  When I paid attention to ISO and shutter speed my low light photos turned out beautiful.Almost everything about the camera is a strength.  It feels natural in your hands and doesn't feel too heavy or light.  You will need to read the manual to make good use of it, though.  The 10x zooms are beautiful and detailed.  Super macro takes excellent shots at one inch away.  Manual focus works well but you will need to turn off the check focus which pops up a magnifier center window disrupting your view with every adjustment.  The shutter delay auto focus is slow and uncertain.  I click the focus button in manual focus mode to focus the shot and then take the shot when I'm ready in an instant with the shutter button.  I always leave exposure at 0 since it can easily be adjusted later in a good editor.  Night mode is a real convenience and works very well on all night or very low light shots.  Shutter speed will drop way down so you still have to worry about blur from camera shake.  You will probably have to change the exposure in editing to get the correct darkness level, too.  Portrait mode, face detection, and flash work well.  The camera has continuous shooting which you will need for impossible to time shots like whales, dolphins, turtles.  It doesn't work with RAW, though, so you better shoot under good photo conditions.  FinePixViewer editor is good but doesn't let you change camera settings later and salvage partial over/under exposure photos like you can with RAW photos in Elements.Some problems are: I needed a broccoli rubber band to keep the battery door from opening spontaneously Battery warning light comes on when only about five shots are left Downloading pictures stopped working on Windows 2000 SP4, so you should have XP or higher (or Mac OSX if compatible with Elements 6) Lens guard works well but can get into your picture so check after each shot Infinity focus (for sunsets) is dubious since there are no stops at either end of manual focusPhoto tips: buy enough 2 GB XD memory cards (150 RAW photos per card) for all your trip photos buy a recharger and at least one extra set of rechargeable batteries edit RAW with Adobe PhotoShop Elements ($45) Lowe Pro TLZ mini bag fits camera perfectly edit photos to be printed using heavy old CRT monitor (not LCD) or prints will look much darker use Snapfish (highest quality by far) and get 4 x 5.3 prints of camera's native 3 x 4 ratio photos to avoid chopping avoid taking waterfall shots except in early mornings, late afternoons, or on cloudy days", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Super camera", "Author": "William Foos \"Brownsbacker\"", "ReviewID": "R2O8ITUXJE5FZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been taking picture like crazy!!

It had been originally announced sometime in 2006, but wasn't available until around the Christmas season. I got my hands on one and loved it, but had been keeping my eyes on products from Canon and Nikon, so I waited.The editors of Popular Photography & Imaging magazine gave it a 2006 POP Award in December 2006, and I watched as further awards and good reviews appeared. I still waited, largely because I wondered if a digital 'bridge' camera\" had any merit, or if I should go ahead and invest in a real DSLR. The demise of Konica Minolta's entire camera division had left Fuji as one of the very few options if one wanted a fully-featured long-zoom 'bridge' camera with a real wide angle lens. But the more I thought about it, the more that it made good sense, so I bought it here in October 2007.It was judgement call that I've never regretted.Today we've seen the reemergence of the 'bridge' camera as the logical alternative for those who want more than your average compact digital camera, and the Fujifilm FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with its 30x wide-angle optical zoom and 3-inch LCD is such an example. It's a big step up from my 6.3 megapixels and 10.7x wide-angle optical zoom its 2.5-inch LCD display.There are so many good reviews posted here for the Fuji S6000fd that I'm going to take the low road and just highlight the good, the bad and the ugly, so to speak.The good:* Quality optics, have nothing to complain about from any of the thousand of images taken.* Excellent ergonomics, everything is easy to access once one learns the layout.* Nice 10x optical zoom range, from 28-300mm.* Uses 4-AA batteries. As a result I've bought Sanyo eneloop NiMH batteries and love them.* Very good ergonomics, it feels like a regular 35mm camera.* It takes filters, just like a 35mm film camera. 58mm filters, to be exact.* Superb ergonomics... wait, I said that already.The bad:* Flash cuts off part of the subject on close-ups with the lens hood in use.The ugly:* Fujifilm's decision to go with the xD card as opposed to the SD. Bad move.As noted earlier, I'm not alone in my likes of this excellent digital camera. In a world of 10 MP cameras, its 6-megapixel CCD still give me enough good detail for excellent 16 x 20-inch prints. It had been used in a variety of climates and locations, and not once has it let me down. I would down-rate this camera because of Fuji's use of the xD card as an image storage device, but I had weighed that before I purchased it, so I knew ahead of time that this was the case.Updated January 10, 2012:This good and faithful camera has done well by and for me over the years, but my Nikon D5000 DSLR had largely replaced it for serious work. My Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR with its 12 megapixels, bright 3.0-Inch LCD and 15x wide-angle (24-360mm equivalent) zoom. It's still in use, but more as a backup camera than anything else now. It has been announced that a new \"bridge\" camera is on the way, the Fujifilm X-S1 Digital Camera, and this one offers a large 2/3-inch 12 MP EXR-CMOS sensor, a 26x manual zoom (24-624mm), and a large 3.0\" titling LCD display, along with many other features. Based on years of use with Fujifilm products going back to the '70s, this one is worth serious consideration, but we'll have to wait until the actual production models appear.Updated May 11, 2013:My Fujifilm S6000fd is still in service, and though it's not frequently in use as much as it once was, it still gets pulled out for casual shots when needed. My 'everyday' camera is the new Fujifilm X20 a 12MP advanced compact digital camera with a truly superb f/2.0- f/2.8 28mm to 112mm (equivalent) 4x optical zoom and more. Am not a brand-loyalty fanatic, but as long as Fujifilm keeps producing cameras like this and the others that I've owned, they stay at the top of my list when considering new digital camera gear.Summary:Simply put, the Fujifilm Finepix S6000fd is an excellent product, even by today's smaller and lighter standards. Have picked up a number of other digital cameras since, and most have been decent, but this one still remains a favorite. It's the camera that I reach for when I have to take a shot on the run and am depending on getting good results. Had I reviewed a few months after purchasing it, would have given it a 5-star rating. And looking over some of the results for the last three years, will let that rating stand.9/17/2010; Updated 1/10/2012 & 5/11/2013", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji Finepix S6000fd", "Author": "Tomer Arazi", "ReviewID": "R7MUSZ6IOA96L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've bought this camera after i've lost my Fuji Finepix S5200/5600.The difference was around $65 and it was totaly worth it! the camera is very high quality, 6.3MP is more than enough, the mechanical zoom/focus ring is great and much easyer to use than an electronic one!I think that for someone who wants to try out photography and not pay the full price of a DSLR+lenses and still wants to enjoy playing with all the feature and to have a similiar feeling this is the perfect camera!Highly recommended.Tomer.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great bridge camera", "Author": "Sven Lehti", "ReviewID": "R29U2NOL0AKI7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  I had a Nikon coolpix with 4 MP resolution, as well as an older Minolta film SLR Camera, and I was looking to upgrade.  I shopped around a little, and decided on this one.  I went to my local camera store and held it in my hand.  It feels just like a solid DSLR; really nice in your hand.  The Auto mode is great, and focusing times are generally short.  The high speed shooting mode is really fast, with absolutely no noticeable shutter lag.  You just have to keep the shutter release button held halfway down as you follow your subject, and then push it all the way down when you're ready to take the picture.  The lens cap stays on really nicely, and the string to attach it to the camera is nice: there is no chance of losing it.  I really like the option to set the controls to full manual, and the manual zoom is way, way superior to the rocker found on most super zoom cameras.  The LCD is easy to see even in daylight.  One thing i really dislike about this camera is the lack of an optical viewfinder.  Fuji employs instead an electronic viewfinder with a fairly low resolution, so looking through it is less effective.  In bright light especially, colors seem washed out through the EVF.  Taking time exposure shots is difficult with this particular camera, because the lens aperture only goes down to 11.  My previous film SLR, on the other hand, got as small as 22, so half the size.  With this Fuji, any time exposures come out very over exposed.  This might be fixable with a dark filter, but I haven't tried it yet.  The movie option is good, and my only complaint would be the fact that you can hear the auto focusing of the lens in the videos.  It's great for small clips, but not for anything much more than that.  But it's a camera, not a camcorder, right?

My previous photographic equipment experience spans 35mm through 120; 4x5, and 8x10 view camera formats; and darkroom work.I currently do not print larger than 8\"x10\", at a minimum of 300 dpi.I am enjoying the camera. Has a good balance of features, good optics, etc.A notable point about this model is its performance (for a non-DSLR)at ISO 400, and in a pinch ISO 800. That combined with its RAW mode and 28mm wide end. I would recommend it to:Someone that does not want to go to DSLR, but is used to film and manual lens work, and wants an all-in-one camera. I am finding mine exspecially nice for general use by hand, and \"street-shooting\". While a beginner can use it, (the program mode is very nice, I would think this model would be most satisfying for a person who has been doing photography for awhile.Pluses for me (so far):28mm wide end.The most recent update of Adobe Photo Raw 4.1 recognizes this camera. That Adobe plug-in is compatable also with Elements 5.0. I do not use the Fuji software at all.RAW mode.A manual zoom ring.The superior performance at mid-ISO (for a \"superzoom), such as 400. I can obtain nice 8x10 in color or B&W;, at that speed. 800 ISO gives you night/street/carnival etc. options that are useful in an informal way.The \"chrome\" mode looks like Fujichrome 50 at about -1/3 stop. Figures I guess. But nice if you are shooting color and used to slide film.Downside:While it has been functioning well, I would pay more if this model/design had more metal in the body, and the tripod socket (it is plastic) were metal.XD cards. 2gb limit. More expensive than SD/CF, etc.While it is not an issue for me, the time lag to write a RAW file is long. If you want to shoot action in RAW, this is not your camera.

I found about it only after a very careful and long research on the internet. There are some very good web sites where you can compare same photos shot with different cameras. Find those web sites and see how great camera this is (this is known as s6500fd in Europe). Canon 5S IS is considered to be the closest competitor to this camera, it's much more expensive than this one, but you will see that even in lower ISOs it takes worse photos. S6000fd is far better than all the digital non-DSLR cameras I have compared, and even better than some cheap DSLRs in some areas. We shouldn't compare it to DSLRs really, but when you do compare it to a DSLR that is twice as expensive, you will be surprised to find out that in some areas 6000fd takes better photos.A few things you need to be aware though: This is not a point-and-shoot camera and it takes terrible photos on Auto mode. But... Just use the P mode, turn the chrome mode on and fix ISO on 100 or 200... That's all... It now does a better job then all point and shoot cameras... Want more than that? Then be patient and read the manual. It's fun to experiment and play with different options as well.Another thing, it's not a pocket size camera. Having said that, it's not heavy at all. The weight and the size actually feels just right when you take a photo. A bit difficult to carry around though.But I was really tired of digital photos that looked like paintings, and this was what the doctor ordered. Crystal clear, sharp photos, perfect colors, still look like real photos on larger prints rather than paintings. If I ever get another camera, it will have to be an expensive DSLR. Only that could compete with this one and be something out of this camera's league.

There's so much to like about this camera... Manual zoom, for one.  I personally can't stand pushbutton zoom cameras, and Fuji makes the only bridge cameras on the market that use manual zoom like a DSLR.  The zoom on the S6000fd is smooth, but quick when you want it to be, such as when you need to zoom in fast on a bird that just landed on a branch or your kid about to kick the soccer ball into the net.  Also the fact that it has a filter ring on the end of the lens is huge for me.  I put a UV/protection lens on to prevent damage to the camera's optics.  Always practice safe photography!  The camera is excellent for macro shots, especially in super macro mode... you can practically touch the subject to the lens and still get a clear shot.  Pictures have always been crisp and clear, and it has a good range of manual features.  RAW mode is nice if you're so inclined.  It has a pretty good bracketing mode, which I have been using often in recent months as I've been exploring HDR photography.  Set the bracketing mode for 1 EV increments and put it in bracketing mode.  Mount it to a tripod, set the timer, compose your shot and stand back while it takes 3 shots at different exposures.  Using software such as Photomatrix, you can then stitch these 3 shots together later on the computer.  This will basically pick the best exposed pixels from each shot and merge them together.  This fixes exposure problems such as the sky being overexposed while the trees are underexposed in a landscape shot.  Purists say HRD is cheating, but if it produces a better final result, who gets hurt?5 years is a very long time for consumer electronics, but I must say, if I were to show my S6000fd to you now, you would think it was a brand-new camera.  It has held up amazingly well, and has accompanied us on many many excursions over the years... hiking, skiing, even kayaking... and is still in just as great shape as the day I bought it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect; the EVF is pretty grainy, the LCD display is a bit small by today's standards, and it lacks some of the gadgetry that has been developed in recent years, such as auto-panorama mode and built in HDR.  But it was pretty state of the art for its time, and has held up so well that it's hard for me to give it anything other than 5 stars.  I recently got the itch for a new camera with a higher pixel count and some of the new fancy features.  After months of research, I came back to Fujifilm, and purchased the HS20, which is basically the newest descendant in the same family as the S6000fd.  So far so good with the HS20, but I'm left with a dilemma.  I told myself I'd sell the S6000fd to help defray the cost of the new HS20, but now I'm realizing that the S6000fd has been such a good and loyal companion, I'm having trouble parting with it!", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its legendary in my eyes", "Author": "powerop", "ReviewID": "R3F7UZW4RZMVT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that this is an excellent camera. I've owned other types in the past, most notably the Canon T2i and Pentax k-x DSLRs, and enthusiast level Panasonix lx3 compact camera, but this (now dis-continued) bridge camera still finds its way as choice camera for travel and everyday use. The image is very sharp, crisp, and vibrant for this long zoom range. An equivalent lens on a DLSR is very hard to find, if not non-existent, to keep sharp throughout the focal length, not to mention very expensive. Distortion is very low - good for architecture (and surprising for thie zoom range). Handles flare admirably, though chromatic aberration is about average. Glass lens are nicely coated, accepts popular (and inexpensive) 58mm filters, uitilizes a manual zoom thats very useful for quiet video recording, and has a powerful flash. Handling is outstanding, operation is quick, battery life is great, ISO performance follows closely to the legendary fuji F30 (same sensor, different noise reduction algorithm), and features RAW (to get same quality as legendary F30). AUto white balance is smart and spot-on in incadescant lighting, which helps a lot for low-light indoor shots. If it wasn't for the lack of optical stabilization and optical viewfinder, this camera would have been my idea of perfect.

My only complaint is that it's a bit heavy and bulky, but then it feels like a real camera and has that very useful 10x manual zoom.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great Camera", "Author": "Richard Israel \"R sunsets\"", "ReviewID": "R3UUNMVH4RVW6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When all things are considered, this is a great camera for the anyone not needing to blow pic,s out larger than 10x12, the manual with this product is much better than with most over sea,s Manuals. shutter response can be improved by reading the manual and using the camera as it was designed, it is not the last answer to everyone with only 6.3 mgd pixils,just shoot at max dpi,with a 1gd card and recharge the batts, and you will learn to love it.as a update to this review I have learned that the camera works best,using the \"P\" setting and keeping the IOS setting at 400 or below the auto setting pick,s too high a IOS and the pic,s come out grainy or spotty.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "rayman416", "ReviewID": "RTBGJ16AJON1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Fuji F31fd which is the best compact on the planet, and now the S6000fd zoom.

On paper, this camera looks like a real winner:  uses the same CCD found in my Fuji F30 (a great little camera), a nice 10.7x zoom with a wode angle of 28mm, flash sits high (reduces chance of red eye), and the manual zoom (end up liking that better than I thought I would), but after testing the camera at my local store I was decided against purchasing the unit.While the basic control layout is the same as the F30, there were a few differences in ISO settings, reviewing pictures, and such that made this camera feel a little more awkward than the F30.  Also, the camera is larger than and heavier than I had expected.  These items by themselves were not show stoppers, but did catch my attention.The real problems came in with the cameras picture quality.  While I have had excellent results with the F30, I had all sorts of focusing issues with the S6000 -- especially at the long end of the zoom.  Test picture after test picture would not focus.  In addition, the pictures on the pictures that did focus, the colors were not as sharp as the F30 and the noise reduction appears to be more aggresive (loss of detail) at the higher ISO settings than the F30.The other major issue is the lack of optical image stabilzation with the camera.  I knew that the camera did not have this feature when I was looking and given the results I had from my F30, I thought the bump in ISO would not be a big issue (the camera bumps up the ISO setting to adjust for camera movement).  With the 'image stabilization' setting, the ISO was set to AUTO and usually choose ISO 3200, which has a very negative affect on picture quality.In the end, the focusing issues and lack of OIS were showstoppers and I gave up the superior flash and ISO capabilities of this unit and purchased a Canon S3 IS.I really hope Fuji can add OIS in the next upgrade to this line and fix some of the focusing/image issues, because I think they would have the best non-DSLR zoom camera on the market with these features.  Until then, I am very happy with both my Fuji F30 and the Canon S3 IS.", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT STARTER CAMERA", "Author": "Steven E.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R36KXR32CRM9VR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a replacement for my Canon A80.  I wanted something with a long zoom lens to give more flexibility in taking outdoor shots and pictures of my kids at their events where I cannot get close.Physically the camera feels very comfortable;  it's ergonomics are great thanks to the large hand grip and lens.  Controls were easy and logical.  I didn't think I'd like the manual zoom, but I actually think I'd prefer it to the \"powered\" zoom as it is faster and more accurate.I'm no \"prosumer\" - just someone that likes to take pictures and, as such, I need something that isn't going to require complex adjustments before pressing the shutter.  This is where most of my problems with this camera came in.Performance indoors was spotty at best.  Even though I was taking relatively close up shots indoors (i.e. not using long zoom), I had substantial issues with image blur.  I'm not sure this is due to the lack of image stabilization (I thought that only helped when taking distant shots), I just know it was a problem.  In many instances, the auto-focus clunked and whirred before taking the shot (even when pre-focusing by pressing the shutter button halfway), resulting in several missed opportunities at my son's birthday party.  Nonetheless, some of the pictures it took were excellent, with incredible clarity.  Again - I'm no camera expert, but since I'm using the \"Auto\" mode on a high priced auto-focus camera, I don't expect to make calculations and adjustments to get a good picture.  I'm not sure if I COULD have done so with this camera, but requiring me to do so would be asking more than I'm willing to do.I was sold on this camera by the excellent reviews on this site, but I definitely had the opposite experience.  If you're the \"point and shoot\" type and not a \"prosumer\", I would recommend you look at some of the other alternatives.  Personally I returned this camera to Amazon for a refund (which they handled flawlessly).  I'll be trying the Canon S3 due to my very positive past experience with Canon.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "High quality camera!", "Author": "Hidekazu Matsuno \"Hawaiian Sun\"", "ReviewID": "RKF0OUH7XUHLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Price is low, then quality is high.My doughter take photo almost everyday.little bit bigger size camera but photo quality is much nicer than other compact camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Christmas Gift", "Author": "Carol J.
