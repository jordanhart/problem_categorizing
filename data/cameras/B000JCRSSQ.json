I wanted more pixels (10MP vs 4MP), a larger LCD screen (~3x larger than S400), faster powerup (>2x as fast), wider ISO range (ISO 3200 max vs ISO 400 max), faster shot-to-shot times, better user interface, scratch-resistant case material (titanium), same or smaller size/weight and SD memory cards (new laptop has an SD reader).  The top-of-the-line Canon SD900 titanium-clad wundercam delivers the goods; but not without a few caveats. The titanium case is gorgeous and virtually scratch-proof; but it's quite slippery and provides no discernable perch for fingers. (I've gotten used to it.) On the first few powerups, it sounded like the lens gears were grinding and jumping teeth or something: The usual \"whir\" sound was very loud, with strange clicking sounds.  I almost returned the camera; but it appears to work fine.JPEG compression artifacts are quite visible, especially at the \"Fine\" quality setting (~2-3 MB file size). The huge 10.0 megapixel CCD produces oceans of detail; but it is very noisy at high ISO settings.  At lowest aperature (f2.8), some lens softness and purple fringing is visible in certain scenes. At higher aperatures and longer focal lengths, images are razor-sharp. The SD900 has no image stabilization; but I was able to take handheld shots in extremely low light conditions with no problem.  This camera is small enought to carry with you at all times, in the pocket, the purse, the briefcase, the glovebox, always at the ready when that perfect photo opportunity presents itself. It doesn't matter now great your camera is if you don't have it with you to capture those priceless photos.

Chin \"Silvier\"", "ReviewID": "R35VEE57PVWVE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself a photography enthusiast and a bit of an electronics geek.  I love looking at the latest and greatest gadgets and often end up telling myself that I HAVE to have them especially when it comes to digital cameras.  I've owned 3 sony digital cameras all of which were pretty popular models (p10, t7, n1).  Although my sony cameras were always very sleek and stylish, they always fell short when it came to taking pictures of my cats and of the children I work with.  If you know cats and kids, then you know they NEVER stay still.  My pics often came out blurry and the settings always had to be adjusted to take a decent picture.  A forced flash always had to be on in order to catch a decent pose and the color of the picture would never look natural.  I also thought the newer sony models would solve these problems but after my 3rd sony, I only saw minimal improvement.  I was a bit hesitant to switch brands but after fiddling with a couple of canon's from friends, I decided it was time to switch.After having this camera for about a month and a half, I don't think I can ever go back to a sony.  To say the SD900 is awesome would be an understatement.  It is by far the most versatile camera I've ever used.  It takes beautiful pictures in low light, indoor, and outdoor settings, but what sets this camera apart is that it takes great pictures of constantly moving objects like cats and kids in these backdrops as well!  The colors are rich and natural, not washed out by the flash like my sony cameras.  The images are crisp in detail and even in light distribution.  With the high ISO setting on the camera, you can take beautiful indoor shots without a flash that no other camera can handle.  The battery life is good and the lag between pushing the button and actually having the photo take isn't bad.  There are faster cameras out there that are quicker in response time but the quality pictures I keep getting from this camera is more than enough to overlook this.My sony n1 took great video but often had a hard time keeping focus on the subject matter. It would constantly go in and out of focus and make it difficult to watch sometimes.  The SD900 totally blows the n1 out of the water when it comes to taking quality videos.  The videos are crystal clear even when cats or kids are running around wild which is something I never experienced with a sony camera.I still prefer the sony interface and screen layout.  Maybe that's just because I'm so used to it.  The canon doesn't have the battery indicator that tracks battery life down to the minute nor does it have the storage gauge to let you know how full the memory card is at all times like the sonys.  It's a bit annoying at times to not have these features but its no deal breaker.Overall, it's a great camera.  It's a little bit on the expensive side because its canon's top of the line model.  If you want something cheaper but don't want to give up the stellar performance, you should go with the SD630.  I had that camera and after playing with it for a few weeks, I was thoroughly convinced that it was time to be a canon believer.  I now see the light.  If you want to see some of the awesome things the sd900 can do, view customer images and you'll see pictures of my cat that i took way up close.  Keep in mind that these photos were not cropped or altered in any way by photo software.  If you try to take a picture this close up with a sony, all you'll get is a blurry image.  I hope this review was helpful and that you'll join me and all the other converts to the canon promise land.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Pocket  Digital I've Ever Owned!", "Author": "Readalots", "ReviewID": "R35O4LJ4GBXH0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a life-long camera buff (for that history see my Amazon review on the Nikon P-1 Coolpix).  Recently, I upgraded from the P-1 (purchased in January of 2006) to the new Canon SD-900 Power Shot \"Digital Elph\".  What a change!My wife has been shooting a Canon SD-550 for two years and her happy experience helped me to choose Canon's latest pocket digital.  This \"Elph's\" 10.0 mega pixel, 3X zoom lens is dramatically different from the various cameras I have used!Although there are many items to be praised with this newest Power Shot a few are particularly noteworthy.  Thankfully, Canon has retained the Power Shot's titanium housing.  Scratched camera is only a memory.  The \"AF-assistance Beam\" is very accurate.  With 100s of photos taken so far, there are no \"blurry shots\".  It is a delight to stretch its ISO to 3200 (we're ready for those lava tubes)!  The brilliant customize self-timer option creates a new versatility (four shots over 15 seconds considerably reduces the probability of subjects' closed eyes).This Power Shot's 10 mega pixels print out in vivid accuracy and bold portrayal.  Our photos are stunning!  The SD-900 also features Canon's signature one-piece (without a chord) battery charger.  The large display sees everything photographed.  This Elph takes less time to record the photo to the disk (the Coolpix is a dinosaur in comparison).  And although both cameras weigh about the same, the SD-900 is slightly smaller than the P-1 (and fits better into pockets, back packs, and suit cases).The Canon SD-900 Power Shot is a great camera and an excellent gift candidate.  It is recommended to the camera pros and novices.Happy New Year!!", "Date": "January 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "wow", "Author": "Bart Mccoy \"rev. bart\"", "ReviewID": "R3AW27UT42T5L9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I just got this camera and have only taken about 200 pics so far but am very impressed. I won't go over all the stuff that's already been talked about but I will say that it's a huge improvement. The 10 megapixels may at first seem like overkill but when you see the results you'll understand the potential of this tiny camera. It's great actually being able to take really nice photos with a digital zoom for once, not to mention how beautiful the regular 3X zoom is. Great optics and great color over the sd700 IS, which I'm upgrading from. Also much improved menus and useability. The digic III is awesome, it's fast and the facial recognition is really cool. There is'nt a whole lot of drawbacks, Image stabilization would be nice, but I never want those crummy sd700 is optics again. Flash is a little weak, but it always has been on these.

Wolter", "ReviewID": "R2ISR6W0RAEEPU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "... I don't recommend getting it.First the good: This is the fifth digital camera I have owned and it is the one I liked best: It looks good, is small enough to carry around, and takes great pictures and movies. I did not have a problem with the fact that it does not have an image stabilizer, it still takes better pictures in almost all situations than my Panasonic Lumix DMC (which has one). The LCD display is good in all light conditions I experienced and seems robust enough in spite of its size. I've also found the camera easy to use.Now the bad: 7 months after I purchased the camera, the lens stopped retracting and the screen displayed \"Lens Error\". I checked on the internet and found that thousands of other people had this problem (also known as the E18 error) with the Canon Powershot cameras. I called the Canon repair center and they immediately recognized the problem and told me to send the camera in for repair. Several days later I received a repair estimate for $157 even though the camera was still covered by a 1 year guarantee. When calling the repair center I was told that the camera had scratches on the exterior and they would not honor the warranty. That's consistent with what I read on the internet: Canon is very reluctant to deal with the error.To me it seemed that the scratches on the exterior were entirely unrelated to the lens error. The camera has been handled with regular care and I've never had a similar problem with other cameras.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "There are BETTER choices than the SD900!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R1XRT99X7VBCKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"I LOVE THIS CAMERA,\" stated by one of my friends who purchased his Canon SD900 last week ago.Last weekend ago, I remember playing with my best friend Canon SD900 digital camera. I was amaze by the fit-n-finish of this product...meaning, the quality of how this camera came about. This camera simply had it all - 10mp, awesome photos, amazing features, etc!! But what was wrong with the Canon SD900?One thing that I was quite disappointed was how the camera only had a 3x the optical zoom level. I own a Canon SD800 camera, and my camera actually has a 3.8x the optical zoom level. This means that I could zoom in far more closer into a specific object or action with the Canon SD800 than the Canon SD900.The second thing was that the Canon SD800 had the image-stabilized wide zoom. This means that when I zoom into an object or thing, I could rotate my lens of my camera to make the picture focus more on one specific object than just one whole picture in itself. Like the SD800, the SD900 does NOT have that feature. This means that for the SD900, not only do you have fewer optical zoom level than the SD800, but you also can't adjust the quality of the picture/object while taking photos on your SD900.Lastly, I took a couple of photos in the SD800 and SD900. When comparing the quality of each pictures, I found quite surprisingly that the 7mp photo and the 10mp pictures were VERY similar. There wasn't much change in the picture quality of these two cameras. YES, the SD900 do have more mega-pixels than the SD800, but I found out that there wasn't much of a difference between those two cameras in terms of quality photos.In simple words, there is NOTHING wrong with the SD900. I just think that if you are debating between whether to buy the SD800 or the SD900, I believe the SD800 would be a better choice than the SD900. A 10mp camera doesn't have much difference from a 7mp camera. I believe that the SD800 simply lets the individual have more control on how they want there photos to come out to be than the SD900.But to not make any judgments here, I believe that the SD800, in MY opinion, is better than the SD900.", "Date": "March 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "SHUTTER VOLUME", "Author": "G.

Hard to beat!", "Author": "K. Cook", "ReviewID": "R23QUMVTMIO9OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this great little camera yesterday. I always enjoy reading all the opinions of others and certainly felt comfortable buying this after reading all the excellent comments.  Of course there will always be some who can find something wrong with anything and I truly feel that is perfectly OK, however, most of the negative comments I have read pertain to things I feel any buyer should investigate \"BEFORE\" the purchase is made and not afterward.  For example, this really is a small camera.  My hands have a tough time getting around all the little controls and staying out of the way of the lens, sensors and controls, however, the more I used it, the more comfortable I felt with it.  Some had said it is too large!  Go figure!A few have referred to having another, more expensive camera with options to change lens, etc.  I also fall into this category.  I have a great Canon 20 D camera which I absolutely love, however, our smaller first generation Kodak was beginning to fade a bit so we decided to get this one as an alternative to packing in the serious and more bulky 20 D.  Now my wife is claiming she will keep the new SD900 in her purse so she is taking my promise to make this \"her camera\" a little too seriously.  I hope she will grow tired of it and I will occasionally get the chance to use it a bit more.Now, getting down to the actually purpose of this review, I have only spent a few hours last evening and this morning \"fiddling\" with the camera.  I am very impressed with both the software and hardware elements of the camera.  The pictures have been great.  I have really about run out of things to take pictures of around the house, however, I have some wonderful pictures of the dogs, flowers and patio.  I have snapped away at some rather lame subjects just to test this thing out and I have come away with some truly excellent quality shots.  I love the \"macro\" mode.  You can start at two inches from the flower (or whatever) and get lots of great detail.  My Canon 20 D will not do this without a special \"macro\" lens.One of the most outstanding things I love about the 20 D is the ability to take pictures at plays or concerts without using the flash.  Of course most places will run you off if you use flash, even the grade school crowd  will frown at you firing off your flash every few minutes and it usually is nothing more than a waste of effort in the first place as most flashes are really not much good beyond a few feet.  So, point being, I have always defaulted to 1600 ASA or, perhaps even 3200 ASA and not had to use flash at all.  Yes, some might say the shot will be a little grainy (noisy) at the higher speeds and I have not yet tried out the new SD900 in low light situations, however, I expect that it will offer us many more options by having the same ability to move up to the higher 1600 and 3200 ASA settings as I have used with my more expensive Canon.  I have printed many shots at 13 X 19 inches and have had very few issues with grain or noise.  I think having this as an option on the SD900 is one of the most attractive options.  You can do a lot of shooting in limited light situations without flash if your camera has the higher ASA options.This camera, like many of the newer cameras on the market today, has lots of other options which I have not yet explored.  I certainly do not have great expectations when it comes to a lot of latitude when shooting in \"manual\" modes but this is really not what this camera is about.  Yes, you can shoot manual but I am not actually planning on doing much with this camera in this mode;  maybe we will but it seems to be doing such a great job in the several \"auto modes\" that I figure will we be doing lots quick shooting and not take the time to use the manual modes....of course this is just my initial review after having the camera a grand total of one day so I am a far cry from speaking with absolute conviction and knowledge.  Hopefully we will know much more after a trip or two and having more than the neighborhood flowers and dogs as subjects!Bottom line, great little camera.  It seems to me that we have a bit of a learning curve before understanding  what all the different warning lights, etc. mean, however, if we just keep it set up in to \"auto mode\" we will likely never need to know all of that in the first place.  It's certainly not a cheap camera and seems to be rather solid so I expect to try out everything it has to offer in the next few months.One more thing.  The \"movie option\" seems to work fine.  I currently have a two gig card in the camera and can see it will be needed if we shoot a lot of video movies, however, shooting the highest \"JPG\" quality still shots will give us more than 500 pictures per card so I suspect we will be very pleased with this 2 gig card. Not to end on a negative, however, including a 32 meg memory card with this fine little camera is really not much of a perk!

And due to the scrutiny of the forums, I immediately had to test it. I compared exact duplicate shots from my SD550 to this \"upgrade\" sd800. I am very sad to say that in normal shooting conditions, this model just couldn't keep up. The main things I saw the sd800 losing horribly to the sd550 in were: picture clarity, sharpness (edge to edge) and color accuracy (the sd800's produces a very warm shot, too much yellow & red). This was a disappointment indeed when you compare the fact that my sd550 is almost a year old.Now, on the flip-side, and should you ever find yourself in \"overhead fan lighting,\" this will be where the true benefits of the sd800 become VERY clear. If this is how you shoot, the IS will become a lifesaver for every single shot. But aside from a museum or other \"no flash,\" location, RARELY am I not using the flash on my camera. And I found the trick to not having over-saturation or too much flash contrast (whatever the model) is to just lower the brightness setting prior to shooting and use a bit of Photoshop shadow highlight love. (Although this can never fully prevent your shot from the flashlight effect left on objects from shooting, but it helps). This camera is only ideal for shooting in an IS situation. Period. Or at least IMHO, but it is my review right? lolMy solution was simple. I ended up taking a risk against better judgment, returned the sd800, and got the sd900. Let me just say that the quality from this camera will NEVER be achievable from an SD800. So make the call. If IS is your \"make or break feature,\" go for the 700is, or800is.

So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store).We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich.The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it.

That said there are still things which bother me about the Canon's, but not enough to go with another brand. This SD900 has a host of great features, but even though the list is long and looks fancy, they things which will probably never get used; such as color swap (fun, but silly and something that I can do in post editing), and most of the special color and scene modes, and slide show modes. And really who needs a 10MP snapshot, yes the resolution is great and makes for nice pics, but it means each photo takes up about 3 or 4 MB, for general use that's a waste of hard drive.The biggest problem I have found with all previous PowerShots is the flash just isn't strong enough to illuminate much beyond a couple feet and with the flash off you run into blurry pics because the sensor is too small to capture enough light (Sony has a much better time at this from what I have seen). Anyway with the SD900 I was finally impressed with the throw of the flash! It is bright, strong, and, for it's size, powerful enough to illuminate a small room, much better than previous models.The one thing I don't care for as much is the SD900's size. It's quite a bit larger and noticeably heavier than my previous SD300. The SD300 fit slimly in my pocket and I carried it everywhere and took allot of snapshots. The SD900 isn't nearly as compact as I would like. While it's an upgrade in quality and style, it's a downgrade in portability.

Mueller", "ReviewID": "R13GSIXF455ADC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched many digital cameras before deciding to get this model. I chose it because it had the high megapixels that I wanted and boasted many features and unique settings. I was not disappointed.First of all, the camera offers sharp, high-quality images without using any of the fancy settings. The basic use of this camera meets my expectations.The Color Accent feature is something that makes me feel like an artist as I compose images, and it is very easy to use (words which I will be using several times during this review!). The same effect can be done by hand with Photoshop or Gimp, but why worry about that high-end, expensive software when your camera does it for you?The other feature that I am currently giddy about and excited to try on our upcoming vacation is the panorama feature and the accompanying software, StitchAssist. I had a camera that offered assistance lining up panoramic shots, but did not come with software to put those images together. The Canon SD 900 comes with StitchAssist, a program with imports the images taken with the panoramic setting on and then \"stitches\" them together. The program does all the work; all I had to do was tell it which images I wanted put together. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was.Another minor setting I like is the touch button display. I have always had trouble operating the tiny buttons on my previous compact digital cameras, but the SD900 has a display that pops up when you press the round buttons to help you verify that you are pushing the correct button. No more trying to turn off the flash, but setting the macro instead!One aspect that I am still learning is navigating the menus. The basic camera menus change very slightly depending on which settings you have enabled, and I am afraid that when I am \"out in the field\" away from my user guide, I won't be able to remember how to make the camera do what I want because I can't remember how to get to the menu. This is a necessary evil of a feature-packed camera, I fear. The menus are intuitive, though, so they have been fairly easy to learn. Not so with some cameras I have used.I am not very pleased with the built-in sounds (I find almost all of them annoying), but you have the option of turning them completely off, as well as the option to set the volume of each type of sound individually, so I feel like Canon partially redeemed themselves for the less-than-pleasing-to-the-ear audio they offered.One sound I am glad Canon included was one that signals the timer is about to go off. Again, no sounds that don't make your heart race, but at least we can all tell when that group shot is going to snap.I strongly recommend this camera if you are looking for a small camera packed with easy to use features.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very happy with our new camera.", "Author": "R.

I love the digital SLR but it is too bulky for me to tote around for everyday photos. I decided to purchase the Canon SD900 after my Nikon Coolpix died after 5 years of daily use. I've been using the SD900 for 2 weeks now and love it. The SD900 sold me on its tiny size, huge display, 10 MP photos, different ISO settings and the various movie modes. It fits perfectly into  my smallest purse and into pockets. It is a little heavier than the Nikon Coolpix I had, but that is due to the solid construction. I have small hands and the camera is easy for me to hold--no straining or slippage. Another sell point for me was the rechargeable battery--I charge it once a week and I am set for an hour or so a day of photo taking. On sightseeing trips I prefer to charge it every other day.The only thing that annoys me about the camera is the slowness of clicking through the Manual menu settings to set up the white balance, exposure, ect. Something about the way the menus are set up seems less intuitive than on the Nikon Coolpix or the Digital Rebel SLR. It's not unexpected on such a tiny camera but for the price point I expected just a little more.The SCN settings are very handy and easy to chose from, and the automatic setting works well when in a hurry to capture a shot. I love the face detect feature--it makes framing the subjects a piece of cake.The movie modes are a fun option. I find them useful to take little clips of the kids to send to the grandparents.

It is not a perfect camera, but it is great for my needs.  The main components that make it a good camera for me:1.  Being able to use either the screen or the optical viewer -- so few cameras have that last option, including most of the Canon P&S; cameras.2.  Camera shake control, which allows me to get sharper images.3.  Size and weight enables me to carry it in my pocket or purse.The images can be enlarged quite a bit for a P&S;, and the zoom feature is adequate to capture most scenes.  I take snap shots of family and friends, but also capture some pretty nice scenics with this camera.  It has a lot of manual features, which I have not begun to use enough.  I had been used to Canon EOS Elan I and II film cameras, so changing to digital was a new experience.  For photos I shoot these days, this P&S; is adequate for my needs, even though I miss the SLRs and the darkroom.I already knew this camera, as I was replacing one just like it that got \"frozen\" and unusable, and that one had replaced a Canon SD700 Elph, which had fallen into the ocean surf with me, but which I liked very much.For the serious photographer, this would be an easy backup, but of course, the SLR would be better.  For the more casual photographer, this camera takes very quality shots.Downside?  It is slow.  I often miss those quick shots of someone or something moving.

The titanium case is beautiful and I have never had it fail to boot. But the constantly irritating problems are two:1. If you zoom out fully or zoom in fully, the shot button becomes unusable. You have to undo the zoom just a little bit in order to \"free up\" the button. But when you do that, the zoom frequently has a mind of its own and will continue to zoom so you have to start over.2. Flash shots in either auto mode or manual can cause \"blackout\" as the camera tries to compensate for an over-exposed shot. Instead of getting a slightly washed out shot or one where you want to illuminate recessed areas of an item with a light colored or reflective surface, the result is a shot far too dark to salvage with even Photoshop.Frequently, while trying to access settings, nothing happens. Turning off and turning on will not help. Removing the battery and reinserting it generally solves the problem.When I spoke to a representative I was told that there might be a circuitry problem, and like another reviewer, I was to pack it up, ship it out and for around $130.00 they might be able to solve the problem.When it works, under normal circumstances, it takes great shots. Clear and well defined. The upper ISO settings are grainy. One of the appealing advertised features was the ability to capture items in motion. If it only loaded fast enough.

I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900.

I took it out to San Francisco for day trip and after taking only 15 photos or so, the lens made a noise and didn't retract.

I'd just gotten the feeling that Canon was starting to produce better optics than Sony, and that there products were superior.  I chose the PowerShot SD900 because of its small profile, the titanium body, its 10 megapixel capability and, frankly, all of the postive reviews I saw on Amazon praising its razor-sharp imaging and ease of use.  I'd seen images from a SD600 that were not great, but I assumed that the SD900 was a later generation and that some of the imaging problems had been fixed.After having used this camera for a few weeks, and actually spending the money to get the WP-DC7 waterproof case, I'm quite disappointed.  Pictures shot with the SD900 are perpetually blurry and loaded with compression artifacts.  I'm not a professional photographer, so my first assumption was that I was the problem.  But I've made all the expected adjustments to correct this - changing the ISO settings, changing the exposure, shooting on full manual.Even images where light is optimal with a completely still subject and using a tripod, I can't get this camera to produce the same quality of image that the DSC-V1 did.  Images are far from razor sharp, and the color is off.  Sure, I can cook the pictures with Photoshop, which I regularly do, but you can't make a blurry picture clear through software.  I can only surmise that I'm used to shooting with a Sony camera equipped with Carl Zeiss optics, and that the Canon's lens simply doesn't deliver the same picture consistently.  I'm tempted to go with a less compact Canon with a larger lens, but after this experience, the odds of my returning this camera and going back to Sony are high.", "Date": "February 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "A joy to use!", "Author": "Naromiyocknowhusunkatank", "ReviewID": "RGSEQ5N2GOUFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Reviewed with the SanDisk extreme III 2.0 GB SD memory card (optional) installed.Over twice as fast as the SD20 ultra compact.
