We also have a Canon 7D and really love it, but it is much larger and heavier than the T3i. So far I have seen no difference between the two cameras in the quality of the photos taken. The T3i seems to focus faster than the 7D, but it may be the lens. I will swap them and see if that makes a difference. In any event, both of these cameras are in my opinion well made and take supurb photos. Also one thing is for sure, I have made many purchaces through Amazon and have yet to have a problem, delivery was usually before promised. Even if I returned an item I was unhappy with it was taken care of.

So after my Google search I found this listing online and thought it too good to be true.I had my boyfriend check it out and we made the purchase. I received my order before the estimated delivery time and everything was intact.For the accessories and the quality of the camera you cannot beat it.
