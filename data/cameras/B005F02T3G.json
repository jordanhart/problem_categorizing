Checked with Olympus customer service in Netherlands (as I am currently located here). They say I need to pay 160 EUR for repair and shipping cost. I just checked that on Amazon, the new EPL3 product is selling for 350 USD with 17mm lens. The 17mm 2.8 lens sells for 300 USD if separately bought. So the new body cost is 50 USD, but to repair old one it is 250 USD :).In any case, I read several forums that many EPL3 are affected by the same issue. There is some capacitor which dies after few months and this problem comes. So it is all luck based. Anyway bad customer service from Olympus is bad. I-------------------------------------------------------Original review in Dec 2011:I have been a user of Olympus E-520 for three years and used Nikon D60, Canon 450D few times as well, besides trying out LX5 and other P&S.;I like EPL3 mainly because compared to my existing E-520, it is half the size and weight but performance has doubled or tripled, though price remained relatively constant. (Good Technology PLC management I guess)My requirements were small size/weight, good quality JPEG photos (no time for RAW). Options were Sony NEX's, Nikon's new J1/V1, Panasonic's GF3's, Fuji X100'sAfter going through the detailed JPEG comparisons on dpreview.com among the different options, to my Olympus trained eyes, I found the quality of EPL3/EP3/EPM1's much better for photos in the range of ISO 100 to ISO 800. Beyond ISO 800/1600, NEX rules. Some may find the quality of NEX in the lower ISO range preferable but I found they are bit soft and also NEX lacks much needed lens support. Fuji though better was beyond my budget and it had issues of focus and only fixed lens support.Considering my usage is mostly during daytime for streets and scenery, I went for EPL-3 with 17mm lens. Among EPL3, EP3 and EPM1 though image quality is same, I chose EPL3 because it has just enough number of buttons, movable LCD for street photography, and due to the single 17mm lens that came with the deal. I wish if someone sells PEN's with 20mm Panasonic lens then it would be an ideal camera.After using the camera, I found the fast focus quite good, also as expected very good JPEG daylight performance and more than expected night time performance.I did not like the camera grip though, as the 400 grams camera is quite slippery due to the smooth metal finish. So, I am thinking of taking a Flipbac FBG3 grip for it and paste it on the front. Video auto focus is also a bit jerky at the start of a shoot. May be I have to still fidget with some settings.For cover, I have taken \"OP/TECH USA 7401114 Soft Pouch -Digital D-Small\", but it was too loose for it. I have ordered Marumi 37mm circular Polaroid filter and yet to receive.Finally, I think, P&S; with small CCD lens will soon die except the ultrazoomers. M4/3 will do well, due to the small package size, excellent lens support and day time performance. For professional photography, DSLRs and lens from Nikon's and Canon's are still THE gear. Sony's NEX have some work to do in terms of lens support. Fuji is for the rich. Samsung is still new. Not sure who buys Ricoh/Pentax/Leica'sUpdate: It is not ergonomic to my hands. I have modified the camera design and uploaded to the product pictures. See Amazon's product picture for more info.Update: I bought an mft 45mm Oly f1.8 lens in Singapore Airport for around 350 USD :-) (lower than Amazon). The portraits are coming out rather very well.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Cheezr", "ReviewID": "R2YD5CEFCZD2OL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a small but excellent camera with great image quality and very competitive for the price.It does lack a built in flash and it is \"last year's\" sensor so anything 1600 ISO and above has noticeable noise but the touch screen is easy to use and the image quality (with the above qualifiers) is very very good.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great first impressions", "Author": "sandsmith", "ReviewID": "R2KAS5ZRJTNZOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the E-PL3 for a couple of days and my first impressions are that it is an excellent camera.  The build is solid, and the overall presentation pleasing.  (I am going to add a Flipbac stick-on grip, and a wrist-strap for still better handling.)  Despite some reviews I found the menus fairly easy to manage although they are many and detailed.  I have taken significantly better photographs than with the Canon S95 point-and-shoot which has been my mainstay for some time, and is top of the line in its class.  Low light performance of the E-PL3 is terrific.  This is a fine introduction to the micro-four-thirds technologies and the higher Olympus models are in consideration for future upgrades.I opted for two fixed length lenses, the 17 mm f2.8 and the 45 mm f1.8 rather than the kit zoom.  My take is that with modern photo editing you can zoom and crop that way, and take advantage of the (supposed) better quality of the prime lenses.  With the 17 mm attached the camera is almost pocketable.  The 45 mm lens has got great reviews and has delivered superb portraits already - at f1.8 the shallow depth of field enhances all, and is impossible to get with a point and shoot.  Of course this lens  costs as much as the camera but I am persuaded by the results that it is worth it.So far so good.  I am going on a trip soon and we shall see  how this combination functions while travelling or if I need to be seduced by a zoom lens.  I will update this review accordingly.Update after travel.Well, the 17 mm lens is not quite wide enough even with manual zooming (walking backwards), and the 45 mm is fine but limited for travel shots.  As my wife said, changing lenses in the middle of the street is \"just old\".  So I eat my words and will try the 14-150 mm zoom which by all accounts will meet my travel requirements. I found a used zoom for half price.The camera itself performed very well although I have to say the screen was pretty useless in sunlight. (I don't really want to spring for an EVF).  Also the battery goes from full to empty in a couple of shots so carry a spare.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Portable excellence", "Author": "Sidney W.
