{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing Camera, very happy with purchase", "Author": "kdkns", "ReviewID": "RW5ZUAIPP828R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I'm an amateur photographer and just started getting back into photography. I started with a digital camera with manual controls, other lenes, etc... and then moved off to a simple point and shoot camera. This is the first SLR type camera that I have owned and the difference is huge between quality of photos and being able to take certain shots ( Arguable, but manual controls and different lenses on SLR do help )Physical:The body feels very solid and has a good weight. It doesn't feel like a plastic toy and feels like a very sold build quality. Even the flaps for batteries and SD Memory Card are very well made.Button placement at first feels odd but once you've learned the menu system and how to use them it works well.The kit lenses works very well in most situations. The only time you may want to use a different lens is in indoors with poor/dim lighting. It also feels as solid as the camera body and the manual focus/zoom wheels all turn smoothly and stay put when set.Using the Camera:At first like most things there is a learning curve but you can be up and taking photos as soon as the batteries are in and putting it on AUTO PICT mode. Before I purchased the camera I had read complaints on how the menu's wording of items was a bit strange, but honestly they are not hard to figure out and it is spelled out in the manual as to what they are. In fact it's easer just to go ahead and click it and see what it does. There are few of these in the menu but everything else is very clear.Taking photos is easy and similar to any other digital camera. Depending on the mode you are in you can adjust Exposure/Shutter Speed/Aper/ISO/etc...Another large complaint against the camera is the burst mode only allows you to take no more than 5 JPEGS ( Highest Quality ) or 3 RAW images before slowing down significantly. This is true, however, depending on your needs this may not matter. If you need to be able to take more than 5  shots at a time then you may want to look at another camera. I took a risk and found that it more than meets my needs.l I was able to take multiple shots of pets/bees/etc just fine with 5 high quality photos or 3 RAW images without any problems.The viewfinder contains information that is listed on the top LCD and can also be viewed on the LCD on the back of the camera. All very easy to read and see once you understand where each item is placed.Quality of PhotosExcellent. That's it. One exception though is in the AUTO PICT mode. It works well but I found that you get better photos in either the P ( Program Mode ) or by going to SCENE mode and picking out a scene type like  pets, sunset, etc...Other issuesEverything about the camera has far exceeded my expectations and all my photos have very crisp, sharp detail and color. To help shoot indoors I purchased the Pentax 50mm f1.4 lenses which is around $200 at the time of this writing. Excellent lens which makes indoor/low light photography/fast action shots a breeze. It will allow you to take more light in which will allow you to shoot at a faster shutter speed ( The faster the shutter speed -> less light into camera -> darker photo ). I highly recommend purchasing this lens if you plan on doing portraits or indoor photos with low lighting.Summary:Pros:Excellent photos, build quality, easy to use controls, can be used by beginner to advanced. Remember, no matter how great the camera, the person still should know some photography basics like how to set exposure, this will help anyone get great shots from any camera.Cons:Burst mode only allows 5 Jpegs or 3 RAW, but may depend on person if this matters.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pentax: Always the Best!", "Author": "J Anthony \"tinglassman\"", "ReviewID": "R2JMTHSY4PV87G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're an avid photographer (which means you love to take photos) or you're new to digital SLRs and you're ready to make the move to a digital SLR, then the Pentax K100D Super is a top choice.For those use to operating a typical 35mm film SLR, the switch to digital is fairly easy.  I've been a Pentax guy for over 20 years: the old K1000 being one of my favorite standard SLRs, along with the newer ZX50.  If you're not use to using a typical SLR and have been using any of the simple point-and-shoot digital cameras out there, don't worry, trust yourself, you can adapt and it can be really exhilarating.  Using an SLR, whether 35mm or digital, offers so much more when taking pictures.You may be one of those who are debating with yourself: Pentax, Canon or Nikon?  Then you find yourself reading too many publication reviews (and more, like posts here on Amazon) and you lean one way, then the next, and finally start getting crazy.  Pure & simple, all three manufacturers make excellent cameras: including digital SLRs!  I think anyone who is involved with photography will agree.  However, I've used Canon's & Nikons, and Pentax has always ended up being my #1 choice.When looking for a camera, I feel your #1 consideration should be: how much photography do you do?  If you're like me; a traveler, a hobbyist, and find yourself shooting a lot of photos then you're more apt to invest in a good camera.  The #2 consideration is cost.  Without a doubt, the Pentax K100D Super results in one of the best Digital SLRs out there for the money; a fact all publication reviews, that I respect, agree on.Many publication reviews often compare the K100D Super to the Nikon & Cannon, and one of the most consistent factors noted is while Canon & Nikon digitals are sporting 10 megapixels, the K100D Super only has 6.5 megapixel.  I say, what ever.  The reality is, that 10 megapixels can be a concern if you're trying to print pictures the size of posters, and quite simply most people aren't.  The reality is most folks will print normal size photos, and even up to 8.5x11 or slightly larger.  The Pentax shoots in RAW & JPEG, the RAW features allows for manipulation, using any descent photo software, to larger sizes photos including 15x17.5I've used my K100D Super on a recent trip to Point Reyes State Park, here in the Bay Area.  I was sure to shoot photos of sand on the beach: personal and really up close to see individual grains of sand.  I took photos of the oysters we had, reflections of drift wood on still salt water ponds, a jelly fish (some 30 feet away), the crashing waves, any possible deviation of shots I could think of, and I was purely amazed at the K100D Super's performance & quality!  I used both the Auto setting and then played with the other settings.While there are many great features on the Pentax, and easy read up is available on-line, let me highlight those I would note to support my recommendation:Cost:  This camera is the best value & cost for a camera of this quality.  Again, this is stated time and time again in publication & on-line reviews.Body:  The body of the K100D Super is solid! It's a great combination of polycarbonate & stainless steel housing.  It's not the cheapo plastic like other cameras.Anti-shake:  This alone, is one serious note to consider.  Pentax puts their anti-shake in the camera body, unlike Nikon & Canon who put it in their lenses, thus one reason why Canon & Nikon lens cost more in the long run.  Now, seeing the error in their ways, I've read Nikon & Canon are racing like mad dogs to fall in line with Pentax's lead.Pentax Lenses:  Any Pentax lens ever made will work on the K100D Super.  This is where Pentax has shined for years.  Those of us with older lenses can just pop them right onto the K100D Super's body (in fact, most Pentax SLR cameras allow for this).  If you go to a garage sale or flea market and find a great old Pentax lens, it's will fit the K100D Super.  And since this is the case, all Pentax lenses benefit from the anti-shake in the camera.  Better yet, digital lenses are different than film lenses.  Film lenses are superior in many ways to digital lenses.  Using an older Pentax film lens on the digital body enhances the quality of the photo, an added benefit to the Pentax crowd.And, the K100D Super is already set to accept the newest generation of Pentax lenses (SDM lenses) coming out this year.Dust Removal System:  The Pentax has an internal anti-dust shake device that removes any dust that may be present.Auto/Manual: Auto Picture Mode, Scene Modes & Manual.  You can easily go between using the Auto mode of the camera or fall back on your own experience of doing things manually using the AV, TV, Manual and so on.Memory Card:  the K100D Super uses SD Cards, but typical Pentax (thinking ahead), the camera will also accept the newer SDHC cards.Batteries:  There are several batteries the camera can utilize:  rechargeable, Lithium & standard AA+.  This is a benefit as you're not limited to one manufacturer's battery.I took this camera out of the box, DID NOT READ ANYTHING - LITERALLY, put in the batteries, put in an SD Card, turned it on, set the date, turned it off and walked out the door to Point Reyes.  Then, I turned it on and starting shooting pictures.  It was that easy (and yes, I plan to read the manual).  I wish Amazon let you post photos on a review.This is a solid pick for me and others.

I bought the K100D Super, and it is truly .... \"Super\"!!!Not only does it accept all my old K series lenses from my old film camera (saving me thousands of dollars), but it's easy to use.  No sooner do you pull this out of the box do you immediately begin to realize how it works.  The settings are intutitive, and photos are professional-grade.I was considering it's older brother, the K10, but I feel I've made the right choice.

Maynard \"Top 5 Records\"", "ReviewID": "R2FI7F5QK0FNIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first foray into the digital SLR world. I have always had Pentax film cameras (K1000, and ME Super) and have loved their quality. I've read that the new DSLR's use the same lens mount as the 35mm camera body so it made the most sense to stick with Pentax. In retrospect, old lenses don't play well with the new auto settings of the digital camera, and new lenses are designed to work specifically with your digital camera body. If you have an assortment of Pentax compatible lenses it may still make sense to stick with the same brand in the digital world. However, in retrospect I wouldn't have given this single factor so much weight in my decision, since I won't likely use any of them unless I intend to do a lot of the manual camera work in my head. I should say that the Anti-shake feature is \"in\" the camera body for Pentax, as opposed to the lens for Nikon. I really like this feature and has proven to help take sharp photos in low light lighting and is a plus if you do intend to use your old lenses. Overall I am very happy with this camera, I am a casual photographer and the 6MP is more than I need for the type of shooting I like to do.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Stop searching and just buy this one - you won't regret it!", "Author": "EagleCroft \"EagleCroft\"", "ReviewID": "R9OHE51DQUNQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched for 3 months reading review after review, I found myself up too late in the evenings scouring the web looking for the perfect combination of features and cost (overall value). I have owned point and shoot digicams for years, in fact own a nice Canon SD800 now and am thrilled with it - the last SLR I owned was a fully manual Minolta 35mm made in 1962!For me it came down first deciding upon one of the new SuperZoom (15x or higher) digicams (Panasonic FZ18, or Canon S5 IS), or going for a full DSLR (Nikon D40 or Pentax K100D Super). I eliminated the SuperZooms eventually because I didn't feel they were different enough from my Canon P&S; to justify the purchase. This was a tough call because the SuperZooms were at least $200 less than the cheapest SLR. My gripes with the SuperZoom's I played with were that they felt like toys, very lightweight, and were small in my hands to hold. The other concern I had with the SuperZooms was that at their maximum zoom they weren't very 'fast' - meaning that unless you were taking pictures outdoors with a lot of light the pictures would come out dark or not at all. I needed a camera that had a great zoom but could be used indoors during sporting events. The Panasonic FZ18 does seem to be the king of the hill in the SuperZoom segment, but I decided to just bite the bullet spend the extra dough and go for a DSLR.I played with both the Nikon D40 and the Pentax K100D in a local mall Photo Store (big chain), and they were both nice to use. The Nikon had an edge over the Pentax in terms of focusing time (just barely), and it could fire off continuous shots better than the Pentax. But everywhere else I thought the Pentax was better. What clinched the deal was the rebate offered through Pentax which will save me hundreds over the Nikon. I ended up ordering the Pentax online because the Mall Photo store wouldn't price match. Oh well, their loss - I would have bought it from them if they just would have matched.Right out of the box I started taking pictures, I glanced at the instructions but mostly I just started taking photos. I popped in the 4 AA's that came with it, a recently purchased class 6 4gb SDHC flash card and away I went taking great pictures. I've since poured through the manual and absorbed much of it (but it'll need several more reviews for it all to sink in). I also purchased a 70-300mm Sigma Zoom lens which matched to it nicely.I put the package to the test this weekend at a swim meet (indoors), previously with my P&S; I could never zoom in close enough and it was always too dark to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Well with the Pentax I was able to boost the ISO all the way up to 3200 which resulted in a fast shutter speed and even at this high of an ISO the pictures didn't look grainy at all. In fact they looked fantastic! I was shocked at how well the camera performed, I had a blast taking picture after picture - without any shutter lag and with each picture looking great! My only disappointment is that I didn't buy this camera sooner.If you are on the fence like I was, take my advice and just buy this camera. If you have kids like I do the pictures you'll take will be priceless and will far outweigh the investment you'll make in this camera.Congratulations to Pentax for building such an amazing camera, one that is solidly constructed and enables amateur photographers like me to produce pictures that look great!", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "best for its class considering the price", "Author": "Adri Febrianto", "ReviewID": "RSIPPYU91OKJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently made my jump to the DSLR camera after around five years being a pocket digicam user. My first digital camera was a very compact one megapixel, and then I changed it to the more megapixel count digicam which was Fuji 3.2 megs. Getting interested in using manual exposure made me ditch that and bought the Pentax Optio 550. It's my last pocket digicam before I bought this K100D Super.What I can share about this great DSLR is this K100D Super is loaded with lots of features, such as Shake Reduction (a very useful features that allows me to take pictures  indoor without having to fire the flash so I could take advantage of those sun rays sneaking thru' the branches of tree outside my room's window), 11 autofocus point, AA battery (ever run out of juice when you're in the middle of your fun day ?), a display on top of the cam, digital filter and dust removal capability. You can have all of these features at a price that won't break your piggy bank.In Indonesia where I live, a shop offered me a very good deal where this DSLR can be had for as low as around USD 540.The picture quality is top-notch, very crisp and clear. I cranked the sharpness setting one step higher, and the sharpness of pictures I've taken never let me down, even in high ISO and low speed.Combination of those three factors (features, price and pic-quality) made this cam the most suitable DSLR for amateur like me.If you're looking for a DSLR that could bolster your career as a fine photographer, this cam might  not be right choice, as more advanced DSLR like K10D (also from Pentax), Nikon D200, or Canon 40D carry more features, perform better and provide better picture quality, but come with higher price tags.This K100D is not without its downside. For action and/or sport photographer, this cam perform too slow when you use the continous mode. Very large print is somewhat not recommended as this cam only provides 6 megs.Ask yourself what is your need in using the DSLR for you. After you already have the clear answer to the question, then you can match your need to the feature of the cameras.Sorry if my English is bad, as it's not my native lang.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the Beginner", "Author": "V.

To this end, even this, their lowest-end camera, is PACKED with premium features.  Let's take a look at them:1.  Dust Reduction:  Dust WILL get into your camera!  This keeps it off of the sensor and increases the time inbetween cleanings.2.  Shake Reduction:  It's good for a couple of stops of shooting leeway and you get it with every lens you use.  Other companies build their systems into the lenses, meaning ONE lens can cost as much or more than the camera, itself!  Lens-based anti-shake systems are more effective at long zoom than body-based systems, but unless you're rich, you won't be able to afford a suite of good lenses!  With this camera, you can use ANY Pentax lens and get anti-shake.3.  AA batteries:  Proprietary battery packs are NO GOOD.  Hmmm, if you're on a shoot and your pack dies, you're not taking ANY photos unless you get a spare, right?  With this camera, pick up some 2500mAh Ni-MH AA's and you can afford to get three sets.  However, the power drain is so small, you might not need more than one set.4.  6 MP sensor:  Don't EVER get trapped in the megapixel hype.  Megapixels mean nothing in the DSLR game, except for noise issues.  Let me explain.  The sensor sizes on almost all DSLRs (except for $5000 full-frame pro cameras) are APS-sized, meaning the sensor size on this camera and the Nikon D300 are very nearly the same dimensions.  This means that photosensors on the chip have to be made smaller to get more pixels...meaning that the closer together/smaller sites are LESS light sensitive and they will also interfere with each other.  6 MP is a perfect sweet spot for noise and image sharpness. You get a base ISO of 200, meaning your camera is TWICE as sensitive to light as one with a base ISO of 100!  This camera records color accurately and makes prints up to 8.5\"x11\" with no problem.This camera has huge features and, even with the release of the K20D and K200D cameras, still maintains a good feature/image quality set with a proven CCD sensor and a suite of easy-to-learn features and settings.  I LOVE this camera and even though I have a K200D for the weather sealing and larger burst capacity, the K100D super is the camera I ALWAYS take with me in trips.  You're better off getting this camera plus a really nice lens and a 360FZ flash than a more expensive camera with a base kit lens and no external flash.Believe me, this camera's quality will not fail to impress you and it will grow with you.  It can use ANY lens its bigger brothers can and it uses them effortlessly.A superb camera and one for the record books!", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent starter DSLR", "Author": "P.

I was looking for a DSLR that would help me with that next step and would accommodate my needs as my skills improve. I considered the entry level DSLRs from Canon, Nikon, and Pentax. You'll find a lot of websites that give you great reviews of all of them.I decided to go with the Pentax K100D Super. I didn't like how the Canon's felt and thought the Nikon D40x was just too expensive and didn't have the shake reduction feature in body. I also have a lot of rechargeable AA batteries that I am able to use with the K100D Super.I've owned it for almost two months now. I am not disappointed.  The shift from point and shoots to DSLRs is a big one. You'll have to learn the basics of exposure no matter what camera you decide to purchase. My biggest challenge with the K100D Super was setting the white balance. The Auto White Balance feature doesn't work as well as my point and shoot. I find that you have to set it manually and can't rely on the automatic setting. It's something I never had to fiddle with before, but I found a lot of help on pentaxforums.PROS:-Price-Features  shake reduction  lots of automatic settings for amateurs  lens system (you can pretty much use any lens thats made for a pentax  slr)-build quality and ergonomics-uses AA size batteries.CONS:- auto white balance doesn't work wellI'm amazed at the quality of the images from the camera.

I chose it because the K body will accept the lenses from my old camera, which it does quite well.The camera is nicely ergonomic and fits well in the hand. All the controls are easy to get to with the possible exception of the focus mode switch which is hidden on the front.Pictures are excellent under almost all conditions.I do have some reservations though.The flash, while convenient, is underpowered for anything but very close up pictures.The user menus are baffling at best. All of the actual controls are obvious and easy to get to and use, but once you start pulling up menus there is absolutely no aspect of them that is obvious or intuitive. Be sure to bring the manual with you for the first few uses.If the camera is in standby it will take a moment to wake up, making shooting on the fly a hit or miss adventure. This is aggravated if you are using a variable aperture lens in anti shake mode, as it will ask you what setting to use. This will stall the wake up function and prevent picture playback, but will not prevent picture taking.In certain modes the camera will prevent you from taking a picture or will delay shutter release until it is ready to do so, and it does give indications when it does so, but they are not obvious. This is a training problem of course, but the byzantine menu system makes a steep learning curve on this camera.Battery life is great. It uses AA batteries and a set should be adequate for well over a days shooting.

My daughter does gymnastics and the pictures I take are taken indoors without flash.  In order to get the most benefit from this camera, DO NOT settle for the kit lens that comes with it.  That lens (18-55mm) is fine for outdoor snapshots, but to really get the most of this camera, get a fast prime lens (50mm f1.4, 50mm f1.7, 50mm f2.0, 35mm f2.0, 28mm f1.8, 20mm f1.8, etc.)  This camera can take pictures that I believe NO OTHER SLR can do and has 3 distinct advantages over other SLRs.1. Shake reduction - This allows the camera to be reduce movement due to the user and keeps the photos sharper.  It can be used with ANY Pentax-mount lens you put on, saving potentially huge amounts on lenses (check out others stabilized lens prices and you'll see).  Some of the other Pentax bodies also have this feature and I understand that there may even be a higher degree of reduction with models like the 10D.2. More sensitivity - You may think a 6 megapixel image is a disadvantage, but it allows the sensor to have an ISO range of 200 MINIMUM to 3200, because the sensors are larger and need less light, meaning more speed.  No other currently made body that I know of has this kind of sensor sensitivity, although some bump the ISO up as high or higher with expensive, perhaps more advanced (but I don't think better results) technology.3. More lens usage - there are more lenses available that fit on this camera than on any other brand, by far, and these lenses are often far less cost than what the new types cost.  I've found that manual focus lenses are not always a disadvantage, and in fact, often get me better and faster pictures, since I can set the focus and not have to wait for the camera to do the focus function.  Other Pentax bodies do the same.So, if you want a camera for indoor shooting with the most sensitivity and not spend an arm and a leg, get this one and get a prime lens or two to go with it.

The K100D Super is the digital evolution of those great Pentax film cameras which I'm sure many of us  have been missing.  While billed as an entry level DSLR, it posesses all the manual features any experienced film shooter would be familiar with and will instantly comprehend.  In addition, it can be used in complete auto or scene modes for point and shoot users who are graduating to the SLR experience.This is really a serious piece of gear at a great price. It is built very solidly with a metal frame and proper access doors instead of those cheap rubber flaps other manufacturers are using. It feels natural in my average size male hands and all the controls are where they should be.  Menus are easy to navigate and it takes minimum time to orient around the displays to make a variety of custom settings. Kudos to the engineers who made things so ergonomic and user friendly for both novice and veteran photographers. The pentamirror viewfinder is bright, uncluttered and all 35mm users should be right at home with the quality of the display.

Unless you plan on making poster size prints, this is really a non-issue. Don't fall for all the pixel packing marketing hype. Pentax is to be congratulated for using a proven, excellent quality APS-C sensor which undoubtedly factors into keeping the price down (and the ISO noise down too!).  The photo processor is also proven over a couple of previous models and is top notch. The utility of using commercial AA batteries is underrated.

The only con is the cost of CV3 batteries if you want a long performance battery, however it is great that works also with AA batteries.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Bang-for-Buck Camera", "Author": "Stormie", "ReviewID": "RAQNH3MC489VE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally purchased this camera as lighter weight \"carry-it-everywhere\" kit, and I could NOT be happier with the camera.  The functionality of this is almost as good as the 3x more expensive K10, with enough user settings to keep you busy getting accustomed to them.  The manual is easy to read, and there are many cool things you can tweek.  Lightweight, easy to hold, and it will accept ANY Pentax lens ever made if you don't mind manual focusing on some.SUMMARY:  If you are a pro, and NEED to sell 36\"x60\" enlargements of your Grand Canyon panoramic shots, then you aren't considering this camera anyway.  If you are not that kind of pro, you can't go wrong with this kit.  When you get the money together, get Pentax's excellent 55-300 zoom to compliment your kit.

Anyway, detractors aside, this is an awesome camera, every bit as good as advertised.  The pictures are simply amazing!  Pictures are very sharp, with excellent color and contrast.  The kit lens is more than decent.  The other \"amazing\" thing is that I had an old Vivitar with two lenses that actually fit this camera and they work perfectly!

Not to brag, but a local Camera shop had the kit, with the lens and K100D body not the K110D body for 399.99 regular price, minus the 100 rebate the pentax offers on their website (store had no idea) that 300 bucks for this beauty. Now I'm not going to say where I bought just know that their recommend by Pentax's official website.So my review. It takes a little getting use to but this thing is amazing. I'm personal a no flash kinda guy and this thing really does an amazing job. It does fantastic at on night shots, and that what I live for with my camera. Capturing what I can't see (this guy also does great at capturing exactly what you seeing, its amazing\" I do a white light adjustment and then figure out my exposure (I never trust the automatic and haven't tested it trial and error is the best way to go) and I'm getting unreal shot. My first run at night shots with this thing got me the shots I'll be sending out as christmas gifts this year.My own mother found it hard to believe I took that shot, and thanx to walmart I've already gotten some excellent 8x10's and haven't even owned it for 48 hours yet. So GET THIS Baby, wether you buy it here (don't buy from walmart horrible shipping department) or Penn Camera, your shure to love your results once you get the basic down. Did I mention the top LCD that tells you your Exposure Appature battery meeter and two other things that I haven't figure out yet, and its got an excellent macro function, ok what are you waiting for buy this thing, and start shooting awesome pictures at a price no one is going to believe, (does better then my fathers Nikon D40 and my sisters Nikon D80 neither one believes what I paid and the quality) Also unlike nikon and cannon this supports all their previous lenes so lenes are easy to find and can be found at a steal. Not to mention this thing is made of Carbon something or other, its very solid....Also it has a built in CCD Cleaner, you just press a button and it makes some noice and shakes off the dust. EXCELLENT BUY a must have. If your looking at this, you should already be buying this.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "DO NOT MISS BUYING THIS CAMERA !!!!!", "Author": "perennialgardener", "ReviewID": "R2SIZZM7KABH4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "'DO NOT MISS THIS CAMERA!!!Several weeks ago, I purchased the Pentax K100D Super here on Amazon, after doing lots of research here and on other sites. I have been a somewhat serious amateur for 20 years or more, my last SLR being a Pentax Super Program. I also have been using an Olympus point & shoot digital camera, only 1.3 megapixels. It was time to upgrade!There were several reasons I went with the K100D Super.1. It is one of the few SLR digitals that uses AA rechargeable batteries. BTW, I use only the new Nimh that hold their charge seemingly forever. They work great.2. It was compatible with the whole bag of Pentax lenses I bought 20 years ago! This saved me hundreds of dollars!3. It has been out of production for 2 years, so this was maybe the last chance! Ebay only had 2, both used models.4. It has a dust removal system, which several techie friends said I wanted.5. It has the shake reduction system in the camera, instead of the lenses, like some other top brands. This is what allows you to have shake reduction with your old lenses.So how do I like it, after several days of intense shooting in different conditions? Here is a list of things I like, in no particular order.1. It uses all my old lenses, although the auto focus does not function with them. It does, however, not allow you to shoot unless the lens is totally focused.2. One quick trip through the manual and I was able to find all the options on my own. There is a nice bright, large LCD screen on the back that shows all the info. When you review pictures you havetaken, you can see them full screen, or up in the corner, with the rest of the screen filled with all the settings that were in effect for the photo. There a several options for info display as well.3. After talking to people who are using cameras that cost $2,000, I found that the top ISO setting is larger than theirs. It goes to 3200. If you do any inside shooting without flash, make sure the camera is set to be able to reach all the way to 3200.4. Top shutter speed is 1/4000th of a second.5. An  available option is a great lens, 18-55 zoom. Don't miss this one!6. I am using a 4gig SD card. At the lowest settings of pixels and quality, you can get almost 9,000 pictures on the card! At middle quality, you still get a couple thousand on a 4gig card.7. If you have been using a point & shoot digital and are switching to SLR, you won't believe how fast you can shoot pictures. Pretty much as fast as you press the button.8. I love the USB cord for transferring pictures to my computer. Using Windows XP, I didn't do anything but plug in. The computer set  itself up for my camera and I just used a photo viewer I always use to move photos around, to transfer them into the computer.9. One set of alkaline batteries that came with the camera wore out while I was just learning the camera. The rechargeable Nimh hybrids lasted all day, in fact I probably shot 400 or 500 photos, left it on much of the day, and the gauge still showed a full charge. 2 sets of these batteries are about all you would ever need.10. I tried shooting outside in the dark with just lights in the neighborhood and the results were great, using the night shot setting.11. This camera was envied all weekend by people who had higher priced digital SLRs. Takes great photos, gives you whatever amount of help you need, and lets you control whatever you want to. Even if you have never used an SLR of any type, don't miss this camera.Possible cons -1. The lens that comes with the camera on amazon has 5.6 or 4 as its widest aperture. That is one reason you have to use 3200 ISO inside without flash. I have a 55mm 1.4 lens that works great.2. Make sure you start by setting the Sharpness option as high as it goes. The default isn't the best.3. The metal loops that hold the straps are mounted vertically, when they should be horizontal. The way they are, when you wear it around your neck, the camera lens tends to point out, not down, even with a heavy telephoto lens attached. This makes it more likely to get damage on the lens or just bang it into people in a crowd. DO NOT NEGLECT TO BUY A SKYLIGHT 1B FILTER TO PROTECT THE LENS.4. With a telephoto lens, this camera is heavy. But that does help to lessen shaking.5. The auto white balance is still not too realistic inside with some types of light. When I set the balance manually, it was beautiful, the colors almost exactly what I saw with my eyes.Hints -1. Make sure to buy the big Canon camera bag, if you have 3 or more lenses and other gadgets like chargers. Otherwise you will have to go to camera stores and pay top dollar. Walmart, Target, evenbig box electronics stores tend not to have nice big camera bags. I would also recommend buying a small bag that only holds the camera and a small lens, for when you want to just grab it and go. The big Canon bag is HEAVY when loaded, and you have to keep something that big with you at all times because people know what is in it!

Unlike Canon & Nikon DSLR cameras, which you are forced to accept their rechargeable batteries at their higher prices, and when your Canon or Nikon rechargeables run out, you can't run out to the corner store to replace them.

Dykstra", "ReviewID": "R262SI3V9I8U3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I grew up on old film SLRs with manual lenses. So when I finally had the opportunity to get a digital SLR, I was looking for something with a little flexibility. After looking at a number of cameras on-line, I settled on this one for a number of reasons. First of all, it takes 4 AA batteries which gives a number of options. While the battery life of NiMH rechargeable batteries can be short if the batteries are not new, this is a cheap option. With a good set of rechargeable batteries freshly charged, I can get a lot of shots. If you want longer life, you can use lithium batteries. Second, this camera takes the famous Pentax K mount lenses which means that you have access not only to the newest autofocus lenses designed for digital cameras, but also many decades worth of high quality manual lenses that were designed for a number of cameras with the Pentax K mount and which are available at great prices used. Using an older manual lens requires some setup in the menus and some practice getting the exposure right, but the results can be outstanding. These two things were the biggest selling point for me. Additionally, the camera takes SD cards which are now more or less the norm and can be bought cheaply and a number of other peripherals are available such as flashes, cable releases and AC adapters.There are a few small drawbacks to the camera. Many reviewers have already mentioned the fact that the camera has a relatively low resolution compared to some of the latest digital SLRs and that many of the features are menu-driven. Additionally, I have found two other issues that are somewhat inconvenient. First of all, there is no PC plug-in for a slave flash, so if you want to use an off-camera flash, you have to get an adapter. Second, the focusing screen that comes with the camera does not have the old-fashioned split-screen in the center so it is very difficult to focus with manual lenses, especially in the telephoto range. I solved that issue by getting an after market split-screen focusing screen from Katzeye. All of these issues are minor and can be gotten around.There are a few things you should be aware of if you get this camera. First of all, there is a limit to how much voltage the hot shoe can take so if you get an accessory flash, make sure you either get the Pentax-approved flashes or do some research on the voltage of the flash you hope to use. Second, some Ricoh autofocus lenses have a propitiatory autofocus connection that has to be removed or it will cause the lens to be stuck to the camera. Third, like all digital SLRs, the sensor can become dusty or dirty. It can be cleaned, but you have to follow approved procedures or you can risk damage to the filter over the sensor.If you are looking for an excellent digital SLR that offers a ton of flexibility, definitely check this one out. Pentax has long been known for quality photographic equipment and this camera is no exception. If you require a camera with higher resolution, check out some of Pentax's newer models which offer the same flexibility. The kit lens that comes with the camera does a very nice job for most standard photos, but again, the great selling point of this camera is the mountain of accessories that can be used with it.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is a GLC!", "Author": "Nicholas S.
