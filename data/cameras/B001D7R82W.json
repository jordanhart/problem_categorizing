Unfortunately, I ended up returning this product through my own fault - I did not realize that the camera required easy access to an outdoor outlet and the wire with each camera is only 6 feet in length.  I did get in touch with the vendor's customer service department, who responded immediately.  One option would have been to mount the camera to the inside of a window frame if the window had clear glass.  In my case, the clearance was too narrow to allow this.  I can tell you that the equipment appeared to be extremely well made and the customer service department is extremely responsive.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "stirling conrad", "ReviewID": "RYGTVTQ9YLAAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this system in my check cashing store. It allows me to see and hear whats going on at the front counter from my back office or from next door.The roaming capabilities are good. I can walk to the end of my plaza and still have a good video image. It also allows for a 2nd camera.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pleased", "Author": "Cynthia Early \"View needed\"", "ReviewID": "R1EIFS40ZLMCFJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We use the product with 2 cameras.  We needed something that would allow us to have some visibility of the front door and driveway when we were in a location of the house without front windows.  This product allows us to quickly and easily view without going to the front of the house.  If exterior lights are on the night view is pretty good, otherwise it is about 8 to 10 feet from the camera with the night vision.  We have the monitor set up to the TV to enlarge the view.  Based on weather and other external factors the picture may be fuzzy at times...but definately clear enough for what view is needed. We are very pleased with the purchase and would recomend.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "COULD BE BETTER.", "Author": "security", "ReviewID": "R1KYO27VPZMXV4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered the viewer with two cameras. They liik great comin out of the box but the wiring is strange for an outdoor camera. Yes it is wireless but the camera must be plugged into a power source. The camera is connected to the power cord by a small plug attachment. The connection is open to the elements.The picture clarity is not bad during the day but does not work at night. Unless you have a spotlight on the area you want to view there will be no image.After a few weeks the screws on the camera started to rust. Not a good sign for an outdoor camera.We'll see how the camera stands up to theelements in the following weeks.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Misleading", "Author": "S. PATTILLO", "ReviewID": "R3DXZ1S4BDV30I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera does not have a Video component cable.  You can not hook this up to a standard DVR.  It's an accessory for a small LCD monitor by the same company.  Therefore its useless to me.  The only cable coming out of the camera is a power cable.  Also do not unscrew the bottom jpart cause it wont screw back on correctly because of the cables stuffed in it.  The info on this Camera was misleading.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for use as a baby monitor", "Author": "Shaun Andrews \"web designer\"", "ReviewID": "R1A1VUEAPEZBW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own two of these cameras and I use them as baby monitors for my twins. They're great, and the night vision is a great plus! Works from across the house and even out to the patio with minimal interference.

We have a three story home and the monitor works with minor interference from the first to the third floor.I like the alert feature.  it allows you to set the sensitivity of the mic and, when it hears a noise louder than what you specified, it will beep three times.  This allows me to monitor my son without actually having to listen.  I can mute the speaker and it will beep when it hears him crying.Build quality is decent.  It's what you'd expect from a camera in this price range.  Good value for the money.NOTE: I knew this beforehand but, for those of you that think \"wireless\" means no wires you'll be disappointed.  You still need to plug in an AC adapter to power the camera.  There ARE battery packs out there for those of you that really need a wireless set up though.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "ehh .. spend some more money on something better", "Author": "David Schupner", "ReviewID": "R192RJO1V4D4J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It just ok.
