There are a plethora of settings that are fun to play around with, and the pictures generally come out with great quality. The price is certainly good for what you get.The camera is small enough to tote around and easy enough to use for those spontaneous, spur of the moment photographs!", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "What I was looking for", "Author": "Ann", "ReviewID": "RWR2AXT7KWEE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first digital camera.  Has way too many features for me, and I think a complicated menu if you get into all the functions.  But I'm a first digital camera user.  The quality of picture, I was amazed, and the zoom is great.  I've had it 1 month and still playing with it, but all my pictures are very good quality and the color is right on, and that's just on automatic.  Many things you can do with this camera, price is unbeatable!  Didn't give the full 5 stars because the menu goes on and on for functions I'll never use.  I was surprised you can do video with it too, it even has a mike!  Hollywood, here I come!!  Bought a case (red to match) separately from Amazon too, good  fit.

I also admire their cameras to get great pictures.  The later Stylus film cameras were just as good with more features packed into small packages, and best of all, they were never expensive to own.  C-50 took great pictures too.  My last camera was a SP-320 7-megapixel with enter level video, and the pictures were clear and sharp in all conditions.  So I was glad that Olympus had been holding up its tradition.  That is until I bought this FE-47 pocket 14MP point and shoot.  What a lousy camera!The pictures are bad and grainy even on bright day light.  Indoor on a day time is bad enough.  When you choose the shake compensation mode, then you cannot choose other shooting mode at the same time, rendering all others unless.  The pictures look like a 1MP cheap cameras of the late '90s.  The only decent pictures are portraits taken 5 feet away.  Anything farther than 10 feet, good luck.People complain of its battery life of only about 20 shots, but I think you have to choose Ni-MH on the Setup last entry to tell the camera to expect 1.25 volts instead of 1.5 volts of alkaline voltage, so that the camera won't tell you the battery is empty.  By all means using rechargeable Ni-MH or Lithium-Ion AA, and forget about alkaline battery.I do not like the camera has no one button movie mode because you have to scroll through the top menu to find the movie camera, and it is too slow to take fast movie clips.I am going to sell this FE-47 for a loss and move on.  Its bright red color body still would attract users who want brilliant colors on the camera rather than the accurate and sharp colors on the pictures.Stay away from FE-47.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "baby", "ReviewID": "R1ZEF32MOW87U5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far this camera is a great little camera.I do enjoy it.I would definitly buy another one.S", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "cburger", "ReviewID": "R3GI37YJPA1OX2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't had this product to long or used it to often.

One thing I didn't realize is that it uses AA batteries and they don't last long.  A nice thing about the batteries though, is you can go anywhere and buy them and they will be charged.  You can also keep extra ones with you in your camera bag.  That is what I do; I also use rechargeable ones.  I don't like the software it comes with, it isn't user friendly and I haven't tried any other one yet to see if it is compatible.  Overall I am happy you just have to be prepared with extra batteries and you'll be fine.

It was easy to set up. The only drawback I found was the position of the battery cover. It is opposite the buttons for shooting. On occasion when I was shooting, my thumb would compress the battery cover button and accidently popped out the batteries. Now that I am aware of it, I have learned to keep my thumb away, but I have to explain to everyone that uses it. The camera is a little weightier that my previous cameras. However, I like the software program that allows quick downloads and tagging of picures. The tags can be face recognition, GPS position, titles, and events. I would recommend this camera to others. It  is easy for non-techies.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "VERY HAPPY", "Author": "D.
