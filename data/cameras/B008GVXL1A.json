The little latch in the back to open the camera and insert the zink paper is really flimsy. I accidentally bumped it once and all the papers fell out. The power button on top can easily be accidentally toggled as well. I've resorted to keeping a rubberband around the body to keep it from opening. It is only a little bit inconvenient that in order to review your pictures you have to move over the little slider to the playback option, much like older cameras, rather than a playback button - but that's just a minor complaint.Other than that, for $160, you get a fully functioning 10 mp camera. The pictures look much better on the computer than what you see on the LCD screen. The prints are pretty good, though definitely not film quality. This camera is to be used more for fun and you should not expect anything close to professional quality. You do get a few cool options, like color selection when taking photos, and a few frames when you print the pictures. It also takes 720p video which is always nice.Definitely a fun camera and if you buy the paper online, prints are pretty cheap.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for scrap-booking", "Author": "Jenjen \"Jenjen\"", "ReviewID": "R1UP3AET5KHBE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you like using your phone to take instagrams your going love this camera!

Flores", "ReviewID": "R4GLHHDF3WVTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was an early Christmas gift last year and I find it perfect for what I need. I wanted a camera that took digital pictures, had expandable memory, was easy to use, and printed out pictures directly from the unit. The Polaroid Z340 Polaroid Z340 3x4 Instant Digital Camera with ZINK (Zero Ink) Printing Technology was too much money and bigger in size than I wanted and the Polaroid 300 Polaroid PIC-300P Instant Film Analog Camera (Purple) didn't have the memory ability I was looking for.After some research of this and the Fuji Instax instant camera line, I settled on this one because of a couple of things.PROS:1) The Polaroid Z2300 has the throwback design that ultimately made it more portable than the Fuji Instax cameras. Yes, it is bigger than many purely digital cameras but you have to take into consideration that it has the printer inside. I have no issue with their being actual buttons, at times it is easier for me than having a touchscreen.2)User friendly memory. I got a 16gb sd card as a promotion and it serves me to be able to selectively print pictures than to just have them print immediately after taking them. I am not the world's best photographer and I wasted many an instant camera in high school due to my lack of skills. Nothing sucked more than finally getting everyone together in the perfect pose at the dance than to press the shutter and find my last picture was already taken :( I have been able to successfully transfer photos from my computer to the sd card to print from Facebook and other cameras, and have also used my phone's micro sd with an adapter to make prints directly using this camera.Some photos do not show up because they are too high resolution (12MP is where I maxed out.) The Polaroid Z2300 only likes landscape, otherwise you get an error message and cannot print. I set my Polaroid Z2300 at 8MP and the pictures come out nice, very little gets cropped in the printing process. My new phone (HTC ONE 32GB)takes true landscape pics and I found that it will fit the entire picture in the print, but the pictures come out \"letter boxed\" at the top and bottom with white bars (see customer pics for mine.)The ability to take video was another selling point as I do not always have enough battery or memory available on my phone to take HD videos. The format is .avi and to my amateur pov looks good, definitely HD quality. Be warned that the video takes up A LOT of memory and the camera only takes up to 32GB SD cards.3) INSTANT MEMORIES! I love that I can just print out a picture and touch it, use it,  rub it and none of those things will mess it up after it's done. The fact that it is also a sticker makes making albums and Smashbooks easier. I have given them out as gifts to friends, use it to make going away presents for coworkers and it has been handy to use as \"wallets\" like back in the day. My little cousins personalized backpacks and for an avid Disneyland visitor like me, having prints of those memories is priceless.CONS:1) Picture quality is not always the best, you have to learn what setting works for what scene. This may be a hassle for some people but since I choose what pictures to print and save, not so much of a dealbreaker, just wanted to point it out to others. Colors are either brilliant and spot on, or slightly orangey. They look better on the computer than the camera's LCD screen. Printouts also can come out washed out but it depends on the picture taken in my pov.2) Battery life not so good when printing multiples. It tends to run out faster when I am just in a printing  session and unfortunately taking out the camera battery deletes the date/time setting, which you have to set before being able to take pictures. The battery is removable though but it does charge through ac adapter only. I have yet tried to charge it through usb. Mine came with all these plug adapters for different countries, which may be useful for those that travel, but I just stored them in the junk drawer. I do plan on getting a new battery for just in case.3)You will not find ZINK Premium photo papers Polaroid 2x3\" Premium ZINK Photo paper - 50-Pack in stores. I have been able to order some off Amazon but if I run out, I cannot just go to the store and get more. Keep that in mind if you are wanting this camera for crafting purposes or events. The paper itself is cheap and I haven't wasted more than a handful in the past year. I believe around $0.50 a print.If you want a fun camera that helps you shares memories in a unique way, I recommend this camera. This is a gadget in all the sense of the word, not something professional photographers or nitpickers should get, because you will be disappointed. Figure out if your needs are what this camera can give you, because I am thoroughly happy with mine and will be giving one to my cousin now that the price has gone down.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little camera", "Author": "Andrea de la Pena", "ReviewID": "R7HM3NKOZHYHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use for my wedding.

Gerber", "ReviewID": "R3U1RJ3IHUWQWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera as a simple one for my wife to use. Unfortunately, the camera lacks some key capabilities for a camera in it's price range:No auto focus - the 3 zone focus switch found on less expensive Polaroid instant cameras should have been replaced by full auto focus. My wife inevitable gets frustrated trying to set the focus correctly.Poorly conceived switching between shooting and image viewing mode - when even $60 digital cameras have a little button to go into image viewing mode and return to shooting mode when you depress the shutter button, Polaroid chose to use a switch like the one for focus selection. My wife constantly complains about missing shots because she forgot to switch the camera back to shooting mode.The camera is bigger than I expected. The photos of the camera and the small size of the printer paper make it look like it's smart phone thin. It's not. It's over 4 1/2 inches long, 3 inches wide and nearly 1 1/2 inches thick. It's also pretty heavy at 11 ounces with battery and printing paper.The battery doesn't last all that long, especially if you print out your pictures, and I don't see why anyone would buy this camera, if they didn't expect to print pictures directly from the camera. The battery had to be recharged before we took and printed a 10 sheet pack of paper.The printed pictures are quite small and the quality is not that good. Pictures with flash are especially poor.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Image Quality and Clunky Design", "Author": "Landed Photography", "ReviewID": "R280XYOVWTJLAI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a novelty item but expected something better than a marginal device.  The camera's sensor is on par with a 2009 cell phone camera; granted, I didn't expect stellar images and in no way was this intended to replace my DSLR, but I had hoped that images viewed on a computer would be at least decent.  Not so.  Images in low light are very difficult to accomplish and the flash doesn't help with the results (muddy, grainy prints.The 'fun' part of the camera is printing images on the paper which double as stickers - while it is neat to be able to print images immediately, the glitz wears off once you realize that the images fade very rapidly - I took some pictures of employees at work when I first bought the camera and now the images are just blue blobs that resemble the employees.  The printing does work, but as others have mentioned, the printing function kills the battery.  Another unfortunate feature is that the proprietary charging cable is lost (as in my case), there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get one - I imagine I will have to call Polaroid because the cable is not available on Amazon or the Polaroid website.I gave the camera two stars because there is a certain level of fun when first using the camera and if you don't take it too seriously, it does deliver a good time and if the camera is for a kid, for example, they will overlook the menus, the size of the camera, etc.  Of course, at $200, this is a pretty expensive toy - mine has been on a shelf for months and it doesn't look like a need is going to come up for me to want to use it again.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for a teenager", "Author": "R.

These turned out incredibly nice and I ended up sticking them to those cheap refrigerator magnet ads and trimming to suit. The result is pretty fun.

This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print.

My experience is you get the best results in sunny weather and indoor with flash. Results from scene modes may not give the desired results. A good thing is you only print pictures you like. An extra memory card allows to take more pictures (approx. 2000 on a 4 GB sdhc card). It can also record video, the more light, the better the quality. Forget indoor video. You can also use it as a printer for pictures taken with another camera (jpg format). If you print a lot on the go I would advise to buy an extra battery because printing is power consuming.It is a fun gadget but quality of the camera and prints could be better.*I also have the Z340: if you print a picture taken with the Z2300 on the Z340 it has much better color, so if you hesitate between the Z2300 or Z340 I can recommend the Z340.

It's hard to pull out the battery cover, and all the buttons are very stiff.the battery charger is almost half size of the camera...and you have to connect it to the camera to charge battery, not take battery out...It's really easy to use, which is a good thing. the steps are easy to follow.It also provides lots of shooting modes. like \"sunrise\" \"fish eye\"...However, it is a waste of time to go through those modes by just using the stiff buttons...I don't think it's wise to provide so many shooting modes while it does not have a touch screen.I do not like the LCD screen either. I can't find the info from Polaroid's website but I don't think this LCD has a good quality.The playback function is hard to use too. You'll have to keep click \"-\" or \"+\" button to zoom the image...and when it zooms back to the screen size...there's even a effect...like Powerpoint slidesshow effect...which slows down the speedThe most unacceptable issue of this camera, is the image quality it provides.Polaroid promotes its \"10MP\" resolution...but the reality is...yes, it is \"10MP\", 3648 x 2736px image. but the file size I got is only 950kb, which basically means the image was saved as a compressed medium quality jpg. [I chose the best quality it can save as...]As a graphic designer who deals with image all the time...what I've learned is, a high quality 3648 x 2736px jpg image normally can take up 3MB space or even more...When I looked at the image on m computer screen, I can actually see the pixel noises. There were lots of color noise and some block noise. I didn't even want to try printing any photo from this camera.I called Polaroid customer service and they said 1MB image is really big and maybe this camera is not for me...I've tried put jpg images taken by an iphone into the SD card, but it can not read the pictures and shows \"file error\".
