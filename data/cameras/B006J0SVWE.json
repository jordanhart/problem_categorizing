The only problem with the product is that it wasn't a twist screen as advertised. It was a flip screen. Aside from this I was satisfied with the camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone with the advice that you specify it come with the twist screen if that is important to you.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vivitar 12.1MP, 2.4\" Twist-Screen Digital Camera", "Author": "FoxyK", "ReviewID": "R3D24SXXU02AVU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't like the fact that once I took a picture I could not look at the pictures without the menu on it, as well as not being able to look thru the camera for the pictures I had just taken.  It was like when you take a picture you can see that one but if you took another picture you couldn't get to the other pictures plus the pictures didn't balance out in color.  I am still working with it, it also came with a CD for instructions.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1 Megapixel\n2.4\" TFT(Swivelable)\n8MB SDR(Buffer) & SD card (Upto 32GB)\n4 X Digital Zoom with 4000x3000(12MP In.) 4:3, 3648x2736(10MP In.) 4:3, 3264x2448(8MP) 4:3, 2592x1944(5MP) 4:3, 3648x2048(7MP) 16:9 HD & 1920x1080(2MP) 16:9 HD\nAVI (With Audio) with 1280X720p(HD), 640x480(VGA), 320x240(QVGA)", "Name": "Vivitar 12.1MP, 2.4\" Twist-Screen Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZVT-E6Y8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006J0SVWE"}}
