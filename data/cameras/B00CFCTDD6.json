{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Goodbye Dino-SLRs say hello to the best all around G series camera yet !!!", "Author": "Jholmes", "ReviewID": "R18TXG0Y0O1HTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this on April 24th from Amazon - got tired of waiting and ended up getting it from Sammy's. I take well over 20,000 shots a year ( I have reached 43,000 on my G3 and its still going) I have had the GX1, G3, G5 and now the G6.Spent a full day testing it and here are some results:- Better than the G5 in terms of IQ and sharpness by at least 30 percent and on par with the G3 but much better colors than the latter. The image quality of the G5 was a downgrade from the G3 in my testing over the past year and I tried 3 copies of the G5 and with the 14, 20, 14-42 and 45-150 lenses.- Better features than the G5 - more filters/WiFi/NFC/time lapse/60p video - Panasonic Image app, etc. etc.- The LCD is very clear and very accurate just like the G3 (the G5 was horrible in colors on the screen and did not accurately represent what you were taking a picture of).- Navigation through menus and the Touch Screen are much faster and shot to shot is faster than the G5 and G3.- Picture Quality is very sharp even in low light (see night shot on back porch).- The build at first seems a little more plasticky and lighter than both the G3 and G5 but after holding it and using it for a bit and picking it and carrying it around for a day, it seems the right balance - doesn't tire your hands and doesn't seem like it will break easily - oh and the battery compartment is a lot better than both the G3 and G5.- The 14-42 Kit lens is so much smaller than the previous ones and more solid (metal) - it looks small just like the Olympus ones.- The video is also better on the G6 than the G5 by 20 percent.- Focus is also faster and more accurate on the G6 than both G3 and G5 and is very noticeable if you have used either of the older models for any length of time.- Overall the images come out really nice and sharp. Colors like red and blue and others are beautifully saturated.- I took higher ISO photos in ISO 1250, 1600, 2000 and 3200 and they are very clear indeed - again much better than the water color effect the G5 had at only 1600.- The battery life is better than the G3 and around the same as the G5 - which is pretty good.- I ordered the new F3.5 14-140 Lens and will probably wait forever for it, but seeing how that it is also a smaller lens compared to the prior 14-140 and m43 lenses in general are small you have a complete imaging machine in your hands !My friends this camera has the best of everything you could want from a camera for the Family, enthusiast and even semi-pro, great image and video quality, cool filters, features like stop motion and time lapse, the ability to control and share images from a phone or tablet, nice compact lenses, snappy response.Goodbye Dino-SLRs !!! you are too big, too heavy, too expensive and do not have better image quality - and I am saying this after trying a bunch of Canons and Nikons.******* UPDATE: 7/2/13I tested some more features today and I am still convinced that this is the best compact camera to buy right now.- The new lens and subsequent in-camera software do a great job of eliminating practically all distortion - ie. I am not seeing the outer parts of a picture curved like the previous kit lens.- Also I tried some tree/branches and do not see any Chromatic Aberration (purple fringing).- Panasonic's Auto Focus, AWB and exposure have always been excellent, but this camera really does an excellent job and the color reproduction is so close to what you see with your own eyes.- Time lapse works really well and is completely configurable.- Panorama - this is the only camera that does this properly AND allows you to do 4 different directions - left to right, right to left, up and down and down and up !!! - I uploaded samples.- Panasonic seemed to have fixed problems that the G5 had with the flash indoors - colors would come out too orange.- I used the WiFi feature with the Panasonic Image App from the Play Store on my Galaxy Note 2 to take pics and video and it is very fast.- The ergonomics of the camera are great, my hands are not getting tired of holding the camera and the grip is perfect.If Panasonic made a camera like this with all these features that actually work and are not marketing gimmicks and popped in a nice big full frame sensor they would put Sony, Nikon and Canon out of business !******* UPDATE: 7/12/13Just received the new 14-140 F3.5 !Again I got tired of waiting for Amazon and ordered it Tuesday night from PanaCam and received it Friday Morning !!I now have probably the most full featured Camera Imaging machine available on the market !!!The new 14-140 lens is not that big, its a little fatter and a little longer but balances the camera out perfectly.I put a couple of pics to compare the size of the new lens next to the Kit lens.I am going to spend the day shooting with it and post a review on the 14-140 lens Amazon page.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best combination of still and video capability in mirrorless cameras, unlimited AVCHD record times! - Updates and usage notes", "Author": "Robbster", "ReviewID": "R3CRILZRWN8JKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used the micro 4/3 cameras since Panasonic first introduced the GH1 and GF1 for their unique combination of image quality, sensor size for low light performance, and video capabilities.  My current cameras include the Oly OMD-EM5, EPL1, Panasonic GX1, and now the G6.  The G6 is my overall favorite because it combines very good still capability with the best video capability, including features critical to the use of video in research, including ext. mic and the ability to focus very well in poorly lit locations.Pros+ Excellent still image and video quality across very wide range of lighting conditions.+ Unlimited video recording time in AVCHD format (critical for research sessions which can last 1-2 hours)+ Wide range of video recording resolutions and bitrates+ Supports large capacity SDXC cards, critical for field video sessions.+ AC power option for long recording sessions.+ Very fast focus, even in lower light+ External mic jack with very clean signal, and 19 step mic input level adjustment.+ Can focus in lower light than any other m4/3rds camera that I've ever used.+ Very modern features set - WiFi, NFC, auto Panorama, auto HDR, time lapse and stop motion capabilities+ With the Panasonic X series 14-42 compact zoom lens Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm/F3.5-5.6 Lens for Panasonic Lumix G-Series Digital Cameras (Black), makes the most compact large-sensor pro-level video system possible today.+ Zoom toggle on camera body WILL operate the zoom on the GX PZ 14-42 lens as this lens has a powered zoom (best for video), MUCH more convenient than reaching around to the lens itself to zoom.+ Excellent touch screen interface, very visible in all lightImprovement Areas- Recording time limited to 30 minutes in MP4 video format, even here in NA where recording time has no import duty implications (if I wanted to live by the EU laws, I'd live in the EU, hoping Panasonic removes this limit with Firmware update).- Splits long recordings into 4GB file chunks. Does this seamlessly, BUT, requires stitching back together to create single file for whole recording session, which is ridiculous in this day and age, support exFAT already!  I use FrameRing's Media Splitter to losslessly stitch MTS files back together when needed, funky interface but works. **see update below for an even better approach to combining MTS files- Camera size still a bit on the large size for field use, would love to shrink down to size of GX7 or even GM1 with optional viewfinder.Notes:* 64 GB SDXC provides 8+ hours recording at lowest AVCHD bit rate.* Sony BT Mics (use lower mic input settings) and Shure Lenshopper Shotgun Mic (use 0db setting on mic and mid/high mic input settings on camera) work very well as external mics.* Love my Oly OMD-EM5, BUT, if I could only carry ONE mirrorless camera, would be the G6 for the vastly superior video capabilities.Highly recommended as an all-around compact mirrorless camera, and as the best large-sensor video camera under $1000.********** Power and AV Update 11/16/2013 **********Used this for two straight days shooting research video with great success.  The large sensor of m4/3 shows it's strength in natural room lighting, with great focus speed/accuracy, exposure, color fidelity and dynamic range in the resultant video.  Easily exceeds the quality of good prosumer video cameras with smaller sensors.  And the ability to shoot high quality stills during video recording is a huge plus.Some notes on video setup/use below:**These third party batteries work well and show charge remaining** - Pack of 2 DMW-BLC12 Batteries for Panasonic Lumix DMC-G6K DMC-GH2 DMC-G5 DMC-FZ200 + LCD Screen Protectors + Cleaning Cloth  Despite the very honest warning that battery power indicator will NOT work with these batteries, seems to work fine in the G6 with latest firmware.**Note on Shure Lenshopper Mic on the G6** - Use Odb on the mic and level 16 on the G6 mic input level setting for recorded conversation at 2-3m distance.**Note on powering the camera via AC - purchased the following AC adapter HQRP Kit AC Power Adapter and DC Coupler compatible with Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 DMC-GH2H DMC-GH2K DMC-GH2HK DMC-GH2S Digital Camera plus Euro Plug Adapter, which works great, and much cheaper than the Panasonic branded AC adapter!  Absolutely no problem with fit or running for 8-10 hours straight.  Note that the HQRP kit comes with a battery-shaped adapter that replaces the standard camera battery, and a short cord with female barrel adapter that extends out of the camera via the small door on the side of the camera right above the battery compartment.  Just put in the battery adapter, connect to the AC adapter and you are in business!**Note on powering the camera via an external battery** - In this case, I used the HQRP battery adapter, above, and connected it to the Anker Astro Pro External Battery Anker\u00ae Astro Pro 14400mAh Multi-Voltage (5V 9V 12V) Portable Power Bank Pack External Battery Backup Charger for iPads, iPhone 5S, 5C, 5, 4S (Apple adapters not included), Samsung Tablets (Samsung 30-pin adapter not included), Android Smart Phones and T....  Used the DC out on the Astro Pro, set for 9v, and the \"G\" barrel adapter included with the Astro Pro to successfully power the camera.  While I don't have a real-world run time yet, I expect MANY hours of shooting from this external battery when AC power is difficult or impossible to get.**Note on combining multiple MTS files into a single file the fastest and easiest way possible - DOS copy command!** - As noted above, the G6 automatically splits MTS files at 4GB (e.g., about 40minutes on the 720 60p AVCHD Lite setting).  No frames are lost, BUT, you are left with two or more files representing a single recording session.  This can be a problem depending on what you want to do after the recording session. If you plan to edit from MTS to small segments, no big deal, your (MTS-capable) editing software doesn't care how many MTS source files you are pulling from to create your edited video (I use Sony Vegas Pro FWIW).  If, however, you want to share the WHOLE recording session, or, like me, need to submit for transcription, then one file per recording session is either much preferred or even required.  While you can stitch MTS files together with tools like FrameRing's Media Splitter as I noted above, there is a much faster way, as a poster on dpreviewDOTcom reminded me, which is to use the old DOS copy command in Windows!  Wow, DOS, really?  Sure!  Plus you score major skill points vs. those who don't know what the heck you are talking about!  Here is a sample command line, entered from the directory where the MTS files you wish to combine are stored:  **copy /b 00005.mts+00006.mts 5and6combinedviacommandprompt.mts  Note that the syntax is \"copy /b [FileName1.mts+FileName2.mts...+FileNameN.mts] [OutputFileName.mts]\"  Simple simple simple!  And, to get to a Command Prompt in the Windows folder containing your MTS files, simply hold down the shift key while right clicking the folder where the MTS files are stored, and you'll see an option to \"open command window here\".  This has proven to be VERY fast, and totally reliable so far.Enjoy your G6!", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Hugh C. Kessler", "ReviewID": "R2EDON8EKERNWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over all this is a great camera, I've been a Professional Photographer for over 45 years, and though I'm now semi-retired, I still do some work and I teach at Wayne County Community College- Downriver. I also teach for Digital Photo Academy, so I keep up with the latest in photography. I've been doing Hybrid photography for about 6 months and this camera may be the best camera out there for that type of photography. If you do not know what Hybrid photography is, go to CreativeHybridPhotography.com to learn more.Now on to the camera:I have an Nikon D90, Kodak DCS760, Panasonic G5, several Rollie TLR's  Rollie SL66, Ricoh GR IV, along with several other cameras that I've used over the years. I have to say the G5 is a great camera and the G6 improves on it. Which one is the best to buy, depends on if the extra features on the G6 is worth an additional $400 to you. The viewfinder on the G6 is brighter and faster than the G5, but the G5's finder is still very good. The touch screen is more responsive on the G6. Low light focus was better on the G6, but an update that was released 5 days ago brings the G5 up to the same level. The G6 added Panorama and I have to say it is the best I've seen on any camera to date. Overall I can say that I will do recommend both the G5 and G6 to any of my students that is interest in buying a new camera.The new 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 lens is a great improvement over the older lens that came with the G5. Even though I was happy with the IQ of the old lens, the build quality was only fair to good and zooming was jerky and very bad for video. The new lens is smooth in zooming and much better build quality.I've only had the camera for 3 days, so I'm not sure if there are bugs in the software, or I'm just not doing something right. I notice that when I re-format the card, I'm able to continue on with the file numbering on my still shots, but my video re-starts the numbering a 000. I'm hoping to find a way to turn that off, but as of now have not found it.Overall if you are looking for a great camera at a fair to good price, go with the G6, if you are looking for a camera that is just a small step below great, but at a Great Price go with the G5.As I use this camera more I will update this to keep you informed. By the way as of now I rated this as 4 stars, but only because I do not have all the answers about this camera. If this camera keeps performing as it has been 5 stars will not be enough.7/28/13 update: After using the camera for a while I can say it is great! What I thought was bugs are not there. We every thing works.8/24/13 Update: I still love this camera, but as all products, it is not perfect. What I'm going to be talking about here may be bugs and if they are I hope Panasonic can fix them with an update, or they just may be a problem that I can fix with more research or help from others that had the same problems. So here goes.1. The worst problem is that I will sometime be taking video and when I stop recording the camera freezes and nothing works. Turning it off does not solve the problem and only a battery pull get the camera working again. I'm using a Sony card that is 64gb and is class 10 U1. It may be a card problem since I do not seem to run in to this problem until I have over a 100 photos on the  card. It could also be a bug in the camera since one time it happened with there was only a 120 shot on the card and the next time it happened after the card was formatted and over 500 shots were on the card. I have several other cards, but none of them are 64gb so I'm not sure that testing them would really give me an answer. If any of you have run in to this problem, please let me know.2. When I re-format the card my photos continue the numbering where I left off. This is what I like, but the video file re-start at zero.  So I end up with many duplicate file name on videos and therefore need to re-name them. I've looked through all the menus and cannot seem to find a way to turn this off, even though they do have a way to re-set the still photos numbering system. Please let me know if any of you are having the same problem and if you have found a fix for it. Thanks!I will update this with any answers and fixes I come up with. Until then, for the money and quality of this camera it is still 5 stars to me.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid camera, could have been better for video", "Author": "Jeremy A. Davis \"Wildfire\"", "ReviewID": "R3NTRSQEKS1VG4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The G6 is a great little camera built off of the acclaimed GH2 sensor.I have used the GH2 for years as a filmmaker and was excited for the new features of the G6, hoping to replace my GH2.The G6 performs excellently and to my eyes looks identical to the GH2's quality, not bad for the price.A big perk of the G6 is 1080p at 60fps, not to mention 60p while using ExTele (GH3 is only 30p).The features of the G6 outclass the GH3, though the quality is not as good (no surprise there).Where the G6 performs as well as the GH2, there are some features that are missing, and some features that do not perform as well as they should.The biggest missing feature from the G6 is that there is no live video monitoring from the HDMI out.  You can playback to a TV or monitor using the HDMI out, but you cannot monitor while recording, or even preview.  I use a monitor for a lot of what I do.  Sometimes you need to make sure your focus is precise and a monitor can help you do that while recording.  I also use a jib a lot and you need a monitor to see what you are pointing at.  The lack of this feature is a deal breaker for me.  The G6 cannot replace my GH2 because I need the option of a monitor.  Now you might say \"why not use the wifi to connect to an smart phone or tablet?\"  Well for one, a phone is too small because the monitor space it gives you is only about 1/2 of the phone's screen with the rest taken up by the \"controls.\"  Furthermore, the wifi connection is not always a sure thing. The live view can quickly become jumpy and/or unstable. I haven't talked with anyone who has not had issues with this feature on the G6 or the GH3. Often when I have tried using it, it makes the camera freeze up and whatever I had been trying to record is lost. The only way to unfreeze the camera when this happens in to yank the power -  turning it off doesn't work. (If you look at the \"Lumix Link\" app reviews you can see people's experiences using it - 2.5 stars).  For the high-end production I do, I cannot rely on wifi. I need to know without any doubt that I will have quality monitoring without messing up what I record, and the only way to get that is with HDMI live out.Additionally, I use a B4 mount TV zoom lens and would love to have HDMI monitoring during ExTele mode.  Unfortunately this is not available on either the GH2 or the G6 (or GH3).  I had hoped the new \"focus peaking\" feature would eliminate some of my need for a monitor because it would show me when I was in precise focus when using this lens.  Unfortunately, the \"focus peaking\" feature is not nearly precise enough.  The \"focus peaking\" feature is supposed to highlight only what is in precise focus, but instead it highlights a wider range of focus.  I used this feature on a film shoot and relied too heavily on it.  Focus Peaking told me I was in focus, but I was a touch soft - soft enough we had to go back for a re-shoot which was very embarrassing for me.  If you use Focus Peaking, be sure to use it as an aid, and not rely to heavily on it.  For me, it was too imprecise to be of any use at all.The annoyances that aren't deal breakers:  The SD card slot is in the battery compartment, not on the side of the camera.  This makes swapping out cards a pain.  Making it an even bigger pain is that the battery compartment door is much bigger than it should be (bigger than the GH2) which means if you have a tripod plate of any size attached, it has to be removed in order to open the battery compartment to switch out batteries or SD cards.The other big annoyance is that the settings on the display always disappears after 10 seconds.  Look at the display and 10 seconds after you do anything, include hit record, all your display disappears so you only see video and not your shutter speed, iso, histogram, or anything else that you have selected in the menu to display.  You can bring this back by touching the menu button, but I always refer to my setting while recording.  I have not been able to find anything in any menu which makes the display stay up and not automatically disappear after 10 seconds (this is true on the GH3 as well)...very annoying.Overall the camera performs very well, as I have come to expect from this line.  I only wish Panasonic had gone a little further to make this camera the exceptional workhorse it could be.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a SERIOUS CAMERA!", "Author": "scomigi", "ReviewID": "RDGCVUPJXDPJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On the surface, the Panasonic Lumix G6 looks like a modest upgrade to it's predecessor, the Panasonic Lumix G5.  After all, it came out less than a year from the G5's release, but there are some serious upgrades that set this camera apart from the previous model.I picked up a Lumix G5 in December of 2012 and have shot extensively with it for a year.  It's a terrific camera in it's own right and I was extremely happy with it's performance.  So is the G6 a worthy upgrade?  In a word...  YES!Like the G5 before it, the Lumic G6 is easy to use.  It's intuitive and is loaded up with a ton of great features that will appeal to beginners and pros alike.  Although the G6 is essentially built around the same sensor as the G5, the newly enhanced Venus Processing Engine makes the G6 a much more responsive camera - I found that it locked focus more quickly and securely than the G5 (which is no slouch), and I found that I lost fewer shots with the G6 than I might have using the G5 in the same environments.  The G6 also performs better in low light and has greatly superior video capabilities when compared to it's predecessor.I consider the G5 as basically a \"point and shoot\" video camera - You'll get great video files from it, but you're limited as to your choices. The G6, on the other hand, offers a multitude of options, all the way up to Full HD 1080 60p - and there are slow motion and stop motion modes to boot, as well as an external microphone input jack.Panasonic have also added additional creative filters to the G6, as well as a brilliantly executed panoramic mode.  But for me, the clincher was the Lumix G6's built in wi-fi, which works superbly (and I believe that Panasonic are leading the way in the area so far).  Activate the wi-fi funtion on the G6 and the camera creates it's own network, which allows it to easily be paired with your smart phone or tablet.  It took me about 30 seconds to pair it with my iphone, and once I did, I was able to view what my camera was seeing on my phone, in real time, while controlling the camera's functions from the phone.  You can also share images to the internet using the camera's wi-fi.  The G6 also has NFC (Near Field Communication) capability, so if you have another device that is so equipped (like an Android phone), you only need to touch the device to your camera to pair them together.The only negative I can find at this point is that the camera did feel a little plasticy when I first pulled it out of the box - probably because it's so light, but it feels good in the hand with a comfortable grip, and after shooting with it for a day, it felt plenty solid.  The new 14-42mm kit lens, although much smaller than the previous 14-42mm lens, is a great improvement.  It's performs much better optically, and has a better build quality.Battery life is decent (same battery as the G5).  You should be able to get a full day out if it shooting stills, but if you're going to be using video and wi-fi a lot, you'll find that the battery will drain much quicker, so you might want to pick up an extra or two.On the whole, the Panasonic Lumix G6 is an excellent camera and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Advanced beginner review", "Author": "Alan deLespinasse", "ReviewID": "R94CHIHZA23NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first \"serious\" camera, unless you count the Canon T3i that I had for a couple weeks last fall before returning it. (I wasn't happy with the video performance, mainly because of the serious aliasing problem.) I would have bought a G5 if it had a manual video mode. I would have bought a GH3 if it wasn't so expensive. I was close to buying a GH2 before they discontinued it. I ended up waiting for the G6 to come out.I'm very happy with it so far. For still images, it seems pretty close in quality to the T3i, although of course I can't do a side-by-side comparison. For video, the G6 is much better. I've seen a bit of aliasing, but nowhere near as bad. And the 1080p / 60fps mode is awesome for slow motion (the T3i could only do 720p at that frame rate, from what I remember).I think I found a bug in the 60p mode, though. It lets you set the shutter speed as slow as 1/30 second. That might be pretty cool if it was actually doing overlapping exposures somehow, but what it actually does is take 30 frames per second, and repeat each one. You have to make sure the shutter speed is at least 1/60 in order to get true 60fps. I'm guessing this will be fixed in a firmware update (or else I'm misunderstanding something).I wish it had better low-light performance, but obviously I just need faster lenses. I'm also already wishing for higher video bit rates. Hopefully firmware hacks will allow this in the future, as they did with the GH2.Overall it's meeting or exceeding my expectations.EDIT 2013-07-22:In manual exposure mode for video, it will actually let you set the shutter speed all the way down to 1/2 second. The limit is 1/30 in shutter priority mode. As far as I can tell, it never sets the shutter speed slower than the frame rate in aperture priority or program (full auto) mode, but I haven't done much in those modes.Yesterday I was shooting video (using the manual movie mode on the mode dial) at 60p with a 1/60s shutter speed. I switched over to manual stills mode and used a longer shutter speed for a while, then switched back to movie mode. It then had the shutter speed set to 1/30, which I didn't notice, so I ended up with more footage that was effectively 30fps when I wanted 60fps.I think it should remember the video shutter speed separately from the still shutter speed. For now I'll probably do most of my video shooting in aperture priority mode, since it seems to avoid that issue.There are other things that could be improved in the firmware. Time lapse is one. The minimum time lapse interval is 1 second, which might be reasonable if you were shooting raw images, but there's no reason it couldn't go faster when shooting JPEGs or... wait, why can't it shoot time lapse directly into a video format? It can only shoot stills. It can convert them to video in the playback menu, but then it's limited to the same 1080p, 28MB/s quality that it uses in video mode. If you're going to do any editing at all, you'll get better quality by converting the stills to video in your video editing software.Anyway, I'm nitpicking. The camera gets most things right. It still gets five stars.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The G6 is like a vacation on Guam ... PERFECT!!", "Author": "Guam + Michigan= \u2661", "ReviewID": "RJ9T1KJ6J285J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So when most Americans think of a tropical getaway in the US... most think Hawai'i or the US Virgin Islands. Great places indeed! But for those who want to enjoy a PERFECT alternative to the \"tried and true\", then look at Guam (or even the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands). All-American places, all tropical paradises... perfect from the standpoint of being different!I live in Nashville, TN and see sooooo many tourists with Canon's and Nikon's. I also notice that when a new kid shows up (like a Lumix G series camera) the others take notice. This happened once while I was in the famed Opryland Hotel. Two Canon Rebel owners walked over to a Lumix G5 (previous edition) owner and inspected her camera. I was in earshot of the conversation and the Rebel owners spent quite a bit of time looking at her camera. Later that day, a Nikon owner (as indicated by the wording on his neck-strap) did the same thing. I didn't hear much of that conversation, but I did see his mouth replicate what could be considered a \"WOW\"... multiple times.So when it came time to search for a DSLR or mirrorless system for my beautiful wife, I recalled the Lumix G5 experience. I learned that it was replaced with the G6 and then I tried matching it up against the offerings from Canon (EOS Rebel T5i), Nikon (D5300), Sony (Alpha A65) and Pentax (K-30).I went to various camera shops to try most of them. I got opinions from enthusiasts. I did tons of research. I did even more research. I slept on it. I eventually narrowed it to down to the Lumix G6 and the EOS Rebel. I was so impressed with both and it was like splitting hairs trying to pick a winner.In the end, of course, the G6 won out (by a hair). The NFC option was the deciding factor as my wife and I both have Samsung phones that take advantage of this - and it is seamless in its delivery.Hey I am not at the point where I can throw out terminology like an advanced user, but I can tell you that the experience we are having and the utter love of this camera has been nothing less than full-blown amazing. I can see my wife enjoying the creativity that a camera like this unleashes... and to me, that's priceless.This camera suits her personality perfectly - the pursuit of perfection, outside the mainstream. The G6 really delivers a solid product that leaves nothing but smiles when others ask about it. But more importantly, it captures so flawlessly the moments that make us reflect and reminisce.So I guess it is up to you. Do you want a camera that everyone else has, when there are fabulous other alternatives available. So many people have stories of their trip to Hawai'i, but its that one story about the truly exotic trip to Guam (or American Samoa, or the U.S. Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands) that makes others wish they'd thought of it first.

Jackson", "ReviewID": "R337DYFFNNNFEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first Micro 4/3 camera system and I am loving it so far. The best part of these camera is the small size both of the camera itself and the lenses. I did buy an adapter so I can use all of my Canon lenses as well but you cannot adjust aperture on the lens so I have tended to gravitate more toward using the smaller micro 4/3 lenses.The quality of the images coming out of the camera is very good both for stills and video work. I actually bought this more as a video camera since I already own a Rebel T3i but I have ended up using it a lot more then I expected for photos. On the video side this camera beats the larger DSLR in image quality. You will find it very hard to notice any moire in the image at all and very little if any aliasing. I now have a camera system that does both video and stills so well that I only need one camera for both now.I also love the remote control that you get via the Wi-Fii functions on my Galaxy S4 and my Ipad.  The camera acts has its own wireless hot spot so you can connect to it anywhere and operate the camera remotely through the Lumix imaging app. This comes in handy for situations where I cannot be near the camera or do not want to press the shutter if doing a long exposure. I have also used it to get odd angle photos where it is easier to hold the camera in a place I may not be able to reach as easily to operate the camera through the LCD or EVF.Overall this camera offers all of the video features and quality I want in addition to doing great photos. The Olympus OMD series might be a better dedicated stills camera, but if you want both good video options and stills this camera is hard to beat at this price point. There are more expensive better featured Panasonic cameras like the GH3 and GH4 for video, but the gains for 1080p may not be big enough to warrant the additional expense.  Because of the price of this camera I was able to afford it and then add 3 micro 4/3 lenses.  This is something I would not have had the budget for on the higher priced GH3 or GH4. I might end up buying a GH4 later but at least now I have lenses to go with it and a great camera to use until I have the budget for the next step up.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "The most fun camera I bought in 2013.", "Author": "Kirk Tuck \"Kirk Tuck\"", "ReviewID": "R1M3I0E9NLFETV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the G6 with lens when the price was temporarily at $498.

PANASONIC, please fix this EVF issue.Of course, there are small gripes (voluntarily designed by Panasonic) like everyone else said, such as the fact that:- the SD card slot is located at the bottom of the body, which makes it hard to change SD cards.- There is no live HDMI feed during recording- There is no quick lever toggle switch between AF & Manual Focus.

Not so with the G6.From my understanding the G6 uses the same sensor as the GH2 and equals the camera in all aspects except that it doesn't have all the manual modes for video that the GH2 has, nor does the G6 have the better weather resistant body.  And so is less expense to purchase.I don't shoot video but the camera has time lapse and slow motion as well as an external microphone jack along with some manual adjustment for video.The one and only draw back is that the G6 has a very plastic-like body and isn't of the same aluminum strength of the G5.

This is especially true of the thumb dial and the WB (up on the 4 way switch on the back) but this might just be getting used to the thing. I will also say that I have large hands so I guess I shouldn't blame the camera.  I will update after I have had it a while.  Maybe with time it won't be an issue.The bigger issue is battery life.  It is really not good, about 4 hours of on time with intermittent shooting, which is less than any of my other cameras.  Be sure carry one or two spares especially if you use the LCD a lot.Final analysis - if your neck and shoulder hurt, you want RAW, and don't mind the drawbacks inherent in a smaller sensor, which are  unnoticeable except at large magnification - I can easily recommend this camera.

My first camera purchase was a Canon FT 35mm over 40 years ago. My transition from film to digital was slow, starting with a couple of inexpensive snap shot cameras and moving up to an inexpensive Fuji bridge camera that takes forever to focus. The image quality of these cameras left me wanting something better. My requirements for a new camera were 24p video, touch flip screen, mic input, wifi capable, decent low light performance and reasonably priced. I considered everything from mid-priced DSLR's, the newer long zoom bridge cameras, and Micro Four Thirds. I researched cameras for months. I leaned towards the G6, but Panasonic has an interesting marketing strategy in Georgia. No camera stores or big box retailers in Georgia carry or stock Panasonic Lumix cameras. Seriously. So, I bought the camera online, sight unseen, figuring I could return it if I didn't like it.  I was surprised at how compact and light it was, Not much larger than my Fuji.What I liked: Set up was pretty intuitive. You can figure out the menu structure in a few minutes to be up and shooting. Touch the LCD screen for your focus point and, bang...it's focused. Beginning photographers who are just learning about ISO, shutter speeds, HDR and the various exposure settings will find the art filters and scene modes the quickest way to getting great pics. My first attempt at a night shot was incredibly simple. Set the scene mode to 'cool' or 'warm' evening, put the camera on your tripod and snap away. I couldn't believe how clear and sharp the picture was. The Intelligent Auto button is perfect for snap shots without having to worry about exposure settings in a run & gun situation. It just works. I've only taken one 20 sec. hand-held video clip thus far, but even when panning a shot, there was no vibration shakiness. So far, so good.What's not so hot: The WiFi function is needlessly complex and frustrating to use. You will need to download the Panasonic app on your Android phone. Even after reading the instructions, getting the pics from the camera to the phone requires lots of patience. Half the time, you end up getting the phone to control the camera when what you really wanted to do was transfer pictures. It takes practice to get it right. Again, it shouldn't be that complicated. In bright sunlight, the flip screen is almost unviewable, but that's pretty much the same with any camera.To sum up: Love the camera. It checks all of my boxes. Easy to use, even for beginners. The kit lens is better than advertised. Good in low light. The not so good: WiFi is complex and frustrating. Over all, this camera exceeds my expectations.

I intended to wind up with a GH3 - but as I began to use this gear (with now MANY lenses), I've had great fun shooting stills with the G5s, two GF3s, and an LX7 (with 30,000-frames shot with these cameras in a year!;-). The G5 can shoot very high quality video, but it has no external microphone input, a major shortcoming for serious video work. As the year went on, it became obvious that other cameras in the Panasonic line were including useful features that were not on the GH3. The G6 was attractive for its inclusion of a mic input on a relatively inexpensive camera, and possibly for its Wi-Fi - but the first G6 I bought was disappointing mainly for its relatively poor eye-level viewfinder sharpness compared with the one on the G5, and also for the feel of its \"sandpaper-like\" external finish and the general \"plasticy\" look and feel compared with the G5, and I returned it. Since the EVF was unevenly unsharp across its field of view, I thought that this may have resulted from a manufacturing defect, and I bought another G6 kit from Amazon Warehouse (obviously a \"repack\", but otherwise as new) at a lower price. The viewfinder WAS better (although still not as sharp as the G5's), and acceptable - and the camera surfaces seemed a little smoother and much less unpleasant to touch, so after checking it out, I kept it. A few notable differences/additions compared with the G5 are:- Better image color-balance before \"tweaking\" it (in common with all recent Panasonics, the G5's color can be adjusted on two color-axes separately for all white-balance choices - and also separately for both viewfinders).- Better color-quality on both viewfinders.- Inclusion of an external mic input (although even at maximum gain, the amplification is still too low for many commonly-used microphones, but more gain can be added while editing, along with noise-reduction, if needed).- Focus peaking (although so far I've found this to be of limited usefulness).- Wi-Fi (this has been somewhat troublesome to use, at least with an iPod, but with my two power-zoom lenses, zooms can be controlled from the iPod, stills can be taken, focus can be adjusted at any point within the image, and a small, slightly-delayed view of what the camera \"sees\" can be viewed).The kit lens is a more compact and light-weight basic 14-42mm zoom (28-84mm-equivalent), with a smoother zoom  control and better image-quality than the earlier kit version (it's quite good to the corners by f8 throughout its range with a good sample), and I've decided to keep it even though I have four other lenses that include the 14mm focal-length.

I'm late 40's and in good shape, but honestly, I just got sick of carrying around the dSLR for hours at a time.The compacts I had tried out, like the Olympus E-P2, Nikon V1, and Leica DLUX6 were all pretty cool with both strengths and weaknesses but ultimately not what I would want as a full time replacement to the dSLR. Well, after testing a Lumix G5 at B&H; in NYC, I stumbled upon the G6, but thought it a bit too expensive. Oh well, I thought.Anyway, one day recently, Amazon was having a sale on the G6 with the kit 14-42mm II and I had a bunch of credit card points to use so I got a ridiculous deal that I couldn't pass up. Well, the first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was how LIGHT the camera body is and how SMALL the 14-42mm lens is! My goodness, I had Nikon lenses that weighed 3 times as much as the G6 + lens combo! I was skeptical though. The G6 body feels a little \"plasticky\" and the lens is so small I wondered how good can this be, even after reading all the great reviews online?Well, here's all I'll say after taking the G6 out for 2 days of shooting around town and about 120 pictures later: The dSLR and lenses all got listed on eBay because the G6 and Lumix 14-42mm II lens absolutely blew my mind.

The large number of function buttons is nice, but I would like a bit more feel to them--they are somewhat recessed and can be hard to press if you have larger fingers.The new flip out screen and viewfinder are exceedingly bright and clear.  Just like with all EVFs the viewfinder does gain up some in low light, so it won't show a completely accurate image of what the final picture will look like, but this is common to all EVFs I believe.  The eye sensor works well and changes quickly, but it's important to enable the automatic focus when EVF is activated to get a quick snap out.The wifi works well with my Samsung Galaxy SII and I was able to get the NFC to work as well.  It's important to get the phone pressed up fully against the side of the camera for the NFC--at least with my phone.The new kit lens that comes with the camera is ridiculously small!

It is smaller than I thought it was, and is a great personal camera.EVERYTHING is configurable on it, so you can customize it to your method of shooting.Favorite things:I love the fact that you can adjust the exposure with the rocker near the shutter button - probably my favorite feature. You can see instantly the exposure, adjust it and shoot. Great for backlit scenes etc.The autofocus is quick. I like the Q-menu.The custom menus C1/C2(1-3) are super nice to have.It is so easy to change exposure and and there are so many visual queues you can show in the viewfinder. In fact the display button on the back upper right has half a dozen modes.With the touch screen, typically, if something is on the screen, you can change it right there. You don't have to go hunting for a page in the menu. Just touch and the options pop up.I like viewfinders, so the proximity sensor is great.I love the pinpoint focus which automatically zooms in temporarily so you can see it focus on exactly what you want (the x factor is adjustable on screen (pinch or spread).The resolution is amazing - you can see for yourself here: (click on the 3 dots and make sure you are lookint at the full resolution): [...]Not so favorite:Battery life, although I have had it on quite a bit tinkering. It comes with a 1200ma battery but they make bigger ones.Update: the battery life is great on real photoshoots- I can shoot 500 shaots with the viewfinder and still have lots af battery left over. The big screen uses it up, so use the viewfinder a lot.This is not the camera's fault, just some advice: I've used this on two photoshoots so far and the the only problem I've had is my cheap SD card I purchased could not keep up with the bracketing and drive modes. So if you plan to shoot a lot of RAW files, invest in a good pro SD card. I will try using a low res-jpeg+raw next time to see if it will keep up since I only use the jpegs (on a photo shoot) to choose which raw photos to develop.You cannot charge it through the USB cable ... in fact it is a proprietary USB cable - not a micro USB, which doesn't really matter though. There are cheap power cords for it if you use it to record video or do a lot of studio work.It does a great job of focusing except when it's dim and there are no lines or little contrast, but the manual focus is right there, so it too is not a big deal.The Stability is built into the lens, which isn't a big deal except my 35mm lenses are automatically 2x with the crop factor, so it may be of some concern, but I haven't received my adapter yet to actually tell or not.I have to swing the screen out or turn off the touch focus because my nose hits the touch screen changing the point of focus. Again, not a big deal because it's easy to turn on & off and I use the pinpoint focusing any way (awesome !!!).I did not want an DSLR because of the noise, and you cannot shoot hybrid simultaneously.DSLRs are old technology - just like points & condensers in cars - rather pointless these days.In fact many don't match the sensor size, which is really the point of THRU THE LENS, so why ????While the pictures of this camera make this look like a DSLR - in reality it looks sorta like a Sony NEX with a small viewfinder on top.I've heard detractors saying the depth of field won't create a pleasant blur - don't listen - it blurs nicely. And with legacy lenses, you may find yourself stopping it down to get more DOF. You can see for yourself on web DOF calculators for MFTs.Overall it is a wonderful camera, and all others are so far in it's rear-view-mirror it will be advanced for some time to come. Just a hint... buy it just before the usual buying seasons and you will get it much cheaper... $585 in mid-January before tax season or mid-November before Thanksgiving.I will probably edit this as I use it more.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "brian", "ReviewID": "R1KRU3Z8HD0MQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has proven to be portable, high quality, fast, enjoyable and it has helped me to get out and take more photos.The video quality is excellent. The manual mode is great. The touch screen is phenomenal, the external audio input rocks, with the 20mm f1.7 pancake lens i have been knocking it out of the park. I'm looking into adding the Olympus 45mm f1.8 portrait lens (many sources say that lens one reason to get a micro 4/3 camera).But for the price and the ease of use I would definitely give this camera a 5 star rating.The kit lens is of course disappointing and I hardly if ever use it. A telephoto or a super zoom I believe are also in my future.If you're shopping for lenses, be sure to look at the micro 4/3 lens site. I think it's four thirds .org or something.The only thing i would note is that the flash is weak, but that's too be expected for a camera at this price and size.I have an iPhone 4, but if I had a phone that had an android (or maybe even the iphone 5?), there's a special wifi connection that works quite well with this camera. The wifi connection app on my phone is slightly harder to get into, but works quite well once I've got the wifi on and the app open on the phone. I can control the camera from this app or upload images right to facebook. videos can't be uploaded to facebook, but with the 60fps & 1080p that this camera is capable of, i don't think your data plan would appreciate it if you could.The fact that several companies (Olympus & Lumix/Panasonic) are using the micro 4/3 system adds to the value and I believe also the possibility for future development. In the mirrorless world, the big two have a lot of catching up to do and Olympus with their OMD-EM5 and Lumix with it's GH3 (and little brother the G6) will seriously be giving them a run for their money.All in all, I am totally stoked about photography because of this camera and I can only see myself getting more involved using this tool.

I purchased this camera for my wife, something that is more compact, lighter and hopefully easier to use.  The \"easier to use\" was probably in my mind not hers.  The camera is loaded with a lot of great features which include NFC, WiFi, touch screen interface and various select-able shooting modes which takes the guess work out of what can be challenging camera settings for ISO, aperture and shutter speed.One thing to keep in mind is that this is what is considered a micro 4/3rds system.  meaning the sensor is a hybrid used by camera manufactures Lumix (Panasonic) and Olympus.  A 4/3rds chip size is the smallest of the 3 most popular senors out there (Fullframe - equivalent to an original 35mm film size, an APC and 4/3rds). As such, the glass that you attach to the camera itself, is just as important if not more so with the smaller sensor size.  The 4/3rds systems generally suffer in detail and noise, especially at the lower light settings, as compared to the full frame or APC size sensors. This camera, with the kit lens (14 -42 mm f 3.5 -f 5.6) did ok in brightly lit scenes, but suffered with image quality and noise at lower light scenes.  I also purchased the 45 -150mm f 4 - f 5.6 to go with the camera giving it a good range for shooting various type scenes. The camera and the lens were ok from my perspective but for spending close to $1000 I expected better quality shots. I was very surprised at the image distortion (converging verticals and barrel distortion) of the 45 - 150 but then again for $260 my expectations were high and see my comment above about the quality of the lenses used. Now one option you can consider is ditching the kit lens in favor of one of the Leica lenses designed for this camera but the sticker shock is usually enough to change your mind. I ended up sending the camera and lenses back for a refund (no problems there, as Amazon handled the returns as expected). So bottom line is if you are looking at purchasing a camera in this price range I would recommend that you consider one of the newer Sony's (a500 & a600) or one of the Nikon N1 series cameras, the larger sensor size with the kit lenses will provide you a  better photo quality.You do get what you pay for but with the camera and kit lens selling for ~$700 there are better options (I should have done a better job in researching prior to purchasing).", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exposure Issues", "Author": "Jeffrowan10s", "ReviewID": "R21X91AHK4BCRV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Lumix G6 for several days now, and while it is a fine camera that is generally worthy of the praise it's gotten, I've encountered what I believe is a flaw in its exposure algorithm. Simply put, left on its own, the camera does not expose low light scenes accurately. Let me explain: Do you remember the old days of film photography, when while using color negative film, you thought you had shot a perfect sunset with your human subject in silhouette? When you took the film to the store for processing, the prints came back with your sunset washed out, and your subject no longer in silhouette. The reason of course, was that the automated film processing machine analyzed your negative, decided it was too dark, and accordingly bumped up the exposure by several stops.(Which is why most serious shooters would shoot slide film, where wysiwyg prevailed). Well that is what this camera does to low light scenes. It takes a dark scene, rich in shadow and nuance, and adds several stops, creating what it \"thinks\" is the correct exposure. The result is an inaccurate rendering of the scene. Now, of course this can be offset by downshifting the exposure compensation, but that is a nuisance, particularly when my iPhone 5 exposes the exact same scene perfectly (as does my Samsung MV900f point and shoot). I'm assuming that there is nothing wrong with my particular unit, since in normal light, the camera exposes perfectly. In all of the various discussions of this camera, I have seen no mention of this issue. If you own the camera, and have found otherwise, feel free to comment below. That said, I still gave it 4 stars for its many other attributes.Update: 8/22/13 Ultimately, I decided to send the Lumix G6 back. Not that it was a bad camera, but I felt I could do better. After using it for a week,I felt that the 28-84mm kit lens (3.5-5.6 aperture) was not only limited in range, its slow aperture bugged me, as well as the fact that the zoom was manual, not motorized. In place of the G6, I bought the Lumix FZ200 bridge camera, which offers a fixed (and motorized) Leica 25-600mm zoom lens, with a constant aperture of 2.8 The upgrade in speed and flexibility is enormous.The FZ200 lacks a touch screen (touch screen is nice, but don't need it), and is 12 megapixels rather than 16. As long as the lens is sharp (it is), I don't need to participate in the megapixel arms race. Basically, I feel that I got a better camera, with a far better lens, that, at $519, costs $350 less than the Lumix G6.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inferior to My Prior Lumix Camera", "Author": "Karen Surber", "ReviewID": "R2AEITJZYX3PKU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I LOVED my Lumix I had prior to it falling into a pail of water in my barn! I only paid $400 for a little point and shoot. That Leica M2 duplicated lens was awesome for a little camera!!! This camera was unbalanced and uncomfortable to hold. But the most important  to me is the lens. It was not as good at all as my little Lumix.Returning the camera and other items became a time consuming process. The first girl was sweet but knew nothing. I had spent over $600 and she could find no order for me. I gave her the order and tracking numbers and did all I could to help. Still it was a very LONG phone call. Then she wanted me to print the return label and authorization paper. I explained that I had no printer and could it be sent snail mail? I was told no. Finally I think she said shed have UPS sent the label and that she would confirm that to me in email. I got the email. It stated that all I would have to print was the authorization! If I didn't have a printer to print the label - - - - - - would I then be able to still print the authorization?! It made no sense to me! Over an hour on the phone I believe- - - - - - Then back to square one. I can't return it. She was nice but inept. Then I got a very nice man who said he would take care of it. He made a mistake too. UPS was to come and pick up my package. Each day I waited and was promised this is the day I had to stay home all day to wait for the pick up! The third day the UPS guy finally told the truth. The nice man at Amazon had put my P O Box as the address and they were NEVER according to that young man going to come. I said on day one the girl called to get my physical address and promised that was the day!!??? He said Amazon would have to correct the address  - - it was against UPS policy.  Then I was told to go to a UPS shipping store when I once again called Amazon to find a way. It took so many attempts and contacts and days to finally ship the camera back. They allowed me to use their computer to print a prepaid label and the authorization. Finally I was able to return the camera. So, I looked further and found the other Lumix cameras. I needed to spend about $3000 to $6000 to get one of them. To be honest, after this one I was done and didn't trust them anymore as far as the lens . So, I remembered my great Nikon Ftn 35mm. This time I went out and bought the Nikon 7100 with the 18 to 140mm lens. In that camera they have eliminated the low pass filter completely. I bought it at Best Buy. Their deal was slightly better than Durys Camera Store. IAmazon was a better deal but I was afraid to spend that much after all I had been through.  I like Amazon. You did a good job of taking care of this in the end even emailing your other seller of the battery who also returned my money minus tax and shipping. However, I just didn't want to take a chance spending twice the amount and possibly having a long, difficult process to return it if something was wrong. It is a great camera!
