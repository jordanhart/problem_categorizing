{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Camera for Taking Everyday Shots", "Author": "Andrew J. Freyer", "ReviewID": "R2ZWA3N81UZHKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lets get to the bottom line:The Good:This camera takes excellent pictures - as a response to CNET and other reviewers who note that the DSC-T300's pictures are soft/noisy/high contrast/ et cetera are reviewing this from a professional photography point of view. Comparing this to an SLR or any other non-subcompact isn't reasonable. Just like we wouldn't compare a Chevy Pickup with a BMW sedan. Photos taken with this camera are intended for \"everyday shooting.\" I will use this for vacations, parties, or tours. I would not use this to photograph my own wedding. For everyday shots, the quality is superb. If you are looking for a professional camera in a subcompact chassis, then this is about as close as you will come.The optical zoom is fantastic, as is the image stabilization -- I do not have a very steady hand. Of the first few test shots that I took with this camera, one was of a license plate from a car parked about 100 meters away. I zoomed in with full optical and digital zoom, and snapped a photo of what looked like a very grainy and pixelated white blob jerking quickly around the screen. To my surprise, when I viewed this shot, the camera had cleaned it up so that not only was there no motion blur, the license number was perfectly visible. I could even see the county name on the bottom! Needless to say, I won't be taking many pictures from this far away, but still it is good to know that the feature is there if I ever need it.The smile shutter works surprisingly well, and I use it all the time. What not many of the other reviews that I read talked about was the functionality of the smile shutter. When the feature is enabled, the camera is not in normal photo mode. You will have to take it out of Smile Shutter mode if you want to resume taking pictures. Once enabled, the smile shutter constantly looks for faces, and puts an orange box around each one. It will identify up to 9 faces. Once a face is ID'd, it judges how much the person is smiling, and if they are smiling enough, then a picture is taken. It will take pictures of smiles until you take it out of smile mode. In fact at a party of mine, I put the camera on a tripod, set it up for smile mode, and told people to go smile in front of it. By the end of the night, every single person had a smiling portrait in my camera. Excellent feature. The funny thing is, no one believes that the camera actually can determine who is an isn't smiling - so when they finally see the red-eye flash go off, 90% of people cant help but smile a real, and perfectly captured, smile of pleasant surprise.  When in this mode, this camera only captures happiness.The Add-A-Smile Feature is completely useless, but because of it, your camera will be a hit. I have tried the add-a-smile feature on 20+ people and more often than not, they end up looking creepy. However, this is hilarious. You will never seriously use this feature, but its a joy to have all the same.Video is surprisingly good. When in \"fine video\" mode, I would be hard pressed to tell the difference between this and broadcast quality. \"Fine video\" does take lots of memory though - 1 hour ~ 4 GB.  To fit more video on the card, you can switch to \"standard\" but unless you are using this ONLY for youtube, don't bother with standard.Touch Screen - Once you learn it, it is a very intuitive interface.The Bad:There is a learning curve on the touch screen - Most people will be turned off initially by the touch screen. I have found that the learning curve has put people off from borrowing my camera to take pictures.  I always have to explain how to use it. Not a huge deal, I bought the camera for me, not for people who want to take pictures of me.Fingerprints collect on the screen - well, its a touch screen, what do you expect?Bottom Line: This is a great camera for everyday shots. For shots that you do not intend on editing professionally, this is a great camera.  For shots that are for viewing pleasure, this is a great camera. If perchance you do want to edit professionally photos taken by this camera, the resolution gives extreme detail.All in all, I have never considered returning this camera.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great incarnation of the DSC-T series, but stingy Sony!", "Author": "dosers \"dosers\"", "ReviewID": "R2FACC20CIQD5U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As the previous reviewer stated, this camera overall is a joy. The quality is great, both in build and pictures. Very little 'fringing' in the Zeiss lens, zoom is fast (faster than previous DSC-T models) and quite.My biggest problem on the new design (it's a thinner and has less physical buttons than a T-30 or 50) is the relative design flaw of not having a good way to open and close the lens cover. This was a lot better on previous models.It definetely takes getting used to.Another issue is with Sony - it's so apparent they are getting ever so stingy, in that they are including less and less in the box. The biggest insult to consumers in my opinion is the MISSING smart battery! Until now, Sony supplied batteries that would tell you the exact amount of minutes left on the charge; and they were quite accurate. In the 300 no more. But, 'don't despair' - it can still do it, only Sony didn't want to spring for the cash to include said battery in the box. If you want the 'feature' of telling time left on the battery there is an insert in the box, pointing you to Sony's website and how to spring another $50 to buy said battery (Amazon carries it too).It's just too bad - I don't even mind the extra charge so much as I don't see the point of Sony offering less features on their new top end DSC camera and then charge extra to get back 'up to spec'. Charge $20 more from the get go and include the darn thing....", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but remember more MPs is not equal to better pics!!!", "Author": "Ernesto Diaz Cevallos \"egdiaz\"", "ReviewID": "R72IFF99KFDXB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big fan of the Sony's T series, I've already own the very first DSC-T1, the discontinued T-33 and now T-300.I sticked to Sony after the DSC-T1 because I wanted to keep using my MS Pro Duos; but soon after I realized that Sony makes cameras that are not only great for pics, but also their designs make an statement (bring this baby to a party and you should be aware because 99% of the party would like to take it to their homes).So, now that I shared my reasons for buying this camera, here comes my review, quick, simple an concise.The automatic mode is not flawless, especially in indoor night pictures, you should adjust the scenes mode so the camera really uses the flash automatically. The program mode haven't change since the T-33, basically the same options, and if you know how to use it, you get good pics.The remarkable \"new\" setting is the Smile Shutter, once you have configured (personally i prefer it in high sensitivity) is a really fun tool. And the face detection is Amazing.  Sony has really improved himself in this issue.But as I mentioned in the title of my review, more MPs is not equal better quality.  Once you start zooming the pics you can notice some rugged edges, distortion and a little bit of inaccuracy in the colors; but you would never notice that in a printed A3 pic.  Once again, this is a amateur camera, and you are not paying over $1000 like in the 10 MPs pro cameras, so complaining is not that fair.Once you can get used to the touch screen controls, using it is a breeze... I might complain that ask for confirmation for almost everything, but I guess the worst OS ever aka Windows Vista has already got me used to that....Finally a few recommendations: Buy the camera together with the LCD screen protector and the Sony LCJTHC/B Genuine Leather Jacket Case with Stylus for the DSC-T70 & DSC-T200 (Black); if you want to keep it with scratches from the very beginning.  And a large MS Pro Duo 8GB and up I recommend.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good, but", "Author": "Lisa Guinn \"lisle_g\"", "ReviewID": "R1L154W7G9Y5I2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera had a lot of features that I wanted:* good size of LCD screen* cover for lens* internal zoom - so no mechanical lens in/outBUT I forgot to check on these things that it DOESN'T have* Ability to connect to PC via mini-USB (uses a Sony proprietary USB connection)* Ability to charge the battery inside the camera (uses a separate charger)* Ability to use a \"standard\" SAN disk (uses a Sony memory stick)* A view-finder, so that I don't have to try to use the LCD screen outdoorsIt's a good camera, but I probably would not have purchased it if I had done a better job of my research up front.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "Sikandar Porter-Gill", "ReviewID": "R1EKA5JGAWBLH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched cameras for over 2 months, but could never find one that was right for me.  I went to BestBuy, Walmart, Target, and other stores looking and trying out their various cameras.  One day I came along the T300.It is extremely user friendly, has a long battery life, and an excellent zoom (wonderful for novices and professionals).  The camera has many options including environmental settings, flash, image size, timer, and macro settings.The video has wonderful quality, with the option to sync your camera to an HDTV.The only negative part of the camera is that I had to buy a new memory stick (Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo), because the camera only accepts these types of sticks--it does not accept the conventional SD memory sticks.The touch screen is very easy to use, and can be used with your finger or the provided stylus!I had been planning to buy the Panasonic DSCW170, however, after trying both out and comparing it the the Canon and Casio cameras--the Sony T300 was the best.  I know that you will be satisfied!****UPDATE****I have been using the video alot on the camera, it is excellent!  You have many choices, such as the quality, and the aspects of where it will be viewed (email attachment, HDTV, Computer...).Also, the provided component cable/USB cable, give you easy connection to your compatible TV, it is beautiful on my Panasonic HDTV!Defiantly recommended!Enjoy! :)", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "First Review! Great Camera...", "Author": "R. Gates \"S_Pack\"", "ReviewID": "R3263DGUCSVWGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow this camera is amazing. I am extremely happy I forked over the extra cash for the T300. I was originally going to buy a Casio Exilim EX-Z100, but I am so much happier with this one. Its pictures aren't SLR quality and the whole painting in the camera thing is kinda dumb, but the 10.1 mega pixels and the 5x optical zoom and the optical image stabilization and the 3.5\" touch screen really sold it for me. Plus its awesome just flipping down the door on the front to power it on. The new face detection is improved over the T200 and it can do multiple smiles on the smile shutter. Ya the touch screen takes some getting getting used to and it's annoying to say ok or back every two seconds, but it's a touch screen. I mean come on. For me the pros outweigh the cons by a lot. There is nothing out on the market today that is as innovative and new as this camera, plus you know its quality because it's a Sony.PROS:-5x Optical Zoom (Very versatile and it starts at 33 mm, so its technically wide angle)-10.1 Mega Pixels (I know mega pixels don't make a camera, but I crop a lot so the more the merrier)-Optical Image Stabilization (You really need optical, digital is about as useful as digital zoom)-3.5\" Touchscreen (Touchscreen interface could be better, but its still a huge display and good for showing off pictures. Plus it's still a touchscreen)-Face Detection and Smile Shutter (Yes I know every camera has face detection now, but this one actually works. On up to 8 faces! Plus it can distinguish between children and adults and the awesme smile shutter now works on 8 people!)-Sleek Design (It's super-thing and the brushed aluminum looks awesome. Same with the sliding door)-Sony Quality (You're getting a trusted product. Plus it feels solid and well built, even though its light and its built with top of the line materials)CONS:-Touchscreen Interface (Bigger screen is cool, but it's still kind of a new technology for cameras and its not the most responsive screen ever)-Neurotic Menu (It asks you if you're sure to do things and then if you're ok and then if you really want to switch it and when you're done you have to hit back)Other than some interface issues, this is a very good sexy little machine. Don't expect it to be an SLR and ISO 3200 is  somewhat useless but it's good features outweigh the bad by a lot. Use it for a couple of days and you will fall in love with it. Trust me its worth $400.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Impressive, innovative, poor image quality", "Author": "Jim Hammond", "ReviewID": "R1CJIRSPFKJLNP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought one of these while on vacation, and thus I did not have time to perform my usual research. After 3 weeks, 1000 pictures, and an email exchange with Sony tech support, I returned it. I was glad to pay the $60 restocking fee.The camera was not defective. The images of this 10 Megapixel camera simply have the detail of a 5 Megapixel camera because the camera is designed to automatically perform digital contrast and color enhancement. This is my conclusion after owning one, after reading every review I could find on the internet, and after owning two of the predecessors to this camera including the very first model -  the DSC-T1.This detail destroying \"enhancement\" makes the photos look prettier - until you enlarge them.I was really looking forward to zooming in on one of my photos of ancient Native American rock art that I could not have captured with less than 5X zoom and 10 Megapixels. When I got home and enlarged the image to full size, I looked at the adequately enlarged space where the thin and faint lines of the rock drawings should have been.It wasn't there.Thin and faint lines are EXACTLY the kind of detail that contrast and color enhancement eliminate.Pros: Image quality is the only serious defect of this camera, and of course, image quality is not necessarily the single most important feature of a camera. If you value a well-constructed ultra-compact ultra-cool camera with good low light capability and about 5 Megapixel resolution that has already been digitally enhance for beauty, then you would love this camera. Another truly valuable feature of this camera, is that it can zoom while recording video. I know of no other compact digital camera that can do this - including previous Sony models. Downloading photos and video to a computer is lightning fast, although I was using the more expensive high-speed version of Sony's proprietary memory stick that only works with Sony products.Cons: This is a very expensive 5 megapixel camera. It has no USB port - you must use the bulky proprietary cable provided with it. You cannot charge it using the cable - you must remove the battery and place it in the charger unless you buy the cradle that is not included. The touch screen is the only way to switch between photo and video modes - which is as clunky as it sounds. It is easy to accidentally touch a button on the screen. If you make the screen bright enough to be usable on a sunny day, then the battery life seems like about 30-40 minutes. Like most cameras, the video format is not compatible with the iPod Touch. It uses Sony's proprietary memory stick that only works with Sony products.Later this month you can choose from the new DSC-T500 or DSC-T700. The DSC T700 is actually slightly less capable (only 4X zoom) but is slimmer. The DSC-T500 is impressive because it adds stereo sound recording and 720p high definition video. It also moves the photo/video switch back to an actual physical switch.I hope Sony improved the image quality on these new models, but their web site implies no such improvement. In fact I pointed out to Sony Tech support that their press release boasted that T700 images could be enlarged to 8X10, which is a tacit admission of poor image quality because a true 10 Megapixel camera should be capable of twice that. Sony subsequently changed their story to claim their images could be enlarged to A3 size - but did they improve these two cameras at the last minute - or did they simply change their marketing literature?", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Delightful", "Author": "Clarisse Cruz", "ReviewID": "R3O4V2MP8LZ5A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I still had a decent working camera, the first of the T-series.

I have small hands so the buttons don't bother me at all. I got it in black as well and got a great deal at circuit city for it.

I had to buy this one to replace and thought I would get similar, but advanced camera with the same image taking/making ability.  It is not.  This is a sore sequel to the DSC-T1.  That camrea had \"breath-taking\" high definition clarity to the images.  I used it in the macro and panoramic and got consistent images constantly.  THIS camera is one to AVOID.  The images are blurry for macro, portrait, group or distance.  It is just an inferior camera to the other offerings.  I first thought it was me, so I reviewed the owner's manual, my settings, my subjects, my software.  It all came back to this camera.  For $600 I want near perfection.  It is more like a fixed focus camera.  As usual with Sony, it has a lot of bells and whistles that have nothing to contribute to image quality. It is a waste of money if you are looking for high def photos.  I have had it a year and five months and am very very sorry I did not return it. I sound mad, I am not.  I just don't want any other consumers to get this bad camera.  DO NOT BUY this to make good photos, you won't get them.  Look elsewhere.

I was initially a bit reluctant to buy this one seeing the reviews on CNet and other sites. Yes, the image quality is not worth $400 and  you can get the same images for 100 bucks less but its sporty look and finish is what made me crave for this beauty. The red metallic frame looks very funky. People actually come to you and start chatting about the camera when they see T300 in your hand. This has happened to me more  than once. It does not have protruding lens system and can still go upto 5x zoom which is very helpful for some special shots. The little zoom knob on the top corner is very simple to use and makes the zooming experience a lot better. The sliding cover is good but it is not comfortable to grab the camera while taking a shot as it is too thin to maintain a good grip. I had a canon SD1000 and the quality of images is much better with T300. It has a lot of good features like multi-mode face detection and smile shutter (though smile shutter is practically of no use as it is a very limited technology) It is highly portable and ultra compact.Now the pinch of salt. The images are not very crisp at the corners and higher ISO pics look like they have been painted by a novice. It has a lot of modes to chose from but it gets really bad at night when you want to shoot both the subject and the background. If you use the flash, background gets washed and if you use the night mode, the subject is not very clear. In all other conditions this camera gives good pictures. I have tried some really difficult snaps and this camera has delivered. Also  the time taken to save an image (even at the highest image quality) is too small and you can take another pic within 2 seconds. The hyped touch screen display lives upto your expectations. Though its not highly sensitive and there is a learning time associated with this technology, once you get a feel of it, its really very simple and a fun to use. I really hated these buttons and knobs on previous cameras but the menus in T300 are simple to use. Yes you have to confirm after each n every adjustment you make using the touch screen. This may be irritating at times but unavoidable. Also it lacks a view-finder and i cant use my standard SD card with this as it uses a patented memory stick duo technology. This further adds to the cost of purchasing T300.Overall, if you want a designer camera, be the center of attention in a party and don't mind spending 400 bucks for making the experience of taking quality pictures fun, T300 is definitely for you. However don't expect the image quality to be at par with SLR's and if you are really into photography this would look like a child's toy.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Good...", "Author": "P.

If you're willing to learn how to deal with the arcane menu system, you'll be able to take surprisingly sophisticated pictures.  I've had it for a couple of months, and I just returned yesterday from a week in Hawaii, where I really had the chance to use it.At the outset, let me say that I drastically misjudged the rate of power consumption.  I gave it a full charge before departure, but with only moderate use, it was drained by day three of my vacation.  I used the camera in the cell phone for the rest of the trip!  This was my own fault.  I should have taken the battery charger with me.  My cell phone is a Verizon LG Dare, which does a good job at 3 megapixels.  The Sony is, of course, 10 megapix.Nevertheless, I keep asking myself how much more is the Sony giving me than I would get with the cellphone camera?  I leave that up to the user to decide.I ordered the special cable that allows me to view the Cybershot pictures on the HDTV.  This is a must.  I save my pictures on the PC using Picasa, the free software from Google.Some critics say the pictures from the Cybershot DSCT300 are \"noisey.\"  I'm not sure what this means.  I think that most people will be quite pleased with the results.  I expect that with more familiarity with the camera, my results will improve.As I said in the very beginning, this is not a \"point and shoot\" camera.  It has a wide array of menus and adjustment options.  Without learning what these options do, one is not making full use of the technology.  It would be like driving a car in first gear.Taking movies works best with a stable platform, especially when the zoom is in full effect.  My son who is a professional videographer introduced me to the cheap monopod, which works great.

The picture quality is OK for a compact although I still prefer the picture sharp, quality of my Canon Digital SLR. My wife primarily uses the Sony, but I shoot a few pictures once in a while. Here are the things my wife likes about the Sony Cybershot DSCT300camera.Very large 3.5\" screen in the back. Only a few buttons on the top which makes the camera appear more simple due to lack of buttons, but most of the controls are on the touch screen. A plastic pen atttached with a small, black string is included which is simliar to a PDA or Palm Pilot. Gives the camera an overall high tech feeling like an I-phone.Powering the camera on & off is done by simply sliding the front cover over the lens (power off) and away from the lens (power on).Musical slide show. I think it's kind of cheesy, but my wife really enjoys this part of the camera the most. The slide show can be customized with up to eight different music tracks from your CD or MP3 tracks. The camera also comes with eight different stock tracks, but it's really more fun to add your own. The slide show can also be presented in different styles like a computer screen saver.Variety of colors to choose from. Most digital cameras are always your standard, silver color. My wife liked the red color which was the one we purchased. I think pink would have been her second choice.Smile detection. Individual faces are highlighted in orange or red squares to detect individual smiles. Fun, but not really necessary yet nevertheless a fun feature to have.Create a smile. You can turn frowns or non-smiles to smiles, but the actual result is kind of creepy looking. Still fun to have and you can get quite a few laughs at a party with this feature.So far the only thing I don't like about the camera is the overuse of the touch screen causes a few fingerprints or smudges on the screen which is expected. I installed a slim LCD protector on the screen of my wife's camera to protect the stock screen. Overall, I recommend this camera for everyday to causal shooting.

I LOVE it.  One of the features it has that similar cameras don't have (among many) is the ability to zoom while taking videos.  It also has face/smile detection and some other really neat features such as the ability to filter children faces, or adult faces, or pictures that contain faces, etc.  Also, the ability to edit red-eyes, rotating pics, crop, etc., before downloading to the computer is convenient.The amount of time from pushing the button to taking the picture is almost nothing - virtually no lag time.  The subsequent pictures are just as fast - you can take multiple pictures in a row fairly quickly (it has a burst feature which takes several pictures in a row very fast, but even without using the feature, it's fast compared to pther digital cameras I have used).The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not as user-friendly as the other Sony T models - everything is through the touch screen (which is neat), and not on knobs on the outside of the camera, but I assume that's because there are so many features they had to do it that way.I purchased an 8GB memory stick duo for a little over $[...] after rebate from big retail electronics store.  I'll probably never need 8GBs, but just in case, and it was a great deal.I will probably buy an extra battery in the near future.  I haven't needed it yet, but from reading other reviews, and also so i won't be without picture-taking ability, it just makes sense.I also recommend purchasing a screen protector.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony at its Best!!", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R15DQGNTK5MD2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this item and it is beyond amazing.

I usually use an SLR camera but I bought this one for my wife because of is large optical zoom range and the large range of options that can be employed in its use.  She is used to point and shoot cameras but she is really getting more excited about photography by occasionally changing modes or settings.  The camera also has an \"easy\" mode for point and shooters.  The small auto focus Zeiss lens with the large zoom range focusing onto a 10 GB sensor makes pictures that are very large and clear, so it would pay to purchase a larger memory card.  My wife usually shoots at a 5GB size because it is more than sufficient for 8x10's.  If she knows she is shooting something special that she will print in a larger size. she will move up to the full 10MB size.  A 5GB setting will usually produce picture of rough 2.5MB while 10GB will produce pictrures of roughly 5MB. Other than being a little more expensive than some of its competitors, I can find no real faults with the camera.

The LCD screen is placed most unobtrusively and also the buttons and controls were splendid.2) Battery life was about 200 pictures before you'd need a recharge3) The camera could sit on a desktop since the bottom was very good and the mechanism to remove the battery was also unique in it's own sense4) **IMPORTANT DEAL MAKER FEATURE** Though a little bigger than my present Canon, the brightness in dim images is something I miss. This camera has a great ability to take warm, vibrant crisp shots in not so bright locations.Note: If you are looking to take a picture in poor light, hold the camera steady for about 2 seconds before you hit click.5) The quality of images overall were much less grainy than the 12.1 megapixel Canon.6) The LCD screen is huge, the controls are amazing, not once did I ever receive a lag, the menu is more INTUITIVE and BETTER PLACED than the CanonCONS -The one bad thing about this camera is that while it costs a considerable sum compared to the other digital cameras, it only had an inbuilt space of 16mb.

I absolutely love it. It is small - as small as a cell phone and very thin. It fits in my purse or jeans pocket, so it ends up going everywhere with me. Special moments at restaurants, at the park with the kids, at school functions, etc., would have been lost in the past because it was too much effort to carry a bulky camera around. Now I am having a grand time taking pictures of EVERYTHING.I think the user interface is great. It is easy to use, and it also feels good, clicking on the options with the little plastic stylus that attaches to the wrist cord. It's convenient and fun.The pictures are coming out great. I'm not a professional photographer by any means, so mostly I just depend on the \"Auto\" feature, and it works fine. Even close-ups of plants and flowers turn out well. You can take a picture at full resolution, then trim it down to size, and get excellent focus of small objects.My kids are getting a kick out of the smile-recognition feature. It's just a gimmick, but it is fun and it seems to work well.

The Nikon lens system is fantastic in daylight but I got poor indoor shots(? flash poor)with bright bluish subjects but blackened background).I initially tried theOlympus stylus 1010 10.1 Megapixel (about 250 US Dollars),Olympus stylus 1030  10.1 megapixel (about 399 US Dolars)andcanon SD 1100 8 MPixel(about 250 US Dollars).I actually bought and returned the 2 250 dollar cameras and later tried the more expensive olympus in Best buy. The sony T300($ 369)was far more superior, the Carl zeiss lens is really distortion free. On the olympus there was a lot of distortion at the edges with blurring . On the canon the outdoor shots were fine and the indoor shots loooked good on the camera screen but were very pixely(grainy)when viewed on the computer.First of all the sony looks sexy ( I bought the red). I tried different settings and most work as predicted.Color representation is accurate. Macro auto feature is good. The smile maker, where it makes straightfaced subjects appear smiling was cool, the kids thought it was awesome. The sony does quite well indoors and there is a setting(easy) where you let the camera do the thinking which gave the best shots.I was doing indoor shots at dusk with very little natural light and candle light which turned out awesome.The touch screen is a cool feature and it works well(some early reviews said it was not sensitive and had to be presssed hard, I did not have that experience )although the menu asks you to confirm your choices way too many times. It however grows on you  Overall good camera, cons are- no viewfinder, works only with sony produo memory. This is a review from an amateur (however intelligent) , the tech gurus dissed this camera on cnet and other sites,please see their reviews for more technical data as to why they did not like it.
