Well, the camera arrived and was in good working order. I quickly learned that it's was no where near the quality of my other cameras, but thought that I would use it a few days to give it a chance. Well, I took it down as soon as a better replacement camera arrived and it's been sitting on the shelf in my garage ever since.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arrived DOA.", "Author": "David L. \"D\"", "ReviewID": "R3OXABBVASCWH2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Didn't work at all. The whole thing is plastic and never got to see the quality. I would not be surprised if it's a CMOS and not an actual CCD too.

I had a security co. install a system last year and I purchased the AG to replace one of theirs that somehow got moisture on the inside lens and actually to my surprise the AG picture is better, and at a fraction of the price of having them come back out or just purchase a similar camera. Granted theirs had a metal housing and slightly larger, but the bottom line is what the camera produces for the eyes to see, and at this point I'm seeing \"green\", in addition to a super picture. Now, It may self destruct tomorrow, but at this point, I am one happy 3.6mm camper.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped working (no picture) after 3 months", "Author": "Seera", "ReviewID": "R3NSO7INCU02EH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera has been in use for approx 3 months.  Has stopped working.  The encoder in the camera is still generating baseband video (my CCTV recorder \"detects\" it\"), but the video is completely black.  Can but assume that the imaging element has died.  Disappointing.Mitigating factor:  Until the camera died, it worked acceptably well...both day and night video were definitely usable (and definitely better than the \"included in the CCTV recorder bundle\" CCD cameras).  If it hadn't died, I would've continued to be satisfied with the product.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "GJC", "ReviewID": "R3LUCAYS3ULPOE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wasn't expecting much for $25.00, But I'm surprised!.
