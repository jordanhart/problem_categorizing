{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "C. Lanier", "ReviewID": "R31MZI9OVASD50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package is a great deal. Pricing separately, the body ($800) and the 18-140mm lens ($600) together are already hundreds of dollars more expensive than this entire bundle. The flash and battery are both off-brand, but considering they gave me 13 extra items, i honestly dont mind.  Pricing as a bundle($1100), for an extra $300, you get a second lens and 12 more items. The camera is amazing (my first DSLR).", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Wonderful Package!", "Author": "del92126", "ReviewID": "R10NBLNDVCBQDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my camera and accessories in a very well packaged large box. Everything that was listed arrived and a few things I ordered on the side came in. The camera is a fantastic photographic piece of equipment. I have had more fun with it, and the resolution is outstanding. I haven't used the flash accessory yet because the camera has a good one built-in to it.You won't be sorry that you purchased this package at all.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy !", "Author": "R.

It has what we needed as photographers looking to take the step past small or phone cameras. We're really enjoying the camera itself. Great features and picture quality. It can be the \"next step\" camera, with greater setting control, or a really big \"point and shoot\" camera if you like.  The Telephoto has a cool macro setting for extreme close ups.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "good kit for the price", "Author": "briand", "ReviewID": "R2R6HKB4NYE623", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a very good camera with two very good lenses everything in the kit seems to be decent quality except for the tripod it is very flimsy all and all well worth the money", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,249.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5300 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) + <2> Nikon 18-140mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Tamron 70-300mm Lens (Nikon) +\n<4> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <5> Spare EN-EL14 Battery + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <7> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card +\n<8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> 62mm UV Filter + <10> 67mm UV Filter + <11> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> Precision Design ML-L3 Remote + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <15> LCD Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D5300 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) with 18-140mm VR & 70-300mm Zoom Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Flash + Battery Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61FiixpB3QL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G5IPW4A"}}
