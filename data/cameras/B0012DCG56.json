It attaches easily, but securely, to notches located in the Alpha 200 body.  If this protector is damaged, it can easily be replaced.The only slight drawback, as to be expected, is another layer that adds reflections.  There are some multicoated, glass, third party screens that would work (they reduce the glare more), but cost double, and are a bit more difficult to remove (say, to get to a speck of dirt that has somehow gotten under it).For those with an Alpha 350, no, this protector does not work.Perfect?  No.  But it works well and is inexpensive.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Good", "Author": "M. George", "ReviewID": "RBZBEHMI42Q4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the things I worried about most with my new Sony Alpa 200 was keeping the LCD screen looking good.  As with any digital camera the screen is very easy to scratch (or worse) and although you do not use the screen to take pictues with this model, I want to keep it as nice as possible.I was thinking about getting one of those film protectors when I saw this one and ordered it.  I like it....it pops into place and fits perfectly, which it should since Sony made it for this camera, and is not obtrusive at all;  it does stick out just a little bit but does not get in the way, at least for me.Overall, I think that it is well worth 12 bucks to have the screen protected and if it gets scratched I can just pitch it and get another one, unlike the LCD screen on the camera!", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "I like the added safety", "Author": "Dr.Z", "ReviewID": "RSIKS3TF2AZOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item has been on my camera for several years.

I like it because it is permanent, not a disposable film cover and it is solid plastic so it will hold up pretty well.

Goff \"An open mind\"", "ReviewID": "R1GEBZIWP2Z7SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Within a week of buying my Sony A200 DSLR camera.... I had a small scratch on the LCD. Then I bought the Sony PCK-LH2AM. It came in the mail, I opened it up, read the instructions, simply attached it on and there it stays.  If it gets scratched or damaged I'll buy another one. Well worth the money.I too wish Sony would include it with the camera, how about a recommended suggestion even.  Not that the LCD is fragile or anything, it's going to get banged around with use. They don't make body armor for the A200 yet but if they do I will probably get that too.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expensive plastic but...a must", "Author": "Gary M.", "ReviewID": "RXF3550Z3KD4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These seem expensive for a piece of molded plastic but are a must to protect your camera's LCD.

Snaps into place really easy and doesn't look awkward.

Venugopal", "ReviewID": "RVAHPY5KQ357G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has got to be the product with the greatest profit margin to Sony. It is nothing but a rectangular piece of clear plastic with two notches that fit the Sony Alpha 200.You definitely need this, especially if you wear the camera strap around your neck. Without this, the LCD screen will rub against buttons/zippers, and will soon scratch. The actual product is great -- I mean how difficult can it be to make a rectangular piece of plastic?I think Sony should have included this with the camera at no additional cost. It probably cost them a dime to make, and they sell it for more than 100 times the cost.The frugal minded can try a different approach: if you already have PDA screen protectors, cut one to fit the LCD screen and save yourself the extra expense.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Custom fit your screen, but too costly", "Author": "P.
