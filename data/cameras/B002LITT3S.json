But I can tell you what I, as a rank amateur, like about it and why I chose it.I have grandkids. I needed a camera that would allow me to capture decent pictures of them - and in a digital format - so that I can, like all good grandparents, brag about my grandkids via email and attach photos to prove that they are the cutest kids on the face of the earth.I had my \"good\" camera - an old Pentax K1000 that I've had for about 30 years - and a small, inexpensive digital camera that I got a few years ago and have never been happy with. Not only was the Pentax not digital, it also turns out that the grandkids can move much faster than I can focus. And that camera purchased as my first attempt at digital just wasn't cutting it. It was overly complicated and with it I wasn't getting pictures good enough to share.I gave my needs some thought and made the following criteria list:Easy to use.Fast shutter speed.Easy to use.Small enough to fit into my purse easily.Easy to use.My needs were simple and I didn't think it would be too hard to find a camera to fit the bill. Happily, I was right.After my initial research had convinced me to go with a Canon, I borrowed my brother's Rebel (don't know the model number) and my son's Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS. I knew that neither fit my criteria (not to mention the $500-$700 price range was more than I wanted to spend), but using them for a few days gave me the opportunity to check out some of Canon's features.That's how I discovered the Optical Image Stabilizer. I can see from reviews of other cameras that it's been around for a few years, but I'd never used it before. It immediately went to the top of my list of desired features - even above \"easy to use\"!I have a tremor condition that causes fine shaking in my hands. It doesn't bother me and doesn't always affect close work, but it can make holding something steady - say, for instance, a camera - almost impossible. As you can guess, the result of that shakiness when snapping photos is, most often, crappy photos.Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer was like a miracle for me. With it, I could take close ups that were startlingly clear - not every time, of course, but MOST times. And, in combination with a fast shutter speed, the Image Stabilizer helped me to get some great shots - even action shots - of my test subject, my dog.With my adjusted criteria list, I did some more research that led me to the Canon PowerShot SX120IS 10MP. One of Canon's newer models, the PowerShot SX120IS puts ease of use in the forefront of its advertising. It fit all of my criteria and at a decent price.I haven't had this camera for very long, but I'm already thrilled with it. The Easy Mode is actually EASY! What a concept! The LCD screen is larger than what I've used previously and makes it easier for me to judge if the picture I just took is relatively clear. The Image Stabilizer continues to be my new best friend.Good points:IMAGE STABLIZER!!Fast shutter speedGenuinely easy to useSmall sizeDecent priceBad points:I'm so happy with my choice that I can't think of any right now!If I was a serious photographer, I may well have chosen a more comprehensive camera (with all those features and symbols only serious photographers can decipher). But for my level of use and my personal needs, this one does a terrific job and didn't overly strain the budget. Yeah!Recommended.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "(Maybe not) The one I've been looking for", "Author": "D Sing", "ReviewID": "R1BP0JAS1EJ8IO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been debating whether to get a point-and-shoot that is ok, or an SLR that is fantastic.  I couldn't justify spending mega$$$ on an SLR because I'm not that sophisticated a photographer.  But I have been unhappy with point-and-shoots that are so slow you miss the picture and that have only a \"mini-zoom\" feature.  But the Canon SX120IS solved it all.  First, it's a lot less expensive than an SLR.  And with the image stabilizer and a really fast shutter response time, I can catch the action before it's over!  It takes great close-ups, it has 10X optical zoom, and it has lots of other cool features I can't wait to learn how to use.  Plus the LCD screen is large and the controls are easy to use.  My only disappointment  is that it has no view finder and in some bright light conditions it is hard to see the screen.  But overall, I give it thumbs up!OK, now that I've used it a while, I have more comments.  First the good: I could get it from Amazon and it takes really fantastic pictures in difficult lighting conditions, (see my uploaded images.)  Then the not-so-good: it eats batteries, (which I think is true of any camera that uses regular batteries) and the lack of a viewfinder is a bigger pain than I thought.  Now  I'm reducing the rating and thinking I should have spent a little more and gotten the SX10IS or the newer SX20IS.  They have viewfinders, 20X zoom and all the good features i like on the SX120IS.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, though a bit noisy", "Author": "William Kerney", "ReviewID": "R2F70VZK019PT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My needs for a camera are as follows:1) It needs to fit in my pocket2) It needs to turn on quickly3) It needs to shoot \"decent enough\" photos on auto mode4) It needs to have enough options to tweak lighting settings.5) It should have both good indoor and outdoor performance.6) I'd like something that can do automatic exposure bracketing or otherwise support HDR photography.I've gone through various cameras over the years, and have borrowed some others to mess around with, and until last week was using a Canon A620, which was a surprisingly good camera, capable of taking shots as good as a DSLR, especially when tweaked correctly. It also could do automatic exposure bracketing for HDR photography when using the CHDK firmware for it. Then I accidentally left my A620 on a bench on South Beach when visiting last week, and so I suddenly found myself in the market for a new camera.I was seriously looking into the Fuji 200EXR and the Ricoh CX2 for the HDR photography mode, but they didn't have the tweakability settings I liked... the 200EXR was great except it always blew out the ISO levels to compensate for its limited image stabilization capabilities, which made auto mode shots almost always unacceptably grainy. I ended up settling on the SX120IS because it matches all my needs except for HDR photography. That, I'll hold off on until a new generation or two of HDR cameras has come and gone.It has very good low-light performance, as long as you're willing to put up with a certain amount of graininess Indoors, with the curtains drawn and just a couple normal lamps lighting the living room, it was able to take quite decent photos at ISO200. Without a flash. The IS was quite helpful in this regard, and the only downside was that the image had a noticeable level of noise in it. This will bother some people. Myself - I'm happy that it doesn't do what most P&S; cameras do, which is reduce the shutter speed to such a low level that everything blurs into nothingness. This is rather the opposite - quite crisp images with no blur, but you pay for it with a little bit of noise. I'm fine with that, really. I never carry a tripod, instead carrying it around in my pocket whenever I travel, and I like to be able to whip it out and photograph something on the spot, indoors or out.The camera turns on quite quickly, and the auto mode does a generally decent job for taking those quick shots that would otherwise pass you by (the bird posing on the branch). The camera also has a the right amount of manual settings for tweaking your shots just the way you want them. (Another poster on here complained it was too complicated for him, and I suppose that could be a fair criticism, but for me it's the right level of complexity.) Like with my other Canon, it allows you to tweak ISO, aperture priority, time priority, or all three, as well as something the A620 couldn't do - a manual focus setting, which has been quite fun to play around with.As far as all the vaunted features on this camera (auto face recognition, Digic 4, etc.), I didn't really notice it taking photos noticeably different from my A620. Image quality was about the same with the experimentation I did replicating several shots around the neighborhood. However, since I had no complaints about the A620, this is not a criticism. The one thing I do miss, though, is the flip out viewfinder. I much prefer a viewfinder that can flip around for self-portraits, or flip backwards to protect itself over the always-out LCD viewfinders which always get scratched up very quickly. But all of them are that way nowadays, so I am not really complaining that much about it.All in all, a great camera.Edit: After more experience with the camera (I've taken several thousand shots with this camera in different settings now), I have an update to this review.1) The SD card is very inconveniently located under the unwieldy battery door - I much prefer separate memory card doors on my cameras, so I can pop it out and into a computer easily.2) The smallish sensor size is not fully compensated for with the IS system. It has the noise of my previous camera at two ISO settings higher, and the auto mode tends to take shots in much higher ISO settings than needed, meaning you need to manually control the ISO mode most of the time, which is a minor annoyance.3) The zoom lens on this camera rocks. Much better than most P&S; camera zoom lenses. It makes a 100 yard shot look like it is 10 feet away, with no visible distortion or chromatic aberration. Macro shots also look very nice.4) At first I was annoyed by the wheel on the back of the camera, since it would tend to move when trying to push up or down, but it does make browsing through lots of old photos a snap.5) I've seen some people complaining about the fact that the SX120IS has a manual pop-up flash, whereas the higher level SX200IS model (which my father has, and I've used) automatically pops up the flash when you turn the camera on. However, believe me when I say that I greatly prefer the manual popup - it means you never take a flash photo when you don't want to. And flash sucks for a lot of shots since it wipes out depth in a photo and annoys people, like curators at museum. The camera knows the flash is disabled, and sets its properties accordingly. You can manually disable flash on other cameras, but if you set those cameras to auto mode, a lot of models will automatically re-enable the flash. With this camera, it'll never happen. I love it.6) I don't quite like the form factor on the camera. It seems easier to drop than other Canons that I've used.7) Being able to turn on auto-histograming and zebra highlighting over- and under-exposed parts of a photo on every shot out of the box is a very nice feature. I used to have to use CHDK to enable that on my older Canon.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "A very impressive camera for the price with some really stupid software...", "Author": "Hey Mo!!", "ReviewID": "R10Q8U9F36CZQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for the best zoom with image-stabilization in the under-$200 category and I'm pretty sure I've found it. In addition, I got what seems to be the smartest camera in its class. Unfortunately, the people who designed it were thinking more about getting the images onto the camera than getting the images off. It doesn't mount as a USB mass-storage device and the bundled software is total \"poo.\" It's a good camera, but save yourself a headache and get a card reader if you don't have one already.I paid about $20 less than Amazon's price for this camera, which put it in the same price range as a typical 3x-zoom pocket Panasonic, Pentax or Kodak camera, but IMHO it's better than any of those and way better than the Olympus cameras I've tried that cost more. Some of those other cameras will be 12-megapixels while this one's a \"mere\" 10MP, but don't buy into the megapixel myth.*_Pros:10x optical zoom for the price of a 3x zoom camera. The image-stabilization makes it a snap to get great pics while zoomed to the max.Picture quality is very nice. With decent lighting there's little noise, banding or color-shifting, even at the edges of the images where other cameras tend to sneak it in. Indoors, in Auto mode there's some fine noise in the red and green channels that's easily detectable, but about on-par with cameras in this price-range.The Auto setting gets you shooting high quality pictures in a hurry. About 2 seconds from power-on to the first shot.If, like me, you love to fiddle, this thing offers lots of manual settings. ISO, WB, manual focus, aperture control, custom exposure time up to 15 seconds... The Manual settings are especially useful for indoor and macro shots.People complain about the camera eating batteries. The cheap batteries that it came with were depleted before I'd finished reviewing the controls, but with Energizer Titaniums I easily got at least 250 shots -- some with flash -- before the batteries ran down. I haven't tried Lithium yet.The little battery used just for keeping time. Sometimes I leave my camera shelved for a month or two and with previous cameras I'd have to set the time and date and other presets all over again. This camera: No pain.Duplicating images and some tweaking including red-eye correction can done be while browsing images in Playback mode instead of at the time of the shot.The camera can be set to display detailed image data including a histogram when a picture is displayed at the time that it's shot and also later in the Preview mode.Pop-up flash with fine flash controls.Uses standard AA batteries. No proprietary charger to deal with.I honestly don't know that the auto face recognition does anything to improve my picture-taking, but it's fun to play with when you've got lots of people in a shot and the time to fuss around....*_Cons:While the manual says that the camera's memory card will mount on a Mac or PC using the supplied USB cable, I've found that it simply doesn't work and a little Googling confirmed that this is an epic fail for almost all Canon cameras. The camera is detected on the USB bus, but it's never mounted as a mass-storage device. I've got a card reader so it isn't a big deal, but it's annoying. Notably, if you lack a card-reader and if you've got a Mac, Apple's Image Capture software -- bundled with the OS -- detects the camera and lets you copy the images anywhere on your drive quite efficiently. This is in contrast to...The \"Camera Window\" software that Canon wants you to use to get images and movies off of the memory card is one of the most stupid inefficient pieces of crud ever to pollute my computer. It has almost no configurable options, shows thumbnails but doesn't allow a user to simply drag and drop images to the Desktop or to a convenient folder and forces the user to import the images into an awful awful awful proprietary image-catalog application. Whoever decided to push this lousy software on us deserves to be tarred and feathered and publicly flogged. I just want the memory card on my camera to mount on my computer so that I can copy my pictures to wherever the heck I want and decide for myself how I want my images cataloged. Almost every digital camera did that 10 years ago. Why is it so hard for modern camera-makers to do this?!!WB suffers a lot indoors when using the Auto mode without the flash.The camera's display tends to make images look brighter and more saturated than they actually are. Plan accordingly.Continuous shooting has a delay of about a second between shots. It should be faster.When shooting video, the WB and ISO seem to be stuck at whatever setting they are at when the camera starts recording so moving from a bright room to a darker room makes for color-shifts and noise.Also when shooting video, the optical zoom is stuck at whatever setting you had when you started recording. You can't zoom out from there and zooming in from that point is digital-only and adds noise....*_Nit-Picking:The plastic case makes it seem like this camera is low-end when it just ain't.The battery compartment can be hard to open. There should be some grooves in the battery-door to help you get the traction to slide the door out to the position where it swings open. I've found a trick to doing it with minimal effort: Move the little button with your fingernail, then keep your fingernail in the slot and push with the edge of your nail towards the side of the camera to slide the battery-door out to the point where it can swing open.Movies are shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio (640x480, AVI, MJPEG compression with raw 8-bit/11KHz mono audio). They are generally of excellent quality -- good enough to stand in for a camcorder in a pinch -- but modern devices should shoot in 16:9 instead of 4:3. Oddly, VLC reports encoding errors in the movie files, but QuickTime 7 has no problem with them.It's not really big or heavy, but this is not a camera that can easily fit in a pants-pocket. It does fit in the inside pocket on some of my coats. I actually went out and got a little camera case with a belt-loop and shoulder-strap for mine so I don't have to worry about it dangling from my wrist when I'm not using it.The big white wrist strap that mine came with is ugly. I replaced it with a svelte gray strap from another camera.The PhotoStitch software that it comes with crashes instantly under Mac OS 10.5 and 10.6. I didn't buy it for the cheezy software, but if you want to make panaramas be warned.The images are saved at 180dpi. I've noticed this with other Canon cameras. I can see a rationale for 72 dpi. I can see 96 or 244 or 300dpi. Why 180dpi? I know that it's arbitrary and largely meaningless, but that number is just weird.I wish this camera would save pictures in LZW TIFF or RAW format. I hate JPEG....Okay, so you've read this far and you see lots of criticisms. I still recommend this camera. It takes good pictures, it's got a great zoom with some of the best image-stabilization I've seen and the interface is suitable for both the neophyte and the advanced amateur user. It's a sweet camera and the price is fantastic for what you get. If you want better, you're going to end up paying a lot more.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the advanced photographer that's all about control", "Author": "RLSd", "ReviewID": "R3SGB1NR9UT6NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Sx120 is for the advanced photographer who wants more control than the typical digital camera, but without the extra bulk or price. I got this camera after having used the previous SX100 and Sx110 and some DSLRs. The main upgrade from the past is the DIGIC IV processor and the noise reduction at ISO 800 and 1600. In the previous SX models the noise was pretty bad, specks of odd color pixels were very obvious at high ISO, but with the SX120's new NR processing, it's a noticeable improvement. Granted it's not DSLR level, but very usable for a compact digital camera. All the other features are just minor tweaks from the previous models.This is a great camera for the money. It allows manual operation of aperture, shutter speed, even flash intensity (which comes in useful for optically triggering off-camera flashes). I wish more compact cameras allowed this kind of control for creative shooting. The aperture operation isn't like some other manufacturers that only have 2 settings, wide and small. It actually has increments in 1/3 stop steps which gives great control. One other feature you can't find in any other value compact digital camera is how fast the lens is. I mean how much light it lets in even when zoomed in (f2.8-f4.3). This allows faster shutter speeds to freeze the action in dimly lit areas. Most cameras have tiny lenses that lets even less light through when zoomed in, this makes the camera turn up the ISO (more noise), or slows the shutter speed (more blur). The Canon SX120 has a big enough lens to counter these effects. Even the new Canon SX200 has compromised in this area of the lens.Other nice features of this camera I like are being able to adjust contrast, saturation, and sharpness of images. I prefer to turn these down as much as possible to capture the most data at first, I can post-process the pictures later on a computer if I wanted (alternative when RAW isn't availble).This camera has so many great little things about it. I'll just list them here for completeness sake. It has great image quality, a lot of control for the user, intuitive interface, adequate performance speed for the category, uses convenient & greener AA batteries. I just have a few minor gripes that would make this an even better camera:1) Super-fine JPG mode is not available anymore, I wish the JPG compression was more adjustable.2) The Zoom level is not precisely displayed. I prefer an equivalent focal length display instead of an ambiguous zoom bar that only appears for a second or two when the zoom is activated.3) Flash recharge is slow, but it's to be expected since it uses AA batteries. This really isn't so bad since I don't use flash very much because the camera is able to take good photos in low-light with the big lens and good high ISO performance along with the optical image stabilizer. I get good performance out of the camera using slow-discharge NiMH batteries (don't get the high mAH rating ones, they have a high self-discharge rate).4) There's no way to turn off the auto-lens retraction when playing back images, which resets the settings when I turn the camera back on to shoot again (I have to readjust my zoom level and exposure compensation settings for example.)5) Wide-angle isn't very wide at 36mm EFL, I prefer a bit wider and give up some in the telephoto end, while keeping the same lens performance.6) Video recording is ok (640x480 in mJPEG), optical zoom disabled while recording. I dont' take a lot of videos and figured this camera is really for taking creative still photos. So it's an ok compromise for me.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for the all purpose", "Author": "V. Jain", "ReviewID": "RGRQTNANJ85RH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a beginner and I got suddenly interest in taking great pictures. So I was looking for a camera that has high zoom, manual controls as well as auto controls. When I started searching for good camera reviews I shortlisted 4- 5 cameras that included canon sd1100,sd770, Sony DSC H20 and canon sx100 is. The first two were point and shoot and had all functionality that I was looking for other then some manual, but less optical zoom. Sony and canon both were good but I chose to go for canon as it has lots of shooting options.I was looking to buy sx110is (sx100is 's successor) and then I got a news that sx120is is released. I was not sure whether to take the older one or get the new one who has not been rated. But I bought this and I am happy with it. It is not that much heavier then other cameras with good optical zoom. though comparing to Panasonic's lumix, it is heavier.It has great functionality such as:*Easy to use. if you just want to say with auto selection then that also gives you best pictures.*face detection, that is very useful while taking self picture. Detects up to 9 face at a time.* continuous shooting , like taking 3 pictures simultaneously at fast speed.* iso 3200* 10x optical zoom, 40x digital zoom.* 15 shooting mode* sunset,sun rise detection,* Great functionality in video shooting like zoom out, zoom in.* manual controls,you can set shutter speed, Av, Tv mode.* Image stabilizer.* Big LCD screen in which display picture rotates according to holders direction i.e while displaying pictures, if you are holding camera horizontal it sets picture automatically horizontal.* We can focus picture first and then can take pictures.the only thing is that it doesn't have a viewfinder. some people might not like it but it doesn't matter for me as far as I can see what I am taking , what is in focus through LCD. Also it requires AA battery that has its own plus and minus point, but it requires only 2 AA batteries and can take 200 to 300 snaps.That is good enough.The flash is not automatic. you have to fire it manually,it has its plus minus too.Too much auto pop of flash might frustrate some one, or some might want auto flash, but camera detects and let you know that this picture requires flash so you can raise the flash, not bad!!It can fit in pocket so not bad then any other point and shoot.I took some pictures from it while I was learning its functionality. I took some on low resolutions. That can not give justice to camera, later I got some great pictures by learning some mode.

Well it's biggest problem is picture quality. I rarely got an image that wasn't soft, no matter what I tried. Also, the focus square would most always not select the main subject. When I chose the select faces option, only one or two faces would be chosen and often those in the background rather than the nearest subject. There also wasn't a multi-point focusing. Only one green square box would come up. Regarding camera build, it is built well and feels sturdy. The pictures just were always soft and slightly out of focus. Also, indoor photos had a yellow cast to them when I got them printed at Kodak site. Lastly, you must realize before buying this that you will wait a full FIVE seconds between shots when using the flash. That is an eternity folks! At my Christmas party with all the kids posing with Santa, I was the one they were waiting for the camera to recharge, while my sister-in-law with the Sony point and shoot and cousin with the Nikon were shooting away. Often after a flash shot, when the camera screen appeared so I could shoot again, the flash would not go off, so I ended up with an underexposed (and blurry) picture. Oh, and forget about the high ISO options (which is another reason I bought it). I attempted to take shots in a gymnasium of my son wrestling. Exposure wise they came out well, just that they were blurry and NOISY. For these reasons I'm going to get either the Kodak Z915 or the Z950 and return this. In summary, I can't believe how highly this is rated for how badly it produces photos.Update: I bought the Kodak z915 and absolutely love it. Pictures are sharp (albeit I learned for large groups of people us the landscape button for best sharpness). It also has an incredible \"stage\" scene mode that allows you to take pictures of people on stage and no flash or camera sounds go off and pictures come out great! Also, it has a \"high ISO\" scene that allows incredible indoor shots, which I took at a Rutgers basketball game from row 20 off the floor. Lastly, has a completely manual option, where you can play and learn with iso, aperture, shutter speed and exposure. Unbelievable camera conveniently powered with double A batteries.

I love the powershot S series ultra-zoom cameras, but now I want a smaller camera. But keep in mind, in this case, smaller the size, fewer the features. So this review is directed to S-series users that look for ultra-zoom portability.First the good:- Good image quality, IMHO. As I am not a professional, just an enthusiast, my amateur eyes tell me that the quality is almost the same of my previous S5, maybe a little more noisy.- AA batteries: For me it is a must!- Good battery life: Not as good as S series, as it uses only 2 AA, but It lasts two days of heavy using. in my last vacation, I took more than 1000 pictures, lots with flash, and changed the batteries maybe 4 times at most - Sony Cycle Energy 2000 mAh.- Good optical image stabilization: same performance as S-series- Manual control over shutter/apperture/ISO. A must!- I-contrast: I realy think it works! The dark areas with bright background photos are better than the ones with S5.- Automatic lens cover: No more manually covering the lens like on S-series.Now the bad:- No color accent!!!! Why Canon? As it is a software feature, why strip this useful feature (I think) from this camera? I loved it on my S5 and now it is gone. (Ok, I could do it with photoshop...)- No color swap too - I did not use this one very much, so no big deal for me.- No stich assist!!!!! Why again, Canon? No space left on the function dial? No space for more Digic4 code? :(- No optical zoom with video... I am not a camera engineer, but it looks like a very difficult feature to fit on smaller cameras. As a user, I think: move the zoom lens, keep focusing and evaluating exposure - No big deal. It does not seem to be difficult, but, it may be, as a lot of pocket cameras lacks this feature. Sx120 has only digital zoom while recording videos (I hate the output quality of digital zoom), so I do not use it. For the record, you can use the optical zoom before starting the video recording, but it gets locked on this position until the video recording stops.- No HD video: For me, it is no big deal, I like the 640x480 quality.Bottom line: S-series users, it is a good camera, but I do not know why some good software features were stripped. I have accepted that it is the price for portability (it can fit on a large pocket), but as soon as a new AA-battery, compact, ultra zoom model with the SX120 lacking features comes around, I will sell this camera.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for Amatuer and Advavced users.

But in the Creative modes of \"Apeture and \"Shutter Priority\" you can do Professional work. The Nickel Hydride \"AA\" batteries and their large capacity, work very well in this Camera.

NY", "ReviewID": "RVZVPN99YP3BV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would like to start off by saying that I am not a very advanced photographer but I wanted to get a camera that offered more than what the compact point and shoots have to offer.  The main feature about this camera (aside from the Canon name which I prefer) is the great optical zoom.  I go to alot of sporting events and this camera is great for zooming in and getting clear shots of the action.  I am usually sitting relatively far away in the stands but the zoom makes me feel right there. It also has alot of features that you can select from for a particular setting (ie sunset) or you can manually adjust the setting and focus to your liking.  I think this is a good feature because right now I am not advanced and generally use the preset selections but if I learn more about photography I can still use this camera to make my own modifications.  I like the fact that it takes AA batteries because if you run out of battery life, its easy to replace them on the go.  One thing I want to point out, although not a major problem, is that the battery compartment is a bit hard to open.  The picture quality is great and what I have come to expect from Canon.  Overall, if you are looking for a moderatley small camera that offers the casual photographer great photo quality and gives you a great zoom with some extra features, this is the camera for you.  Some people on here that rate cameras expect too much out of their point and shoot....its not an SLR so the photos in all situations are not perfect, but for its class it does a fine job.

Just when I thought I got the right camera - it turns out to be not much of an upgrade at all.My Canon A640 is about 3 years old and I wanted to replace with a camera that has an Image Stabilizer. Canon SX110 IS and this model seemed to be likely choices. Although the SX110 seems to be sold out everywhere except for Ebay. I actually bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5A 9.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue) and did some image tests - the tests did not come out the way that I'd liked, Canon had better image quality for sure.So I ended up buying this camera upon the return of the Panasonic. I took pictures with the A640 and SX120 cameras side-by-side. Then saved files into my computer and saw them on the screen blown up 100%. Taken at the same lighting, same angle, same ISO, etc. My Canon A640 took more vivid pictures than the SX120. However, the SX120 did take some clearer pictures. When both cameras were in Auto mode. The IS almost didn't matter in low-light situations. The quality of images were almost similar - blurry without a tripod. This leads me to think that this whole \"Image Stabilization\" was just a marketing technique to sell more cameras with the same technology. Granted, the sx120 did take better videos. With IS, the videos did not shake as much. However, I determined that photo quality was my main reason for getting and switching cameras. The photo quality in the SX120 seemed to be lower, less vivid, yet the pixels were higher, this seems to be because the \"superfine\" setting in manual mode was done away with (as someone else had previously mentioned). I found it funny that the files taken without the \"superfine\" feature were smaller, yet the photo was larger.The moral of the story is that if you already have a Canon that has great image quality, then the SX120 isn't worth it, it's not an upgrade by any means, more like a waste of [...] bucks.However, if you were a first time Canon customer, I would HIGHLY recommend this camera, as I have done image comparisons with the Sony DSC-H10 and the Panasonic DMC-TZ5A, and neither can beat the Canon in photo quality.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera light weight camera", "Author": "RTR", "ReviewID": "R37YYEFKTIGU7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera last month specifically to take on a 2 week vacation in Europe.  I wanted a light weight digital that I could easily lug around London and Paris instead of a heavy SLR.  I took nearly 1000 images over those two weeks in bright sun, at the 'magic hour', in museums, in dimly lit cathedrals, from moving buses, at night, free holding the camera and on a monopod, and in most other conditions.The camera performed very nicely and the image quality is excellent.  I purchased this camera because it has a Manual operation mode: you use a little wheel at the back of the camera to adjust the Shutter speed, and F-stop.  The LCD display (there is no optical view finder) displays the lightness and darkness of the image as you adjust the settings.  Overall this operation was easier than on my old Canon Rebel XT SLR.  Post shot the image also displays the ever useful brightness histogram and 'blinkies' for over-exposed areas.  The camera also has a built in image stablization system that kicks in when the shutter speeed is too slow.Pros: Excellent images quality, good color and contrast, lots of megapixels to work with.  I got great pictures in good light and it worked well in low light with the ISO pushed to 400 or 800.  The image stablization worked well enough for me to get some decent shots of the Eiffel Tower at night from a tour boat, which I didn't expect.  It has a long zoom range and the image quality at max zoom is decent. The camera is lightweight and easily fits in a coat pocket.  Controls are all easy to reach even with my big hands.  The delayed timer is easy to set.  Image playback is good and the LCD is big.Cons: The camera would chew up a pair of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries in about 50 shots.  I never did figure out how to turn off the LCD between pictures without turning off the whole camera; it does power off itself after 60 seconds.  Charging the built in flash is pretty slow.  Two pair (4) of rechargeable batteries normally got me through the day but I always had a set of Lithium AA as a backup.  And if you put on a tripod adapter plate, it will probably cover the battery compartment meaning you have to take that off to change the battery. The camera has lots of other functions but there is no detailed paper manual in the box - only a small one to cover the basics and a CD with hundreds of more pages.  So there are still a lot of features that I haven't figured out, like how to manually activate/deactivate the image stabilization.  The max F-stop seems to be F8.0 and min shutter speed is 1/2000 of second.  Of course there is nowhere near as much optical glass as an SLR and no optical view finder.Overall: The camera won't replace my SLR but it will definitely be a great supplement for the times I don't want to carry the extra weight.  It puts a 10 megapixel camera with good optics and lots of manual control in the palm of your hand.

Good pics are lens and lighting moreso than megapixel count.I've seen a lot of negatives with \"low light\" and it's fair to complain, but a good picture requires the right lighting.  I've found that the SX120 takes good low-light pictures where there is enough light for part of your subject.  I took a picture of several people doing Rock Band in a room with lots of track lighting and a mirrored ceiling.  The focal point looks great but the lesser lit guitarist was a bit blurred.  I took a second shot with flash and it's much sharper, but the flash changes the look with background glare from the mirrored ceiling.  Lighting matters!I had originally bought a Samsung TL220, falling for the glam of touchscreen, dual screens (front and back) and all that stuff.  I took it back because the picture quality (low light or not) simply was substandard for a $280 camera.  I found the SX120 by chance at Target on sale for $199.The SX120 takes great pictures for a point and shoot (keep that in mind!).  It also has all the important features of the more expensive point and shoots (I like that it has 16:9 wide angle).  But for the shutterbug that wants more, you can control shutter and aperture like a DSLR.  You also control the flash, since you have to manually flip it up.  Believe it or not, that's a great feature because I don't always remember to menu around to turn off the flash.It is not as slim as the newest models but it is small enough for a shirt/coat pocket (albeit bulky looking in the pocket).Keeping this from 5 stars is battery life and flash recycle.  The two AA batteries that came with the camera lasted long enough for test shots and one Christmas party with sparse use.  You will always need batteries on hand for this camera.  The flash also takes a painful 4 to 5 seconds to regenerate... that is unacceptably slow when you need it under most circumstances.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic piece of equipment!", "Author": "Ryanst", "ReviewID": "R1IVS20XWFEGHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Truly a great camera! As far as point and shoots go, this is about as good as you're going to get for the sub $200 price range. The camera is built solid with a nice heft to it. It doesn't feel like something you'll be replacing every year or two. Pictures in 10MP/FINE mode turn out excellent. There are no noticeable defects when viewed full screen. Zoom in, and you will start to see minor chromatic aberration around the edges of objects in high contrast, but aside from that colors are sharp, and accurate. Exposure and white balance are usually set correctly using auto or programmed AE modes. Unless you plan on making large prints, the quality of the photos is near professional quality. Battery life is a little short with alkalines, but reasonable using NIMH rechargeables (about 350 shots). Given the wide availability of AA batteries, battery life is not an issue for me. I just swap them out and go! In my experience, I prefer this setup over lithium battery packs, which degrade over time naturally, and the proprietary nature of them which puts you at the mercy of the camera company for replacement batteries. Not to mention if your battery runs out and you don't have a replacement pack, you won't be taking pictures!Now for the caveat (minor though). Low light shots are usually noisy. The sensor does not do a fantastic job capturing smooth, rich photos in low light areas. There is an increased ISO mode up to 3200 to help increase light sensitivity, but taking pictures in this setting should be strictly used for utilitarian purposes only as the quality is very poor (but usable). Using an ISO above 400 will bring in some noise to your pictures. The quality is good up until that, but after ISO400, the quality drops of dramatically. Try to use ISO 80-200 most of the time.All things considered, this camera has made me very satisfied! The quality is exceptional for daylight photos, and good/adequate for night photos.

I wanted a camera that took better pictures than the CoolPix; better zoom, image stabilization, low light capabilities, etc. Essentially, more big camera features in a little package. But still within the category of a \"pocket\" camera.I also wanted a camera that operated entirely from off the shelf AA batteries. When I go on trips, I do NOT want to lug a battery charger with me, OR have to pay ridiculous prices for proprietary rechargeable batteries specific to particular vendors OR have to carry a spare with me so I can keep shooting when the vendor proprietary battery expires, which is usually at the worst possible moment. Just put off the shelf AA batteries in which you can get ANYWHERE and keep shooting. Simple. It also gets around the \"planned obsolescence\" concept that camera vendors use to force you to buy a new camera every few years by discontinuing the proprietary batteries for older models under the justification of \"beyond end-of-life\".I spent HOURS searching and finally came up with this Canon. Bought it when it was $199.00. Have used it several times in the last six months and I am STILL on the original set of alkaline AA's I put in it. Okay, I don't use the flash much.

Battery life is very good (so far)4.) Nice form factorBad points (actually, more like annoyances):1.) It is a bit too large to be used as a \"pocket camera\". A large pocket maybe. I have to work to wedge it in and out of my jacket pocket. No big deal.2.) They put the SD card under the battery door. Extremely annoying to have to open the battery door to get to the SD card. I transfer pics to my computer directly from the SD card and NEVER use the USB cable (it's just another thing to have to keep track of). Good news is the battery door is made of metal; at least it is not likely to break from the stress of being opened/closed continuously while accessing the SD card.

The camera is rated as 10X but with two extra megapixels, it will actually go up to 40x is you are willing to settle for a .jpg that we had in  2002 (a tripod is a must). The color seems somewhat better--the A570 seemed to be a little \"cooler\". The only negatives--quibbles actually--is the lack of an optical viewfinder which was probably sacrificed to make room for the larger lens and the lack of a panorama mode which I never used and is readily available with shareware. I did like the flip-up flash which is gives more light than the one on the A570. One thing you definitely will need is a larger SD chip to hold the larger pictures, the one that came with the camera is only 128mB (the A570 came with a tiny 16mB SD.)

For some indoor shots, the warm colors of incandescent lighting might be even considered a plus.Fast, shutter lag in non-existent once the exposure and focus are set - makes it much easier to capture those split-second moments. Once you realize how the auto-focus operates, it's easy to have the camera focused properly in no time.Slow synchro flash option, and 3 levels of flash output in manual mode - that way you can avoid the over/under exposure situations caused by the flash. Being able to use the flash as a fill-in to compensate for a backlit subject, while avoiding overexposing a very interesting background is a big plus.Fully manual controls.Good choice of semi-automatic controls.Optical image stabilization - and it works, too!! I was able to take a picture of a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter, hand-held, at max zoom, with the helicopter being about 2 miles away - and I still had enough resolution in the picture to be able to count the blades on the rotors.AA batteries - try buying a proprietary Li-Ion or charger at a gas station. Ni-MH rechargeables are cheap and easy to find, and if you can't keep those charged and ready to go, you won't do any better with a proprietary battery.

Not a lot, though - I've seen much worse. Did some experimenting with some infrared LEDs, and got the same effect and color - so I'm starting to believe some of the purple fringes are caused by infrared light hitting the sensor, slightly off focus due do the higher wavelength. I'm still looking for an infrared blocking filter to test this theory in full.No optical zoom during movie recording - only digital.No 3:2 picture aspect ratio - only 4:3 and 16:9No automatic exposure bracketing mode - it can be done manually, without too much hassle.Could benefit from longer exposure times, and smaller apertures - but the available selection covers about 95% of the situations that you would encounter in day to day photography. A software hack developed by a group of enthusiasts, called CHDK, is in the process of being ported to the SX120 - it will provide, among other things, exposures up to 64 seconds, the ability to take RAW pictures, battery voltage, live histogram and optical zoom during movie recording.Overall, after using it for 6 months and taking more than 2000 pictures, I would give it 4.5 stars - it's not perfect, but for this price, you can't beat it.EDIT: After more than a year and 6000 shots, still going strong, with no complaints. Had a chance to take a look at the SX130is, it's successor, and I was not impressed. The SX120 has a higher actual zoom (36 to 360 mm versus  28 to 336 mm on the SX130 - the SX130 gives you a wider angle for close-up shots, as a benefit) and a better image quality (the SX130 lens is slower - that means, it lets less light through it, with a minimum aperture setting of F/3.4-5.6, versus F/2.8-4.3 on the SX120). If you don't need HD movie recording capability or optical zoom wile shooting video (although the SX120 with the CHDK software can do it, with the minor inconvenience of hearing the zoom motor in the movie file), stick with the SX120 while you can still buy it.By the way, check the amazing lighting strike photo I captured with the camera and the CHDK software.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Amateurs", "Author": "AmatuerPhotographer", "ReviewID": "R2GY57XRBBZPD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a digital camera for Christmas and received this in 2009.

It's easy to use, gives you several options and the ability to edit settings, has a nice wrist-strap to prevent you from dropping the camera, and is very easy to carry around. I would strongly recommend upgrading to a better memory card. The one that comes with the camera can't hold that many pictures.

I wanted a pocket size, high quality camera with professional operating modes like, shutter priority, aperture priority, spot focusing, exposure selections, and even manual focus.  I also wanted a camera that wouldn't hopelessly flash without my permission and the pop-up flash solves this problem nicely.But I wasn't prepared for the big surprise - it actually takes good quality pictures I couldn't get with my bulky profession camera!  The 2.8 lens is fairly fast, but combined with the image stabilization and relatively low noise ISO options up to 1600, I can take pictures never before possible in low light conditions.  And, the shutter lag (or lack thereof) is also amazing at only .06 seconds for pre-focused shots, allowing stop action of moving objects.Unfortunately, it appears that the SX120-IS may be nearing the end of its lifetime and I don't see anything to replace it near its current price. This camera is a steal at $179.

I was looking for something that was simple to use, had a lot of zoom, had good-to-excellent picture quality, was for everyday use (i.e., I'm clumsy, so I didn't want it to break the first time I touched it), and was in the $100-200 range. I also wanted a camera that was nice enough and had the technology to last several years.  Basically, for what I was wanting, I narrowed it down to three cameras:  the Kodak Z915, the Canon SX120IS, and the Panasonic Lumix ZS3.  The Panasonic had a wide-angle lens, which I was very interested in but which wasn't necessary, while the Kodak camera was (at the time of purchase) about $50 cheaper than the Canon.  I decided I wanted something a bit more sturdy than the ZS3 and with better photo quality than the Kodak, so I decided to give this camera a try.As other reviewers have said, this camera has some good and bad to it.  I've been playing with it for four months now, and I love it sometimes and hate it others.  That said, the good things include:--excellent photo quality (by my standards and for its class)--versatility (the camera has settings for foliage, aquariums, snow, different indoor lighting, and a sunset filter)--the opportunity to have more control over IS, exposure, focus, etc., than a basic point-and-shoot--sturdy design.  Because it's a bit larger than other cameras, it can't fit into a pocket, but it is also not going to fall out of my hands from strong winds or clumsiness.--The ability to take multiple shots is nice (I know other cameras do this, but it's the first time I've had the ability to play with it).  This camera will take 3 shots at about 1 second per shot and will refocus on the subject between shots.--The flash is manually popped up when you want to use it so it doesn't accidentally go off when you don't want it to.  You can also take pretty good pictures in most lighting without the flash.--The camera takes AA's, so if you run out of batteries in the middle of a trip or away from a plug-in, you can just buy replacements.Some of the bad things I've found:--If you want a good shot, you have to make *everything* hold still.  My little brother shows cattle, and 6 out of every 10 pictures will be blurry if taken when the calf is walking around the ring.  Once things are held still, though, the photos look very nice.-- The auto-focus and image stabilization don't always work as planned.  Sometimes I will center something and try to take a picture of it, only to find that the camera was focused on something behind it (this may be due to impatience in taking the picture).--It takes about 5-10 seconds after you use the flash for you to be able to take another picture.  I usually fix this by taking a shot with flash first and then closing the flash so that I get a faster turnaround.Also, I've been through 3 pairs of AA's since I bought the camera and have taken hundreds of pictures and used several hours of playback, so I would say that that is fairly decent battery life.  However, I also take the 'dead' batteries out and they function in my tv remote, so the camera doesn't actually use all of the juice in the batteries, it just takes a lot of power to run.Overall, I really like this camera despite my inability to get it to take good shots of fast-moving objects.

I had a 200 dollar limit and only went by reading hundreds of reviews (cnet, google & amazon), never actually having an opportunity to try out a camera hands on.  It was the lowest rated of the last three cameras I was looking at, but in the end, after a month of searching, I finally decided the sx120is was the best choice.  It was durable and sophisticated looking, complete with a 3\" LCD and had near flawless reviews.  There wasn't a whole lot of negative feedback on this camera, all of what I read pretty much said the same and what I got was expected.  Needless to say, that wasn't much.  My only major complaint is battery life.  On average, my rechargables last about 30 minutes.  Fortunately it only requires 2 AA batteries so I'm able to charge the other two while I used the first two on taking pictures.  Still, even with the rechargables switching out, 40 minutes to an hour isn't a lot of time when you're doing heavy photography like a vacation or something.  The manual that came with the camera tells you nothing.  All the information on manual settings is on the cd, which kinda stinks.  Although a bit frustrating, I'm a guy and find instructions more time consuming that figuring things out on my own.  I discovered using program mode with the florescent H light setting and vivid color gave beautiful shots with no flash in low light producing very little grain.  I even went as far as to take pictures with ALL of the lights out in my room and only the shades open letting city lights shine through.  I couldn't believe how well pictures came out in near total darkness.  My face was still very visible in front of the dark red 3am sky behind me.  A little grain but expected and not anything that couldn't be fixed with a little photoshop magic.  I had the most fun taking close ups.  I got some amazing detail that I didn't even know cameras that cheap were capable of producing.  There's a sunset mode, if you've been reading reviews I'm sure you've heard about it.  Although the intent is for sunsets, I don't think it's a good setting as the natural colors of the sunset are filtered, though it IS wonderful for ugly colored automatic situations, instantly turning white light to a dim `italian style' lighting.  For my pale skin I found it especially useful not bringing out all of my blemishes.  I didn't remember reading anything in the reviews about it, but the camera has a sensor in it so the images turn to face you when you turn the camera.  There is only a very small (128mB) SD card included, though to my surprise, that still holds approximately 100 high quality pictures.  Most of the pictures I took were a quarter of the highest quality and still far bigger than I needed.  A new card, if that is the issue, is gonna be an expense with any camera, and a 4gB Sd card can be purchased for as little as a dollar on ebay, $10 on average.  Considering it doesn't fall apart and have issues (which there is a warranty I sent in) I'd give this a 4.8 out of 5.

Picture quality is fantastic.  I have a 2 and 4 year old, this camera does very well capturing pics of them, especially in kids and pet mode and does not sacrifice quality due to the fast shutter.  The flash is a manual pop up, which we have learned can be a benefit, this camera does very well with no flash as long as the subject is relatively still.  In fact even when the flash is up it will not use it when most cameras would (on auto) and yields very nice photos, as long as the subject is relatively still.  There are quite a few manual features that allow you to get very nice pics in low light situations without a flash as well, it just takes some playing around to figure it out, the instruction manual is not the best.  However if you are inclined to putz around you can figure out most of the features pretty easily.  As a comparison, we have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 and have always been relatively dissapointed with the picture quality as it tends to blur fairly easily and the suject gets sort of a halo effect if there's too much contast as well as an issue with white balance.  This camera beats the Panny in all areas except portability and weight.  It's slightly bigger than most point and shoots but the zoom quality is very good when compared to smaller compact cameras and the features and manual settings are better as well.Software that comes with this is not very good, but I use Photoshop Elements (excellent) anyway.Regular alkaline batteries get eaten up in a hurry with this camera, however we purchased some Sanyo Eneloops (8 AA's and 4 AAA's, with charger) from Amazon and it now shoots photos longer than any camera I've owned that has a lithium rechargable batter system.

The camera also lacks HD movie capturing abilities. That said, if you're not looking for a video camera, this camera should do you well.Image stabilization works well, but at full zoom it will not do everything for you. There is slight barrel distortion (bulging), but noise levels are great up to ISO 400 and the picture is not completely terrible at ISO 1600 (highest sensitivity, unless you go under ISO 3200 mode). Unlike many other cameras, exposure with the flash is generally great. Manual controls abound and are easy to use. In bright sunlight, the LCD becomes nearly impossible to see, but I can usually take a picture based on the outlines that are visible in the screen. The camera does go through batteries--the ones that came with the camera were dead after two days of shooting (not constant, but frequent).

It's on their site.  ****  Canon SX130is has 720p HD video with VARIABLE ZOOM  ****This is my secondary camera and I am very pleased with how it performs. My primary camera is the Canon SX20is which shares a few features that this one has as well as some that are just better. The menu layout is nearly the same so the learning curve between the two is easy. The decision to get this as a secondary unit was based on these similarities as well as my familiarity with Canon.This is not really a pocket camera. At least for a pant pocket for most users, but it will fit easily into a jacket pocket or purse just fine. It's not in the same class as a full size DSLR either, so comparisons with such really isn't a fair game. But it can take some really nice pictures for the camera it is. I've posted some pictures to illustrate differences in zoom power, macro focus and picture detail. Just look for the the alligator pond, cluster of blooms and the standing helicopter. Further over in the samples is shots of a bird house in my back yard taken just as the sun was setting to illustrate a lower amount of light. And there's a picture of the pool at night with the flash to illustrate how powerful it is. They were all taken in hand held standing positions, in auto mode and no cropping was used. Some zoom comparisons are true to full frame.I really like the performance of the camera and have had very little disappointment in it. It does so well in fact, when using it, I've yet to wish that I had my primary camera instead. It seems the most common disappointment in other reviews is the lack of a view finder. This is true, but I believe that having an electronic one would have not only raised the price but the size of the camera itself. And personally, I've never taken a better aligned shot with a cheap optical \"pass thru\" view finder than that with a rear screen.I've had some great results with auto mode shots. All the samples I've posted were taken in auto. But the camera also has manual control settings as well to take even better shots and be creative as well. In a sense, you have the best of both worlds in picture taking. Several pocket cameras don't have this option.The large lens opening makes this camera appealing too. It allows for a greater amount of light to come into the camera for a better pictures. Several pocket cameras have much smaller lens openings.The zoom ring surrounds the shutter button so composing the shot and taking the picture are right there together in very little motion.If you want a camera to take rapid shots, you'll have to pay somewhat more for such a unit, but this unit won't be determining the winner of any horse races so to speak.But this is a pretty smart camera. It can determine what kind of shot you are taking and set itself for the best effect needed. And you always have the option to program the effect you want as well. The menu is very easy to follow in it's layout, especially due to the control wheel on the back. This also makes for great control for viewing pictures you've taken already.Having the combination of 10x power optical zoom and 10MP resolution is somewhat rare in this class of camera. Several other units usually have one or the other, but rarely both in the same unit. There are some out there though but they usually cost more.One of the appealing aspects of this camera is the fact that it uses standard AA batteries. Several critics disagree for various reasons. It's true that regular alkaline cells might be disappointing in this camera. That's because this unit has a large screen, 3 inches in fact. But this makes for a great view of what your are taking photos of. But I've discovered some large capacity batteries that last a long time in both of my cameras. Nickle Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries will do very well in digital cameras. High capacity ones do even better. Flashes recharge a bit faster with them as well. And buying an extra set for back up won't break the bank. Plus I don't see AA's being discontinued anytime soon, so as long as your camera is in working order, you'll be able to get replacements to continue using it. And if by chance you've taken so many pictures and run out, your fail safe alkaline cells can be found nearly everywhere in the world in common stores at good prices. You'll never miss a picture of life time due to a dead battery.The batteries I spoke of are Ansmann 2850 mAh capacity cells. The higher this number is the longer it will last. In the review sites for such batteries, these and Eneloop brand rate very high in how well they hold their charge. Several commonly found cells don't truly hold up to their labeled ratings. But these two brands do.The full manual does not come in the box, but it is down loadable on Canon's site and it can be found on the included CD. So you can read the manual before deciding to buy the camera if need be. I printed mine out in booklet form, double sided of course, and took it to a local office supply store to have it spiral bound with plastic covers front and back. Now I have the full book in hand. It only cost me $4.The camera does have video capability but only in VGA resolution. And the zoom is not adjustable while video is in operation, only the digital zoom. But you can pre-zoom your image before starting the video. But IMHO, having HD and variable zoom would have added to the cost.I recommend getting the batteries I mentioned, a class 4 (speed) 8GB SD card or better/higher and you'll get a little faster flash recharge rate and quicker times between shots. The \"busy\" indicator after taking a shot with mine lasts only about a second. Also format the SD card on initial (first time) use.Please check out the photo samples I mentioned above and let those speak for themselves on what the camera can do. There are several video test shots on Youtube posted by several users, so check those out to see the quality. I think you'll be pleased even though it's VGA. (But if you use the digital zoom, it'll become grainy.) And there are some camera review videos as well that tell lots about the camera.Read the manual and you'll discover that you have a pretty powerful and flexible camera.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera - more than worth the price!", "Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "R17DSNK8TWFI1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 17 year old son to take on a three week trip to South Africa for FIFA World Cup soccer.

Color, contrast, and white balance are accurate.  Exposure metering is also accurate.  There is some highlight clipping, but that is common to just about every point and shoot.  Pictures are fairly clean when shot at ISO 400 and below, it gets noisy at higher ISOs.The 10x zoom provides an impressive range of focal lengths, although I wish it went wider than 36mm (35mm equivalent).  The center area is sharp, but it gets soft in the corners, especially at the wider focals.  Unfortunately CA (purple fringing) is significant in high contrast areas, but this can be corrected during post processing.  The lens stays surprisingly sharp at the longer focal lengths and the IS feature works well.The camera offers some impressive exposure modes for a point and shoot.  Manual, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Programmed mode are all great.  These four modes allow a great deal of creativity.  The Smart Auto modes are REALLY bad, just like all of the recent Powershots.  When shooting indoor flash in one of the two Smart Auto modes the camera will commonly select a very low shutter speed, which will result in a blurry shot due to camera shake.  Smart Auto mode will also constantly hunt for a special scene mode and it will boost the ISO higher than is really necessary.  The results will be very unpredictable and generally poor.  The various scene modes are also fairly useless.  For best results in an \"Auto\" mode switch to \"P\" mode, turn on auto ISO, auto flash, evaluative meter, large file size, fine quality, auto white balance, photo effects off, and IS on continuous.  The results will be more consistent and predictable than a Smart Auto mode and more importantly the shutter speed when shooting indoor flash will never drop below 1/60.  The 1/60 shutter will get you sharper flash shots than the slower shutter speeds the Smart Auto modes allow.I get about 300 pictures on a set of fully charged Eneloops.  I personally love the manual pop-up flash, but I'm guessing that this design is not for everyone.  The flash is much further away from the lens than most point and shoots which helps to reduce redeye.  The flash is also bigger and more powerful than the flash units in the Elph models.  The flash recycle time is fairly slow.  Shot to shot recycle time without flash is about average for a point and shoot.  Time to focus is also about average for a point and shoot.  There is no HD video option and the sensor in this camera is a little smaller than just about every other Canon Powershot available today.  I don't mind the lack of HD video and the smaller sensor does not appear have a negative impact on the image quality (compared to other Powershots).  This is a pretty big and heavy point and shoot, I wish the camera had a more defined grip (like my old A570IS).This camera is a very good value for $180 as long as you are not expecting D-SLR results.  It provides better results than the Elph sub-compacts and it has a lens with a much wider range of focals (wish it went wider).  I'd recommend avoiding the two Smart Auto modes, use \"P\" mode instead.  As far as image quality goes, the SX120 is probably the third best Canon point and shoot available right now.  The much more expensive G11 and S90 are better, the rest of the Canon lineup is either about equal or worse.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera", "Author": "Dorinda Michaud", "ReviewID": "R2UYSSCHDIMREH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera first and foremost because it takes AA batteries, so I can find replacements anywhere and since I already have banks of AA rechargeables for everything else in the house anyway, it's perfect.

Still a bit orange (less than with default color setting) skin tones. Now came the next bad part. 50% of the pictures were overexposed as in the there was so much flash that people's faces were showing huge amounts of white reflection. I was again able to reduce the flash by doing down 2 points with flash compensation. That also did not work well with all targets.

Canon needs to improve their AWB performance (I have read at dpreview that their rebel slrs are no better at AWB). I have seen how bad their AWB is with this camera.Just FYI: All me shots were indoors in tungsten or CFL light with f2.8 (no zoom), shutter speed calculated by camera, either most of them in the  P mode (so that I could correct the bad settings camera was picking). In the auto mode it kept going to ISO 640 even with plenty of light in the room and had very poor results.

These really complement the various settings I encountered.  When I was disappointed at the seeming lack of color of some sunset shots I took, I examined the camera and found a \"Sunset\" setting.  The photos that were then produced were fantastic!  It is important to adjust the camera for the setting preset for your situation.  The ability to change so many aspects of the camera settings manually was an added bonus.  The option to take macro shots also made my day when trying to photograph some of the local flora during my trip.The 10x optical zoom was a real boon, and even the digital zoom mode the pictures were clear and crisp.  I took photos of flowers in trees as if I was 3 feet away from them when I was more like 20 feet away.The flash on demand worked extremely well and timing was perfect.The bad:Almost nothing.  The automatic focus was a bit glitchy at very long distances/zoom levels.  It wouldn't stay focused, but move around a bit, and so I sometimes had to time the shot for when it was most in focus.  But again, this was only when I attempted to take shots at extreme distances/zoom levels.There were just a couple of times when I wished the camera had a view finder due to difficult lighting situations where viewing the large LCD screen was difficult.Conclusion:This is the Swiss army knife of point and shoot cameras, and made me feel like a pro (which I was at one time).

This replaces a PowerShot A620 I got in late 2005 which was starting to fail after taking some 30,000 pictures of everything from vacation shots to in the field reporting for a small local newspaper I worked for.  Four years of use is what I expect out of any digital camera before technology advances force me to go and get a new one.The good:- Excellent optical zoom lens.- Sharp pictures.- Uses AA Batteries (Nothing worse than a camera with custom lithium batteries going dry in the field)- Light and compact.- Closeable flash (it won't go off unless you raise it - good in no-flash/no camera situations)- A wide variety of automatic and custom user settings (although I usually go automatic)- Good video capacity, even though this is a point and shoot camera.- Huge viewscreen.- Solidly builtThe bad- The camera constantly thinks the older rechargeable batteries are dying, even when they are freshly charged.  Annoying, but it usually goes away if I turn it off and turn it back on again.- The viewscreen needs a bevel to set it in for protection - the A620 had a movable swivel screen you could flip out and around to protect, or take oddball shots, which I really miss here.- Larger files (10+ minute videos actually) require me to hook the camera directly to the computer to download, rather than via a card reader.  Annoying, but this might just be a computer glitch and not the camera's fault.- Cramped controls - But then, all these cameras have tightly packed controls, all on the right side.  The preview button in particular seems poorly placed, since my thumb keeps turning it on, despite the recess.Overall, the bad points are more annoyance and my wishing they kept the familiar A620 shell for this camera, since I was so used to it.

I expected the SX120 IS to take good snapshots of my kids indoors, using Auto mode, in various lighting conditions (by \"good\" I mean as good as my SD1100). Unfortunately, this is not the case. I haven't even tried the SX outdoors, but the results I've gotten indoors have prompted me to return the camera to the retailer. I simply need a camera that takes great shots of my kids in Auto mode.A few other things I did not care for:- The battery door was tricky to open and in some instances took me 20 seconds to successfully open. Perhaps my camera was just a lemon in this regard; I can't be certain.- The camera is somewhat heavy but does not provide a good way to hold it, at least for my small-ish hands. The very place I want to place my thumb has the Play button, and the rest of my hand seems to search for something to really hold on to.- The scroll wheel (not sure what to call it) sometimes \"moves\" when I could swear I haven't even touched it. I feel that the scroll wheel, while handy in some instances, causes more problems than it's worth.Any one of these annoyances might be all right on its own, but when I put all of the factors together, it's clear that this is not the camera for me.UPDATE November 2011: After I returned this camera, I saved up and bought a Canon Rebel XSi. I am so very, very glad that I didn't keep the SX120IS. Many people love this camera, and I'm glad it works well for them. For me, I just couldn't get past the poor, strangely colored indoor shots (Auto mode) that I got using the particular SX120IS that I had purchased. If it took worse shots than my Canon SD 1100 IS, what reason did I have to keep it? This camera seems to have a lot going for it, based on all of the positive reviews here.

I am sad to say, however, I no longer have this camera. I loved it so much; it was a gift 3yrs ago for Christmas, and I used it to death until I lost it on trip to Reno mid-last year.  The biggest thing that impresses me about this camera is that I dropped it several times on very hard surfaces, including sharp rocks while hiking in the mojave desert, and while it got a bit dented, it never effected the functionality.  Being the clumsy and accident prone person I am, this is a very important feature in any electronic I used, it had better be able to take a bit of a beating and not broke just because I dropped it on the floor a couple of times.  I noticed a lot of the people complained about the picture quality, but when using this camera, it is important to make sure you have it on the right picture setting, there is a little wheel on the camera with which you can change to various settings for pictures such as: \"Outdoor\", \"landscape\", \"party\", \"children\", etc, etc.  If you are in landscape mode and try to take pictures of people of close, it is not going to be the best picture.  This happened to me more than a few times, many times, I hadn't remembered ever changing the setting, so be sure to check that while using it.  As long as I had it on the right setting my pictures always came out crystal clear, and even my father whom is a professional photographer was impressed with many of the pictures I took with this camera.  The video quality of this camera is very good, but the background noise is a problem if you are filming in a noisy area, but it still works just fine. I filmed in a lot of different places, concerts, karaoke, at home, outdoors, etc, etc.  It is definitely a good camera for home movies, not so much for filming concerts or the like, it just picks up too much background noise for that.  When taking video with this camera, be warned, it will run out of batteries very fast.  The batteries last a while when taking pictures without flash, but with the flash or in video mode, they die fairly quickly, I always carried extra batteries with me, that didn't bother me, though I did sometimes wish this had its own rechargeable battery instead of using double AA's for that reason.  I took thousands of pictures with this camera, and I loved it.  I found it takes pictures best outdoors, it does pictures indoors good, if you have a good light source, but not so much in dark places with the flash, it only takes okay pictures in dark locales.  I took a lot of great outdoor pictures though, hands down, this is where this camera excels is outdoors (with or without flash), whether its sunny or cloudy, it works best in natural lighting versus a light bulb.  Like with any camera, you will have to play with it to really get a feel for it, and its quirks, but it is a great camera for its price, and takes great pictures.

Amazon was awesome as always. I have used many Canon cameras (I own an A60, A75, A400, A510, A540, and an A580). I have taken and printed many pictures from all of these cameras. I have always liked the feel of Canon's cameras, because they feel substantial and comfortable.  The first thing I noticed about this camera is how out-of-balance it felt. The grip area was too thin, and it always felt like it was going to slip out of my hands. The large LCD is nice, but would benefit hugely from some kind of hood, or the choice of an optical viewfinder. The LCD is very hard to see in bright sunlight.  The controls of this camera felt well laid out to me. I liked the wheel for scrolling through adjustments or reviewing pictures. Again, they would have felt that much better had the grip been more substantial.  The zoom is magnificent. Control of the speed of it seems well balanced and smooth. I like the automatic lens cover.  Battery life was very good. I was able to take over 200 photographs, some with flash, on one set of batteries with time to spare. I used 2400 mAh NIMH batteries.  I bought this camera in April 2011. I sold it in June. After taking almost 400 photographs with it, I can say without hesitation that I did not like the quality of the photos it produced. This is funny, because most of the professional reviews I read of this camera stated that photo quality was the main redeeming characteristic of this camera. I found it to be most inaccurate while in the \"Auto\" mode. White balance was almost never right, colors appeared under-saturated, and the photos always seemed to be over- or under-exposed. Again, this is with the selector in \"Auto\" mode. I actually got my best photographs in full manual mode. Even in Aperture-Priority mode, my favorite mode when I want to be more creative, the camera seemed hard to predict. The results were most predictable in manual. I spent most of our vacation taking pictures in manual mode so I could get some decent prints! These traits I find unacceptable.  I have snapped gorgeous off-the-cuff photos with my wife's A580 in Auto mode. To me, this is the way \"Auto\" mode should be. I shouldn't have to hope the white balance is correct, or that the camera will choose the best shutter speed and aperture.  My A510, which is a 3.2 megapixel camera, takes beautiful pictures that yield nice 8 X 10 prints. I like the 510's pictures better than the SX120 IS pictures. What gives, Canon?  As a result of these findings, I sold this camera and bought an older Canon Powershot S3 IS 6 megapixel camera, one of Canon's older \"Pro\" cameras. I can say without hesitation that the S3 photos are heads and tails above the SX120. The S3 also feels like a well-made professional piece of gear in my hand, with good balance and a good grip. When I want serious photographic power, this six-year-old, comparitively low-resolution camera is the camera I will be taking with me.  In conclusion, I have to say that I no longer believe in megapixels or that newer is better.  I feel like Canon has dropped the ball with this unit. It has a lot of features and a high-resolution sensor, but if the picture quality isn't there, who cares? I'd rather have an older model with a better feel and better quality prints than the latest and greatest with lousy prints. I'm happier with Canon's older units.

But I up graded my computor and went to Windows 7 and the A-20 could not do Windows 7 easyly. So I decided to up grade to a newer and I hoped a better camera. I did about 3-weeks of research to find a camera that would be the right price, light weight, do very good zoom shots on very small object. There were several different cameras that would fit my list. But I was very use to a Canon camera so that really made me go for another Canon, and the SX120IS. Most of the settings are the same as I had on my old camera, only the SX120IS will do many more things. It takes 3 batterys but for $13 you can buy a external power plug and hardly ever need the batterys. I do a lot of photos indoors so I have very little need of the batterys. The only thing that is a bit troublesome is if you use the flash and have the zoom extended it puts a shadow on your photo. But I have found that I don't need the flash as much as I was using on the old A-20. So I have been able to get around that problem.Also the little book that comes with the camera is pretty poor, there is a much better book on the Canon web sight that was really helpfull.It took me a little time to get use to not having a view finder on the camera but now I like being able to see the whole photo before I snap the picture.With a big enough memory card you can also do really nice sound movies, which is fun.I belive this is a super camera for the price, and easy to use.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Zoom; some major shortcomings though", "Author": "Alexander C. Zorach \"Alex Zorach\"", "ReviewID": "R2JM3DTCEXDTQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I tested this product extensively and decided not to buy it.PROS:The optical zoom is simply outstanding.  Even at the full 10X, the camera simply takes outstanding pictures.  Overall, this camera performs very well in settings with sufficient light.This camera is larger than most modern pocket cameras but it's not obscenely huge.  It feels very nice in the hand, making it very easy to keep things stable.I see it as an advantage that this camera uses standard AA's, as rechargeable AA's with long battery lives are inexpensive (under $10 for a four-pack now), making it easy to carry spare batteries in case the batteries die.  Contrast this to most models which use proprietary batteries, which cost $30 and up for a spare, and which usually can't be as easily charged out of the camera (a downside for me, as I cannot charge the batteries while continuing to use the camera).CONS:Low-light performance is poor; I really see no significant improvement over much older cameras.  I have a six-year-old Canon Powershot which is 6 megapixels and only supports up to ISO800, but by contrast, I see little performance over that model.  This model automatically edits-out some of the noise at the higher ISO settings, but the result isn't any better than what I can achieve with the simplest noise filter on any photo-editing software and my old camera.  I also wish it wouldn't do so much software correction: sometimes information is lost and I actually prefer to leave the image with more noise because it's crisper and the noise reduction blurs the image, but this camera doesn't allow you to turn this feature off, at least, not that I could find.Another major downside for me: continuous shooting mode is so slow as to be completely useless (well over 1 second between frames).  It's significantly slower than my six-year-old model, which supported about 3 pics per frame.---Bottom line?  If you mainly want this camera for its zoom and using it outdoors and in bright conditions for still shots, it is an outstanding choice.  But if you care about continuous shooting, low-light conditions, I think it's worth spending a little more to get something better.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3UM2V5G0JXJ2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

The other ones out there had a built in battery that you had to plug in to recharge or had the other non-standard size cells.

It gives the user the option of\"point and shoot\" operation, specific environment setting or selectedaperture and shutter control.I was using the A75 model when I switched to the SX-120 so I can onlycompare those two.The 120 takes great pictures.  I've only displayed the pictures on PC andhand held screens so I can't comment on the print quality.  At 10 megapixels,prints should be pretty good.  (The jpeg files are more than three times thesize of those from the 3.5 megapix A75)I like the expanded scene setting options, the super zoom capability,the large display screen and the high quality pictures.I also like that it only needs 2 AA batteries rather than 4.  (The shootingbatteries last longer since there is a separate button battery for keeping date/time).I appreciate the manual flip flash which means you're unlikely to havethe flash go off when you didn't intend it to.  (happened a lot with the A75)I don't like the lack of a printed user manual.  Even the user guide on pdffile is not thorough enough to cover the capabilities of the SX-120.I don't like the controls.  They feel flimsy and are bunched together.  The camera lacks the solid feel of the A75 which has a firm grip and solid controls.  I also think the SX120 battery cover feels dangerously close to snapping off against the spring loaded batteries when I open it up.In spite of those foibles, I am satisfied with the SX-120", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "SharonC", "ReviewID": "R1GE6LCUE9HICC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was so stoked to buy this camera after reading the great reviews.

However, this is not the camera for food photography. I spent a lot of hours with this churning out photos that will land me in the food blogger photograph razzies.  (The website is in my profile.)  For the longest time, I thought it couldn't focus up close;  it will, though, but it's so exact that you have to get out the measuring tape, use the manual focus, and make sure your tripod is exactly that many centimeters from what you want to focus on. (Literally, you'll need marking tape.)The \"Macro\" setting has a focus screen in the camera, but it's either unreliable, or it's just hard to read.  I'd photograph something, and all that would be in focus, from a foot away, would be the surroundings--or the spoon in the bowl, or some random detail.In addition, indoors on automatic and a white counter, it thinks everything is light blue.  On a wood grain counter, it thinks everything is orange.  You have to set the white balance (which it won't allow you to do in automatic.)  Basically, unless you're photographing food outdoors in sunlight, this produces bad photos--and that's probably true for other close-up shots as well.Also, the battery life has you praying that it's fragile enough to break when dropped. (Unfortunately, it's not.)Get a DSLR with an f1.4  50mm lens, if you want to photograph food.

I'm just a regular person who loves to take pictures of everything.I've had this camera for over a year now. It worked fine for about 6 months and all of a sudden, I was having battery problems. I'd put in fresh batteries and it would give me a low battery message and then shut off.  I googled it and did not want to have to return it to Canon and pay fees plus shipping to have it repaired. I found a free and quick fix which actually does work. When you open the battery cover, there's the metal piece on the cover that touches the battery. Take a small, THIN, piece of cardboard (like from a cereal box) and shim it underneath the metal piece. This will make it more snug against the battery when you close the cover.This solved my \"low battery\" problem and the camera functions fine now. As far as picture quality, it's great for the price. It takes pretty good pictures in low light settings and at night. It's not as good as the flash of the Canon A630. I loved that camera, to death.The flash is good and bad. It brightens up well when taking pics in dark places or at night. HOWEVER, it takes a while to recharge so you can take another picture. I HATE that about this camera. If you're trying to take a picture of something that's happening in the evening (like a friend falling out of her chair), you'll miss the moment waiting for the darn flash to charge up.Aside from the battery and flash issue, overall this camera does its job and takes nice photos. It's not too big and not too heavy. The screen is nice and big and it takes very good video too. Not HD quality but not fuzzy wuzzy wuz a bear quality either.If you're trying to capture something right then and there, it's pretty fast at turning on and loading up. Not as fast as the sony \"flip the cover open\" cybershots. But, this one isn't too far behind.The optical zoom is fantastic.

I was on vacation when it broke, so I had to buy a camera quickly. This camera was well-reviewed and my sister likes her Canon cameras, so I decided to buy this one.

I've read the manual over and over again trying to figure out how to do this and it just doesn't seem possible.3) Thirdly, It sucks batteries dry in no time. I have to carry two sets of spare batteries.4) The photos aren't as crisp and vivid as they were with my Kodak camera.

This camera has done all that remarkably well for the price. I've had it over a year and have shot lots of pictures in lots of situations, including back-up photographer for two weddings. Most of the time the pictures are crisp and clear. My only complaint is that in certain lighting it overexposes the picture and with limited photo-editing capabilities I have some nice pictures that are useless. It's especially noticeable in late afternoon light for some reason. But for quick pictures of moving children/animals in decent light it is fantastic, and also for close-ups and still life shots.

Save the money and buy this one!The only downside (and I'm sure every rating on here says this) - the battery life. And also the big size won't fit in a lot of camera cases. But what do you expect with 10x zoom?Unfortunately I dropped it down the paved road of a mountain and it was broken for a while (cursed \"Lens Error\"). I finally got it to work again yet the picture quality seems poorer and pixelly-er, and has trouble focusing. I'm so depressed. I'm looking into buying a cheaper point and shoot Canon because my photography interest has diminished since I got this. I had it for about a year and a half.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "In depth review by a college student.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R3JQ9VQD0MLZY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before going into my review, a little bit of background:I've always had an interest in photography, but I never had my own camera to take pictures with.  My sister had a Nikon Coolpix S610 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom (Midnight Black), which I would borrow from her whenever possible.My uncle was a huge digital camera enthusiast, and he has multiple dSLR's which I had the opportunity to play around with when on vacation with his family.After about two or three years of going through this process, I learned the importance of shutter speed, f-stops, and ISOs... and how my sister's camera didn't have the \"freedom\" I desired.-------\"REVIEW\" STARTS HERE--------I've had this camera for about a year now, and I have to say, I absolutely love it.  Maybe it's because its my first camera, but I have to say... compared to many of my other friends' cameras, the picture quality is amazing.  Compared to a dSLR in good lighting, the quality is pretty decent.~~~CAMERA \"MODES\"~~~~Not much to say about \"Auto\" mode, it basically explains itself.Personally, I think that the \"Easy\" setting is a joke.  I guess I can't really say anything about that function though because I've already gotten accustomed to digital camera jargon through former experience with other family members' digital cameras, so it could be a great help to people new to the field.  However, once you've used it a few times to get used to the camera, I doubt you'll ever use it again.As with PaS cameras, there's the usual settings: Portrait, Landscape, Night Snapshot (basically a low light/Night Mode), Kids&Pets; (similar to the \"Sports\" Mode on Nikon cameras), and Indoor.  On the dial, there's also a mode that shows as \"SCN\"; there, it gives you a few more more-unique scene options: ISO 3200, Sunset, Night Scene (seems to work a lot light Night Snapshot, but I haven't really experimented much), Fireworks, Beach, Aquarium, Foliage, and Snow.  Pretty cool.The Movie mode is alright.  You only digital zoom works while recording, and it drains battery really fast (more on battery drainage later), a single mic makes for mono sound when watching the playback, and moving around too quickly makes the framerate kinda choppy.  But other then that there's not much I can complain about.  Personally, I hardly ever use it... I bought this camera to take photos, not take videos.Av is Aperture Priority mode, which allows you to manually control the f-stops, which range from F2.8 to F8.0; good enough range for me.  Tv is Shutter Priority mode, which allows you to change the shutter speed manually.  The shutter speed ranges from 1/2500 (1/2500th of a second) to 15\" (15 seconds).I tend not to ever use these modes though, because Manual Mode does both of these functions plus more..I think one of the biggest perks to this camera the ability to have full manual control over basically EVERYTHING.  No point-and-shoots can compare.  By just clicking the Func./Set button, I have full access to White Balance, Color Modes, Flash Output, Focus... style? (I forgot what you call this..), single or continuous shots, and picture quality.  In manual mode, ISO cannot be set to Auto.  ISO ranges from 80 to 1600.Program Mode is somewhat like a half-baked Manual Mode.  For me, Program Mode helped as a transition from Auto to Manual modes over the year.  Program gives you access to all the Functions (the menu that pops up after clicking the Func./Set button) but doesn't allow you to set your own Aperture or Shutter Speed. It also gives the option to use auto ISO, which is nice.  Usually when I'm just taking simple, casual photos during family vacations and such, I leave my camera set to Program mode.~~~MISC. FEATURES~~~Face Tracking is totally useless to me.  Doesn't work very well to begin with I think, but that's just my opinion.  Manual focus is the way to go for me.The 10x zoom is fabulous.  When I was at a concert with a bunch of my friends, I was able to get a close-up shot of the band on stage from some 50 feet away.  When the camera is off the lens collapses in on itself enough that I can fit it (somewhat) comfortably in my jeans pocket.Flash is always set to No Flash unless you manually push the flash up.  When taking a photo, the camera will tell you when you need to \"open\" the flash in all modes other then Manual.  Personally, it's not a big deal since the flash can be easily propped up with my left pointer finger without moving the camera too much, but it could be a complaint by some.However, refresh time after taking a picture with flash seems like forever.  I think it's about 3 or 4 seconds for the flash to recharge, in which during that time the screen blacks out and you cannot do anything with it until it readies itself again.On the plus side, you can change the flash output, which can drastically change a photo if you know how to use it right.  Experiment, experiment, experiment!  I'm not sure if most cameras have this ability nowadays, but I think it's a welcome plus.~~~BATTERY LIFE~~~Alright.  Battery life.  This camera runs off of two AA batteries... but really, two Alkaline batteries aren't enough.  After I first bought this camera, it ate through the batteries in less then a day.  After learning of the horrible battery life the hard way, I invested in NiMH Sanyo Eneloop AA Rechargeable batteries... they last so much longer.  If you plan to buy this camera, buy NiMH batteries too.  It's a smart investment.~~~FINAL THOUGHTS~~~PROS~~- Manual Mode- 10x zoom- Decent video recording function- Good range of modes, some which aren't seen on other cameras- \"Easy\" Mode for new digital camera users- Great photo quality; decent in low-lightCONS~~- A lot heavier then a Point-and-Shoot... pretty thick, uncomfortable to hold in a pocket- Short battery life with Alkaline batteries, NiMH batteries are a must- Long flash recharge times.... Face Tracking is useless...CONCLUSION~~Great camera.  Kind of like the middle ground in between a point-and-shoot and dSLR.  Manual Mode gives so much freedom to this camera.  \"Easy\" Mode helps camera newbies learn the basics before jumping into the more complex modes provided.  Large optical zoom, and good to use in most lighting situations.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good, just a bit bulky", "Author": "Thomas Reale", "ReviewID": "R2YDMUH98UCO2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picture quality is excellent, but it's just a tad big for a pocket camera.

I will only buy Canon cameras, their picture quality is superb for a point-n-shoot.  What sold me on the SX120IS was the 10X optical zoom.The 10X optical zoom is spectacular! It gets wonderful pictures of our kids on the baseball field, and at concerts and shows. Pictures that 3X optical zoom could never do. Pictures from 100 ft look like you were standing only 15 ft away. I've had other parents ask me to take pictures of their kids, because they couldn't get close enough for a good shot. Yes, 10X is awesome.The 10 megapixels are good, and the pictures are still great, but I am not impressed by pixel count. The overall picture quality is as good as my previous 3 MP canon, but not better. However, now the files are 3.3 times larger on my hard drive. Slower to open, slower to upload to web, and harder to email. The up-side to 10 MP is when pictures need cropped, there are still plenty of pixels remaining to make a good 8.5x11 print.Do not be taken by the 3.0\" LCD. Yes, it is big. But the resolution is not tight, so even though the LCD is bigger there aren't more pixels in it. And the menu fonts are big. I would have been just as happy with a 2.5\" LCD with a tighter resolution.All of the shooting modes are great, and easy to use. This camera has more \"special\" modes than my last camera, and they are nice. But one mode it does not have, and I miss it, is the panoramic stitch-assist mode.

I definitely prefer its photo quality to similarly priced Kodaks that I had owned previously. Macro shots and high-zoom shots are in focus and auto-adjust to light conditions well, and the shot-to-shot speed is adequate.  The first camera I owned of this type (which I purchased via amazon) was shipped promptly and at a low price.  My only complaint with the specs is the lack of a viewfinder.  With digital cameras I prefer to use the viewfinder rather than the LCD - it allows me to find camouflaged wildlife subjects and quick-moving objects much faster, as well as taking up less power than the LCD.  Not having that option took a long time to get used to.So why did I have to buy a second one?  Well, the first camera only lasted 21 months before the lens motor broke for the second time (the first time, after 9 months of use, I had it repaired).  I subjected the camera to heavy abuse over that time, with many hiking and backpacking trips and sketchy transportation in third world countries.

I tried using high-quality rechargeable batteries but it was still only giving me maybe 50 shots per charge which to me, is unacceptable. I do like to REVIEW my pictures after I take them but that shouldn't drain the battery THAT much. The final straw was yesterday when I tried to take pictures of my children opening their presents at our cousin's house. The battery was completely DEAD and it wouldn't even shut off properly- the lens was protruding. Luckily, the store let me exchange it without a restock fee. I traded it in for the SONY H20 which sports a 10x Optical Zoom, HD movie mode, and a lithium battery...watch for my review in the upcoming weeks. I will admit that it did have \"great\" image quality but what is the point of owning a portable digital camera if you have to constantly worry about the battery life? I didn't want to spend the next 2-5 yrs always having to carry 2x AAs with me wherever I went. Below is my original review:I have owned my share of digital cameras including a 3 MP Nikon Coolpix that I bought back in 2001 for way too much money. I also own a Pentax dSLR but everyone needs a \"compact\" camera. I am a big fan of Canon Powershots but after my recent trip to the US OPEN, was craving a slighly larger camera with much larger Zoom capability. I was debating between this one and the New Fuji 72EXR. One of my travel mates owns the SX110IS and raved about it and I loved the photo quality of her pictures so I was leaning towards the Canon. Plus, there's something about to be said about Canon \"color\"...Fuji color (I owned the Fuji F30), in general, is definitely \"cooler\". And I personally found the dials and menus on the New Fuji a tad too complicated. So on my recent trip to Best Buy, I picked up the Canon SX120IS after much deliberation. I can't say that I regret my purchase as the photo quality is amazing but there are definitely some drawbacks you need to be aware of.First, I found out during my daughter's Girls Scout ceremony, which was held in the gymnasium of her school, that the FLASH RECYCLE TIME can be very long...it took about 4-6 seconds  between photos. Granted, it was in the gymnasium but I wasn't expect it to take THAT long between Flash pictures. After all, it is a 2009 model right? I will post a picture later that is supposed to show them holding up signs to spell D-A-I-S-Y but instead shows them putting down the cards as I missed the shot. I read somewhere that the use of 2 \"AA\"s (vs lithium batteries) is what causes the longer flash recycle times. I do wish that it came with Lithium batteries which leads me to next criticism. Second, the batteries do not last nearly long enough. I got the camera on Wednesday and by Friday, it was flashing the Low battery sign. Granted, I had several events in between but my old Canon Powershot would have easily lasted another couple of weeks. Third, the battery case feels flimsy and unfortunately, the SD card slot is located next to the battery so I end up opening it more than I would like. I would plug it to my PC using an USB plug but again, it would drain the battery. Fourth, the strap it comes with is way too flimsy for the camera. It looks like the same strap they use on their tiny SD30 cameras. I ended up ordering a sturdier leather strap from Gordy's camera straps. So far, these are my four drawbacks with #1 and #2 being the major ones. I can live with complaints # 3 and #4.If you have read up to this point you might ask \"Why are you keeping the camera then?\" I am not 100% sure that I am. If I get too frustrated by the flash recycle times and poor battery life, I might just have to return it. But for now, I want to try to work within its limitations for two reasons: Great Image Quality and 10x Zoom. I don't \"need\" HD video (it would have been a nice bonus) or super-slim factor but I do require Great Image Quality and wanted the extra Zoom. As for the flash recycle times, in most cases, it's much faster than it was in the gymnasium. And I do have a battery charger + rechargeables I will dust off and try. I will update this review if I decide to either return it or have learned to LOVE IT despite its limitations. If you do buy this camera, definitely invest in a screen protector.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon Fodder", "Author": "L. S.

Nor with my first digital camera, an HP 315 Photosmart, which I purchased in 2001.  But Canon! - Do they know about this Powershot SX120IS?  I cannot believe the price being asked for here on Amazon.  I spent $120.00 on my Canon Powershot SX120IS in Fall of 2010.  The price was in line with both this model and others of like features on display at the Staples, Office Depot and Best Buy stores in my area.When the time came to read about the 'enclosed' CD I noticed it missing from the box. I called Canon and they told me (this was in 2010, folks) that they no longer supported this camera. So I still don't have the CD for a camera which is still selling so well Canon doesn't have to provide the camera's necessary contents.This Canon produced very few images (more about that later). None had even decent resolution.  A few are putrid. Some cannot be identified. The Zoom feature makes one shift toward and away from the subject, thus making this 'adjustment' anything but automatic.  The results are just what you can expect from a photographer trying to frame a shot while dancing.To get the exact idea as to what you can expect, see the manual page \"Pressing the Shutter Button\". Forget doing group shots.And forget about those pix of the kids when they're little, or your folks at their 50th wedding anniversary, or of any occasion where people tend to move.  Because unless everyone stands perfectly still while they wait for the shutter sound, which actually varies(!), Canon promises blurred images and lack of focus.  Oh, and no time release, of course, because one cannot know at what instant this little Canon decides to take the photo.  Good-bye spontaneity, says Canon.I hope no one goes through anything like my disaster: I had a 256 card in the slot.  When it read 'full', I went to download the images. Although I hadn't used it very often, I knew I'd taken hundreds of photos in the past year or more.However - the entire number of shots downloaded from its full-up 256 card was .... 16.  Yes.  The rest are gone forever.  And many of the people on those images are now gone forever themselves.  Thanks, Canon.I was impressed that it contained a video camera, but I found the jumble of instructions in the manual more trouble than it was usually worth. On vacation last year the flash just suddenly stopped working for the first time. When I got home it worked again, but since then it only works intermittently; I absolutely cannot depend on it.  As for the video footage...remember where I said everybody must stand still to avoid loss of focus?  Just like dancing while fiddling with the Zoom and the warnings about the hazards of \"Pressing the Shutter Button\".There is a definite asset with this camera:  It really feels good in the hands.  The optics are exquisite, but to what end?

Knight \"Efrin Knight\"", "ReviewID": "R297U7326LBAC2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1) GENERAL THOUGHTS about Canon old SLR cameras and \"CANON SX 120 IS\" digital cameraSince 1973, when I bought my first Canon 814 super 8 movie camera, I have always been loyal to the brand and I currently have two super 8 cameras (Canon 1040 silent and 1014 XLS sound) that I'm saving for some savvy collector who would like to buy them, plus several SLR: a New F1 with AE finder, two A1 with winders and one outstanding T90, with a set of FD Canon lenses ranging from an outstanding 20 mm f2.8 to an excellent 85 mm f1.8, including a rare FD 50 mm f1.4 and a little wonder called \"35 mm Tilt and Shift\" (all manual) for architecture shots.Unfortunately, I have never purchased a digital SLR because Canon technicians were not smart enough (or honest enough...) to offer an adapter allowing me to use (even manually!) my excellent FD lenses that I refuse to throw away in order to buy the new autofocus ones, especially the 35 TS for which I paid more than $700 thirty years ago!  If they had made this adapter, I would have already purchased at least two digital SLR cameras.Nevertheless, I did buy a digital A85 several years ago that I still have and which makes excellent pictures.A year ago, in March 2010, I bought my second digital Canon camera: the \"SX 120 IS\" from Office Depot because I had a $60 reward card from them and because they also accepted a $25 coupon, which lowered the price to a mere $128 with tax out of my pocket.  After taking a few pictures along the beach, I packed it and returned it for a full refund, except for the $25 coupon that I lost.2) THE ALMOST PERFECT \"CANON SX 120 IS\" DIGITAL CAMERAThis could be the perfect camera... IF it had a viewfinder!  Unfortunately, whoever designed this (would be wonderful) camera, decided NOT to put a viewfinder, which killed the sale!It is as small as my old A85, it therefore fits in a shirt's pocket, and has the same familiar selector on top allowing you to choose between AV (Aperture Value) if you want to work on aperture priority, TV (Time Value) if you prefer to select your speed and let the camera choose the aperture, and even a manual mode.  In addition, it also has several all automatic point-and-shoot modes that I always ignore!On the other hand, it works on AA batteries that you may find anywhere.  Therefore, you will never have to stop shooting when your rechargeable battery runs dead in the middle of the jungle: all you need is a pair of fresh alkaline batteries that won't dig a hole in your pocket because of their weight!Finally, the 10X optical zoom (equivalent to a 36 --> 360 mm on a 24 X 36 SLR format) is far more than the mere 3X of my A85.So why did I return it after taking a few excellent pictures along the beach?Simply because I was shooting blindly, due to the fact that it has no viewfinder and it is impossible to compose a picture with the screen under direct bright sunlight, as we have in our sunny Miami Beach!  As I said, the absence of viewfinder killed the sale!Last December, I bought the \"CANON SX 20 IS\" which also works on alkaline batteries, has a 20X optical zoom and, most of all, a viewfinder, but it is almost twice as thick as the \"SX 120 IS\" and it is therefore far from fitting in my shirt pocket.  I have not tested it yet because I have been too busy with my last academic book about French dramatist Jean Anouilh (550 pages in French that will soon be listed on Amazon) but I expect to do it next month during my trips to Seattle, Las Vegas and Montevideo.  A detailed review will follow most probably by the end of the year.3) CONCLUSIONIF I were still living in Paris, France, with a handful of sunny days per year, I might have kept this very good and handy camera.  But since I now live in Sunny Miami Beach, it is totally useless for me without a viewfinder because it is absolutely impossible to compose the picture on the screen under bright sunlight.  True, you could shoot blindfolded and spend several hours later reframing each shot in the computer.  But ever since I started taking pictures of landscapes and architecture in the 1960s, I never point and shoot; I think, frame and reframe before pressing the button.  This was a must when you had to pay a fortune to buy and process color slides before the digital waste era!Now, if you can afford to pay a beautiful secretary to stand behind you with a huge black umbrella and shade your screen while you frame, this might be a good option.  But since I'm just a French professor working almost for free at FIU, this solution is out of question for me!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, awesome honeymoon photos from Hawaii", "Author": "pangiebear", "ReviewID": "R3MYOWCUGJIA2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the older model of this camera (SX110) for my bridal shower, and after having it for a month I got \"lens error\" and it just would not work.  So I went to the store and tried to exchange, but SX110 was no longer there.  They did have the new SX120, so we got that!  So far have not had any problems with the dreaded \"lens error\"!!!So I've had this camera since October 2009 and really like it.  The zoom is amazing.  I can't wait to use it at the Lady Gaga concert I'm going to in a couple of weeks, haha.  Have used it at baseball games and gotten great shots of the players.Husband and I used it in Hawaii and we have amazing pictures.  I was told by friends that some of our shots look \"professional quality.\"  We plan on getting large prints of some of the scenic shots and framing them in our bedroom.  The different settings are great, sunset is especially awesome.  We used that a lot on our trip.  We bought a tripod and used the self timer to take pictures of the two of us together on the beach (it was a secluded beach).  Self timer is great.  I actually have not read the manual, so I'm sure this camera does a bunch of things that I am not even aware of.  I love taking pictures, and would like to learn more about photography in the future.  I think this camera will be a lot of fun to learn on.I wanted a camera that was more durable and better quality than standard point and shoots.  I've had cameras in the past that are so little and fragile that they get busted easily.  I never had luck with HP or Sony, my mom has Canons and her cameras last and last, so that is why I went with a Canon this time and I think Canon is the best.One thing...I wish I had had a waterproof digital before going to Hawaii.  We had to leave this camera in the room a lot if we were going snorkeling or surfing.  We bought a couple of disposable underwater cameras but the pictures got ruined in processing.  Tons of awesome photos that we lost, and who knows if we will ever get back to Hawaii again.  IF you are going on any kind of tropical or beach vacation, I suggest looking into getting a waterproof digital.

So it gets three stars.Despite it's early demise, this camera and I took about 600 pictures at different settings and got to know each other quite well.Dislikes:- Bulky and heavy.  There is no way to comfortable carry this camera around and still have it readily available, unless you hang a case around your neck or on you belt.  Compared to other digital cameras, this puppy is huge!- No decent dynamic range compensation.  If you're background is very bright, don't try to take pictures of dark subjects.  Also, I found it impossible to take good pictures of people wearing baseball-style hats in bright sunlight, because the camera either the face was too shadowed to recognize or the highlights were completely blown out.- In program mode, the camera always defaults back to the 'center averaged' exposure control setting, which sucked when taking high-contrast photos.  Using 'spot metering' was the only way I could get acceptable shots of people and bright backgrounds.- No zoom during video.  I've owned other a-series before, and this has always been an annoyance.  I was able to take some good video of a helicopter as it landed, but it took about six tries.  Also, camera shake is pretty bad during the video without having some kind of object to stabalize your hand on.- No wide angle lens.  Really missed this during group shots.- Durability.  After less than a month of ownership, the camera simply froze.  I couldn't get the screen to turn on or the lens to retract.  This is the second time a canon has done this to me, and the last time I will be buying one for the foreseeable future.  To be fair, it did experience some hot and dusty conditions, but my Panasonic has been through similar conditions and three years later still works just fine.Likes:- At its best, this camera took pictures to rival a DSLR.  Seriously, I took pictures alongside another person with a Canon Rebel, and our pictures came out very similar.  We even switched cameras for a bit and the only real improvement I noticed was the almost instantaneous focusing speed of the rebel.  Reviewing the images, I also noticed that the rebel produced a very nice background blur for portrait shots, while the background remained sharp for the A120IS.  But at a $800 price difference, I was very happy with my camera.  Also, its smaller size meant that I caught more spontaneous shots than her because I could carry my camera with me everywhere.- AA batteries.  I spent two weeks with no electricity and never had to worry.  This camera ate a set of batteries every day and a half, but I brought about a million AA's so it wasn't a problem.  It also accounts for most of the bulk of the camera, but it was worth it to be able to take as many pictures as I wanted.- Fast.  From sitting in my helmet on the ground, to taking a very nice picture of a fire truck speeding by was just a few seconds.  I never missed a shot because the camera wasn't fast enough.- Long zoom.  With the lens fully extended, this camera picked up on slightly more details than I could see with my naked eye.  There was also no distortion at all.- Decent low-light photography.  This camera had a hard time with multiple fast-moving subjects under florescent lights, but that is very forgivable.  Otherwise, it performed relatively well in dim lighting conditions.Overall, I was very happy with this camera.  For a very low price, it took some gorgeous pictures.  It's definitely fighting above it's weight class.  Yes, you make some trade offs, but if you're looking for something cheap, AA battery powered that still takes good pictures, I would highly recommend this camera to you.I would say this camera's ideal use is as a back-up camera or as a vacation camera.

The \"upgrade\" was less than satisfactory.1) Shape & size: The shape and smaller size of the SX120 do not allow me to get a firm and comfortable grasp of the camera with my left hand.2) Weight: I prefer the additional weight of the S2, suspecting that I had less camera shake.3) Viewfinder: I have never had a camera until now without a viewfinder. I thought I could adjust to its lack in the SX120, but this is like waking up in the morning with my right arm missing. Well, perhaps a touch of hyperbole.4) LCD monitor. The larger LCD monitor on the SX120 is fun, and makes messages easy to read. The monitor on the S2, however, could swing out and swivel up or down, making it ideal for shots in a crowd with the camera above the head or a horizontal shot in the wetlands at ground level.5) Neck strap: The S2 had two eyelets for a neckstrap, which was ideal for the way I used the camera--hands free until I needed the camera, but the camara immediately accessible. The SX120 has only one eyelet for a small hand strap, requiring one hand to hold the camera, or requiring the camera to be tucked into a case.6) User manual: I referred to the substantial user manual for the S2 often enough that I packed it in the camera case. The user manual for the SX120 is only online.The functions for the two cameras are similar but not identical, and the ways of accessing them are sufficiently alike that the transition from the S2 to the SX120 was smooth. The Easy mode of the SX120 is a handy way for another family member to use the camera without giving detailed instructions.I'll get along with this camera, but for things that are important to me, this is a downgrade.

In this respect, the Cannon SX120IS has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  Outdoors in the daylight, it is quite good.  Great pictures in bright light, good zoom and the IS works well.  In dim light the pictures will darken a fair amount, but can be brightened by your PC software.  Bring it indoors, in lower light and it's limited f# lens and other compromises will limit what you can and can't do in the  auto mode.  It's basically set up to reduce shutter speeds for lower picture noise.  This works well for still objects, or posed shots.  You can often take such shots and get good results without flash.  But any motion by the object can result in blurring of the object.  Even people just walking, even if you use flash.  This is not a camera to take to a wedding reception and necessarily expect to get great pictures of people dancing and moving around.  Shortly after getting the Camera I took it to the US National Botanic Garden in Washington DC to take pictures of the Christmas decorations, including the model train exhibit.  I used the auto mode, and could not get a picture of the moving trains without significant blur, even with flash.  I got few useable pictures from the train exhibit.  My older Kodak Z650, with it's fairly powerful flash, would have nailed the train shots in its auto mode.  Later I took it to a birthday party and took lots of pics of people moving around and posed.  Posed pics were great.  Shots of people moving around, cutting cake, etc, showed lots of moving object blur (including moving hands, arms etc).  In addition, the camera exhibits  a particularly annoying green case under florescent lighting, which is hard to deal with (even with Photoshop) particular when there is a mixture of florescent and incandescent lighting.  Also,  the camera does not have a view finder.  Just has a large LCD, which (as on all digital cameras) is near impossible to see in sun light and is largely useless for determining if you have taken a really good quality picture.

This camera is a terrible option, too low grade all around for anyone who wants a clear photo and more expensive than the cheap $100 alternatives. I hope someone will take this off my hands via ebay. Oh, I should mention each time my husband uses it he complains too. Really a terribly poor thing for Canon to put it's name on.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "why?", "Author": "Mr. Timothy L.

The incompatibility means OS 10.6x users cannot use the picture organizing software that was part of the price of the camera.  I bought my camera online through Amazon.

The sony w150 I have takes better clearer pictures at dusk and mid afternoon. and the canon S5is takes better in the daylight and indoors.The sx120is is a good camera if you only want one camera and want it kinda small and I do like the lens cover better than a cap. also you can see the screen ok in the sun but the color is not really correct.
