After that experience, I decided to give the new Powershot S3 IS a chance.  Sure it might not be small enough to fit in a pocket, but what a camera!  The pictures are great with sharp images from corner to corner, a 12x zoom lens, and an extremely effective Optical Image Stabilizer.  The benefits of the the Optical Stabilizer cannot be understated on a camera with such a long zoom range.  When you zoom into maximum telephoto every slight movement of your hands results in a huge movement at the lens.  With the stabilizer though it eliminates that problem.  The pictures have low noise levels from 80-400 ISO, I have not tried the ISO 800 yet, though it should be nice to have in a pinch.  The tilt and swivel LCD is awesome, you'll wonder how you got along without it before.  Battery life is excellent and I cannot underemphasize the benefit of the camera running on standard AA batteries.  If ever you find yourself in the middle of a day of shooting and the batteries die simply pop into a local convenience store and pick up some more.  I would suggest you purchase a good set of rechargeable NiMH batteries though.  The movie mode is great with the ability to zoom, a dedicated record/stop button, and stereo sound!  Plus, finally a Canon digital PowerShot with a live histogram!  You will not be disappointed in this camera.", "Date": "May 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Camera aims to make better photographers", "Author": "K. Williams", "ReviewID": "R2APJV0YJQ8BL2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SO MANY FEATURES. SO LITTLE TIME.Is it possible for a camera to make an amateur photographer better? Apparently this is Canon's goal with the S3. It provides easy access to controls that compensate for common difficult shooting scenarios. Most point-and-shoot (P+S) cameras have few buttons - relying instead on hidden menu driven options. While this may make the camera appear less intimidating initially, locating the correct setting while attempting to frame and photograph action or bad lighting subjects is frustrating. As a result, many features go unused.By way of comparison, the S3 has at least ten more buttons than my discontinued P+S MINOLTA Dimage G500 (5MP 3x optical zoom). And many of the buttons on the CANON are multifunction depending on whether you are shooting in one of several modes, playing back stills, or movies - providing dozens of useful options.The CANON S3 has a button for instant access to movie recording (with on-screen options for 320x240 15/30/60 fps or 640x480 15/30 fps) up to 1GB or one hour per clip. Stereo sound and zoom functions accompany movies. There are dedicated buttons for ISO, sound recording, flash, continuous shooting, macro, manual focus, display, and a customized shortcut. The mode dial on top of the camera includes settings for many typical situations such as portrait, landscape, sports, nighttime, and panoramic. There is also an AUTO[MATIC] mode. But if all your shots remain in this setting, you might as well use a P+S model.The key benefit of the many buttons and dials on the S3 is quick access to a wide variety of useful features without taking your eye off the subject. The FUNC[TION] button can present a tremendous amount of pertinent information while the focused image is visible. Everything from remaining number of pictures and image quality to white balance and ISO feedback neatly border the subject. The DISP[LAY] button activates grids and histogram, switches between LCD and viewfinder, or reduces the amount of on-screen information. Either screen is equally informative and useful for making adjustments. The MENU button differs in that it brings up infrequently used options that temporarily replace the focused subject.Elaborating a bit further on the impressive display of the CANON S3, it does a good job of simulating selected options. Punch up greens, blues, reds, all colors, neutralize, lighten or darken skin tones, photograph b+w or sepia and see the results before snapping the picture. It is possible to obtain untainted color even with mixed indoor lighting. In addition to AWB (automatic white balance) there are seven other settings accessed from the FUNC[TION] button. The last is custom metering. Just point at a white object in the room and press the SET button. No more green or orange casts on indoor photos!Another common lighting problem occurs when a subject stands in front of a bright background or if frontal light from the sun washes out the highlights on faces. After a quick tap of the FUNC[TION] button, the first option in the upper left corner is exposure compensation. Use the omni selector left arrow to darken the foreground or right arrow to lighten it. If indoors or a relatively short distance away, you might also enable the flash. (For those with traditional photography background, there are also options for aperture priority or shutter speed priority on the mode dial.)Despite efforts to write a short review, there is still much more to talk about. Image stabilization (IS) and the 12X optical zoom are significant features that work well together. In fact, now I understand why smaller digital cameras without IS typically only include 3 or 4x. The slightest hand movement is greatly exaggerated at high magnification. IS compensates for this movement. The S3 provides four options for IS: 1) continuous (constantly stabilizes preview which uses more power); 2) shoot only (stabilizes image when shutter button is pressed); 3) panning (stabilizes vertical movement only for tracking horizontally moving cars, race horses, bikers or runners); 4) off (stabilization is not necessary for tripod).The 12X optical zoom can optionally be supplemented by 4X digital, making it possible to achieve as much as 48X zoom. A ring around the shutter button rotates clockwise to enlarge and vise versa. This brings up a slider in the viewfinder. If digital is activated, the white slider goes to a point and stops at 12X. Press it again and the slider is appended with blue as the digital zoom is progressively applied. I uploaded a picture of a bird in a a 16 foot palm tree with 21x zoom.Panorama assist is yet another outstanding feature. As each photo is clicked, a portion slides over in preview, making it easier to align the next. Software is included to stitch the pieces together or you can use Photoshop's Photomerge under the Automate menu.Image bracketing is also nice for difficult-focus situations; with one press of the button, three slightly different focuses are shot within a couple of seconds - a light, medium, and dark. This is not to be confused with continuous shooting (sometimes called burst mode), which shoots multiple images with consistent exposure as long as the button shutter button is pressed. This is extremely useful when photographing groups of people since it is often difficult to get everyone's eyes open and smiling at the same time. It is also great for photographing small animals with rapid movements like birds.WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?There are a few annoyances that could be solved by spending more. After all, Cannon makes cameras from under $200 to several thousand. Despite big features, the S3 is, relatively speaking, on the low end of the scale. So any apparent design omissions must be kept in context.LENSE CAP FIT: The most minor annoyance is the loosely fitted lens cap that frequently disconnects. Make certain the lanyard string is attached to the neck strap so it won't be lost. The obvious concern is smudging or scratching of the lens. While carrying, frequently check to make certain is on.ACCESSORIES: Canon cut accessories to the bear minumum. There is no case (strap is included), no power cord, no lens hood, and only Alkaline batteries. Purchasing all the necessary options can break your budget by $150-$250 USD. Fortunatelly, some items are common enough that you may not need to purchase everything. I already had a couple of 256MB SD cards for my prior camera. You'll need to factor in the cost of a fast charger with four 2500+ mHa AA batteries (currently around $35). There is also a need for a high-capacity SD card. The included 16MB card will only store four of the highest quality images. About 90 stills can fit on a 256MB card at the highest quality setting. If you require more images per session or will be recording movies, consider a high-speed 4GB card (currently around $100). The S3 is optimized for high-speed cards.LCD BRIGHTNESS: More of an annoyance is the limited pivoting 2\" LCD screen brightness. Take comfort in the fact that some expensive DSLR cameras have only a viewfinder. Fortunately, when the LCD is not visible, the viewfinder on the S3 can be used. The diopter adjustment is handy since I may be wearing single-vision prescription shades, trifocals, or no glasses at all. The two independent brightness settings for LCD or viewfinder are a noble consideration. The LCD just doesn't get bright enough. In time, it is easy to get used to the viewfinder.IMAGE FORMATS: A camera with so many features naturally appeals to the prosumer not ready to make the leap to a full-fledged DSLR. Though this would result in better high-ISO nighttime shots and better daylight images, the cost with multiple lenses could easy triple the price of the S3 and you'll lose some consumer-oriented features. Nevertheless, a non-compressed image mode would be useful - especially with the availability of high-speed 4GB SD cards.Test shots of straight-up blue sky in large \"fine\" and \"super fine\" modes both exhibited pixelization when examining up close. In fact, super fine is slightly more pixelated in large areas of SOLID (perhaps due to sharpening?). This may be considered simulated film grain. There is more color averaging with fine mode producing a smaller, visually smoother images. The \"large\" image setting is 6 megapixels so the anomalies I reference when zooming in 400 percent in Photoshop are not visible on typical prints. When the composition includes many different color changes and fine DETAIL (landscapes, architecture), the super fine mode is much better. Otherwise the detail becomes muddy.I developed a Photoshop action called Smooth Pixels. Though not always necessary, it provides moderate smoothing on 6MP images to reduce pixelization in large areas of flat color. It can also be used to minimize artifacts occurring as a result of saving a JPEG image with too much compression. If you have Photoshop experience these settings may be familiar to you. Opacities can be increased as much to as much as 60% with minimal loss of detail. (A screenshot of the Action palette has been uploaded.)1 Make snapshot2 Duplicate current layer3 Smart Blur (Radius: 1, Threshold: 12, Quality: High, Mode: Normal)4 Set current layer (Opacity: 40%)5 Duplicate Background6 Gaussian Blur (Radius: 0.5 Pixels)7 Set current layer (Opacity: 40%)8 Flatten imageRAW, LZW TIFF (compression usually requiring a PostScript level 3 printer for decompression) or standard TIFF options would be appreciated by those concerned about consistent pixels within continuous color with no artifacts surrounding high contrast colors. It should be noted that each time a JPEG is opened and saved (even with no edits) in an image editor application, there is slight degradation of image quality. This does not occur with TIFF or RAW.WIDESCREEN LIMITATION: I was fooled by the boast of widescreen pictures. This applies only to STILLS. The WS stills are about 25 percent smaller than the maximum 6MP images. The viewfinder adds black bands to help frame WS pictures. Don't expect a low-cost HD WS movie function from the S3.FLASH OPTIONS: The manual pop-up flash could be a bane or boone. It is reasonably strong and there is a three-option dedicated button to 1) always enable the flash, 2) automatically flash only when required, or 3) disable flash. If you forget to lift the flash, automatic doesn't lift it for you. Conversely, lifting the flash when the user option is set to never flash results in no extra lighting. One could look at this as a benefit since less flashing preserves the batteries. It would make more sense to me for the flash to pop-up if needed in automatic mode. Get used to the icon in the viewfinder that indicates the status of the flash (which is grayed when the flash is not up).The S3 has also been criticized because it does not have a hot-shoe connection for a replacement flash. (A handheld flash farther away from the lens is the true solution to red eye.) Canon's less than optimal answer is to provide an optional slave flash that can be used as a supplemental bounce flash positioned closer to the subject or mounted onto the camera using a bracket that connects to the tripod thread. (I have a much less expensive non-digital Canon T-50 SLR with multiple lenses with a hot shoe so adding one to the S3 is possible.)TRIPOD THREAD: A plastic tripod thread is never appreciated. Be careful not to damage the threads or consider using a tripod quick-shoe attachment.ABERRATION: Though improvements are being made, digital cameras (particularly less expensive ones) suffer from aberration, sometimes called purple fringing, surrounding high-contrast areas where a pixels along edges are discolored. The S3 is not exempt - more notably a few pixels of red (NW) and green (SE) misregistration. This is most apparent on photos with very light objects next to color away from the center of focus - particularly on overcast days when the sky is white instead of blue. A 6MP image is scaled down so much for standard prints that the aberration is not usually noticeable. For large prints this may require additional image editing.UPGRADE FROM S2: Owners of the Canon S2 will not find the S3 a significant upgrade. This camera appears to build on prior success with a few additional features to keep it competitive with other brands. In doing so, Canon has left room for even more improvements in an S4. Differences between the S2 and S3 are summed up below. * New sensor (6MP versus 5MP) * Higher maximum sensitivity (ISO 800) * Bigger LCD screen (2.0-inch versus 1.8-inch) * New Sports mode * Record live Histogram * Widescreen shooting mode (stills) * Fractionally larger and heavier * Dark gunmetal (gray) as opposed to silver bodyThe difference between 5MP and 6MP is not perceived in standard size prints (both have far more megapixels than necessary). The extra pixels in the 6MP are useful for retaining more detail when cropping small areas of a photo with image editor software. High ISO (400+) is used for dark scenes when no tripod is available. ISO 800 is largely symbolic in the S3 since results are too noisy (aberrated pixels) to be useful. The 2-inch screen has the same amount of pixels as the 1.8 but it's scaled up a bit. The histogram is an animated graphic that indicates whether the framed subject is under- or over-exposed; this should also be apparent in the viewfinder preview image. Of course widescreen images can be cropped in post-production if it's only an occasional desire.CONCLUSIONSIt will take some time to become familar with all the CANON S3 features. If results are too noisy or blurry, it is likely because the correct setting was forgotten. The CANON S3 is not perfect but, in its price range, includes a very good combination of available technologies with slight image quality sacrifices. Professional photographers may be inclined toward an entry level DSLR (perhaps CANON DIGITAL REBEL XT, CANON EOS 30D, or SONY ALPHA). The S3 is a nice alternative to a dedicated digital camcorder; it can even zoom and shoot high-resolution stills without exiting movie mode. For the best quality stills, movie recording is sacrificed in higher-end cameras.If this review seems like too much to read then the S3 is not for you. There is much more to read -- beginning and advanced manuals for the camera itself in addition to manuals for the software. Prosumers that invest time reading can be rewarded with greatly improved image quality from the S3. Of, course composition is still up to the photographer. ([...]) The prior S2 model may be a better bargain for the cost conscious unless some of the new S3 features listed above are absolutely essential. The typical no-frills consumer might be put off by the plethora of options and prefer a compact P+S with less buttons (CANON POWERSHOT S80, SD500, A540, or A520).(See uploaded pictures of bird in palm tree and building exhibiting aberration. Because the Amazon image processor scales down images as much as possible, there are more image artifacts on samples than on original photos.)", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Better than they say and worse than they say . . .", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1GIKGR0VLOHW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a near pro camera in disguise.  This little wolf really needs you to study it and play with it to get the best pictures, but when you do you are really rewarded.  When I say worse, if you just want a point and shoot  you will get crappy photos sometimes and think you were cheated.If you just select Auto, you will probably be disappointed. Canon makes better point and shoot cameras like the S series.  My wife uses the S80 for her business, my daughter has the S70, and we have two other Canon P&S; around that we all use for fun shots.  I needed something with a real zoom lens and didn't want to do all the way to DSLR as I wanted something that also shot movies.  I'm a HS tennis coach and I wanted to be able to take short videos of my players to help them see their strengths and weaknesses.The S3 takes unbelievable videos!  Better than my sony video camera that cost much more AND it is easier to get them into my computer, edit them, and produce a CD to hand to one of my players. A feature that I didn't find on any of the other competitive cameras was the ability to snap a still picture in the middle of taking a video.  Also like the separate video button so you can take videos without changing anything on the camera, just hit the video button and it starts.It also takes GREAT pictures.  When you understand the options on the camera, you can take pictures that are close to the best you can do with a pro DSLR camera. I now shoot all my normal pics in P mode with it set for ISO 100 or ISO 200 and a 3 shot bracket.  Great pics everytime.  The anti-shake (IS) makes it easy to take great pics in low light.  In low light when I let it go up to high ISO I can get noise like you wouldn't believe.  However, I still get the pictures.  Now that I know better, I can set up the camera to get really good low light pictures without going into high ISO ranges. I also have been able to take wonderful pics of my Koi, my cats, my kids, my wife, my car, my anything that takes my fancy.  I have a framed 10x14 picture in front of me taken of a squirrel in the very top of a 100' redwood tree with the camera at max optical + digital zoom of 48x. Hand held and clear as a bell due to the IS and the optional settings available. Try that at home with any other camera in this price range.Bottom line: after looking at all the current offerings from Panasonic/Sony/Nikon et al, this is the best of the bunch for a prosumer big zoom camera.  None of the rest of them paid any attention to making videos, canon did.  All the rest tried to get our attention by promising more pixels, but Canon when for quality and a reasonable price.  This camera takes better pics than the Panasonic Lumix that costs several hundred $$$ more and has 10 mega pixels -- oh, and the canon is considerably smaller and easier to carry.Accessories: I recommend that you get the Lensmate 52mm lens adapter and the Tiffen 3 pack of filters. I didn't bother with the Canon 58mm stuff, just got everything in 52mm.  Unfortunately Amazon doesn't carry Lensmate but you can Google them. I also got the Raynox .7x wide angle lens from Lensmate at a good price. It has a bit of barrel distortion, but easily correctable with software -- big feature is that it is extremely clear at full zoom.  Much better than the Canon wide angle lens. Case Logic makes a case that holds the S3 with the lens adapter on, so I can carry it around with the UV filter in place.  The Lensmate lens adapter is  made from metal and gives you a place to grip with your left hand so you are extra steady.  Wish that Canon would just put threads on the end of their lenses, but they have their way of doing things.Also got the Transend 4GB 150x SD card.  Works like a charm.  Make sure you low format it before your first use and then do that again every so often to keep the card clean.  Very fast and lets me take up to 30 minutes of videos if I want. Get the SD cards wherever . . . Fry's had the Transend card for $10 less than Amazon.Great camera, well worth the time I spent researching and testing everything available in September through early November of 2006.  I did test every Panasonic, Sony, and Canon model in my price range of $250 to $750. Bought an SD card first and then went to camera stores and tried them all, bought the card home and looked at every pic and video.  I ended up paying $350+ here at Amazon for the S3 which was the best price from a trusted source.Again, what I wanted was a digital camera that could zoom to 10x+, take videos that were as good as my video camera, take fast action still shots in varying conditions, and had a resolution of 5mp or more. I also wanted it to be compact and easy to use, with the capability of using storage cards larger than 2GB. I already have taken almost 2 hours of action videos of my tennis players and several hundred pictures of them.  I also have a batch of family pics that range from grainy to perfect as I learned how to set the ISO properly and use the features of the camera. Lots of educational help available online from Canon and others that is specific to the camera.Bottom Line: buy it.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "A review for the point-and-shoot crowd.", "Author": "Steven A. Godun \"sgodun\"", "ReviewID": "RY6TFEOZT5YEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S3 as a replacement for my PowerShot S10 which has served me amazingly well since I purchased it. My old S10 is only a 2.1MP (megapixel) camera but that suited me just fine, taking tens of thousands of pictures over the past six years that I owned it. My only complaint about the S10 is a common one amongst digital cameras: a crappy 2x optical zoom. The S3's 12x optical zoom was its main selling point for me, and having the PowerShot name behind it sealed the deal.This camera does FAR more than I'll ever use so I'll instead focus (no pun intended) on the things that I particularly like about the camera, from a point-and-shoot perspective. Some of this info may be old hat to the point-and-shoot digital camera crowd, but remember that I'm coming off a six year old camera that doesn't have half as many features.  :)Although the camera is not an SLR camera, it behaves like one. There's an LCD panel on the back of the camera for lining up your shots, of course, and there's also a viewfinder. Looking through the viewfinder reveals another LCD screen that shows you what the camera's CCD is showing. In effect this gives you the benefit of an SLR camera without the extra cost. This forced me to change my shooting style; when I took close-up shots through the (straight-through) viewfinder on my S10 I had to purposefully aim the camera slightly higher in order to properly frame the shot. With the S3 I don't have this bother any more.The screen (both the LCD screen and the one in the viewfinder) displays an astonishing amount of information, most of which I ignore. Two very helpful bits of info: There's a white rectangle in the center which defines the balance point of your shot, and more interestingly, a black grid that really helps you make sure your images are straight. (Speaking of straightness, the camera also has an automatic sensor to determine if you're taking portrait or landscape shots. When you download the pictures into your computer, they're pre-rotated correctly. Very handy. (PS: It interfaces with a standard mini USB cable, and it works flawlessly with Apple's iPhoto software.)If you're taking a picture and you need a flash, the camera will alert you to this fact which is great. Not so great is the fact that it won't alert you until you actually go to take the picture. Considering that you need to manually raise the flash when it's needed, this has the potential for making you lose some candid shots. Tip: Keep the flash raised at all times, and set the flash for \"automatic\" so it fires when needed.The image stabilization feature is downright awesome. I actually had to make a conscious effort to get the camera to take a blurry picture with stabilization enabled. One-handed overhead shots are as clear as a tripod shot.As I said, I bought the camera for the zoom and it doesn't disappoint. The zoom ring is variable in speed (the further you move it, the faster the zoom moves). The image stabilization feature really comes into play at full zoom. I was able to take a not-blurry photo of a news helicopter hovering overhead, with the camera at full optical zoom and without a tripod.The camera takes four AA batteries; Canon provides you with a set in the box. That will be good for about 100 shots, depending on how much you use the flash. Rechargeable batteries are a must; a decent set of rechargeables (2000mAh or greater) will give you about 500 shots. Well worth the extra money. However, I do like that it will take standard AA's in a pinch; my old S10 took a proprietary rechargeable battery and I occasionally found myself with a set of used-up rechargeables when a photo opportunity arose.I have but two complaints about the PowerShot S3 IS. Complaint #1 is the body of the camera is constructed of plastic. My old S10 was metal bodied and survived several trips to the concrete floor with only superficial damage. I daresay a similar incident with the S3 will result in a shattered body. Complaint #2 is Canon's incredibly lame inclusion of a puny 16MB SD memory card. At full quality and full resolution, you might get 4-5 pictures onto the card before it fills up. Canon is just adding to the nation's landfills with these things. The first purchase anyone will make is a larger card (I bought two 2GB cards) and Canon's cards are more expensive (sometimes significantly more expensive) than the competition. The inclusion of a 16MB card is either a joke or an insult; at the very least Canon should have included a 128MB card.", "Date": "August 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Jan S. Rosenberg \"commonsense\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q08ADACRVOXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I struggled with buying a DSLR, having some photography experience, but the attraction of carrying one camera to get both Video and still photos overrode my desire to be a photo purist.  Thus I bought the S3 and am extremely happy with both the quality of the video and the still photos.A few minor drawbacks - I bought the Canon case for it (and sent it back). Unless you will be carrying the camera as is, without the lens shade/lens adapter, the case is useless, too little extra space for any extras. I bought the lens shade/lens adapter as it is the only way to be able to put a protective filter on and I read some reviews that advised it because it protects the lens barrel. I returned those as well. I found lensmateonline.com that makes 2 size lens adapters (52MM and 58MM) in metal (as opposed to Canon's plastic) both in black for the S3 and silver for the S2.  They also have a retractable rubber lens hood available.  I found that if you leave the Canon lens hood on inside while using the flash, you get a dark shadow in the picture, the retractable lens hood saves you the hassle of unscrewing your lens hood - which can be dangerous especially with the plastic lens adapter as it can get cross threaded.The camera itself is phenomenal...", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera, significant limitations, next likely significantly better", "Author": "Kevin K. Fosler", "ReviewID": "R27GU8Y9BA5JFC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a rewrite of a previous review, hoping to be more concise.Pros:-  Feels good, looks good, great ergonomics.  Usually I de-emphasize this, but this is an exception.-  The pictures turn out great.-  The movie mode is awesome, good stereo sound (but see below under cons)-  It is quick and responsive, for zoom and focus.-  The rotating display is nice not only to take pictures of myself, but also to take closer pictures of other people in a candid way -- i.e. you won't be in their face with the camera obviously pointed towards the person.-  Some scene modes on the selector dial which is convenient.-  Flash doesn't automatically pop up.  Most people see this as a disadvantage.  I see it as a great advantage.  If I don't want flash, I leave it down.  It suggests using flash on the LCD.  If I want to use the flash, I then flip it up.Cons:-  Small 2\" LCD, plus inferior viewfinder.  This is almost a show-stopper for me.  This camera is basically an upgrade to the S2.  Due to competition, the next version of this camera is likely to have a larger LCD.  It depends on whether you need an ultra zoom camera now, vs. waiting for next spring.-  There is no date stamp on the photos.  This can be added using Canon's software according to their technical support.-  Plastic camera tripod mount.-  The movie mode produces really high quality videos.  The problem is that they aren't compressed, or as compressed as other cameras.  A movie can be only 1G, and only 8 minutes of video can fit on a 1G SD card.-  Lack of scene modes.A comparison with the new Kodak p712.The new Kodak, also an upgrade (of the 850) now focused quickly and has best in class low shutter lag.  I had the 850 and have the 712, and there is a big difference.The Kodak has better image stabilization.The Kodak has *many* scene modes.  This helps the non-professional get the settings right.The quality of the images is about equal (other than the canon not being as good with image stabilization at maximum zoom).There are more options for flash typesThere are more buttons on the camera for faster settings.The LCD and quality viewfinder make the Kodak a more fun camera.The disadvantages of the Kodak over the S3, is that the Kodak doesn't have a rotating display, so photos of people could be more intrusive.  The Kodak doesn't have the great feel or looks of the S3.I think that I will be rewarded if I wait for the next iteration of Canon's ultra zoom.  With Kodak's larger display, Sony's 3\" display, Canon will have to make theirs bigger.  A Canon with a larger display plus other improvements they may add would be my dream camera.I am not going to keep the Kodak p712 either.  I love that camera, but I want a rotating display.

I wanted a mega zoom with a good feature set and high quality video, since I knew I couldn't also afford a video camera. It shoots such good pix in auto mode, that I find myself rarely using the other settings, at least so far. You can shoot photos while shooting video or shoot video while in still photo mode. The video is high quality, AVI at 30 frames per second, which I believe is better resolution than standard TV. You can use the 12x optical zoom while shooting video. Most digital still cameras shoot video at just one focal length. The camera has two mikes and records CD quality stereo sound when shooting video, though you can set it for lower sound and picture qualities if you like. The built-in flash does an excellent job, and with the standard setting I have yet to get red eye.Image stabilization works very well and is essential with a 12x zoom, especially when shooting video or low light stills. Picture quality is just wonderful in both video and still picture modes. After buying the camera and a 2 gig SD card, I took a bus trip through 28 states visiting friends, shooting hundreds of photos and about 10 minutes of video. The results were great.Photo stitching software comes with the camera and it is excellent. I had been concered about the very limited wide angle capablity, equivilent only to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera. But by taking overlapping photos I got wonderful panoramas and group photos without the usual wide angle distortion and with more detail. While this works best with a tripod, with a little care you can shoot by hand and get excellent results.The batteries are AA. Get a charger and NiMh rechargable batteries. The nice thing is, if your batteries die, you can get a set from the store [uses 4] in a pinch. I was able to shoot 10 minutes of video plus about 150 pix on the batteries that came with the camera. I could have done better, but I spent at least a couple of hours with the camera on, fooling with menus and settings and reviewing the photos and videos.At best resolution and least compression, a 2Gig SD card will hold 715 photos or 15 minutes of best quality video. 4 Gig cards are available, and if you intend to shoot a lot of video, I would strongly recommend one. Also, the faster the card the better. Slow cards won't keep up with best quality video, and time between still shots will be longer. If the card doesn't advertise it's speed it isn't fast enough! Get 133x or 150x speed. This translates to 20mb or 22.5 mb per second. In theory the camera's single shot limit for video is one hour, but it's a non-issue as the 4 gig cards will only hold 30 minutes of best quality video.Things I don't like: 8 gigs for an hour of video is way to high. MPEG2 DVD's will hold up to 4 hours in the same space. The view screen should be bigger in this class of camera. It's better than the previous model -two inch versus 1.8 inch- but it really needs to be larger...that said it's adequate for my old guy eyes, and if I had to give up the ability to adjust the screen to get a larger size I wouldn't. I would also like to set the zoom to a slower rate of zoom when shooting video. Rate of zoom is adjustable, by how far you move the lever, but the throw is too short to be precise.Basically, if you can do without the camera fitting in your pocket you will be very hard pressed to do better than the Canon S3IS.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Oh What A Camera!", "Author": "William S.

The S3 IS was right there at the top of my range so I went to the local camera store to ask about it and look at it in person. I can tell you that it is a very solid feeling camera. It fits in your hands very well and the buttons are all within reach. The photo quality is really amazing. Image stabilization really helps with those long range shots. The multiple shooting modes are really handy too. The only down side to this camera is the number of options available. You can literally get lost in the manual. No worries though. Put the camera in AUTO mode, point and shoot. For most people this should work just fine. The camera is VERY fast. There is NO lag time from the moment you push the shutter button and the time the photo is taken. No more predicting your shots. I am not super happy with the lenses cap. It fits loosely and tends to fall off but there is a lanyard to keep it attached to the camera. Not the most important feature of a camera. The 2\" LCD is pretty impressive as well. The movie mode is nothing short of amazing. If you use it make sure you get a large memory card. I filled a 256 MB card in about 45 seconds of shooting at the highest quality setting.

Half a year and 5,000 pictures later, here are some of my comments:- It is a GREAT digital camera in its own class. By \"class\" I mean one should not compare it with a dSLR because the S3 is not one. So do not expect it to overcome \"shutter lag\" easily, although among other DC (digital camera) I have used, shutter lag on S3 is greatly improved--to a degree that I feel comfortable taking photos in very fast pace, e.g., catching flying birds. (However, only good dSLR can completely eliminate shutter lag and S3 is not a dSLR.) One also should not compare the S3 with the \"small\" point-'n-shoot DCs. S3 is not as small as those--it won't easily slide into your pocket, unless your pocket is relatively big and loose (like mine). But the slightly larger body brings great features none of the small DC can offer.- Big optical zoom (12X) and IS. 12X is GREAT and combined with Canon's Imagine Stabilization, S3 turns into a powerful large zoom camera with superb imagine quality. My recent trips included shooting (with cameras in case you wonder) wild wolf at Yellowstone National Park. And this little S3 came out as the only one that can capture the animals at great distance, along with other \"big guns\" the professionals carry. The IS feature eliminates hand shake with great effect and I could shoot at 12X with low light and still get quality photos. I also highly recommend the \"TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens\" for the S3 (or S2) which gives you another 1.5 zoom that effectively make S3 18X zoom (equivalent to a 600mm lens). Check how much those big telephoto lens cost (close to 10K) ...- Excellent video shooting. Again a feaure one almost never finds on any other DC or dSLR. The S3 takes DVD quality video in stereo sound, not just video clips that most DC can do. This little (almost) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into an early retirement.- Many other great features. However those are more or less standard and one can always try to argue some other DC may have similar or better features. I won't comment on those.In summary, the S3 is a great small-size DC. Its superb lens offers big 12X zoom and IS, two technology of Canon's pride. It also offers DVD video shoot with stereo sound--this feature alone can save you a digital vidoecam.One suggestion--do get a big SD card if you want to shoot video too. I have a 4G SD card and I think 2G is a must. Also battery life is excellent. It uses 4 AA-battery, which seems a lot odd at the beginning. But it comes in handy because as long as you can get AA battery you never worry about power. With typical dSLR, if the battery is out you are done for the day unless you find a power outlet to recharge (and have your charger with you).I do have one small complain. The Menu button at the back of the camera is at the location where my palm presses the body. Sometimes I raise the S3 and I see the menu in viewfinder because my palm has pressed it strong enough to trigger it. Another press is needed and I lost several shots because of this.I have other dSLR with quality lens.

I have been an avid photographer since 1959, starting with the Leica. The enthusiasm of other reviewers for the S3 IS is certainly well deserved. The speed and accuracy of the self-focusing as you change focal lengths is astonishing. At a single focal length moving the camera past a window from inside the house results in a breathtaking and precise change of both exposure and focus.The movie facilities are well displayed also by turning slowly inside a house and watching the exposure and focus change to produce surperb results even through the windows. This is one fine movie camera. The 1 gigabyte limit on a movie should not be a problem since it permits roughly an eight minute movie. Downloading a two minute movie to my Dell desktop required about 10 minutes. After which I had a two minute perfectly focused and exposed movie with stereo sound!As you will quickly find, extreme handheld close-ups will self-focus exactly at the Canon specified distance. Get too close and the camera focuses sharply on the other side of the object you wanted to photograph. Example, small flowers on a bush.One more example. to check the focusing I picked our sleeping dog.

But I had to learn to use it.This is NOT a good choice for the weekend photographer who just wants to take pictures of the kids.  This is a state-of-the-art photography platform with literally hundreds of settings.Some early reviews complained about blurry or grainy pictures.  These people did not know how to set up the camera for the conditions.  Some reviews complain about the color balance or saturation.  But color balance, contrast, gamma, etc. are completely configurable in this camera, so there is no basis for these complaints.A lot of people assume that the \"Auto\" setting will let them take pictures casually or mindlessly with this camera, and get perfect results.  That might be largely true with the cheaper point-and-shoot cameras with smaller lenses, but not with this one.The cheaper cameras with smaller lenses are not capable of attaining the superb performance of this lens.  But because they are smaller, they are \"in focus\" over a wide range, so they produce acceptable pictures more or less regardless of settings or focus.If you are willing to take the time to learn this camera, then I cannot think of a better one.  But like with a musical instrument, you will need to practice.  It takes some time to learn where to put your fingers, and where not to put your fingers, because there a lots of buttons and settings exposed on the surface of the camera.  You will need to learn to use the autofocus to best advantage, and learn the proper program modes to match with your shooting conditions.If you take the time to really learn the camera, you will control a device that covers the range from a microscope to a telescope.  In macro mode, it will focus down to objects actually touching the lens.  Or you can crank it up to a 50 power zoom.  It takes excellent movies under a wide variety of conditions.  Image stabilization makes it seem like your handheld home movies are taken from a professional camera dolly.  It takes pictures without flash in conditions so dark that I could not see the subject at all.  With the built-in image stabilization, it is capable of taking handheld pictures that rival the sharpness of a large format view camera on a tripod.But if you just want an easy to operate camera for good snapshots, you should look for a simpler camera.

A few years ago, I bought a Canon digital Elph (S330) just for some everyday digital point-n-shooting.  While the Elph has served me well, I find the lack of manual settings too limited for my taste.  If I were to upgrade to a DSLR, I would get either the Canon 1Ds or the 5D (both of which carry full-frame sensors, a requirement for me), but I'm just not prepared to spend $2,500 for the 5D or 3x that for the 1Ds yet.With the recent addition of my family (a new baby), I started to look into buying a replacement for the Elph so I can take more baby photos.  The film SLR takes great pictures, but traveling with 3 lbs+ of photo equipment is just not practical.  I needed something compact (not necessarily pocket sized), but gives me the options to take pictures on manual settings like an SLR.  I did quite a bit of research, and determined the Canon S3 IS would be the best camera for my purpose.  I've used it for the past month, and it's been great!  It's shaped like an SLR, only smaller.  It has most, if not all, of the manual settings of a full-size DSLR, minus the interchangeable lenses and an optical viewfinder.  Obviously, with an EVF camera like the S3 IS you gain live preview capability, movie mode, and the absence of sensor dust issue.  The live histogram is also a huge advantage over competitor models.  With a long-zoom and image stabilization, the S3 IS is priced at a fraction of a DSLR.  While nobody should expect the same picture quality out of the S3 IS as a DSLR, especially at high ISO, this is truly a great camera for photo enthusiasts who are just not ready to buy a DSLR, or DSLR owners looking for a more compact digicam for traveling or everyday work.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Since my work requires photography, I'm very picky and only used to professional cameras.  I've always hated non-SLR digital  cameras because of slow response times, slow shutter speeds, noisy/grainy image quality, and just the hassle of not being able to see my actual shot through the viewfinder.  On the other hand, I was tired of carrying around all my heavy bags and lenses every time I just wanted to shoot some fun shots for myself.  So, I decided to buy something lighter with a fixed lens just for snapshots, and live with the compromises.I had a hard time deciding between this and the A640, but chose this for the zoom and the extra creative features, even though it is not as compact and the pictures not quite as sharp.Well, let me tell you, this little camera is not much of a compromise at all!  I've been extremely impressed with both the performance and the handling.  The features are simple to learn and use and photos are much better than the test photos I saw online.  In fact, the chromatic aberration / fringing problem inherent in these compact zooms has not been a problem in any of my pictures, so far, and the color and image quality are very impressive. The camera is fast - not as fast as an SLR, but sure faster than any of the other digtial point-and-shoots I've tried.  The unlimited continuous shooting mode, which is perfect for catching fast-action sports shots, solves the problem of slow shutter speeds and is not found in any of the other camera's in the S3's class.  I've also been very surprised by the functionality of the EVF (electronic view finder).  I've never used one and was prepared to dislike it, but I actually love it. Since the \"real\" viewfinders in non-SLR's don't show the actual shot, you can't really use them to hold your eye up against, which helps to steady the camera during zoom shots.  I assumed the EVF, with it's low resolution, would be dificult to see through and too annoying to use, but it's not at all.  The picture, though a bit fuzzy, is easily used to frame the shot and it makes the camera function almost like an SLR. So, far, I have never found the EVF difficult to see through and now that I've used it, I'm glad it has this feature.  The camera is also much lighter weight to use than it seemed in the store.  Yes, it's heavier than the smaller compacts, but it's still very light compared to an SLR and I barely notice it when I'm hiking along.The bottom line is, this is a fast, fully-featured, easy to use little camera that takes fabulous pictures and has more going for it than any of the other long-zoom compact digitals on the market.  The quality of the photos is what has surprised me the most - they really are very good.  I would not hessitate to recommend this camera to anyone looking for a point-and-shoot with a few more features and a good zoom.  If you don't care about the zoom, fast sports shots, or better movie mode, I'd recommend the Canon A640 or A630.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "This camera dominates this price range", "Author": "M.

This camera is more than enough for what I need, but when it comes to detail, resolution, and color clarity, you can never really have too much.And I am NOT a camera techy, as many of the reviewers on this camera seem to be.  However, with that said, and with all of the features this camera has, the functionality of this camera became VERY intuitive after just a few hours of referencing the manual and working directly with the camera.Another thing I want to point out is the bundle this camera is packaged with.  Personally, I give Canon a great deal of credit for making this package.  The 16MB SD card it comes with is NOT useless!  It is perfect for grabbing the camera right out of the box and putting in the batteries (4 included!), and giving it a whirl.  I know 16 MB is very little space, but slow down------it's not a \"scam\" to get you to buy more and more products, or to spend $600 when you thought you were only going to spend $350 on your new camera, etc.  Yes, you will want a bigger card---of course you will!  But this package gives you another opportunity to save more money, and to expand your options on your own personal terms.  I can only imagine if the camera was bundled with a 1GB stick that people would complain about the size or quality or the rise in price, etc.No, it doesn't come with a carrying bag either.  But do you determine what golf club to buy based on wether or not it comes with a sleeve/cover?I have the lens adapter/converter to 58mm and the lens hood as well, and I am definitely glad I purchased them all together.NOTE-----I HIGHLY reccomend also buying a UV filter for the camera, if for no other reason than protecting the lens.  You will be much more nervous and meticulous if you have to clean the camera's own lens rather than a filter.I can't argue much about the technical specifics of cameras, etc, but the setup on this camera was a breeze.  I plugged the A/V cable into my TV, and there it was----stereo sound from the movie I had just recorded, no messy setup, and immediate results.  Easy!  It even functioned to display the viewfinder contents on the TV itself when in camera mode, which was a nice surprise if nothing else!For my two cents, if you are looking for better quality pictures but, like me, you are NOT a techy or a professional photographer, and your budget is NOT $9000 (there IS a guide on Amazon for a $9000 budget), I recommend this camera to you.  The camera DOES look like a big, complicated mess and it can certainly be intimidating.  But you probably thought the same thing when you first started to drive a car.  By now, you don't have to put too much effort into driving your car, and this camera quickly became as familiar and intuitive to me as well.  And the results speak for themselves----the pictures are remarkable, and every time a friend sees a movie clip I have taken with this camera they smile and laugh and often tell me how surprised they are that a camera can do all of that.

A. Kane", "ReviewID": "R9XIOQIGDIAFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I write martial arts books, most of which require numerous illustrations and photographs to help readers understand and perform the various techniques. After years of spending thousands of dollars per book with professional photographers, I finally decided to purchase a high-end camera so that I could do the shots myself. I needed something simple enough that I could hand it over to an assistant who would take the pictures, yet good enough to produce professional quality results. Ease of use, powerful optical zoom, and superior picture quality were my main requirements.After weighing the options I decided to go with this model. For about what I would have spent on a mid-range digital SLR by itself I was able to invest in not only this camera, but also two 1 GB memory cards, a dozen rechargeable batteries, a padded hard case, a tripod, a complete lighting package, and a backdrop with stand. The whole set-up ran roughly $1,600. Since the highest resolution photos use up about 3.5 MB apiece, it is good to invest in a couple of large capacity, high speed memory cards. The batteries last for several hundred shots if you use the viewfinder so a couple of sets with a high-speed recharger ought to do for most applications. The cannon soft case isn't all that great so I decided to spend a few bucks more on a good hard case to protect the camera and accessories.I am very happy with this investment. The camera performs admirably. Indoor pictures are clean and clear, even without the fancy lighting. I took a few test shots using the built-in \"indoor\" setting which compensates for fluorescent lights. They turned out remarkably well. With the extra lighting the indoor photos go from remarkably good to absolutely great. Outdoor shots on \"auto\" and \"sports\" modes work very well too, with or without a tripod stand. It's not quite as fast as an SLR, of course, but takes multiple shots with adequate timing for my needs. The manual adjustments work well if you're well versed in photography and know what you're doing. I've found that the pre-set modes meet such a wide variety of applications that I don't need to tweak things manually all that often. The only major feature that I have not tried yet is the movie mode. Since I have a good digital camcorder too, however, I'll probably never need it.The only serious drawback I have found so far is the viewfinder, which is a bit hard to see through in direct sunlight. Worse yet, the flip screen is nearly impossible to read in bright light too, even with the contrast turned-up. Similarly in very dark settings it's quite challenging to aim properly. The photos turn out quite well but I have found that I have to take several shots to frame things properly. Not a huge deal for what I'm doing since I bought all the fancy lighting, but something to consider if you plan to take a lot of shots in bright sunlight or darkness. As others have pointed out, there are no filters available for this model though there is an adaptor to add other lenses which could be filtered.I purchased the 3.2MP S1 IS years ago so adjusting to this new model's features was a breeze. They are not identical, of course, but the layout is quite similar. It's fairly intuitively obvious too. I have actually read the manual and have concluded that this camera has way more functionality than I could ever imagine needing. It's nice to know that it should last for years to come without need for another upgrade though. It is so simple to use that just about anyone can take good pictures using the built-in settings straight away. It is also very easy and quick to download files to the PC for storage or further processing. If you've got Windows XP it's truly plug and play (no praying or special software necessary).All in all, this camera is exactly what I needed. Great quality, reliable pictures at a reasonable price.

I also had gotten used to some conveniences from point-and-shoot digital cameras that I thought I'd lose out on by going SLR.There were other cameras I had considered, especially from my old favorite brands, Olympus and Fuji.  But the closest contenders were the S3's predecessor, the S2, and the Panasonic Lumix FZ7.The Panasonic was making a hard sell: same optical zoom, similar if not better performance in speed tests, similar reviews regarding color and overall quality of their photos.  And, really, the Panasonic was tremendously less expensive and featured a Leica lens, which made the brand-whore in me a little excited.  But the final blow:  The Panasonic seemed to have a goofy rechargable battery system, which is great if you have replacement batteries of the same type, but not so great if you're travelling.  The S3, on the other hand, uses regular AAs.  That meands I can use rechargeables as I like, or get some Duracells. On the road, that's important: I can't worry about whether I packed a charger, an extra battery or if the voltage is going to be alright in the country I'm in.  The other big factor, the trademark Canon swivel-mount LCD display, was critical to my decision.  I love having one on my Canon DV camcorder, especially when I'm taking overhead action in a crowd (or just trying to get a better view of the stage at a show!).  And it beats the heck out of trying the classic hey-let's-point-the-camera-at-ourselves-and hope-it-works-self-portraiture technique.  Just turn the LCD around toward the lens and, as long as you avoid looking to the side at yourself while taking the actual photo, it works like a charm.  And just as your lens should have a cap, the LCD screen tucks away to protect it from fingerprints and grit that can mar it just as easily as the lens.So, moving away from the Panasonic, I had seriously looked at an S2, since most reviews had talked about the S3 not being much of an upgrade from that model.  After some consideration, I decided that the LCD of the S2 was a little too small (though the S3, with a slightly larger screen, is no prize-winner in that arena either) and the additional resolution of the S3 would help with zooming and cropping on otherwise too-wide shots.  But the real reason I chose the S3 is much more shallow: the black S3 passes off much more like a professional camera than the silver-toned S2, which screams pocket camera.  I really think that makes a difference at an event-- you'll get more cooperation from folks if you look a bit more on-the-job, than just a groupie taking snapshots.So far, I have not been disappointed.  The thing that makes me most happy about my decision, especially in the way of not having gone the SLR-route, is that going fully-automatic with the camera doesn't fail to come out with great images.  I'm no pro, but I've got some sense of what I'm doing photographically.  I've played with a lot of the settings and going manual when I have had the chance, but at least 80% of the time, letting the camera's auto mode do the work comes up with the best shots.  And when I'm taking quick shots at a crowded event with no chance to mess with settings, that always makes me happy.  And I've only replaced the batteries once, and the second set is still going strong after a few weeks--I suspect the batteries in the box didn't have much to them.My only two real complaints at the moment: the small, but awkward dimensions and the color compared to my old pocket camera.  The size of the camera is actually a plus; it's smaller than an SLR--with or without the lens attached--and can easily be \"palmed\" with one hand without feeling like it's going to slip.  On the other hand, I've never had a harder time trying to find a nice camera bag that wasn't too snug (the lens barrel with cap can make most \"digital camera cases\" fit much too tightly to be of any convenience or protection) or too roomy (even the smallest SLR bags are too big and DV camera bags a little too compartmentalized or too \"secure\" with multiple zippers and flaps).  Because of that, I just place it in my satchel with the rest of my stuff and hope for the best.As for the color: I feel like everything I've shot so far has been okay, but comparing the color produced by the S3 versus my old cheap Fujis (the last being an A303 or my brother's current F470) reveals a big gap.  Under good, naturally-lit conditions, the colors from the Fuji cameras always come out bright and deliciously saturated.  The Canon's seem true enough, but muted and almost dull relative to my old photos.  It's nothing that makes me disappointed, and perhaps I can play a little more with what I'm doing in sunlight, but I would love it if I could get flowers to look as beautiful or kids at play look as full of life without even trying.All in all, it's everything I wanted it to be in a semi-pro camera, and the LCD and battery features have already shown their worth. Until I make the plunge into a nice digital SLR, I'm really glad that I made this my latest camera.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent compromise between point-and-shoots & DSLR", "Author": "P. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R2P9ULC585H0I3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I am not any kind of expert in photography, I am writing this review just as a means to highlight a few features of this camera that really impressed me. Ages ago, I used to own and use an SLr, but for at least the last 20 years I have worked only with point-and-shoots, first film and them digital. My most recent digital was a Canon Powershot S510, and that experience helped convince me to go with Canon again when upgrading.My reasons for picking this over some others that were similar:- I already have lots of SD cards from my previous Canon Powershot, so I wanted to preserve the investment. The Sony I looked at, for example, would have required me to reinvest in new media.- Use of AA batteries; I will not consider a camera that uses proprietary batteries- Quality (i.e. similar to digital camcorder specifications in resolution and frame rate) movie mode with zoom that works while shooting the movie.- Ability to add decent auxillary lenses.- A good zoom with wide range.Some favorable things I have found out or otherwise experienced since buying the camera:- The zoom plus digital image stabilization works well together. I can zoom across two rooms and read 12-point text from a memo on the wall.- The add-on lenses (my experience is limited to the WC-DC58A Wide Angle lens) snap on quickly rather like an SLR, although the original lens does not come off, rather the aux lens just surrounds the original and puts the new optics out in front. However, I was a bit disappointed that the wide angle with the aux lens on is only slightly wider than with it off. At least this aux lens is only about $30 street price and it does help a little bit. In order to add on any of the aux lenses, you need to buy the (also inexpensive) Lens Adapter & Hood kit LAH-DC20. By the way, with the hood attached, the affects of glare when shooting outdoors are eliminated.- The camera allows a WAV format sound file to be recorded for any picture or pictures and stored to the memory card; this is useful for later identification of pictures and what is in them. The sound files are separate from the picture files, but share the same file name with a different extension (e.g. 00001.JPG & 00001.WAV). This is very useful.- The camera has a separate movie button that starts & stops the recording of movies. It works at any time regardless of picture taking mode, so you can start a video while in the middle of taking still pictures, or you can take a still picture(s) while recording a video. The video is recorded at the specified video settings and the still picture is taken at the specified photo settings, so one does not influence the other.- The combination of mini-LCD 'optical' viewfinder (for privacy or shooting outdoors in bright light) and the swivel type main LCD viewfinder is unbeatable. The main LCD would be larger without the swivel feature, but I think it is a good trade-off.- All controls are very ergonomic in appearance, placement and functionality.- The built in flash is pretty good, but for a modest extra cost you can get the optional slave flash unit, which goes off when the primary flash does, and it covers a much larger area.", "Date": "November 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wow!!

It got frustrating for me because I would see pictures other people would take and I couldn't understand why I couldn't take the same type of pictures.  I looked and every photographer who's pictures I enjoyed (on Flickr, Blogspot, etc) were using Canon's.  I've always thought that Canon's (for single image photography) were out of my league as a hobby photographer, but I wanted to take pictures of plants, trees, various things around me which I believe is interesting.  So I did my research comparison shopped and picked this Camera.It is amazing.This camera has so many bells and whistles, but each one is there for a specific reason.  One of the features I use a lot is the SCN function.  It tells the camera the type of environment you'll be shooting in, beach, snow, indoors, foliage, etc etc etc.The video this camera does is almost as good as the video on my actual Canon video recorder, the picture is a nice size with minimal compression so if you edit it with Windows Movie Maker you don't have the annoying (and very amature-ish) compression boxes.Another nice feature is the color change, I love taking photos outdoors in black and white, with my old camera I had to use a software program to change the image to B&W;, with this camera you can do it right then and there, and still have the original color image as well.The Image Stabilizer works very well, and I shake like a leaf in a strong wind storm.  I found that when using the zoom it's best to use 2 hands (which I never did before, like I said amature no photography training) and the shots come out great without having to use the flash.I'm sure as I take more pictures, and do more research and study to improve my photography I'll be changing the ISO & shutter speed to meet my needs, otherwise this is exceeding my expectations and making me look like I am a better photographer than I really am.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super nice camera", "Author": "D.

Resolution is just fabulous.  I originally wanted a compact camera that I could fit in my pocket to take places where an SLR is just too big and cumbersome.  At first I was looking at the Leica D-Lux 2.  But I found it too small for my large hands and fingers.  Also the Leica is so smooth that it is sort of slippery to hold.  The Canon does not have as high a resolution but is certainly acceptable, it is bigger which means it only fits in big pockets, but it has a nice grip.  It is quite comfortable. The flash is not super powerful, but it is adequate and comparable to other cameras with built-in flashes.  It is good for about 15 feet. Oddly enough you have to flip the flash up yourself but I don't consider it an issue.  Outdoor photos are spectacular.  I bought a 1 gb card for it and am quite happy.  Battery life seems good too.My only complaint is not even really a complaint.  There are so many features packed into the camera that it takes a significant amount of time to traverse the menus.

Normally, I'd take my 5D DSLR, but a hand injury dictated a much lighter camera.  When I bought it, I thought I'd really compromised on image quality.Having looked over the 300 shots worth keeping from the 900 I took, I have to say that the compromise in quality was very small indeed.  I took a large number of low light shots on manual setting in the glorious Saint-Chapelle.  Virtually every one came out a winner. I got the best shot I have ever taken of the circular stained glass on the west side of Notre-Dame.  I got great causal shots of families relaxing in the Place de Vosges.  And the IS on full telephoto shots in Puligny-Montrachet showed no shake at all.I do wish that the camera supported RAW.  And manual seems to take the resolution down by one notch, although I am still researching the user guide.That said, for $500 you get almost DSLR camera quality which is easy to carry, easy to hold, and a joy to take shots with.

I have a full video and reasonably good snaps of the Disney parade during the evening darkness (switch to highest ISO with the dedicated ISO button) with:1. Amazingly low jerkiness due to the image stabilization. The IS here is of course better than the S1IS.2.

The S3 fits that description.As multiple reviews here and elsewhere have indicated, the video function on the S3 surpasses all the still cameras on the market today (as of late 2006).  We're not talking professional quality here, but it should be enough for anyone who shoots short segments (under 10 mins.) just for fun and doesn't need a full fledged camcorder.As someone who's owned a dozen different cameras since the 80s, my reaction to the photo abilities of the S3 is a mixed bag.On a recent shoot I experienced two minor problems in terms of color reproduction.  In one shot the white in a woman's sweater (which was all off-white) was so degraded that the texture became blurred and flat.  In another shot the setting sun caught a woman's face and created another blurred effect.  In both situations the shutter speed was fast enough to prevent blur and the image quality was set to high.I'm not saying this is a terrible camera.  I love using my S3.  It's a really fun camera to use.  But the cold hard reality is that my recently purchased 35mm Olympus IS-2 (which cost me about $40 used) can still run circles around the S3 in terms of picture quality and speed.  In the time it takes the S3 to take one shot and be ready for the next my \"new\" 35mm Olympus can take three.I mention these flaws because these are what I considered the trade offs of purchasing this specific camera for its video capabilities.If you're not going to use the video function then I would strongly recommend a different camera with a better image censor and faster speed.  I recommend anyone concerned with these issues, especially image sensor ability which is more important than megapixels at this point, to check out imaging-resource dot com.  That site shows how each camera handles low light and ISO settings, image sensor abilities and other issues.Minus the lack of true image stabilization, the Fujifilm FinePix S6000fd is one camera that they show to be clearly superior to the Canon in terms of picture quality.  The lack of IS might be a deal breaker for some.  The IS on the S3 is superb.  Buyers just have to weigh their preferences and decide what they need the most.  For some the S3 will be the best choice, for others it won't.Edit:The 800 ISO on the S3 is extremely grainy and would be only useful in the most dire situations.  It's not for everyday use.  The ISO 400 is passable, but of low quality.  For the best quality, especially if you plan to do any enlargements above 4x6, ISO 200 or lower is necessary.The lack of a RAW option on this type of camera is almost meaningless.  If you require RAW then you're already looking at an SLR.The wide and tele adapters are a great option, but the Canon made versions might not be the best choice.  I picked up a Raynox tube adapter (an adapter is necessary for any converter or filter, regardless of brand) and .66 converter for less than one hundred thirty bucks - great quality and cheaper than Canon.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superior all-in-one choice!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2GNVTO1O2S2U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Powershot S3 is a good choice for those needing an extended zoom range, but wishes to avoid the cost and bulk of Digital SLR designs.The S3 has a very fine, 12x optical zoom, that is quiet, smooth and quick.  The stabalizer comes in very handy for still shots, and is a must for video.The 6 megapixel images are clean and above average.  Try to avoid higher ISOs on any of the compact cameras, but if you must, Canon's new 6MP sensor/processor combination is good.Camera operation works well in the various automatic modes, and is also easy to control manually (except for manual focus).  The eyelevel LCD is good, but everyone seems to have a different opinion on what looks good here.  The rotating back LCD makes easy work of high level, low level or table-top copy work.Video is unsurpassed in this type of camera.  Stereo sound really gives this one a dimension that others lack.  You can also easily switch on the fly.  In the still modes, you can just push the button on the back to instantly start a video.  During this video, you can instantly override the video, and take a still, then is picks back up on the video (it does, however, interrupt the video).I won't revisit all the advantages of SLRs here.

It is easily the most versatile piece of photographic equipment I have ever owned, and I grew up using film SLRs.  This camera has almost all of the features I love in SLR cameras, including fairly intuitive control over exposure settings.  I also love the video feature.My favorite features are:- The 12x zoom lens which can easily capture close-up subjects from the opposite side of a large room.- Super-macro mode shoots clear pictures less than an inch from the lens.- Excellent TV quality video with good stereo sound (no HD).- A variety of shooting modes let you capture a detailed close up in vivid color one moment, and a fast action shot seconds later with the turn of a dial.- Adjustable flash output.That said, there are a few things that really irritate me about this camera.  For instance, the manual focus is a pain to use.  Instead of twisting the lens, you are forced to hold down one button while you press up and down keys.  Autofocus is essentially worthless when you combine low light and fast action (such as a lively concert, like the one I shot pictures at tonight).  A usable manual focus is essential for any serious photographer!Another thing that bothers me is the lack of an external flash hook-up.  It makes it difficult to avoid red-eye when photographing people in low light.I don't understand how such basic features were overlooked when this camera has everything else but the kitchen sink.  While this is certainly the most versatile camera I've ever owned, and I love it for what it is, I would not buy it again.  I would look for a similar camera that includes a twist-lens manual focus and a flash hot-shoe.One more critique - photographs are often unusably grainy with ISO settings at 400+.  You'll want to stick to the 80 - 200 range, if you can.

Not only does it allow self portraits, but you can tilt it up to take ground level photos or tilt it down to take an over your head shot.The video is also great quality, and you can zoom while filming and take still photos.

It fits my hands like a glove.  On a piano, I have about a 10-12 key stretch.4.  I'm techy enough so while a bit overwhelmed with all the options, I can handle them.5.  Loading from the camera to the computer is a snap!6.  The RCA jacks are a hoot, allowing displaying pictures on a t.v. easy and fun.7.

I got some great shots for someone who just replaced her very good Nikon SLR for her first digital camera.The Bad:1.  I only took about 15 pictures before the camera literally just died on me; it wouldn't power on for a third time.  Of course, I tried a couple of different new sets of batteries and the originals should have been fine.2.  Is it black to cover the potentially flimsy plastic body?

Red-eye is pretty bad due to the low flash to the body and the software that comes with the camera, while having the option to \"edit it out\" puts human eyes in; this looks really creepy when your main subject matters are a dog and cat.4.  It is a bit heavy; be prepared.I've looked for a couple of years for the right camera to replace my Nikon 35mm.  The digital camera needed to be:1.  Light2.  Produce good quality pictures (overall)3.  Have good reviews by users, not \"editors.\"  One never knows if a review by an editor is a paid advertisement in disguise.4.

So, I'm asking for a replacement, rather than a refund.  We'll see where this goes from here.The replacement from Amazon came faster than a speeding bullet and worked at first shot (to my delight).  I've used it to take pictures from the car as we passed unimportant things, just to see what it would do.  At 40-45 miles an hour, it freezes signs so read them (one cannot tell they were shot while we were moving).  The ISO setting is high, there's no blur.

And at less than $300, I thought it was a bargain!I immediately took this S3 on vacation with me and it was truly impressive.Pros: A bargain at under $300, optical image stabilizer, uses regular AA batteriesCons: If I think of any, I'll let you knowI've always been a fan of Canon cameras and this camera just blew me away. I had to get it. The 12X optical zoom and the optical image stabilizer was enough to seal the deal: no questions asked. The bonus was the weight, the fact that it takes normal AA NIMH batteries rather than the proprietary battery. Added bonus was the flash stays off unless you flip the flash unit up and the camera is nearly silent when you turn off the sounds. This makes taking pictures in places you're not normally supposed to take pictures super easy! I like the view finder when shooting outdoors and the swivel color LCD display is nice too. Little things like the review mode work well and the camera goes from off to shutter release in less than 2 seconds, making it possible to get all those pictures you would normally miss with the earlier generation point and shoot cameras. I can't tell you how pleased I am with this camera. After taking nearly 8 gigabytes worth of pictures, I can't blame the camera for a single bad shot. In fact, many shots came out much better than I imagined. My old Canon would not have been able to take them at all, while the S3 was amazing!So far, I've been impressed with how fast and easy the camera is and that I'm able to take usable pictures in conditions my old Canon would not have worked at all. Add to this that the image quality is absolutely stunning! The colors are vivid and sharp, the lens has a 12X zoom, which means you can get stable clear shots from a far distance and you won't need to lug around a tripod.Did I mention that the video mode on this camera is also amazing? Yes, it shoots at various resolutions and frame rates and records audio in stereo. The image stabilizer also works in video mode and you can zoom while recording. It almost makes having a separate video camera unnecessary. Unlike the older Canons, video are not limited in length: you can shoot until your card is full.Like I alluded to earlier, the reason I love this camera so much is that I can go into museums and other places where taking pictures is either difficult or impossible and the S3 snaps amazing pictures so fast, no one even knows you're taking pictures. While other people are snapping pictures and their flash has to go off, the S3 whips out a dozen shots with no flash, no annoying shutter sound and no one even knows! It was also quite easy to hand the S3 to nearby strangers to take a snapshot of you without having to explain how to use it. It is just that natural to use.Battery life was very good. I brought 20 NIMH 2000ma batteries and a set of 4 lasted a day and a half. I replaced a set of 4 each day so I never had had to worry about the batteries dying on me.Ok, convinced yet? I didn't mention that the S3 can take amazing shots at 0 inches from the lens and that you can override all the settings and you can edit movies and a bunch more things. I'm sure it can do things I don't even know about yet, since I've had the camera only 3 weeks. I never used any of the numerous modes other than Auto and P)rogram mode. While on my trip, I noticed that many people had the S2 or the S3 and they all really liked theirs. And while I'm writing this, the S5 has been announced.

I read shining upon shining review, but didn't do a Google search for specific S3 IS defects, problems, etc.  Big mistake.I ordered the S3 from Amazon and the problems began as soon as I took it out of the box.  There was something loose and moving around inside the camera, I went online and saw that several other S3 owners had the exact same problem.I put the batteries in to test the camera, and it seemed to be working okay, until I transferred some test images to my PC.  I have been taking photos for 20+ years and I do not take crooked shots - some of the pictures were without doubt slanted to the left.  I googled and found other S3 owners complaining of the same problem, which seems to be a factory defect - the CCD is misaligned.Next problem I found was terrible color fringing, also known as chromatic aberration.  In areas where there was light/dark contrast, violet and green lines were seen along the entire length.Other issues I noticed about the S3 and read about from owners:Focus problems, bad low light abilities, clicking sounds from the lens, mushy buttons, barrel distortion, redeye, plastic tripod mount, 1GB movie limit regardless of memory card size, and a cheap lens cap that can come off too easily.  Some users used their S3 to take dozens of pictures, and had memory card errors wipe out all their photos; this was not due to faulty memory cards.I'm not a professional photographer, and did not buy the S3 expecting professional quality photos - but these are problems one might expect to encounter with a $99 camera, not a $300+ model, and not from a trusted Canon.The name Canon always meant quality to me.  Unfortunately things have changed and companies are cutting back on their build quality and quality control to cut costs.  Because of this brands that used to be the best, are now pumping out some of the worst products ever.Some S3 owners have no complaints, it seems you have to get lucky, if I want to gamble I'll go to Vegas.  It's frustrating that I now have to go and find another comparable camera to replace the S3.  One owner told of his journey to several stores to test different S3's.  In over a dozen tests, only one of them had none of these issues.Although I love the features, and got a few decent shots with it, I cannot accept all the faults.

I have one other Canon A85 digital still camera, a Sony f717 and a Sony f828, a Nikon d50 and I know I will be using the s3 IS more then any of them.  It's small, sharp pictures, as well as movie clips make this a real winner.  I owned the s1 IS for a year and thought it was a great camera, my only complains were poor low light focusing, shutter lag, and no hot shoe.  Well the s3 IS fixed two out of the three. Focus is much better and lag is almost none, very fast! They also added a lot of bells and whistles to this thing like color swap and color accent. (You can look on canonusa.com to see what these are.)

IF you don't wear glasses!", "Author": "Jim Dee", "ReviewID": "RG1SZH6Q36FBG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've taken a couple of thousand pictures with this camera and the results are generally very good.  One serious flaw, however, is its electronic viewfinder. I wear glasses and the viewfinder is difficult (sometimes VERY difficult) to see in many outdoor lighting situations. (Of course the LCD screen is equally useless in bright light).  If I take off my glasses so my eye can fit snuggly against the viewfinder, the view is fine.  But if you wear glasses for distance, you know that taking your glasses off each time you want to shoot is not a reasonable option.  Of course, this is a problem with optical viewfinders, too, but the problem is not nearly as severe.  So, I would strongly advise those who wear glasses to test the camera thoroughly in a variety of lighting conditions before buying.I will get to the good points in a moment, but another annoying, though not so serious, flaw is the setup for using shutter speed (and aperture) priority.  The shutter speed is set using the four-way controller, located in the top right corner on the camera back.  The problem here is that there is no way to select a shutter speed and lock it.  Because of the position of the four-way controller, it is very easy to push it accidentally, while simply holding the camera between shots, which changes the shutter speed.  This means being very careful how you hold the camera and checking the shutter speed before each shot to be sure it has not been changed.  The shutter speed is displayed in the viewfinder, but the aforementioned problem with the viewfinder makes this problem doubly irritating for us glasses wearers.Having said all that, I still like this camera.  It has great flexibility, and operations are fast, smooth and quiet.  The pictures are excellent.  The rotating LCD is very useful, allowing the camera to be placed in positions where using the viewfinder is impossible.  The IS is helpful, though some physical stability (tripod, tree, post ..) is still needed at the longer end of the telephoto range.  The flash is OK, though red eye is definitely a problem.  I've experimented with a few of the special modes and some worked well, while others did not. Selecting setting manually is often better.There's a sizable learning curve with this camera, because of the numerous buttons, the many special shooting modes, and various options available.  I still have much to understand, but the more I learn the more I like the camera, in spite of the problems discussed above.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great \"have it all\" camera!", "Author": "Peter Sinclaire", "ReviewID": "R33F9ZD0TR42BV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an Olympus user... having had a C3040 and then a C5050. However, I always felt that the 3x zoom was way too short compared to what you get used with video cameras. On the other hand, when I dropped my old 35mm SLR camera and accesories because it was mostly sitting at home due to its enormous size and weight, I promised myself that I will never have a camera that I can't carry in my belt. Thus, the digital SLRs are of no advantage to me, no matter the image quality... I hope sometime in the future, some clever manufacturer will finally create the perfect SLR: one the size of a point and shoot camera but with optical SLR viewfinder and tiny interchangeable lenses, if one needed to. Not too difficult... but they still need to sell all those big lenses before they commit to a new micro SLR design.So, while I wait, I found that an image stabilized long zoom camera was a perfect interim product. I chose the Canon IS S3 for its good reviews, size and overall Canon quality. Olympus, one of the first in bringing optical image stabilization years ago with the UZ 2000, had in the meantime abandoned it and all their long zoom series had no stabilization. A long zoom without stabilization is going to produce more frustration than excitement, especially when those lenses are hardly brighter than F/3.5 at the long end.So, I was tempted by the IS S3, though I bought it just after it came in the market in May, so I paid more than $100 than today's price. This is the cost of buying oven-warm products. I knew it and I assume it. However, I must say that I am really happy with the camera. I am still learning how to take advantage of all the features it has, while you can be happy most of the time with just the auto point and shoot mode. I admit that the image noise is a bit higher than my old C5050, at same ISO values, something I expected from a camera with such a small sensor. But the advantage of the 12x zoom compensates more than enough.To carry this camera you need to get the Canon pouch (PSC-75). It is the only one that tightly fits, and I really tried two dozens or more of the generic ones. It just fits the camera (and its strap if you use it on your belt) and looks very much like the old 35mm SLR cases, that you can just leave hanging from the camera while in use if it is not in your belt. If you take extra batteries, put them in your pocket... though for one day shooting you don't need them.Image quality is excellent for this type of camera. I uploaded some images that shows it, plus an example of the My Colors mode wich is a nice addition from Canon: it is like having Photoshop in camera... but you don't need to go to college to use it. And for the zoom, an image of the moon with a 1.7x Olympus converter shot handheld looks terrific! 1/160s at 730mm I never imagined I could. (check it in uploaded pics).Some people complain about the flash not popping up automagically. I love it! Now I don't even need to look for the flash sign in the display. When I want flash, I just pop it up. If I want to make sure it will stay off, fold it down. Just keep the flash setting to forced.The macro is tricky to use. When using the full zoom, you can focus a field of view of about 8cm wide from a distance of 1 meter. Not bad if you want to stay away from your subject. But to get real macro, you have to get very, very close... The zoom has to be in wide, and at 10cm from the lens you get around 6cm wide, at 5cm it is 4cm wide, and at 0cm (yes, you can focus on something touching the lens surface) you get 2.5cm wide.. enough to duplicate and old 35mm slide.Well, I am not talking about all the features that have been described in detail by so many people. I just want to say that I miss the flash hot shoe and low noise of my C5050. In return I get a great stabilized zoom and really fast reaction camera. I still keep the C5050 for my underwater shooting when diving.", "Date": "September 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS - AMAZING!!!", "Author": "K. K.

But, since I wrote a glowing review of another Canon camera model (the A620), fairness almost demanded a less positive review where equally warranted.Like a previous reviewer, I also returned the Canon S3 IS recently purchased. And, just like that other reviewer, a significant reason was the small LCD display. I found it nearly impossible to use without reading glasses - not an obvious issue until actually using it in the \"real world.\" Of course, the Canon A620 has the same small display, but one is more willing to overlook an annoyance such as this in a product costing considerably less. But, with a camera costing as much as the Canon S3 IS, there is little excuse today for such a small display (indeed, several other cameras in this price range offer a larger display).Regardless, if this were the only issue with the Canon S3 IS, it might have been possible to live with this annoyance as well. But, added to that, the overall quality of this camera bothered me. Some aspects of the camera, such as the plastic tripod mount, suggests cheap construction. I seriously doubt a plastic mount can survive the repeated punishment of the often sharp metal screws found on the typical camera tripod. Plastic into plastic, perhaps. Metal into metal, of course. But not metal into plastic. Canon should know this, but went ahead with the plastic anyway. Since I use a tripod often (anyone seeking good images should), this annoyance was a little more difficult to ignore. But, moreover, this got me thinking about the rest of the camera. If Canon was so willing to cut corners with a plastic tripod mount, one has to wonder how far they went to cut corners in places consumers cannot easily see - the electronics and mechanics inside the camera.There were other minor disappointments (weak flash, noisy EVF, and so on), but I could reasonably live with those. None, including the above, were enough to cause me to utterly rule out the Canon S3 IS. The early reviews of the newer Sony DSC-H5 were the final straw. A look at the features, and a trip to the store to actually handle the camera, was enough to finally cause me to switch.The Sony offers an additional 1.2 million pixels of image resolution (even if one doesn't make larger prints, the extra resolution gives more room for cropping images), a larger LCD display, a better EVF, a metal tripod mount, a stronger flash, and more. It also performs better at ISO-400, offering another full stop of usable exposure over the Canon S3 IS (important to me during the long dark winters of northern Europe, but a benefit to anyone shooting in low-light conditions). The Sony doesn't perform exceptionally well at the larger ISO settings (ISO-800 and 1000), but neither does the Canon (no ISO-1000 setting, but similar performance at ISO-800). Otherwise, both the Sony and Canon are pretty evenly matched - little else gained or lost by chosing one over the other. I did lose the articulating display offered on the Canon S3 IS, but, more importantly, gained significantly in the other areas mentioned in this paragraph.Like the other reviewer, perhaps a future Canon S(?) IS camera addressing these issues might tempt me to return to the Canon fold.

Before the Canon I owned a Minolta Z6, and though both cameras' tech specs are similar, the Canon is far superior. I decided to migrate to S3 IS because of the Minolta's shortcomings, such as poor battery life, terrible handling of contrast, oversaturation of reds and bad white balance. As far as I can tell, the S3 has none of these problems. I was also worried about the learning curve -- changing brands can be daunting and difficult -- but the Canon is very intuitive and easy to set and handle, plus it offers tons of options to get it to do exactly what you want. It is also fantastic in low light conditions (as good as the Olympus C2100 UZ). The 12x optical zoom and image stabilization are fantastic.

It won't freeze subject motion, but it does a very good job of freezing camera motion.  One of my first low-light hand-held shots has a blurry subject (he moved while talking) with a rock-solid background and foreground.  This feature makes everyone a better photographer.The lens is near professional quality.  It's bright at f 2.8 (wide) and f 3.5 (telephoto) so you can shoot available light as well as long zoom.  The brightness also means you can lock the camera on ISO 80 or 100 to keep highest image quality.  The image stabilizer means that you can use the really long zoom without camera shake ruining the shot.The sensor has enough pixels to do the job.  Last night I shot full moon shots at max zoom (using a tripod).  The moon was well up in the sky (making it smaller) and looked no bigger than a pencil eraser on the display.  Inside on the monitor, the shots are great.  There are enough pixels that when I crop to get the subject, I still have a very nice shot.  Fall foiliage shots have so much detail you could almost teach a biology class on leaves from your snapshots when you blow them all the way up.  I mught be able to use more pixels, but I don't *need* more pixels.The Auto and Program modes are great for beginners.  Pick it up, turn it on, frame and fire.  Most of the time this will suffice and the quality of the shot will be determined by the eye of the photographer.  Some times you need to take control, and the camera has the modes and controls for that too.  Indoor, low light, no-flash, long zoom is the one that hits me; in default mode the autofocus hunts if you don't help it.  Now I know what to do, but a novice will fight it.The camera has a host of handy features like self timer and continuous fire and red-eye reduction and...  A novice can ignore them but with experience you can exploit them.Like every digital ever made, the display washes out in sun.  The viewfinder can seem cramped if you are used to an SLR.  The rotatable display lets you hold the camera away from your face and get good shots (overhead and from waist level are the most useful).  Shooting from the waist or with the camera in your lap can get you some great candid shots.Love the movie mode.  You'll want a 1G or bigger SD card.It doesn't fit in a pocket, but it is reasonably easy to hold in your right hand.  It is way smaller than an SLR, so you can lurk with it concealed mostly in your hand.  I haven't found a case I really like for it yet.

This is beacuse the camera may automatically selects the highest 'film speed' of ISO=800. This will produce extremely noisy, grainy, or pixelated images. The same problem occurs in Sports mode as well.To avoid this problem, you should manually set ISO=200 or lower, then shoot in 'P' (Programmed mode) instead. Of course, now the exposure time is increased by 4x, so camera shake may be a problem even with image stabilization.If image quality under low light condition is critical to you, your best choice is to upgrade to a digital SLR.[The following section is for geeks only]:In order to explain the root cause of noisy images at high ISO, I have to tell you a secret: the so called 'film speed' for digital camera is a big scam. Unlike film camera world (where a film with higher ISO number means it has higher light sensitivity), the digital camera's optical sensor has a fixed sensitiviity. The signal amplitude from each pixel is proportional to the integral of light intensity and exposure time. To simulate a higher 'film speed' (from 200 to 400, for example), a digital camera simply reduces the exposure time by half (which means the signal amplitude from sensor is reduced by half), then multiply the signal by 2x afterwards. However, noises from the sensor is also multiplied by 2x in this process. That is why images always become 'noisier' at higher ISO number.The problem with noisy images is made worse by the \"mega-pixel arms race\", where camera makers continue to cram more pixels onto the same sensor area. The old S1 has 3.2 mega-pixel on its 10mm by 7.5mm sensor. The new S3 has 6MP in the same area. So the amount of light falling on each S5 pixel is only 50% that for the S1. The S1 can produce reasonably noise-free images at ISO=200. For the S3 sensor to produce the same signal strength, it needs 2X longer exposure time, which means ISO=100. That is why when you shoot the S3 at ISO=800, the noise problem is 8X worse compared to shooting the S1 at ISO=200.The only reliable way to improve signal-to-noise ratio is to increase sensor area. Professional DSLR typically have full-frame sensors (36x24mm, or 10x larger than the sensor in S3). Those can operate up to ISO=1600 or even 3200 and still produce almost noise-free images. Pro-sumer DSLR such as the Rebel XT have samller APS-C sensor (22.5x15mm, or 4x larger than the sensor in S3). So those can only operate satisfactorily up to ISO=800.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does a pretty fair job, but not what I was hoping for", "Author": "Chanda Marx", "ReviewID": "R37I0MLPXO1P4R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my camera for about 2 months now.

These are to include;Trouble with focusing in low light conditions; shadowing on the super macro function; washed out background color (this applies only to my outdoor shots; indoor shots are fine, but my skies in all my outdoor pics are washed out to the point of being white, while the foreground and land in the same picture are almost over-saturated in color).Also, another downside is that you have to manually raise the flash when you need it. I've not found any instructions on a way to make it pop up automatically.

So, I'll start by saying that I am not a professional photographer, nor do I aspire to become one.  This is my second digital camera, I used the first one for 4 years and loved it (a small Sony 3x), got this new camera primarily to take better pictures of my baby (zoom helps!).  I've never owned an SLR - not even a film one.I do, however, enjoy photography immensely and have been reading on it a lot lately.  It was precisely this camera that moved me to try and learn more so that I could take adtantage of all its features.  So, I feel like I definitely grew as a photographer in the half a year or so that I've had this camera.  From this vantage point, I love this camera very much for all the reasons already mentioned - zoom, video, IS, etc.  I whole-heartedly agree with all the rave reviews for those, and I'm a little puzzled as to why people would complain of focus issues - certainly, they happen, as they do on any camera, even an SLR, but I would not call it a problem that should stop you from getting this camera.I really have only 2 real complaints, responsible for the 4 star rating:1) the flash seems to be charging somewhat slowly when it has been fired a few times in a row.  I've missed a few amazing shots waiting for it to recharge, and that really upset me.2) the camera seems to have trouble focusing on skin tones.  Taking close-ups of my sleeping baby have been quite a challenge, and I was really looking forward to those, considering I have a 12x camera.That being said, having explored everything this camera has to offer, I've come to the conclusion that unless I decide to do photography seriously and make money with it, this camera is all I need, and getting an SLR is not only expensive, but really absolutely unnecessary for my needs.  In order to take full advantage of an SLR, you'll need 3 lenses (or an expensive zoom one), a tripod, filters, you name it, and quite frankly, when I compare my pictures with pictures of my friends who own SLRs, very rarely do I see the difference (and they agree).Added after 1 year of use:I recently noticed that if I try to take stills while also making a movie (a feature that a year ago, very few cameras had), every time I take a picture, the screen goes black for a second, and then resumes the movie (and that gets recorded into the movie, so when you're watching your movie, you will have black screen and a clicking noise).  I remember others complaining about it in reviews as well, my camera did not used to do it, so it's some kind of recent malfunction.  I do not take a whole lot of stills during a movie, so it's not a horrible set back for me, definitely not worth investing the money to fix it, but I thought I'd mention it, since it does kill a feature that you pay for.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "This beats the Digital Rebel XT for user friendliness.", "Author": "T.

There are significant artifacts when shooting against a flat sky, and the red and purple fringing is really bad.What is the worst though is the general flatness of the pictures.  I have to boost the contrast in post significantly on almost every photo.  And if you have bright spots in the picture, they're usually blown out.I've taken roughly 2,000 pictures with it, and, when I look at the pictures compared to my 3.2 mp camera... I can scarcely tell the difference!  The color, contrast, and noise level are all better on the OLD camera!Sure... it's easy to use, it has good features, it has lots of bells and whistles... but WHO CARES if the picture quality SUCKS?I bought this camera specifically for the 12x zoom and for the image stabilization.  I was hoping these two things would help with sports photography (particularly nighttime NASCAR races) and with birdwatching.  But because the sensor is so small and requires so much light to get a decent picture, the camera is almost impossible to focus, even with the image stabilization.  The old way... I had good pictures that were really out of focus.  Now, I get crappy pictures that are slightly out of focus.If I had it to do over, I would NOT buy this camera.  I would strongly recommend trying it out first before spending money on it.  There is a new version of this camera out (the S5), but, since the sensor is no bigger, I imagine the pictures won't be any better.  There is some new image processing software, but my guess is that you'll just have 8 million flat, fuzzy, lifeless pixels instead of 6.In case you can't tell, I am extremely disappointed with this camera.  It really makes going out and taking pictures a chore.  Hopefully, when Photoshop Elements 6 for the Mac comes out in March, I'll be able to revive the pictures I have and make this piece of junk work until I can afford something better.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply the Best in it's Class", "Author": "Wise Shopper", "ReviewID": "R17INXY5J8I3TQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are interested in all the specs and opinions about the features of this camera, then refer to digital camera review sites for this camera (such as dpreview.com and steves-digicams.com).

This by far is my favorite one. So many cool features.  It's got the large lense of my Olympus C700, the photo quality of my Nikon D40, and the portability and features (and then some) of my Fuji 5100.  I really prefer to use manual mode so that I can control shutter and aperture.  Took me very little time (about a hundred photos or so) to build a mastery.What I like most so far:- Incredibly high quality photos even at max zoom (including digital zoom)- A high speed continuous shooting mode- Neat flipover LCD screen- A viewfinder that displays exactly what my photos will look like as I compose- Just enough buttons to avoid having to navigate through just one feature screen- Helpful histogram display option- uses 4 AA's; hooray for no proprietary battery- super cool Accent photo mode which will result in a black and white photo but with one color that you preselect still in view (think of a rose bush with only red roses and all backround in shades of gray)The images are terrific.  They thought of everything.  But just to be fair there are a few wish list items.- Viewfinder is a touch smaller than I would like.- Focusing the viewfinder is required more often than I would expect- The camera width is just a bit narrow; an extra half inch on the left side would feel more comfortable in its gripI like that the flash does not pop up automatically.  This keeps from accidental firing in locations where flash is not permitted.  I also found lots of menu choices which give me control over sounds, power timer, etc. easy to navigate.But it's all about the pictures.  No need for extra lenses.  When I need to get close, I just zoom in. There's even a Super Macro mode that gave me some stunning looks at ants on a branch and a bee on a feeder.This is a terrific all around camera.  Even shots taken through windows look clear.  No noticable noise.I recommend it highly (especially now that the price is dropping).

It's been a great camera, but I've grown tired of buying film and making trips to pick up my pictures, organizing negatives, paying for expensive development, etc.  So, a year ago a bought an over-priced pocket size snapshot digital.  Hated it!  It took the worst pictures and had practically nothing for a zoom.  What a waste!  It was back to buying film again.But recently, a local electronics store was going out of business and I kept my eye on this Canon Powershot.  I liked the feel of it in my hand.  It reminded me of my 35mm that I loved so much because I could really put my hands around it.  It felt like a nice piece of equipment.  The price wasn't bad either since I caught it on close out.  The zoom was amazing and once I panned around the store with it and zoomed in on minor detail of items across the sales floor, I was hooked.  Of course, the salesman tried to talk me into some palm-sized plastic toy camera again.  Absolutely not!Unlike most people with a new toy, the first thing I did was sit down and read up on all the cool features this camera presents...snow pictures, fireworks, foliage, portrait, landscape, color swap, black and white, and many many more!  I couldn't wait to test it out.  Since it's Spring time, I ran out to try the foliage setting.  The pictures were amazing!  Next, I snapped pictures of my dogs running in the backyard using a different setting.  Perfection!  I toyed with the flash and took pictures of my roommate.  They were so crisp.  Even better than my 35mm.My two favorite features of this camera are the color swap where you can set the camera to keep only one color in your picture and it will turn the rest black and white.  I paint pictures, so playing around with this setting on a painting I did was a lot of fun.  My second favorite feature is that you can set the camera to take two pictures at once.  It will take the picture the way you set it to take, and then it will also take a plain ole original pic at the same time.  So, let's say you are playing around with the color swap feature but you hate the way those turned out.  You'll still have an original picture with no special setting.  Two pics at once!  And you don't have to set the camera to do this again and again.  You can set it permanently to do this each time you use a specific setting.I was totally turned off to digital cameras thanks to that snapshot piece I had bought, but the Canon PowerShot has definitely changed my mind.  It's the best camera I have ever owned!  I can't stop showing it to my friends, and because of the quality I use it all the time.Definitely worth every penny!  CHECK OUT MY PICTURES!

This camera is my favorite of all because it consistently delivers superior photos. The 12X zoom lens produces sharp pictures throughout its range. Color rendition is excellent. The imaged stabilizer works better than I expected -- I find I can hand hold in many situations where I previously needed to resort to a tripod. I normally print my photos at 8x10 size. I find I can get good prints from the S3's 6-megapixel images even when I crop down to half a frame.The S3 has an wonderful electronic viewfinder that allows you to use the camera as if it were a digital SLR. The viewfinder exactly reproduces what the 2-in. LCD screen on back of the camera would show. I prefer the viewfinder, so I normally leave the LCD screen closed. It's a fine, bright LCD, but with the electronic viewfinder, I just don't need it.Could canon have made this camera better? Yes.

When shopping for camera, I wasn't specifically looking for a camera with a zoom this long-- I thought, foolishly, that it wouldn't matter to me that much. I ended up buying this camera because it was a good price, the zoom seemed nice, and the picture quality I'd seen was good.Then I actually recieved the camera, and realized exactly how much I'd been missing without a good zoom. I can finally get good, closeup shots! My last camera had 3x optical, so the difference was really startling. And even better, the photo quality is really nice. I'm taking a photojournalism class, and when I showed my teacher some of the shots I'd taken, he said \"those shots were taken by that little thing?!\" Also, the image stabilizer is really quite good; if I ever tried to take shots at full zoom on my little Canon Powershot A80, they'd be completely blurry, but with this camera I can shoot at full zoom with barely any blur, even in low light. I was taking pictures at a concert last night, and got some really nice pictures even though it was pretty dark.The only problem I have with it is that it is rather large. I can't cart it around quite as easily as I could my last one. Also, there's tons of tiny buttons all over it, and it took a while before I could find a place to fit my (rather large) hands without pressing them accidentally. However, these aren't huge detractors for me-- I'd rather get good quality pictures and have to deal with the size and the buttons than get cruddy pictures in a tiny camera. Oh, and I really wish they'd provided a wrist strap along with it, but oh well.I've only had this camera for about 3 weeks now (still running on my first set of batteries), so I haven't been able to go through all the neat features on this thing, but I do know that I wouldn't trade this camera for anything else in its price range.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Tough decision S3 vs. A640 / A630", "Author": "shadu-b", "ReviewID": "RZNWMW3PKVA7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My number one reason for purchasing a new camera was dead pixels on my G2.  I've had it for four successful years, but got tired of photoshopping all my pics to conceal the dead spots. :(  The second reason was size.  The G2 is a great camera, but kind of a brick.  And since I travel a lot, I was looking to reduce the bulk in my travel bags.  However, I did not want to lose the full-feature manual controls of the G2.Although I've read good reviews of Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, etc., I love the G2 photo quality, and so to make life easier and narrow the search, I decided right off the bat to stick with Canon.I began my research in the PowerShot A series.  My next requirement was the swivel LCD.  This is such a useful tool for me, especially in crowds where you can raise up the camera and still frame a good shot.  Also with kids, you can lower the camera to your knees and compose without bending over backwards or getting in the dirt.With my primary requirements being swivel LCD, full-feature manual controls, and size constraints, it came down to the A640 and A630.  I read all the reviews, and was simply trying to decide between the 10M with black housing (very slick!) or the 8M which is plenty for me and my 5x7 or 8x10 prints.  I thought that noise would a problem for the 10M A640.  However, the test shots on Digital Camera Resource [...] looked like the A640 slightly outperforms at 400 ISO.  Maybe Canon is test-marketing a new noise reduction system in the camera?In any case, I really liked the less conspicuous black, and decided on the A640.  I went to the camera store (yes, I still prefer to buy from the local shop vs. online) and was disappointed that they don't keep the A640 in stock.  No worries, how about the A630 then.  But while handling the A630, I noticed the S3 IS right there with its sleek black housing, and incredible 12x optical zoom.  I thought for sure this was an $800 camera.  Surprise - same price as the A640.  Now this threw a monkey wrench into my decision!  I had to go back and research everything all over again; now comparing the A640 / A630 to the S3, even looked into the G7.  The G7 lacks a swivel LCD and has a $500 price tag, so it was quickly thrown out.Here's my conclusion on the A640/A630 vs. S3.  Feature for feature, they're basically the exact same camera.  The only exceptions are sensor size, megapixels, zoom with image stabilization (S3), live histogram on the LCD (S3), and of course the bulk or size of the camera itself.  The only other thing I noticed was that the physical controls are slightly different on the A640/A630 vs. the S3.  The button placement on the S3 is more like the G2.Tough decision for me now.  The A630 has everything I need, but the S3 will expand my photography with its amazing 12x zoom.  I knew that if I got the S3, that every time I lugged it out, I would kick myself for not getting the slimmer A630.  And I also knew that if I were to get the A630, then every time I tried to zoom in close, I would kick myself for not getting the 12x S3.Finally, I went to the camera store convinced of my original motivations (size) and determined to purchase the A630.  But when I got in the store, and held the S3 again, it just felt so natural, and the 12x optical zoom simply can't be beat!  I also thought the learning curve would be lower since the controls were laid out more like my G2.  I ended up with the S3, obviously.  That night, I took some shots of the moon, hand-held no tripod, and they are incredible!I know I will still kick myself when I travel and fumble around with the bulkier S3, but I suppose I can always buy the A630 on-line for ~ $250 as a back up.

I use Canon SLR cameras, lenses and equipment which is GREAT stuff. So, when I wanted to add a professional level point-and-shoot camera the Canon Powershot S3 IS was an easy choice. It has  excellent optics and essentially the same technology used in Canon's SLRs. So what could go wrong?First and foremost, everyone should know the Electronic Viewfinder on S3 is VERY pixelated and dark - like looking thru heavy mesh screen. It's difficult to know when you have a sharp focus. Also, the LCD screen is VERY small and dark. It's difficult to see images on this screen in bright light. It simply does not work well for me doing fine art photography. If you plan to use this camera 100 percent of the time in autofocus, these concerns do not apply to you. However, if you plan to do any Macro photography this will be a problem. Personally, I like to know with absolute certainty my photos are sharp and subjects are in focus. No one likes to see fuzzigraphs!I have also found it far too easy to accidently push one of the many buttons scattered over the camera surface. For example, I had set the camera to best quality, highest resolution to shoot flower pictures. Somewhere along the way I hit the wrong button and took a few low resolution images before discovering the change of setting. My SLR's have lots of buttons too, but I've never had this happen before.The macro (close-up)capability of this camera is greatly over-rated. It only works on wide angle settings of the lens. Therefore, you must be VERY close to the subject photographed. I bought a Canon 500D close up lens to take macros and still have the full 12X zoom of the camera's lens.A few reviewers have commented on the very poor quality of the manual that accompanies the S3. I must agree. It IS hard to figure out and I've got a lot of experience reading Canon manuals, figuring out Canon menus and setting camera dials. It's been my experience most folks don't read the manuals. They learn just enough to take pictures and never explore the full power of these devices. The big \"P\" on the Program dial does NOT stand for \"perfect\". So, if you don't read manuals, ignore my comments.The picture quality is very good and should not disappoint anyone - assuming of course it's properly focused. The one thing you need to know is that as good as the meter is in this camera, you will have to learn about Exposure Compensation if you expect properly exposed images. Over- and under- exposures can be avoided with compensation and using the camera's histogram features.I gave this camera a 3 star rating because it does not live up to the quality and performance I've come to expect from Canon.

Gittins", "ReviewID": "RYPL3DVU0USRT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After giving up a 30-year hobby for a while, I sold all my film stuff and got a Canon A95 to check out digital photography. When the A95 was stolen, I got an A620. This got me back into photography enough that I bought a Pentax DSLR and a bunch of lenses. As that bag started to get quite heavy and bulky, I started pooping around with the A620 again for those times I wanted to travel light or casual (such at a nephew's wedding where I was not, thankfully, \"the\" photographer.) However, the A620, nice as it was, is a bit limiting on the focal length - not particularly wide, and not really telephoto, either. So, I decided to sell the A620 and get the S3, mainly for the longer focal length for daylight people shots.I opted not to get the S5 as I would not be using an external flash, the extra megapixels are not needed, and the other minor differences did not justify the additional $200 in cost.So, am I better off than before? Maybe. I have a nice stabilized zoom,  and a better movie mode that I'm sure I will put to use on occasion. I have a faster continuous shooting mode as well. And the live histogram is a great feature, too.If that was the end of it I would give it 4 or 5 stars. However, with all the good stuff, there are a couple things that are a real problem.First is the ISO button on the back. This is very easy to push by accident (perhaps even with my nose?) and if you don't frequently check the tiny ISO setting in the viewfinder (if you are shooting that way), you run the risk of some unusable, grainy high-ISO shots :-(Second, a good/bad thing is the \"S\" button on the back. This is a \"shortcut\" button that can be set to one of a few functions, such as focus lock, white balance, movie frame rate, etc. However, it comes set to adjust the image size. So, much like the ISO button, until you switch the setting you'll risk shooting a bunch of small images before you realize the error. I have subsequently changed the button to simply turn off the display.The third issue is the poor high-ISO performance. At 80 or 100 the image is smooth and nice. At 200 there is a touch of grain but definitely acceptable. At 400 you are going to have noticeable grain, and you should only use 800 for documentation - such as showing the neighbor's car in your parking space, or similar non-artistic images (unless you are using grain as the effect).So, essentially a great camera has some serious button problems. Too bad the ISO is not just another programmable shortcut button. I'm thinking of making a little cover over it - how silly is that? (Edit - I've stuck some 1/4 inch rubber circles right next to the button. They've nearly eliminated accidental button pushes, though I still check the setting frequently.)Oh, the EVF is pretty grainy compared to an optical viewfinder. And the LCD, like most, is a pain in sunlight, even in the \"bright\" setting.If you don't need the fancy stereo-sound movies or a rotating LCD, there may be better alternatives.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love this camera.", "Author": "MDS \"Spiraleyes\"", "ReviewID": "RK1F05RFJ6WFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been my all time favorite purchase made in the last several years.

I'll just comment on a few things.The video quality is amazing.  It comes with an A/V cable to plug into the tv so you can watch video directly on the tv.  The quality on the tv was comparable to my Panasonic MiniDV camcorder.  I didn't even consider the video abilities when I bought this, but in the few weeks I've had it, I can already see that this will replace my regular video camera for most uses.  I just need to get a DVD burner on the computer.  Needed a reason to upgrade!  I never carry the real video camera when we travel, because it was such a pain to pack and carry around.  Now I've got one built in.  The sound and picture quality are amazing.  I downloaded video from the SD card onto the computer and used Microsoft's MovieMaker to edit the video, add captions, resize them for the Web and attach them to emails to the grandparents.  Fabulous.  (MovieMaker is included in XP's ServicePak 2.  I had a heck of a time finding it on my computer, though.  Found it by clicking on Start, then All Programs, then Video, then Movie Maker.  It's pretty self explanatory, except that after you open a file you have to drag the icon to the bottom of the screen to edit it.  Click on the options tab at the top and you can limit the size of your movie to optimize for email, e.g. 4 MB, etc.)  Also, you don't have to switch from still shots to video mode.  You just push the video record button at any time.  One downside, though. While recording video, it doesn't seem that you can take still shots.  If you push the shutter button it freezes a \"picture\" within the video, but it doesn't save it as a separate photo file.  Maybe the next generation will fix this, or maybe I'm not doing something right.I like the easy ability to turn off all sounds the camera makes.  We had robins nesting on our windowsill and I was able to start up the camera and take pictures silently without scaring them off.  The video taken in this mute mode still has sound in playback.  We could hear all the chirping clearly.Size -- I was torn between getting a smaller camera and getting a camera with zoom power.  My previous camera had a 3X optical zoom.  I'm so glad I went for the 12X zoom.  Already I'm taking pictures that I never would have been able to get before.  The camera is not that big, and will easily fit in a big handbag or a backpack, even in the bag I got for it.  It comes with a neck strap that attaches securely to the sides of the camera.  I bought a camera bag that opens from the top so that I can easily get the camera in and out while carrying the bag.  I have found the camera surprisingly comfortable to \"wear\" around my neck.Shot-to-shot speed is good and shutter lag isn't a problem like with my old Minolta.Canon S3 IS vs. pocket-size camera:  The Canon is small enough to carry comfortably while travelling or going to the kids' sporting events.  I wouldn't carry it around all the time, though.  My current cell phone doesn't take pictures, but I figure the next one I get will take decent enough pictures to catch that unexpected photo opportunity, and that's an item I would have with me all the time.Battery usage.  The Canon comes with 4 regular AA batteries (not rechargeable).  I ordered rechargeables at the same time, but plunked the regular AA's in when I opened the camera.  I've taken about 10 video clips of around 2-3 minutes apiece and about 50 pictures without any noticeable slowing in performance so far.  My old camera wouldn't have survived the 50 still shots!Program modes:  I never used the program modes on my old camera.  The most I ever did was turn the flash off to shoot through glass.  (I'm not a photographer!)  I have found myself actually using the program modes on the Canon, though.  They are easy and intuitive.  I especially like the fact that you don't have to remember what the little symbols stand for, because the symbol appears with the name of the program on the LCD screen.  There are the \"idiot\" programs on one side of the dial and the professional settings on the other.  I even found myself playing with the professional settings and the ISO button after reading the owner's manual.I keep forgetting turn the LCD screen back around when I turn off the camera, but I haven't had any problems with it.Do I even need to say anything about the quality of the pictures?

I purchased the Nikon D50 last December and it is an excellent camera except that it had so many more functions that I didn't need nor understood how to use.Then I found out about the Canon S3 IS. It's seems like the perfect in between camera! It has a bunch of the Canon creative modes like night shot, sports, color accent, black & white, but it also has modes where you can adjust your pictures manually, like shutter and aperture priority. The display shows all the functions you are currently using as well as a live histogram to aid you while you take pictures. It also adjusts the image on the LCD (unlike for pro-SLRs) so you know what your picture will most likely look like with your settings. The video/sound is superb. Shots take in auto look great as well.The body of the camera is ergonomically friendly. It looks and feels like a mini-SLR, it's lightweight, and the controls are extremely easy to learn and use. The LCD also flips and and turns 180 degrees for when you want to take self-portraits. It's also useful flipped out to get a better view of things higher and lower than your usual field of vision. The LCD could be bigger but it's not a big deal to me. The rockers, dials, and buttons function smoothly and the menu is very intuitive.The camera uses 4AA batteries. It comes with 4 disposibles but you have to buy your own rechargable batteries with charger. I think it's great though to have AA batteries rather than those camera-specific batteries (which my Canon SD600 and Nikon D50 both used) because you can actually just buy some AAs if your rechargables run out and you don't have the charger on hand. I read that you should buy the nimh with an mah of 2500 or greater because these supposedly last longer per charge.Overall, this camera is an excellent choice for those who want more control over their pictures than with their point-and-shoots but for whom SLRs might be too expensive or just too pro (like it was for me). You will actually use all the functions on this camera. I think it's also a great camera to use and learn to use more manual functions in case you decide to eventually move up to an SLR.Enjoy! :)", "Date": "March 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot Pro Series", "Author": "Ranney L.

This is my 5th digital camera and I did extensive research before my purchase. This is as close to an SLR as you will get without actually buying one. Technically this IS an SLR because it does \"See through the lens\". One thing I love about the EVF is what you compose/crop/see in the frame is what you get. Not an extra 5 feet to either side or whatever. The EVF is a little weird to get used to if you've used an optical viewfinder all your life.The camera does have some chromatic aberration issues but you still can't pry it out of my hands.This review is mainly in response to Ana y lat's review, that I found interesting as well as answer some not quite questions you have.The flash issue: Recycle time for a flash is, well, recycle time. We have to live with it. Some maybe faster than others. Most modern day flashes have what's called a thyristor (sp). This device, usually a little window pointing the same way as the lens, measures the light reflected off the subject. If the subject is close, a lot of light is returned to the thyristor, and the flash only discharges what it needs from the internal capacitor. You may get 2,3 or more pictures depending on how depleted the capacitor charge is. Once depleted, you have to wait for the capacitor to charge again.Your focusing issue on your baby's face: Auto focusing - Some older cameras used to use sub-sonic or ultra-sonic audio waves that get sent out of the camera and bounce back. Similar to radar/doppler effect. Much more expensive than software. Today's cameras use software to focus. But it needs something to focus on. Point your S3 to a plain wall or up to a blue sky with no clouds will do the same, and push the shutter release a little. It will not focus. When your camera will not focus on your baby's face, point the camera left or right a little on a blanket or pillow, anything with information enough for the cam to focus, but the same distance as your baby's face or your focal point. Push the shutter half way to let the cam focus. Then compose your shot and push the shutter release the rest of the way. You can use the same concept outside to over/under expose your shots, tricking the light meter instead of the focusing unit. You can also, of course, use the manual focus.Hope this helps.Keep snapping.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "The total package!", "Author": "Daniel Limbach \"Reader, writer, gadget guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3FPWRUO8R608F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are interested in taking great pictures, and sometimes you want near-DSLR capabilities, this is the camera for you.

I feel as though I need to take a class in order to figure out everything that it is capable of doing.  So, I guess in jargon speak, it is feature rich.

My DV camcorder recently died on us and now we are going to use the S3IS as our main camcorder for a few months.  The video feature is great.  It takes just enough frames per second to keep the video looking crisp and clear.  Also, the fact that you can still zoom while recording, a feature I didn't have on my last still shot camera, is amazing to me.Cons:  I have been getting frustrated taking pictures indoors because of the lag time produced by the autofocus.  In auto mode you may well miss that shot you wanted indoors because the camera was unable to set the distance properly and adjust the flash for the distance.  Operating without the flash changes the lens speed so that those pictures are frequently blurry.

The majority of the owners' reports here are testimony to that.For the rest of us the Canon S3 came tantalizingly close to being that ideal camera, but fell short for various reasons. We had hoped for more, not so much in features and options, but mainly in the quality  of what was offered. I found that it missed out in four principal areas:1. its LCD screen is small and its resolution poor. The same is true of its EVF (viewfinder.) The LCD solarizes in bright sunlight making it impossible to use and is not bright enough to use in very sunny conditions.2. it has chromatic aberration (purple/green fringing) especially at the telephoto end of the lens3. it has no RAW mode4. it's overpriced.If the LCD & EVF had had decent size and resolution I probably could have lived with the other three. Almost every review mentioned this shortcoming. I liked the articulated screen - a must for me. But so small and so lo-res just didn't cut it for me. One user told me the EVF image was so pixilated in bright conditions he couldn't really tell what he had until he saw it on the computer.I had hoped to do some semi-pro work with this camera. Doing it with this LCD would be difficult and difficult I don't like. And that missing RAW mode, lamented by many reviewers and offered by other cameras in this class, confirmed that it was -almost - a photographer's camera, as distinct from a point-&-shoot, that didn't quite make it. And that disappoints me.I saw a lot of  tele shots with purple fringing especially at the extreme end of the lens. Most of that could be eliminated with Photoshop work or by using a shorter focal length. But if you can't use the full length of your lens or you have to fix the image later, those are major shortcomings I don't want. An aprochromatic lens system, admittedly more expensive, would eliminate this problem.I think the price factor worth consideration. The current best price here on the West Coast of Canada was $C580. But you need to buy a charger and batteries $39, plus a memory card since the ludicrously small one supplied could take only four hi-res pix, another $39. And a bag, say $20. And of course sales taxes. And you've got a camera costing around $800. And if you wanted a lens hood and supplementary lenses you're getting close to $C1,000. So it's not really a $500-and-change camera: in this price range it's competing with SLRs and other high end cameras.For me, with the limitations I have described, that's just too much. For my eight or nine big ones I want top of the line quality. I hope that Canon hears the laments from many other reviewers and myself and rectifies them in the S4. They came so close this time but just missed the ring for so many serious photographers. I'm hoping the S4 will be THE one and not, like the S3,  the one that might have been.

My first reaction upon purchase was that it was so small- it fit snugly in my hand, and yet it felt rugged and strong enough for the bumps that I would undoubtedly subject it to.I wasn't keen on purchasing those 10MP cameras that have recently made their appearance- my personal experience was that more megapixels meant a larger photo size, but didn't translate well into better pictures. I wanted something solid, something built to take good photographs, one that gave me enough control over the shots I'd take.Enter the S3 IS.The 12x optical zoom is powerful enough to satisfy the macro enthusiast. The aperture and shutter priorities provide you with enough control over your photograph, but take care of enough so that the pictures you want *right now* are fantastic. Of course, if you want more control, there's the manual option too. If you're taking a quick shot of a squirrel scampering across the field, there's the sports shot, and a quick thumb movement will have you ready in no time. For those moments you just can't wait to fumble around, the S3 is the tool to have.With a flip out screen, you don't have to stand on your tiptoes next time you're at a parade, guessing at the right angle to get some shot or other. In fact, if you rotate your camera, your LCD screen content will move from landscape to portrait, automatically.I'm also a big fan of the viewfinder. The conventional viewfinders do their job perfectly, but there's nothing like seeing everything you need while also seeing the thing you're shooting. And there's no need to have your face 5 inches from the screen just to be able to make sense of the LCD, no need to flip out the screen every time - the viewfinder has everything you see on the LCD.Controlling the flash is also really easy- if the flash is down, it's off. No need to press buttons or go through menus or disable the autoflash. The lenscap, I've heard, is a bit of a disappointment for some. For a person such as myself who is inclined to activate the lens before removing the lenscap, it does its job splendidly.In short, the S3 is the perfect upgrade from the standard in-my-pocket point and shoot that provides satisfactory pictures you just might print someday. The S3 furnishes pictures you're going to want to print and share- it's fast when you need it, but with the options you want to compose a beautiful shot.

It will do that with great results but you can get a good point and click camera for a much cheaper price.  This camera is for people who want results comparable to a digital SLR but aren't willing to pay the price, or want it in a smaller package.I compared the specs on this camera to an expensive Canon digital SLR camera a friend of mine has and the only meaningful difference is in pixal count.  The amount of control over the picture, functions, and the quality and specs of the imaging components are virtually the same; in fact the S3 was superior in some areas.Now of course the digital SLR has interchangeable lenses and in the long run one can be more creative and versitile with one. But with this camera you get 90% of the functionality without having to carry around a large camera body and a bag of lenses.  You can also do it at 25% of the cost or less when you consider the price of the lenses.  The 12X zoom alone is comparable to having to buy a 400mm lense.The only problem I have with this camera is that with the amount of control and functions available I spend a lot of time in the book figuring out what I can do and how to do it.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "S3 is great", "Author": "Bradley Cross", "ReviewID": "R2DNOBS5T44OQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews of many cameras here and elsewhere, I decided on the S3.

I did not buy my Canon S3 from Amazon.  However, I have purchased several cameras from Amazon, with absolutely no complaints.  That being said, the S3 has proven to be a phenomenal little powerhouse!  With the ability to insert abundant memory, its uses are almost limitless.  Since six megapixels is at or above 35mm picture quality,there is no need to get hung up on the whole megapixel scam.  In some instances, a higher megapixel camera can actually do more harm to your photos than good.  I also own a Canon rebel XTi with an assortment of lenses, but find myself falling back on this Canon S3 time and time again.  I will resist the temptation to delve into heavy technical details, and simply state, there is more \"bang for the buck\" in this little camera than you can possibly imagine.  A nice finishing touch, would have been remote access, and the ability to use a shutter release cable.  I would recommend the Lens Mate adapter, as they are of superior quality and allow you to use filters.  The adapters sold by Canon at equal or even a higher price are nowhere near the quality of the Lens Mate.  I have used their adapters on all of my Canon cameras with excellent results.  You simply will not disappointed with this precision instrument and its plethora of capabilities.  Of course, you can always set it to auto and shoot your hearts content.  Canon's auto feature is insanely accurate and has produced some very high quality pictures for me.  I tend to use the S3 as a backup for the XTi, simply setting the S3 on auto as to not miss a shot.  When I purchased my S3 it was $500.  I believe at this point, they are hovering somewhere around $300?  At $500, plus adapter and filters.  I thought I got a great deal, at $300 ... it would be a phenomenal deal.  This is also a great introductory camera to practice with, prior to buying into the DSLR systems.  Although, like me, you might step up to the DSLR, but find the S3 in your hand more often than not.

As weird as this sounds, I was looking for a new camera because our old sony digital camera had ergonomic issues - my wife could not press it's shutter button due to her long fingernails.  We also wanted to take just 1 camera, not 2 ( a still and video camera )to our daughters' cheerleading competitions.This is what is great about this camera (for us):1) The shutter button is easy to press, even with long fingernails.2) It's \"sport\" mode is easy to access via the mode wheel on top of the camera - much quicker and easier than trying to access it via a menu list.3) It takes amazing video WITH STEREO SOUND.  You can zoom in and out while recording video, which you cannot do with many other \" still \" cameras.  You can record around 37 minutes of video on a 4gb SD card at the highest quality recording setting.  Owing to it's great 12X optical zoom, and image stabilization, this camera shoots better video than my dedicated JVC digital video camera.  It is also far easier during editing to work with video clips from a flash memory card than from a digital video tape.4) It has a \"rotating\" lcd display - this means that you can flip the lcd display around to protect the screen if you have the camera hanging around your neck but not in the case.5) It accepts 4gb SD cards, even cheap no-name brands.6) It takes great pictures.This it what is not so great:1) You can only record a little over 9 minutes of high quality video at a time before the camera shuts off recording (but you can immediately start recording again, assuming you have the memory space). This is really not such a negative for us, as for recording \"family\" events rarely involves a video clip of more then 5 minutes.2) The camera will not output pictures in RAW format.  As we don't do a lot of serious photo editing, this was not a big issue for us.So that's it.  As there is not another super-zoom point and shoot camera with stereo video recording and a rotating lcd screen out there, we purchased this one, and are quite happy with it.", "Date": "December 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, worth the money", "Author": "D.

Yes, there are some noise issues from 200 ISO on up but with IS I don't usually use 400 or 800. The bracketing feature is AWESOME. I also find that the IS is more effective on the 2nd & 3rd shots, due to the fact that you don't have to press the shutter for those last 2.The ISO button being right there is great too, and the function button is a great shortcut to exposure & flash adjustments, white balance, color options, and the bracketing choices. I also like that it saves whatever setting you were on last, although sometimes I forget and wind up using tungsten WB in daylight, but I find the Auto WB works great so I usually use that.The noise issue doesn't bother me for what I expected, and I plan to use noise reduction software anyway. I don't expect Pro SLR results out of what is essentially a feature loaded point and shoot.It's also very quiet and I haven't had issues with the lens cap coming off - unless you're careless with it and you shouldn't be anyway.Love the rotating screen and am not bothered by the size. I suppose if you have bad vision or like to show instant results to others a lot a bigger screen is nice, but I'm fine.I also ADORE the included software although the red eye function is a little finicky sometimes.I also use it to preview what to expect when shooting 35mm film, until I can afford the Canon EOS 5D.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Great go-between for those who aren't ready for the expense of a D-SLR", "Author": "K.

Before, when I wanted good quality photos, I would resort to using my old Canon A1 SLR film camera, which I have been using since the mid eighties.I was very pleased to see this camera not only took excellent pictures, but also included most of the features of my old SLR, such as the ability to set the apertures and shutter speeds manually.  Also with a lens adopter(I prefer the aluminum ones made by Lensmate over Canon's plastic ones) and stepping ring (both purchased separately) I could also use my collection of lens filters from my old SLR.This camera works much like an SLR, only it uses a digital viewfinder instead of an optical one.  This is one of the reasons I like this camera, as I like to shoot pictures of wildlife and the ability to turn off the shutter sound is a real boon.  With an optical viewfinder on a SLR there is a little mirror inside the camera to reflect the view into the viewfinder, the mirror must be raised to take a picture, causing an unavoidable `thunk' sound which can make wildlife photography very difficult.Though the automatic modes make this camera accessible to anyone, it might not be the best camera for those looking for a simple point and shoot camera.  The ones who will benefit most from this camera are serious amatures and professionals looking for an alternative to a DSLR.  Also worth mentioning, there are 1st and 3rd party lenses and accessories available for this camera.Summing this up, I must say I am very pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a serious high quality digital camera.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera for an improving amateur", "Author": "C.

When my Nikon point-and-shoot (Coolpix L4) died, it was the perfect excuse to upgrade to a nicer camera. I don't have the money for an outright DSLR, but I wanted something more substantial than another \"credit-card\" camera. I also wanted to be able to switch things up with lenses and accessories, allowing me to be more creative and have more options when shooting.Enter the Canon S3 IS. More substantial than the traditional point-and-shoot, less expensive than normal DSLRs, compatible with lenses and various creative accessories. (Plus it looks darn cool.)How are the pictures? They are wonderful. The Canon gives me rich, beautiful colors, has little trouble with camera shake, and subjects generally show up appropriately sharp and clear. The zoom is really amazing, being quick, smooth, and capturing clear images. I think there is a definite learning curve to understanding how to adjust various settings. If one is motivated, this learning curve is surmountable.In terms of features: I can adjust settings to be more creative than I could with most point-and-shoot digital cameras. ISO, exposure, aperture, shutter speed, focus, white balance, flash, metering, and other settings can be manually changed. While the highest ISO setting is 800, I don't really care, since I rarely raise ISO anyway.The grip is wonderful and I feel comfortable handling it. Having a viewfinder makes a world of difference in stabilizing shots and taking shots in bright light. I am not a fan of the plastic mounting threads on the bottom. My old Nikon camera's plastic threads were ripped up pretty good after about a year! Let's hope it's not going to happen with the Canon.This camera would be very appropriate for people who have discovered a love for digital photography, who are upgrading from a $100-$200 digital camera, but who are not ready to plunk down $1000+ for a digital SLR.

The only thing that the S3 IS lacks as far as a replacement is the Bulb function. That was a key thing i was looking for, because photos taken at shutter speeds of over 30 seconds get interesting results.I've taken this camera out on a few road trips now, and i can honestly say that it suits my needs perfectly. The wide screen mode is very handy for making desktop backgrounds (i have a widescreen monitor) and overall, as long as you know what you're doing, the pictures come out crystal clear and don't have any grain.The grain factor in this camera comes in ISO speeds of over 200. So using the  \"dummie mode\" in anything besides daylght would probably result in a grainy picture.As far as the custom mode goes, i haven't figured out how to save it, but the program mode does just fine for what i need now. Obviously i haven't played with all the bells and whistles on this thing yet, but i really do like everything about it. The auto mode sucks though.Video capture on it is pretty nice as well. I've never had sterio video on a digital camera. The microphone even captures slight echoes from voices at a lake.The 12x zoom is very cool. The camera that this is replacing is an SLR and  its big lense on that one just barely keeps up with this one.The S3 IS is also a big step up from what i used to have for a digital camera; a Fujii Finepix A345. I could take some amazing pictures with the Fujii, and at first with the S3 IS i was disappointed because of the auto mode's grainy high ISOs. Getting around that was easy enough though.Very good flash recycle time (i'm not a big flash user, but i thought it was a good note to add). Good continuous shots. The swivvle screen comes in handy.

The video option lets you record in stereo, and you can even interrupt that mode to shoot still photos; the sound will continue unbroken while there will be just a short blip in the video.  This feature is ideal if, for example, you want to record a portion of a child's concert or recital.  One caution in that regard: get yourself a 2-gig flashcard (maybe two of them) so you won't run out of space while recording videos.

It also has settings specific to different situations - night scenery, day scenery, sports, people, and so on.The zoom on this camera is above average. 12X is amazing, and the quality of the photos at full zoom are surprisingly clear. Movies are high quality and can be taken at any time (for example, with the camera set on \"night scenery\" or \"sports\" or anything else). Still photos can be taken while shooting a \"movie\", too. I recommend getting a high speed memory card in order to ensure smooth video footage.The camera fits well into my hands, which gives me more stability when I am taking pictures. The camera does have a \"stabilizer\" feature, but I haven't really had the need for it yet.No complaints thusfar with this camera.

This is an upgrade from my Nikon 4MP camera.I've had the Canon S3 a couple weeks now and I purchased the Canon Lens Adapter and Hood Set but I picked the FREE SUPER SAVING SHIPPING aka Super slow shipping. The camera and charger/Battery (LaCrosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger, NICE) combo arrived Saturday before the SD memory card and Lens Adapter that arrived in a second shipment the following Monday. I don't understand why two separate shipments as everything was in stock.Since I had the camera for two days before the Lens Adapter came I'll have to say that the adapter is worth having if just to give me more to hold. The first couple of days I found it difficult to grab the camera without pressing a button (not a problem if the camera wasn't left turned on), I assume because my Nikon had a different feel. I was impressed with the Image Stabilization and zoom right off. After getting the Lens Adapter and getting a few days use. All seems natural. The menu is logical and easy to navigate. The only thing I miss from my Nikon was that I could goto thumbnail mode and tag several photo's to delete if I wanted quickly. I saw a post someplace (could have been here) about it's bad that the S3 doesn't have a battery meter. That is true but it has a battery indicator that flashes when the batteries get low. I shot several outside photos after it started flashing and the camera never cut itself off so I don't know if it will auto-cutoff or what the battery level is at that point. I do know that the Canon S3 IS is very easy on batteries. Quick less than 2 second power up, Focus is quick and shutter almost no shutter lag makes a nice camera, and to add all the other features the S3 has.

The shutter response is reasonable, the LCD screen is a good size and quickly/easily switches to viewfinder. The dial on top to change functions is user friendly and logical. We especially like that we can zoom/unzoom and take pictures with one hand due to the location of the buttons. We are also very pleased with the adjustability of the LCD screen that has allowed us to sneak around corners to catch grandma's and aunties changing the new babies diaper or to shoot over a crowd at a wedding reception!Only a few (slight) disappointments: the sensitivity of needing flash when using \"auto\" mode- there have been numerous cute baby pictures in low light that either have been missed because there wasn't time to flip flash (or change to low light) or the shot ends up overbright when the flash is used.... the quick usage of batteries which is why we are researching and planning to convert to rechargeables.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Can't go wrong with Canon.", "Author": "David A.

This is my first digital camera however I have been a photography aficionado. I am trying to learn the tricks of the trade. Coming back to the point - the camera has truly brilliant colors, the 12X optical zoom is very powerful (look at some of the images I have posted).It can be a point-n-shoot for one who does not want to play with a bunch of settings, yet has enough challenge for the person who wants to learn more about it. However if you are looking for an ultracompact point n'shoot this is not for you.I have not shot any movies with it yet, so would not review movie mode yet. The specs. though say that the maximum size of a movie is limited to 1GB (even if you have a 2GB or 4GB memory card). If you want movies to be bigger than 1GB (15-20 mins. best quality video can fill-up 1 GB) - you will have to break your movies into multiples of 1 GB.Pros: Brilliant colors, feature rich (stitch mode - used to stitch several photos together like a panoramic landscape, color-swap), powerful 12X optical zoom, solidly built, pro-look, zoom browsing s/w is simple, powerful yet easy to use, eletronic view-finder is a good alternative some times, Made in Japan, Image Stabilizer really works !Cons: Battery compartment - a little clumsy to close the battery compartment after loading it,  fear I could break it. I think there is a trick to it that I have not picked up yet. The only other thing I can think of is - no display for remaining battery life, it will give you a warning that you are on low battery, and a final warning before dying on you, in other words there is no progressive display for battery life.  The 4 AA's that come with the camera only last a couple of days - 50 pictures, aprox.

VANDALEN", "ReviewID": "RHUE46QDGF6RL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Canon G2 (very slow but destined to become a classic).  My second camera was a Sony H1.  What I soon missed with the Sony was the swivel screen of the G2, and I didn't care for the ergonomics of the H1, the autofocus/manual focus performance and the 12 seconds between flash shots either.  I recently bought the S3 because I really liked the overall look and feel: it felt like a combination of the G2 and a digital SLR in a small package.  The video performance is impressive as is the image stabilization (which was not as good with the H1).  Overall, picture taking performance in various modes is quite good and preferred over the H1, although both the H1 and S3 suffer from poor high ISO/low light performance.  There remains, however, one serious S3 image problem: purple fringing. Outdoor high zoom pictures where there is strong contrast between light and dark objects (skin in direct sunlight with strong shadow for instance) results in a thick violet outline or \"radioactive glow\" where light and dark meet.  Canon touts its lens technology of the S3 and states \"...ultra low dispersion lens significantly reduces chromatic aberation in telephoto shots.\"  Even with this \"technology\" the S3 has almost twice the degree of chromatic aberation \"purple fringing\" as the Sony H1 (the G2 had some fringing but it was blue and less obvious - but only 3x telephoto).  I've done exhaustive comparisons between the two cameras to reach this conclusion.  Strangly, an old abused store demo S3 had less fringing than the new cameras - I returned two S3s because of this issue. Perhaps the quality of lens manufacture declined with the newer units.  The only partial remedy I found to this problem is to shoot all outdoor shots at f8 and do not exceed about 6x-8x instead of the max optical 12x telephoto. This will substantially reduce fringing in the center of photos, but not in the outer areas. Also, UV or polarizing filters do not help.  Because I actually still like this camera so much, I've decided to put up with the fringing handicap - until I finally give in to the expense and extreme bulk of a decent digital SLR and quality telephoto lens.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "David S.

I was prepared to make some sacrifices compared to an SLR, but even so this camera didn't quite make the cut and I returned it. Here's why.PROS: It's small and light (compared to an SLR). The EVF is very usable. The ability to swivel the display is great, especially for macro shooting. Super macro mode gets you very close. The long zoom is fun, and the image stabilization makes it usable. For this type of camera, noise is well controlled at ISO 100 and 200, and the noise reduction is light (no smearing). Live histogram and gridlines are both available. Focusing speed, shutter lag, and save times are all pretty good. The lens is quite fast considering its focal range; it's easy to create background blur at most focal lengths. Good hand grip. Overall, a great feature set in very flexible and usable design.CONS: As with all compact cameras, dynamic range is limited, highlights often get clipped, and anything over ISO 400 is basically worthless. I was prepared to put up with that. But what immediately bothered me was the amount of chromatic aberration (both purple and red fringing, especially next to black areas) and corner softness, plus mild vignetting.

Instead, just use the savings to complete your kit...RK - SE MISystem: S3; Lensmate adaptor (52mm); UltraPod II; Tamrac 5510 bag; \"folding\" lens hood; Hoya HMC Multi-coated UV filter (52mm); Eneloop & Panasonic Ni-Mh AAs; SanDisk 2GB SD cards (1 Std; 3 Ultra II - either version seems to work fine).Personal Comparisons: Canon A70 (3mp / 3x optical); Kodak \"advanced digital\" (4mp / 4x optical); Pentax K10D w/ 2 lens kit + several OLD \"film\" lenses. (A GREAT camera - wonderful images if you want to WORK with them - but for unedited 5 x 7 prints? For Viewing on Monitor / TV? No one will know which image came from which camera.... Sure: Crop, Enlarge, work with Difficult Subject Matter and the more advanced camerashave an advantage. If you REALLY want to shoot \"ART\" settle for nothing LESS than an SLR - but for day-to-day use?

Aside from the newer sensor, the welcome addition of a direct ISO button, sports mode and marginally bigger screen, the biggest change is the paint job, which has produced a camera that looks a lot less toy-like than the S2 IS.There is a slight improvement in image quality; a bit more resolution and much nicer looking ISO 400 output (though as noted in the review, ISO 400 on the S3 is nowhere near as sensitive as ISO 400 on the S2), but to be honest I think you'd struggle to see any real difference in a normal sized print.Comparisons with it predecessor aside, the S3 IS Image quality is very good - certainly on a par with most of its competitors - though the results are still a bit on the soft side, something the fairly high default sharpening doesn't really help. Again, experimenting with the in-camera parameters and a little sympathetic post-processing means that in the right hands it can produce images every bit as good as anything else in its class. The ISO 800 mode is probably too noisy for anything but 'emergency' use, and there are occasional exposure problems, but generally speaking the output is pleasing enough to satisfy the majority of the intended market.But ultimately, like the models that came before it, the appeal of the S3 IS goes beyond simple pixel-peeping; it has a class-leading feature set, a very reliable image stabilization system (the benefits of which cannot be overstated) and superb handling. It's well-priced, incredibly versatile and - above all - highly enjoyable to use. Despite the long lens and speedy operation it's not the ideal 'sports' camera (the focus at the long end of the zoom isn't fast enough and does hunt a little), but for sheer shooting pleasure and versatility the PowerShot S3 IS still takes some beating.\"The above is the original review which made me go for this camera, and after buying it, I have realised how true the review was.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon S3 IS", "Author": "Krazy Kid", "ReviewID": "R1YSWKL1IE7JP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one.

He looked at me blankly, blinked, then responded, \"The shape of the headlights.\" Well, Canon changed a bit more than the shape of the headlights between the PowerShot S2 IS and the S3 IS, but not much. The newer model integrates a 6-megapixel CCD instead of 5 megapixels, and Canon tosses in a few new features, but ultimately, it's the same camera. That's not necessarily a bad thing--the S2 remains a great camera, and the S3 carries on the tradition.The Canon PowerShot S3 IS's aesthetic seems to be a cross between those of a classic Volkswagen Beetle and a Busy Box. Granted, it's the same body as its predecessor's, but the silver bits stand out more against the current version's iridescent, dark gray plastic than they did against the previous model's silver coloring. As with the S2, there's certainly enough here to keep you busy for a long time, though, and loving every minute of it. (For more details about the S2/S3's basic design and features, read the PowerShot S2 IS review.)For the S3, Canon upped the size of the flip-and-twist LCD to 2 inches from 1.8, which is still disappointingly small. The company also added a ludicrous 16:9 aspect mode: not only does it simply crop and letterbox the standard 4:3 image, but the LCD is too small for a functional letterbox display. More useful is the new 320x240 60fps movie-capture mode, which produces slick little movies, as does the VGA, 30fps mode. Unfortunately, the camera still lacks raw format support.Oddly, despite the different sensors--or perhaps because they use the same f/2.7-to-f/3.5, 36mm-to-432mm lens and Digic II imaging processor--the S3's photos look almost identical to the S2's. They display a broad tonal range, albeit with some clipping in the highlights and shadows, very good color accuracy and saturation, and acceptable edge-to-edge sharpness. Its noise profile follows suit as well: low until about ISO 200, then increasingly bad. Though the camera can now boost ISO sensitivity to as high as ISO 800, either manually or by enabling ISO Boost in a programmed-exposure mode, the noise at that setting is quite obtrusive. In general, the S3's photos look good but can't really shake the digital look, either onscreen or in print.The haloing around the hands, the smearing in the corduroy, and the general lack of detail in the bricks make this photo look obviously digital. Keep in mind that this was shot at maximum telephoto, however.Performance, while not identical to the S2's, is either the equivalent or better. Start-up to first shot takes only 1.5 seconds, which is quite zippy overall, and extremely good for a camera that has a long lens to extend. Shutter lag in bright light runs about 0.4 second and doubles to 0.8 second when the lights get low. The S3 is also relatively responsive: 1.1 seconds typically from shot to shot, plus another second if the flash needs to recycle. Though it maxes out at 1.5fps in continuous-shooting mode, there's no buffer-constraint on the number of sequential shots at maximum resolution; I find that much more useful than a fast but limited burst mode. It was certainly sufficient to capture active dogs and children playing in the park, including kids spinning in a tire swing.Autofocus occurs quickly for the most part, although a few of my shots looked as if the focus hadn't locked before capture. I didn't experience any of the problems that the S2's reviewer did with SuperMacro mode; it worked fine for me, even with the lens almost pressed against the subject. The image stabilization bought me about two stops of shutter latitude, but my hands shake like an octogenarian's--a coffee-drinking octogenarian.I'm not a big fan of electronic viewfinders (EVFs), and the S3's didn't convince me otherwise; though it's fine for framing, I hate that it freezes when the shutter is pressed. The LCD is certainly viewable in most light, but I prefer an eye-level viewfinder to the unsteady arm's-length approach.True, a cheap dSLR will provide better performance, and a moderately priced one will deliver better photo quality. But the Canon PowerShot S3 IS's combination of features, performance, and relatively compact design certainly gives megazoomers a compelling alternative.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it with a stick...", "Author": "Big-Foot \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "R2P9XPP0FW86YI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My only complaint is that it only comes with a 16MB Memory stick...Nah - Are you kiddin' me??

When this camera is operational, it allows you to take some great photos.  The problem is that after a month or so of having the camera, memory card errors would occur making the camera useless until another card was put in (or the current card reformatted in the camera). This has caused a number of priceless shots to be lost.  There is a way to recover most of the images, if you have a computer, a SD card reader and the correct software, but that doesn't do much good if you are away from home.  I have tried several cards of varying capacities, speeds and manufacturers (including ones from canon) and the errors still occur.  The errors appear random. We have sent the camera in to canon 2 times for repair, we format the cards before we use them each time and the camera still is giving the errors. At this point canon is saying that it is not an issue with the camera but with the memory cards...all of them.  This is a shame because I have thrown a bit of business in Canon's direction and think that they have some of the best camera designs.While I will likely never buy another Canon again, and I can not recommend this camera to others, I know people who have had no problems with their cameras. This problem may be caused  by a defect in a certain batch of cameras, or in certain models. I suggest that before purchasing the you search specifically for errors that occur with the camera you are thinking of purchasing. I have discovered that there are several canon cameras that have had similar issues and that there are a few class action law suites against Canon for failure to address camera problems.The bottom line is that when the camera works, it works well, but when it doesn't work Canon isn't very helpful in resolving the problem.  The customer pays the shipping costs to the canon repair facility, which gets expensive fast. The people at Canon are currently not taking responsibility for the problem. So if your camera fails get ready to fight it out with Canon.  If your camera doesn't fail, you'll enjoy the photos the camera produces.UPADATEI have discovered that my camera only seems to operate with select cards.

You still have to be very careful with the camera.Another thing that it is very bulky. It wont fit in a purse/bag you would normally carry so I always end up carrying it separately.But in spite of this, I love my camera.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Kay", "ReviewID": "R3FYDBFYZH1TED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love this camera.

But with the IS, most of my pictures are very clear even at 12x zoom. The three things that I think were better on my previous camera (a Fujifilm S7000) were (1) the colors and contrast of the photos were slightly (and only slightly) better on the Fujifilm, (2) the autofocus seemed to select the area of interest better and (3) the optical viewfinder had a higher resolution. I've had some images of flowers and the like that I've tried taking close-ups of that have ended up being focused on the wrong item, partly because the viewfinder has such low resolution that I can't tell whether the flower is in focus and partly because it appears that the autofocus isn't picking out the image in the very center of the frame.

They served the purpose but that's all that I could say about them.I wanted to replace a dead p&s; model and decided to try something a little more advanced. My needs didn't require a DSLR so I stared to research other options.My first requirement was that the camera have a way other than the LCD on which to compose. This eliminated a lot of cameras from consideration. There are a few with optical viewfinders but very few were more than higher-end p&s; models.That's when I started to look into models with EVFs. This narrowed the field down considerably. Every brand and model is a compromise of some sort and it came down to finding the ones with the fewest compromises.The Canon S3IS turned out to be the camera. I bought it here on Amazon for about $20 more than it's selling for today. The price of this camera seems to be dropping almost daily. Possibly there's a replacement model coming soon.I've only had the camera for a few weeks and haven't given it a full workout yet. Preliminary results show it to be a fine piece of equipment with more features than I'll ever use. I especially like the fact that it uses AA batteries. Rechargeable NIMH batteries are inexpensive and regular alkalines are available in an emergency.Other than for 1 shortcoming, I would have given the S3IS 5 stars. The lens is quite prone to red fringing in the highlight areas at the longer end of it's focal length. I find this very disappointing coming from a company like Canon.Perhaps I'm being too fussy about this, but I've used some fine lenses over the years and am very demanding of lens performance.

This happens even though the principle subject was dead-center in the rectangular area where the camera is SUPPOSED to be autofocusing.The zoom function apparently isn't calibrated to the auto-focus function;  as you increase the zoom, what the camera actually autofocuses on moves further and further away from the rectangular area in the viewfinder that marks where it SHOULD be autofocusing.It's all too easy to 'overzoom' beyond what the camera's autofocus can handle, but there's no way to know when that has happened.  You can see the most extreme examples in the viewfinder, but there's no way to tell when you've zoomed just a little too much - you have to find out the hard way.I've learned the hard way that I need to take several pictures at various zoom levels and to NEVER try completely filling the frame using the zoom - no matter how great the temptation.

I put my Canon in sports mode and no flash and let it adjust the aperture. The picture came out a little grainy (to be expected), but otherwise was fine. That's pretty good - my friend's camera had no chance at getting that shot.- Has a good digital interface, with the one little caveat below.- It's not tiny, but it's small enough I could buy one of those little leather point-and-shoot cases and it slides in.- I have heard negatives from others about the on/off switch, but I find it works really well. It doesn't go on by itself, but if you press and turn it works fine - I can even do it all with one finger.- The video capture is very good, recording in stereo. You can even take stills at the same time (since it uses a very intuitive red \"record\" button for the video, just like a camcorder), although taking a still photo stops the video recording for the time it takes to take the still. In fact, I'd have to say that the combination of video/audio is one of the best things about this camera. For most of us, there's no longer a need to lug both a camcorder and still camera to all our kids' events - the Canon does both very well.- The display screen, though a bit on the small side, works just like a camcorder - you can flip it out and rotate it 180 degrees.- The supermacro mode is simply amazing. I have taken pictures of objects right up next to the lens, and the amount of detail you can get is no less than astounding.It has a few negatives also:- The lens cap falls off because it was designed to stay on with friction. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Make sure you bring lens cleaning papers and solution, because you'll be touching the lens alot. There's no way to attach an ultraviolet filter to the lens, either (common with point and shoots).- The camera acts as a USB disk drive to let you copy pictures OFF the camera, but to copy them back on you have to use the supplied software. The major problem with this is that you effectively can't put edited pictures back on the camera, because they don't match the exact format expected by the supplied software. Go buy a little adapter to attach the SD memory card to your USB.- The bayonette mount is plastic, as noted by others. I haven't really had to use this, but it seems like they should have made it of metal since that's a pressure point.- There's no remote control, which would be really nice when using the camera as a camcorder and taking a video of yourself.In summary, I definitely recommend this camera for the parent who wants to get good quality (but not necessarily professional) pictures.

While this camera is not as large as an SLR camera is it much larger than a pocket camera and relatively heavy. It is hard to hold onto without touching one of the buttons. There is a finger grip on the front and a pad for your thumb on the back but it is too small.

Now you know you cant have the good without the bad.Even though I said the autofocus was good it wasnt great.There were times where I went to focus in on something and despite plenty of light,the object I was aiming at was still,it would tend to lose focus.It was beyond me why this was.The ISO speeds provided some noise,especially the higher the speed.This camera is very SLR-like.You do have the option of adjusting settings and whatnot but I found out about a month into having the camera that I had maxed out these options.They can only go so far.And since they could only go so far I did sell it and get a 350D(XT).But that is only because I want to learn more about the technical side of photography,so again dont let that turn you away from this camera.And then there are the little details.Like that the camera mount was made out of plastic.Meaning if it were screwed too tightly on a tripod there is the possibility it could crack.Whenever the mermory card door was open it would turn off the camera,causing you to lose any buffed images.Even though in my mind these \"complaints\" or \"imperfections\" are extremely petty and shouldnt really deture you from buying this camera.I feel that they were things that would keep this camera from being perfect,and thus I had to mention them.  Conlusion:Get this camera.You wont be sorry.Fantastic features,a step above what Ive seen in other cameras.The rotating screen is very very handy in certain situations.Good feel in the hand.It even has some attachments that you can buy to enhance you photos.Which means you can add filters,even though the vivid colors feature recreates that.Brilliant point and shoot camera that gives SOME feel as if it were a DSLR.Again,Canon has put out a very worthy camera.And for the price you really cant go wrong.", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very happy with camera", "Author": "J.K.", "ReviewID": "REUZU2ZID62E0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great as point-and-shoot in auto mode.

It's a bit weak in indoor shooting, the flash often washes out subjects but it's quite decent outside or with natural lighting.In its age the auto focus has slowed down, but I've dropped it from the back of a horse, got it wet in snow and rain, dropped it into a rocky mess and bashed/banged it into every object near by.  It's still running fine, I've barely scratched it anywhere and the swivel screen still displays.  No HD video but I'm not shooting HD with this little guy, just fun little videos here and there.  It reads SDHC cards which is quite useful, I dislike seeing those old cameras that can't.The zoom isn't quite as nice as some newer cameras, but for its age it's decent.  I still use it as my primary point and shoot, and it has been durable for me for years now and I'll continue to abuse it.

I think I paid about $550 +/- for it. It's capable of 48x digital zoom but I never use digital zoom on any camera because the pics are terrible. This camera has a 12x optical zoom and with the 1.5x optional converter ($125), I have a 18x quality zoom. It uses 4 \"AA\" batteries that last for a long time, so you don't have to worry about recharging and replacing expensive rechargeable batteries and chargers that eventually quit working. It's a little more complicated than a point and shoot but not nearly as complicated as a DSLR. For a 6.0 mega pixel camera, it takes great pictures. I later purchased a $850 DSLR camera with 3.5-5.6/18-70 lens, an additional $550 3.5-6.3/18-250 lens and a $250 external flash and accessories totaling over $1700. This is a 14.1 mega pixel camera and it does take good pictures if you have everything set properly but I still use my Cannon Powershot S3 IS camera when I need to take a few quick shots and always have it as a back up. To the average eye, there is not a very noticeable difference in the picture quality. I love the 18x optical zoom with converter, since I have not been able to find more than 13.89x zoom for my DSLR at a cost of $550. I don't think Canon offers this camera anymore but I think they should. When you have a good product, why discontinue it? The only change I would make to it would be to have the ability to mount an external flash for those long shots. I thought about selling it a while back and I am glad I didn't.

I would highly recommend it. Not as pricey as the SLRs, but has a lot of professional features. The zoom is great. I have taken photos from great distances and gotten good results.

I am amazed at all of the modes and adjustments that can be made using the Canon system. The kinds of things that used to be on $1,000 cameras.  My biggest advise: Take the time to read your manual! There is a lot of information there that will improve your picture taking. Try learning one feature at a time if you get overwhelmed by the size of the manual. Rome wasn't built in a day. You can always erase what doesn't work. I also like that I can add additional lenses to increase my options. Most \"point and shoot\" cameras don't offer that. The built-in macro on the S3 IS is really sharp. Check out my bee on flower pic in the gallery. I accidently bumped the bee on the lens a couple of times. That is how close I was to the subject! Try out the fireworks and night settings, too. I have gotten nice pictures of lit fountains and fireworks at night with those. Another thing I was impressed by is how long the batteries last. I got Sony rechargables and they can last up to a month or more depending on use. The Canon doesn't \"eat\" standard batteries either. My Kodak was a battery hog.

It did a great job. I'm coming from a point-and-shoot with no optical zoom, so obviously I had some pretty under-whelming experiences before, but I've used the Rebel series before, and while this certainly isn't a d-SLR, it really does a fantastic job. It is pretty much the perfect balance between a d-SLR and a point-and-shoot.The image quality this puts out is really nice. Low-light shots don't give it much trouble, and coupled with the high-power flash, this was generally not an issue at all. The optical zoom does a fantastic job (I noticed some slight artifacting when zoomed at 12x in low-light, but other than that, no problems).Surprisingly, the video recording capabilities of this camera are startling. I do video production for a living, and work with an HDV camera most of the time, but use normal DV cameras as well. The quality of the video the Canon S3 can put out is at least equivalent to a decent DV-cam. Taking into account the low cost of SD flash memory nowadays (I acquired a 2GB card for $35 from a retail store), you can easily use the camera to store 20-30 minutes of video. Once 4-8GB cards become economical, I would certainly consider recommending others to look at this camera if they have neither a camera or a camcorder. The quality of the still shots you will get on this will be much higher than the stills you can get on most camcorders, and the video you get on the S3 is pretty close to what you would see on most consumer-level DV-camcorders.In summary, this is a great camera, at a very reasonable price.

The flash is very bright. The zoom is great. You can zoom in on animals, getting a very clear shot of them without them even knowing you are there. I am over all very happy with this camera. If you are buying a camera for the close up macro mode however, you might want to go with the Canon Power Shot SD 450. While the zoom is excellent with the Canon Power Shot S3 IS, the lense gets in the way of the flash when trying to take close ups, creating a shadow over the item you are taking the picture of. It has a hard time focusing super close up in the macro mode. If you are looking more for a great zoom, this is the camera for you. I own both the Canon Power Shot SD 450 and the Canon Power Shot S3 IS. The S3 IS is excellent with zooming in on far away subjects, not so great with macro. The Canon Power Shot SD 450 is great with macro close ups, really great, I've tested a lot of cameras and this was the best, but it's not so great with zooming in on far way objects and getting a clear picture.

Image Stabilization works like magic (I can hand-hold 400mm shots even on overcast days). The folding LCD is more useful than I thought (great for low macro shots). Love the size (feels like a real camera, not a disposable). Shutter lag & focus speed are very good. TV quality videos with dedicated button. SD card (best format). Common AA batteries (but get NiMH rechargeable).CONS: More purple fringing (in high contrast areas) than I expected - not as good as my Nikon CoolPix 7600. This is not a problem for 4x6 prints and TV/DVD slideshows, but I think it will start being noticeable in prints larger than 8x10. High pitched whine in video, but it improves if you lower the sampling rate (plus I was able to filter it out with a Low Pass filter in Premiere Elements). Zooms a little too fast for my taste. Wish I could attach filters without an adapter.OPINION: Electronic View Finders are better than SLRs because SLRs don't take movies, which really add pizzazz to a slideshow (now on DVD, or search for \"worldjim\" on YouTube). The clunky mirror mechanism was needed in a film world, but not in digital; LCDs (even on the cheapest cameras) do exactly what SLRs do - view through the recording lens. However, EVFs are still geared for the less serious photographer. EVF LCDs and CCDs still need improvement, but that will come in time. Plus interchangeable lenses would be nice.ACCESSORIES: I got an adapter (on eBay) so I could use a polarizer - a must for serious photographers. It works, but it's a little tricky to use with the EVF or LCD.OVERALL: Not perfect, but no digital camera is. Even though it needs some improvement, I still think it's the best compromise on the market today (for what I want to do). I consider this my first serious digital camera, and I'd buy it again.UPDATE (4/19/07): I hope I didn't sound too negative. On the contrary, I love this camera. It's just that I'm picky when it comes to cameras (I'm a Nikon FM2 guy at heart). And like I said, I didn't like anything until now.

There are buttons everywhere that you would naturally put your hand to hold a camera if you are even a slightly experienced photographer.  I kept resetting features everytime I picked up the camera, and ended up finally handling it like a raw egg. You can't \"grab it\" you must pick it up with two fingers to avoid hitting buttons you don't want to hit. I carry a camera with me always in a pocket in my bag.  Because of the button issue, I've had to put it in a case, so I don't turn it on from simply jostling the bag.  The camera once turned on when I laid my jacket down and it was comic watching my bag go in and out with the lens pushing it. But that kind of \"accident\" can screw up the lens.  It does not have a natural hand-hold and it's hard to find a comfortable way to grip the camera - and I have small hands - it would be much worse if you have large hands.  The LCD screens - well, there's isn't much great to say here - they are simply inadequate in daylight.  Canon recommends using the viewfinder when in broad daylight because the LCD screen is barely visible, but the viewfinder reads very poorly - you cannot accurately see what your are framing - detail, color, anything close to accurate representation is just not there.  The adjustable lcd screen mechanics are simply magnificent-a feature I was thrilled to have-but viewing it is simply inadequate.  - I just decided tonight that this camera just wasn't good enough for my needs and am ordering the Sony DSC H5.

Color accent allows you to point a little box in the view finder at a chosen color, any pictures taken will only show that color and the rest will be in B&W.; Yes, I know that it can be done in software, but being able to do it on the go is fun and if your like me, you never manage to spend the time with software back at the house to fine tune images.

I'd noticed at Faerieworlds that both the official photographers used Canon equipment - far more advanced than this one, of course. The S5 IS was out then, but I felt the additional features didn't justify going over my limited budget. The price has come down since I bought it, but that always seems to happen, and the photos I got in the meantime are well worth the extra money.I first used the camera at a book signing, and was pleased at the quality of the shots even without flash, and the 12X optical zoom allowed me to get in close. My next event was a Renaissance Faire, and when I got home and looked at the results on my computer, I was very impressed with what the camera allowed me to do. Again, the 12X zoom got me in close and the image stabilization kept things sharp. I had some 8x10s made of a couple of the performers, and they looked fantastic.I've tried out taking movies. The picture quality is good, but I found that wind can really mess with the sound. I shot a brief movie of a juggler, and when the wind wasn't blowing, the mics picked up her patter nicely, but when the wind kicked in, it wiped out all other sound.I've mostly shot in Auto mode, which works well most of the time. It does require being very aware of what the camera is focusing on. At a zoo, I had to play with things a bit to make sure I got the animal subjects in focus, and not the fencing around them.The viewfinder took a little getting used to. I wear glasses, and had to adjust to looking over the top of them to see into the viewfinder clearly. The tilt screen comes in handy for Hail Mary shots or any other situation where you can't shoot with the camera right in front of the eye.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Mercy Ospina \"Merchi O\"", "ReviewID": "R3KS7NMKJBUG1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am completely satisfied with the product, the photos are of high quality and is fairly easy to use and configure.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Emerald Sparc", "ReviewID": "R1D244O4XE1CZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking mainly for a camera with good picture quality and video recording capabilities.

I've taken many pictures near the ocean, and the water comes out a deep blue like it's suppose to do.  My favorite feature is the color accent.My only beef with the camera is the viewfinder.  It really isn't the regular viewfinder as I had expected.  I wanted it just in case I run low on batteries.  I could use the viewfinder instead of the LCD to save energy.  Well the viewfinder is really just a smaller version of the LCD screen.  It works great though if you can't see anything on the regular LCD because of lighting issues.

The S3 has image stabilization and 12x zoom and for a guy who spends two-thirds of his time taking pictures of birds, bees, and butterflies, THIS is the camera! Wait a second: bees and butterflies? Doesn't that take a macro? Yes, but with a 12x optical zoom, you can stand five feet from a flower and, yes, with some software, you could have a picture that is a \"macro\" with any other camera, and blow it up to 11x17. Six MP is plenty. I've had a picture of a tiger (and now a dog)on my web site, and you can count the hairs and whiskers; the bee's pollen sacs are crystal clear.If I can find where to post some pictures, take a look.Some negatives: When you DO use the macro, unlike other Canons, you can't use it in \"Auto.\" That's okay, but the button is now on the side and you have to look for it. And then macro and super macro are very sensitive, and there often isn't enough light for a picture and the flash is too much. Try taking a picture of a coin...For some odd reason, though most of the button are in the same place as on the A620, I hit them accidentally more often and have changed settings though I didn't mean to.Though this isn't exactly a negative, I do wish that I could switch the view setting to the next picture when looking at what's on the card. I don't know how else to explain it, but using the LCD to view your picture AND pulling them in for a close up look, you can't move on to the next shot.So, while I'm at it, I wish it had a 3\" LCD instead of 2. But then, I wish it had a 5\" LCD, weighed 3 ounces, had a 20x optical zoom, and had a viewfinder that anyone with glasses could use. I also want world peace, a lottery hit, and leg room on NWA.Speaking of which...the viewfinder is actually one of the best I've found after 50+ years of taking pictures. It's adjustable, and large enough.I could go on and on, but that would be superfluous considering the preceding reviews by others. It deserves 4.5 stars, and the only reason why not 5 is that we all know the next step is a 15x zoom and 8 MP, not that I need 8 MP.Be sure to get a 1 GB, preferably a 2 GB card, btw. If you take \"movies\" at all, and you use high res, you'll eat up memory like crazy. But even then, you can now use the zoom in movie mode and take snapshots while taking movies.An excellent lens, the Canon 180 degree LCD, ...Enough. It's not point and shoot, and it's not small. It's comfortable, can indeed be used with one hand (hey, I've often got a dog attached to the other), and I just can't praise it enough. Even the price is more than reasonable.

I have a canon s410 which I bought from amazon a couple of years ago that gives great pictures (that was until the dreaded E-18 error) I recently fixed that camera but i wanted a long zoom. I was waiting for the olympus but when I tried it the shot to shot was very slow, I almost could go make a cup of coffee in the time it took to shoot from shot to shot! also at full zoom it dropped the resolution down to 1.2 megapixels!  so I purchased the canon from Amazon for around $300. Its not a bad camera, it does have a learning curve, automatic is probably the worst setting to use, there are a lot of assesories you can buy for it. The pictures come out decent. Although I was disapointed in the low light setting of a dinner I attended, the photos came out grainy, some not usuable at all, the same happend with some outdoor shots on a gray day in ohio (a recent trip)I am hopping that once I learn to use the settings properly I can avoid this in the future. The S5 was just announced but for what you get I dont think it is worth the extra money. It only gives you a few more megapixels on the same size senor, a hotshoe and a bigger screen. In researching this camera I did find one common problem and that is people complain that on a 2 gig card (any card) when you get close to capacity, it hides the photos on the card and they are not readable in a card reader and eventually not even in the camera-disapearing act-I havent experienced this so I dont know if it affects all but i doubt I will fill up my 2 gig card anyway, I use this camera for amusement. I dont want to buy a ton of lenses, if I did I would get a DSLR. I pretty much bought this for the zoom. I have read you should buy a filter to protect the lens which means also buying the adaptor, lensmate seems to make a better one then canon out of metal, I will probably get mine there also the lens cap they sell has a tether to it so you wont loose it. I myself am torn between the 52mm and the 58mm.Some people like sonys better, never owned one so I cant comment. There are also some user forums  where you can learn from others the best settings to use with this camera, [...]Overall a good camera for the 300 range, there are no 5 star digitals it comes down to what you want to use it for and how you take pictures, I dont feel its worth it to spend more then 300 on a camera unless you are in the market for a DSL, and this is no DSL! but I also didnt want to learn how to use a DSL.

I took the camera back (very embarrassing), did a lot of research, and then bought this camera.Here's my take on this Canon PowerShot SI I3 after a few hours of use.1.  The very first shot I took was awesome.  The camera used the flash, but still preserved the natural colors of the scene and eliminated red-eye.  In other words, it shot a picture with a flash that came out looking like it was shot without a flash.2.  You can't just power it up and figure it out.  You have to study the manual and climb the learning curve.  This thing has buttons all over it, and it isn't particular obvious what they do.  Some you press, and some you wiggle back and forth.  There are buttons within buttons.  You'll likely break it if you start fooling with it before you study up.  I'm sure it will take several evenings of intense study to master all the capabilities of this camera.3.  I was glad I bought a multi-year service contract because these controls are made of plastic and I wonder if everything will still be working after three years or so of continual use.4.  Running on four AA batteries is cool!  Get recharable ones with a recharger.  The handle that contains the batteries actually makes the camera easier to hold steady than those slim cute digital camera.5.  Screen is decent size, but the little symbols and abbreviations that appear on the screen are often very tiny and I strain even with my reading glasses at time just to see what all the settings showing on the display.6.  The Set and Menu buttons are too close together.  A thumb (the natural digit to use) can easily push both, or the one you don't want to push.7.  It's nice to be able to go complete manual.  Have fun.8.  Super macro mode is cool.  There's a coin I've been wanting to sell on-line and my other digital camera had a terrible time getting a good picture, but this camera gave me a wonderfully detailed shot in super macro mode and without a lot of work.9.  There's definitely a \"protocol\" to follow when activating and deactivating the camera.  You've got to remove the lens cap, fold out and reverse the screen, then fold it back toward the camera.  (Or, use the display flipped out and swivel it up and down, but be careful while you're doing that).  Reverse the procedure for shut-down.The bottom line is that if you can pay $400 instead of $300 you'll get a whole lot more camera.  This is probably as close to a digital SLR you'll get without actually buying one.  It's not cute or intuitively obvious how to use.  You'll have to become a student of the camera and work on your relationship with this thing.  However, if you do this, your relationship will likely be a long and satifying one.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camara-Terrible Viewfinder", "Author": "Michael D.

I would trust the Canon to any event like weddings, baby pictures, birthdays, etc.It paired immediately with my Macbook Air and there were no problems transferring the files to iPhoto with the cable provided.I like that there is a dedicated button for shooting video.I like that the majority of glowing reviews for this camera mention that this is a well loved camera owned for many years (generally five plus) and that the owner would still pick this camera again over newer/faster/more-bells-and-whistle options available.I did notice the shutter speed is slightly slower than the Lumix but that may have to do with a higher quality ScanDisk card I am using in the Lumix.Still getting to familiar with the features and functions of this camera but so far I'm very pleased with it's performance and would definitely recommend.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "this is \"THE\" camera to own.", "Author": "Rudy L.

Otherwise a very useful camera. The biggest things for me is of course a 12x zoom. I had this camera for about 3 years now, and this zoom let me take amazing pictures. I travel a lot, so 12x zoom helps to take far away pictures, for example out in nature, zoos, beach, parks like Disney World/Land, where it is not an option to be closer to an object. Also the micro focus works very well. You can see my pictures at platonm(dot)com. The 6MP is not really anything to brag about, but 3 years ago, especially for the price I paid ($298.26) it was a good choice. Do not be discouraged by the fact that it needs 4AA batteries. It threw me off at first, but then looking at other options, that combined mega-zoom and low price, there was nothing else. I bought Sony BCG-34HE4 Super-Quick Worldwide Battery Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries for $22.95, and those work forever between charges.

Including using a flash!As all Canons it is simple and easy to use, and since it is higher-end PowerShot it has extra features, like manual/micro focus. The lens focuses nice and fast.

It's a shame you can't have the long zoom and all of the other features this camera has, but give it an optical viewfinder instead.  I guess I could use the LCD display but I'm not at all comfortable with that.  I imagine with time I will do better (hopefully).  This is a nice camera but I admit, I'm a dinosaur.

I thought that $310 was quite a bargan for a camera with all it's features. Had I known that a short time later the next model would come out with, I believe 10 MP, I may have waited. I took some great pictures at Thatcher Park in Altomont, NY while walking a upper trail around the horseshoe canyon. I notice across the canyon a parking area and a sign nearby. So I took a wide angle shot 1st, then went out to all the optical zoom and took a shot and then went all out with digital zoom and even from that distance you could read the sign when I made a 4x6 print of it. I'll never get to use all the bells and whistles it has. One feature I really liked when I took it to Disney was the video capture. Unlike all the other digital cameras I had before this one, I could zoom in while making videos. So I had one camera only, left the HI-8 camcorder at home. My only complaint has come in the last year or so. It seems that every time I try to capture video the camera will only capture around 3-5 minutes at a time. When I read the manual it says I can get up to 2 hours of video on a 2 gig card. I don't remember having this problem when I was in Disney. It could be a flaw in the camera or I may have inadvertently changed a setting. No matter, I just received a Sony digital camcorder as a gift.

I have some good things to say about it, but it has some very serious problems.First, the good:* Fast startup time for a point-and-shoot.* Long zoom lens.  Not the sharpest nor the most distortion-free, but acceptable for its weight and price.* EVF is useful when there is too much sunlight to use the screen.* Lots of features.* Movie mode is quite respectable.* Manual focus is dreadful, but at least they tried.* With an optional adapter it can take filters--I use a polariser quite frequently around the water and while hiking.  The filter+adapter go on and off much faster than the braindead threaded filter design found on SLRs.I've only found one really bad habit, but I regard it as a showstopper:  As with all point-and-shoots, it becomes almost useless above ISO 200--even at ISO 80 you will notice grainy noise.  But the ISO button is positioned about where your nose goes, and you will probably also hit it with your thumb.  I've lost many really good shots by accidentally hitting the ISO button and not noticing that I'd bumped it up too high.I'd also think that with such a huge zoom range they could have worked in the ability to shoot at wider angle and taken a little off the long end.

I purchased the canon lens adapter with hood and got a UV protector filter to protect the camera lens from dust.  The lens hood combined with the uv filter does a nice job of blocking out most of the sunlight to give me nice sharp colorful picture.  Taking action pictures is a tough business because motocross riders are passing you at speeds of 30 - 60 mph and this camera does a great job of capturing them.

I have had 2 people purchase this same camera after trying mine.  I can't say enough great things about this.  If you are looking for a small camera though, this is not for you.

My first digital camera was a little Kodak Easyshare C533. I'm not really sure how to compare the two camera's. The Kodak was very easy and sorta intuitive to learn how to use and was/is a great starter camera. This Canon PowerShot Pro is soooo much more! I love the image stabilisation in it! That was the main thing missing in the little Kodak. And the PowerShots 12x zoom is great for pulling in those long shots and still making them nice and clear and sharp.  There is so much that this camera can do that I will never be able to figure out on my own. I need to find a course someplace to take on how to use it. Or it would be nice if Canon had a instructional DVD on how to use this camera. This camera is definatly not for the beginner, but with  a little practice I'll get it. So far I'm very happy with it.  The 4 battery pack gives it enough power to take lots and lots of pictures before you need to change and recharge them. The Kodak needed the batteries changed after 150 shots or so.  The video function on the Canon is nice too. I like the instant video button that you can use at any time while taking photos without having to change any settings. The color swap function in kinda fun to play with too. All though I haven't got the hang of that yet.  Over all this is a nice camera that I think I will get a lot of use and fun out of.

It makes things so easy!  Just keeping it on  Auto has made some terrific photos, which show what I wanted to show, without having to fight anything.It turns on and off instantly, unlike the camera I replaced with the S3.  It's almost silent.  The noise of taking a picture can be turned on and off, but I like the little noise, so I keep it on. You can also change the noise to something silly like a dog barking, which is amusing.I've started to experiment with the other settings, but even if all I ever used was the Auto and my \"eye\", I'd be happy with this camera.I did consider the S5 because it has a couple more options, but when I tried them out in a store, the S5 was just a little bit bigger, deeper from front to back, and it didn't fit my relatively small hand as well.

The zoom is very powerful, and at the full zoom the image stabilization resulted in sharp pictures taken from a canoe. The macro mode let me take sharp, stable pictures at a distance of just a few inches. Colors are both accurate and vivid.  Battery life is excellent. My only complaint is that there are so many optional shooting modes that I may never master all of them.

I've found only one negative, and its big enough for me to give this 4-star rating instead of 5. This camera, per Canon's website, does not imprint time stamps on photographs. I'm used to storing pictures of my daughter since she's growing up so quickly, and to my wife and I, the time stamp holds great value.

This means the option to get a date through the camera directly is not there, but atleast the software gives you the option. I've used this software since, and have time-stamped several pictures and added text too to some of them in my color of choice.

So this is how the S3 came into my possession.  Except for an increase in the pixels, there are no upgrades.  However, it seemed to me that the diameter of the lens is smaller--I noticed this when looking through view finder.  However, I just measured it and it seems that it not the lens itself, just the lens casing, and perhaps the greater difficulty I had in looking through the view finder is due to to my imagination or vision.  Initially, I saw it as a downgrade and decided to return it, in combination with my annoyance that a product would break just after the warranty expired.However, I agree with others that the video was good in the other one, and I imagine that it is therefore good in this one--did enjoy that.  So I am reconsidering sending it back as my husband likes it, and I liked the 12X zoom, the stabilizer, and the video....On the other hand, I just wonder how long this one will last.It didn't last long.  7 months after I got it, the pixels wore out so I have a blurry spot.  just of out of warranty (it was a refurbished camera that I bought to replace the first one)  I will never buy another Canon camera again after this experience with two poorly made cameras in 2 years.

The reviews on this page did not mention the macro mode in any substantive way--and now I know why. In macro mode, the zoom function is very limited.  Only about a fifth or less of the 12X zoom can be used.  After that, the camera will not focus.  The field of view is about the size of a sunflower, if you are shooting flowers.

I didn't think much of it at the time.As of today (day 5 of the trip), that's all it does, both in the viewfinder and LCD. I can vaguely see the difference between pointing it at a bright light vs a dark area (the screen goes between gray and black), but that's it.All the icons display properly and I can review previously taken photos with no problem.It was never abused in any way - for travel I packed it in the original box with original packing materials, in my carry-on bag, which was with me at all times and never banged or dropped.I must assume the thing was just defective.Now I discover that Canon's warranty only covers it in the US, so they will not fix it here unless I pay for the repair, estimated at half what I paid for it a week ago. The only alternative seems to be to send it back to the US at my expense (the return trip by FedEx will cost 75% what I paid for the camera). I had really looked forward to taking lots of photographs on this trip and now that's ruined unless I outlay a huge amount of extra cash. I am inclined to buy a different camera to replace it rather than take another chance with the S3 IS.Obviously I can't speak to the general reliability of this model, but if you do buy one, make sure you do it well in advance of any overseas trip so you can make sure it's not a dud.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "C.

LOVE that it has a eyehole viewfinder for those bright days that you cant see the screen all that well. Love the feel of the camera in general and all of its cool extra features --- but, that lens cap is a piece of crap! I tried and tried to get a new one, but none of them fit this camera... then i purchased a few extra lenses and the extention to put them on the camera... the lens cap problem was solved then! BUT, you have to KEEP the extention and extra lenses on it all the time if you want the protection! UGH! Then it's a pain to carry around! OH, and not to mention... that extention doesnt work so well if you are using the flash! The flash on the camera doesnt pop up tall enough to clear the extention!!! AND - you can not add a Hot SHoe to this camera to solve that problem... about 2 months after i bought this one, a friend of mine showed up with the S5 i think and hers had a Hot Shoe adapter! UGH (after 6 months of research, the one thing that i wanted that i finally gave up on, came out about a month after my purchase!!!) So, with out the hot shoe flash, you wind up with a shadow \"ring around\" your pic - which looks cool in some pics -- but sometimes you really want the whole shot!I have virtually quit using this camera now - b/c i am so frustrated with carrying it around in a professional's sized bag - since i have to keep the extention on it... I bought a tiny poliroid camera that has most of the same features... but they are just a little harder to use --- the thing i love about my polaroid that this camera doesnt have is that you can actually crop a pic right after you take it! So now I am looking for a replacement camera for this cannon... i want to be able to add a lens when i want - but i Dont want to have to keep it on there all the time just to protect the lens b/c i cant buy a new lens cap...Long story short... try one of the newer versions of this camera if you are really intrested in this one!!

Wingard \"The Music Maven\"", "ReviewID": "R3DNV3QARWPMRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have recently decided to update my digital camera. I have been using the Canon A40 since 2002 and have been largely very satisfied with it (see my review and photos for the A40). The Canon S3 for me is the logical upgrade. I haven't purchased it yet but it was my favorite after examining the data on the Panasonic, Sony, and Kodak competitors. Well, after returning from a little time at the stores to get a feel for the various cameras, I have a couple things I think might be useful to other searchers that I would like to share:The Canon S3 is the most unintuitively designed camera in its general class. I thought the A40 was overly complicated and the S3 is worse. It has poor ergonomics but is better ergonomically than the Sony H2/H5 which I felt was nearly impossible to use one-handed. The Kodak Z710 was absolutely the best design with intuitive buttons and a wonderful feel in hand. I have fairly large hands but I found it very comfortable to hold and also had no problem taking photos with one hand or changing the settings. Yes, I like a camera that takes quality pictures but I don't want to be fumbling so long with settings that I lose the joy of a spontaneous moment of beauty either. Regretfully, the noise on the Koadak Z710 was unbearable to me even at ISO 100- worse than the noise on my old Canon A40 with it's relatively less substantial 2 MP resolution and 3X optical zoom. I just can't buy a camera that takes worse pictures than my outdated Canon A40 (the photos I've taken with the A40 beat out a lot of those taken with cameras I am reviewing here).The viewfinder of the Canon S3 is extremely dark as other reviewers have said and I found it absolutely impossible to use. It does have a lot of bells and whistles- some of which are entirely useless (menu themes!?!) and some which are highly attractive (color accent and color swap). The camera does produce some beautiful photographs with the excellent color that Canon is known for.If you can get past the two-handed photography and the viewfinder which protrudes uncomfortably past the camera body, the Sony H2 is an excellent choice. Depth of field is not as nice as with the Canon but the photos are still near professional quality and I know many happy users personally who wouldn't trade it for any other on the market.I have not been able to field test any of the competing Panasonic models, namely because I have been to 4 large retailers and one camera shop, none of which carry any of the Panasonic FZ series. I do have to say though that I am very attracted to the Leica lenses- very high quality lenses used in the manufacture of medical research equipment. And I've seen some absolutely amazing professional quality photos come out of them. If any of you out there in Amazonia have an idea where I can find a retailer that has the Panasonic FZ series cameras, please comment.If the engineers at Canon would have streamlined the Canon S3, it would be in the mail right now but with its ergonomic design shortcomings and higher price, I simply have to take a harder look at it's competitors.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "No Real Difference Between The S2 and S3!!

I was reading many reviews with comments on poor picture quality in low light settings and similar, but I think it is just matter of practice and knowledge. As per my experience, if you put camera in low light settings and put the flash on, pictures are very good.Camera like Canon S3 IS requires you to go through the manual and make yourself familiar with many of its options.Adjustable LCD viewfinder is very helpful especially if you are taking pictures above your height/sight of to low.Personally, I would like for the flash to open itself automatically, rather than manual. Another thing that I would like is for the pictures to be dated.

Gastia", "ReviewID": "R3YZQXJNLIX34", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera in February of this year so I've been using it for about six months. My other camera is a Canon EOS Rebel 35mm SLR which I've had for years and love. The film processing was getting expensive though, so I decided to try a digital. I did have a Kodak digital camera several years ago but it was past it's usefulness and was taking horrible pictures. I was not able to afford a new digital SLR but wanted more than a point-and-shoot. When I found this camera I thought it would be a great compromise and the price was really reasonable.Having had an SLR I did not think it would take too long to get used to this camera. I was wrong. Six months into it and simple things like focusing are still frustrating me. I read another review which mentioned this; I have missed so many shots because this camera cannot decide what to focus on.For example, recently I had a perfect shot of a bee on a flower- I swear he was posing for me- and for almost 5 full minutes (it was a patient bee)I tried every conceievable picture mode and every time the camera would just not be able to focus the way I wanted it to. It would focus for a second and then when I clicked to take the shot it would blur out of focus. Even in Macro mode I was unable to get a decent picture. Every shot is fuzzy or overexposed. The same goes for any indoor pictures I take. I've also noticed that any movies I try making indoors always have a blue hue which I find odd.My frustration may partially be due to my unwillingness to read through the entire manual (I have skimmed). However, in my defense, I am not completely inexperienced with cameras and one would think that unless this was a hightly specialized professional camera (which it is not!) anyone familiar with SLR cameras should be able to figure it out fairly easily.If I do eventually realize that my frustration is due to something I'm doing wrong, I will update my review.

I was origingall impressed with the quality of the photos and all the bells and whistles on this camera.  Worked great for about 4 years with my only occasional use, such as on infrequent vacations and Christmas time photos. Then, this past Christmas I tried to use it at the family gathering at our home and noticed the LCD wouldn't work as it was supposed to and you couldn't see or take photos.  I changed batteries assuming that was the issue. It wasn't.  I rechecked all settings and spend hours and hours going through the manual and double checking all the settings.  Nothing worked.  A visit to the Cannon Site was no help, I finally got through to customer service if you could call it that, and was told that the life expectancy on this camera is over ! 4 years and it's Done ???  I asked about sending it in for repairs and was told that Cannon no longer services this camera and the best they could do was offer me a minimal amout off a replacement upgrade.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I asked him to repeat it and he did.  They no longer repair these units and the life expectancy or any digital camera they sell is only 5 years max. No more service or repairs after that.I have a 10-12 year old Olympus Digital Camera that I blew the dust off and put batteries in, and it still works fine, and thus has lasted more than twice as long as the Cannon and is still going strong.This was the last Overpriced Cannon I or my family will ever buy.  - Customer Service????

S. Henderson", "ReviewID": "R2OM0M21O1MGJV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I decided to get an ultra-zoom digital camera this summer.  After many weeks of reading online reviews and visiting electronics and camera shops, I finally decided to order the Canon S3 when the price finally fell to under 400 dollars.  I have had the camera for two weeks now, and I must admit that I do not understand what all the glowing reviews are about.  The camera is not terrible, but it is cluttered with tiny, flimsy buttons marked with icons or abbreviations that are not at all intuitive.  It is virtually impossible to hold the camera without hitting one of them by accident.  The manual is incredibly frustrating.  This is not a minor problem.  Nearly every entry has a parenthetical reference or footnote telling you to jump to another page.  When you do find what you are looking for, it is usually written in the defective, non-native English that has become all too common in product manuals these days.  I suppose the camera has all the wonderful options, settings, and features that I've read about hidden somehwere behind all those buttons or in all those menus and sub-menus, but I'll never figure out where they are or how to use them from this horrible manual.  The LCD screen is OK, but smaller in reality than it seemed in the store.  The viewfinder is perhaps the most disappointing feature of the camera.  The resolution is very poor.  The image is so heavily pixelated and fuzzy that I have no idea if the subject is in focus or not.  As others have pointed out, the lens cap is cheap and falls off for no apparent reason.  I didn't realize how annoying this would be.  Even at the reduced price, this just should not happen. Most of the pictures that I have taken using the factory settings are OK, but not that much better than my old 3-megapixel Pentax Optio point-and-shoot model.  Overall, I am not completely disgusted by the camera, but, so far, I feel no great enthusiasm for picking it up and using it.

And zooming would be more seamless were it so and not jumpy (as in the difference between digital and analog). An eye cup would be nice to block out the real world while peeking thru my viewfinder. I added the extension tube and lens shade which protects the front element of the lens and gives me something to hold onto when carrying the camera in my hand and shooting; I'm told it looks sexy as hell too (wish that rubbed off on the holder).
