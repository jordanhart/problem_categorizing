I only recommend it to photographers with some experience otherwise your not going to enjoy the fun capabilities. If you have a DSLR camera, great, this his will be the next biggest thing you have in your arsenal because you will want to take this everywhere with you, being so compact. As a result you will most likely take more photographs with it.The fact that this camera is more affordable I now own way more lens than I could with a DSLR and I love it! There are some trade offs like image size but they are practically not an issue.I actually had this camera (in black) and it was stolen from me, it was insured thankfully and I got a new one (in white) and I love it even more.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004A8ZQJI"}}
