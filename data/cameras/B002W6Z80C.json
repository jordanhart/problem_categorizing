{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply the best fixed lens advanced camera", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R1PVC17P4OMOUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ricoh GRD3 is an advanced fixed lens compact camera and also the best Ricoh compact camera up to date. Ricoh GRD belong to the famous Ricoh GR line, which features fixed wide angle lens equivalent to 28mm with big aperture.This product philosophy is pretty straightforward, it is designed and engineered for serious photographers. Every buttons, features, and menu interface are designed to be easily accessible for photographers. Aufo focus performance is excellent.  This combination ensures photographers to be able to capture the decisive moment when it occurs.BODY & HANDLINGRicoh GRD3 is made by magnesium alloy body, very lightweight but very sturdy. It has a big leather-like texture in the hand grip and a bit on the back of the camera. The ergonomic is excellent. It is very comfortable even for a long period of time. The grip make it easier for photographer to keep the camera steady to prevent camera shake/blurred image.Ricoh GRD3's body  interface are the best interface for compact camera. Here is why:First, it has many dedicated buttons, two dials, and up-down button in a very thoughtful design. All the buttons are very accessible.Second, most  of the buttons are customizable. There are two customizable function buttons. In addition, the up-down button and the two dials can be customized in certain way to fit your prefered shooting style. There is also a ADJ. button, which is also function as a customizable button.Mode dial is positioned far top right of the camera with a dial lock. The lock prevented the mode dial to be changed accidentally. GRD3 also has three custom mode dials that can be customized. For example, MY1 for general outdoor shooting, MY2 for low light shooting, MY3 for macro shooting, etc.This kind of body interface usually only available on high-end digital SLR cameras. But even that, I doubt there are any high-end dSLR cameras that offers wide range of customization option that GRD3 offers.When using a camera, most of photographers are forced to adapt to the  camera interface, but in GRD3, you can tailor fit it into your style. With practical experience, you will find which kind of setting is the best for you.OPERATION & AUTO FOCUSRicoh GRD3 starts-up time is 2 seconds and off-time is around 3 seconds which are not very fast, but not the slowest. The operation is generally smooth. Regarding Auto focus system. This camera has the usual multi-focus and spot focus (focus on the center). Focusing speed are moderately fast at around half a second. AF noise is very quiet. You can only hear the faint swirling noise clearly when you are very close to the camera in a quiet room.Ricoh has several rather unique AF features. Here is some unique AF features:Pre-AF = When this feature is activated, the camera will performs auto focus automatically when you start pointing on a scene. This will make auto focus operation a lot faster.Snap-AF = This is basically bypassing auto focus. You set the focus distance (GRD3 offers 1m, 2.5m, 5m and infinity). When this setting activated, you just click away without having to wait. Because shutter lag is almost 0 sec. You will able to capture the frame instantaneously.GRD3 also provides depth of field guideline for each aperture in the LCD screen, so you can make sure that your subject will be in focus. The Snap AF works well in digital compact camera with small sensor because the depth of field are large. So the possibility of getting sharp picture is a lot larger than in digital SLR cameras.There is also a focus confirmation lamp positioned right to the hot shoe. This is very effective when you use external viewfinder as a compositional tool. The AF lamp will provide focus confirmation. The lamp also serves as camera processing indicator.Missing from GRD3 auto focus is the ability to move the move the spot focus to other part of the frame. There is manual focus that allow you to enlarge / zoom the center portion of the scene, which is helpful when you deal with macro photography, but it is not adequate for normal range of photography because the magnification is only around 2-3 times. and it is only in center of the screen.IMAGE QUALITY AND NOISE IN HIGH ISOImage quality is excellent in advanced compact camera class. Shooting in low ISO (200 or lower), it is hard to find the difference the result between this camera with digital SLR camera which has much bigger sensor unless you zoom in to 100%. Dynamic range (the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of an image) is generally good, but around 1 stop lower than digital SLR camera. The camera has adjustable dynamic range expansion (weak, medium, strong) which will help to optimized your image with special algorithm.To deal with dynamic range problem, Ricoh GRD3 has a feature called Double Snap, this feature will take two images consecutively and combine them together to expand the dynamic range. This features are great to bring up shadow details, but you will need tripod for good result because just a bit shake in the process, then the end image will be blurry.Image in high ISO are also excellent for compact camera. It is very usable up to ISO 800 and 1600 is acceptable for small print or web. Colors and saturation are retained even in highest ISO. [Check the ISO / noise comparison in my website]VIDEO MODEDo not expect miracle from GRD3 video mode. This camera is intended for still photography so video mode is very basic, but will be useful for quick snap and web sharing.SOME PERCEIVED WEAKNESSES  * It is easy to accidentally press the the up and down button (usually use for zoom)  * Spot focus limited to center of the frame only. It is not moveable like other advanced compacts.  * Manual zoom magnification should be greater and also movable to other part of the frame (not only center).  * A bit slow processing when shooting in RAW files (approx. 2 sec each), although you can shoot 5 frames continuously at 2 fps.  * Double Snap feature does not give you control over exposure or other setting.  * Need tripod to get Double Snap feature to work well.  * No image stabilization. This is understandable because the size of the camera could be larger. Also, the high ISO performance and bright lens will suffice in low light condition.  * No scene modes or face detection. This camera is not aimed for casual / family compacts market.  * Tele converter lens is not available.  * Small image sensor, while closest competitors already move to DSLR quality sensorCOMPETITORSPeople that looking for Ricoh GRD3 might also consider:Sigma DP1 14MP Digital Camera $550DP1 uses 14.6 megapixel FOVEON sensor (effective 4.6 mp), and  28 mm  f/4 lens.Sigma DP2 14MP FOVEON CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 2.5 Inch TFT LCD $650DP1 uses 14.6 megapixel FOVEON sensor (effective 4.6 mp), and 40 mm f/2.8 lens.

It is has the best interface and ergonomic compared to its rivals. Image quality is very good considering GRD2 has small CCD sensor. The new 28mm f/1.9 is great. Low light performance and image quality are very good. AF operation are excellent and very innovative. For so long, compact cameras always have problem with slow focusing. With this system, you can bypass the AF with Snap or pre-AF mode.Of course, Ricoh GRD3 is not for everybody, because it only has 28mm fixed lens, not zoom lens, and it lacks consumer friendly features such as face detection, scene modes and photo retouch. However, this camera is ideal for people who  understand about basic photography. The focusing features, size and image quality make this camera ideal for street photography.Overall, Ricoh GRD3 is a remarkable camera in such a small package. It sports everything the serious photographer will love, not only fancy features as marketing gimmicks. Highly Recommended!Subjective Rating - Relative to advanced compact camera in 2009Image Quality : 4/5Features : 4/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 5/5Value for Money : 4/5", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ricoh vs. Canon high noon", "Author": "Strohmian", "ReviewID": "R1NHUXHS4F8K0S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera belongs to what I've seen called \"enthusiast compacts\". It appeals to people who are ready to spend a little more and are not easily blinded by number of pixels, 10x zooms, or software trinkets. The ticket of entry is a sensor that measures at least 1/1.8\" (as opposed to the standard 1/2.5\" which is HALF the size, area- wise, once you do the math!), resolves no more than 10 megapixels, and provides a RAW mode. This Ricoh camera passes muster, and one-ups the competition by having a prime (i.e. zoomless) lens - a ballsy but very promising choice.To a quality- minded photographer, the specs already are very much in favor of this camera. And if you compare it to your three year- old $129 Target special, you're going to be thrilled in every respect. But the real question is: How does it stand up against the competition in its own class? To determine that, I'm going to pit the Ricoh against what has been termed \"king of the compacts\" not so long ago, the Canon S90. At a lower price and with a (quality-wise) inferior zoom lens, the Canon should bite the dust in every respect. Does it? Read on for the shootout or skip to 'Unique features' and 'Conclusion' for the skinny.ERGONOMICSThe Ricoh is about 25% larger than the S90 (by volume), but it's still a rather small camera. I find it considerably easier to hold, thanks to finger- friendly bulges and the textured shell. At first glance, the Canon looks like a worthier camera with its sleek metal finish, but the Ricoh's textured body will most likely withstand a little abuse and it doesn't collect any fingerprints. Both camera bodies are solid - no creaking or crackling here. Also, both have a very nice 3\" screen and the difference is slight, but the Ricoh's seems to have better contrast, less reflections, and better colors outdoors. Probably not something I'd have noticed if I didn't have both cameras out at the same time. But in my mind, the Ricoh has better ergonomics than the Canon.UNIQUE FEATURESThe one big thing that Canon has and the Ricoh is lacking is image stabilization (IS). That is particularly useful for taking flash- free pictures of inanimate objects, such as in a museum, or bring out the background in reasonably calm subjects. The Canon IS gives you a 3- stop advantage which makes a huge difference in low light situations. Speaking of low light, the S90 takes up to 30s exposures in Tv mode (Ricoh: 5s). It has face detection, the only software gadget I'd rate useful since it can save the day when you give the camera to a stranger to snap a pic of you. And finally, if you happen to be a Scuba diver, you know that Canon owns the underwater world: there are 3 different enclosures available for the S90 and none for the Ricoh.On the Ricoh positive side, we have a flash hot shoe, the iris goes down to f/9 (canon: f/8), and a built- in tilt sensor. Also the lens connector is threaded, so with an optional adapter you can mount standard filters. There is an interval setting, and in macro mode you can get so close you have to watch out not to poke your subject! I've also noticed that the battery lasts a long time on standby: after 2 months of not taking pictures the Canon is dead, but the Ricoh shows full.All in all, it's impossible to weigh one feature over the other as it depends so much on what the camera is being used for.. so I call it a tie (but for the record, I'm totally pouting over the missing IS).OPERATIONBoth cameras have mode dials with the usual suspects (A/Tv/M/P) plus custom modes. The controls are very different: On the Ricoh, there is a wheel, and two levers to control various settings, whereas the canon uses two rings, one of which on the lens. I may be a little biased here because I've been using the Canon far longer, but the ring around the lens is absolutely genious and always seems to do the right thing (for example, sets ISO in P mode but shutter speed in Tv mode). In addition, one click on 'function' brings up a tidy menu with shooting- relevant items, such as ISO, whitebalance, etc., all with pretty and intuitive icons. On the Ricoh, the \"Adj.\" lever seems to have no effect most of the time, the \"up\" button is unmapped, and the shooting menu isn't particularly clean as it contains all the options (eg. \"noise reduction\", \"date imprint\") in textual form, so it might take you a while to find the proper setting while your subject is waiting. On the other hand, the Ricoh is more customizable, with 3 custom notches on the mode dial and two \"Fn\" buttons. Perhaps with practice, the Ricoh will feel more comfortable, but for now, I'm giving Canon the medal for thought- out operation.SOFTWAREThis is a somewhat unfair comparison, as Canon bundles its DPP software with the S90, the same product as with their $5000 SLRs. And they've had at least 8 years to perfect it. Can you tell that I'm trying to ease you into the fact that I like DPP, whereas Ricoh's bundled software, \"Irodio\", leaves me wanting? Don't get me wrong, Irodio is not awful. It shows the pictures like on a slide desk, you can set the white point, crop and flip, and it doesn't crash THAT much more often than DPP.. and yet: no tagging, fine rotate, tone curve control, batch export, and weirdest of all, no zoom (that I could figure out)! Irodio's saving grace is that it has limited video clip support, something that DPP completely ignores. And luckily, the Ricoh uses the open DNG format which Adobe's Lightroom digests, but that's some serious extra money. The bundled software award goes to Canon, loud and clear.PICTURE QUALITYRicoh specifically highlights the optical characteristics of the prime lens, and let's be clear, it's why people would buy this camera. Of course I don't have a lab at my disposal, so a real- world test would have to do: I took a picture in good lighting conditions and compared a crop in the center as well as on the edge. In addition, I took a picture in low light and ISO 800. I invite you to peruse the pictures here on Amazon, don't take my word for any of this :)  But, here's my critique:On the center shot, I think things are pretty even. If I was pressed, I'd vote for the Ricoh as I like the colors better and I believe I could count more grass leaves. On the edge shot, Ricoh also has the advantage and less chromatic aberration (blue fringes). However, to be honest I did expect a little more. As it is, the difference is not all that great: you'd have to print above 12\" x 9\" to see any difference in detail, and the fringing in particular can easily be fixed in Software. Finally, at ISO 800 the Ricoh has no noise advantage over the S90 - neither compact should be used at that sensitivity.CONCLUSIONThis is a solid point-and-shoot that appeals to people who want the little (little!) extra in picture quality, or a feature not commonly seen in this class (see 'unique features' above).. The advantage over the (zooming) mainstream competition is slim though, and the two major issues that may irk the aspiring photographer are the missing image stabilizer and the mediocre software.OPTIONSI'd like to stress the fact that this is still a \"point-and-shoot\" class camera, with all the shortcomings: in terms of picture quality, handling, speed, or versatility it can't hold a candle to even my 6- year old DSLR! Make no mistake: for someone looking to capture an event or children growing up around the house, any inexpensive DSLR from Nikon or Canon will be around the same price, yet many times superior in all aspects - except size.If it has to be small (a valid requirement, as the saying goes \"the best camera is the one you have on you\"), direct competitors include Canon who recently announced the S95. One big step up is the Micro Four- Thirds system such as Olympus' or Panasonic's current offerings. Also, it's worth noting that Sony's NEX5 has made quite a splash recently as well, as its picture quality comes close to DSLR's.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ricoh GR DIGITAL III Digital Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "Loves Books in MD", "ReviewID": "R3SE8RQ9RW9T6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ricoh digital point and shoot cameras aren't your traditional point and shoot cameras.  Take the GR III, it's not the smallest or doesit have the longest zoom lens or is it the cheapest.  Actually, it's pretty pricey. And it's not for everyone.  And if I hadn't gotten it for free, I wouldn't have bought it. But now that I have had some time to use it, I really like it.As I said above, this isn't the smallest camera. It's considerably bigger than the newer Canon SD series. However, it will comfortably fit in a shirt pocket. It is also quite a bit heavier. The body appears to be of metal with a rubber covered grip.  The grip is nice sized and very comfortable. There is a nice 3\" LCD on the back for composing and viewing images.  As has become the norm on P&S; cameras, there isn't an optical viewfinder. On the top, there is the typical power button, shutter release, and mode dial. A nice little feature is that the mode dial locks so that it can't change settings accidently. Also on top is a hot shoe for using an external flash. You almost never see this on a camera this small. The camera also has a small built in flash.On the subject of a zoom lens, there isn't one.  The GRIII comes with a fixed 28mm (35 equivalent), fast f1.9 lens. Why no zoom lens? My guess is that Ricoh went for quality here (and they achieved it). This wide angle lens is great for landscapes, shooting around the house, street photography, and macro shots. And with the fast f1.9 aperture, you can easily control the depth of field to blur the background if desired.The camera has many shooting features. Some, like Snap Focus, the leveling aid, and High contrast B&W; mode are not found on any other P&S; cameras. I recommend you download the manual (available on Ricoh's website) and read up on these if you're thinking of getting this camera.For me, the most important aspect of a P&S; is image quality. Due to the small sensor size, you get more noise and less detail than digital SLRs. In P&S; cameras, there are two basic sizes. The smallest (the one in most P&S; cameras) and a slightly larger one that is found in the bigger sized point and shoot cameras. The larger one is found in the bigger Canon G11, G12, and Nikon s7000 cameras. As I write this, there are only 3 really pocketable cameras that use the bigger sensor... the Canon S90, its replacement the S95, and this camera. In this case size does matter. The larger sensor gives you a lot less noise and better detail. Couple this with the Ricoh's lens and very good image processing engine, and you end up with images that are better than most. I've been happy with 13 x 19 inch prints and probably could go bigger. Is it as good as a digital SLR? No, but it close and nowhere near as big and heavy.In conclusion, this camera is not for everyone.  The casual shooter taking holiday pictures would be better served by a smaller, cheaper point and shoot. But if you normally use a wide angle lens, want a lot of shooting features, and the highest image quality you can get in a pocketable camera, give this a look.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Desirable niche camera", "Author": "ebull \"ebull\"", "ReviewID": "R1C2QQN4A32W1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ill keep this short.

I fall somewhere in the middle, meaning I really enjoy photography but I admit I am also a bit of a gadget nut, hence buying all these similar cameras in hopes of finding a REAL winner STANDOUT. Now that THAT'S out of the way, to my review..No matter what, any small advanced point and shoot camera even with the larger sensor like the GR3 just can't equal a micro four or dslr type sensor OVERALL.That said this is about a camera you want to take with you, while your larger compact or dslr sits home.The long story short on this GR3 at least to me is, It's extremely customizable, you can control just about everything under the sun with it. I loved the controls..it feels great in hand..and it really is just an excellent no frills camera. That's exactly what I wanted. I knew full well it had a fixed lens, no hd video etc. Yes the lens does seem to be BEST out of all the cameras in this category as to overall sharpness(corner to corner), hardly any chromatic aberration etc. BUT!..So you get all this control, over just about every aspect of taking a shot GREAT. But, and here's BUT again, when I used exact same settings, aperture, ev, iso, distance to shot, lighting etc, when all is equal I found the Ricoh actually fell a bit short of my s95 and tl500 oddly enough. I did tests as to overall IQ, Sharpness, dynamic range, SKIN TONES etc. The GR3 is really GREAT but I don't see it besting the TL500 or S95 OVERALL. One big plus it does have IS the lens..there is absolutely much less purple fringing with the GR3 than my other similar cameras. BUT again but? OVERALL, the other cameras actually look more sharp as to FOCUS, do better in low light, have a zoom, at least it's there as an option. I actually like the idea of a fixed lens camera as it makes you work harder for the shot and if you have legs..YOU DO have a zoom. :) BUT other than purple fringing, or extreme corner to corner sharpness it's nice to have the option of a zoom. Say you are shooting, and a cute little rabbit appears cause this just happened to me while shooting. Well you can't run towards the rabbit..I was happy I had my s95 with me got the shot. With the Ricoh my little rabbit was just too far away..hence I missed that shot. IF the gr3 was so much better than these other cameras, image quality means everything to me.I'd rather miss my little rabbit shot for example on the overall. But picture after picture side by side, I kept seeing the gr3 was not a standout vs these other cameras sad to say. Yes it doesn't blow out highlights quite as much as the s95..but that's when YOU take control..so with a little ev compensation...so what. AND the Ricoh DOES blow highlights. The gr3 had no greater dynamic range vs the other cameras...it DOES have the best battery life by FAR. But here's But again, so buy a second battery with the $100 to $200 you can save on a TL500 or S95. To sum up, so you get a TON of control..but due to it's tiny sensor you can do JUST so much with these little guys. On overall everything I found the gr3 a great little camera but REALLY other than the purple fringing or lack of..it really in no way stood out any better than the other cams in this category. No Image stabilization (Another limitation here) is a drag unless you want to pump up iso indoors then you get a lot of noise obviously. Forgot to mention ALSO owned the XZ-1 but sold it cause it had WAY WAY too much noise reduction. I do use raw too..but HAVING TO HAVE to use raw on every picture (like you need do with the XZ-1)had me selling my xz-1. To sum up the GR3 is indeed an excellent camera, built very well (though made in China) BUT, love that BUT, it really seems too expensive for what you get...so sadly I'm going to be selling mine.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Forget any lack of optical zoom, it's got Great Image Quality!", "Author": "S. M. Robare \"smurfwreck\"", "ReviewID": "R16Z3PG1K9LS5N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I like to approach my digital camera reviews from the point of view of a novice since I'm far from a tech geek and ease of use is typically on the top of my mind.  That said, the Ricoh GR Digital III is a pretty amazing camera for being so compact.  It's overall user-friendly and intuitive functions matched with pretty darn good image quality is quickly setting it apart from most of the digital cameras I've used in the past.As far as what's great about this camera, the thing that really jumps out at me is the image quality, in particular in moderate low light.  My experience with most digital cameras while shooting inside with moderate lighting has been that the flash was a necessity to capture any decent detail and to prevent high pixilation.  This has been an issue in the past because it's hard to use the flash well indoors at close range without overexposing the image.  With the Ricoh GR D III I was able to capture medium-high, to high quality pictures with no flash indoors.  Also, the Macro function image quality is amazing indoors in medium light.The other thing that really surprised me was the ease of use right out of the box.  I had the camera unpacked with the included battery installed (it already had a 2/3 full charge) and was literally taking pictures in 3 minutes.  The menu and function navigation is super intuitive for anyone even moderately comfortable with basic digital cameras (I'm assuredly a novice in that department.)  I was able, without the manual, to figure out how to turn on/off the macro and flash, change the image quality settings, adjust the focus options (turning on/off multi or single box focus, etc.), as well as playing back the images and even switching to video mode.As far as drawbacks go, the main issue I think will bug most people is the lack of any true optical zoom.  The camera does have a 4x digital zoom, but honestly I've never been a fan of the large quality reduction digital zoom imparts.  Even though the camera lacks zoom, I don't see this as an issue as the camera seems designed for more on the go snapshots, and the overall picture quality makes up for slightly less versatility.My only real complaint about the camera is in the left side body design.  Though overall the camera is easy to use with just the right hand, it's hard to find a good place to hold it with your left because the LCD screen is flush on that side and there's only a thin border to rest your thumb.  Also because the flash is flush with the top left it prohibits a good grip when it's in use.  It's a minor quibble, but it's worth noting none the less.All in all, it's a little pricy for an on-the-go camera, but the image quality and ease of use put it light years above lower priced compact digital cameras.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb camera for a more advanced user.", "Author": "MTurney", "ReviewID": "R3VQ61U8XBICPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Ricoh GRD III (like the GRD I) that I owned before is a superb little camera, capable of taking excellent images in the hands of an experienced photographer.

Even in the hands of a forever amateur like this Potato Head, the Ricoh can produce some magnificent images though many are the results of dumb luck and a smart camera.Like a previous reviewer, I started taking pictures as soon as I charged up the battery. My poor dogs no doubt wondered why that black box was constantly in their faces, but they were good sports. With no zoom lens one is forced to get close to his/her subject, a good thing in most cases. When I couldn't get too close because of logistics or because I wanted to use the flash, I did some severe cropping to still achieve good quality pictures.Likes-The size and feel of the camera. It has enough heft to feel comfortable in the hands, yet is small enough to fit in a pocket or small case.The owner's manual.  A printed manual is included, an appreciated inclusion for his user. The manual is amply illustrated and easy to understand. It's a bit lengthy because of the complexity and the number of features that come with the camera. Though the scenes are limited compared to many other cameras of this size, the customization options for buttons and settings are nearly limitless. Using the P,S, M, A, and three my scene buttons, one can have seven preconfigured combinations to use on picture expeditions.Speed - The Ricoh focuses quickly and processes quickly, even in RAW mode. If one loses a shot, it most likely won't be the camera's fault.  Learning the camera's settings and menu goes a long way in adding to the speed and comfort of using the camera. I learn a little more each time I use the camera.Low light pictures - I've seldom had to use the flash because of the Ricoh's sensitivity. Even in a bedroom lit with an overhead fluorescent light, I got good color and detail after adjusting the white balance settings.  Macro pictures are terrific, most with good color and clarity of detail.The more I use and learn about this camera, the more impressed I become. Pictures taken in low light without a flash are incredible.The dynamic range feature is nice;  in scenes with extremes of dark and light the camera takes two pictures and combines the best of both. The owner's guide recommends using a tripod, but I'd had some good results with hand held shots.  I especially like the \"vivid\" setting. Pictures taken in this mode are vibrant yet not unnatural or too intense as with other cameras in this setting.Video - I like the ease of using the video via the scene mode setting on the dial. Both indoor and outdoor videos have turned out well with excellent sound. The built in microphone is quite sensitive, so try not to hurt its feelings.Battery life - I've taken lots of pictures so far and haven't had to quit because of a dead battery. Conveniently this camera can use the included Ricoh lithium rechargeable or ubiquitous AA batteries.Other thoughts -  As a point and shoot kind of picture taker, I would have liked some available zoom and maybe a few more scene settings. One can't attach filters to this camera, but there is an available attachment from Ricoh that includes a hood and allows the user to add filters.I like being able to fine tune the settings to taste whether it's white balance, brightness, exposure, color, sharpness, or things I haven't learned about or stumbled upon yet.The included Ricoh software is good, with lots of features and intuitive layout. When adding effects, however, the program can plod along slowly while the effects are added. After taking both RAW and jpeg pictures, I prefer to use the fine jpeg setting.Value - Over six hundred dollars seems quite a bit for a camera like this, but then again I am a frugal picture taker, not a photographer. However, several photographers of my acquaintance have also reacted with raised eyebrows when informed of the Ricoh's price tag. Read the descriptive details about the Ricoh on the Amazon page and other sites to see that quite a lot is packed into this little camera.  For some, the included features and ergonomic pluses will be enough to justify the Ricoh's cost.For me the Ricoh wouldn't be the best every day camera, but for those who want a small camera for good, spur of the moment photos, or  for photos of  people, pets, or baby people in no flash situations, the Ricoh GR might be ideal.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "The BEST compact available", "Author": "Dan Bennett", "ReviewID": "R11CH6M7JUC3UK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best compact camera PERIOD.

Currently I have been using a canon s90, which I have really loved. The blend of size, features and quality have made it a great camera. That is, until I got this camera.First, this isn't a camera to get someone who wants a simple point and shoot camera. While you can use it for that, it is far more capable in the hands of someone who is willing to use its advanced features. Plus, its price is going to put off a lot of people. But once you get past the sticker shock, and spend a little time reading the manual you will find that this little camera packs a lot of features and quality into a very ergonomic package.The body does not have the normal cheapy feel that is so common with inexpensive digital cameras. This is made out of a magnesium alloy. This keeps it not only pretty light, but also very strong.Also, the button layout is very thoughtful right from the beginning. But they can be customized to better serve your needs.This is also a pretty fast camera. I did notice that it shooting RAW did slow things down a little, but I think that is common among many cameras of this type.What you won't find with this camera is some of the gimmicky features that many cameras have (scene modes, face detect, image stabilization). This may or may not be a deal breaker for buyers.But even with out that, the picture quality can make up for the lose of little features, which may or may not even be important to you.For me, this is a great camera for someone who is willing to invest the time in learning about the manual modes of the camera.

It has only been in the last couple of years that I have really started taking a lot of pictures.  I will admit it was mostly at the prompting of a photographer friend who told me the key to taking great pictures is to take loads of them - some are bound to turn out great.  I should not have been surprised that she was correct, but I was thrilled to find that I was getting some really good shots.  So while I do take more pictures, I am a lazy photographer.  What I mean is that I don't want to study manuals or spend hours fiddling with settings, I just want to be able to point and shoot.That is why this camera was intimidating to me at first.  It LOOKS really complicated.  I set it aside for a bit and vowed that I would (this time) read the manual before using.  I REALLY meant to do it.  But, like I said, I am a LAZY photographer and could never work up the courage to open the manual.  I finally just forced myself to just pick it up and use it.To my surprise, it was easy to use.  As long as you have used a camera before, it is pretty intuitive.  My simple point-and-shoot technique has turned out some greater than usual pictures, so I can only assume it is the fault of the camera and not a dramatic increase in my abilities.  The result has me convinced that I might want to actually crack open the book so I can fully utilize all of the available features.

I love to take pretty photos - but I cannot give an accurate professional review, as I'm merely a regular consumer who like cool gadgets :)It definitely takes a while to understand all of the features.  If you are used to the more commercial point and shoot digital cameras, you may want to read the instuction manual front to back before using the Ricoh.After using this camera for about 1.5 months, I've found that I may never use any of my other cameras again.  The incredible features of this camera include an amazing macro lens, an incredibly low aperture feature and a fixed lens.  The ability of this camera to take amazing photos in low light is one of the main reasons why I love this camera.  I hate the way bright flashes can ruin a great photo.  With this Ricoh, low light scenes are when this baby truly shines.  I went to the beach just a couple of weeks ago, and my sunrise and sunset photos are simply incredible.There is a pop up flash with the small lever on the side of the camera.  There is also a setting you can change (read the manual) to program certain buttons to be your digital zoom (the camera doesn't come set with the buttons programmed to be a digital zoom), which I find to be just OK, but you're not buying this camera for it's ZOOM capabilities.The accurate colors, the quick shutter speed and the ability to take phenomenal low light photos are just a few of the reasons to buy this camera if you are remotely considering it.

I fell in love with it even well before I left the country. About 4 or 5 months into my journey, after a night of really awesome photographs on a remote beach in New Zealand I discovered I'd gotten a fair amount of sand in the lens assembly and the camera was rendered useless much to my disappointment. The only repair options involved shipping the camera to Auckland or Sydney and it just was not practical since I was always moving about and didn't know where I'd be next so I simply held on to the broken camera, tucked away in my pack. About a month afterwards, spent trying to get by with just the K7 and wideshots (occasionally) with the crappy cam in my Blackberry, I broke down and purchased a Canon S90 at shop I wandered into thinking it could be even better. Now the S series are great cams and I used it for quite sometime, but I never stopped wishing the GRDIII was working and finally about a year later in Sydney, I took the Ricoh into a repair shop there and had it repair (new lens assembly) for about 400 or 500 australian (can't recall exactly how much) and was leary to do so. After receiving it back my joy was renewed and I in no way regretted spending the money, as funny as that may seem (at the time the GRD4 had not yet been released so the repair cost was still well below finding and purchasing a new GRDIII). About a week later I sold the S90 to someone in Sydney.I realize there are slightl differences in the S90/S95 and the GRDIII/GRDIV, but I've either used (obviously) or have friends with both and differences are negligible at best from a real-world use perspective.Bottom line, for my experience....

I do hobby photography and I've had this camera a month almost and I'm still learning the basics. I was up for the challenge though.

It is small and compact and easy to carry around but it has so many features that I just don't know what they all do.  I love taking pictures and I do some scrapbooking.  A good camera has become more important to me since having children and taking up the hobby.  I have discovered some cool things along the way by accident.  (You can change black and white photos to have different shades of black...some have a purple or a blue tint).  So I won't claim to understand everything this camera can do, but it makes a darn nice point and shoot too if you use the default settings.  My husband made the comment 'You'd have to try to take bad pictures with this camera!\".  We took pictures at all angles and in all light settings.  We took pictures while we were spinning in a circle or while the kids were skateboarding or riding their bikes past us.  Nearly all the action pictures came out in decent to excellent quality.  The only pictures I have been disappointed in have been those in poor light.  In the house with the flash on, the pictures come out nice unless the subject is extra dark.  We took a picture of our brown dog in the corner of the living room laying on the carpet.  The corner was pretty dark but the carpet is a medium beige.  Even with the flash those pictures came out a little blurry.  When the dog moved out of the corner into a little more light, the pictures were perfect although we still needed the flash.  Does anyone know a way to use this camera and get better pictures inside the house?  There very well could be features to help with this that are above my skill level.  We were disappointed that you can't zoom in further with this camera, yet in our everyday picture taking we haven't been displeased.  Also you have NEVER seen better pictures taken outside.  The quality is amazing.  Using my dog again for an example, you can see each line of his fur and all the different colors that make that fur stands out brilliantly.  The camera is basic and some other reviews have complained about that.  It IS basic, but its so compact and easy to go wherever you go.  That didn't bother us at all.

Frankly I was a bit surprised to see it as an option in my monthly review list as while I've purchased cameras from Amazon, never anything in this camera's price range or with as many available setting adjustments.  That being said, this review is written by a 'novice' photographer in the sense that I have never done anything like set an 'f-stop', but have used a zoom (digital/optical combo) and changed scenes (outdoor, night-scene, etc...) on other cameras.I currently own a Canon PowerShot SD1200IS 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Dark Gray), Canon PowerShot SX20IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch Articulating LCD and Flip UltraHD Video Camera - White, 8GB, 2 Hours.  I'm familiar with digital cameras and have used several photo editing software programs including Photoshop, Picture It, Picasa, Corel Paintshop Pro and others.The reason I give you this information is to let all you fantastic photographers out there know, I'm not in your league, but I like this camera!  I've played with it for a couple of days, reading the manual and being overwhelmed by the number of adjustments you can make to it, but feeling a bit confused by the lack of zoom. (4x digital zoom is on it, but as of yet, I'm still not sure how to make it work... so I'll keep re-reading the book.)The Pro's as I see it...1. Great body - made of metal, sturdy and with a texture to it that makes you feel like you have a good hold on the camera.  Lightweight, easy to slip into a large pocket, purse or your backpack.2. Large LCD screen.3. Excellent optics!  This camera's lens is where it shines.  Pictures are crystal clear, showing incredible detail when zoomed in using the enclosed software.4. Nice software package included with the camera.  Very fast editing and nice features.5. Flash is hidden in the camera body until it's needed and it pops up.  Makes the body of the camera look sleeker.6. Macro setting is very easy to use and produces incredible results!  (See my photo - one of my very first - of a flower with a bee in the middle of it, in the 'images' for this product.)7. Fast shutter speed, even on 'auto'.  Not the usual lag that other digital cameras have, and you can adjust it to be even speedier.8. Amazing array of adjustments for the intermediate to advanced photographer.9. A high-end, quality point and shoot which would be great for travel.10. Proprietary battery that allows for about 270 shots per charge, or you can use AAA batteries.11. Internal memory and SDHC card slot (card not included).12. 10MP is more than enough to get you incredible photos. 1cm macro... are you kidding me?!The Con's as they relate to my ability and budget...1. Expensive camera.2. No real 'zoom' function.3. Settings are overwhelming to the casual user and will take time to learn.4. No viewfinder - LCD is the only viewer.5. No case with it.6. Included directions are at times so basic it seems they are written for 6 year olds, and then they jump to very detailed information, but offer it in what seems like an incomplete way. Will be looking for articles online to help a bit more, with any luck!It's a great opportunity to test drive this camera for Amazon.  I see it being a camera that a photography student in high school or college would appreciate as a gift, or as a travel camera for an intermediate to advanced user.  I don't see it replacing the point-n' shoot models that Pentax, Canon and others are putting on the market for between $80 and $300, but then again, I don't think that was Ricoh's intention when they developed the GR Digital III.  The lens is incredible and the software is the icing on the cake.  If you purchase it, I'm sure you'll enjoy using this compact, yet powerful digital camera.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS... 24 hrs after review.ZOOM:I found the zoom!  In the 'menu' there is a plethora of settings. When you get the camera check out the menu and go into everything.  There is a setting that when changed makes a toggle button on the upper right hand side on the back of the camera, digitally zoom.  It can be changed to adjust white balance and a few other things too.  The bottom line: LOTS of settings and adjustments can be made, but it's nearly all done with the software in the camera that is adjusted through the menu.FIRMWARE:I also went to the Ricoh website to look up the camera.  I updated the firmware.  If you do this, you will have the latest features and the upgraded internal software, but read the directions for this installation first!  If you don't, you might screw it up to the point where you can't get it to work correctly at all.SETTING SAVES:If you want to tweak settings for specific types of photo taking, you can save your profiles in the camera. Up to SIX setting patterns that you can name so you can recognize them easily.RICOH WEBSITE:Check it out! Nice information about the functions of this camera for the novice/intermediate user can be found there. This is a professional-grade camera, but for those of us 'picture takers' versus photographers out there, it's helpful.ACCESSORIES via the WEBSITE: (taken from the Ricoh website):In addition to the 21 mm wide conversion lens (GW-2) and the hood and adapter (GH-2, '43 mm), there are soft cases (GC-3 and GC-4 [GV-2 external VF compatible]) and an exclusive new external flash (GF-1)* which can handle TTL flash using pre flash.Great diagrams of the camera and the accessories for it are on the site along with specifications, sample images and features.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "gorgeous pictures!", "Author": "Fitzgerald Fan", "ReviewID": "R3A3F0RCPCMNOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't lie; I am far from being a photographer and have always been a point and click sort of girl.

The maximum aperture for low light situations is F1.9.  It has a high sensitivity 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch CCD which helps to reduce image noise and improve photos in low light.It has a magnesium alloy body, weighing only 7.7 ounces. The dimensions are approximately 4.2\" x 2.4\" x 1.2\", which is about the same size as my Canon PowerShot A1100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Silver). It is small enough to be carried in the front pocket of your pants or shorts.It does not have an optical zoom but it does have a 4x digital zoom (digital zoom is inferior to optical zoom). I uploaded two customer images shot from the end of a football field, one without zoom and one with the 4x digital zoom. When you receive the camera the digital zoom may be turned off. The toggle button (with the magnifying glass icon) just below the Mode Dial controls the zoom, or this button can be set for White Balance (default) or Exposure Compensation. You have to go into the menu, choose the \"Key Custom Options\" menu on the left, and then scroll down to the \"Zoom Button\" option to activate the digital zoom option. Note that if you are saving pictures in Raw mode, the digital zoom cannot be used.This camera has a lot of features, options, and flexibility. The controls are well placed and easy to access. The Mode Dial gives you the following options: Auto, Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual, Scene (Dynamic Range, Skew Correction, Text Mode (for photos of text/drawings), and Movies with sound), plus 3 custom settings (MY1, MY2, and MY3) that you can save. (For Dynamic Range, 2 photos are taken at different exposures and then combined to create a composite image with the best contrast, reducing loss of detail in bright areas and shadows.) There is an \"Up Down Dial\" in front of the shutter release button and an \"Adj. Lever\" dial on the back side near the shutter release button. The Up-Down Dial and Adj. Lever dial can be used to select shutter speed and aperture in Program, Aperture, Shutter, and Manual modes. The Up-Down Dial can also be used to select options in the Program mode as well as other options. And the Adj Lever dial can be used for selecting even more options: Press the Adj Lever in (just like it was a button) and you can quickly and easily choose from 4 options that operate like drop down menus. By default the Adj Lever's four options are White Balance (Auto, Multi-P Auto (white balance in separate areas of the frame), Outdoors, Cloudy, Incandescent Lamp, Fluorescent Lamp, Manual Settings, and Detail (fine adjustments to white balance); Sensitivity (ISO settings of Auto, Auto-High, ISO 64, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1600); Saved Picture Quality (Adobe DNG RAW (10M), RAW 3:2 (9M), RAW1:1 (7M), Fine3648 (10M), Normal3648 (10M), Fine3:2 (9M), Normal3:2 (9M), Fine1:1 (7M), Normal1:1 (7M), etc.); and Image Setting (Vivid, Standard, Black & White, Black and White with toning effect, Setting 1, Setting 2 (custom settings to vividness, contrast, sharpness, colors, and hue). But if you prefer, you can change any of these four Adj Lever options to include white balance compensation, focus, metering, continuous shooting mode, bracketing mode (shoot 2 or 3 images varying the exposure, white balance, or color), flash compensation, manual flash amount, or exposure compensation. And there are a number of focus options: Autofocus, Multi AF (focusing on the closest subject), Spot AF (subject in the center), MF (manual focus), Snap (fixed distance), Infinity, and pre-AF options. The Fn buttons can be used to switch back and forth between autofocus, manual, or snap focus, or can be set to other functions. There are also options for changing the self-timer, metering, noise reduction, and more. Finally, Ricoh is adding new features and options by way of firmware updates to the camera's internal software.The macro mode is excellent and produces sharp images. Minimum shooting distance is less than 1/2 inch. So this would be a great camera for someone needing pictures of jewelry or small items to sell on online auction sites.I've found that using a digital camera's movie functions can be good for those occasions when you don't have a movie camera with you. The camera captures video and sound in 640x480 or 320x240 resolution and 30 frames per second or 15 fps.The pop-up flash can be set at 12 levels from 1/64 to full flash. There are also flash synchro and flash exposure compensation options. There's also a hot shoe for adding a flash.The camera has a three inch, high definition 920k LCD screen display. More than 30 indicators or icons may be shown on the screen. Two nice features are the histogram and the electronic level indicator. There is not a viewfinder, but Ricoh sells an external viewfinder as an accessory. In the hot August sun in Texas, I was still able to see the LCD screen in bright sunlight. In the playback mode there are many options available for working with the pictures in memory. Up to 81 images can be displayed on the screen at one time which aids in searching for photos in memory.The camera has 88 MB of internal memory which will hold about 100 images in 2,048 x 1,536 format. So you'll need to purchase an SD or SDHC memory card, up to 32 GB. (No memory card is included.)The camera comes with a DB-65 rechargeable Li-ion battery, or the camera will take a DB-60 rechargeable battery. The camera can also be operated with a pair of AAA alkaline or rechargeable NiMH batteries. Depending on your shooting practices, you could get over 350 shots with the DB-65 battery, or around 25 shots with 2 AAA alkaline batteries. If you're reading the user's manual and can't determine the proper orientation for inserting the battery, see the customer image that I uploaded.The enclosed CD includes the DL-10 Windows software for copying pictures to a computer, plus the Irodio Photo & Video Studio. I'm not sure if this software works with Windows 7 64-bit, but I didn't have any problem transferring pictures from the camera without the software using Windows 7 64-bit. The camera can be used with Mac OS 9.0-9.2.2 and Mac OS X versions 10.1.2-10.5.6, but the software on the CD is not Mac compatible.If the camera had an optical zoom and possibly HD video, then I think this camera would be nearly perfect.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Straightforward and Capable", "Author": "Kevin L.

But for a device with so many features, the learning curve is remarkably straightforward, and I haven't savvied everything yet only because this camera has so many advanced capabilities.  The enormous digital camera I used during my brief journalism career had fewer, weaker capabilities than this one.Family photo buffs will like the clear image on the (relatively) large viewfinder screen.  You can immediately tell how desirable and clear your photo will appear when you take it to the printer or post it to the web.  This will save a great deal of frustration in the long haul.  The video capacity is pretty rudimentary, not recommended for movie prodigies, but for casual snaps, this camera gives you more than you will likely need.The print manual that comes enclosed with the camera is rubbish.  First of all it's tiny, and the type pushes the limits of legibility.  Then the writing takes place in abrupt, telegraphic sentences.  Thankfully, the CD-ROM manual is much more useful and legible.  Even better, this camera is so simple to use that you might be astonished at how quickly you'll pick up the important points by plain old trial and error.As a word of warning, don't try to load your photos to your computer until you install the enclosed software.  I took a photo roster of my students, then hastily connected the camera to my office computer, and my photos disappeared into the cosmos.  The enclosed software is both quick to install and simple to use, so perhaps installation should be your first priority, before you start taking test snaps.All in all, I find this camera enjoyable for casual photography, and straightforwardly useful for more formal applications.  I would probably look at more sophisticated models if I wanted a career as a portraitist or artist, but for most purposes, this camera goes beyond what even pricy high-end technology could do only a couple of years ago.

BLANCHARD \"Desert Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1UEHQ43EBQIF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "RICOH GR DIGITAL III CAMERAThis is a very, very good, high performance 10 MP digital camera with a surprising number of professional features for its diminutive size and weight. It also has a couple of unfortunate shortcomings. The most important lack is an optical zoom (there is only a 4X digital zoom). There is also no image stabilization. However, if you can live without these two features, which are present in almost all point-and-shoots being sold today, read on.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICSThis is one of the few small cameras that has a built-in hot shoe for accessories such as an external flash unit or an external  viewfinder. It has a superb fixed 6.0mm lens (equivalent to a 28mm lens on a 35mm camera) that opens to a nice, wide f1.9 aperture. Because of this, the lens is outstanding in low light situations. Focus range is from 30CM to infinity and in the Macro setting, it will focus down to 1CM - one-quarter inch. Autofocus is very fast with almost no lag time. The camera is very compact and lightweight - 7.5 oz. (only 2 oz. more that my mobile phone!) The reason for this is the well-built magnesium body - very sturdy feeling with a secure, wide rubberized gripping surface. It has an incredibly sharp 3 inch LCD screen that can be adjusted for brightness.OPERATION AND EXPOSUREThere are several modes - Aperture priority, Shutter priority, a Program Shift mode that ranges properly exposed settings combining various apertures and shutter speeds. In addition there are six \"MY\" settings where custom configurations to match various shooting conditions can be set up and saved. There is also a completely manual setting for times when no auto program will do. The versatility of available settings is very impressive - exposure compensation, flash synchro settings, noise reduction, ISO settings, level adjustment/correction, white balance compensation and several more. In addition, there are two function buttons that can be set to control any of the above adjustments that the operator uses most. There are four `scene' settings - HDR combines two exposures to optimize high contrast scenes. In this case, the HDR combination is saved as well as the normal exposure. There is a Skew Correction feature where the camera attempts to reduce perspective distortion with varying success. There is a Text setting that makes high contrast exposures for capturing printed text, whiteboard charts and written notes. The camera takes VGA size movies as well, not HD. The camera will take bracketed exposures in 1/3 or \u00bd stop increments. The exposures can be set to all color (Auto-bracketing), White Balance bracketing and Color bracketing, a black and white and a color exposure for each shutter press. There is an interval timer so with a tripod, an exposure every minute or a user-selectable time interval is possible. When a photo is being set up, there is a Tilt Sensor that displays on the LED screen assuring that the camera is level, with or without an audible cue. The camera saves RAW image data which is rare in small cameras.FOCUSFocus features built into this camera are many and varied. The auto-focus is lightning quick and in cases when even this is too slow, Ricoh utilizes their convenient Snap feature. Set the focal distance and when the shutter is pressed all the way down in one motion, the camera uses that focal length, if it is pressed halfway down first, the normal auto-focus process is used. This is excellent for shooting, say, a sports event where the focus can be preset on the players so there is no delay waiting for auto-focusing. In addition, there is a Pre-AF feature. When this is active, the camera continuously focuses as the camera is moved into position for a shot - ready to shoot at the press of the shutter. This camera also can be set to show a depth of field guideline or a nice levels graph for each aperture on its LED screen.BOTTOM LINEThe Ricoh GR Digital III is a joy to use and with its truly professional features, it is uniquely positioned - small, compact and exceptionally powerful. Without an optical zoom and image stabilization, it is not really a family point-and-shoot and as such, it seems a little overpriced. However, for the serious photographer who wants a feature-rich but pocketable camera, this may just be the one that fills the bill.

Lots of reading required for the novice.* It's bare on function buttons.This camera takes amazing photos as long as the person taking them has the knowledge to use this camera properly.

Because it's a fixed-lens cam, I don't have to worry about obtaining multiple lenses for different situations. Of course, it's not going to be able to do what a multi-lens cam can, but the tradeoff is that it's highly portable, while retaining a high level of functionality for those who take the time to learn its nuances and operational details.Obviously, the primary market for this camera is the pro photographer who sometimes needs to switch to a small form-factor, point-and-shoot for appropriate situations. To that end, its price point is likely higher than most casual picture-takers are going to want to spend. However, for the dabbler- someone who wants to experience some of the considerations pros do, without making a major investment of time and money- this is a great option. The photo quality is excellent, as others have demonstrated, and in terms of the complexity-vs.-accessibility of its features, you can go as deep as you wish. Once you grasp the basics of its operation, you have a superior-performing camera that retains the point-and-shoot appeal of consumer cameras.Recommended for those who are looking for an introduction to pro photography, but who want an easy-to-use camera that takes great pictures while they learn.

Let me first start by admitting I am a philistine in the world of high level photography and I will approach this review from the novices point of view.  Hopefully this will be helpful to some readers who are wanting real quality but are not sure about this camera.  To those of you who know your stuff, most of this will be pretty redundant.I had been using a real el cheapo 3rd generation digital camera , so going to the Ricoh Digital III was like the difference between walking and warp speed.  I wondered to myself if maybe this camera was a bit beyond me and how hard would it be to figure out the functions I needed.I unpacked the camera and accessories, put the batteries in the included charging cradle and within 3 hours I was ready to try things out.  I was first struck by how lightweight the Digital III is and how just plain GOOD it felt in my hand.  All the controls are solid feeling and easily seen and labeled clearly.  It is very apparent the build quality is excellent and nothing was skimped on.  In a word, this camera is elegant. At first I was overwhelmed by the many options you can choose regarding set up and image quality , but I soon realized how easily I could customize my own presets for most any sort of picture I wanted to take.  I first acquainted myself with all the different menus and screens and how they related to each function.  If I didn't understand a function or term , I consulted the manual which is LARGE by any standard and printed 100% in English.  (also included is a PDF manual on disc)  It is VERY advisable to learn as many functions and settings as  possible BEFORE attempting to take any pictures that are important to you.  All told, I spent about 90 minutes playing with the screens and referring to both the manual and some quick Google info.  I found you can actually use more than one control for the same function and set the camera up to access these functions in a way that suits YOU.  Nice!I soon realized the Digital III would be much easier to operate than I initially thought.I then went about setting up a special preset for indoor closeup portraits , outdoor landscapes , and even black and white which is a favorite for me.  You can easily set your Ricoh to any number of image quality settings and all the way up to \"Raw\" which is uncompressed and offers staggering image quality, albeit while using staggering amounts of memory.  I found a middle of the road image quality setting that worked for me and still left me with enough onboard memory to make 100 images before needing to save to my computer.  Even with this setting the quality of image far surpassed anything I had ever seen before from any other cameras I have used.This is a fixed lens camera and as such does not offer a zoom lens, however there IS a digital zoom function and if you don't overuse it , this will not seriously degrade image quality for normal real world applications.  While not a true zoom, it IS handy and I was glad to see it included.The display is large by my standards and more than adequate.  Besides the image you are looking at, it will also let you know when you are in focus, when the light is right for your settings and how many images you have left in the onboard memory or on an optional memory card.Actually the list of items the display will show you is too numerous to list here, but suffice it to say you won't be wondering what's going on with your camera once you know what to look for and how to read the displays.  The system software is truly excellent and easy to use and understand after giving yourself some time with this camera.  Downloading to my computer was a snap and I was literally blown away by the image quality when seen on my monitor and after printing a few test shots on glossy paper.Also, I should mention you can make avi files as well with sound. Nothing too fancy, but it works and there are some nice options for format and image quality for this as well.The physical controls feel VERY responsive, the shutter itself is very lush and highly responsive.  I was amused that the camera makes a shutter sound thru it's small onboard speaker.  Using this camera is a real joy and my results make me look much better than I am as far as being a photographer goes.The Ricoh Digital III is a very high grade professional tool for both the amateur and working photographer alike, but it also can yield very satisfying results for photographic philistines such as myself.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good Point & Shoot Camera, pricey though.", "Author": "Doffod \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R1VY29W17TXP24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a high-end point-and-shoot camera.

What I did see when I opened the package was a nice looking camera with numerous controls and an (unwritten) invitation that said, \"Try me!\". Well, the nearest I ever came to a camera of this sort was nearly 60 years ago when a friend sold me his Kodak Retina 35mm camera... I had been using a 35mm \"snapshot\" camera and the Retina opened a whole new world for me. I've been using a snapshot-type digital camera for several years and had a lot of fun with it. Only paid $20 for it on sale, too. I like to take pictures of birds, animals, plants, and such. My digital camera doesn't have a zoom feature. The Ricoh doesn't either... and neither did my Retina, yet I could take some very nice and impressive closeups with it. One thing that has always fascinated me is the macro feature. I remember two friends that had macros back around 1980 and they were able to do amazing shots of my model railroad... very impressive. Is this Ricoh going to be the start of a new hobby for this 76 year old senior? I'd bet it is! I like all the controls... puts me in charge!

My wife loves the feature on our SLR that allows for near continuous shooting, something that the Sureshot can't do.  The Ricoh isn't quite as fast as our SLR, but it's pretty close.What I think the Sureshot does better is in its design of controls.  Getting the Ricoh to zoom requires fiddling with the controls to designate one of the switches as the zoom lever.  It's in the instructions but takes a little bit of figuring out.

Well, this little camera has a ton of features, and offers many of the same manual options that SLR cameras offer:  shutter, aperture and ISO sensitivity control, etc.  The image quality is excellent, though a bit of a caveat: if you are an amateur like me, don't expect a miraculous camera that makes your shots (or you) look better than they are.  This is a camera that rewards basic and advanced knowledge of photography: lighting, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc (hence the above features).  This camera is terrific for landscape shots and \"macro\" photography, and has terrific light-sensitivity versatility (especially low-light, high ISO situations).

It's a great toy to play around with, but you really wouldn't want to take your really important photos with it. Ricoh has built this camera into a solid body with a slim profile and I applaud the inclusion of a rechargeable battery (you don't see this in a lot of point and shoot cameras). The LCD screen provides crisp views of your just taken photos and the lock on the mode wheel ensures that you'll stick to your last mode as your whipping this camera out of your pocket. The camera has a built in flash and a hot foot as well. Your picture taking capacity is only limited to the size of your SD card.Still, the distortions caused by the lens are a huge draw back and I can't bring myself to giving this camera more than three starts. That plus being locked in to a true point and shoot realm (with only a 28mm capability) really drives the negatives home.***update***it was requested that I provide proof of my last paragraph. Please see the customer images section of this page (you can see some of this discussion in the comments section of this review as well).I think I left the last paragraph a little lacking, so I'll provide more information here. When the camera was used at less than 10 feet away, some of the edges were distorted in that there was an elongation of the photo on that edge (my picture of me cutting my wife's birthday cake demonstrates this - she was standing 2 or 3 feet from me). My guess is that the average user will utilize this camera in such settings (an not just panoramic or scenic shots) and that he or she should be aware of this. I have other shots that show this, but they are of my wife and I don't know how comfortable she is with me posting the pics here - I'll check and edit (maybe blur her face or something) and see if I can't post them here.In addition, I provided a picture of my bike in my basement to exemplify taking pictures in low light situations. The bike is sitting directly under two fluorescent lights, but it comes out a little blurry. I could have mounted the camera on my tripod to take the picture, but if you're an average user, you probably won't be doing that (or if you do, the people you're taking a picture of are going to hate you for it... trust me, I know) so I didn't do that either.Bottom line: For long distance or scenic shots, this camera is great (see my picture of the city - I'm not saying that my shot is great, but the crispness of the colors, the contrast and the resolution make for a satisfying shot).

Just to make sure I was not being deceived by the LCD, I had about 35-40 pictures developed at the local Wal-Mart and even though the quality of the one hr processing was substandard the pictures turned out good. Imagine how much better they'll be if processed with higher standards. I love my Ricoh GR digital III.(edit) 2011 I have since gone back to my original 4 starts rating. The picture quality is just goo good, for such a small camera and the shutter speed is fast. Wish I could take better pictures with the manual settings. I just have to work with it a little more to get it. I now take this everywhere.(edit) 2010 I now have knocked it down to 3 stars. Wish I could give a 3.5 rating because I would. I think depending on what you need you could be happy or disappointed. It will not replace your DSLR.  I compared the pictures from my SRL again to this camera and I may have jumped the gun a little bit. The SRL is much better most of the time. I was looking at the camera screen and uploaded them to Apple TV and it's a noticeable difference now; the SRL is better.

I have been exploring all the features and capabilities and I have to say that I am so pleased with it.  It takes a great picture, it is easy to use, and the instruction guide was simple to follow along with as well.  I don't always catch on quickly with electronics, but this wasn't hard for me at all.  I especially LOVE the size.  I have a great camera, but it's far too large for me to carry around in my purse, but this is PERFECT to have with me all the time.  I thought, given the size, that it may not have as many features as my larger camera, but I have to say, it does everything but take the photo for you!  I love that it takes movies, and the movies can be up to 90 minutes long, or so the booklet says!  I know I am going to have this with me always, as one never knows when that perfect picture may turn up!", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the most user friendly camera but awesome picture quality", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1W7PFNGTL2HPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera takes great pictures. The image quality surpasses point and shoots on the market and rivals DSLR's.  The camera body has an old style feel and look, and not surprisingly the interface feels the same.  There are many customization options that can at times be daunting to get a handle on. Coupled with a lack of some consumer friendly features this camera is clearly aimed at a niche.  Because it is targeted for a different audience than casual use point and shoots, its hard to detract too much from the rating for being less user-friendly.  If the software was a little more advanced and image stabilization worked better it would be five stars. Overall though, the image quality for this size can't be beat.Edit: I made a misstatement about image stabilization. There isn't any, and I had meant to say if image stabilization was present.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "such a nice lense on less than an APS-C sensor?", "Author": "niels", "ReviewID": "R3UU12RQ74MMRS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ok so its ~$100 cheaper than several APS-C or micro four-third sensor equipped competitors that have exchangeable lenses.I would have happily paid $100 more to have an APS-C camera with an excellent fixed lens from Ricoh, where a small sensor doesn't diminish the usefulness of the expense of its lens. Of course, they probably started designing this lense a while ago, and at the time, the choice of an APS-C sensor might not have been available to the designers.  Since you can't really design a lense in a vacuum, they would have had to start the design all over to match it to a different size sensor...A combo of a lens like this with large sensor would have afforded a camera that could handily beat the Nex-5 or GF2 on size, when those bulky exchangeable lenses are taken into account.And the need for different lenses diminishes if you have one that is truly excellent.This Camera's build quality is very good.  I'm not much into retro style / retro surface coverings, but I can't argue about the quality.Here's hoping that Ricoh will keep their much appreciated lens philosophy and produce a follow-on with a larger sensor and fixed lense.Such a camera would be unique at this time as far as I know, as all the other Manufacturers are selling theirs with exchangeable kit lenses that aren't really that great, which of course is meant to get you to buy more lenses from them in the future. This I wouldn't mind so much, if those lenses weren't so bulky that you can still forget any thought of shirt-pocket storage...Ricoh?  what do you think?  can you do it by xmas 2012?", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I want to like it, but lacking some features", "Author": "H. Sapiens \"Amanda\"", "ReviewID": "R319SSONEGNE7Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful camera - let me just say that to start, but certain must-have (for me) features are lacking that makes this a poor overall buy in my humble and widely ignored opinion.Pros:The flash - this camera sold me on the flash, it is very adjustable and manual without getting those awful blurry shots that are typical with low light settingsMacro - I like to take pictures of bugs. I'm a biologist. It's very nice compared to other cameras I've tried even using dedicated macro lensesThe body of the camera is incredibly solid - it feels very well made - I'm impressed.Cons:Umm.. no image stabilization. Problem for shots in high activity settingsNo optical zoom - I've gotten used to its presence, and this limits the camera in my opinionI also felt like my outdoor landscape pictures were a little flat compared to my SLR.Some of the controls were less than intuitive and adjustments subtle.I also found some of the buttons a bit too small.Bottom line: I think this camera is good for certain situations, but is definitely not a one-size-fits-all kind of camera. (So, it should not be your go-to-camera). If you are going to take a ton of low-light or macro pictures where no zoom is required - this may fit the bill.
