{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon Quality In a Small Package", "Author": "Mitchell Small", "ReviewID": "RQNPL3Q7HEYLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a dedicated Nikon 35mm fan for years, but this is my first Nikon digital camera. I did debate very long between the SLR series and the Coolpix line, but in the end, the compact design and the lighter weight of the Coolpix nudged me in that direction. So far, I am not disappointed.The menu structure is different from the Olympus menu system I had become used to, but a short session with the Nikon owner's manual quickly showed me how to access all the functions. Perhaps it is because I had used another band of digital camera for the last few years, I did not originally find the Nikon menu quite as intuitive. I had no trouble changing over however, after less than an hour or so.The Coolpix is clearly designed as a point and shoot digital camera. Personally, I favor more of a wide angle style than what this camera delivers, but the zoom range is quite nice and very useable. Automatic modes are the default for everything. In my initial testing, I found very few photos that were not acceptable using the fully auto everything. Excellent optics and a vibration compensation system yielded very crisp hand held images. Good marks for this area.While there is no full manual operation for the S630, there are shooting modes galore that will provide settings to isolate the subject from the background using larger apertures (portrait modes) or favor smaller apertures for greater depth of field when photographing scenic views. There is even an extreme close up mode, similar to the macro mode of many 35mm cameras. Other overrides will allow you to modify the flash effects (fill in, red eye reduction, off and others), fire bursts of shots (depending on exposure up to several per second), set automatic intervals (pre-determined) or even some in camera creative effects. While it did take some getting used to the controls, the S630 again took high marks in this area.One of the features I really like about the Coolpix S series in general is the large, compared to my older digital camera, viewing screen. I was even more pleased to find I could superimpose a small grid as an aid in composition. I was trained on a 4x5 view camera and had a grid screen for my old Nikon F2S, so this was like coming home for me. I would have liked some intermediate lines in addition to the three by three box pattern, but even this simple implementation will prove useful.The S630 uses an exclusive rechargeable battery. I suggest buying at least one spare battery with your camera. While the battery is rated at well over 200 exposures before needing to be recharged, I'm sure Mr. Murphy will be at the party you are photographing and your battery will die, just as you are about to snap that great celebrity photo you dreamed about taking. The S630 makes the external charger as part of your purchase package and an AC cord is an option. If you like being able to run on standard batteries, this may be less than desirable for you, but I like the rechargeable feature from an environmental standpoint. Call this an even trade.I was disappointed in the lack of an uncompressed format to save images in. My last digital camera had a RAW format that while not used for every photograph nonetheless was used often enough I miss not having it. You do have some selection in the JPEG compression, however, so I have to be content with that. Your photos do look their best using the maximum pixel count, so you will want a high capacity card. I urge you to get at least a 4 GB card to supplement the minimal onboard memory.Now we come to my only real dissatisfaction with the S630, and that has little to do with the camera itself. I hate the software suite Nikon supplies. I must digress a moment here. If you use a high capacity SD card, one that is 4 GB or more, you may not be able to read the card with the card reader built into your computer. While technically still an SD card, the SDHC series cards use some internal difference to break the 2 GB barrier. Whatever the reason, you should purchase an external reader capable of handling the SDHC format cards.Without an external card reader, you need to plug the camera into your computer and use the Nikon Transfer software to transfer the images to your computer. While the plug fitting on the camera looks like a mini-USB, I could not get a mini-USB cable I already owned to fit the socket. I needed to use the Nikon supplied cable. My computer would not recognize the camera until I loaded the software. The transfer process is slow and the interface is clunky at best. I also have my own photo retouching software and do not need the software Nikon supplies. With an external card reader, the process is greatly simplified: remove the SD card, pop it in the reader and transfer the images just like any other file collection. An external reader will also provide a faster transfer speed.All together, I found the S630 a very nice travel package. This camera will deliver some very high quality images without the bulk of an SLR. You can easily fit a spare battery, spare memory cards and the camera into a small case not even the size of a case for sunglasses. Well worth the price until you really need the versatility of a digital SLR.6/30/2009Recently returned from 10 day trip to Japan. The camera performed flawlessly and delivered photos even better than I expected. Great available light shots, very good flash fill in, good video in karaoke bar and wonderful overall grab shots. My only complaint is I wish it had a wider wide angle, but I knew this going into the trip. Used the telephoto at maximum to capture details at the top of castles, shrines and temples; great results there made up for the lack of a wider view.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Tested for 3 weeks in Europe ...", "Author": "Integrity Trainer", "ReviewID": "R1P5I2HUJ8GYOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Nikon Coolpix S630 just before I went to Europe five weeks ago. After 1000 pictures of mountain tops, people, dark museums and action shots, I am done testing it and am very pleased. For years I wanted a hassle-free camera with a high amount of optical zoom yet small in size and shoots well without a lot of light. I hoped to spend less money but was afraid a cheaper camera would frustrate me due to lack of features, poor quality or confusing operation. The S630 gives me all I want in a camera for a reasonable price.My cousin was a professional photographer and he is impressed with how well this camera performs. Closeups of flowers are great. Pictures displayed on a 42\" TV have great resolution and color accuracy. Photos of poorly lit rooms have bright colors. Video and audio quality also are impressive.Reading reviews critical of this camera made me a little nervous about deciding to buy this camera but I am glad that I figured out they are overly critical except for the zoom speed. The zoom motor is too fast and you often overshoot where you want it to stop. All too often it will not stop where you want it to and you have to step forward or backward to frame the shot. No camera will always produce a perfect shot on the automatic setting. Photography is a learned skill. The large screen lets you see if the shot did not come out right. You learn and try one of the other settings available. Battery life was roughly 125? pics. Time between pics is a little slow, but OK.PROS: Quality pictures, video and audio; 7x optical zoom in a small body; logical hassle-free operation; reasonable price; low light pics are outstanding; has many other nice features.CONS: 1) Zoom speed as described above. 2) The Nikon S630 does not use common batteries, so you need to pay for a special spare battery that you need to keep charged at all times. 3) The software included has no editing capability just viewing and transferring. 4) The optional Leather Case (Nikon #5811) is too small to carry a spare battery or extra memory card. I bought a case at Wal-Mart that works perfectly. It was a little tight at first, but it stretched out after a couple days.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT!", "Author": "K.

The pictures are extremely clear when downloaded to my computer. The setting menus are simple to use. The cameras round edge where you place you picture thumb is a nice ergonomic feature. The two areas of concern are: 1.) The cover for the USB port cable seems very flimsy and could easily break from the cord attaching it to the camera. I have not had any problems with this, but is seems very cheap. 2.) The Camera LCD appears grainy when focusing on an image.

Huston", "ReviewID": "RSAJ1XST5L668", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i don't buy many cameras. here's my 20-year photo history: this nikon replaces a panasonic lumix FS5, which met an untimely end two weeks ago. that camera replaced an older digital sony point-and-shoot, and that in turn replaced a very basic-model canon 35mm SLR (which i very likely never used to its full potential).i've now owned the nikon for 3 whole days, and it has provided the most fun i've had with a camera since i had my old 35mm, but without the hassle of film development (and the accompanying crapshoot of \"how will the pics turn out?\").  i've drained three batteries so far and taken i can't remember how many hundreds of sample pics without any real problems to report.i'm not a HUGE camera nerd or photography snob, but i like to think i can take a decent picture now and then. i'm probably close to the definition of \"casual photographer.\"  here, then, are my impressions of the nikon S630, beginning right out of the box:the design is great. i'm an above-average-sized guy, with pretty big hands, yet the controls are easily placed and i have yet to mash the wrong button (or combo of them) with any of my giant thumbs. my girlfriend uses a small kodak digital, and the shutter and power buttons are so close on that camera that i turn the thing off as often as i snap a successful pic.  not so with my new nikon, i'm happy to report, yet the case is small enough and the controls placed so that a person with normal-sized hands should find it just as easy and comfortable as i do.battery and memory card are both a standard design, no brand-specific special purchases required.  hooray for that!the controls are well placed (the dial, or at least the ribs on it could be a tiny bit larger for my own ease of use, but that's not a real problem), and their use as well as the menu options they lead to are reassuringly and happily clear and easy to follow (definitely unlike my experience with my last panasonic). i find that i actually LIKE tinkering with the settings while using this camera!  i'm also one of those annoying people who don't like to read the manuals that come with their gadgets, and have been able to figure out pretty much everything i've wanted to without having to crack a page. that says something positive about the camera, right?shutter speed is GREAT. the autofocus is very fast, with only minimal hesitation or fluctuation - even when the zoom is fully extended (the sony and panasonic both took AGES to focus themselves). the zoom itself is great: at 7x, closeups are REALLY close, and the clarity of menu options has so far meant that the closeups i've taken are nice and clear, not grainy or blurred half the time like with previous cameras. the burst feature is much better engineered than on my panasonic (the slight loss of image quality when using this feature is acceptable - ya gotta make the occasional sacrifice for speed).  i haven't done much with the movie or voice options, just a little sampling with each, but they seem fine as well.image quality has been great so far. my panasonic may have had a slight edge here (which may just be the result of having used it longer and been more familiar with it), but the pixellation and off-color problems i've read about in other reviews have not occurred thus far.  low-light shots have turned out just fine, too (another problem i've read about others having).i can't say much for the durability or longevity of this unit, or for nikon's customer service, as i've only had it a very short time.  fingers crossed that i don't have to amend this review on either of those scores.this camera seems to have received more mixed reviews than any other i checked out before buying. i'm not sure where the problems these other folks are having are coming from. it's a pocket camera, really, and meant for the casual photographer as opposed to the professional - do they expect it to make their morning coffee too?  for my purposes (family, pets, vacation & nature shots, car shows, the occasional sports event, still lifes of stuff to sell on the 'net), and for those of people with similar needs, it ought to work just fine.i may not know enough about them to be a full-fledged camera snob, but i am fairly picky about my gadgets and toys.  so far, the nikon S630 has been a joy to work with.  unless it explodes or catches fire while i'm using it the day after the warranty expires, i'm sold!", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera!", "Author": "Everyone Knows It's Windy \"Windy\"", "ReviewID": "R38CQ7PCQPLBG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now had this camera for several months and it is a great camera.

We were trying to take pics of various objects in the house from max optical zoom and it had a hard time focusing on it.  This was also at night.

No pocket camera in the world should have a problem in these conditions, but the Nikon S630 couldn't do it.  If a posed group shot in bright sunlight was too much for this camera, I can't imagine what a nighttime shot would be like.

The problem with reviews like these is that we all have different opinions on what we see as good or bad in a photo. I'm pretty picky when it comes to judging the digital quality of a photo.

It was the 7x zoom that convinced me to buy it.I tested all the settings from automatic to manual.I'll get to the point with my main complaint - image quality was a big disappointment.- way too much noise in varying lighting conditions- It showed bright blue pixels in many of the photos. Even when taking portrait shots of my wife in decent lighting conditions, she ended up with hot blue pixels in about 5 or 6 areas of her face. Plants and other subjects showed the same results.- Zooming more than about 3x or 4x yields nothing but blurry pictures unless you use a tripod and the self-timer. So, don't expect to get nice sharp images when using the advertised 7x zoom.

There is no fine zoom speed, its allllllllllllllways fast.  If you attempt to frame something the zoom over shoots the desired focal length. then you go back and forth with the zoom, too tight, too loose, too tight, too loose. ARRRRG  I crop it later.Controls were frustrating.  Change the exposure?  Don't forget to confirm before you shoot or it reverts back to the previous setting.  Don't even THINK of shooting in low light.  Although the camera is 3200ISO (In 3M only) they FORGOT THE NOISE REDUCTION.  So any shot not in sunlight has multi colored sparkles.  Now a few extra sparkles in a night sky isn't so bad but the sparkles in the grass look dumb.  And remember your sparkles in the sky might be green or purple.  Rather than using a recursive noise reduction (Cameras that used this shoot your picture and then shoot one more with the lens closed, then subtract the second picture (which is noise only) from the first giving a near perfect sharp picture)  The only option here was to have the camera BLUR the picture so the noise would be blended away.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R3OE6DKSLV5Q0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking at most of the cameras that fit the needs of my wife, I chose the Nikon - S630  COOLPIX.  I read dozens of reviews - some good and some not so good. I think that the poor reviews were mostly from people who had too high expectation of this little NIKON.  Well here is mind review. The camera is small and the controls are well thought out.The camera fits easily  in a pocket or purse.  One of the best features is the 7X zoom lens, that works great. I took a picture of a wall and window to a restaurant in the City Centre, Las Wages and then zoomed in thru the window to see a chef making Japanese Sushi,  awesome pics.  The camera is fast and the quality of the pictures is almost as good as my expensive DSLR. The only thing is does not take pictures while swinging the camera around, but who does that?  The camera worked well in dark situations on AUTO. and also with the flash turned off. I shot sunsets and scenes in the desert with good quality. Inside shots were better than I thought they would be. The old camera was a Canon and it took great pics too, but the S630 Coolpic was even better to my surprise.  Another great feature is the lens is out in a second or less ready to shoot, so you don't miss a shot. We got about 200 shots per charge on the rechargeable battery and used a 4 GB memory chip which gave over 1250 pictures at the highest quality. I have yet to use the movie feature and some of the other manual features. The camera can even tell when a person smiles or blinks - amazing.  If you are looking for a compact camera and very good quality, this Coolpic S630 fit the bill for me.  Now my wife want her Christmas present back, so she can shoot some pics and she did and her pictures came out great too. She liked the Zoom right by the release button. the 2.7 inch view is plenty big too! Happy hunting for a camera at $200 with a case and memory chip  too. :)", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot, Minor Inconveniences", "Author": "MW", "ReviewID": "R149A41E8DX2IG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera actually feels pretty solid in my hands, you can tell it's plastic but it doesn't feel cheap overall. The pictures I took came out great, everything was clear even on most of the 7x zoom shots (more zoom = you need to move less). I am very happy with the quality of the lens and the layout. Nikon really gave it some extras such as using a zoom ring and a comfortable thumb rest while shooting (portrait and landscape modes). I am pleased with the shooting response time (from powering on to taking a picture) and have not experienced any shutter lag (I know that it IS slower than others, but really if you're getting a small point and shoot you have to give up something when the camera is $225.) I did play around with some of the features such as messing with the AUTO settings and the automatic smile mode. I didn't find the auto smile mode (it shoots when it senses a smile) to be that worthwhile. There are a lot of scene modes which can be overwhelming, but the auto scene selector works great! I have not done enough testing to see how the color really turns out under different settings.I gave this 4 stars and not a full 5 for a few reasons that are more personal annoyances than performance issues. The first is that the little dial on the back feels cheap. I would have rather this been metal. It doesn't affect performance, but it does take away from the experience when you feel it. The second problem is that the menu is terrible. Nikon needs to put some R&D; into making a menu that is very intuitive and user friendly. A nice GUI would really go a long way - this looks like a theme from DOS when you perform certain actions (such as format the card). Another thing is while looking at the thumbnails it is a pain to zoom back out. There is no quick way to get back to the picture in original size. Instead you have to zoom out .2x each time. Yow can hold it down, but then it goes to the view where you can see multiple thumbnails on the screen. A .5 or 1 second delay would help this out. The smallest complaint is that the charger does not have a flip out plug, you have to take the charging unit AND the (long) cord with you when you travel.All in all these are tiny complaints for such a great camera. I recommend getting a case and screen protector for it and of course a large SDHC card and extra battery (from experience). Really this is a great camera for a little over $220 (at the time of this review). As with anything make sure you do research and try to get a hands on demo before buying it.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Frustrated by photo quality", "Author": "Busy NY Mom", "ReviewID": "R2VXRW9AROV2UJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Although in theory this camera comes with some great features, I am very disappointed. I had a Coolpix 4800 for several years, and despite the fact that it boasted only 4 MP, i feel that the photos were far superior to the ones i am getting out of the s630. I was excited to find another nikon with a lot of zoom, and expected the same quality as what i had previously. Unfortunatly, i was dissapointed.Outdoors the colors are great and crisp, but i have yet to shoot an indoor shot that makes me really happy. as a mom taking pics of her kids all the time, this is frustrating beyond words. the colors take on an unnatural reddish orangey hue, and i constantly get blurring, even with image stabilization. I have tried Auto mode and scene selecter and every type of scene possible, but no matter what i do, the color quality is just off and fuzziness common. After several months i finally figured out that the best way to get my kids and not worry about them moving and therefore blurring or getting that ghostly motions quality, as they invariably do, is to use sports mode, but then the camera drops to 3MP. As a result the photos are not really crisp, which when buying a camera with as many MP as this one has regularly, it's once again, frustrating. On the plus side, I have the red one, which is really fun looking, and i love the size and the zoom is pretty close to my old 4800 (which drowned last summer :-( and is no longer working). Also, it's really comfortable in a hand of my size and has a nice thumbgrip intentation.**Update: After writing this review i realized how truly annoyed i am about my photos, so i actually contacted Nikon through their website and attached two of my photos as examples of their poor quality.  They actually told me what to change in my setting to hopefully fix the problem.  I shot a few pictures which actually seem much better, but it's too soon to tell.  I will be taking lots of pictures in the days to come and if i see a difference, i will come back, change the rating and let you know how to adjust the menu for better pics!*****update 12/29/10 while nikon was very helpful in terms of customer service, the photos are still not as good as they should be.

I've now taken about 1000 pictures and a dozen movie clips in a variety of conditions.  The optical vibration reduction works great, I've taken lots pictures while skiing and at Disney parks on rides and they come out great during daylight hours.  It's really fast (I use a class 6 Transend memory card) between pictures.  It does take a couple seconds to recharge the flash when the battery is lower.  I read complaints of bad pixels, which I see many of when veiwing pics on the camera, but they don't appear when I upload the photos or print them out.  I also tested a few at stores and some previews looked really red toned  This was also the case with my purchase but the pics appear fine once uploaded.  The auto setting works great except for outdoor night shots.  To shoot in low light the exposure gets long and the camera must be set against somthing steady like a wall.

I was very happy with the earlier model, but this one has more bells and whistles and has a much better zoom. It also has a metal case, unlike the last version's plastic shell. I use it primarily for still shots, but it does have a video function, and is great to take when travelling and you don't want to haul a camcorder around too. It uses an SD memory card, available with up to 2 gigs of memory- plenty for storing hundreds of photos or several short videos. The rechargable battery is the square EN-EL12 type. Nikon claims you can get 200 shots before needing a recharge but I've found it to be a little less than that. Get a spare. Nikon has somewhat simplified the menu access on the Coolpix from earlier models. It's easy to move through the menu tabs and select the item you want. Downloading photos is easy. It comes with software, but I don't use it- just dump it right to my hard drive with the included mini usb cord. I'm very happy with overall camera and image quality.

I had a Coolpix 4800 for several years, and despite the fact that it boasted only 4 MP, i feel that the photos were far superior to the ones i am getting out of the s630. I was excited to find another nikon with a lot of zoom, and expected the same quality as what i had previously. Unfortunatly, i was dissapointed.Outdoors the colors are great and crisp, but i have yet to shoot an indoor shot that makes me really happy. as a mom taking pics of her kids all the time, this is frustrating beyond words. the colors take on an unnatural reddish orangey hue, and i constantly get blurring, even with image stabilization. I have tried Auto mode and scene selecter and every type of scene possible, but no matter what i do, the color quality is just off and fuzziness common. After several months i finally figured out that the best way to get my kids and not worry about them moving and therefore blurring or getting that ghostly motions quality, as they invariably do, is to use sports mode, but then the camera drops to 3MP. As a result the photos are not really crisp, which when buying a camera with as many MP as this one has regularly, it's once again, frustrating. On the plus side, I have the red one, which is really fun looking, and i love the size and the zoom is pretty close to my old 4800 (which drowned last summer :-( and is no longer working). Also, it's really comfortable in a hand of my size and has a nice thumbgrip intentation.**Update: After writing this review i realized how truly annoyed i am about my photos, so i actually contacted Nikon through their website and attached two of my photos as examples of their poor quality.  They actually told me what to change in my setting to hopefully fix the problem.  I shot a few pictures which actually seem much better, but it's too soon to tell.  I will be taking lots of pictures in the days to come and if i see a difference, i will come back, change the rating and let you know how to adjust the menu for better pics!*****update 12/29/10 while nikon was very helpful in terms of customer service, the photos are still not as good as they should be.

The first was several years ago and was a good camera. I also own Sony and Canon digital point and shoots and a Panasonic digital mega-zoom. This camera appears to be a cheap imitation of the Sony Cybershot line. It is set up almost identically. The camera feels OK as far as quality, but no match for any of the others I own. Most importantly, the image quality is absolute CRAP! Once in a while it manages to take a good picture, only then in good light, and only if I take 3 or 4 shots and hope one will turn out OK. Too much light and the image will be washed out. The flash is way too powerful & washes out low light shots. If no flash is used in low light the images are terrible as well. Any zoom over 3x is worthless as well since the shot will not be in focus. Worst of all: I bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas and expected it would be better than our Sony, which was great, but broken by our little boy. The feeling of giving a bad gift has definitely sworn me off Nikons for good. My wife has no patience for technology that is not easy to use without endless donking with the settings.

The camera is an ideal size, and conforms well to the hands when shooting. The user interface is not entirely intuitive, but if you spend a little time with the camera, it is not very difficult to figure out. The zoom range is fantastic. But the motor used to control the zoom won't let you continuously zoom in and out; it is set to allow you to only zoom to a certain number of discrete positions. I found this to be really annoying--frequently, I wanted to zoom in or out just a tiny bit, but the darn thing would jump to its next zoom zone, which would be way off-the-mark.If you are looking for a point-and-shoot camera that works very well in fully auto mode, then this is NOT the camera for you. Virtually all of the fully-automatic shots I took with this camera, particularly indoors, came out poorly exposed--typically out-of-focus, blurred, with inaccurate color rendering, or with noticeable digital noise. I found that if I took the time to go to the menu and select the proper shooting mode (for example, \"Indoor Portrait,\" \"Still Life,\" etc) to conform to the shooting environment at the time, the results were much better, though still frequently flawed.  If you are buying a point-and-shoot camera in order to actually point-and-shoot, I would argue that users generally don't expect to have to reset modes for every situation in order to get a decent shot.  (I own a 6 year old Kodak 3.1MP camera that, hands down, takes way better point-and-shoot auto-exposed photos than the Nikon S630. Unfortunately, the Kodak is fairly bulky and its viewing LCD, by today's standards especially, is very tiny--which is why am I looking to supplement it with a newer camera.)It turns out that a cousin of mine bought the same camera at about the same time, and she experienced similar results, and returned the camera.

I took the battery out while it was on so the lenses would stay out, then i took the card out too and left it sit for a few days.

I was with a friend who was taking photos in a dark restaurant of her daughter's birthday party and the photos looked fantastic.  I asked what camera she was using and it was the Coolpix S630.  I believe the camera is discontinued now, but I found it on Amazon at one of their sellers and I have been very happy with it.  What I don't like about most of the newer model point and shoots is there are TOO many features -- confusing, and not necessary.  All I'm looking for is a camera that takes good pictures.  I've tried others and liked them, but then when I see the quality of the photos I am disappointed.  The Nikon S630 takes great photos without any fussing.  Not sure why, but Nikon cameras really capture color well and the S630 is no exception -- the photos I've taken with this camera are beautiful, sharp, and easy to get.  While the camera gives you plenty of \"scene\" options, including fireworks and sunset, the normal mode is great at automatically choosing what settings to use for the scene.  All the buttons to change scenes or settings (if you feel the need) are right there on the back panel -- no searching around for them.  Very user friendly!  Another plus is the rechargeable (charger is included) Lithium Ion battery that comes with the camera.  These batteries last so much longer than AA batteries!  Though the \"movie\" option is not something I use very often, I tried it and it does a good job.  Adjusts for different lighting well, and picks up sound very well.  I will be surprised if you don't love the Nikon Coolpix S630 and the photos you can take with it.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not so Ruby Red", "Author": "Lee721", "ReviewID": "R11I7CG0A0MZZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera itself is great!

I broke my shoulder last year and as a result using my DSLR for extended periods of time has become difficult.  When our family was planning our family trip to Disney, I was concerned about being able to carry and use the DSLR day after day so I was looking around for a point and shoot that would still give me high resolution pictures and that had a good zoom lens.  I have had excellent results with the Nikon Coolpix series through the years so my first choice was this camera.  Before purchasing from Amazon, I went to local stores and did some hands on comparison shopping - comparing how the camera felt in hand, quality of construction, and response times.  This camera impressed me on all of the above.  The only concern I found (and which I had read in other reviews) is that the zoom is somewhat difficult to control.

This is a first refurbished camera that I bought because of its good price and the 7x zoom. Basing on the reviews, I think I got a good refurbished camera, not defective or abused. The image quality of this 12MP Nikon is not as sharp as my SD1100 and F40fd that has only 8MP, but I do like its style and the 7x zoom. Its pictures are usable but it could be hard to get any photo that will surprise you. Some of the pictures from the two 8mp cameras were really amazing. I have not tried the low-light photo yet, but do not expect it to be any better.Update:After using it for two weeks, I decided to add one more star for its 7x zoom and PQ with manual settings. I found its PQ was improved, to my taste, by changing some of the default settings.1. Limit the ISO to fixed range2. Use manual 2-stage focus3.

I had a Coolpix 4800 for several years, and despite the fact that it boasted only 4 MP, i feel that the photos were far superior to the ones i am getting out of the s630. I was excited to find another nikon with a lot of zoom, and expected the same quality as what i had previously. Unfortunatly, i was dissapointed.Outdoors the colors are great and crisp, but i have yet to shoot an indoor shot that makes me really happy. as a mom taking pics of her kids all the time, this is frustrating beyond words. the colors take on an unnatural reddish orangey hue, and i constantly get blurring, even with image stabilization. I have tried Auto mode and scene selecter and every type of scene possible, but no matter what i do, the color quality is just off and fuzziness common. After several months i finally figured out that the best way to get my kids and not worry about them moving and therefore blurring or getting that ghostly motions quality, as they invariably do, is to use sports mode, but then the camera drops to 3MP. As a result the photos are not really crisp, which when buying a camera with as many MP as this one has regularly, it's once again, frustrating. On the plus side, I have the red one, which is really fun looking, and i love the size and the zoom is pretty close to my old 4800 (which drowned last summer :-( and is no longer working). Also, it's really comfortable in a hand of my size and has a nice thumbgrip intentation.**Update: After writing this review i realized how truly annoyed i am about my photos, so i actually contacted Nikon through their website and attached two of my photos as examples of their poor quality.  They actually told me what to change in my setting to hopefully fix the problem.  I shot a few pictures which actually seem much better, but it's too soon to tell.  I will be taking lots of pictures in the days to come and if i see a difference, i will come back, change the rating and let you know how to adjust the menu for better pics!*****update 12/29/10 while nikon was very helpful in terms of customer service, the photos are still not as good as they should be.

THe colors are still not true to life and i still get considerable blurring, perhaps not as much as previously, but still a lot.***", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "nikon? i got a dud.", "Author": "oz zy \"waiting for the dvd\"", "ReviewID": "R2V2BKBOC4MGAT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i selected the highest quality setting, 4000*, yet the pictures were grainy, of probably a 2 mega quality. my optio 4 mega camera did much better. the colors, even in vivid mode, are washed out. very, very, disappointed in this nikon product.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "extremely pleased", "Author": "Patricia Taylor \"Pat Taylor\"", "ReviewID": "R2S916M7Y0EED8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very very happy with this product.

But, it's not as easy as I thoughtit would be.  Without the dock to use when not in use, makes it harder to use continuously.  If it wasn't for the extra battery I bought to go along with it, the evening pictures I took wouldn't have been here from our last camping trip. It's disapointing to have to change batteries every 8 hours when a dock would have kept the camera ready for use for longer time.---It's also disappointing for me to not be able to take more pictures before having to change the battery.  But, for the price I paid, that will have to be something I'll have to get use to. Let me explain!!  When you are riding on a back of a motorcycle, you must have a camera that will react to the movement and the shots that you are taking. Sometimes you will go longer than 8 hours and other times itcould be a 300 mile trip and take more than 220 pictures at a time. But if the battery goes dead before that it's a bit hard to change the battery as you move down the highway.  My other camera I had for 3 years got broke.  Spent money to get it fixed, it came back and was terrible.Don't have any idea what I was doing wrong.  So this was my next choice and it's really going to take patiences to get it to do what I want it to do and when.  When you switch like this from one to another, you will lose something and what I lost was something I came to expect. Which is what I wanted this camera to do.---As for the camera itself, I love it. Traveling as we do, it fits in my hand quite nicely and can take some great shots moving or sitting still.  I can't say that I'm disapoointed in that part of it at all. I don't take pictures of just one thing and it falls right in there with what I'm doing at the time. I'm not a pro, but some of my pictures could be used as such, that I have gotten from this camera. It's light weight and has the settings that are needed to accomplish what ever you are wanting to do.---As for the other - it will take time to get use to and I will conquer that as I go along.  Then, I'll be a happy biker and photgrapher again!!", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "not reliable", "Author": "Jules \"Jules\"", "ReviewID": "R1U5B26WT1ZAVA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a year ago.  I really liked it until the lens stopped working.  I called Nikon and my extended warranty expired less than a month ago.  They were not able to help.  They said they could repair it for $100 plus shipping to and from.  Since I purchased it on sale for $150 I didn't think that the $100 repair was worth it.  So now I have a camera I can't use at all.  I am planning on giving it to my toddler as a toy because that's all it's good for now!  I would expect a product from Nikon to last more than a year.
