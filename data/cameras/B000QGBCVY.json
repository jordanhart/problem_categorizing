{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One (or two) big flaws from perfection", "Author": "Joe W", "ReviewID": "R2KIPZMKGO0JQJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the GE A730 because it has by far the best feature set of any camera in its class at an unbelievable price. It's pocket-sized, with image stabilization, manual controls, a useful 35-140mm lens (35mm equivalent), a one-thirds grid on the LCD to help with composition and keep horizons straight, and on and on. It also has the best user manual I've ever seen. When I got it home, however, I immediately discovered its Achilles heel. I could not use the LCD in full sunlight, even at its brightest setting, and the A730 does not have an optical viewfinder. Also, the LCD is so reflective that the reflection of your own image blurs the screen even further, even in less than full sunlight. Besides that, I found that the automatic focus tended to hunt in almost all lighting conditions--though, in fairness, that could be just a flaw in the particular camera I bought, or \"pilot error\" due to my lack of experience, and not a general flaw in all A730s. I returned the camera for a refund and called GE Customer Service. I had called them once before with questions about the camera and they were savvy, polite, patient, and eager to please. When I told the person who answered about the problems I had with the A730, I could hear him typing it into his computer. He thanked me, said GE's R&D; department wanted as much feedback as possible, whether good or bad, and said he was forwarding my remarks to them \"as we speak.\" Except for the LCD (and perhaps the hunting AF) the A730 is a landmark point-and-shoot with superb features, at an unbeatable price, supported by excellent customer service. Despite my disappointing experience, I'm not giving up on GE cameras. Almost all new products have \"bugs\" in them that have to be worked out. The company seems more than willing to correct flaws, and if it does, there won't be a camera in the A730's class that can touch it. I'll watch with great interest to see if GE follows through on the feedback, and am looking forward to the release of their E850, which has a 28-140mm equivalent lens, a bit more resolution and all the other fine features of the A730. I hope GE makes the necessary corrections. They are just \"this close\" to producing a camera, backed by a customer support system, that all others will be measured by.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT Camera!! Better than the Nikon L11", "Author": "DXTAC", "ReviewID": "R2Q38QBWKF16UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 2 weeks and I LOVE IT!! I previously had a Nikon L11 and returned it due to the known issue of it just freezing up when it wants. I purchased this camera as a replacement for the Nikon. The Pros:- It starts quickly- Takes GREAT pictures- It's small/lightweight- Has great features that many other cameras in its price range can't touch (Stabilization Mode for one)- It was priced about $60 - $70 less than comparable cameras (I bought mine for $99.00 - $60.00 less than the Nikon)- It turns heads (It's finished in shiny black and chrome)- It has a quicker regeneration time than the Nikon- It fits into my wife's purse or my pocket easily- It is 7MP as opposed to the Nikon's 6MP- It has a Continuous Shot option- Operates on 2 AA batteries- 26 MB of internal memoryThe Cons:- It's physically a little larger than the Nikon, but lighter- You can not turn off the Quick Review of your pics after you take a pic. Therefore the regeneration time is extended- No flash while in Stabilization Mode- LCD screen is a little difficult to see due to the shiny case that covers it. The Nikon won this battle as it was a matte finish and very easy to see in sunlight. A small price to pay for all the other features (hold your hand over the screen)- A sometimes pixelated image while zoomed in close. No effect on the picture taken though.If I could have given a 4.5, I would have. It is a great little camera and I can't wait to see what GE has in store for the future.

We also own the Canon PowerShot SD750 < http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD750-Digital-Optical/dp/B000NK6J6Q > and frankly, the PowerShot puts the GE camera to shame.  For another $80 I would hands down recommend the Canon.  But if you are economizing, the GE is a decent unit.I also must add that after two or three months and minimal use, we found that the camera went dead. The \"on\" button merely flashed when pressed, but the camera would not \"boot up.\"I called GE customer service expecting to have to return it under warranty. The were nice enough, and responsive.  They told me the only solution is to use the expensive Lithium AA batteries.  Regular alkaline for reasons they could not explained, would not work.I tried and they were right, the lithiums worked where alkalines failed. So beware that over time you could be dumping money into expensive batteries, which admittedly last longer.  But my Canon camera has a small, rechargable cell.  So if you use this camera a lot, in a couple years you could potentially spend the extra $80 buying batteries.

This GE caught my eye mostly because it had OPTICAL ZOOM as opposed to digital...I hate digital zoom.Strangely enough, the GE was ALSO $65 at the time, so I jumped ship on the DXG and cashed in my lot with GE. I have never regretted that decision.Cracking open the box and actually trying out the camera turned out to be simple, intuitive and FUN. Even the manual controls were straightforward and yielded amazing results. I was able to go exploring and shoot for HOURS on the included batteries, and most of the time the pictures came out razor sharp. The only difficulty it had was in REALLY LOW light shots, because the camera would automatically hold the shutter open longer and motion blurred the image. Getting a cheap tripod fixed that problem.But Speaking of tripods brings up my biggest and really my ONLY gripe with the camera...the tripod mount has plastic threads. YES, the camera served me wonderfully for over 2 years and over 8000 photo, but all it took was my tripod falling over and the metal screw in the mount tore the old plastic threads out of the bottom of my camera. Ooops. My poor baby is a handheld only now...One other think I liked about the GE A730 was that if I set the 10 second timer for a photo, it STAYED ON! My tripod wasn't the greatest and tended to shimmy a little after I pressed the shutter, so those 10 seconds helped eliminate almost ALL shake from my shots. Now this may have just been a firmware or programing glitch in the A730, but every camera I tried after that, including other GE's, the 10 second timer shut off after the picture was taken. I hated that...Sure the screen is sometimes obscured a little bit in bright sun because of the beveled edges directing light into it, but it really wasn't all THAT hard to see the screen even then. My main and only gripe with the A730 is the plastic mounting threads.

After having it for only two weeks I am utterly blown away. I was skeptical of purchasing from General Electric as I had never had experiences with their imaging products. But After looking into it I felt it was worth a try, and I am impressed. It delivers on many different levels, and has all the standard features I want in a camera and then some. I am used to paying around $150 for a digital camera generally around a 3.2 MP, and for getting this one for $90 shipped I am sold on it. I had heard that the flash was a concern, that it would drain the batteries too quickly. I have had it for two weeks and have been using it to get a hang of it, figure out all the features, and I have yet to replace the batteries.The Pros:  Supports up to a 4 GB SD card allowing for almost 1200 pictures at 7 MP on best quality, or up to 120 minutes of consecutive video, making it great for camping trips where a computer connection is not feasible  Superior picture quality (might be because its my first digital camera greater that a 3.2 MP)  Many preset scene settings for anything from children and pets to fireworks and the panorama feature is amazing (takes 3 separate pictures while having a ghost image on the side to help align them))  Zoom does not diminish quality  Farley simplistic allowing most anyone to select the proper settings and take extraordinary pictures, while allowing the more experienced photographer to manually set the setting they want.
