Easy, great pics and 720p videos.For the price it takes good pics, easy to use, just a perfect next step for the kids.In fact if you are not pretending to be  \"a pro\" but want to shot some quick family /kids /situation photos and do not want to study the manual for 2 weeks, this camera takes much better pics/video/panoramas  than the smart phones, is small and light and you can just Point and Shot wihtout setting up things for 5 min first. So if you want something easy and really inexpensive -this one is a good one.I recomended for \"non serious\" photographer.99 y.o. grandma can operate it and take good shots of kids.If you are looking for $100 range camera-do not compare it to SLR...unless you find one for $100", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Accepts SD cards!

Found out that this camera produces crisp pictures, with following settings: REC mode, set it to Program Auto, Steady Shot Auto, ISO fixed manually to 100, all other settings can be left as default.Now ISO 100 will not capture far away images in low-no light scenario, but in my case I really do not care since most of my pictures are taken close to the actual object with proper or low light.I capture my images at 16:9 11M mode and it really looks good on both my PC monitor and my Plasma TV.So short story, do not use Intelligent Auto mode, it really does not work properly and probably is the reason this camera does not take crisp pictures all the times out of the box...", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good first Camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2R0KQCR7PZYCQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As my title says this was the first digital camera that I purchased for my self, and for that reason it has suited me well.The camera is slim and compact and fits nicely and comfortably in my pant pockets.  The dark \"slate\" coloring is amazing (black oddly is my favorite color).  The camera comes with various fun settings that you can play around with.  I love shooting pictures with the \"pop\" setting which saturates the  colors.  There also is a setting that allows  you to take pictures with cool or warm coloring.  And finally there is a setting that allows the camera to take black and white photos extracting only a a certain color from the shot (only red, blue, green, or yellow objects/scenery will be in color).  These settings are fun and can cut out some of the editing down and add cool effects to your photos.  There is also a crop tool built right into the camera which is also a nice feature.  Finally the price is amazing, making this an affordable choice for anyone.Finally some of the draw backs that I have found with this camera.  First and foremost, many pictures turn out blurry.  This can be extremely frustrating.  Even with a steady hand or even a tripod and they still can come out blurry.  This especially occurs in low light settings, using the flash can help but only sometimes. I can almost forget about taking clear pictures at night. I find my self frequently having to retake and retake photos.  I've taken this to museums were this problem can be extremely frustrating.  The other problem I have noticed (which is my fault really) is that sometimes the 5X optical zoom just doesn't cut it. I occasionally wish I had purchased a camera with 10x or 20x zoom.Overall I do like this camera, but I am not in love with it.  I would recommend a Canon Coolpix over this camera for it's user-friendliness and it's ability to take quality pictures without motion blur.  After only having this camera for a little less then a year, I'm already on the market for a better one.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera, with features found on a video camera.", "Author": "15 Korinth \"California girl on the loose.\"", "ReviewID": "RAZ2GZCNJA74B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-shot is a great point and shoot camera.  I've had several of the different iterations over the years.  I've also given one as a gift to my mom.  It's very easy to use with very nice results.  It's very difficult to get bad shots.  The video camera feature is a plus.  It does take video with ZOOM, sound and has photo capture (just like on the Sony video cam).  The varied body colors are a great alternative to boring black.  Its small enough to carry in your pocket or purse.  If you like the camera on your phone, but wish you had flash, better zoom, and clearer photos, the Cyber-shot would be a great camera for you.Edited February 26, 2013.***Yes, you do get the battery, a/c adapter charger, usb adapter that connects to your computer, and a starter memory card.  If you capture video with this camera, you might want to get a larger capacity memory card.  I've played around with the settings-- 4GB is about 30 minutes of video and 8 GB is about an 1hr which is perfect for filming a school assembly.  You could always transfer your output as needed to your computer, but having to do this more than once a day is a hassle especially when one is vacationing.***TIP, are your pictures coming out fuzzy?  1)  Are you taking the shots too close, not waiting for the flash, or making other amateur mistakes? 2) if not, then DO exchange the camera.  After having so many of these cameras and carrying them in my purse and dropping them, I have realized that the components just get out of whack after about a year or so.  The longer they are jostled, the more likely the pictures become fuzzy.  So if your pictures are fuzzy to begin with, return it for another one.I suppose that I could have taken my old cameras to a photo repair place.  I haven't bothered, because by then there was a newer and better camera.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera for the price", "Author": "LUIS J CASTILLO Q", "ReviewID": "R3MDK08RRQYL9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when you buy sony, you buy quality, very sharp fotos, great screen and super focus, i definitevly reccommend this camera, today they are a little higher price but it worth it", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the best camera", "Author": "D Maximo", "ReviewID": "R2UAI2DRZHL6U3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Most people don't have an appreciation of good photography. Even if they like \"good\" pictures, they don't try to learn. They just want to point and click and be done with it. That being said, this camera has way too many features. I bought it for my elderly mother and she doesn't even use it. When I take pictures for her I have to remember how. I have to wait for the green light to stop flashing (essentially giving me a green light) and hold very steady till the camera finishes. But digital cameras are like that. Another problem I have with this camera is that it's too small. If you have big hands, it makes the use of this camera clumsy. My sister has used this camera with good results.  She has small hands. I would never buy this camera (or a like sized one) for myself. It just doesn't fit my hands and makes for clumsy handling and sometimes blurry pictures. I'm a pretty good photographer.

But it certainly has issues.Specifically, the on/off button protrudes from the camera. I found that when I stored the camera in my pocket or a backpack, it would very frequently bump against some edge and turn itself on, opening the shutter. This probably made it more fragile and allowed dust/grease to enter the aperture or scratch the lens.

We used this with a $20 Polaroid underwater protecter box (purchased on Amazon) to snorkel and it worked well in movie mode, again, fish move! It gave us better pictures than we would have had with an underwater disposable with similarly slow shutter speeds and without movie mode capability.

It fits easily in a pocket or purse.I don't know if this cyber shot model is any better but I will never purchase another cyber shot again.
