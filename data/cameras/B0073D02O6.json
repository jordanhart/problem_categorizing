The image on the screen can be a bit blurry, though the camera itself takes crisp, clear photos. For the price, it couldn't be beat. This isn't exactly your, \"I'm gonna take long zoom photos of Jimmy on graduation day\", but you'll definitely get some great medium to close up shots. The interface is very easy to use. Overall, great camera to throw in a bag and always have with you, to capture those special moments.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Beatriz Borges", "ReviewID": "RRJQDY9QCN1CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked this camera really is a product highly recommend and am very pleased with the quality and the working conditions as it comes and accessories.Best Regards", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "48 hours into use it broke", "Author": "kbaa", "ReviewID": "RDBGJ6YOQS5IU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "button on back turns it on un-expectantly in addition to top normal button.

But for best photos you need to turn auto exposure setting to \"PROGRAM\"  and the ISO to \"100\", The rest of the settings can pretty much be left on auto.  Because of that I gave the camera 4 stars instead of 5 since some of its advertised features still need work and you need to manipulate them just a tad. The other reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is this - The quality of the photos and video is excellent however the quality becomes a bit lacking when you get really zoomed in. While this may be expected, it goes directly against part of what the camera is advertised to do.Overall though, I'd highly recommend this camera as something to keep with you to take high quality spontaneous photos. Like I said just remember to change those two settings because the camera is not at its best performance with default settings.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Jonathan D.

It does not take as clear pictures and it is slow to auto focus.  Also, the battery is always dead because whatever button gets bumped, it powers on.  The setup is not as straightforward and the options are less, particularly with the flash.  Instead of the several options on the previous model now there is only auto or off.

They are correct, it is super slow and I would return the camera but I threw away the box.  Also it will not connect to my computer so I can not upload the photos I did manage to take.  It is super light which is fine, plastic or metal isn't a big deal and lighter is better these days but it is by far a sub-standard product.

I've been everywhere--including their site, the disk they enclose, every Google search I can make and no one can tell me how to simply import the photos. My computer won't recognize the camera.
