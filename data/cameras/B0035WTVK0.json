The Camera is worth the price just for the HD video feature alone. A little hard on batteries so I suggest rechargeable AAs. This is probably the most compact camera I have seen that uses AA batteries, which makes it good for travel overseas. My wife just keeps it in her purse. No viewfinder, so photos outside in a bright sun are not easy. I think you can buy or fashion some type of shade for the display. A bargain at $67", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "beyond expectation", "Author": "beanrocks \"xbean\"", "ReviewID": "RSXZSR7PU1N3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera shoot decent 720P video @24 fps that NO competitor exist at this price point. And it can zoom when shooting video! One caveat, when zooming the sound are muted temporarily to prevent zoom noise being recorded. And the zoom seems to have 3 discrete stages, not zoom continuously and smoothly like some other cameras.Mine comes with firmware v1.2. When first shooting HD video I got the notorious problem, i.e. video stopped after a couple seconds. I panicked. After format the SD card with NTFS format and then using the camera to format the card again the weird problem is gone. BTW I used a class 4 SDHC 4G card.The video capability is the main factor I am looking at. But I found the photos are decent as well. I haven't shoot much photos yet. The outdoor ones looks great. The indoor ones are average, but all point and shoot type don't do well at low light. I don't like to use flash either. If you plan to do a lot indoor or low light shooting, get a DSLR and low f-number lens. It all comes down to how many photons are collected by the CCD sensor.I do need some time to adjust to the controls, button layout and menu. Switching between shooting modes is a little inconvenient as you need to go through a few steps in the menu.The power button can be easily triggered. It's a little annoying and can cause potential damage. Imagine your camera is unintentionally turned on in that small camera case, the lens has no where to extend and you are screwed. Fuji should fix this problem.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "If you have never owned a digital camera before.....", "Author": "Rocko", "ReviewID": "R7T4E45ONECWP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you have never owned  digital camera before, this camera may be perfect for you. It has great ease of use and frankly you cannot beat the price.Now having said that this camera takes awful pictures. I had a canon powershot that was almost 7 years old, in fact it was only a 3.5 megapixel, if that tells you how old. It was still taking wonderful pictures and me and my wife were happy at the great quality, until my toddler got a hold of it and finally sent out beloved cannon to the grave. I went to go replace it. Now we decided to buy a cheaper camera because reasoning would suggest that one of the cheaper models today would be hands over fists better than a camera that was nearly 7 years old. We were wrong. I was surprised at how bad some of the pictures came out, in lower light areas even with the digital scene sensor, the picture shows a horrible amount of \"noise\" and artifacts. Please note that megapixels are not quality, a camera is as only good as its lens and image processing chip, and on this one you get what you pay for.....cheap. I mention this camera is good for first time digital camera users, however it is not good for any one who likes to change the picture settings and modes or advance users. There is no picture mode wheel or buttons for settings, you must navigate several menu's in to change even simple setting which is not good for on the fly picture taking.I would have given this camera a one star rating, however you cannot beat the price if you need a camera in a hurry AND the HD video recording works pretty well. In fact the camera should be sold as a digital camcorder because it takes better movies than it does picture ;0", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera with Appetite for Batteries", "Author": "Sine Nomine", "ReviewID": "RHECBESTZPYA6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this at a camera store in an emergency because my wife said our other digital camera was too complex.  The owner said they never had one returned because of defect...So we took it to NYC and in a cafeteria on Broadway I stood up in front of everyone eating and started to photograph my wife.  The slippery camera slipped from my fingers and came crashing to the floor.  Amazing how the entire room went silent watching me.I picked up the camera and sheepishly went back to our table.  I powered it off and powered it on, and it still worked, thank goodness.I've taken some of my best photos with this little camera.  I like its digital photographs, the menu makes sense to me, and it takes wonderful photos in low light.But this camera devours its batteries.  I use re-chargeable batteries and even after inserting a fully charged battery its depleted in minutes.  I always carry a backup battery with it, and have needed it often.It's a great little camera, just look at my sunset photos here on Amazon.  But its voracious appetite for batteries is a deal breaker for me.  So this little camera sits on the shelf, way too often.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Travellers Friend", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "R1Z6HT911H0Y4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I brought this camera to carry around on those days I don't want to lug my DSLR around with me. Its use of two AA batteries (pretty much readily available anywhere) and pocketability, made this this the perfect choice.This Fuji has many modes of operation, a 720p HD mode and an ISO range up to 3200! Picture quality is good for a camera at this price point, with sharp central definition and saturated, vibrant colours. Sharpness does diminish towards the edge of the frame, but not noticeably so, unless your pictures are going to be under extra close scrutiny. My only concern is that it can be a little heavy on the batteries, so if you are going to be away from shops, and using this camera all day, then I would suggest that you carry spare batteries.All in all though, a great little camera for the price.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera at this price", "Author": "smish", "ReviewID": "R2IL33T0YRUO95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera takes some really good shots if used properly.

I had been considering getting a Flip camcorder as well, so this seemed like getting the best of both worlds. After a month, I haven't had much occasion to use the video options, but I took a few test videos and they look great, more than enough for my purposes. On my 4GB SD card, I can get about 15 minutes of HD video, and on the lower resolutions (which I'll probably use more often) I can get 30-60 minutes.The camera has tons of settings I'm still playing with, maybe more settings than a point-and-shoot camera really needs; do you really need different settings for portraits and babies? But that's certainly not a complaint. Most of the settings are familiar to me from having used other digital cameras in the past and are pretty self-explanatory, but panorama mode is new to me and works great. It takes great pictures in good light, as most cameras will. Its macro mode for closeups works surprisingly well also, though if you're extremely close up it will have some trouble focusing on the right subject. My other camera has that problem too.Taking shots in lower light or at night works a lot better than expected. Night pictures can come out a bit grainy, but they're still far better than the night pictures on my Olympus. I sacrificed on the zoom for this camera (3x optical compared to my 10x Olympus), but with a size this compact, pictures this good, and a price this low, I can't really ask for more.I'm a slightly-more-than-casual photographer, an amateur to be sure, so for any casual photographing needs this camera works great. Added bonus: after a month of use and a few hundred pictures, I'm still on the original AA batteries that came with the camera. I bought rechargeable batteries for it as soon as I got it, but I haven't had to use them yet. Battery life was a concern of mine, so that concern has long since been put to rest.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice simple and small camera", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R17ZSA18C12HX9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice, light and small - easy for a novice - I gave it to my friend who had  no experience with the digital camera - and she was up and running in a day.

Nani Moss", "ReviewID": "RVTEOAVH0JZ4Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera on a whim and without doing my homework. The price point was attractive and I figured my prior camera which broke (Fuji F20) was great and with newer camera technology they would probably be similar. Not even close.I don't know any technical jargon so I'll just keep it simple as an everyday-joe using a camera. Functionality-wise it's fine. This could have something to do with the fact I have previously owned a Fuji and can navigate through the menus without issue. However the problems start with the fact that it requires batteries instead of being rechargeable through your USB port. Over time this will easily offset any savings I got on the camera. But I purchased this without having done the homework so it's my fault on this error and I wont quibble about it.What I will quibble about is the pictures and they are absolutely TERRIBLE. When blown up to even an average size they are noticeably out of focus and the colors seem to bleed into each other. But that is nothing compared to the macro lens used for close up pictures. This might as well not even be a feature on this camera because the quality of these pics is nothing short of horrendous. I am critical of these things because I sell items on ebay and if you to the same I STRONGLY urge you to look elsewhere for a camera to take photos of your things. But even for everyday use I think that anyone who has owned a decent camera before this will be disappointed.The only dilemma I have now is how I will take a picture of this camera so that I can put it up on ebay.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12-megapixel resolution for large, photo-quality prints\nCapture 720p HD movies with sound\n3x optical zoom; 2.7-inch LCD\nPanoramic Shooting mode\nPowered by 2 AA batteries", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix AV100 12 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SZilQyaJL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035WTVK0"}}
