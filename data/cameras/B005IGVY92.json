{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exceptional camera (compared to Panasonic TS3 or FT3)", "Author": "K. Chua \"KChua\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y0PA7SS1UX4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking at waterproof and tough camera for over a year now... and I eventually chose this one!About me: I'm a techie, over 20 years in photography (started early), played with very many DSLR and compact cameras. I buy best-of-breed and I'm not very brand loyal (SLR I've used/owned include: Leica, Nikon, Pentax, Canon; Compact camera I've used/own: Canon, Panasonic, Olympus, and now Nikon).I did a lot of research (including Canon, Pentax, Olympus) and eventually narrowed down to: Panasonic TS3 (aka FT3 in Europe), Nikon AW100, Sony TX10** Sony TX10 - I love its image sensor, its rugged yet sleek ultra compactness. Unfortunately the lack of GPS killed it. For an all-weather sports camera, you expect to travel everywhere and often in areas you find difficult to mark on Google Maps.** Panasonic TS3 vs Nikon AW100 - There are many forum that compare the specs of these two cameras so I won't bore you. Both have great specs for a rugged compact; and both have similar setbacks (e.g. no RAW or manual controls, but don't forget they are not suppose to be high-end compact cameras)Panasonic TS3/FT3 is one of my final 2 because:1. Panasonic makes exceptional compact cameras (well-designed, and they're heavily invested in compact cameras, including their m4/3).  Nikon's compacts are hit or miss, and more miss actually, when compared to Panasonic or Canon seems lagging behind.2. Panasonic's TS3 is the third generation of rugged compacts... so Panasonic must have refined it and nailed everything.  Nikon has no rugged compacts and AW100 is the first - risky!3. Panasonic seems to produce very good underwater images (e.g. fishes, corals) seem more natural straight off camera.  Nikon seem to require you to set to underwater mode to ensure it corrects the color hues and color balance.4. Panasonic has a tough, metal (and seemingly more durable) feel, but that also (unfortunately) makes it heavier!.  Nikon has an aluminum-like faceplate that gives color, but overall seem to be a tough lump of plastic.Nikon AW100 ultimately won me over because:I'm a risk-taker, and take the path less traveled (or camera less proven). It's got great specs like the Panny, PLUS some advantages:1. Lightweight - For traveling, hiking, water sports, having a light camera is good. The plastic looks tough and durable.2. Greater ISO range - with ISO 3200 I can take photos in darker situations than with a Panny3. Screen is larger and higher res - 460k instead of Panny's 230k means I an see more and clearer (especially sports can be lots of misses)4. Image is higher res - can be good or bad (I hate large files), but for sports, allows me more flexibility to crop and still retain enough resolution5. Action button - this sounds gimmicky, but it actually works! It serves as a large button for GPS tracking, and changing modes without having to fiddle with buttons6. Video format - I'll save the technie talks, but safe to say, it's Apple-friendly (I use both iMac and PC), high def (1080p) at lower file size.7. Stereo sound - useful in videos where you're filming cyclist/athletes zooming past and creates more realistic feelAdditional bonus that I found very useful in practice as a sports/travel camera:8. Clock - It's clock can synchronize with your location (so don't need to worry about adjusting the clock while traveling internationally9. GPS - it actually works! It can log your route at intervals for period of 6 - 72 hrs, embed POI info, and select different levels of details10. VIdeo HS - high-frame rate slow motion video are possible with this little camera. Initially, it sounded silly but as a sports and all-weather camera, I can certainly see great uses for this feature.11. Movie light - This gives additional light to dark subject at close distance when its very dark12. Smile trigger - Kids love this... We use this instead of self-timer so that when we take a family photo, the camera detects a smile and clicks it for us.Don't get me wrong, I'm NOT saying NIKON AW100 is BETTER THAN Panasonic TS3. It's just better for my use (light to carry around in bag or even board shorts, versatile and travels to different country in sea, rain, mud etc). Honestly, I'm just pleasantly surprised Nikon can get so much right this time!*Added tip: I bought this case and find its a good snug fit Lowepro Dublin 20 Slim Profile Pouches for Cameras and Compact Video Cameras (Black/Bordeaux Red)... I posted some pics here to let you see the fit.====== <<UPDATED ON JAN 18 2011>> ========See the pics yourself. I've uploaded few pics - intentionally provided them straight out of camera - no photoshop.* PANORAMA - Quick and easy... no cropping/aligning. Just swing your camera slowly (~5sec) from one left to right or vice versa. Auto-stitched.* SNORKELING - Tried \"underwater\" and auto modes. Both work well. I did some injustice to the camera as I wasn't stable - swept by current and the fishes were all over me* CLOSE-UP - See the white flower and aphid closeup. All handheld, Auto mode, Auto flash. You can go as close as about 1cm or closer.* DYNAMIC RANGE - See the pelican photo. Backlight but still some details on the flying birds. Camera is fast/easy. I just picked up the camera and shoot.Pls click \"Was this Helpful - Yes/No\" so I know whether it helps in your decision making, and if it does, it can help more people. (I'll post updates soon and refine this review I get more use out of it). Good luck!", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera for Outdoor Use", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R3N6UUE70VZ0JJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a few days now and have been very impressed with the tests I've put it through thus far.  This camera does everything Nikon says it will and does them all wonderfully.Overall BuildThis is a small camera in your hands which is a good and bad thing.  It's great because it means it's easy to slip in your pants or shirt pocket and always keep with you.  It weighs little enough that you hardly notice it's there.  I see where some people could see this as an issue because the buttons on it are very small in order to have the back LCD as large as possible.  It does not feel cheap even though it's made out of plastic and although I don't plan on doing a drop test, I am confident it would survive a drop from chest high.Picture QualityWith an 8GB SD card I don't see a reason to shoot at any other setting than the highest resolution, so all my playing around with it was done at this setting.  The JPEGs that come out look great.  The images are sharp, have good color and the auto whitebalance has done an amazing job.  The main thing I was worried about was having to do difficult WB corrections after the fact if it wasn't right on with the WB, but so far it has been spot on in full sun shots, shady shots, indoor with incandescent and indoor with fluorescent lights.  I honestly think the 16MP is a little overkill, but will keep shooting at full resolution as I don't know when I'll need those extra pixels.  Lastly, low light shooting has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I thought with a sensor as small as this one there would be lots of noise in the final result but even at the higher ISO levels the pictures are very clear and useable.VideoI don't really plan on using this for video too much but have tested it out nonetheless.  It is very smooth while shooting at 1080p and looks great when run to my TV to view it.  The microphones pick up the noises very well and even have a setting that reduces wind noise (I tested by blowing on the microphone while recording).  To shoot video you don't have to change modes or anything - you just press the red circle button on the back and you're off.Button Placement/MenuEverything seems to get in the right place as far as buttons go.  Most can be reached with either your right thumb or right index finger while you're holding it up to shoot without adjusting, although if you are a lefty you will need to get used to holding it in your right hand.  I also shoot a Nikon d5100 and had no trouble figuring out what everything did without looking at the instruction manual, so if you've used a Nikon in the past few years this should be a breeze.  The menu is fairly uncomplicated and not overloaded with useless features.  It is quick to get to the setting I want without too many annoying clicks.  This is important to me as I had missing shots while I fumble with the buttons.Vibration ReductionI tested this out by holding the camera at arms length with one hand while shooting some test shots.  Even from the LCD I could tell the image was doing a lot less shaking than my hand was, and was very impressed by the pictures when they came out.  This will definitely come in handy on the boat.Auto-FocusHaving not used a point and shoot in a few year, I was very pleased with how far the autofocus has come.  It quickly locks on to an object, highlights the object and will keep it in focus even if you start swinging the camera around.  Going from objects ~1 foot away to 30 feet away has been focused quickly and accurately.  No complaints here.Water-ProofnessThe main reason I got this camera is so I could take it out with me when I go fishing.  This means the first chance I got, I took this camera in a pool to start testing it out.  It worked as expected, shooting at the 10 foot deep end of the pool with no problem.  The color correction for shooting underwater was also quite effective.  After taking some test shots, I put the camera in my pocket for the rest of the time in the pool just to keep it submerged for as long as possible.  After a quick towel off out of the pool, it looked good as new.  The battery/SD card door has a foolproof way of shutting and remaining watertight so unless I puncture something I'm not worried about water getting in there.GPSI have loved the performance of the GPS even when indoors.  This is something that will be very useful when I either go fishing or go out in the woods and want to take a picture of something that is in a location I want to come back to.  The GPS data is written to the metadata so I can punch it in googlemaps after I get home to see where things were.  It also has an electronic compass which is handy for a few reasons and has worked great so far.FlashIt works and it lights things up.  I've sort of grown to love to hate flashes for snapshot while using my dSLR so I try not to use it often.  It is significantly better than some of the old point and shoots I've used, so in a pinch I will rely on it.Battery LifeDon't let the tiny battery fool you - it lasts a long time.  After the initial charge, I've spent close to an hour just going through all the menus playing with things, testing out the GPS, taking dozens of pictures and videos and reviewing them on the camera after the fact and am still above 50%.  I couldn't imagine a situation where I would feel the need to purchase or bring a second battery along unless I was going to be out of civilization for a week or so.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an outdoor/waterproof camera, or someone who needs a slightly more durable camera due to butterfingers.I've been nothing but impressed with it so far and will update this review after a few months and a few fishing trips.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great photos, great video, somewhat difficult to use.", "Author": "Robert Cozzi", "ReviewID": "R37QO4I4DH4UZI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I tend to replace my point-n-shoot about every 3 years. I normally shoot a Nikon D90 but last year upgraded to a D7000.[UPDATE Feb 2012] The original camera was replaced by Nikon since it failed on the 2nd use in water. This one worked through our Caribbean holiday for 4 full days before it started overheating and would not shut off. It stayed on until the battery drained. Leaving it \"sit overnight\" and then removing and recharging the battery got it working again, however I could feel the heat the longer it was in use.The disappointing thing is this camera takes such great photos and now that we got it to work underwater, we know it takes fairly good underwater photos and video. But there's something wrong with either its design or the manufactured batch that we received. Had it too long to return to Amazon for a refund, so I'm probably going to send it a 2nd time back to Nikon. Note their repair service is great, but you have to be proactive and follow up or your repair/replacement will just sit there until you call them and ask for a status update. Once I did that after two weeks of hearing nothing and no status changes they said they'd check and the replacement was shipped out the next day.[/end-update]I took it to the Bahamas in order to test out the underwater capabilities. I also took along the D90 for \"good\" photos. After some fumbling with the crappy menu system, (its just me) I found that the AW100 photos were at least as good as the D90. The default color settings were wonderful. The video was better than expected above water, and much better than the Kodak PlaySport below water. The still photos (above water) were so good in fact, that I left the D90 in the hotel room safe for the rest of the trip.It has a 16Megapixel sensor that is back-wired. This moves the connections to the rear of the sensor which supposedly gives less noise and lower-light sensitivity. My testing at night showed this to be true for me.The bad things about it: The buttons are VERY touchy, the \"use it in the snow with big gloves on\" feature is a bit goofy, but then I haven't used it in the snow.The battery life is no where near as good a any CANON point and shoot I've owned, but with the GPS off it was acceptable.Speaking of the GPS, what a cool features. Not only do you geo-tag your photos, after you take a picture, it shows you the POI (point of interest) aka, the name of your location right on the screen. Not sure how that translates into the photo's meta data yet, but hopeful it will.All-in-all I really don't care for the menu structure which is rather limited and requires that you be in a specific MODE in order to change a setting. This is just silly IMHO.But the photo and video quality is about the best I've seen to date. So if you're looking for a simply camera, keep looking, but if you're reasonably comfortable fumbling with context menus, this may be the best imaging camera on the market today.[UPDATE]People are asking why \"3 stars\"? Because the controls are VERY touchy. While the camera image quality is beyond what I would ever have expected, the controls are difficult to use because they are so sensitive. Making use annoying.WATER PROOFING FAILED: On my second trip to the Bahamas with the camera this month, it failed as soon as I hit the water. It was working fine for the two months that I've owned it, and was even working on the Beach. But then when I went into the water, it worked for a few minutes and then DEAD...  Since it is more than 30 days old, I am sending to Nikon Service for repairs. If it comes back fine, I won't post again, but it something happens, I'll update this review again. With the U.S. holiday coming up and the timing of it being returned, I really don't expect to see it for at least 3 weeks.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A decent camera, with a few caveats", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3DMUL8IX892Z6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, a few things to know before you buy, since Nikon doesn't tell you these things until you get your owner's manual:Regardless of the size of memory card, single videos are limited to 4 GB of space (The manual says about 35 mins at the highest quality setting; the camera itself usually says 28 minutes. I haven't come close yet to maxing that out, so I don't know which is more accurate).The user manual indicates that the waterproof packing in the camera may deteriorate after a year, so it is recommended that you have it serviced yearly to replace the waterproofing (at your expense).The camera strap is supposed to be removed for underwater use. So be prepared to hold on tight, or buy your own waterproof strap!Speaking of waterproof, the camera seems to live up to its billing as such. I tested mine in perhaps the dumbest way ever: I set it down on the wet sand in the surf zone at a local beach, held on tight and let an incoming wave surge over the camera. The video turned out very cool, but I had a huge, tedious cleanup job on my hand. The sand churned up by the wave worked into every crevice on the camera. Nothing got inside (the battery and SD card were clean and dry), but every button was jammed with fine grains of sand that had to be laboriously worked out. Worst was the wheel to open the battery door. It still scrapes a bit weeks later. Bottom line, I would seriously not recommend performing this test yourself. Just take my word for it, it doesn't leak. Using it underwater is fine, but you'll want to minimize the exposure to sand.Battery life: Good but not great. At Disneyland, I started the day with a fully-charged battery and by that night it was depleted to the point where the camera shut down. I did have the GPS and compass turned on most of the time the camera was on, and did lots of chimping and deleting of photos. I left the power-off setting at the default of 5 minutes. All in all I shot 65 photos and eight videos, the longest of which was 2 minutes and 48 seconds. You will want to buy a second battery for multi-day trips or if you plan to shoot all day with GPS enabled. Battery life with GPS off seems pretty good.Still image quality: Decent to good, but not great. It is a point-and-shoot, after all. The camera performed better than I expected in low light, but I wasn't expecting a lot. I should note that it's been about five years since I last used a point-and-shoot, and my reference point for image quality is a Nikon D700 SLR. I would say the image quality is about the same or a little better than the Canon Powershot A540 that was my last point-and-shoot. The camera does tend to overexpose, so I've taken to shooting at -0.3 or -0.7 exposure compensation.Video quality: Good. I shot on the top quality setting, and the video looks smooth and sharp on my 47\" HDTV. Like most small video cameras, every sound you make, including pressing the zoom and other buttons, will be recorded.Performance: Vibration reduction and autofocus work very well and there's virtually no perceptible shutter lag. I am very impressed by the Subject Tracking AF area mode. It follows the subject better than the 3D tracking on my D700.Recording formats: JPG only for photos (no RAW); MOV for video (Quicktime).Features: If you want a lot of control over your settings, this is not the camera for you. You can turn off the flash and autofocus assist, and you can adjust exposure compensation. But you can't manually dial in your own shutter speed or aperture, and there is no bracketing, although the camera does have an HDR scene setting (an option on the Backlit setting). I tried the HDR setting and it does make a notable difference in dynamic range. You will need a tripod or somewhere stable to set the camera for best HDR results; handheld, you'll get blurring. In Auto mode (which ironically gives the most control over settings) you can select white balance, continuous shooting modes, ISO sensitivity, autofocus area and autofocus mode.Additional observations: One omission that would be really nice to have is a histogram. Since you're forced to shoot jpg, it would be nice to be able to assess the exposure with a histogram. Mine does tend to blow out a lot of highlights and I've taken to knocking down the exposure compensation to -.3 or -.7Bottom line: A decent point-and-shoot. Buy an extra battery if you shoot a lot.If you have any questions I didn't answer, feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond.UPDATE: Interestingly, another AW100 user pointed out to me that the best image quality appears to come not at the full 16MP size, but 12MP. I've started shooting at 12MP and found it to be at least as good as the 16mp setting. I've also experimented with a lens hood and filters with good results. The hood and filters can be attached using the filter holder included with the camera. The holder takes 40.5mm filters. If you stack filters or use the hood and filters together, you will get some vignetting. Zooming in a bit (to approximately the 35mm film equivalent of a 36mm field of view) eliminates that. The hood I bought is the EzFoto 40.5mm Wide Angle Metal Lens Hood Shade for Leica, Contax Zeiss, Voigtlander and other Lenses. I also picked up a Hoya filter kit with UV, ND and circular polarizer filter, and Nikon's LC-N40.5 lens cap, which works with the filters (but not with the hood, which needs a 58mm lens cap). The polarizer is very handy and helps curb the camera's tendency to blow highlights. Filters and particularly the hood do make the camera a little bulkier. I leave the filter holder and polarizer on the camera with a lens cap, and carry the hood in my pocket for the times when it's necessary. I've uploaded photos of the camera with the filter holder and hood. I highly recommend at least getting a polarizer if you do a lot of outdoor shooting.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Steps to turn GPS on Nikon Coolpix AW100", "Author": "Home Movie Buff \"Riptide360\"", "ReviewID": "R3CDE7985FY0HN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picked this camera up at the Maui Costco for a family snorkeling vacation on the way to the beach from the airport.  This camera replaced my aging Sony T7 and it's water proof case.  I liked that it had built in GPS and that I wouldn't need to use my Eye-Fi card to add geo-tags to my photos.Much to my dismay the quick reference guide makes no mention of how to turn on the GPS (off by default).  It only refers to the reference manual on CD (who carries a laptop with CD drive when travelling anymore?).  I finally found it here on page 85:[...]Here are the steps for anyone googling how to turn on GPS on their Nikon CoolPix AW100:- turn on your AW100 camera (push the small rectangle button at top of camera)- push the GPS/Action large rectangle button on the left side of the camera (screen should show a world map)- push the MENU rocker button on the lower right corner of the camera (bottom right from the screen)- you should see the choice for GPS options.  Use the OK button to turn it on (off by default).- you can then turn on \"Record GPS data\" to add the GPS data coordinates to your JPEG images.- while you are here you should also have your camera sync time/date stamp with the GPS satelitte (you have do to this everytime you change time zones).Important note: The GPS data is added to your JPEG image file as EXIF data (date photo taken, camera model, camera settings, etc) so if you post these photos online the GPS data can be revealed - something to be careful of when posting photos publicly from places you may not want people to know about (like your home's location).Now when you press the GPS button on the side of the camera you will see markers wherever the photos have been taken.  This setting only works for new photos you take, it can't be added retroactively to previously taken photos.  GPS data is only stored on photos where the camera was actually able to see 3 or more satellites.  All of my underwater photos did NOT have GPS info added to them, so be sure to take a few surface shots to get your location recorded for future reference (ie favorite dive spot).I've posted a few snorkeling photos so you can see the image quality underwater as well as read the GPS info from where the above water boat photo was taken in Maui.Couple of notes on product improvements: Although the strap says it is to be removed for use in water it holds up fine.  Make sure you soak camera for 10 minutes in fresh water after use in the ocean to remove the corrosive ability of salt water.  Would be nice if Nikon included a float with the camera or at least a bright colored water proof strap so you can find it after it sinks to the ocean bottom.  be sure to move camera slowly in water and never spray water on the camera - both cause increased water pressure which can exceed the 10m pressure it was designed to resist.Software like Apple iPhoto and Google Picasa can display your JPEG GPS info along with the image.

I recorded all images at the least compressed mode (*), and images stored at 6-7.5 mp.  The video I shot was at 1080p, 30fps.  For a memory chip I used a sandisk 16gb class 10 extreme.  I was happy with this setup and the performance of the camera was quite good.  I took photographs at 30-35 feet under water for 45 minutes on the second dive at Cozumel, shallow because the first dive was really deep (110 ft, and the camera was in the boat for this dive).  The camera preformed beautifully underwater, good movies and good images.  Great color rendition, very accurate using underwater mode.  The maximum depth the camera went to on that dive was 41 ft, for a couple of minutes.  No issues noted.  I also took the camera cavern/cave diving in the \"Cenotes\", which bottom out around 40 ft.  Great light filtered through the 'roof', good pictures.  Again no complaints.  I took the camera out when my wife and I were body surfing and if beach mode is chosen these are really good point and shoot photographs.  For land shots we took some of the jungle and ruins on scenery mode and these are very nice.  Exposure control and color are very good, and the image compression engine was fast and not overtly 'lossy'. Focus remains sharp. My other camera is a Nikon D80 with a big lens.  Will this camera take pictures at that quality?  No, not if you want it blown up 40-60in, as I have done with images from the D80.  But, these look like they will easily look good at 20-30in, and the camera is tough.  Clearly my D80 isn't going anywhere near the water, but the jungle and ruins shots would have been possible and probably great.  For the first time I left the D80 behind, and at the end of the vacation, sunsets, scenery, jungles, animals, snorkeling, scuba and all the adventures have good pictures documenting the trip.  Several are probably good enough to classify beyond vacation shots, but actual 'images or photographs'.  High quality, well proportioned, perfect lighting, and accurate focus and color.  I tried and was successful in a couple of depth-of-field studies, and was surprised at the result given the tiny lens.  Again, does it match the level of control and ability of the D80, No.  But is it really good - yeah.  My wife and I ski, climb, scuba, snorkel, backpack, raft, mountain bike, and kayak.  This camera looks to be a good fit for that, and the D80 with the big lens is going to get less use.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Waterproof", "Author": "Zweeper", "ReviewID": "R1BYP24SEH8KGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As noted in many other reviews, the waterproofing on this camera is not reliable.  When I received the camera, I carefully examined the seal around the battery/card compartment for any dirt, sand or lint.  As a Nikonos owner for many years (a camera that successfully went on 100+ dives), I understand the importance of a clean seal.  After familiarizing myself with the functions of the camera on land, I look it snorkeling.  Diving from the surface, I didn't go to a depth of more than ~10 ft.  After a going under a few times, I noticed condensation at the edges of the screen.  Given that it was hot and humid when I went in the water, this was not troubling (the manual said this might happen).  After about 20 minutes in the water, however, the camera started to malfunction, eventually stopping altogether.When I got out of the water after less than an hour, the camera was not working at all.  I soaked the camera in fresh water, and then let it dry for several hours.  When I opened the battery compartment, there was quite a bit of moisture and the contacts on the card and battery were already beginning to discolor.  I removed them from the camera and allowed it to air for another 24 hours before replacing the battery.  The camera was completely dead.  I returned it (with no questions asked by Amazon due to their great returns policy) and will not be re-ordering this camera.One other complaint: the camera ships with a battery charger that requires a separate cord.  Nikon knows how to make a charger with an integrated plug.  Why not offer it as part of the original equipment rather than an upgrade?", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shocked, yet amazed at the same time!", "Author": "Mykers", "ReviewID": "R1IGJD0C09NOZZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hello all,Please read \"oz zy \"waiting for the dvd\" review first before you continue with mine....Alright folks after two full days of accurately testing the Nikon Coolpix AW100 camera, I feel it's time for a partial review:A little background, I wanted a rough and tough camera that I could put to the test physically. I have two young children and pictures are the greatest way to capture wonderful moments. Nonetheless, low-light conditions were always a huge problem in our house.First, the picture quality is great. I just came from a Canon elph 7.1 MP camera. After shooting a total of 232 pictures on the Nikon, the quality is much better can Canon respectively, and obviously. The one thing that most individuals will not like is the lack of options to manipulate the lighting effects. The Nikon itself is made for dummies- and I use this loosely. I do not intend to placate anyone as a \"dummy.\" I am merely stating the obvious once you have this camera in your possession.Moving forward with the quality, I have read some reviews stating that low light conditions really aren't that great. I do beg to differ, I come from a Townhome that is very dark and all low light pictures came out great once you select, \"the low light feature\", or select auto, which in turn will automatically select low-light conditions. The low-light pictures come out good, not great. Most cameras out there like the Sony TX10 (I think) did not perform well in this aspect.As for the video quality, it is indeed good. The HD video on this camera is the reason I gave it three stars. The reason for my rating, is not the quality it's the zoom (please refer to Oz zy's review). Once you start recording, the low light conditions I feel are really good. My videos came out decent enough for me wanting to keep the camera. I had also tested the Sony TX10, and I thought the Nikon was much better.Now onto the zoom! Once you depress the zoom button you are in for a big surprise. Of course, this surprise does not reveal itself until playback. It appears like oz zy has stated, you indeed hear the zooming from the lens which sounds like a cat purring. On my camera alone, the zoom sounds louder (quite a shock). Furthermore, this was only half the problem. The other problem I encountered was depressing the zoom button alone. Once depressed, you can hear a loud knock or bump (describing it verbally is difficult) each time you press either zoom button. This alone sounds aweful. IF you attempt to film a quiet seen, this will be the only annoying noises you will hear.I was shocked when I heard how loud the zoom, and buttons were on playback. There is a positive in all of this, I guess- It appears the microphone on this unit is very strong and accurate. Almost to strong in a sense to be troublesome depending on how you view this. The only other reason I can think of these noisy buttons is because the unit is waterproof...The unit/casing is very sturdy. My wife is under 5 feet, and she is prone to accidents (sorry sweetheart). After about 12 minutes of her testing the camera, WHOOPS she dropped it. The Nikon made a thud on the floor, and she looked at me with fright. She was surprised that the camera was unscathed and was able to resume its duties in this house.Following this, I had sub-merged the camera in water 2 separate times: the first, in about one foot of water for 6 minutes, the second, 8 feet of water for 12 minutes. Both times the camera came out fine. I did test a couple of basic pictures underwater and they appeared fine. (please note, Nikon recommends you have the camera serviced once a year because the gaskets that help lock out the water where the battery/memory cards are located can wear).All in all the camera was a good pick up. Again, I was unimpressed the with functionality or lack of with the zooming and buttons on playback. I also want to reassure you that not using zoom for the video recording looks great, and performs very well with the Nikkor lens. I am NOT an expert reviewer so please be gentle upon posting comments. Hopefully, this will help some individuals decide whether or not this is the right camera for them. In the meantime, my rating of three stars still stands.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor design, failed in weeks, returned", "Author": "mikez11", "ReviewID": "RQLI82IRXXH1K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera failed after about 330 exposures and a week of light beach/resort use.The LCD display became splotchy and intermittent, and the camera would not always wake up on powerup (removing and replacing the battery sometimes jogged it to life).Splotchy \"fogging\" of the LCD might have been a symptom of moisture infiltration, or an electrical failure. Symptom appeared more than 24 hours after a water exposure, with no battery access.Other pros and cons, should reliability improve:PRO+ The panorama feature is very good+ Vibration reduction seems to work well in video mode (although the sound is poor).CON- The camera is VERY slow to boot up, change modes, display menus...- The GPS feature is not intuitively easy to turn on and off, it's quite easy to forget it is on, and it apparently consumes battery power even when the camera is turned off. So it is quite easy to put the camera down for a while and then find it completely dead next time it's needed.- Autofocus is slow to converge, and easily confused. These days one should not have 1/3 of images come out focused poorly, especially simple ordinary vacation snaps. Special focus modes seemed no better than the \"default\". Macro mode rarely converged focus quickly the first try, even if the subject was within range from the start.- Exposure was hit-and-miss. Beach mode totally washed out (at the beach). Indoor shots did not seem able to access the full range of available ISO even in \"Auto ISO\" mode, leading to unnecessarily long (shaky) time exposures. Fill-in-flash was almost impossible to get right. Night shot (flash + time exposure) almost useless.- Menus are not arranged intuitively, and depend on context without reminding the user. For example, mode-specific menu options are confusing, because the current mode is not obvious unless you remember previous selections.- Buttons are small and have poor tactile feel (for an AW/outdoors camera they should be LARGE)- Button labels are tiny and have poor contrast (again, they should be BIGGER and MORE VISIBLE for a camera designed for water or outdoor conditions).I am an experienced amateur with several excellent Nikon SLR's and Canon compacts. This camera was evidently not properly engineered or tested, and does not deserve Nikon's mark. While on paper it has great features, I was dissatisfied with its usability and controls, very disappointed with the quality of the few picture I did get, and very irritated that it stopped working. I returned it for a refund.

After considerable research the Panasonic Lumix TS3 seemed to be the top dog for rugged cameras.  In favor of the Lumix, I liked the durable feel and overall fit and finish, the wide angle lens and I think people willing to play around with settings will have nice options.  Unfortunately, the lumix was quite bad in low light situations and overall had soft photos.  I recently saw the Nikon AW100 on sale locally and decided to try out the latest and greatest rugged (at least I hoped so with nikon's recent attempt in the waterproof market).  With limited testing and no underwater use I decided I preferred photos taken with the AW100 better and returned the lumix.  I am happy with the contrast and low light photos of the AW100 and hope I made the right choice for my vacation.-1/2 star: One thing I hate about the Nikon is the battery charger with it's separate long cord.  Come on this is a $300 camera designed for outdoor/travel use, but you can't include a portable battery charger with the flip out plug!!! I really don't need this extra weight in my travel bag.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera for Outdoor Use", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R2IWQKRW81YCQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a few days now and have been very impressed with the tests I've put it through thus far.  This camera does everything Nikon says it will and does them all wonderfully.Overall BuildThis is a small camera in your hands which is a good and bad thing.  It's great because it means it's easy to slip in your pants or shirt pocket and always keep with you.  It weighs little enough that you hardly notice it's there.  I see where some people could see this as an issue because the buttons on it are very small in order to have the back LCD as large as possible.  It does not feel cheap even though it's made out of plastic and although I don't plan on doing a drop test, I am confident it would survive a drop from chest high.Picture QualityWith an 8GB SD card I don't see a reason to shoot at any other setting than the highest resolution, so all my playing around with it was done at this setting.  The JPEGs that come out look great.  The images are sharp, have good color and the auto whitebalance has done an amazing job.  The main thing I was worried about was having to do difficult WB corrections after the fact if it wasn't right on with the WB, but so far it has been spot on in full sun shots, shady shots, indoor with incandescent and indoor with fluorescent lights.  I honestly think the 16MP is a little overkill, but will keep shooting at full resolution as I don't know when I'll need those extra pixels.  Lastly, low light shooting has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I thought with a sensor as small as this one there would be lots of noise in the final result but even at the higher ISO levels the pictures are very clear and useable.VideoI don't really plan on using this for video too much but have tested it out nonetheless.  It is very smooth while shooting at 1080p and looks great when run to my TV to view it.  The microphones pick up the noises very well and even have a setting that reduces wind noise (I tested by blowing on the microphone while recording).  To shoot video you don't have to change modes or anything - you just press the red circle button on the back and you're off.Button Placement/MenuEverything seems to get in the right place as far as buttons go.  Most can be reached with either your right thumb or right index finger while you're holding it up to shoot without adjusting, although if you are a lefty you will need to get used to holding it in your right hand.  I also shoot a Nikon d5100 and had no trouble figuring out what everything did without looking at the instruction manual, so if you've used a Nikon in the past few years this should be a breeze.  The menu is fairly uncomplicated and not overloaded with useless features.  It is quick to get to the setting I want without too many annoying clicks.  This is important to me as I had missing shots while I fumble with the buttons.Vibration ReductionI tested this out by holding the camera at arms length with one hand while shooting some test shots.  Even from the LCD I could tell the image was doing a lot less shaking than my hand was, and was very impressed by the pictures when they came out.  This will definitely come in handy on the boat.Auto-FocusHaving not used a point and shoot in a few year, I was very pleased with how far the autofocus has come.  It quickly locks on to an object, highlights the object and will keep it in focus even if you start swinging the camera around.  Going from objects ~1 foot away to 30 feet away has been focused quickly and accurately.  No complaints here.Water-ProofnessThe main reason I got this camera is so I could take it out with me when I go fishing.  This means the first chance I got, I took this camera in a pool to start testing it out.  It worked as expected, shooting at the 10 foot deep end of the pool with no problem.  The color correction for shooting underwater was also quite effective.  After taking some test shots, I put the camera in my pocket for the rest of the time in the pool just to keep it submerged for as long as possible.  After a quick towel off out of the pool, it looked good as new.  The battery/SD card door has a foolproof way of shutting and remaining watertight so unless I puncture something I'm not worried about water getting in there.GPSI have loved the performance of the GPS even when indoors.  This is something that will be very useful when I either go fishing or go out in the woods and want to take a picture of something that is in a location I want to come back to.  The GPS data is written to the metadata so I can punch it in googlemaps after I get home to see where things were.  It also has an electronic compass which is handy for a few reasons and has worked great so far.FlashIt works and it lights things up.  I've sort of grown to love to hate flashes for snapshot while using my dSLR so I try not to use it often.  It is significantly better than some of the old point and shoots I've used, so in a pinch I will rely on it.Battery LifeDon't let the tiny battery fool you - it lasts a long time.  After the initial charge, I've spent close to an hour just going through all the menus playing with things, testing out the GPS, taking dozens of pictures and videos and reviewing them on the camera after the fact and am still above 50%.  I couldn't imagine a situation where I would feel the need to purchase or bring a second battery along unless I was going to be out of civilization for a week or so.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an outdoor/waterproof camera, or someone who needs a slightly more durable camera due to butterfingers.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fail.", "Author": "Tam Le", "ReviewID": "R3HFJLP3JESZ7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't think I've ever written a review even after years of buying off of Amazon, but I feel obligated to save others from the experience I had with this product.I bought this camera for a trip to Thailand and Vietnam this past summer, and also for future water related activities.  After using it the second time in water, first time snorkeling, second in a pool:  it broke.  I wasn't using it abusively, but somehow water leaked into the camera and it started acting up.By the time I got to Vietnam, the camera would take a single picture and then shut off.After taking it out kayaking in the ocean in Vietnam, it died for good.After the camera died I went scuba diving, jetskiing, and white water rafting.  All without a waterproof camera.There are a lot of good things about this camera (panorama, gps,etc.) and those features swayed me to overlook the negative reviews which actually documented this waterproof issue.So I won't waste your time with the pro's of this camera, when it fails miserably at the most important feature which is it's waterproof-ness.When I get another waterproof camera that survives, I'll update this review with a recommendation.  Hope this helps!", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best For The Outdoor Adventurer", "Author": "av8r", "ReviewID": "R1UMMRBJXKGN3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I selected the Nikon AW100 over the TX-10 because of a better external form (TX-10 too hard to hold securely, sliding cover, and 3 seal points in 2 doors) and over the TS-3 with hopes of slightly better image quality and a better GPS performance. And over both, with hopes of using the included 40.5 mm filter adapter to attach to my Vortex Razor 85 scope's filter thread based camera adapter for digiscoping. The plastic 40.5 mm filter adapter attaches firm enough that I am confident the physical thread attachment will carry the off-center load. I am waiting for a filter step up ring to arrive to check out the optical compatibility and will update my review later.Update on digiscoping experience (11/4/11).The AW100 can be a great digiscoping camera, no matter what the weather conditions. I received the step-up filter adapters and mated the camera to my scope via the Razor digital camera adapter (RZR-DA) and the included AW100 40.5mm filter attachment. The attachment was just right for letting the camera hang onto the scope's eyepiece for taking pictures, pressing the buttons, etc, but I would not recommend transporting the scope with the camera attached as the plastic filter ring simply snaps into the AW100 via a single small catch point under the lens.The optical compatibility produced very nice high magnification images. The non-protruding lens is very convenient to getting fairly close to the eyepiece of the scope. The wide angle zoom setting on the AW100 produce moderate vignetting (not unusual for digiscoping) but increasing to full optical zoom eliminated most of it. I used the timer to release the shutter to let vibration damp out as there is no remote release. The 2 sec setting is a little short and the 10 sec is a little long though. With wildlife shots, using a high ISO for faster shutter speed and manual release will be the way to go. I haven't explored the AW100's hybrid vibtration setting, but that may help too.First impressionsThis is my first weatherproofed camera and I have had it for a week. I have used several other P&S; and DSLR cameras, but do not make my living taking images. Build quality is very good with nice image quality and plenty of features. I will say this camera won't replace the high IQ cameras where fine detail in grass, trees and textures is of high importance. Nor for the person who wants RAW or lots of manual control or who desires to do a lot of cropping. This camera is for the person who wants to capture their outdoor adventures in photos and videos no matter what the conditions and is willing to pay a premium over conventional P&S; cameras. The AW100 images have a slightly soft look and zoomed-in fine detail tends to disappear by the image processing even at the lowest ISO. But the colors and general image quality are good enough for most users who just want a nice adventure picture to share with others in printed or online form. The 16MP CMOS element doesn't produce the IQ I'd hoped for, but I am still happy considering the compromises involved. 2x zoomed images shot at 5 MP generally look almost as good as the 16MP on my computer monitor, so the extra pixels are not adding that much benefit. Night and low light looks pretty acceptable with expected increase in noise.FeaturesThe buttons on the back are small and close and a little finicky for large fingers. You must read the manual (pdf only) to keep from wondering why something doesn't work as expected (there are quite a few inter-dependent feature settings to understand and there's lots that are not intuitive). Plenty of different still and video settings/scenes that cover most P&S; situations. This would not be a good manual control form factor anyway. The menu system is logical, and varies with the mode you are in so you are presented with only the applicable settings. The camera's GPS metadata geo-tagging has worked well on both the built-in map and Google Earth. Macro works well and the built in flash can even be used while in macro. The monitor is bright and clear and I don't miss the higher resolution on other cameras like the TX-10.PerformanceI am using a 16G class 10 Sandisk SDHC and am happy with the overall focusing, snap, and writing performance. The fast action button could be useful if you have it set up right, even being able to start the video using the large side button. Although you need to take care to press in the center as it will not actuate if pressed slightly off-center. Battery life can vary significantly depending on whether you have GPS turned ON or are doing a lot of HD video. I would highly recommend getting a 2nd battery at a minimum.VideoLots of choices in the settings. 1080p30 works well replayed in the camera, but 1080p as replayed on my desktop had a jerky characteristic. 720p30 plays smoothly so I suspect its a moderately old desktop processing issue. High and low speed video also work well, but this is not a professional videographers tool. Again, great for catching the outdoors and sharing with friends. The dedicated video button is nice if not a little small and hard to find by feel. Time from button push to record is less than 1 second. Video sound replayed from the camera is very faint. Replay on other devices has good sound but zoom and focus motors are easily picked up (stated in the manual)I dunked it into a water-filled sink to see if there was an obvious defect in the seals - still worked afterwords. All these waterproof cameras state to replace the seals annually and the AW100 is no exception. One concern about the Sony TX-10 was it had a total of 3 seals in 2 doors, so I was more interested to have a tight locking single door and the AW100 at least looks the part. I don't intend to drop test it.All in all I am satisfied with this camera. I gave it a four star rating as I would want slightly better image quality and more usable buttons.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures BUT............", "Author": "Stephen Caruso

The pictures are PERFECT but I'm going to return it,, here's why....", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waterproof, great features good entry into the Market", "Author": "sam rootjanapunt", "ReviewID": "R2WW3SX0Z8YEP7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little background so you know where I'm coming from.I use to be a point and shooter like everyone else then fell in love with photography. From there I started to accumulate DSLR and equipment like crazy. Learning and stumbling as I go but eventually good pretty good at the concept. Now I take photos on a semi professional level. I am not professionally trained or I feel I know more a little more than the average bear.Now on to the review...With all the standard features most other cameras comes with and then some. 16mp..1080p etc. I'm sure you guys know all the specs by now if you're reading this.Since I've own many Pentax Optio waterproof, kodak playsport, Olympus rugged cameras I'm pretty familiar with many of the competition. Their  strengths and pitfalls.Nikon has been on the side line as the point and shoot rugged/waterproof camera was passing them by.What I like about the Nikon that convinced me to buy it. It was between this or the Canon D10. I did not get the D10 because the shape made it too bulk and it only did SD video.Nikon Glass (I own most all their pro glass.. so I'm a big fan)The waterproof latch is infallible. I've had pentax bumped while underwater and it was toast.Macro lets you get super closeFilter adapter, lets me use polarize filters. A must for when on the water and better colors.Wide 25mm, love it.Turns on quicklyNice feelGPS is nice but I could live with out. Besides by the time the thing locks on I'm already finished with my snap shots.Excellent point and shoot images. Not as good as the DSLR by any means but for a point and shoot its good.HD 1080p video yes, but the nice toy is the 240fps and 120fps slow motion mode. Yes its lower res but still fun to play with.Don't expectRaw mode or Manual modeI've used it several times and has put up videos on Youtube and such. Stills, underwater stills, video in slow mo, underwater, I'm testing it all.Overall, this was a good first entry for Nikon. It had 90% of the features I was looking for and at the moment I'm pretty satisfied.It is a great little vacation/adventure camera.It is not a replacement for your DSLR and it does not try to be.ps.

Hall", "ReviewID": "R1AENYHZ3WNY0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shoot a Nikon D3100 when I'm in the states, but I wanted something of similar quality (picture quality) to carry with me while in Afghanistan.  I knew I wanted/needed it to be able to take a beating cause it was definitely not going to be babied.I couldn't be happier with this camerea.  I haven't shot many pictures with it, but I'm super happy with the results I've gotten so far.  For a point and shoot its got very little noise and the VR works great.It feels very sturdy in your hand and not like a flimsy piece of junk like some other ruggized cameras I looked at.  It takes good low light photos, with acceptable grain.  This is what I really wanted it for, as the old Canon it was replacing you couldn't make any manual adjustments.The one feature they don't discuss and the one I was most surpised about how much I like it is a built in panoramic feature.  The camera will assist you in taking either 180 or 360 panoramics.  It will either perform the stitching for you and produce a single panoramic or take the needed individual shots for you to stitch later.  I've found this an awesome feature for here in Afghanistan for taking deployment pictures of the scenic landscapes here.I highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants/needs a camera to take places they don't feel comfortable taking their DSLR, as this is the niche it fills for me.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "50 / 50 chance it will survive", "Author": "MamaBear", "ReviewID": "R20RTUDNR01APH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera functionality works great!

nikon website, nikon says this is a gray market camera. fortunately the optional \"canopy\" warranty will take care of repairs.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Camera.  Almost Perfect.", "Author": "John Orleans \"International Man of Leisure\"", "ReviewID": "R3HW2ARI38PKKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for backpacking, family camping trips, and our annual Hawaii trip.  I needed something that was extremely scratch-resistant, tough enough to be banged around in a backpack, water- and sand-resistant for the beach, and good for capturing important memories.  It has performed admirably, with a few notes and exceptions.First, read the manual.  If you do, your life will be easier.  Really.  IF you bother to read the manual, you will find that there are drainage ports built into the camera to help clear it when you get out of the water.  The camera's not leaking, it's draining.  Also, if you, say, leave the camera in the bright sun for a while, then take it snorkeling, the lens will fog up.  It's physics, not a design flaw.  The fog should clear after 10 - 15 minutes, but may take much longer, depending on the temperature differential.  After each use in water, the camera should be gently rinsed in fresh water or else the seals may crack and leak.  These were the vast majority of the complaints about the camera that could have been resolved by taking 15 minutes to RTFM.Batteries:  I found the battery life to be pretty excellent.  After two days and about 60 photos (GPS on, Compass off), the battery was still at 80%.  The unit comes with a 1050 mAH battery, but 1500 mAH batteries from Japan are available pretty cheap.  The aftermarket battery lasted through a whole day of snorkeling and four separate sessions of 5-minute videos.Sound:  I found the sound quite good.  Dolby THX?  No.  But I could hear what was said and it was in stereo.  Bonus points?  My snorkeling videos sound like Darth Vader shot them.Video:  Pretty fracking amazing.  5 stars, seriously.  Sharpness, focus, and color saturation were right on.  Sure, I would have loved image stabilization, but this is a point-and-shoot camera, not a video camera.SD Card:  Oh, wait.  The AW100 doesn't come with an SD card.  Oops.  Nikon has a very limited list of approved memory cards.  I went with a 64GB Patriot, Class 10 SD card.  It wasn't on the approved list, but I've had good luck with them before.  Maybe not my best move.  The camera definitely \"lost\" a few shots, but nothing heart-breaking.  On the other hand, I didn't spend $200 on a memory card.  The camera lets you know when it didn't capture the image.  I just restarted the camera and everything worked fine.Images:  Solid.  The camera doesn't really do the best job with strong back-lighting, but everything else was great.  Underwater, action shots, night portraits, drunken oh-crap-don't-drop-it shots all turned-out with embarrassingly fine detail.Other Stuff:  There are a few things I found lacking.  The included software was pretty much crap.  It did nothing better than the photo transfer wizard baked into Windows.  The data transfer cable?  Well, it worked about half the time.  Hey Nikon, is there any reason we can't just use a USB cable to recharge the battery?  Though lightweight, the recharging unit is bulky and delicate.  Did I forget to mention that the camera doesn't come with an SD card?", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "good carry around camera", "Author": "Code Monkey", "ReviewID": "R1USLAGCJD5OW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to preface this with the disclaimer that I am a \"semi\" professional photographer and so I am very, very picky about image quality.  I compared my new aw100 against my Canon 60D with the 24-105 L lens. not fair I know, but life's not fair.Of course the 60D blew it away, but I was still impressed by the aw100. the macro is decent, images are good quality. nice set of presets (indoor, pets, underwater etc...). would I use this camera for a photo shoot, no. but as a small, lightweight rugged camera that I can easily carry in a pocket, it impressed me. this will be the camera I take with my hiking, to the beach, boating or anywhere else I where getting the best possible shot is not worth risking $4K worth of camera gear. I even stuck in my Koi Pond to see how it did underwater. I wish I had this camera when I went snorkeling instead of the cheap disposable underwater camera I had. I may even leave my Canon at home the next time I travel over-seas. lugging a backpack full of lenses and cameras halfway around the world is not as fun as you would think.Pros:decent image quality for a point and shootgood video quality and I like the one button record featurelow shutter lag as long as you are not using red-eye reductionbuilt in GPS and world maps (very cool for travelers)lots of presets for the non-pro users and the smart auto settings seems to work wellCons:colors are a little more muted than I would likea little bit of jpeg compression artifacts at high magnification (most users would probably not notice or care)poor low light performance. (typical of most point and shoots, better than some)Bottom Line:if you are looking for a camera that you can take anywhere and get decent pics, this is a good pick. Picky people like me may not be 100% satisfied with the images, but for posting online or any non-professional use you should be more than happy. when you weigh the less than stellar images against loosing or breaking your big expensive DSLR, it is no contest. Can't wait for scuba diving this spring.NOTE: camera does not float, so if you plan on taking it boating or around water deeper than 33 feet, get a floating strap for it.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "surprisingly good waterproof point and shoot", "Author": "Wingfoot 3A", "ReviewID": "R2SRSYVKR504HD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the camera for an over seas trip, but also used the item for a Hawaiian vacation. The camera was used in and out of cold waterfalls, toted along as i jumped from a 20 ft drop into a water hole mixed with sea and fresh water; as well as snorkeling off a beach without ever fogging up. the camera froze on me once, had to go back to shore, patted the battery compartment dry before opening and forced the camera to power cycle manually, went back within a few minutes in to the ocean without a hitch. The battery life depends on usage, i found that with the GPS function as well as movie mode drained the battery quicker than without those functions being used, but i still was able to get one days worth of vacation shooting on a 4 gb card. The GPS function is definitely helpful when you get back home from vacation in order to remember the places you've been. sometimes it takes the camera some time 10-15 minutes before the camera picks up your location depending on your over head cover. The camera does surprisingly well in low light conditions as well as 5-10 ft shots underwater, the colors at 5-10ft still come up well and require minimal color correction through Photoshop. The weakness is long distance evening shot focus, but i didn't really expect the camera to have that ability, manual focus is usually more precise; i couldn't find that function on the camera, will continue to play around with the camera to see if that function exists. Additional functions that would be helpful would be delayed shot capability for night shots, i figure that could be a software function update.

I got pictures that no one else could imagine.  We were on the beach, out in the water, under water, and panorama shots of the beach from the water while I was swimming.  Battery lasts a long time, the GPS feature is awesome and the waterproof is the best.  YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU OPEN THE CAMERA DO NOT DO IT ON THE BEACH.  Like any other waterproof device you need to make sure every spec of dirt and dust is out of the seal or the camera will leak.  A piece of sand will make the seal no longer waterproof.  Every other review that said it leaked was correct, but its because you didn't make sure it was clean and clear of dirt when you sealed it.  Putting a piece of sand in a waterproof seal is like putting your hand out the car window while trying to close it, it will NEVER seal properly with dirt in it.When saltwater dries it leaves a residue that will make the seal ineffective.  I am a scuba diver and what I do will all my waterproof electronics is this.  If you can rinse off the device immediately, if avoidable don't open until you are home.  Soak if for 10 minutes in room temperature water to dissolve any salt, let it dry and open it the next day or later that evening.There is a condensation issue but that is environmental.  If your camera is in the hot sun, and you bring it under the cold water you will get some interior condensation, just like walking into cold air conditioning from the hot sun, or walking in from the cold into a hot building.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "PERFECT for the beach.", "Author": "Big Fudge", "ReviewID": "R2WW3MAJHFFYRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

I just got back home, super pissed. Before leaving, I tested its \"waterproofness\" in the sink and it seemed okay. The macro worked great underwater. I used all the different features the week before the trip so I would be comfortable with it. Everything worked great. I was stoked. First day in Hawaii I snorkeled with it and it seemed great. Great pictures. On the second day I snorkeled and it worked great. The next day I noticed some moisture inside the lens so I removed the battery and memory card and left the battery cover open to let it air dry overnight. I figured maybe I opened the battery cover too early when I transferred the pics from the second day to the computer and some water got inside. No big deal. Checked it the next day and it seemed bone dry, crystal clear lens. I was excited to use it again. We went back down to the water for some more snorkeling, within 30 seconds the lens was fogged up so I immediately started for the beach. One minute later it was dead! Totally non-responsive. I dried the outside (as I had done EVERY time before opening the battery cover) and found the camera FULL of water. The seal seemed perfect, it was latched. I couldn't figure out where it was leaking from. For the next three days I tried everything to get it to dry out so I could use it as a \"normal\" camera. Fail. Dead. So pissed, I was really looking forward to using it for some good pics of all the tropical fish. I returned it yesterday. The problem I have is that I really loved that camera when it worked and hope it was some kind of fluke so I can buy another one. I didn't get sand in the seal, I didn't drop it, I babied that camera and it failed in the second weak of ownership!

Received the camera and spent a few days getting familiar with it.  I thought it would be a good idea to check the camera for \"waterproofness\", so I submerged it into a bucket of tap water for about 20 minutes.  As soon as I put it in the water, a large bubble of air came from the case, and I thought that was odd.  After 20 minutes, I tried taking a couple of close-up pictures with the camera still in the bucket, and noticed that there were water droplets in the picture!  Took the camera out of the water and there was water inside the front lens, with visible droplets on the inside surface of the lens! After a few minutes, the whole lens fogged up on the inside, making further pictures impossible.  Additional condensation appeared around the edges of the view screen.  I opened up the battery/memory card cover and there was water inside the camera.Before submerging the camera, I visually inspected the seal area on the access cover and everything looked OK.  I made sure the cover was closed and correctly latched.  After the test, knowing that the camera had leaked, I re-inspected the seal area as soon as I opened it, using an illuminated magnifier.  The seal still looked good, and I could not see anything in the seal area to cause a leak.Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in this camera, as I was really looking forward to taking some good snorkeling pictures.  Oh well, guess it's back to the old reliable 35mm waterproof cameras.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Underwater camera for the beginners", "Author": "YS Sheu \"ss\"", "ReviewID": "RQHQ0I7M5FZSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes exceptional pictures on land, and good pictures under the water (filters are needed to take better pictures).  I bought this camera for a trip to the Virgin Islands - I snorkeled at Buck island and took pictures of underwater creatures.  The camera works well under water, no leak and the battery lasts for a good 2 hours (continuous use).  It is little hard to take pictures under the water, because it was a very sunny day and I hardly could see anything on the screen because of the reflection.  But I guess all cameras have that kind of problem.  The zoom in function works great with this camera, which allows me to focus on the fish 15 feet deep while I was at the surface.  The camera automatically turns into underwater mode once it hits the water, so there is not a lot of learning to be done; it is pretty simple to use right out of the box.  As for the land picture, the quality of the picture is really fantastic.  I would buy this camera just for the fact that it is waterproof so that I would not need to worry about the rain.  I did purchase the orange float so that I won't lose my camera in the water.A lot of people complaint that this camera leaks.  Either they are getting a lemon or they didn't follow the instruction.  Any tiny fragment such as sand or dust or salt would prevent the waterproof door from closing properly.  So before changing battery or retrieving SD card, one must submerge the camera in fresh water for 10 minutes to wash off the salt or sand.  Also, one must replace the rubber seal every year to maintain waterproof integrity.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "DT \"dt\"", "ReviewID": "R38YUPOWU8KZR9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about buying this camera so I decided to buy it at a local Costco in case I needed to return it.  I have owned it for about 3 weeks and so far have had no problems.  We have taken it snorkeling about 10 times in Hawaii without any problems.  I even dove down about 15' to take some photos.Pros:Works well as a camera for snorkeling.Panorama mode is awesome.Controls are easy to use.  A separate button for video.Battery seems to last quite a while.GPS is very cool feature and it worked well.Has HDR modeCons:Seal is not user replaceable.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.Flash is pretty weak.Would have been nice to have a float lanyard with it.Other reviews I read that complained about no RAW and poor picture quality I think are making unfair comparisons.  This camera's biggest feature is it is waterproof.  If you aren't going to use it in the water you can get much better cameras for land use for the money.  I bought this for my wife.  I use a Canon S95 in an Ikelite housing with an external flash.  It takes better photos above and below the surface and can go below 100'.

The SD400 has been a great compact camera for the past 6+ years, but was getting long in the tooth esp since I bought a Windows 7 PC and couldn't get a driver (which created all kinds of issues with deleting subdirectories on the memory card).  The Kodak went back within a couple days of use because a) it didn't have an optical zoom and I found I really missed that, and b) the pictures were too 'contrasty' where the highlights were blown out and the shadows all clipped to black.  I guess for $80 the Kodak delivered its price-performance, but I only take pictures once and I want them to be good.  I also have a Canon SLR but I don't take that fly fishing, backpacking, winter camping, nor to the beach.I've only had the AW for about a week, but so far really enjoying it.  The image quality is as good as any Canon point-shoot (my wife has a newer Canon SD).  The menus are not quite as intuitive, and I had to spend a half day reading the 100 pg manual to really get a feel for how best to use this.  Still, there are a lot of flexible options including control over ISO and shake, and it has some cool modes that the Canon's don't have such as shooting 8 or 10 consecutive pics and auto-saving the least blurry to the memory card.  The 5x zoom is further augmented by a 5x digital zoom where the pixels are interpolated rather than cropping in.  I haven't tried the digital zoom yet, but I think this will be superior if/when I need that extra close up.I was also looking closely at the Panasonic Lumix but I chose the AW for superior video.  I really like the stereo sound it captures, and the slow-motion video shots have already been a lot of fun.  It allows you to record at 1/2 to 1/8 speed, or 2x speed, and you can even shift during the video shoot from normal speed to high or slow speed, and back.  The other thing I liked about the AW over the Lumix is the 5cm macro.  Have seen some stills on Youtube that looked pretty cool, and plan to try this out more now that I have a camera that can do it.I probably won't take this scuba diving since it's only good to 33 feet, but that's about my range for snorkeling and I'm sure it'll come in handy next time I'm someplace I'd rather be.  I'm also looking forward to shooting some underwater video of trout, and not having to wrap this in 3 ziplocks for a rainy day on the river (or just insurance against an unforeseen swimming opportunity).  Video'ing a buddy fighting a fish, toggling to slow-motion during a reel-screaming run and jump -- yep I think this will be a fun toy.Attaching a recent vid from the dog park, shot at 1/4 speed.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Kayaking", "Author": "C.

It must be charged using the supplied charger, which must be plugged into the wall. This brings up a related problem. It markets itself as an adventure camera and claims to be freeze proof yet it has lithium ion batteries, which drain like crazy when they get cold.

I kept it in my pocket and it was fine all day. However, I'm worried about what happens on multiday backcountry trips. How do I keep it charged? If I have an extra battery and it isn't in my pocket all day and night it is likely to drain. I can't take the charger unless I get the big huge GoPro solar panels with an inverter. Since it doesn't support USB charging I can't get a cheap AA battery pack that functions as a charger. In my opinion this is not a good multi-day camera due to the power supply.* Controls feel \"Trinkety\". The controls are plastic and feel like they were made from dime store plastic. It kind of makes the camera feel cheap. They do function OK.* Clunky controls and menus. The more you dive into the features and settings the more ridiculous it becomes. I'm the type of person who uses the controls and menus on a camera and I'd give the person who designed the menus and controls a C- grade. I guess they work, but for example it takes 3 clicks to delete a photo.* Boots up quickly. This is good because it is ready for action quickly. It's also good because there is no way to keep the camera \"on\" and have the display off.* Picture Review There is a mode to display the picture instantly after you take the shot but it only stays on the screen for like a second. On other cameras I liked the ability to select a longer auto display after the shot.* A class 6 SD memory card is recommended because you are recording HD movie. You'll probably want a 4GB or bigger card. Nikon only recommends SanDisk, Lexar, Panasonic and one other brand I'm forgetting.* The lens itself is covered by a piece of glass. The manual says it is possible that the internal glass surface might fog. They say \"this is not a defect\". The remedy they give is to go back to a place with a stable temperature, open the side door and see if it clears up. How am I supposed to do that in the backcountry? Fogging and condensation in the backcountry is due to extremes in temperature and moisture. I did not experience this when using the camera. I guess it is a pro and a con. It is easy to wipe off, but you are shooting through an additional surface which can pick up glare.* The camera is lightweight and compact* The action control navigation feature might actually be nice when you are wearing bulky gloves. I found it a little weird* Great Under water mode. I thought this might be its best feature. I was surprised at the quality of the photos and video it took under water. It might be cool to get the camera in the water as your buddy is reeling in a big fish on his fly rod. I took lots of pictures in rivers and tidepools and the ocean and it worked well. You can take it to 33 feet depth. I wish it were rated to go to double that for scuba diving.* Shock Resistant: I really like the idea that it is shock resistant. In the back country I tend to be hard on cameras. I have broken at least 3 because I dropped them or they were attached to a tripod that got bumped or blew over in the wind. I did not test or accidentally test this feature.Video ModeI was really disappointed in the video mode.* Banding was observed when shooting indoors and outdoors. There was also a lot of that phenomenon where you get a pixelated edge on your subject. The manual says this may occur in the presence of fluorescent and other types of lighting. I observied it outdoors in ideal lighting. It is very annoying and negates the purpose of having an HD camera. It also has problems with autofocus when the subject is moving.* High Speed Mode: I was intrigued by the ability to record HS video (with a fast frame rate of up to 240 fps. And thus enabling smooth slow motion playback). There are lots of times this would be nice. Like when a friend is doing a backflip off a waterfall into a pool of water. It works OK. The super slo mo 240 fps mode is in VGA and requires ideal lighting or it comes out dark. One cool feature they thought of is the ability to have the camera start regular speed filming and at the opportune moment when you want to capture slow motion you hit the \"ok\" button and it films in HS until you hit \"ok\" again and then it goes back to regular speed.* The zoom speed is fixed. Thus you can't do a slow zoom vs a fast zoom. I know this is not intended to be a motion studio quality camera, but just be aware of what you are getting. In general I'd describe the zoom as fast and abrupt. I didn't like this.* It has a small light (emphasis on small) that can help brighten the filming. I guess it is better than nothing.* Cuts Wind noise: It has a feature that cuts wind noise while filming. I tried it out and it seemed to help a little. In the backcountry on exposed ridges high wind is common.GPS ModeIt has very basic GPS functions. The controls are very clunky. Having it turned on sucks your battery. It does seem to pick up the satellites well. It's cool to have GPS data recorded in your pics.DigiscopingIf this camera had functioned well for digiscoping I would have kept it. It almost worked--it sort of worked. As expected with most cameras, vingetting was apparent when initially attached with a the Swarovski DCA adaptor. The vingetting did disappear when I zoomed all the way to the max optical range--5x and the scope was on it's lowest power-20x. Interestingly, the vignetting started when I cranked up the spotting scope power to around 45X. At 60X it was quite noticeable. I thought it was awesome that the camera comes with a 40.5mm adaptor that can be used with filters of that size. It clips on over the camera lens and I was able to get a step-up adaptor so it would fit on my 52mm spotting scope attachment. The autofocus at times seemed a little tripped out than other cameras I've used when digiscoping. It would blur in and out trying to figure out what I was shooting at. It did take excellent videos and photos when I had the scope on 20X and the camera zoomed to 5X. Because the camera is light it seemed to hang fine.Picture QualityI wasn't blown away with the consistency of the photo quality. To be sure it took some excellent photos, but then it would totally blow some other shots. I'll defer to other reviews on this.* 16 Megapixels means you can \"posterize\" your trip or even get shots for a magazine.* Panorama Mode: I was excited about this mode--but only half of it really worked. It has this \"easy panorama mode where you can just pan the camera and it will instantly create a panorama. I works OK at best. It sometimes leaves the stitches a little weird. It also has a manual stitch mode that works well.In summary I wanted to love this camera but in the end I think it only partially lived up to it's bill as an adventure camera. The problematic power supply issues, poor HD video quality, terrible controls, inconsistent photo quality, and less than ideal digiscoping functionality were not enought to outweigh the positives of underwater mode, and high mega pixels. I hope my discussion of the details will help other backcountry users know what they are getting into if they buy this. Unfortunately I feel like I don't know what else to turn to right now.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awsome Nikon AW100 (20111212) Update 20120801", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"NoClue-Really!\"", "ReviewID": "R3C049S108YUJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 20120801 -  Amazon would not allow a separate update for a similar product purchase so I have to update this review ...I just bought the replacement for the AW100 that rests on the bottom of the Pacific.  It is ORANGE (Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video (ORANGE)).I am not all that \"keen\" on Orange; however, the price was $40 less (now $268) than the original Black. It takes good pictures.  I say this because the original black unit would have difficulty sometimes taking a closeUp picture.  The \"new\" orange unit works near and far.  Now, I have to put it in water to make sure it is waterProof for its up-and-coming adventure.Oh, I have upgraded the AW100 to five (5) stars.  For several reasons:  1)  I bought another unit; 2) The orange works in my mix-and-notMatch world; 3) Maybe, just maybe, it will be easier to spot if it gets away from me; and, 4) It was $40 less expensive.I continue to recommend this product!***********************************************************20120322 ... The Nikon aw100 (BLACK) actually went to Hawaii as planned.  It took pictures on O'Ahu, and then on Hawai'i.  It was also supposed to be used on Maui.  It was a great camera.  It did almost 100% of what I thought it should.  It took surprising panorama shots.  It took amazing underwater pictures at the sea horse farm.  It took wonderful pictures in two lagoons while snorkling to approximate depths of 20 to 30 feet without any leakage.  It even got pictures of my spouse snorkling.  Then the camera did the most unspeakable thing.  It became a $400 \"disposable\" camera when it untethered itself and went to the bottom of the Pacific.  It was missed only when the Zodiac stopped in the third lagoon.It is a long shot to ask, \"If anyone locates the camera I would place no claim; however, I would greatly appreciate getting the 16gb SDHC card that has many pictures that can never be replaced.\"Now, for the next adventure where the \"camera\" will not run away?-------------------------------------------------------------20111212 ... For some reason I always need another camera.  The Nikon AW100 will fill a niche I have for something that can get dunked.  It will be a good companion to the Nikon S1000pj (the one that projects the image on a wall).Another important piece is that both the AW100 and the S1000pj use the same EN-EL12 battery.  Speaking of that, you just have to get the TWO EN-EL12 Replacement Battery (1050 mAh) + Battery Charger FOR Nikon CoolPix S1000pj / S610 / S610c / S620 / S630 / S640 / S70 / S710 / S8000 Digita ... offering here on Amazon.com since these two cameras can consume a lot of batteryJuice!  I got four (4) units of the above mentioned charger and got eight (8) EN-EL12 batteries as well as four car adapters and four wall chargers for under $35 TOTAL - \"Oh, and they work, too!\" which really surprised me.There is a lot about the AW100 I have not used.  My first curiosity was the battery.  I just wanted to see what the maximum burn might be.  I turned on all options (at maximum) and tinkered with everything to use as much batteryJuice as I could.  The result was something like 76 pictures - \"Acceptable\" to me.I inserted a Transcend 32 GB Class SDHC 10 Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10E into the AW100.  4,000 plus pictures at maximum resolution for under $40.The GPS.  Seem to sensitive enough to work inside most buildings even where DeLorme and Garmin GPS units cannot get signal.  The map is very general and is really useful, for me, for GeoCaching.  To get the coordinates from the jpg image requires Photoshop or other software that can access this meta data.  One curiosity is the possible map updates.  This feature shows in the menu; however, so far I have not been able to find out much more about it.The Compass.  The neighbors thought I was a little confused/touched as I stood in my front yard waiving this small black object in a figure-eight motion as the snow fell around me.  For some reason I felt that I needed to be able to get a good compassReading in my yard in the snow to learn how well the \"first\" pictures might look (BTW, they looked good if I might say so!).The Lens position.  The position of the lens is where one can take marvelous pictures of parts of one's fingers.  I have a whole set of them that I might put on display in a gallery?The Camera with Heart.  The AW100 has numerous settings.  When you get the camera you will see this icon (camera with heart) on the screen.  It basicially means the camera will take a picture - results are mostly surprisingly good.The Camera without Heart.  I mostly use this setting.The Panorama (sp?).  It is most curious.  I am more accustomed to the larger images available in the Sony A900 and the like that are stitched using something like Photoshop.  The AW100 does a grand job of creating a panorama.  Now, the camera is a little to smart AND you have to do the way the developers intended which I remain a little uncertain about the 360-deg version.  I have gotten insulted using the 180-deg version by being informed I am not doing it right.  You can only go in one direction with either horizontal or vertical movement - BUT, not both.  The end result when I do the right thing is a strip photo that seems a whole lot better than I thought that I would get.Up Close.  I like microPhotography.  This camera does a good job.Low Light.  I am not certain that the camera was responsible, more so than the operator, when taking low light photographs.  The camera seemed to have a difficult time focusing even with the assist light that is built into the camera for these situations.Light Assist.  This is an annoying light that is disruptive because I have not found the setting to keep it extinguished when I do not want it startling the photoObject or announcing that a photograph will be taken.Opening the Housing.  The battery, SD card, USB and HDMI connectors are located behind a door that is sorta a mess for big fingers to open since the button on the top must be pressed and then a counterClockwise turn must be done to get the door open.  The space is \"real\" tight and I did find that some SDHC cards were not all that easy to extract or to determine if properly seated.  If this happens, just remove the battery and it is easier to slip a fingerNail into the SD card crease for extraction.Menu.  The menu is not the best Nikon has offered.  I have finally located most of the features I think should be available.  Some I am still seeking.Documentation.  The userGuide and userManual are a poorExcuse and an exercise in futility.  They follow the typical mentality of \"trial and mistake\" to learn how to meaningfully use the camera features.Waterproof.  I was going to take the camera into the bathtub to do some underWater shooting of a rubberDucky.  I was advised that this was offensive to the rubberDucky and possibly illegal and probably an issue of privacy so I will have to wait until I am in the ocean.Strap.  It really makes no sense to include a nonWaterProof strap with a camera that is to be used underwater.  I do not have time to get a waterProof strap so I will have to makeDo with some fishingLine.  Oh yes, there was as sorta piece-of-string that was supposed to be used with the camera in the water.  I really need a strap that can just stay connected to the camera so when I fall out-of-the-boat I do not have to spend a whole lot of time trying to change to the waterProofStrap before I hit the water (\"Oh yea, where, in this instance do I put the nonWaterProof strap?).Pictures.  The camera takes great pictures in a snow setting where other cameras straight-out-of-the-box fail.  Night photographs are a little iffy.  In-the-water pictures have not been tried, yet!Zoom.  It also has digital zoom.  I find, as with most digital zoom, it adds more noise to the picture than the implied benefit from the apparentCloseness provided by the inCamera crop.  It might be okay for those that do not have something like Photoshop.  The lens zoom was adequate and allowed me to capture deer in the snow at some 100 yards that will, of course, need Photoshop.Slideshow.  I am using slideShow two ways.  The first is to display the individual pictures that have been collected on the SD card.  It works okay.  I usually do not use a camera for this purpose.  I would much rather shoot pictures and then get back to the 27\" colorCorrected monitor and photoshop at some later time.  The second part of the slideShow is used with panoramas.  In this case, the picture is moved smoothly across the entire vista of the scene.  A bit impressive but lacks the usefulness of portability to be able to share with friends.Buttons.  Like buttons on anything small if big fingers are involved.  \"Ya just has to deal with it!\"Overall Impression.  The Nikon AW100 hasn't leaked yet (of course not, I have not put it into the water).  It has taken an assortment of pictures that I think exercise its capabilities.  I am impressed.  So, let's learn how well it does underwater.

I always felt the average person is a far better judge of a product than a business is (except consumer reports of course).  I took this camera on it's first use during a Caribbean 7-day cruise.  With constant pictures (max size / quality), average amount of flashes used, and HD video repeatedly being taken; I averaged two batteries per day - starting around 7am and recording / picturing up until 11pm daily.  The second battery was about 1/4 left by 11pm.For underwater use - the quality was unbelievable.  I took it on a couple snorkeling dives and had it recording (HD Video on underwater mode) before jumping into the water.  Shock-absorbing quality was awesome as it got a very hard workout during the dives, jumping, and knocking around.  The video recording excellent sound in and out of water without the out-of-water sound being distorted at all (no shaking needed to clear anything out).  Waterproofing held up to 30 feet diving and not a single drop was seen inside during anytime I swapped out batteries or memory cards.  Nighttime video was always very good still during the multiple stage shows and trips around the ship.Picture taking was quick and not delayed heavy as with previous CoolPix models that I have used.  Power-up was also quick and made it very easy to use this camera when a picture was needed right now and not 15 seconds from now.I've used the camera a great deal since the cruise (couple months ago now) and still not a single problem has occurred.I am VERY happy with this camera and couldn't believe it actually turned out to be as good as the product description led itself out to be!", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good little water camera", "Author": "MonicaMole", "ReviewID": "R37EJ0YLCVB7IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got is for my husband as an early Christmas present, we were going to Roatan (Bay Islands,Honduras) and we got great underwater pictures as well as sunsets, people and the last day there, under an awful storm, we got some great video and including the wind effect!

I played with high ISO shots, and then I played with Lumix TS3, and the Sony TX10; I think it's embarassing when generic electronic companies do better than the photo-dedicated giant like Nikon (and all the backlit-cmos mumbo-jumbo is not helping out).  Aside from better high-iso shots from sony and panny, the lens actually opens up a little more on sony and panasonic (f/3.5, and f/3.3, respectively), whereas on the Nikon it's f/3.9 (even this little bit makes quite a bit of difference in the dark).  And both Sony and Panasonic feel more responsive, when focusing and taking a picture...  There are many cons and pros to all these cameras, but the Nikon consistently looses out on the actual ability to take pictures.  The focus is softer than on the other cameras, and the jpg's have this \"smudgy\" overprocessed look.  It's an OK camera with GREAT specs; but, after playing with the competition, I don't consider the Nikon's bringing to the table a worthwhile competitor.  Interestingly, Canon is also not participating in this waterproof camera game (effectively).  I ended up going with Sony for its smaller size, even though I'm not a fan of the touchscreen.  Panasonic is also a VERY GOOD alternative.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera for Outdoor Use", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R1YOH7KN6GU0IN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a few days now and have been very impressed with the tests I've put it through thus far.  This camera does everything Nikon says it will and does them all wonderfully.Overall BuildThis is a small camera in your hands which is a good and bad thing.  It's great because it means it's easy to slip in your pants or shirt pocket and always keep with you.  It weighs little enough that you hardly notice it's there.  I see where some people could see this as an issue because the buttons on it are very small in order to have the back LCD as large as possible.  It does not feel cheap even though it's made out of plastic and although I don't plan on doing a drop test, I am confident it would survive a drop from chest high.Picture QualityWith an 8GB SD card I don't see a reason to shoot at any other setting than the highest resolution, so all my playing around with it was done at this setting.  The JPEGs that come out look great.  The images are sharp, have good color and the auto whitebalance has done an amazing job.  The main thing I was worried about was having to do difficult WB corrections after the fact if it wasn't right on with the WB, but so far it has been spot on in full sun shots, shady shots, indoor with incandescent and indoor with fluorescent lights.  I honestly think the 16MP is a little overkill, but will keep shooting at full resolution as I don't know when I'll need those extra pixels.  Lastly, low light shooting has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I thought with a sensor as small as this one there would be lots of noise in the final result but even at the higher ISO levels the pictures are very clear and useable.VideoI don't really plan on using this for video too much but have tested it out nonetheless.  It is very smooth while shooting at 1080p and looks great when run to my TV to view it.  The microphones pick up the noises very well and even have a setting that reduces wind noise (I tested by blowing on the microphone while recording).  To shoot video you don't have to change modes or anything - you just press the red circle button on the back and you're off.Button Placement/MenuEverything seems to get in the right place as far as buttons go.  Most can be reached with either your right thumb or right index finger while you're holding it up to shoot without adjusting, although if you are a lefty you will need to get used to holding it in your right hand.  I also shoot a Nikon d5100 and had no trouble figuring out what everything did without looking at the instruction manual, so if you've used a Nikon in the past few years this should be a breeze.  The menu is fairly uncomplicated and not overloaded with useless features.  It is quick to get to the setting I want without too many annoying clicks.  This is important to me as I had missing shots while I fumble with the buttons.Vibration ReductionI tested this out by holding the camera at arms length with one hand while shooting some test shots.  Even from the LCD I could tell the image was doing a lot less shaking than my hand was, and was very impressed by the pictures when they came out.  This will definitely come in handy on the boat.Auto-FocusHaving not used a point and shoot in a few year, I was very pleased with how far the autofocus has come.  It quickly locks on to an object, highlights the object and will keep it in focus even if you start swinging the camera around.  Going from objects ~1 foot away to 30 feet away has been focused quickly and accurately.  No complaints here.Water-ProofnessThe main reason I got this camera is so I could take it out with me when I go fishing.  This means the first chance I got, I took this camera in a pool to start testing it out.  It worked as expected, shooting at the 10 foot deep end of the pool with no problem.  The color correction for shooting underwater was also quite effective.  After taking some test shots, I put the camera in my pocket for the rest of the time in the pool just to keep it submerged for as long as possible.  After a quick towel off out of the pool, it looked good as new.  The battery/SD card door has a foolproof way of shutting and remaining watertight so unless I puncture something I'm not worried about water getting in there.GPSI have loved the performance of the GPS even when indoors.  This is something that will be very useful when I either go fishing or go out in the woods and want to take a picture of something that is in a location I want to come back to.  The GPS data is written to the metadata so I can punch it in googlemaps after I get home to see where things were.  It also has an electronic compass which is handy for a few reasons and has worked great so far.FlashIt works and it lights things up.  I've sort of grown to love to hate flashes for snapshot while using my dSLR so I try not to use it often.  It is significantly better than some of the old point and shoots I've used, so in a pinch I will rely on it.Battery LifeDon't let the tiny battery fool you - it lasts a long time.  After the initial charge, I've spent close to an hour just going through all the menus playing with things, testing out the GPS, taking dozens of pictures and videos and reviewing them on the camera after the fact and am still above 50%.  I couldn't imagine a situation where I would feel the need to purchase or bring a second battery along unless I was going to be out of civilization for a week or so.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an outdoor/waterproof camera, or someone who needs a slightly more durable camera due to butterfingers.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "best tough camera", "Author": "ckinser", "ReviewID": "R1CN5QL9ST8U05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this camera last week, It takes great pictures even when there is not much light.

No problems there.*Waterproof - Fortunately, I never had any of the water intrusion problems so many other reviewers had. I used it in pouring rain, while soaking in some hot springs and I did swim with it, but did not dive. I'd say the max depth my camera experienced is shallower than 6 feet.*GPS - Love this feature. The GPS seemed to be very accurate, almost a little too picky about being accurate as I touch on in the dislikes section below. I love having my pictures tagged with location data and consider this a valuable feature.*Compass - Very nice to have. Kept me from getting lost a couple of times when I needed a general idea of direction. The camera also tags the photo with compass data, so you get to see where the camera was pointing when the picture was taken.*Video - HD video is nice.*Quick startup - I was impressed with the time it took to power up and take the first picture. It's a shame about that second one though. (see below)Dislikes:*Lens fogs up nearly *EVERY TIME* I pull it out to take pictures - This is my number one frustration. Yes, I know Nikon has something to say about this. Sitting on the top of Mt. St. Helens getting pummeled by wind and blowing snow while waiting 15 min for the camera to (maybe!) decide to un-fog while is no fun at all. Getting wildlife to cooperate and wait for my camera to be ready doesn't work very well. Sunsets/sunrises don't stay put either. Simply, this is an unacceptable drawback.*Poor image quality - Taking pictures at 16MP was pointless because of all the lens fogging, sensor / JPEG noise, poor autofocus, lens smudges etc. My iPhone took better pictures.*Autofocus was inconsistent - I could never trust it to get an in-focus picture the first time. Always remember rule #2 from the movie Zombieland: Double-tap.*2nd picture was slow - Speaking of double-tap. It was frustrating that it would take a second or two to take the next picture. Despite using a class 10 card.*Horrible battery life - I could hope that the battery lasted about a day's use. Yes, I used it with the GPS and compass on nearly all the time. No, I don't want to turn it off, the GPS is my one of my favorite features and a major reason I picked this camera. I think it would be helpful if the screen's backlight would go dark after some time of being idle. A larger battery would help more.*Charger unsuitable for travel - The size of the charger itself wasn't too bad. The bad part is that it comes with this 6ft cord. Combined with the terrible battery life, this is a larger drawback than it would be for other cameras.*USB cable - Speaking of dumb cords. This camera uses a different type USB cable. So you'll be bringing along yet another cable if you want to retrieve the pictures from the camera. Also, the camera can't charge via this port.*Slow GPS - If the camera was powered on say, 50 miles from its last known location, acquiring an new position took FOREVER. Meanwhile, the screen's backlight would be going full blast and the battery would be running down.*Picky GPS - If I had a locked-in position, then stepped below something that blocked the signal for 2 seconds, it would decide not to tag my photos with location. C'mon guys, I didn't move that far in a couple of seconds.*No orientation sensor - Hope you like rotating your photos 90deg in post.*No lens cover - Lens would get smudged in my pocket. I was always wiping the lens whenever I had something clean and dry to wipe with. Due to the nature of my trips, I frequently didn't have anything clean/dry, so I was stuck with lots of poor photos as a result. A friend's old waterproof Olympus had a retracting lens protector. It would be nice to have something like that, but I imagine there are durability trade offs.*Action Control frustrations - I could never get this to work in a way that I could predict and the camera would just decide to do random stuff. Also, there was no way to turn it off for picture viewing, so the camera would usually switch to a different photo when I handed the camera to another person.In conclusion, the things I like about this camera don't have anything to do with being a camera and I dislike all the camera-like attributes. When compared to my old Canon SD770 that it was to replace, it falls down in every category except durability and video.

You'll be lucky to get more than an hour or two out of one charge with average to heavy use with maps, GPS and the compass features turned on. Second, focus is terrible. This thing takes forever to focus and often fires off before it achieves anything but a blur. For a camera meant for the outdoors, it craps out on a pretty important aspect of a point and shoot: reliable focus on anything but landscapes.

The camera showed signs of malfunctioning immediately in the water when each time I turned it vertically the screen would black out; it would only show an image if the camera was held horizontally.  I'm not sure if that's a settings issue or not, but that never happened when I took pictures vertically outside of the water.

Are you kidding me?  That's a ridiculous amount of money to spend when there are other waterproof cameras currently on the market that have better reviews and cost around $150!  It's absolutely insulting that Nikon would try to gouge their customers with exorbitant repair rates when the camera clearly did not function as advertised.

The pictures were there during the day, and the first time we reviewed them, they were all there, but then when my wife went to point out some of the pictures she took later that evening, only 2 of the 40 or so that were taken during the tour were still there.  I had to use file recovery software when I got home from the trip to recover them.  After losing all of those pictures, we bought a new memory card to make sure that the pictures, if they were still there, wouldn't be overwritten by the camera later in our trip.  The pictures taken were great, so I was willing to overlook the lost pictures, assuming the memory card might be bad, it is a couple of years old.

I spent 14 days snorkeling, and 1 day scuba diving (to 25 ft), and took the camera with me all of those times. I also had it in the water taking pictures of surfers and kiteboarders, so in all, the camera was in the water about 20 days. It takes great pictures and has a mind-boggling array of features if one is inclined to use them, but it takes really good pictures just on the auto setting. I did use the underwater setting all the times I used it underwater. The main problem I had with the camera was that it did fog up inside the lens when I changed locations - primarily from shade to hot sun. The first time this happened I was in a very dry area and opened the case, it only took about 3 minutes to loose the fog. The other times is was near or in the water - all high humidity areas - and did not open the case. These times it took longer, 10-15min to loose the fog. Being in a very high humidity area it would have been difficult to avoid any moisture inside the camera, but this is my only complaint about the camera. In the future I think I will bring a silicone packet to put in the camera when the battery is charging to get rid of internal moisture. I was very careful to soak the camera in fresh water after each saltwater day, as well as to keep the seal area clean.

However, I've found it wise to take more shots than you need, because it can also lose focus, over-expose, etc.  Maybe 20% of the shots are sketchy (in auto mode) - which is probably more or less in line with phone cameras and other mid-level point-n-shoots.The interface and settings menus are generally easy to navigate.  I think many of these point-n-shoot cameras have tried to cram in so many functions that at times navigating the menus is a bit quirky, but I've kept it mostly in Automatic settings so I can't say I've probed too deeply on all the functions (using my DSLR for more advanced photography).I was actually surprised at how good the video worked.

I wanted this for a vacation I was taking to the Bahamas since I planned on going snorkeling. I ordered it really close to the day of departure so I was crossing my fingers that on my test it was no defective. I submerged it in my bathtub and took pictures of things and it worked great. I let it dry and powered it on again the next morning to make sure it was functional. My concern was salt water so I was uneasy still. I took it out in the waters of the Bahamas took videos and pictures in the water and it worked great. video was incredible and pictures were as well. I submerged it as the directions state in water to rinse it took it out and let it dry. I powered it on the next day and it worked great. I am thinking some people may have issue because the seal for the battery is very fragile as the directions state. The suggest opening the door and holding it upside down so any particles such as sand or whatever do not stay in the seal. If you close the air tight seal with an obstruction then water can seep in. Design flaw? no just reality. Make sure you do not close anything in the seal such as camera strap or sand and the seal should not be damaged. as a precaution I have affixed my camera strap to the opposite side of the door to avoid such a mishap. Anyways its a great product and I have yet to have any issues. To the people who are saying it takes crap pictures underwater I say this. Murky waters will not take awesome pictures. I have used underwater surveillance equipment in waters that are dirty and even with intense lights designed to offset murky waters you still cant see anything so make sure a) your camera is set to underwater mode and b) make sure your not in dirty water.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nearly perfect adventure camera", "Author": "Steve H", "ReviewID": "R3CFL4CB4TIRQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nikon AW100 after researching the waterproof pocket size offerings of the dominant manufacturers who have similar cameras.  Through the reviews found online, and comparing the specifications, the Nikon seemed a bit too good to be true.  It was spec'd to have higher resolution than the rest (16MP), better zoom (only 5X, but better than 3X or 4X of competitors), and it is lighter.  I was a little concerned with the $300 price tag, but I figure the waterproof capability alone saves me from destroying cameras or having to deal with dry bags/boxes to protect fragile equipment is well worth the investment.When I received the camera, I dug in and checked out all the accessories.  The reason I call it a \"near perfect\" camera is because you have to remove the battery to charge it.  If you could recharge it through the USB cable that is used to offload the photos, I would definitely remove the \"nearly\".  The charger included only works on AC power, so if you are on a long adventure, you will either need an aftermarket charger that works on 12VDC, or USB, or make sure you have plenty of extra batteries to get you through.  I found that a battery will last through an active day of taking photos and videos, so I would recommend one battery per day with an extra if you are a real shutterbug  If you aren't constantly turning it on and off and snapping shots, you can obviously get by with less.  It remains to be seen if there is a loss of capacity in the Li-ion batteries as they age.  Typically this cell chemistry does well over time.Right out of the box, I got the battery charged and installed it, and couldn't wait to get it wet.  I turned it on, and filled up a large tumbler with water and plunged it in.  After all, if it is going to fail on me, I want it to happen at home, not out on the trail when I am depending upon it to capture the memories of a lifetime.  I let it soak for a little while and was comfortable that this little gem was definitely at least splash proof.  That weekend, I went out kayak fishing offshore with some friends.  I was still learning how to use many of the functions, so I accidentally left it on several times, and other rookie mistakes, but it held up perfectly and I got some good photos and video of fish being caught and released.A couple weeks later, the reason I made this purchase came up and I headed for Montana.  I learned more about the functions and the panorama function was again worth the cost of the camera.  When you are in the midst of enormous vistas that you have no idea how to capture, this mode is the best way to try to show your friends what you experienced.  This camera takes fantastic panorama shots that capture mountain views better than I have ever pieced together in Photoshop.  One click of the button and pan 180 or 360 degrees and you get the whole thing holding the camera landscape or portriat.The macro mode is also very good.  I took many photos of wildflowers, of which, the ones where I remembered the macro mode, turned out fabulous.  I also took some great shots of a flyfishing lure in front of a sunrise that look like postcards.  Having the camera halfway submerged is the only way to get the angle and the sharpness that I achieved.  Knowinig a few basics about how to frame a photo and a good camera that figures out all the little details while protecting itself from the elements makes for some amazing memories to share with friends and family.Some of the mountain lakes filled with fish were a great opportunity to video some of them swimming around.  I started the video, and sank the camera into the icy water and followed the fish for some HD video that is hard to beat by National Geographic.  The camera handled everything without a hitch.  It was even blown off a rock a couple times while I was trying to take a self portriat using a small tripod.  A four foot tumble down a boulder into the rocks didn't even scratch it.This is a tough camera, for those who need a waterproof camera that is light, reliable, and easy to use.  It is the point and shoot that you have been dreaming of.Get out there!", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressed but couple of flaws", "Author": "Anthony E Hornak", "ReviewID": "R2SYTLPPPT7P98", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few months ago and take it with me everywhere.  I love using it and I love the comfort factor that I can hand it to my kids to use without having to hoover over them.  For me the Pro's outweigh the Cons.  This camera is loads of fun.Cons:- BIG CON:  Owner manual states to replace the seal on the door annually.  I am ok with this but when I called Nikon to find out how much the annual maintenance would cost me they told me I had to mail the camera in for an estimate, hmm. They would NOT give me a price over the phone nor was I allowed to contact the place in New York where my camera would be shipped to for work. Everything would have to be done by mail. Why would a company who mass manufactures a product not know how much the seal/part cost and how much labor is required to perform a periodic maintenance that they themselves outlines as necessary?  Secondly, why would they expect their customer to mail their AW100 camera in to an unknown facility; that the consumer is not allowed to contact or speak with; to later have an \"estimate\" mailed to them of work the mysterious people deemed necessary when your camera was working just fine to begin with.  3 stars for this alone.- Is not fog resistance.  Guess you can't have everything- Performance is poor indoors/low light settings- When using the Flash the camera can take a few extra seconds to refresh.  Not to be exact but I have seen ~5sec; could have been due to low battery.- I may need to mess with the setting a bit more but I do happen to get blurry pics when trying to catch my kids in motion.  Auto focus lags when within a few feet range ie: 22ft - 6ft or so to give an example/not exact.- Video mode the auto focus is non-existent when zooming in.Pros:- This is an OUTDOOR camera.  Taking pics outdoors is where it thrives. =D This is why I carry it everywhere with me because the pictures do come out very beautifully.- Zoom is acceptable for fix lenses.- Slow mode camera setting - very cool. Don't have a use for it yet but still cool.-  Battery life is descent - last all day.  Going to buy a spare battery just because I constantly used the camera and video mode definitely takes more juice. Love my videos.- Nice design - very compact and sleek.- Video mode is cool out of the water and in the water.  Love it.Suggestion:- If you like going out in the water a lot whether at the beach, lake, on a boat buy a floating device for your camera.  I have one. It is easy to take off.- IMPORTANT: When not in use OPEN up the battery door - the seal is made of rubber and even though it is a \"rugged\" camera it needs a little TLC.  To ensure a good seal you need to allow the rubber to expand every once in a while instead of that yellow seal always staying compress when the door is closed.- Since the seal is rubber make sure it does not dry out.  If it is looking like it might - treat it.- Place/buy scratch resistance screen protector for the back of the camera.- Also makes sure that the smallest granule of dirt is not between the seal and the camera before closing the battery door. Bad voodoo.Food for Thought:- I have bought some UV filters and a Macro lens for the camera.  I will let you know how it goes but they are available.- Need to figure out how to get the water to fully bead off of the lens.  Didn't have the issue till recently.  I have found it hard to take pics with water spots blocking the image I am trying to capture and usually I am all wet so I do not have anything \"dry\" to wipe the lens - catch 22.

I just completed a 5K mudrun with this camera looped around my shoulder. I swam through mud, ran over obstacles, ran in 95 degree weather and it survived with amazing video and images. In fact, it was completely covered in mud that I was unable to clear the lens half way through the race, rendering it useless. After the race I doused it with a water bottle and took a few more quality shots. When I arrived home I washed it in the sink, let it dry and cracked the memory card compartment open. It was like brand new. Data transferred perfectly and been checking it the last few days for operation and it is still working perfectly.I 100% recommend this product. It won't replace a DSLR, but for extreme memories this is it. I opted for this camera over a go pro for more useability. It has the standard tripod screw hole on the bottom and I've looked up some decent camera mounts for it, so they're available. And, it's a terrific point and shoot with many features.Tip: Learn how to use the camera. If your pictures or videos are not coming out the way you want then there is a setting you are missing. If you haven't drained the battery at least through two full charges playing with all the features and settings and read the manual, then you're going to miss your shot.The macro setting is amazing.

The battery was fully charged prior to my using in the camera.  It was being used by someone when it inexplicably warned onscreen something about \"Battery\" before turning itself off.  The battery shouldn't have been dead as the thing wasn't even powered on but a few minutes throughout the day.  That said, it wouldn't do anything when plugged in to charge.  After going back to the local store where I'd bought it, hassling the electronics department to let me try their floor model battery just to see if it was the battery and not the unit, turned out it was the battery.  OK, so since the store wasn't about to let me swap batteries I go on amazon and order 2 replacements with some nifty external charger for like $20.  No issues there, and I'm happy again.  Fast forward a week and I'm out snorkeling with my Coolpix aw100 that according to the description on this page \"Dive into 33 feet of water\".  Wrong.  I was down about 15 feet in saltwater, and to be generous lets round that up to 20 even 25 feet.  Still almost 10 feet above the threshold at 25 feet, and I assure you it wasn't 25 feet deep.  Picture how long it takes to swim 5-10 feet down, and without a scuba tank picture at most DOUBLING that distance.  Unless you are a real professional, you're not going to leisurely be 25 feet underwater without a pretty decent effort.  Nevermind 33 feet.  Point being, I'm on the surface trying to figure out why the camera won't turn on and can see the LCD covered with water droplets/fog on the inside.  The battery door was securely closed so it wasn't user error, and I know it was closed because upon opening I watched water pour out and see the battery expanding inside about to explode.  I assume the saltwater neutralized the battery so it probably wouldn't have done so but in any event, there's my story.  I'm out $300-something on a camera, $20 on a pair of batteries, and $65 on the 64gb microsd card I bought that is essentially useless as well.  To get what few photos I could salvage off that microsd, I had to run a recovery software on my computer and essentially play detective for hours on end until I was able to successfully save the pictures.

I bought this for a more portable solution than my Nikon DSLR and because it is waterproof (we were about to go on vacation to Cabo San Lucas). The picture quality is good, not as good as my DSLR--though that's to be expected--but a thousand times better than a Samsung camera that I returned a month before buying this model.There's a few things I wish it had:1) I have found in more than one place (even Nikon's website) that this camera has wifi. It does not. It has GPS, but it most definitely does not have wifi or bluetooth. That's too bad.2) Why, dear Nikon, must you force yet another battery type and cable connector on us? I'm sure the data transfer off this camera could be handled by a mini or micro USB, but no, Nikon had to go and make a dedicated cable. Grr.3) Modes: there's an Easy Auto and a Auto mode. Using the camera for a few months, I still can't tell the difference.4) Battery life is poor. I know Nikon can make a battery with tons of life. My DSLR battery lasts for weeks and hundreds of shots. Granted, it's bigger, but I think my expectations that PnS should last at least half as long are realistic.5) Battery: when it goes, it goes. One moment you'll look at the charge indicator and it will be full. The next minute, dead. This one makes me nuts. I recently returned from a trip to Mexico City. The battery, appearing fully charged, went from full to insufficient in about 4 shots. For the remainder of the day I took less quality pictures with my cell phone. This problem really irks me as it can leave one with a \"brick\" instead of the camera they wish they had to take decent pictures!6) The pictures are a little dull. The color range seems off and a little bit unrealistic. It's not a show stopper, but I find I have to post processing to make the pictures look more realistic. Typically a contrast adjustment is an absolute must.i was a little hard in this review for a 4-star review. I should point out that it is a nice, rugged little unit that I've fallen into the Pacific Ocean with and it has survived. In fact, it seems to work best when it's under water!

The  retailer that I bought the camera from immediately exchanged the camera for another refurbished unit when I contacted them. No complaints whatsoever with them.

I asked if there was any possibility of being reimbursed for the recovery of the files or if I could upgrade the replacement refurb unit for a new camera.

This is my second NIKON underwater camera and this one is superior to others I have experienced.  It took good videos and excellent photos underwater.  There is a setting for underwater photography and if this is used it facilitates the rationing of light appropriately.  If it is not used, there is some photoshopping needed to highlight some darker photos.  This camera is steady and avoids the typical unclear or blurry photos that often occur when the camera is moved constantly.  My son took at least 7 lengthy videos underwater and fish and other objects are clear.  Photos are also clear and reproducable.On occasion I set the exposure compensation lighter to see how that faired.  It was okay but needed to be changed back when photos were taken on dry land.  If not, the photos will be light and washed out.  The settings on this camera are easy to use for me because I am comfortable with NIKON's methods for menus and toggling.  I have other NIKONs which are much more elaborate but use similar methods on the menu.  I did not use strap included with the camera because it was not recommended for use in the water.  I did use the thin one also included which fit around a wrist and could be tightened so it wouldn't slip off underwater.  Because of the excellent photos, I carry this as an additional camera to my D80 and D7000.  The only reason I didn't give this camera 5 stars is because I have not used it underwater myself and will reserve judgement until I do.  I am pleased with the videos and photos that my son took.Considering the use and my needs, this camera is more than satisfactory.

My last camera was the Nikon Coolpix S8100.  That took incredible pictures but I always took it fishing and to the beach and sand got in the telescope lens and eventually it malfunctioned.  Considering that I decided I'd definitely stick with Nikon and try the AW100 so I can take it anywhere.  Here is what I've found:Pros:-Fairly small and compact.  Easy to whip out and take a picture.-Great selection of colors (although I recommend not getting camo if you plan on taking this into to woods for obvious reasons).-Although I have limited underwater use, the ones I did take looked pretty good.-Seems fairly durable so far.  Its taken a couple drops from four feet on a tennis court and held up (although video that had been recording is lost when it is dropped as the camera turns off).Cons:-Battery Life.  You need more than one battery especially on trips where you will be taking videos.-Charger.  You can't charge the battery in the camera.  This is a must for \"all weather\" cameras.  It at least should include a travel charger with a car charger or USB connection so you can charge it on the go.  With this camera all that's included is an external battery charger that requires an outlet.  This is a big downfall to this camera.-Images.  Although this camera takes some very good pictures, occasionally it will take ones out of focus. The same thing happened a couple times with videos.  Never had this happen with my previous Nikon S8100. I find I'm not as confident when I need to take a \"must have\" picture with this camera on the go.-Color. I got the Camo color because it was much cheaper on amazon than any of the other colors.  If you really plan to use this outdoors though, I'd get orange or blue but you will pay more.-Video.  Video is average to above average but the problem with it is when the camera falls the camera turns off and you lose all video you had been taking.  I took about a half hours worth of tennis video.  It took about a four foot fall and hit the court.  The camera itself was fine afterwards but it had turned off and the video was gone after the fall.  That was a bit disappointing.  Maybe I had too much confidence in its advertised \"shock proofness\" though. I did contact customer service to ask them if this was normal and they said after a 4 foot fall I would \"have issues\".  That's all they said.-Customer Service.  I really would have liked more than a short answer as to why an \"all weather\" camera does the above when its advertised as being \"shock proof\" but it is what it is.Overall: Decent camera but a step down for Nikon.  Image quality is a step down from regular cameras but that was to be expected as the lens in enclosed.  Randomly taking poor quality blurry pictures doesn't help my confidence though as I never had this happe with my previous Nikon's.  I haven't decided whether to take this one back or not.  I would take a good hard look at others before buying this one.  The battery charger is a huge issue as well with this camera for anybody that needs to charge on the run.

Even though there are smaller cameras out there, it is small enough to always toss in a pocket and have along. I really enjoy having the ability to not worry about the weather or location for using it. No problem going into the pool or other shallow water. (haven't tested deeper water to its rating). The water tight nature does produce an interesting side effect though. I was in humid summer weather at 400m then took a gondola up to a much cooler and higher 1800m mountain top. When there, the moisture from the air below condensed on the inside of the lens. By opening up the hatch and leaving it in the sun for a few minutes it cleared, but it probably wouldn't have happened with a 'leaky' camera.Picture quality can be stunning. Sharp, good colors, excellent low light performance. It is a PHD camera though so it can get faked out and produce mediocre pics too. But not often. I have a Canon EOS and iPhone 4 available for pictures and find myself using this one as my preferred option the majority of the time. iPhone picture quality can be similar but over a much lower range of challenges and only has a wide angle lens instead of zoom. Combine this with the ergonomics of shooting and the risk of loss and the AW100 wins out for anything other than an opportunistic snapshot.  The older Canon Rebel XT has even better optics and sensor so produces better pictures and shoots/resets instantly but involves dragging a large camera around (and can't take video) The Nikon fits right in the middle. And the AW100 turns on and shoots almost instantly which is great.I only have two real 'dings':1) The battery situation. Lifespan is adequate but not stunning. But the real problem is that the on screen indicator will show 'full' until it jumps to 'low' at which time you are about to die. The best answer is to pick up a spare battery and rotate them. Otherwise you WILL find yourself empty when you want to take a picture.  You can buy a little more time by turning off the GPS, but that's one of the cool things anyway of having the pictures geo coded automatically.2) GPS lock in time and indications. Sometimes it will lock in almost instantly (even indoors or in the city) and other times (in clear, outdoor space) it can take forever (hate to just leave camera on all the time due to #1) I have found this inconsistency even when I side load the assist file recently.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Glad i went with this one", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R15HO1440YH8OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time reading all the reviews watching the you-tube video's etc to pick the best waterproof camera for my wife's birthday.

The response time with lower light can begin to get longer as well.Overall a fantastic camera for the price and a great way to have both a point and shoot and an underwater camera!", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Leakage problem", "Author": "djee", "ReviewID": "R2I624JRDHL110", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this camera for a little over 2 months.

Camera produced very good images, a decent shutter lag, no leaking or funky things electronically.  HD was very good, had decent audio pick up as well.  I normally shoot DSLRs, D300 and D3S, so of course, for a small camera, you really can't compare to a larger sensor with that kind of pixel base, even if this is a 16MP camera.  But the colors are pretty true to life, you just can't crop too much.  I've used this camera out in sunlight, in the water, at night with fireworks, in a muddy lake, in fact, I lost it for about 10 minutes submerged in mud when my kayak tipped over and I didn't have a floater attached to it!  Definitely get one of those too.  It's a decent carry about camera, and I always have this with me when I don't have my DSLR.  Good price too.  Amazon is great as usual, delivering on time, packed well.  I've ordered tons of stuff here and really only had one package that was lost probably the only one in maybe 150 orders total.

Schultz", "ReviewID": "R1UNL5XHXMIUXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera primarily for traveling. I have a full-size Nikon DSLR, but I wanted a smaller \"point and shoot\" since we were traveling light. The reason I chose this camera specifically was be cause it has a built-in GPS which will \"geotag\" your pictures if you turn that feature on. By using this feature, you can view your pictures with a program such as Google's Picasa3 and it will pinpoint the location on a map where the picture was taken.As far as the picture quality, even though it has a resoultion of 16 megapixels, I would call the resulting pictures merely adequate. It will not rival the picture quality of a DSLR even if the DSLR has a lower megapixel count. This is not necessarily a negative feature, just a notice that it is adequate for what I will call \"non-critical\" photography.As far as the operational features, Nikon did not seem to leave anything out! There is a mode for just about every situation imaginable. There is even a pet portrait mode! If  you are taking pictures of people, it can even detect if someone blinks! For the most part, 95% of my shooting was in the Auto Mode, but occasionally I would use the Museum Mode which disables the flash.Another great feature of this camera is its ability to take HD video in 1080p (with audio of course).One of the annoyances for me is the position of the lens. The normal tendancy is to hold the camera between your thumbs and index fingers. Unfortunately, if you are not paying attention, it is easy for the middle finger of your left hand to block the lens.As for the GPS (which is the main reason I bought the camera), it did its job well. One issue is that it rarely works indoors. Another issue is that you have to give the camera adequate time to acquire the GPS signal before taking the picture. There is an icon on the screen that flashes red while it is acquiring the signal then changes to solid when it is ready. About 95% of the time, the location of the picture on the map was spot on, but there were a few cases when it was off by as much as 100-150 feet (by my estimation).This leads me to the biggest negative of this camera; battery life. When the GPS feature is on, the GPS unit is still using up the battery even when the camera is off. Even when the GPS is off, the battery is still being drained by the camera. If you put a fully charged battery in the camera and do not even take any pictures, the battery will be drained in about a week. There is ample capacity to last all day with room to spare, but if you are on vacation or will be using the camera every day, you will have to charge the battery daily. My advice is to buy extra batteries. Even though Nikon (obviously) advises against using non-OEM batteries, I bought two non-OEM batteries and a charger and they worked just fine. One advantage of the non-OEM batteries is that they are 1400mAH as opposed to the Nikon battery which is 1050mAH so I was able to get a little more use out of the camera. I also bought a charger that plugs directly into the wall socket (as opposed to the Nikon unit that has a charger and a separate power cord) to save space.The bottom line is that this is a great little camera jam-packed with tons of fearures (most of which you will probably never even use) that takes decent pictures. Be sure to spend some time with the Reference Manual (avilable online for free from Nikon) to get the most out of the AW100.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera works great", "Author": "Christopher Dons \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R1M7X4QS2H2THD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This isn't an SLR camera so don't expect it to be.

I took a chance by going below 33 feet, and it survived.  However, I would prefer an external case that I could buy. - The flash is a disaster underwater, at least in low visibility water.

The camera takes nice photos in bright light and nice videos without hearing any sounds from zooming.  It's not as good in dimmer light as shutter speeds aren't kept high enough for moving objects.  The big problem I found was even though I set the ISO to AUTO, when taking photos underwater in underwater mode it didn't adjust the ISO high enough to keep high shutter speeds when pointing the camera down. As a result almost all photos of moving fish and sea lions came out blurred (not possible to get sharp shots of fast swimmers at 1/60 or 1/80 or even 1/100 sec).  It seemed to increase the ISO automatically only to 125 or 200.  My other camera I used underwater (Canon in a 10 ft max depth housing) increased ISO to very high numbers (800+) to keep shutter speed fast.  It was worth it to get non-blurred shots with that camera even though they came out grainy.

I bought this camera mainly to use when I didn't dare take one of the other cameras out in so much water. It is even nice not to have to be concerned about the rain, or the wet updraft from a waterfall, let alone at the beach, the river, the ocean, kayaking, rock terrain, sand, dusty riding or hiking. Yes the lens stays behind it protective glass that is itself quite will protected by the frame protruding just adequately beyond it. The other main attraction was the dropability. I was impressed by the shock-resistant aspect. I brag that I can drop it about the distance of my height onto any surface. But I can't get myself to intentionally do that. Still. I feel confident of its durability. I am also glad to have the GPS onboard. When I was considering ordering it, I was concerned about whether the resolution would be satisfactory, so, I chose to buy a refurbished one. The warrantee sounded good enough to take a chance. If I had known how much I was going to be using it and enjoying it, I would have bought the brand new one instead. But, I am very pleased with this refurbished one. No problem! One of the reasons that I can hardly stand to not have it at hand at all times is because it is so easy to take a really close shot. I am a beekeeper and I have been trying to get close-ups of the bees with the other two cameras and haven't been able to do with them what I can do with this one. The resolution isn't as good as I would like to be able to get eventually, but it is much better than anything that I have gotten at the beehive previously and the images that I send to the newspaper look good in print. This is the third water camera that I have gotten, and by far the best so far. I am very glad to have this at hand. Oh, and by the way, almost every time I open and close the water-tight door to the battery and SD card, I realize how much I appreciate the technology of that door and its latch and remember that comment about one of the reviews that criticized the latch as overly complicated and difficult to use. I get a really satisfied feeling from closing this particular latch that seems to have the feel of closing a submarine hatch. And opening the latch with only one hand is a skill that is pleasing to be a master of and takes little effort in accomplishing. And yes, if you guessed, I relocated the missing camera in the pocket of my beekeeping jacket. Now to get some close-ups of the kittens that are just beginning to get a little tiny bit of their eyes open. Of course, I can't get quite as close to them as I get to the honeybees that I can be almost touching with the lens and fill the frame with the bee and get fairly good focus and detail. Good enough for most uses, at a price that you wouldn't expect to be getting gallery quality, anyway. Yes, I did get the orange face. Sometimes I am really glad when it is so easy to find. In the beginning, sometimes I couldn't find it because I didn't see any orange face anywhere. That is when I learned to always set it monitor down. That side is all black. I like the looks of the black better, but the orange is handy and it is good for me to set the monitor face down to protect it from anything damaging it from above. Oh, and I really like how well it rides with me when the strap is around my neck. Excellent that it wears like a necklace, secured at with each end of the strap at a side of the camera instead of the wrist strap kind of tether. It is so easy to wear and to just lift and shoot. Easiest of any compact camera that I have ever used. It is when I am wearing it, though, that I would prefer that it had a the dignity of a black face. But, such a good image buddy, I can't complain.

I like to take a point and shoot on my travels (or to events) to grab the occasional shot when I'm not carrying my camera gear.  I had a great Canon PowerShot SD-950, which was small and took great pix, but it died during a recent trip.  After considerable investigation, I got the Coolpix AW100, since it was both small/light and waterproof.  It also had GPS, which was an added bonus.On the positive side, this is a very small camera, with a 10mp sensor that shoots full HD video.  Really terrific in a small package.This camera has several major drawbacks.  Principle among them is the poor quality shadow detail.  Pictures are just not very good - something I would not expect in a Nikon camera (even a point and shoot).  The image quality is quite unacceptable to me.  Granted that I am picky, but other point and shoots seem to have better image quality.Secondly, this camera a very slow from the time you press the shutter until the image is captured.  This is especially true on flash mode.  Very annoying.  And, if you hold the shutter down in low light, but the camera decides it doesn't need a flash, it will capture multiple images.In flash mode, the camera seems to overexpose all pictures.  You can compensate for this using the manual exposure adjustment.  But you have to remember to do that each time you turn the camera on.  Sort of defeats the concept of point and shoot.And lastly, the battery life is pretty poor.  Probably due to the GPS to some degree.  (On my Nikon D4, adding the GPS attachment cuts the battery life in half or more.)If you really need a waterproof camera, this might be a good choice.  But if you want an all-around point and shoot, pick a different one.  I just bought the Sony Cybershot RX100M2.

GPS function is placed in a menu that is so un-intuitively hidden that I ended up actually looking through the manual to find where it was. Plus it is disabled by default - duh, Nikon!Overall it is well worth having to not have to worry about it getting wet if you are fishing or hunting, or outdoors for other activities. I think this would be perfect for kayakers and white water rafting.I own and routinely use 4 DSLRs and 5 compacts, and this one has proven well worth its keep.

He worked to overcome things the camera was wanting to do and he never did get the auto-focus lamp to shut off completely, which is sometimes required when doing available light or night photography.In the end he returned the camera within 24 hours of purchasing it.Before anyone jumps on him, the day before he used a 5 year old Canon SX110 compact camera with no issue in a dimly lit building taking photos of a cat show and had no issues with that camera.  Using the Nikon CoolPix AW100 though is a much different story.What he said is the camera is good for outdoor photography and anyone who does any rafting, skiing (water or snow), or needs a rugged camera may very well like the Nikon.  For his purposes though the camera did not fit his needs or style of shooting. Outside, in good light the camera performed well enough but in low light situations he was very unhappy with the auto white balance (AWB) and the exposure settings.  He also indicated some of his issues could have been with the Nikon menu system and not thinking like Nikon but more like a Canon user.Rebecca Kyle, March 2013", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "FUN!", "Author": "Joann Stankiewicz", "ReviewID": "RRV7A88WPAXV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went snorkeling for the first time on vacation this past year and this camera made me look GOOD!!

We need a camera that can do the \"rugged\" thing, but that also can take standard point and shoot pictures in everyday indoor/outdoor situations. This camera does not take good pictures in those everyday indoor situations, and therefore we are sending it back.  I have used it for several weeks and can't seem to find the \"right\" way to take an indoor photo. If I use the flash, sometimes it will blow out the whole photo. If I don't, everyone has to hold perfectly still or else the image is blurred, even in what I would not consider to be low light. Sometimes the photo is great. I never know how it's going to turn out, so I have to just try it and if it's blown out or blurry I either have missed the opportunity or I have to stage the photo to happen again, after I have adjusted the flash. The intelligent auto does not seem to ever do the right thing.I also don't like the tiny buttons on this thing. I have managed it without much trouble, but I don't like having to navigate all the menus with tiny buttons.For reference, our previous camera was a beloved Panasonic TS1 which served us faithfully for several years before it finally got a permanently blurry lens.

In the last year I've purchased four cameras and this one is by far the worst of the bunch.  Some specific examples:- Forget the ability to take spontaneous pictures.  The camera takes upwards of five seconds from the moment you are ready to take a picture until the camera actually takes the picture.  What is it doing?- The flash sensor is essentially useless.  I did not purchase a completely manual camera or a high end DSLR where I can tweak the settings -- I bought a point and shoot to quickly take candids of my family.  Be prepared to throw away the majority of indoor shots as the flash will not fire when you would expect it to, and it will when you don't need it.- The recharge time on the flash is far greater than any camera I've used in years, about ten seconds.- Notice the lens does not have a cover in the off position.  How is this a good design?- Focus.  Even in good outdoor lighting conditions this camera fails to take crisp photos.This camera is straight out of 2005.  If you have not purchased a camera since then you might think these functions are normal or that this is a decent camera.  It is not.

And while the camera does a serviceable job on normal photos, it suffers from two large issues. (1) The lens window fogs easily, making any photos taken pretty much useless until the window clears. (2) The low light performance is poor.  In addition, my unit went into a lock/freeze mode in the ON condition (couldn't turn it OFF) where no buttons would function and it significantly discharged the battery in the span of 2 or 3 minutes. Had to remove the battery to reset it so that I could use it again. This only happened once; but, I'd only just purchased the unit a couple of weeks prior and have since sent it to NIKON for repair.By the way, NIKON's current return/repair process is not all that great.  Basically send it in at your expense and we'll get back to you at some point. No easy way to talk to anyone about your issue at all prior to sending an item in. Again, I'm surprised since my prior NIKON experiences several years back were great.The first item was surprising, as I was taking this camera to the beach and had some minor sea spray splash on the camera window. Guess what, the window fogged right where the drops of water hit. I could only imagine what would happen if I submerged it. In addition, as I was exploring some ancient temple ruins and went from the outdoors to inside the temple the lens fogged again. Same for some caves I was in.  Fogged lens = no or poor photos. While I have sent the camera in for repair, a late arriving email (took NIKON 2 weeks to answer) indicated that NIKON does have some language in the manual (and in the small print on it's advertisements if you can find it) that the lens may fog when the camera is subjected to \"extreme\" temperature shocks in humid environments.  Just how many of you have ever jumped into water that was warmer than the outside air when snorkeling? And by definition, snorkeling is normally a humid environment. But, NIKON did cover their behind I suppose.  Buyer beware and read the small print. I don't think they will be repairing my unit for this unanticipated feature, but we'll see.However, the camera is light and takes a pretty good photo if you have plenty of light. And, hopefully I'll be surprised at NIKON service after a rocky start. I'd really like to like this camera.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "FIRST RATE MACHINE.", "Author": "A. C.

Trying to look at the back LCD screen in bright daylight to frame a moving ocean wave or person proved to be challenge that didn't often work, thankfully digital lets you click a bunch of bad shots in hope that something comes out. Motion shots are also made difficult by the 'delay' in the shutter - actually I think it grabs a frame or two in advance of what you see on the screen. I notice this when trying to shoot a breaking wave and often got it before it broke.Having a Nikon previously helped a great deal in figuring out the crazy menus and adjusting the settings when needed - nice to be able to read them without my glasses. There are still things and menus after a month of shooting that I do not fully understand and have trouble getting back to - sometimes I get 3 consecutive shots, sometime I don't and how to view or pick one of them is still a mystery - may have try the manual someday.I did have the lens and back screen fog up several times and that ruined any shots taken until the condensation was removed (had to bring it back to the house and leave it open in dry conditions as recommended).

I would not recommend this camera as a daily use camera, but would definitely recommend it as a secondary shooter when one wants to capture memories in places normal cameras cannot go. My favorite feature is the video capabilities on this camera as it is fun to play with the slow motion (60, 120, 240 fps) and record things underwater or dust storms. There is no manual control feature which I wish was included as almost everything is based on presets. Low light performance is poor. Focusing isn't very sharp. Colors are acceptable but barely.

It took amazing pictures while out of the water.  It has an easy panoramic mode you can use which is pretty cool.  Used it a couple times for amazing pictures of our campsite and might even send one in to jeep to use as propaganda, lol.  The clarity is very good.  I did have some problems with taking night pictures of the Volcano.  I discovered if I used my flash on it it worked ten times better although I really didn't want a picture of the bushes in front of volcano. But because it focused on those the picture of the Volcano glow and smoke came out better.  Then I took it underwater snorkeling.  At first I was skeptical of the pictures it was shooting but that was mainly because of the water.  I took pictures while scuba diving and was trying to pay attention to my depth because I didn't want to pass the 33ft max depth rating on the camera.  My guide stated we would stay at 30 ft.  I took incredible pictures of the coral, the fish, other scuba divers in the crystal clear water.  Later on in the dive I discovered  I was still snapping shots at 39ft!!!  Ooops we went deeper than it is rated to go.  The buttons are a little on the tiny side and if I had gloves on it would have been difficult to use, so if you are in cold water where you need gloves I wouldn't recommend this camera or just make sure that you set it to underwater prior to go underwater.  There is also about 2-3 second delay for the record feature to start working.  If you are impatient like myself you might screw up the 3 minute video of you swimming around a sea turtle!!  GRRRRR!!!  Still upset about that missed opportunity.  But I still got 2 amazing pictures of him/her and a short 1 second clip.:)  This camera does the job REALLY WELL above and under water.  Just remember watch your depth and READ the manual on proper care of your camera.

So far it has exceeded my expectations.  Video is amazingly crisp and the camera is able to maintain focus and clarity in changing conditions without any issues.  I was able to mount it to the front of a kayak and film myself rolling repeatedly and it stayed sharp from bright sunlight, through transition to underwater and again transitioning quickly back up.  Stills are also impressive for a camera and lens this size.  I've noticed almost no distortion around the edges and excellent color reproduction.Pros: Waterproof, HD Video is truly HD, LED flash/ light is versatile and surprisingly bright, built in GPS geotagging function is great, excellent all around outdoor digital camera/ video camera.Cons: For a camera that is being sold to a more active target consumer, the body of the camera seems to be very prone to scratching, even when handled gently.  The same with the rear screen.  Nikon should provide a screen cover as they do on there DSLR's  (Which are more likely to be treated with kid gloves than something be advertized as being \"rugged\").  Controls are not always all that easy to handle even with thin gloves on.

So far (I haven't had it very long yet) it has performed beautifully and takes awesome pics and vids, with some of the pics having incredible clarity for a little point-and-shoot. Another great thing is the ability to use filters, as polarizers are so important when shooting water. In comparison to my Olympus Tough, this camera starts much faster, there's nearly zero pause between pushing the shutter and having the camera actually take the pic, and there is no lense cover to worry about getting sand in, having it stick open then rendering the camera unusable. Also, the software that this camera comes with, \"ViewNX2\", is a very useful tool. The camera controls, although a bit rough to get around at first, become pretty simple once you figure them out. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because A) like I've said, I haven't had it very long and B) it doesn't seem to be entirely compatible with PShop Elements 9 (I think it might be that PShop can't handle the resolution, but not sure).

I have shown a photo above of the screenshot of Nikon's warning. Please read what I have copied below from the Nikon website regarding grey market cameras. When I received my camera, the entire box besides major type was in Japanese (I didn't think anything of it), and there was no users manual, just a basic sheet with waterproofing information (also, mainly in Japanese). BUT here's where the problem comes in \"Additionally, a genuine Nikon Inc. USA product will include an Owners' Manual and Warranty Registration card in English. It will also include power cables (if applicable) designed for US style plugs. Any other language on the printed material or wrong cables indicates a Gray Market item.\"So, the verdict is grey market. I give this one star because of it.

If something does go wrong, I will be returning this camera and I will indicate here what happened.What is \"Gray Market\" ?Generally, a manufacturer works with a single importer who can sell and support their products in a given region. The importer usually has local dealers and distributors who resell the imported products; this is called a \"distribution channel\". Gray Market refers to merchandise that is imported and sold by methods other than these normal channels.For local safety regulations and certifications (FCC, CE, UL, etc.) and government requirements a manufacturer provides special packaging (manuals in the appropriate language, power cables designed for the local receptacle, etc.) and product engineering designed to meet local codes. Manufacturers also have service and support agreements with the authorized importer.Gray Market items are not designed to be sold in a particular market and cannot be supported by the authorized importer because they may not meet mandatory safety and certification codes. Because these items are not designed for a particular market they may not function properly, or the authorized importer may not be equipped to provide service, support or software.With the opening of international borders and the use of the Internet to sell goods, Gray Market equipment has become extremely common in the photographic and consumer electronics markets. Many different types of equipment are brought into North America for sale without the proper documentation and US consumers do not always know what they are purchasing.Because the resellers' cost is less they can sell Gray Market items for less. Unfortunately this price savings is only on the initial purchase; because service and support is more difficult to obtain it may end up costing the consumer more in the long run.Who is the authorized importer of Nikon Equipment into the USA ?Nikon Incorporated USA is the sole authorized importer of Nikon Corporation of Japan for photographic devices. Nikon Inc. USA pays shipping into the USA, import duties and taxes, and provides service, support and downloads for these products. Nikon Inc. USA ensures that the products they import are fully certified and safe for use in the USA market.Nikon Inc. USA cannot provide service, support or downloads for products that have not been imported by Nikon Inc. USA.How do I know if my Nikon product is \"Gray Market\"?If the deal was just too good to be true, it probably was. One of the first indicators that a piece of Nikon merchandise might be Gray Market is if the price is considerably less than most other resellers.Additionally, a genuine Nikon Inc. USA product will include an Owners' Manual and Warranty Registration card in English. It will also include power cables (if applicable) designed for US style plugs. Any other language on the printed material or wrong cables indicates a Gray Market item.Another indication of a Gray Market product would be photocopied manuals or manually created software CD's. Nikon Inc. USA always provides professionally printed or duplicated materials with genuine products.What does owning a \"Gray Market\" Nikon product mean to you?Nikon Inc. USA cannot provide any technical support or warranty service on Gray Market items. Additionally Nikon Inc. USA cannot perform any fee-based repair work on Gray Market items. Please do not contact Nikon Inc. USA for help with any Gray Market products. Please contact the reseller or importer of your Gray Market items for warranty and service information as well as software updates and downloads.Does owning a \"Gray Market\" Nikon product mean I don't have a warranty?No! All Nikon products come with a warranty by the manufacturer. The designated Nikon service center will always repair \"in warranty\" Nikon products and perform \"out of warranty\" repairs. If you own a Gray Market product it will need to be returned to the reseller or importer for service. Refer to your reseller or to the warranty cards included with the product for service contact information.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "COOLPIX AW100 DOG.", "Author": "hotengineer", "ReviewID": "R23N80E9M4KU7U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one.

The two things that made me opt out for the Nikon AW100 vs Canon's D20 was that it had a color option of black & the higher megapixels. While waiting for the battery to charge I went through and read some of the literature that came with the camera. I was immediately concerned when I read in the section of \"For Your Safety\" & how to care for your camera that it told you not to submerge or expose to moisture & not to expose to shock & vibrations. I initially thought that it might be some default typing for the Coolpix product family, but then I looked at the header & it's strictly for the Coolpix AW100. At this time I felt uneasy of actually exposing this camera to water & I am considering returning it. I wrote to Nikon about the print vs the advertising of what you can do & shouldn't do with this camera. Will post their response when I get it.After battery charged up, I fired some shots at different settings. For a point & shoot with a SanDisk Extreme SDHC card, it takes pretty fast pictures. I noticed about a 1/2 second in delay after pressing the shutter button. I'm already thinking that even though it's smaller & easier to carry around than my DSLR's, it's not going to be a good tool for taking pics of my kids which are constantly on the move. I also noticed that with the flash on auto 60% of my pics were over exposed.Overall, good size.

Sadly, I was not able to compare and explore more of its function as my car was broken into and happened to have the camera (serial number is 32108552) in the car.

It meets my expectations and needs, which include photo documentation of field projects at work and recreational photos with decent resolution.  Before i bought this camera online a year ago, I compared it with other brands of rugged outdoor digital cameras via online reviews.  Some cameras with lower resolution had comparable picture quality (measured by objective means) in these reviews.  One feature that attracted me to this camera was that it comes with a little bitty filter adapter, so if i like, i can play with filters (it actually takes fair photos with an IR filter -needs a tripod or steady base for that, of course) and protect the lens with either a skylight filter or lens cap. The adapter is plastic and the tab that holds it onto the camera body will wear out with long term use.  Also, the filter size that fits the adapter is pretty oddball: 40.5mm, which means you probably have to find a filter or lens cap through a comprehensive online photography supply shop or through mail order.  On a few occasions, I have gotten odd reflections in photos while using a filter.  Generally, I am very happy with the picture quality and resolution of photos i have taken with this camera.  I have gotten nice resolution on the closeup setting while capturing flowers or bugs or the odd soil or rock texture.  Photos and movie clips that i have taken of stage performances at night or in dark theatres turn out fairly sharp if the stage is brightly lit.  I generally have problems with blurry or grainy photos in low lighting conditions if i am not using the flash or a tripod, but that is not unusual for many cameras.  The controls on the camera are mostly intuitive, but the camera settings buttons and menu buttons on the back are pretty small and difficult to operate while wearing gloves.  The GPS function was not something I was interested in when i purchased the camera, but it seems to work.  At one point I copied the Lat/Long information from the EXIF data of a photo file and plugged it into Google Maps; and the location it yielded seemed pretty ball-parky.  It might be my imagination, but the compass and panorama functions seem to flake out in strong electrical or magnetic fields, like near high voltage power lines or large chunks of steel, but one can recalibrate these functions in the Map/GPS menu using the compass correction function.

It is very touchy leaving minimal room for error on taking photos and that you must really slow down on getting the 'hold button half way down' before taking photo.  This does help on static photos but action photos are often blurry, even when using the 'Sports' setting.  I am finding the best method is to put into continuous mode and hope that 1 out of the 20 or so that get exposed turn out.

I wanted a camera that took 1080P HD video and I liked that it had 16MP's and a CMOS chip. I found it on sale at my local Office Max and said \"what the hell\" and bought it. It cost about as much as it is here on Amazon. I had a few really good months on the lake with this camera, on the boat, in the water, under the water, and thought it was a good underwater camera. See some of my You Tube videos from this camera by typing RobertFlickinger AW100.I liked the interface and functions and took a lot of nice pics and HD videos. Until one day at the river everybody was jumping off the bridge (about 15'up)and decided to jump in while taking a video. So in I went, and when I came to the surface and inspected it I found that the display was black. Thinking that I might have just accidentally turned it off, I swam to the shore. Upon inspecting it I found that the DISPLAY SCREEN HAD FILLED WITH WATER. Later I removed the back display screen with a #3 Torx, (a specialty tool that I could only find online), cleaned it and dried the insides. The camera mostly works now with the exception of a couple of functions but can be worked around. But it still has those malfunctions.IF SOMEONE FROM NIKON READS THIS, CAN YOU HELP ME PLEASE?I guess I should have bought the extended warranty but Consumer Reports says to never do that, as in the long run you will save money.I originally  decided on this camera because it was rated for 33' underwater and was supposed to be shock proof from a 5' drop on a hard surface. I have an older Canon that was rated for only 13' underwater and jumped off that same bridge with it and did a lot off other crazy things; water skiing and crashing, snow skiing and crashing, and never a problem. As a matter of fact that Canon still works fine, but it only takes 480 video and is only 8MP.If you are never going to go swimming with the AW100, never going to jump off that damn bridge, and are only looking for a camera that takes nice videos and pics in the rain or on the beach, then I would say buy it. But if you are looking for a point-and-shoot that you actually want to use under the water, then do a little more research.If someone out there in Amazonland can tell me which waterproof camera to buy, I would love to hear your recommendation.Pros: 16MP, CMOS sensor, nice 1080p video.Cons: (somewhat, but) Not really waterproof.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "B", "ReviewID": "RRRT6FPQW1KIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this camera.

Compared to others I have tried, this one is a bit less impressive. While it serves its purpose underwater (if the water is clear enough, that is), it takes a while for the lens to dry off to take smear- and drip-free photos in dry air. Additionally, in heat/humidity, the lens fogs up, preventing clear images from being taken when not underwater. Moisture must have gotten inside during some of our underwater exploits. It's disappointing to have this problem in an UNDERWATER camera. An additional complaint I have to report regards the camera's lack of promptness in rapidly taking multiple photos. It takes a good 10 seconds to recuperate and ready itself for another image to be shot, which is frustrating for users who are not familiar with the camera (i.e. volunteer tourists who offer to take a photo for you, and then don't realize that 1. the button needs to be pressed and HELD for at least 2-3 seconds in order to effectively take the photo, and 2. it takes a LONG time for the camera to ready itself for subsequent photo-taking attempts).

Every picture is easy and clear, the shutter speed is fast so you can get a lot quickly in a row, it is easy to charge and battery life lasts a long time (weeks with use a few times a week), and although it has already been dropped several times, it is still working perfectly.  My only complaint is the hand strap - I have rather small hands (female) and can't fit my hand through so I don't know how anyone else would.

It's perfect for toting around while I'm out fishing or just about any other activity.  It fits in my pocket, its light, battery life seems good and it's made for one hand operation.  The only complaint I have is the pictures are a little soft.  At full size, you can't tell but if your planning on cropping the big photos down much, you might be disappointed.  But that's not really what this is for.  This camera is for snap shots and some cropping can be done without loss of quality.So far the camera is waterproof and has worked well for me.  The video modes are great.  Sure, the 240 FPS mode is at 320 pixels but it's still cool and the 720p 60 FPS mode is great for catching action or subtle slo mo.  The menus are a little clunky but when you figure out where things are, it's no big deal.  The ability to geo-tag shots and the map feature is kind of neat.  Easy to remember where you took the shot later.All in all, a sweet little camera.  Like everything else, there's a newer model with wi-fi but it's easy enough to put the memory card in my card reader.

The picture quality is superb and we used it for every photograph even the ones nowhere near water.Which brings up the point, if you want to have a carefree vacation, buy this camera. The only piece of electronics I had on me was this camera which meant that I did not have to care what I could and could not do around water while vacationing by the beach.

The camera was used in and out of cold waterfalls, toted along as i jumped from a 20 ft drop into a water hole mixed with sea and fresh water; as well as snorkeling off a beach without ever fogging up. the camera froze on me once, had to go back to shore, patted the battery compartment dry before opening and forced the camera to power cycle manually, went back within a few minutes in to the ocean without a hitch. The battery life depends on usage, i found that with the GPS function as well as movie mode drained the battery quicker than without those functions being used, but i still was able to get one days worth of vacation shooting on a 4 gb card. The GPS function is definitely helpful when you get back home from vacation in order to remember the places you've been. sometimes it takes the camera some time 10-15 minutes before the camera picks up your location depending on your over head cover. The camera does surprisingly well in low light conditions as well as 5-10 ft shots underwater, the colors at 5-10ft still come up well and require minimal color correction through Photoshop. The weakness is long distance evening shot focus, but i didn't really expect the camera to have that ability, manual focus is usually more precise; i couldn't find that function on the camera, will continue to play around with the camera to see if that function exists. Additional functions that would be helpful would be delayed shot capability for night shots, i figure that could be a software function update.

I have enough interest and ability to appreciate good equipment and make use of it; but not enough to invest in super-high-end equipment. My workhorse is a Nikon D80, but I don't suffer from brand loyalty the way some photogs do; my backup P+S is a Canon powershot, with which I've been extremely satisfied.Bottom line first: I was disappointed with this camera, and actually a little surprised at just how disappointed. For almost $300, I think it should perform better; I'm not expecting a top-quality image, but it should at least compete with the basic point-and-shoots. I figured that this would end up replacing my Canon as my backup camera, but basically I've ended up with a D-SLR, a P+S, and now a waterproof camera that I will only be using when I don't want to expose the other two to the elements. However, it does do one thing well: it's a tough cam, and it's proven itself very well in this regard. I've used it in the pool and on the beach so far, and haven't had any issues whatsoever.PROS: can be summed up as, it does what it's technically supposed to- Definitely feels solid in my hand. No question about whether it's going to fall apart on me.- Haven't had even a hint of moisture seep into it after pretty extensive use in somewhat rough waves (only caveat is that I haven't taken it any deeper than 5 feet so far)- GPS is a very handy feature. I never really thought I'd need or want it (geotagging is disabled on my phone), but it's really nice having an extra GPS unit when you're, say, kayaking and don't have your phone on you.CONS: can be summed up as, it doesn't do it well- Autofocus is pitiful at times. I have no idea what it's trying to focus on sometimes. I've tried adjusting the settings, and so far it seems that the continuous AF mode is absolutely useless (so much for action shots).- There's no auto-bracket. Seems like an easy feature to include. I am kind of shocked that it's not available.- The auto-rotate feature makes no sense to me whatsoever. Some photos are rotated on the camera's display (even though I'd prefer to disable that, but can't because it's not an option), but when I import them to my computer they need to be manually rotated. And again, very inconsistent. You can take the same shot several times in a row, and some are displayed vertical vs some horizontal.- The menus are not at all intuitive. Maybe I'm being critical, but on my D80 there are probably 5-6x as many entries, and somehow they're better organized than this. It makes it even more apparent that this menu is poorly organized, because its similar design reminds me of the D80, and how it COULD be better.- This one is really weird... I think there's a \"feature\" where if you shake the camera while in playback mode, it scrolls to the next image. Sometimes it goes forward, and sometimes it goes back. I haven't figured out a consistent way to make one vs the other happen. At first I thought my D-pad buttons were malfunctioning, but it definitely doesn't do this in any mode other than playback. I've tried to disable this in the menus, but unless it's somehow hidden (which I doubt, I've really given this some effort), I don't think this is something you can turn off. What's more, it's really inconsistent in how sensitive it is. I'm just waiting for the day that the photo switches right as I'm pushing the DELETE button and end up getting rid a photo I actually liked.- Oh, and in case the last point is related to the \"action control\" button: I've disabled this too. Some reviewers seem to really like it. It's every bit as gimmicky as it sounds. Yes, it lets you make a VERY LIMITED number of adjustments; but by the time you've shake-scrolled your way through the menu, you might as well have taken off your gloves and done it the right way.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "nikon coolpix camera/ with gps", "Author": "brenda darnell", "ReviewID": "R3GTTW9HJNAWV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this camera -it takes fantastic pictures-im documenting and old road that run thru alabama with it and its been great for that--fantastic camera", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "colleen", "ReviewID": "R1PJ0NQD1SRJ4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the camera but all the manuals were in Japanese which i do not know the language.

I wanted one and showed my girlfriend and she bought one for herself. I bought mine about a month later. That was summer of 2012. We used the cameras a number of times in the water (both fresh and salt) without a problem until May of 2013. Then things went bad. See updates for details.Update: 7/1/13: The camera worked well for about 9 months. Went to Maui in May and on the second day it fried. Was on a snorkeling trip off the coast of Lanai. About 30 minutes in the water it stopped working, took about 15 minutes to get back to the boat. I noticed that the focus assist light was flashing erratically, I dried it off and opened the battery compartment and could smell something had burned inside. After I got home, I sent it to Nikon for repair. They had to replace most of the electronics in the camera.My girlfriend's camera stopped working on the last snorkeling trip that week. It was getting \"foggy\" trying to take photos. Last week she grabbed her camera and it will not turn on, tried several batteries with no luck. She has not sent it back to Nikon yet, update on that when I know more.Not happy that two (2) AW-100 died on one trip. If it wasn't for having my Go-Pro with me, I wouldn't have gotten any good underwater shots. I will be much more cautious with the AW-100. May never take it into the water again though.Update: 3/10/14: After about 8 months of not using the AW100 that Nikon had repaired in the water, I went swimming in a pool and took the camera with me. I only submerged the camera a couple of times and only went maybe a foot or two under water. Camera started leaking immediately. These cameras suck, the waterproofing is a joke, I'm buying a Canon now. I will never buy a Nikon water camera again.The attached video shows the water moving around inside the camera. Also, I live in Nevada, in a very dry environment, there should not have been any condensation inside the camera when I changed the battery an hour before going in the water.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Harry G.", "ReviewID": "R3CGC1G0ZK191P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used the underwater camera for the first time on a Maui vacation and it worked exceedingly well particularly for a first time user.

Adjusting the exposure down on-camera or using a neutral density filter w/ the filter attachment helps, but isn't foolproof either. The new AW110 update has the same sensor and lens, so CAVEAT EMPTOR.The GPS feature also gets 5-stars and is the best of all current manufacturers.  In Hawaii, it tagged coordinates to each photo, as well as, the locations name - very nice!!!  The unique map viewer feature is also neat when hiking in parks, etc.  No other manufacturer features a GPS map viewer!I paid less than $200 on clearance for the AW100 w/o regret, but would recommend the Olympus TG-2 in the $350 range over the AW110 for an all-purpose waterproof camera - the sensor/lens system of the Olympus is much better.One tip: If shooting fish underwater, taking snapshots from video on computer yields the best results.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Lindsey \"Lindsey\"", "ReviewID": "R2D5I8NCXOGUD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my husband and he loves it.

As soon as I turned it on and took the first picture, it was blurry.  I thought I  would give it a try though. I read the manual and tried to change the settings.  The speed is slow, and processing of the picture is slow.  Out of 5 pictures I would take (whatever I was photographing), probably 3 would come out blurry and 1-2 would be a keeper.  I would spend more time deleting pictures, and missing opportunities to capture a picture perfect moment.  I would have to tell my subjects to remain very still while taking a picture. Not easy when you have a 2 year old. Even using the \"sports\"  option didn't work.  Images were blurred and overly bright or dark.The only pros I can see is that it is waterproof (although I haven't checked this) and is supposed to be shockproof.I own a Nikon D5000, and am happy with it.

The shutter speed is way slower than I'm used to, and the 16MP is really not that great. My previous camera was 12.1 MP and the pictures came out clearer and crisper than they did on this camera. Anyways we were using it like normal and one day it just stopped recording pictures. It couldn't have come at a worse time -- during the holidays and it was my son's first holiday season -- so I quickly replaced it with a tried and true Canon.

The price tag was reasonable and, after sifting through the reviews, I took the plunge (ha ha, puns).As for being waterproof, this camera did not disappoint. While it was awkward at first to take an electronic device into the water, this camera stood the test. I did not venture to the depths, but for the couple feet of water I was in, this camera performed beautifully.As for picture quality I am pleased. I'm a point-and-shoot kinda girl so I'm not expecting high quality, but for my needs this was great. Plus it was great to not have to worry about getting water or sand or other debris into the camera. Additionally I like the multitude of shooting modes. I tend to leave the camera on auto, but it seems to do a fine job of choosing the appropriate shooting mode. And the panorama mode is pretty neat too!The biggest problem I have with the camera is the placement of the lens. I kept taking photos only to find part of my finger in the picture. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that I'm left-handed or not. But it is something to be aware of and is pretty easy to fix.Of course, the proprietary charger is a bit annoying as it meant bringing yet another cable with me on vacation, but I survived.Overall, good camera for the money - definitely waterproof - decent quality for a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Craig D.

I blew that away, took out the battery, recharged it, and the camera came back to life once the battery was fully charged and re-inserted. From then on I was very careful about making sure the door was closed properly, and had no further issues.The camera worked fine for about 6 more snorkel trips (~10hours in the water, with frequent dives to about 6ft down) and a snuba trip that included dives to about 25ft.I had a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 for the trip 2yrs ago and loved it too, but the pictures with this AW100 were significantly better quality (at least to my untrained eye). Only other issue was that the lens fogged up on the inside on the last trip out (after a snorkel of about 1.5 hrs), but I found I could control that by keeping the lens pointed at the sun when not using the camera (I had seen the exact same thing with the TS2, which is why I bought a new camera). Have not noticed the fogging after the trip.BTW, the GPS option is very useful for determining where the pictured were taken, so that is a great feature, but turn it off if you are going underwater to save battery life.So some issues, but it takes great pictures, so overall very happy with the camera and would/have recommend it.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "wven villa", "ReviewID": "R2LI8L0H4RI5AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "takes great pictures under water and out of it, brings several features, meets all my expectations.

It can rain there everyday and we were doing watersport activities everyday.  I would say 1st off - I owned a Canon SD650 point and shoot camera prior to purchasing this one (which is not waterproof).  This is the 1st waterproof camera I've ever purchased.  It does the job.  It was very liberating NOT to worry about any type of moisture.  The camera actually took good shots of fish underwater as long as there was enough light.  That being said - I think my canon took better quality pictures overall.  I used the EASY AUTO MODE 1st thinking it would be great but the auto mode is not so smart.  Always seem to switch to some crazy mode like \"sunset\" mode when it was clearly bright outside.  I got some really crappy pictures because of some crazy modes it was in.  After a few days - I just put it in simple AUTO MODE because it simply worked better.  The switching of modes buttons and screen menus were not intuitive.  It was not impossible to learn but the canon was better.  The reaction time to shutter button was the worse thing - it would take a good 1-2 seconds for the shutter to release - monkeys would have swung away by then!!  That was slightly annoying.  LASTLY - on day 3 - after taking a picture on a sunny hike - the camera crapped out - all the buttons seemed to be working but all I got was a black screen.  Took pictures but thought that it was night time and flashed.  I figured out the shutter was stuck closed since everything was working but camera kept thinking it was nighttime.  I read over the manual that night to no avail so I did what every good consumer would do - looked up the problem on google.  Low and behold - someone blogged about the same exact problem - the shutter gets stuck and you \"gently\" bang the unit to your thigh (seriously??).  I tried that the 1st night to no avail so I was hopelessly sad that I purchased this new camera that worked for only 3 days of our vacation.  However, my tour guide said that it was probably partially due to moisture condensation so gave me a bag of rice to put the camera in to draw the moisture out.  Next morning - shutter was still stuck but when I banged it on my knee (gently) - the shutter came loose and the camera was back on!!  It hasn't stuck again for the next 5 days of vacation and now.In Summary - if you need a water proof camera but don't need UBER wonderful quality photos - this will be just fine.  The camera's talent is \"waterproofness\" so I am tolerant of less beautiful pictures than my canon. Shutter speed could improve and don't use auto easy mode (sucks).  I still want another \"land\" point and shoot camera for beautiful pics.

I genuinely couldn't be happier with this camera.I was really apprehensive about buying it since several reviews stated that it died the first time it entered the water and that the camera was unreliable and poorly made. I can assure you that the camera doesn't die and isn't poorly made. The quality of the pictures that I took easily compete and in most environments exceed that of my digital SLR camera. In fact for my vacation I used my digital SLR on the first day and then after using the AW100 a few times didn't pick up the SLR once for the remainder of the vacation.One recommendation I would make is that if you're going to get this camera then definitely spend the extra $10 and get the Extreme SDHC card to go with it rather than a standard card. This guarantees that your memory card can withstand the same conditions that your camera does in addition to protecting the images taken and stored on it.Overall, absolutely great camera and having owned it for a month I've taken it snorkeling and hiking, on planes, trains and automobiles, in addition to using it in extreme humid, hot and conversely cool conditions and am yet to find a single fault!

I have always shot with Canon and Panasonic Lumix cameras in the past, but the features and video capabilities of this unit intrigued me, so I took the plunge.Yuck.The stills are very soft in focus.  Anything detailed in the distance gets washed out.  It looks like a 2MP camera, not a 16MP (yes, I am shooting at full res).  I thought I must be dreaming so I shot identical stills with my old Lumix DMC-ZS3 and the Nikon AW100, and the Panasonic stapled the Nikon's nipples to the wall and stole its girlfriend in terms of image definition.  The focus point the Nikon chooses seems to be the far point of the depth of field, because the object that the green focus indicator in the center of the image lights up on and everything closer seems to be in ok focus, but anything farther away is soft and undefined.  The Panasonic gives much deeper depth of field and everything from near objects to infinity are very sharp and defined.  The Lumix only shoots 720p vid, but even that looks better than the 1080 the Nikon puts out, and the zoom when filming on the Nikon is a single speed and faaaar too fast.  The Lumix will zoom in slowly if you move the rocker switch a short distance, and zoom in faster if you move it farther.  The Nikon has a single zoom speed on it's tele/wide rocker button, and it's distractingly fast.I returned this camera.

I got this little camera for those times when I can't carry my DSLR with me at work or on a trail, and in that regard it has not disappointed.  It's light, compact and durable enough to be used in most weather conditions.  I say most because like anything that's dependent on battery power, the AW100's performance is likely to degrade somewhat in extremely cold conditions (below -10 degrees C.)  I'm unlikely to use this camera in underwater shooting conditions or to make much use of the GPS features because I would use other equipment for those things, but I appreciate the ability to take it fearlessly into rainy or snowy weather.Small and light are things that make a camera portable, but they don't contribute anything to your ability to make an image without camera shake.  Enter Nikon's vibration reduction system.  I made a point of checking image sharpness with hand-held shots taken of the moon when it was low on the horizon and other distant light sources on profoundly dark nights.  I found the results to be very satisfactory when I took the simple additional step of bracing myself against something solid and stationary before shooting.I particularly like the 16MP resolution and Nikon's ED lens elements, which make it possible to have high quality enlargements from a small point-and-shoot camera.Two critiques:  1) Nikon advertises the camera as shock resistant after having conducted drop tests at a height of 5 feet onto 2\" plyboard.  The camera does seem to be sturdily built and the access door for the battery and SD card seems to be strong and appears to lock simply and securely.  However, Nikon's documentation makes it clear that their tests were conducted under specific circumstances and that dropping the camera may result in loss of its water-tight integrity as well as other functionality.  I'm just sayin'.  :-)  2) Although many people don't bother to read owners' manuals anymore, it would have been nice if Nikon had included a paper version of the manual rather than just a Quick Start Guide and a pdf that you put on your computer.  The camera does offer a number of features that you might not otherwise become aware of or know how to access/operate without the manual, and most of us aren't going to be carrying our laptop or our tablet into the woods all the time.Overall, a very nice little all-weather camera that delivers beautiful images and is well worth the money.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little thing!", "Author": "Donovan Larson", "ReviewID": "R3E9ZOJJMS6X7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very impressed with this camera and its abilities in low light.

I wanted an underwater video camera as I am an avid photographer and will be using my Canon SLR 50D for pictures on land and this camera for underwater.  I took this camera to a local pool to test the underwater features.  I had no problem whatsoever. Set camera to wide angle so focus wasn't a problem.  Set camera on highest quality 1080p video.  Image quality was very good but you don't have control over exposure, which could be a big downside.  Don't expect good sound from this camera, however.  Since you have to open up a small waterproof compartment to access the battery & memory card,  tiny grains of sand or salt water could possibly cause this compartment to leak. To prevent leakage, you must be very careful about any foreign objects lodging in the waterproof seals.  This camera doesn't feel rugged and I suspect it will sustain damage if dropped. If you want an underwater video camera, this camera works well for its price range.

I have several cameras and my use for a \"rugged\" camera is solely for our annual Jersey shore vacation. Before \"rugged\" cameras I was loosing a point & shoot yearly to a rogue wave or some other mishap on the beach.Reviews of the AW100 were generally positive and I leave aspects like picture quality and features to other reviewers. I suspect the camera may be fine or even great for many users, but it failed me badly for the particular purpose for which I had bought it - to use it in the surf at the Jersey shore. And my comments pertain to only that one aspect of the camera.The issue is condensation on the inside of both the lens and the LCD screen when the camera is in cool water. Setting the stage, the Atlantic in NJ in August varies between 60 & 72 degrees (lets say 65), and the daytime air temp typically between 80 and 90, or a bit higher, and humidity is usually in the mid to high 80's. So there is a fair degree of separation between air and water temps, as well as humidity to deal with. As soon as I'd take the camera into the surf the lens would fog up on the inside (condensation) and pictures and video appeared as if shot through the densest fog imaginable. And of course auto focusing through that foggy lens was hit or miss at best - but that's neither here nor there, because the pictures were useless anyway. Once I noticed the problem I began just wading into the surf, attempting not to submerse the \"waterproof\" camera. But even this failed as mere droplet splashes from the surf would fog the lens. And this happened every day of our vacation, no matter what tricks I tried - and I tried many.I detailed this to Amazon and they promptly sent a second AW100 to my home. Upon returning home I tested both the original and new AW100's. In water that is close to air temperature (like a pond or swimming pool) both cameras worked fine - no fogging. However, cooling some water in a bowl to around 65 degrees caused both cameras to fog, and the air temp was only in the low 80's that day.One very puzzling thing to me is that the AW100 manual cites the condensation issue, says it's NOT a malfunction, and tells you how to clear it. And that's true - the camera is not broken or leaking, and the lens will clear in time (5 min avg). BUT, all pictures taken while in that fogged state are totally useless; and once you return to the water you're back to fogged up again immediately. To me it IS a malfunction when a waterproof camera cannot take a picture in or around cool water. And, as mentioned before, I have had another waterproof camera (Olympus Tough 1030 SW) which did fine at the Jersey shore for a number of years. Hence I know that fogging in 65 degree water does not need to happen - my Olympus Tough never once fogged, even in very similar conditions. Was it metal body vs. plastic body? I have no idea, I just know that the Olympus never fogged and the AW100 fogged almost immediately upon contact with cool water.I have returned both the original and replacement AW100's. Fortunately I have until next summer before needing to worry about another waterproof camera. I'll see what's available then, paying particular attention to the condensation issue.I give only one star, but depending upon your needs the AW100 may warrant a higher rating. It flunks the Jersey shore test badly, but if your needs are for the backyard pool and/or the Caribbean it may perform just fine. That said, if you get one I suggest you do a water test immediatly. And make sure the water is as cool as you're likely to encounter. Don't base it upon lukewarm bathtub water or your fish tank or even the fact that it's water tight. Because it is water tight - yet it still builds up condensation on the inside of the lens when there's a fair degree of difference between air and water temps.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not waterproof - Maybe splash proof", "Author": "Don_Drapper", "ReviewID": "RO23YIHCF6HM7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera is great!

The second camera was obviously another return that was not even opened by the supplier.

I called Nikon and the best they could tell me was that the audio will be strong when played on a computer or other.  I tried it and it was.

My problem used to be damage to my digital camera and now my problem is losing the undestructable camera. Anyhow, I've had my shares of these types of cameras. The Nikon COOLPIX is a fun color, easy to use and takes pretty good pictures. I've had the camera for about 2 months now and have taken it skiing, hot tubbing, through family functions with children and it's survived. The only reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is because I had the Olympus camera and it's by far the best in class. Prior to a water tubing incident where I somehow came up out of a turned over tube in water with beer in one hand and no camera in the other, I had the Olympus for over a year. I've never had any functionality problems with it, and as far as user friendly was concerned, it was top notch. The Nikon however is stuck on a setting where the flash is only on auto or off. On auto, it doesn't always take the best pictures at night because the flash doesn't go off and there is NO WAY to make the thing go off until you take a million pictures and hopes it flashes. It's also stuck on a setting where all the pictures on the review, is on a slide show and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it off of the slideshow. The manual didnt help so now I'm stuck. The only thing the Nikon has the Olympus could do a better job at is clarity and auto focus. Even in the dark it has an amazing clarity to it, even though its just.. dark.

I look forward to the day that i have to dunk it in a creek because i just dropped it in a puddle of mud and my display has too much dried dirt on it to see what pics im taking.

I plan on taking it for another 4-5 hours tomorrow and know that i won't need to worry about it. This is an extremely reliable camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone. It is small enough to keep in a pocket. Durable enough to let hang from your neck without worry. You can use it in the rain, underwater anywhere you want to take a picture, but can't because your Digital SLR might get damaged. I would suggest this camera as a perfect backup if you are a serious photographer and need something for the sticky situations. It is very easy to use. The battery takes about 3-4 hours to charge initially. The strap is kind of a pain in the butt but, you can replace this easily. Don't be discouraged if you are like me and the pictures don't look so HQ on the display. They always look better once blown up on the computer. Don't let anyone fool you. This is a 16 MP camera and it takes great pictures.

It is advertised as waterproof to 33feet.  The first time in the water it quit working after 10 minutes.  I rinsed it off in fresh water and thoroughly dried it out before opening it to check.  Sure enough it had leaked seawater into the case.  Well, no more pictures for the rest of the trip. I had followed the instructions for use in the water precisely as written in the owners manual.  It was never more than 2 feet deep and treated very gently during all use.If it had not been for the leak and failure I would have rated the camera very high.  It is very intuitive, easy to use and, for the most part, takes excellent pictures. The only fault I could find with it prior to the leak is the fact that it has no manual settings.  I could not over ride the internal focusing to obtain an infinity setting to allow a clear picture to be taken of the full moon.  Movies were easy to produce causing me to leave my video camera home.  Luckily I have a smart phone so I was able to take some pictures the rest of the trip.I will revise and perhaps upgrade this review depending on how Nikon responds to the returned camera.

At 16 mega pixel setting, it will go through a battery after ~100 pictures.  Never could get panorama to work - even with the 32 GB disc.  I bought 3 back-up batteries & they weren't easy to find at that in Flagstaff & Sante Fe.  Pictures are not awesome by any means, but I am just an amateur & did not want to take the Cannon Rebel Ti1 this time around as we did a lot of hiking & that camera is just too bulky. Seller of generic battery said it was no different than Nikon, but OH yes they are!  I will be purchasing true Nikon battery for the camera as generic can ruin a camera.  Note the gold plate on back of Nikon battery is missing on generic & I believe this has something to do with camera reading battery life, etc.  The other battery can be read by camera, but I suspect only lab testing could determine difference between the two.4 STAR 3/2014 UPDATE:  We took this camera and a Go Pro to Hawaii this year.  And to my utmost surprise, this camera almost out performed the GoPro in underwater shots of fish, etc. while snorkeling.  Had no \"leakage\" problems, though we were only in 10-12 feet of water most of the time.  The GoPro simply offered more options, like reviewing video on iphone and wide angle views, plus different ways of attachment (head & wrist attachment options that can be purchased separately).  I didn't purchase any \"safety float\" attachment for Coolpix as it hung comfortably from my neck while snorkeling.  Wish I had used it more for travels around the island vs iphone - no comparison of these two when taking photos - iphone just doesn't get there for me.  So my initial 3 Star has been updated to 4 Star.  It would probably merit a 5 Star if I would take more time to learn how to use if more effectively.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "J.

I think that when you purchase an all-weather camera you come into it knowing that there are going to be some trade offs but I expected a little more from Nikon.  This is my first Nikon camera and I have to say I was very disappointed.  Two of the features espoused by Nikon are its smart software scene modes and its low light capability.First, the scene modes. There are a bunch of them and basically none of them are useful.  Your best bet is to put it in to auto mode and try and adjust the settings there which are very limited to say the least.  Plus, there is a very annoying quirk to the settings where some features are only available when you are in a certain scene mode and with around 30 scene modes that can be pretty frustrating.Second, the low light shooting. I have experience with DSLRs and this camera comes nowhere close in low light.  Even in a well lit room indoors the pictures are either over-exposed due to the flash going off or they come out blurry without the flash.  The sad thing is while it can't compete with a DSLR which isn't surprising it also can't compete with my iPhone.  In the same indoor lighting situations I had to fight to get a decent photo from the Nikon while my iPhone had no problem at all. In my opinion a huge failure on Nikon's part bordering on false advertising.Finally, I think it bears noting that when I first bought this camera one of the panels came loose on the bottom and I had to send it to Nikon to be replaced by a new one.  While the replacement came quickly and easily without issue the fact that I needed a replacement after one week is also a bad sign.Positives.  A couple positives are the GPS works pretty well and its a very attractive looking camera.  Plus if you take pictures in decent light then you can get some excellent looking photos.I have to imagine that there are better cameras out there that are as tough as this one and so I would advise anyone looking for a tough camera look at Olympus, Panasonic, or Samsung before this camera its just not worth buying.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waterproof use review", "Author": "Drylbits", "ReviewID": "R331U9A5IT64FH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this camera 3 months ago and I was very happy with the photos. I'm easily satisfied so although it becomes blurry when zooming on in an object being video recorded, I did not complain... Good underwater photos and videos too... However, recently when I used it underwater, the screen went black. Sea water got inside after 3 months and screwed it up. The screen was black and it started working after a week only despite cleaning and drying it up. Initially after it started working, the screen would turn black after every shot so I have to turn it off and on again so I can take photos. It did that for a few days, then resumed working but looking at the USB part inside, it's started to corrode. Now I have to have it replaced before it's warranty runs out. Another problem is when using it under water, the lens would get foggy at times which is annoying and you would have to wait till it clears up again. I had cheap underwater cameras before that never had problems with water seeping to the inside but this one disappointed me in that aspect...unfortunately, that's the biggest aspect for me as Im always in the water.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, Not Great", "Author": "David Stewart", "ReviewID": "RAJ16HOXA6A2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera.

Smith", "ReviewID": "RP1AHN6FH6BSV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am no camera newb.  I've owned Minolta, Canon, and Nikon DSLRs (a D5100 right now) and Fuji and Sony digital point and shoots.  I don't like backpacking with my DSLR and after losing two Sonys to water damage during our outdoor activities, I extensively researched waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof point-and-shoots until I settled on the Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video (Orange).  My wife and I are avid hikers and backpackers, so something that could put up with abuse was a must.  Additionally, we loved the orange color because it was easy to find in a pack full of a weekend worth of essentials.  But alas, after two weekends in the wilderness, we found that this camera just doesn't fit the bill.  My biggest complaint is noise.  At any ISO over 200, there is so much noise in the images that they are unusable.  And as anyone who's spent any amount of time in the woods can attest, there's not a lot of available light, so unless we wanted to keep the camera in manual mode and use a tripod or shoot with the flash all the time, there was no way around this problem.  Maybe if you plan to spend a lot of time at the beach this would be your camera, but for anything requiring low light performance, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I've returned mine to Amazon and will be receiving the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX20 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Orange) (2012 Model) in a few days.  Hopefully I'll have better results.Pros:-Rugged.  Though I didn't drop it or get it wet, I know build quality when I see it and this thing is built to last.  I have no doubt that it would have lasted a long time.-Buttons are a pro to me.  The biggest worry I have about other models is how well a touch screen will work when wet or with gloved hands.  Having buttons was nice.-Start-up time.  It's amazing, push the power button and almost as fast as you can move your finger to the shutter button you can take a picture.-Case color.  Never came even close to misplacing it!Cons:-Low light noise.  This is the deal breaker.  What good is a camera if the sensor isn't sensitive enough to get a good picture in anything but the brightest light?-Sharpness.  Again, this is no good.  Many pictures looked way too soft.-Focusing intelligence.  This is a personal issue probably, but we love taking pictures of our dog when we're outdoors.  Dog faces aren't people faces and in Auto mode, this camera really struggled with this, which was kind of funny.  Either the tip of his nose was focused and his eyes were blurred, or his eyes were focused and his nose was blurry.Neutral/Musings:-The GPS seems like a gimmick to me.  Serious backpackers will have a dedicated GPS, so it's not difficult to cross reference photo time with track points.  Anyone relying on a camera to be their GPS and photography gear is asking for trouble as the battery life isn't sufficient to do both well.-The charger is a corded model.  I don't understand this; my Nikon D5100 has a wall charger and every Sony point-and-shoot that I've owned uses a wall charger.Ultimately, a camera needs to take good pictures and in my experience this one didn't.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Water leakage after using only a few times!", "Author": "Justin Mytwocents", "ReviewID": "R1US3HUXXL1DY0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update after 6 months.......sending the camera back because of water leakage.

I received my AW100 today, and upon examining the sealing mechanism for the battery/memory card access hatch, I can see why ... it is a single-edge/lip compression seal that could be easily compromised by an overlooked piece of grit or strand of hair. For comparison, if you take a look at how the Olympus TG-820 door is sealed I assure you ... it will instill considerably more confidence.2) My other disappointment ... and I will admit I overlooked this attribute until I received my AW100. The battery (apparently) can not be charged in the camera. You must remove the battery and charge it in the (provided) charger. The charger is not very compact, and ships with a separate power cord (not one of the built-in/flip-out plugs).

The photo quality was terrible! I'm an avid photographer, but not dependent on having a fancy camera. My last point-and-shoot more than lived up to my expectations, letting me take snapshots, close-ups of flowers, and landscape photos. But I REALLY wanted a waterproof camera so I tried this one.The photos were washed out and often out of focus. Even when mostly in focus, the focus was often soft around the edges. The color quality was lousy - both washed out and too dark in the same image. Close-ups were a nightmare - I had to delete almost all of the pictures I took of tropical flowers because they were SO out of focus -  and landscapes were better but still solidly in the mediocre range. And the user interface (button placement etc) was clunky too.I was less dissatisfied with the underwater shots... but then, my expectations were lower. I expected a memento from the trip, not an image I could hang on a wall, and that's what I got. Overall I've never had so much trouble with a camera!", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Abe", "ReviewID": "R19ZACWKII4J5E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera \"Used- Like New\" for $40 less than retail. No complaints there. It was like new and it worked great right out of the box. The reason I bought this camera was because of the 1080p video in stereo, 16mp, the non-exposed lens, and all of the durability features. I was anxious to get it because I had a 4 state trip to go on and I wanted to make a photo journal of the trip. I should have brought the charger. The battery in this thing is weak. It is a 3.7volt, 1050mAh rechargeable battery that wouldn't make it past 150 shots in the daytime with no flash. The camera takes great photos and good videos, but it almost seems to me like its affiliated with Apple because it records video in .MOV format and nothing else. It almost makes me think that Nikon is Apple's un-official line of digital cameras. I am absolutely, 100% against the Apple regime, so this is a problem for me. I had to buy a video editing program that accepts .MOV format files. The program is slow on most computers, even on my higher-end desktop. Another problem I've had with 2 of my computers is getting the computer to recognize the camera. Connection via USB is time consuming and slow. And something about the way that this Nikon formats memory cards prevents me from viewing photos and videos straight from the card. It would be nice to have some alternate firmware that would allow this to be more of a Windows camera. File formats and connections aside, the video quality is up to par. The waterproofing is a pretty neat from what I've tested so far. I pressed record and dropped it into my friends fish tank and it made for an entertaining video. I've read other reviews since then, and I think I'll reserve that feature for when I might really need it.  Many of the 1 and 2 star reviews said that the camera leaked upon firs submersion. Scary thought. Other than the battery life, connection issues, and the .MOV format, it is a great camera, but these three things really limit what I can do with it. I sell used equipment so it is absolutely necessary that I have a durable camera, which this is. It is great for taking photos in the rain, and the fact that there is no exposed telescoping lens helps to prevent things from breaking when it gets bumped on steel and such.1-30-13 - UpdateThis camera has grown on me. I've used it underwater, in snow, dropped it, and it's still working great to this day. I've been able to work around it's formatting faults once I began experimenting with other video editors, and the SD card issue was resolved by using a better card reader. The battery life isn't as bad as I first though, but I recommend spending an extra $20 on a cheap set of 2 extra batteries and an additional charger.I've upped the rating to 4 stars, but I'd almost consider giving it 4 and a half. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u00bd", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "a review of amazon", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "RK43A435S4UIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "yes i love this camera. i was pretty sure i would, due to to extensive research. mainly, i would like to thank amazon for treating me so well in the purchasing of this product. the first one i received was clearly used. naturally, i was unhappy. but amazon came through!!! with an extremely fast turn around. i received my new one in 3 1/2 days. the return process was easy and fast. i will certainly continue to do business with amazon. 5 stars for amazon", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "not good so far", "Author": "Teri Watson \"i am Amazon\"", "ReviewID": "R3KC6LYGE6R9AY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Man! this is my 3rd Nikon Cool pix that sucks!so ok, i have a Nikon D90-dslr.so i know what is clear image..i even call my D90 \"bad-photographer proofed\"just bc in cheat mode = Auto, pictures are very crisp and clear.i had been browsing for some tough snap and shoot.read some reviews..the reviews were good/bad.but what caught me was the cmos sensor [i thought in a snap and shoot cam??\"]there's something about the cloudy, blur element to itit's like even the monitor shows that blur-y capturing..anyways, i will try on day time if this holds up.also, i am not so sure how the battery compartment will remain tightif underwater..more later then..", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not so Cool", "Author": "Bob in the Valley \"Bob in the Valley\"", "ReviewID": "R2TV8LVA3LB8A7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First you have to understand I am a D90 Nikon owner.

So when I wanted a pocket camera that I could easily stick in the pocket of my ski jacket or in the bike bag while out cycling, I went to Nikon first and thought this camera would be perfect -- small, waterproof, shock-resistant and 16 MP.  After the cameras first use, however, I packed it up and returned it without a second thought.  Here is what I found \"wrong\" with the camera:1) After walking around downtown Washington, DC snapping images in and around the monuments for 90 minutes the battery was depleted.2) The menus were difficult to navigate and there were too many settings that I had no control over.3) The camera repeatedly had problems focusing in situations in which it should not have (e.g., Washington monument against vivid blue sky).4) The quality of the images was very disappointing.  Even at the lowest ISO settings, there was a lot of visible sensor noise, and all of the images were a bit soft and edges were not sharp.  Some of this may be due to the fact that the camera only supports JPEG image files but even if that is the case Nikon should have offered a numerically lossless compression option.5) Rather than using a standard micro-USB cable, Nikon opted to have a non-standard USB connector for the camera.  Given all the other cables that I have to carry around while traveling this is a nuisance.  Why couldn't they have used the standard micro-USB that many peripheral devices use, including the Nikon DSLRs?FYI, I replaced the Nikon AW-100 with a Canon S100, and I am quite impressed thus far.  The camera allows either JPEG or RAW images to be captured, the menus are easy to navigate and the battery life is much longer.  And while the S100 only has a 12 MP sensor, the image quality and detail is vastly superior to the AW-100's 16 MP sensor.
