The picture recording feature is great as well. Screen clarity is decent but very viewable.  Colors are a little crazy but I attribute that to not-so-great camera unit.  There are color customizations in the on screen menu though.cons:The outside camera unit is not sufficiently water resistant.  I've had to open it up and dry it a few times after heavy rainstorms and the unit is in a covered housing.The gate/door opening button in the LCD unit only works with door buzzer systems and not single circuit, one button gate opening systems.  I had to wire up a separate button to control my gate.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002LT2FFQ"}}
