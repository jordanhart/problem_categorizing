I am a Panasonic user, and have bought many of their pocket cameras for the family.  I also own a Cannon T50 SLR with three lens, some Sony's and others.  I previously owned the Panasonic FZ8, prior to getting the FZ60, which is a major upgrade in my kit.  The FZ8 has taken thousands of great pictures, and is now in the hands of my college nephew, being put to good use in the field.I have taken several sets of picture themes, Sports (football, motorcycle racing), indoor, video outdoors, scenery and sun sets.  Of the 300 plus pictures taken only four were blow due to poor focus or exposure.  I believe one was my fault, being to quick with a pan shot.The football shots were shot in good light during the day.  Exploiting the massive reach of 600 mm lens to the wide angle of the 25 mm lens created some stunning shots.  I captured burst shots from 70 yards with great clarity, also capturing a panorama of the entire field from the bleachers at mid field that was stunning and perfectly stitched together.  The 16 MP MOS sensor is a huge improvement over the 7mp I had before.  Only issue noted was the limited number of shots in burst mode.Motorcycles, at 120 MPH captured in video and stills both panning, and burst mode.  From the timing stand, taking video the auto wind cut filter removed all the ambient wind noise, leaving the throaty rasp of the Suzuki's and Ducati's.  Manual panning was good, and I think will improve as I get more comfortable with the camera.  I find the dedicated video button a welcome addition.  Only once did I hit the focus button as opposed to the video button, again muscle memory will take care of this.Indoor, what can I say, no red eye when using the program mode, or any other.  iA is also nice and in certain situations handy when people are moving about between different light sources.  Flash is very effective, much more range than my old FZ8Outdoor scenery looks like it will be fun.  With the creative mode you can easily flip to different effects.Long tele shots are superb, the only drawback here is the the slow auto focus at these insane distances.  Manual will come in handy here.I find using the menus OK, I have used them for years and they seem natural to me.  AE/AF/Lock is the only button I have not come close to mastering yet.I considered the FZ-200 but with the difference in price it was hard to justify for my amateur needs.  I have not missed RAW for my portrait pictures, the JPEG images from the FZ60 are excellent.  I usually only adjusted lighting/contrast and sharpness anyway, and the FZ60 is doing a fine job with white balance set to auto.I am very please with this camera and have recommend it to several friends.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera/Great Pictures", "Author": "Big Mike", "ReviewID": "R2IMXOSX5S9VJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yo-Chose this camera for it's great rating in Consumers Reports (#1 in the Super Zoom category) and the twohundred fifty pricepoint at fortysecond street photo.I almost didn't get it - instead of the Canon SX50 HS because of the Canons 50x zoom vs. the Panasonic's 24x zoom - however after finding and reading the manual on the Panasonic site - I found that there is a way to go into the EZ setting (Extra Zoom) that gives me a 60.3x zoom !!!

It doesn't do everything, but it comes close. It isn't \"the absolute best\" in any one category, but it is at least \"very good plus\" in the categories that matter most to a lot of folks: stills, video, zoom range, shooting performance, image stabilization, battery life. It has a mid-level Electronic Viewfinder that can save your cookies in bright sunlight, and a very good wide viewing angle LCD for general shooting purposes.The notion of a bridge camera is broad and vague: it can mean just about whatever you want it to. It seeks to fill the gap between a shirt pocket point and shoot snapshot camera and a larger, heavier, more expensive DSLR system camera. At one time, the pocket camera was something like my old Canon Powershot A610, a 4X zoom 5 megapixel camera powered by four AA batteries, with a diminutive two inch articulated, low resolution LCD display and an inaccurate optical viewfinder. Back in its day, it was considered living large by many, including myself. The \"5-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 13 x 17-inch prints\" as was the ad-brag back then. In 2005, it carried a $299 retail price: a bargain at $100 less than the Canon A95 it replaced from a year prior, with its zoom increasing from 3-4x and its 2 inch LCD generous compared to the A95's 1.8 inch screen. While the A95 took 30-second video clips of 640 by 480 pixels in size and ten frames per second, the A610  grabs 640 by 480 at 30fps until you ran out of memory card or battery. The A610 was a bit over three quarters of a pound in operation.We've moved on from the dark ages of 2005, to the point where the old Canon A610 now isn't considered pocketable or to some folks, even usable. Shutter lag was .6 seconds or so, with shot to shot cycle time of about 1.1 seconds, with flash recycle time of about 5 seconds or so. This camera today looks like a crude, expensive contraption compared to the lighter and more pocketable long zoom cameras such as the Canon SX230 / SX260 / SX280 group, and the Panasonic ZS-15 / ZS-20.The basis for selecting the Lumix DMC-FZ60K is not to displace the comparatively inconspicuous pocketable travel zoom genre of camera, nor is it even to seek the best image quality regardless of price. The motivation here is an upcoming trip back to South Africa, and the desire to carry one affordable optical unit with good battery life replacing what I might otherwise carry: a Panasonic ZS-15, an LX7, and a dedicated video camera  with one unit of practical size, weight, and zoom.The approximately $290 street price 24x optical / 48x \"Intelligent Zoom\" FZ60K is very close in operation and envelope dimensions to the more celebrated Panasonic FZ200 (about $490 street). In fact, they both share the same owners manuals. The decision was made to go with the FZ60K on the basis of its lighter weight, smaller bulk, and smaller price than the FZ200, the Canon SX50, or the Sony HX200V. The Sony, as of this writing, is about $60 more, has a 30x zoom, but it was the Canon SX50 for about an extra $80 - $100 that offered the most appeal with its whopping 50x optical zoom capability. Actually, for some, the Canon may be the better choice. For me, it wasn't, despite the Canon's superior zoom range, RAW capability, and articulated screen. It was close, but the Canon lost out due to its approximately one third heavier weight, extra bulk, slightly slower lens, and weaker battery life (CIPA 310 shots). The primary stopper for me was the choppy 1080/24p video capability of the Canon compared to the 1080i60 capability of the FZ60. If HD video is of little interest to you, the Canon might well be your choice, at least until the FZ70 Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black) becomes available: the apparent winner in zoom wars.There is a theory of image quality that holds that the higher pixel density, the less light each photosite can get, and overall image quality suffers. While the cleanest, sharpest pictures are certainly related to the largest sensor with the lowest pixel density along with the brightest lens, the reality is that there is a lot more to it than that. The FZ60 has a dinky 17.5 megapixels photo receptor 1/2.33 CMOS with an effective 16.1 MP ability, so you might think that spells doom for critical image quality. In this case, thankfully it is not so, and of note is that some makers such as Sony don't subscribe to this at all, for their HX200V sports an 18.2 MP sensor (18.9 MP photo-sites) on the same postage stamp sized 1/2.33 sensor . . . a whopping 20.4 MP on their forthcoming HX50 travel zoom. There is no doubt a limit to pixel density than can be effectively used, but it isn't an exact science nor readily apparent. High pixel cameras are apparently effective primarily for marketing, but as long as the images meet your personal standards of quality you do have more room to crop your photos after the fact, while still retaining enough image size to give you enough pixels per inch to do a 16 x 24 inch poster. Based on viewing distance, even a 5 MP image may net you 108 ppi, more than the 80 ppi often designated as needed.Panasonic has priced the FZ60 two hundred dollars less than their flagship FZ200 to make the FZ60 either the best on the market in the \"price performance\" ratio, or worthless depending on your needs and budget. If you need RAW, an articulated screen, a higher resolution electronic viewfinder, or are shooting regularly at full zoom under dim light . . . the FZ200 will empty another two hundred dollars from your wallet instantly, and you'll likely feel richer despite your thinner wallet. None of these are of great importance to me, for other cameras (LX-7) handily exceed the no flash, low light, low noise capabilities of any long-zoom bridge camera if that is requisite for the application. In the vast majority of outdoor still and video uses, you won't be able to tell the difference on any 8 x 10 framed print, much less a website image.The FZ60 24x zoom lens has a 35mm equivalent range of 25-600mm , starts out at an F2.8 aperture, slows to F4.1 at 300m, and finishes up at F5.6. It invariably lets a bit more light through than the 16x Panasonic ZS-15 (F3.3 - F5.9) and the 20x Panasonic ZS-20 (F3.3 - F6.4). Its battery life of 450 shots dwarfs the 260 shots of the ZS-15 and the 230 shots of the pocket long zoom Canon SX260 as well.It isn't all rosy with the FZ60, however. While Panasonic touts the 10 fps (frames per second) in 16.1-megapixel full resolution capability of this camera, it isn't happening. No way is anyone going to get ten frames per second at full resolution: two or three is it. It is one of the obvious problems when you start moving large files around; if you are hoping for machine gun 16.1 image burst shooting with this camera, you can forget it.What this camera offers, despite its $280 - $290 acquisition cost, over a shirt-pocket long zoom is an included external charger that saves you a few pesos against the slow, in-camera charging of several compacts, a color electronic viewfinder (202K), longer battery life, and manual focusing ability needed for cutting through brush, grass, and foliage. The flash unit is more powerful than many compacts; the 24x zoom is a fifty percent jump from the ZS-15 and similarly specified cameras. Some will find the larger size of the FZ60 far easier to hold steady than some of the flyweight pocket cameras, and it does retain the industry-leading Panasonic Intelligent Auto mode, generally peppy autofocus, start-up time, very good optical image stabilization, and brisk shooting performance. It adds eight new filter option special effects to the Lumix platform: the star effect and one point color are the most interesting.Although a bridge camera can just as well be called a compromise camera, at this price point ($283.52 delivered in my case) there isn't much to carp about, for its image quality is noticeably better than the competitively priced Nikon P510, Fuji HS30EXR, and the more expensive Sony HX200V. Although a jump in price, the Canon SX40 with its 50X lens is quite worthy of your consideration, especially if video frame rate at 1080p is not important to you, and you typically shoot with a tripod. You might call the FZ60 a stripper version of the FZ200, but the strip in price far exceeds overall camera performance in favor of the FZ60.For a camera bag that offers plenty of room for quick retrieval and replacement of the camera, I like the Case Logic DCB-305 \"Camcorder Kit Bag.\"Case Logic DCB-305 Camcorder Kit Bag - Black Another bag that fits, but fits the FZ-60 quite snuggly is the Lowepro \"Edit 100 Bag.\" If you want a bag that allows no movement at all, you'll want the Lowepro but I'm happier with the Case Logic overall. Rather than getting soaked for extra Chinese batteries with the official Panasonic logo, I picked up a pair of the \"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ47 DMC-FZ150 Digital Camera Battery - Premium DMW-BMB9 Battery\" generic batteries, allegedly 1200mAh meaning higher capacity than OEM. They charge right up in the Panasonic charger and work beautifully in the FZ-60, with at least as good of operating life as the supplied battery.There are plenty of manual controls to satisfy most folks on the FZ-60. I shoot in 14M, 3:2 aspect ratio for the most part as it matches the three inch LCD's dimensions. In \"IA\" mode, indoors, low light, rarely would the camera shoot at more than ISO 400. Though the burst mode isn't much of a burst at all, the camera is speedy enough that you won't find yourself waiting between shots, the flash recycles quickly as well, and the video is just as bright as the stills with ambient lighting.I did do some side by side comparisons of the FZ60 against the Panasonic ZS-15 pocket zoom that uses the same sensor as the well-received FZ150 Panasonic 24x bridge model. A few things were easily discerned: the FZ60 LCD is far better, with essentially unlimited viewing angles, though both are 460K resolution. The FZ60, despite its sensor's higher pixel density, delivers sharper, clearer images. Where 16x images taken indoors across the room in dim lighting were shot at ISO 400 with both cameras, the aperture dimmed to F5.9 in the ZS-15 vs. F4.2 with the FZ-60.The FZ60, perhaps due to its carefully polished plastic body made by Old World Craftsmen is lighter than you might think in field use.Consider that a well-regarded DSLR lens alone, the Nikon AF Zoom-Nikkor 80-200mm, runs a thousand dollars or so, gets close to three pounds, yet cannot compete with the utility of the FZ60's 25-600mm zoom range.  The Intelligent Zoom feature, though not strictly as good as straight optical zoom, is a lot more than just a gimmick.I've uploaded a rabbit taken at 48 times zoom at sunset, handheld, just as it came out of the camera, along with a 48x goose and red-winged blackbird as well, all taken hand-held, as well as a macro image of a toad. Additionally, I've uploaded a few images taken during a recent safari to South Africa, that shows off this camera's field capabilities a bit.To sum up the FZ60, I'll call it \"very good plus\" in most every way. Very good plus images, very good plus video, very good plus shooting performance, very good plus LCD screen, very good plus battery life. It is fun to shoot with and is as close as you can get to an all-in-one outdoors still image and video acquisition system for $285 in a one pound package.Copyright 2013 by Randy Wakeman and randywakeman.com .", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE", "Author": "Rachael", "ReviewID": "R1WLPIL4XKJHI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently enrolled in a digital photography class and have fallen in love with this camera.

Snyder", "ReviewID": "RWG9FA9X594KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been talking pictures for 20 years. I have had point and shoot cameras for about the last 10 years. Recently my fuji 24x zoom camera broke for no reason after a little more than a year (of course!). Angry I went back to Nikkon and got a great deal on Nikon COOLPIX P510 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom. I really wanted to like that camera because I trusted the name and I wanted all that 42x zoom. It just lagged too much for me. I had to wait too long for the focus, the flash, and to take the next picture. What they don't tell you about long zoom lenses is that they require so much light at extended ranges, making anything past 15x inside useless. The killer for me was that its movie files are in Quicktime format (.mov) and I HATE dealing with crapple software. That prevented me from also trying Cannon's comprable point and shoot.And so I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60K 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom two weeks ago. Never tried a panasonic camera or knew they made cameras, but I had heard of Leica and was impressed that they made the lens. The camera was light weight, yet solid feeling in my hand. Everything is quicker, more responsive about this camera: The autofocus begins as soon as you touch the shutter button. No halfway to focus. When you take a picture, its ready to take the next one right away. The flash reloads fast. Although the zoom on this camera is not what others are, its usable magnification. I took a picture inside my house in my dark living room of something in my lit kitchen zoomed all the way and the picture was sharp, focused, and properly exposed. I can't back this up with technical specs, but it seems like this lens lets in more light then the other cameras.I have taken some MPEGs but haven't viewed them on anything bigger than the camera screen. I haven't tried the other modes, but there is lots to choose from. But I do know that this camera performs faster at taking pictures in auto mode than any other camera I have tried. There is a big race on between the camera companies to crank out the next camera with the longest zoom, even panasonic has a newer model (without the Leica lens) that has a longer zoom. There is a reason the zoom lenses on expensive SLRs are so wide, it is to allow for more light. There may be 50x or 42x zoom cameras out there, but you can only use all of that magnification if your shooting in bright sunny lighting.Try this camera. You won't send it back.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lumix DMC- FZ60", "Author": "J. M. Becker", "ReviewID": "R2PWO1LRT6KT5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 3 weeks with this camera I can absolutely recommend it as probably the best all-around camera of this type.I was in search of a fast long zoom \"bridge\" camera after getting a Kodak Z990 8 months ago that took , what I thought at the time, was great pix. I researched and bought this Panasonic. I compared to all the other cameras in this genre that i could, including trying them at the stores. (this camera wasn't available locally so it was a case of hoping/researching) .After having the long zoom experience with the Kodak I wanted a long zoom but was dis-appointed with the Kodak's very erratic focusing, very slow performance when shooting and the occasional lock-up. All this was causing too many missed shots and increasing frustration !I just didn't want to have that be the \"norm\" for these \"smaller sensor\", long zoom type of camera.This camera restored my appreciation of this style camera!.The performance is great . The time to first shot, shudder lag/writing to memory is extremely quick and the auto focus is very quick and accurate. Out of 10 quick shots on different types of moving/not quite stationary  (eg. pets/kids) maybe 2 aren't perfect ! This was, like i said, very quick/ fast as possible between shots so that is great when trying to catch those elusive shots that you will usually only get 1 chance to capture.After experimenting with the auto settings and almost all the custom modes/settings I have found that the auto settings will deliver great pix as advertised but I prefer using the \"P\" mode, applying a +1 for sharpness and color, -1 for noise reduction and place an upper ISO limit of 400 to control noise and maintain a nice sharp picture. Even inside ( with flash at that max ISO ) these settings are good for my tastes.There are adjustments for just about everything and experimentation will reveal a setting that is perfect for your taste and then you can save that as a custom mode that you can recall at will !!The built in picture enhancements are fun and can also make some darker pix be enhanced and much improved.There is a \"Hand-Held Night Shot\" mode that is great for dark shots without the flash.I did not buy this for video recording but I did try it and the quality is as good as the reviews said! Will be handy if a situation comes up that I need video but I am caught with out the video camera.The battery is good for at least 350+ shots (depending on flash/zoom use) and charges quickly.The only slight limitations of this camera  (and all of this type ) are slightly slowed focusing in dark scenes and at extreme zooms (again, limitations of the sensors ) and this camera has some focusing options to help get the occasionally hard to focus subject focused properly!If you are looking for a camera with the zoom ability ( this camera, with the proper set-up, has  an enhanced, not digital, zoom of 48x with out visible image problems ) I recommend this camera, especially at the current, less than  $300.00 price.To get better pictures or performance you would have to make the jump to a full-fledged DSL camera/extra zoom lens combo that is at least 3x the price of this handy camera.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Longtime Panasonic FZ user", "Author": "King Lerch", "ReviewID": "R33HWNPUGKQW61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love these Panasonic FZ style cameras. They have great zoom, great features, and are not too big/heavy. I have previously owned the FZ5 and FZ8. This FZ60 is a huge step above these. I took it on safari in South Africa and took 3200 pictures. I would point on the animal, hold the button, and let'r rip. I went the entire 8+ hour day of shooting without having to change the battery even once. Even took some videos that came out great.The best performance for this camera came when we saw lions amazingly far away. They looked like rocks from a distance of several hundred feet. But with the 24x, I was able to get fairly close fotos. Zooming in further, or copping if you will, let me see expressions on the tiny lion cub. At this level there are compression artifacts, but it is difficult to explain just how far away these images were. The FZ60 turned what would have been a \"no picture possible\" moment into some really decent fotos. The exposure was a little confusing for me, how the camera determined the proper exposure. It wasn't difficult with that thumb wheel to adjust the exposure, but when shooting an animal with trees around and sky behind, the exposure results varied greatly depending on where I ended up pointing. There are several exposure settings including bracketing, but I didn't try them all to find out which one was best.The Program AE mode worked the best for me. I did use the Shutter mode sometimes too, and it works great to tell you how much time you will need to keep the shutter open for a photograph in the darkness at your desired ISO setting. The Aperture mode is not as useful since you can't use the full aperture while zooming and changes in aperture at this level seem to do almost nothing. Maybe if I took more \"non-zoomed\" fotos this mode would make a difference. I tried Auto mode, which tries to determine the best setting for my scene, but generally the results were not as good as Program AE. I also love that you can turn down the flash intensity because the lowest flash setting is better in almost all circumstances than something brighter, which can kill so many indoor shots.For scene modes, I used the Panorama mode, but while a little interesting the definition was not great. The Sunset mode was very nice. I also tried the Handheld Night shot mode, which takes several photos and only keeps the one with the most clarity. I found this not to be *that* great, and preferred to take my own series of shots and choose the best one myself. There are 3 burst modes, 2FPS, 5FPS, and 10FPS, each with or without continual refocus on each shot. I used the 2FPS mode because although slower, the manual isn't clear that the other modes will sacrifice resolution for faster shots.The size and weight are great, even for hanging on a belt. I bought the Lowepro Edit 100 case after trying many that were too big or too small. This one worked perfectly for this camera. Generally, cases for this type of camera are difficult to find with a good fit. So while there are some imperfections in this camera, most of them are necessary due to the size and price. The FZ200 does a better job at a higher cost/size/weight.

It does fine with the MP4 format.- Viewfinder needs to be higher resolution.

I love my DSLRs but sometimes I just don't want to worry about them so I wanted a point and shoot to carry around at times but it had to be something better than the traditional point and shoot. I think I found it with this camera. I love the longer zoom on it and the start up time is great. It has a nice set of filters and settings. I can also use it all day without the battery dying but it did require me charging it every night of our last vacation to Myrtle Beach. I think for our next trip to Disney I'm going to take an extra battery with me for the days I don't carry my DSLR since I tend to take a lot more pictures there.So, the most important thing is the picture quality. I have to say that it's pretty decent. It's not dslr quality but I never expected it would be. It is the closest to dslr quality that I've had with a point and shoot. I can get really nice color and sharpness even when using the fully automatic mode. When using the special setting such as panoramic the quality of picture is also nice and it's really simple to use. It's exactly what I want in a point and shoot and I feel the price was good for the camera I got.One last note, this camera is thicker that a traditional point and shoot. I knew that buying it buy apparently my husband didn't. It's not a large camera by any means but it isn't one that will fit in your pocket. For me it's a good compromise between a traditional P&S; and a DSLR. It will never replace my dslr but at least now I don't feel like I'm losing out on a decent picture if I don't take it with me.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better image quality than FZ47", "Author": "Detroit4ever", "ReviewID": "R26V1KVK77JUO7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had owned the Lumix FZ47 and it was a great camera.  Although, anything beyond ISO 400 showed a good deal of noise, which I probably par with a 1/2sensor.  The FZ60 uses a CMOS sensor compared to the CCD of the FZ47 and I feel this provides a better image!  The video on the FZ 60 is much better than the FZ47.  This is a very good camera and produces nice images.  Low Light situations are challenging, as to be expected.  I'm messing with the settings to combat the problem.  I think this camera does a good job across the board.  I wish that Panasonic would add a larger sensor to this line.  A larger sensor in this camera would make it a AWESOME.  I was surprised to see so little information on the web related to the FZ60, perhaps it there just wasn't enough to separate it from the FZ47.  This is a decent camera and I recommend it, especially if the price drops to below $299.99!!", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60", "Author": "Marshal Shlafer", "ReviewID": "R3MGECSNUH7YOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it!  Bought this after checking out the Nikon P510 (and a newer comparable model) and the FZ200. Price was right. Have been using Nikon pro-level SLRs (film) and digital for as long as I can remember, wanted something smaller/lighter for those times when I don't want to lug around a larger body.The Lumix is great. Many features, accessing them using menu system quite intuitive, or at least easily accomplished with a quick check of the \"advanced features\" manual/file (downloaded as PDF). The Leica lens is quite sharp, reasonably fast. I don't have anything but favorable things to say re: lens sharpness, freedom from distortion, and so on. I suspect that although the lens is marked Leica, optically it's probably not on par with more advanced Leica lenses, and I doubt Leica would harm its reputation by putting out a bad lens with their brand name on it.One major limitation (at least for me): No RAW file output. Nonetheless, the hi-res JPEG images are great, so long as you don't keep editing and repeatedly saving the edited files. (Edit copies of the JPEGs, not the originals.)Low light focusing a bit slow, but nothing insurmountable, although none of the 100+ photos I took the first weekend the camera was in my possession were of fast action. Zooming in or out seems sort of tentative: zoom goes slowly at first, then suddenly (it seems) continues to zoom in or out as operator desired.  The lens might actually benefit from slower but less tentative or jerky changes of focal lenght.Viewfinder (as opposed to LCD, to which one can easily switch) takes a bit of getting used to, as once a photo is taken the stilled image of the photo remains in the viewfinder for several moments before returning to a live view. The nature of the beast, I guess. On the other hand, there seemed to be exceedingly little shutter lag.One reason why I opted for this as opposed to, say, the Nikon Coolpix P510, is that the front of the lens is threaded for various photo filters, the most important of which to me is a polarizer. Sadly, and it was a deal-braker for me re: the Nikon, the Coolpix lacked filter threads on the front of the lens. And, unfortunately (and in contrast with the FZ60's more expensive sibling, the 200), no lens shade was provided. However, appropriately sized snap on hoods are readily available and for not much money.While I said I was pleased that the Leica lens has front threads for filters (whereas the Nikon does not), I should mention that I think the threads on the FZ-60 weren't deep enough. A polarizing filter indeed screws on, but if rotating it counterclockwise the shallow threads make it easy for the filter to unscrew completely and fall if not being held securely..The Lumix IS light, and although I have somewhat large hands, it poses no problems with grip or manipulating the controls.In short, I'm highly pleased with this little Lumix, especially considering its feature set and the price. I can't think of (nor have found) any issues with this camera that would lead me to give it a poorer recommendation. Indeed, I probably short-changed the camera with a 4 star rating.

I have several of them in addition to my new FZ60 (e.g., ZS19, ZS9, FZ 28, FZ40, etc) and am enthusiastic about the soon-to-be-released FZ70. Additionally, I own a Canon SX40, a Sony HX20V, and a Nikon P510. I love photography and a photo that emulates an SLR as much as possible--without the time, energy & finances they demand.I am pretty much the go-to person for recording all kinds of events from bees buzzing around my hydrangeas to parties to karaoke night and live music events at my local pub, so I need a camera that is up to the task even when \"setting up a shot\" is not possible. The FZ60 is a high quality point and shoot with lots of tasty features that will occupy any photo hobbyist. It takes amazing portraits and macros with little effort and the response time is exceptional. It shoots almost as swiftly as if I'm using the burst feature and even when using flash, is surprisingly speedy (definitely not so with the SX40, with which the word \"Busy\" appears much too frequently for my tastes).The FZ60 also has in-camera creative options (having the most fun especially with the 1-color feature).  I'm surprised that some people say there is noise on the zoom when shooting video because I haven't really noticed it and I've shot video in a variety of circumstances ranging from silent to loud.

Panoramic photos, better low light shots, and you can take a number of pictures just by holding the shutter button down and when your done shooting just delete the shots you don't like.

For the record, I only ordered a used / warehouse deals camera because I thought it was considered part of Amazon and therefore I would be guaranteed to receive a US market, non-gray market item.As of right now, you cannot purchase this camera directly from Amazon at all. I actually quite liked the camera, but will not buy electronics with an invalid warranty. It appears that the third party sellers are allowed to sell gray market items, but Amazon should really be forcing them (and Warehouse Deals) to make it clear that the manufacturers will NOT honor a warranty for these gray market cameras.

When I'm holding this camera, it feels like a camera and all of the buttons are easily accessible while secure in my grip.- The battery life seems to be amazing.  I shot 400 pictures with some video footage as well and still did not even come close to running out of battery.- The picture quality is superb.  When I was in automatic mode, all of my pictures came out crisp and clear.  They were beautiful on my computer and beautiful when printed.  I did some editing on some with an online software and they didn't have much work to do when it came to 'auto adjusting' the pictures.- The zoom is awesome. We went to a baseball game at Target Stadium and sat in the 306 section (look it up, it's WAY up there) and I was able to take pictures of the players that made it look like I was right on the field.  I was able to zoom in close enough to capture the players names and numbers on their shirts very clearly and the quality of the picture did not seem to be affected.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't tried to blow any of these up bigger than 4x6 but they look amazing on the computer and in the 4x6 printed size.  I read a few reviews where there were complaints about the length of time it took the camera to refocus when zooming in to this degree... Did it take some time? Yes.  Was it worth it the wait?  Yes.  Are you going to be able to turn this camera on, whip it up, zoom it in and take a picture of something that is fast moving? Probably not, but if you're already zoomed to the distance you want, it only takes a second to refocus.  In my opinion, the quality of the zoom outweighed the time it took to focus.- Starting to record a video is a simple on step process.  One button, push and your recording.  If you are zoomed in, it records from the zoom position you are in.  Oh, and you can still snap pictures while the video is recording.A couple of things I didn't love (this list IS all inclusive at this time) -- I can't tell what is video when I'm reviewing the pictures on the camera.  I enlisted the help of a friend who has more camera knowledge than I and she finally found it.  The only difference seems to be that the picture (1st frame of the video) is a little different shape than the pictures... Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that this is the only way to make the determination, but it's the only way I have found so far.- The video files are in some cryptic file that my computer doesn't really know how to handle.  That being said, I have not downloaded my pictures to the computer that I have the software on.  I have another laptop that reads SD cards and have just inserted the card and moved the pictures that way.  I'm guessing that the software has something to convert these files, but I rarely use that computer (and can't put the software on the computer I do use) so it has been inconvenient for now.  I really don't know if this would affect someone who uploaded the pictures using the included software.One last note about the camera - I showed some of my pictures to a friend who is a photographer for a small town paper and other assorted media affairs and she was quite impressed with the quality.All the other bells, whistles and manual modes?  I've tried some of them but can't really speak to them because I have no idea what I was really doing, but I can say that they all seemed to work :)", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality.

This seller only deserves ONE star, and Amazon itself deserves the same!------First update on August 19, 2013 to the original review (below):I received an email from Panasonic headquarters today, saying that this product had no English manual because it was manufactured for South America, and not for North America. Panasonic seems to be saying this is one of those \"grey market\" products, and they also say in their email that they will NOT warranty the camera at all!. The seller was \"Photo Savings\" and they seem to be highly rated on Amazon, but I can't give them more than three stars because they should have known the camera was not to be sold in the U.S. The way you can TELL if a Panasonic camera is valid for the U.S., is to look at the product code on the box the camera is in. If the code is \"P\", then it is a valid product, but if it is \"PU\" (which my camera was), then it is made for South America and its warranty will not be valid).

I was finally able to get Panasonic to give me the correct website for downloading the English manual, but this is ridiculous....most people need a small paper manual to take with them when they're using a complex digital camera like this, and Panasonic does not provide one, or at least not for free!I own two other Panasonic digital cameras and they both came with a paper manual in addition with the CD manual.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R1GLMSY5HYEGNV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Lumix previously and this is a replacement because it quit working after it got wet.

My intent was to purchase a point-and-shoot camera with an electronic viewfinder.  Unfortunately, much to my chagrin, it is extremely difficult to find such a camera today without spending $350+++.  I reviewed Panasonic, Canon, Fuji, and Olympus options before deciding on the FZ60.It is much too soon to render a complete review at this point.  All I can say is that the camera appears to be much better than my previous camera which was the Kodak Easyshare Z8612IS, a camera I purchased more than 5 years ago.  I have been through the user guide provided with the camera, although it is an abbreviated guide at best. The complete guide is available for download, which I did for my iPad.  It is one I will most likely review several times due to the extensive array of features offered by Panasonic.The one question I have at the moment concerns the flash function.  I spoke with a Panasonic customer service representative about this, as well as a couple of other points, but was still confused.  The representative seemed to imply that the pop-up flash must be open for the flash to function, even in the auto flash mode.  This seems counter intuitive to me.  I would think that the flash would automatically pop up from the closed position if the camera, both in the P and IA modes, deems the flash as necessary.  If this is not the case, I guess it means that I must always keep the pop-up flash open at all times, which again seems contradictory to an auto flash mode.

The red movie button on the top seems eratic both beginning & stopping a movie, sometimes does not work for me so I prefer to use the main dial for movie mode, also the on/off lever feels as if 1 day it will snap!Since writing the above I have definitely found the buttons on the back a problem, touching them without trying, & the design of the body with a space for your thumb.........you need deformed hands to use it, that's probably why I touch the buttons accidentally, the auto focus does not focus on the object always, sometimes on something in front of it to the side instead, I've tried changing the focus modes to no avail.OTHER GRIPES...............NO MOVABLE SCREEN, also the lens cover..............problems getting off & on!The zoom lens works well in low light, & now have made good movies & shot reasonable photos in Auto mode. The stills are OK but I expected more, especially using the Zoom the camera does not auto-focus well in my opinion. Another big gripe as has been stated in all reviews is the lack of any extended time mode. I used to like shooting the night sky, also movement of speed shots, not possible at all.I have owned 2 Olympus cameras previously & both were better thought out body-wise, also allowed night shots etc.I did think about sending it back but shall continue in my quest for excellence because what else is available?So to sum up..........GOODValue for money & features compared with competitors, I spent days researching them all.Has a viewfinder.Some/most photos are good.Movies.Battery life.BADStills focusing. On one menu option it has various so-called focus points outlined together, who wants that, I just want to focus on the main object?If I could I would post examples but not sure you can with comments?No extended exposure.Instructions.UGLYBody design & button placement.Panasonic website/sites, although they do respond quickly.THIS WAS MY 1ST COMMENT! Panasonic have changed their website since!?I received the camera OK but there is no manual.I went to Panasonic.eu, downloaded the manual, printed it.............over 200 pages only to find the downloaded FZ62 manual had different functions to the actual camera received. So I went back to Panasonic, registered it as OTHER because there is not a FZ62 showing then looked for another manual. I found a manual with the FZ62 I had but it also has the FZ200 which means spending ages separating the pages because they are not separate but mixed together.I decided to complain to Panasonic............on the form for contacting Panasonic Customer Services.eu they only have USA States so I had to choose WYOMING to get it sent!The manual problem is scandelous, BE WARNED IN ADVANCE you only receive a very basic paper instruction leaflet included with the camera.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "Blondie", "ReviewID": "R1Y5IV7TDWLED9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A professional photographer recommended this camera.

Please go to this link for a detailed review. This camera is the same as DMC-FZ62 sold in Europe and AustraliaWhatdigitalcamera.comAlthough the review did not mention anything about the low light capability, I gathered by looking at the Panasonic catalog that the sensitivity will be as good as if not better than the DMC-ZS15. Neither did the review compare this camera with last year's DMC-FZ47 but with a new 16 megapixel sensor and a new Venus processor, the image quality and noise reduction should be better (except at higher ISO). I had the DMC-FZ47 for a short time last year before I sold it to friend and I thought it was a good camera except for the noise and a mediocre low light performance - doesn't everybody wants to take pictures without using the flash.Performance wise, this is definitely not as good as the DMC-FZ200, but for those on a budget you definitely get your moneys worth.I'll update my comment and probably my rating to 5 stars as I find more reviews.8/27 Update:Cameralabs.com just did a detailed review (so did Photographyblog.com). Although the unit tested is a pre production model with a firmware version 0.20 (actual production model incorporates firmware version 1.00). Test shows it produces great quality images and exhibits a pleasingly natural tonal range and guess what - it excels in low light, but lags behind DMC-FZ47 in continuous or burst shooting. Maximum continuous shooting speed only works for three shots which is just fine for my own needs. Cameralabs.com & Photographyblog.com gave it a \"Recommended\" rating.I'm not a professional photographer so based on my own personal needs and the price of $349. which will eventually go down, I think this camera is one of the lowest value for your money.

It is big -- too big even for a day pack, much less a handbag.  Moreover, it doesn't come with that nice little leather case the Canon was packaged in, so the big camera has to go in an even bigger case. Given what I read about Panasonic warranties and the flimsy lens cover, going without a case seems very risky. Seems like it would require two hands to hold and operate, and I'm frequently shooting with just one free hand.  Realized just the size was going to keep me from taking most of the impromptu shots I take of grandchildren or on vacations.Yes, I could zoom across my backyard and get a fabulous close up of a new robin's nest, but how often would I do that?It does not come with a memory card, so be sure you have one when it arrives and you want to try it out.
