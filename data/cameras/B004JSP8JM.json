Some have criticized it for the hard-to close waterproof latches, but I didn't have any problems with that. I also followed the suggestion of putting a little chap-stik on the seals to make sure to keep the water out. From a water proof perspective, it worked flawlessly, and we have both photos and video from under water on our vacation.The camera has lots of settings to experiment with, but we used it mostly on the \"automatic\" settings, with the exception of some sunrise/sunset photos. All the pictures came out well enough for snapshots, but there are certainly better cameras when it comes to image quality.The difference between video recording times in standard vs high quality is pretty significant. 30 minutes for standard, and about 12 for HD.For what I needed (inexpensive underwater camera), I am very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely horrible for it's advertised useage", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RW88GX6995PT4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I competed in a Tough Mudder challenge this weekend and wanted to get a camera to document my adventure that would be able to handle getting submerged in water a few times and still let me get some pictures or video of the fun.I carried this in my hand or in the side pocket of my shorts throughout the 10 miles on the mountain and it spent approximately 15 minutes max being submerged in water, and got wet (water splashed onto it or onto me) several more times. It's rated to be *waterproof* to at least 10ft (I think the data sheet says 14.9) so I figured never going more than 6ft in water should be fine. I was terribly wrong on that point.After the first time crawling through muddy water on my belly (12\" deep) with the camera in my pocket, its lens was fogged up and it wouldn't turn on. I pulled it out again later and it turned on, took a couple of videos and pictures, but the LCD on the back was fogged and appeared to have water inside, but the lens was now clear. I was already concerned at this point but shouldn't have been, as it never worked again!CONS:Almost everything regarding its toughness. I followed every instruction and it had water inside from the first few moments of getting wet, there are no rubber seals or gaskets around the battery/SD card compartment, nothing to tighten down to make sure it's sealed, just a tiny latch/switch that you have to make sure is locked (which I did).Not waterproof, this is completely false. I got so much water inside it that I do not think I will be able to pull the few images I think were taken off of the memory card.Please, if you are going to do anything remotely active that involves more than a few ounces of water, DO NOT buy this camera. I'll be testing out Costco's return policy as I am going to take this thing back tomorrow. If anyone finds a decent priced point and shoot that is waterproof, please respond here. I think I will be getting the Go Pro HD next, tons of folks had those and had no issues with them.PROS:It came with a spiffy case.

Remember: megapixels don't mean squat if you don't have a decent lens, auto-focus system, processor, memory card, etc.  If I had to do it again would buy a disposable waterproof digital for the day at the park, or shell out the extra bucks for a better waterproof camera.  On the plus side, the video is OK, and it's pretty cool to be able to take video underwater at the pool.

The camera buttons started to work again and I thought this fixed the \"sand\" problem.

Then I took it underwater at the beach (and I did not drop it in the sand again), the buttons began to stick again and water began to leak in the lens and LCD screen.  I have dried the camera out thinking this might correct the problem (I try to think positive), but now the camera no longer works at all.

However, for my trip to hawaii it was perfect. I didn't want to spend a lot and I loved the look of it and it worked very well underwater. I didn't have any problem with leakage; as long as you check very carefully that everything is secure it shouldn't be an issue. I took it snorkeling several times, including at night with manta rays. My video quality wasn't the best but it was decent and definitely worth the buy to have it over nothing. I also took it ziplining with me which was perfect as it was raining. The only complaint I have is that you can hear the zooming in and out in the video and there was a lot of \"noise\" as well, but I suppose underwater audio can only be so good. If you want a camera for every day use I would NOT suggest you buy this.  If you are going on a trip where the camera could get wet this is a good purchase. Really the only con was I was always worried water would get in, It didn't but I was worried after reading all the reviews.
