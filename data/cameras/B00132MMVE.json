{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kodak is making great cameras again", "Author": "Loren", "ReviewID": "R2MBNO9784MUTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I wanted a new camera, my first thought was one of the Japanese trinity: Canon, Nikon or Sony. I first got into Kodak almost by accident: we went on a trip and left our camera at home so I bought a V603 P&S; on sale at Walmart. Loved it immediately! Crisp, bright pictures and several extras, like panorama shots and \"perfect touch\" one click editing that I found indispensable after awhile.So when I wanted a bigger camera, I started looking at Kodak. I first saw the Kodak Z812IS, but when I saw the Z1012, I went for it. I've not been disappointed. I know that Kodak has made some dogs in the past few years, but I think you'll find this an excellent camera, and you'll like it even better if you're taking price into consideration.Like others here have said, I ding it on battery life. You absolutely must get the charger and at least three rechargeable lithium batteries. Don't be confused when it says there's a lithium battery included in the kit: that's a one-use lithium, not a rechargeable.Two more things about batteries: #1. The klic-8000 battery is the shape of two AA's. You can't use alkalines - they dip below peak current too quickly - but you can use the regular lithium AA's that you see in stores. It's an expensive way to go compared to rechargeables, but it works in a pinch. #2. Don't buy Kodak brand klic-8000's. There are some good aftermarket li-ions of the same size that are considerable cheaper and work just as well.As for performance, you'll be pleased. The \"smart\" mode (S on the dial) works reasonably well, but it takes away all your options except suppressing the flash. Interestingly, smart mode applies the \"perfect touch\" editing automatically, and it usually results in a good picture. I often use it.Mostly, though I switch to the \"P\" setting, which is a programmed setting with just a few more options, like lighter or darker. Honestly, for most of us, the shutter priority and aperture priority, much less the manual setup, will hardly ever be needed. If you're such a good photographer than you need them frequently, you're probably beyond a camera like this and already have a SLR. They're a selling point, though, and you can hardly imagine a $200+ camera that would dare to leave those features out.You might be tempted by the 18X lenses on a few other brands in this camera configuration, but I think you'll be surprised at how much you get out of a 12X lens. Also, unlike all the digital cameras I've ever had, the digital zoom actually works very well. Obviously you get fewer pixels, but what you get is remarkably sharp, and you need make no apologies. That's probably why they call it \"advanced digital zoom\".This model makes panoramas easy, and there's a big advantage to doing them in the camera: it locks the same settings for the whole panorama, so there's no line between frames as there is when you take three separate pictures and stitch them. The stitching \"engine\" is amazingly good.And yes, there is HD video, and it looks pretty nice, but don't expect it to replace your video camera. For one thing, sound isn't that great, but what can you expect from tiny microphones behind tiny holes in the camera face? Really, this is a case of not how well the bear dances, but that it can dance at all. And yes, you can zoom while filming.You've probably figured out by now, with these cameras, that there's really not as much flexibility as all the controls and options would make you think there is. To the point: low light pictures will make poor, grainy pictures, with anything short of a tripod, no matter how you set the camera. If you want more capacity in low light, get a high-end SLR.Finally, if you're used to a pocket camera, having this larger thing around your neck will take some getting used to. This camera isn't huge, but it is too big for your shirt pocket. I wish they'd make a small camera with this much lens, but we're not quite there yet - though the (expensive) Canon PowerShot G9 has some wonderful features that make it almost worth giving up some lens power for.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:After using this about 4-5 months, I know a lot more about it than I did at first.My pictures have been, overall, outstanding, on low ISO speeds. Not sure you'll get better anywhere. One thing I've learned is that the pictures are a lot better than they look on the camera. I think Kodak decided to save 50\u00a2 by putting in a lower quality LCD, that really doesn't give you good feedback on picture quality. In fact, the LCD on my old V603 was far better.There are occasional odd freeze-ups that I've had with this camera. It has never stopped working, but I have had to remove the battery once or twice. I also noticed recently that when I use an 8GB card, rendering pictures got really slow, like it had a lot of processing to do. Not sure what that's all about.My biggest annoyance remains the bulk of the camera, after being used to a pocketable camera. I'm looking for a smaller camera to add to the camera bag, such as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP as a pocketable (though not small) camera--I used a friend's and was very impressed. For a very small camera, J.D. Powers has rated the Sony Cybershot T series (such as this Sony Cybershot DSC-T500 10.1MP) very high, though I've not tried it.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Almost a 5-star camera", "Author": "KoiKeeper \"KoiKeeper\"", "ReviewID": "R2XBZ3S1AERN5P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kodak is back on track.This is a real bargain if it holds up for a few years.The Kodak Easyshare Z1012-IS works very well and reliably in normal light.  No auto focus is perfect and this camera is not an exception to that rule.The HD Quick-time movie options work very well. You need 3rd party software to convert Apple Quick-time movies to Windows formats.Extreme Zoom is clear (when it focuses right), but it is a tad less predictable than the regular lens settings. Internal panorama stitching works surprisingly well.Battery life is fair to good (50 to 100 shots per charge).It is easy to figure out most settings and menus.  And it is good that most controls are simple and intuitive as the awful part of this package is the documentation; it is almost nonexistent.If you search the Kodak support site diligently; the in-depth instruction manual can be discovered, but it is not included with the camera, nor is it downloadable.  Its format is FLASH not PDF; (it ought to be on the CD with the Easyshare software).This is a small, light yet powerful and flexible camera, I highly recommend it.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "great point and shoot with high zoom", "Author": "J. A. Jordan \"maine doc\"", "ReviewID": "R30VD8NON1GZ10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera shortly after receiving panasonic 10MP lumix w 12x zoom.  I found out the lumix was as big as my sony digital slr, so I didnt see the point in bringing this on vacation with me.  I also wanted a camera that focused better than the lumix in low light conditions, and this camera does.  I am not totally unbiased, as I had owned 3 other kodak easyshares prior to this, and was happy with their quality, so I bought this kodak the day before traveling to yosemite, napa and san francisco.  I wanted a smaller point and shoot with high zoom for this trip.  I do also own the sony alpha 700 digital slr, but, again it is bulky for traveling, especially with camcorder in the carryon.  The kodak took very good quality pictures and the panoramic function worked very well, joining the images together seamlessly.  It does step the image quality down slightly to use panoramic function, but I was able to stitch my own panoramic using home software with full quality images.  I will be posting some of these images from yosemite and san francisco once I reduce the image sizes.  I would buy this camera again for certain.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Easy to use and great photos", "Author": "Dave from Western NY", "ReviewID": "R23VPWT1Z1OP51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for better photo quality since I do a lot of close up and macro shots.  I am only just getting into the features of this camera but at a recent family event the wide angle and the panoramic shots were really handy.  The panoramic shots are amazing the way the camera stitches the separate shots together.  I really like the camera.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Being Fair", "Author": "A New Mommy", "ReviewID": "R1IDUPX3ZFQH5D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To be fair to this camera, it is good and bad.  It depends on what you're looking for in your camera.I bought this camera in August 2008 and now it's on eBay.  I upgraded from a Kodak C series point and shoot digital and thought this was the logical next step for upgrading to an SLR format.  I also really like the EasyShare software.I was very disappointed with the camera.First of all, do not be decieved by how large this camera looks in the photograph on ANY website.  It is very small and light weight.  Which can go one of two ways depending on what you're looking for.There is no fun clicking sound after you take a shot, no shutter closure, the camera makes more of a hissing sound.  That can take the fun out of taking photos for some people.The lens has a wonderful zoom of 12x optical, but the lens is slow to respond to zoom commands.  The camera is slow overall and often did not turn on quickly when I went to use it.  I had to turn it on and off several times before it was ready to go.The burst mode is horrible, it lags when shooting anything and it freezes up often.  Which is bad news for people shooting children in motion.  Or any wildlife shots.  Even in the special function modes, like sport, etc, it lags and the photos come out blurry.  It's speed performance leaves a lot to be desired and I ended up shooting in automatic mode more often then I wanted to b/c I knew I would miss critical shots if I changed the settings.I used the fireworks setting for shooting fireworks at Walt Disney World and all of the photos ended up blurry.  I was stood as still as I could while the shot was being processed and none of them were usable.  Once I switched to shutter priority and set the shutter speed very low, I was able to capture some nice shots.  So the fireworks setting was useless.10.1 megapixels does not a good camera make.  It's nice to have if you're blowing up shots to the size of a billboard, but otherwise, if you're getting sucked in by the high MP, look elsewhere.  It's just not that important in a camera this small.The f number has a surprisingly high setting at 2.8.  I was able to shoot in apeture priority quite a bit and get some very beautiful macro photos.  The borkeh was beautiful and the depth of field was lovely.  The photos I am most proud of that I took with this camera are the ones shot in apeture priority.Every shot I took in Program mode came back blurry.  Even professional photographers that I know who used P mode couldn't quite get it.  So back to the auto setting.Manual mode was a waste since this zoom lens is too hard to control for manual shots.  It's fine for manual macro shots, but, otherwise, another miss.The Shutter Priority mode is just ok.  Since the camera is really slow overall, it's not much of an improvement to change the shutter priority to anything fast, since it's never really fast at all.  The click to capture best in class award must be a joke.  Seriously, there is no speed with this camera.The flash always fires, even when I had the flash turned off and wanted to shoot in natural light.  That was impossible to overcome.The camera does not come with a battery.  You can expect to purchase an alkaline battery and the recharger separetely.  So the camera does not work out of the box.  You can use regular AA batteries, but they will be drained within a day.  You also have to purchase extra memory cards.  The camera held maybe 20 pictures without the memory card.If you're not into using the viewfinder, then you're in luck since this camera comes equiped with the option to use either the viewfinder or the monitor for picture-taking.The battery life seemed to be fine.  I used it all day on several vacations and trips and even when the battery started to get low, I would turn off the camera and that gave the battery a boost.  It charges up quickly which is a nice turnaround feature.  The small size of the camera is nice for traveling with and easy for carrying around.  It can be mounted to a tripod, if you so desire.The worst part about this camera is the speed of it is just totally lacking.  The additional modes to use are pretty worthless, but it's is nice to have advanced settings (PASM) to experiement with.  You're better off with a regular point and shoot if you're not into creative photography.  If you're into exploring photos and taking more creative shots and learning more, then this camera is a SKIP.  Do not waste your money or time on it.  Go for something like the Canon Rebel XSi or the Nikon 40D.  Spend a couple of hundred dollars more to get exactly what you want (or save money and just stick with a point and shoot.)I just upgraded to the Canon 40D and skipped over all the step-up cameras and went for the one I knew I'd end up.The class this camera belongs to is confusing...it's not a point and shoot and it's not a true SLR...Last point - HD video.  I took HD video of my 3 year old trick or treating with my niece.  It would have been a nice keepsake, but when I played the video back, it was extremely choppy.  It wasn't even watchable since it cut in and out from start to finish.  That feature was disappointing to say the least.  I planned to send it off to my brother who lives some distance from me, but since it wasn't watchable and we couldnt' even tell what was going on, I never did send it.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!!!!!", "Author": "Love New Orleans", "ReviewID": "R3CDRTU25CHYWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.  It really meets an important need in that niche between big, bulky DSLR cameras and small, handy \"point and shoot\" cameras.  It's reasonably small (it would easily fit in a large coat pocket), light, and very comfortable to operate.  I find the controls easy to locate and operate.It has tons of great program modes.  I have had my camera for a little over a month and haven't had the chance (or need) to play with some of the program modes.  But the ones I have played with have worked exactly as described and have taken outstanding exposures.  I especially love the \"manner/museum\" program that allows for almost silent photography.The manual settings are a really nice touch too for those special occasions that call for a little more control, though you could easily get by without ever using those settings if you didn't feel the need.  With all the program modes available, most situations are easily covered.The zoom is great, and the pause between shots if very short.  The picture quality is excellent.  I don't think I could have made a better choice.My only advice is to download the extended user manual from the Kodak web site to learn all the features available on this great camera.And the experience buying from Amazon.com was flawless.  I have never been a big proponent of on-line shopping, but this whole experience was so smooth and fast that I have put in two additional orders from them in the past month.

I have tried other 8x and 10x zoom cameras the past few years in stores but always had trouble getting sharp point and shoot pictures even with image stabilization. This one works great, it's easy to hook up straight to my computer with the USB cord, and is a reasonable size for all the features.However, it's annoying to have to order a rechargeable battery (and charger since I am not getting the docking station) and hunt down a form fitting case since Kodak does not offer one. The way it's designed, it's needed in order to protect the display monitor (if I just want to toss in a bag - not a big camera case). Especially since the lens cap tends to pop off, as other reviewers have mentioned. I would rather have paid $25 or $30 more, with both included. A couple of years ago, I came back to Kodak after being away for over 15 years. I purchased the pocket sized V570 which has a wide-angle 5X optical zoom range. I found I used it much more then my Fuji FinePix SLR, with extra wide angle lens, because it was too cumbersome. While the Z1012 is smaller then the Fuji, there are still times when I will use the V570 because it's more compact.

Estrada \"John 3:16 For God So loved the Wo...", "ReviewID": "R34RSNMS7ZKSHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am truly amazed at what I got for the money. This camera, the Kodak 1012IS has made me a new loyal Kodak customer from now on. I love this camera so much, that I had to take the time to review it here because I know that reading the reviews is what had a huge part of my decision to purchase along with the affordable price.When compared to the Canon SX or S5, this camera wins Hands Down! First of all, I was originally going to purchase the S5, then the SX came along online, but the price of those products scared my wallet big time. During this tough times people are being extremely careful where their money goes, and to my family that is the norm now.Having said that, I stumbled into this amazing product here on Amazon.com.I was researching prices for the S5, when I saw the Kodak 1012IS.. Right away the firt thing that caught my eye was the ability to record HD yes, HIGH DEFINITION Videos in full 720P resolution! Truly amazing. Not only has our current video VHS-C camera just recently died, our canon digital camera did too, so now we had a tough choice, buy a digital camera or a camcorder. I truly wanted both. Behold the, 1012IS!This camera single handedly has satisfied both my video and picture taking needs. Just last night it arrived at home and right away, out of the box, inserted my recently purchased Transcend 8 GIG Class 6 SDHC card, which I bought here, sold by Beach Camera,oh Boy, was I so pleasantly surprised. The card was recognized immediately, Over 2500 pics availble, how awesome is that. I then proceeded to the Video mode and WOW! I could record HD video to my hearts delight. Truly AMAZING. You know what was so amazing was the ability for the Kodak 1012IS to focus so easily in a very dark room. Specially in video mode, I was so amazed at that ability. And, what was also cool was that if I lost focus for some reason, all I had to do is ZOOM a bit and it refocused again specially after I panned left or right. I was speechless.So remember, You are ABLE to ZOOM while Recording High Definition or standard definition Video. This is simply amazing. It records the Audio in STEREO and it is good enough to understand the kids voices, hear the birds chirp, and all that is going around you in stereo. Its not a recording studio, but it gets the job done nicely.But the VIDEO, it is pure joy to see it, even on the onboard screen as you play it back. Your jaw will definitely drop.Once you transfer the videos and Pics to the PC you will be equally amazed. I recommend that you visit the Kodak Talk Forum at Steves Digital reviews website:[...]I learned so much from there. Also, there is a neat little program that changes your .MOV video files to .AVI so they play smoother on your PC. I forgot the name but it may be: MP4cam2AVI... or something like that. It sure makes a huge difference, and with that, you can use the AVI files to burn the video to DVD.  I use a program called DVD Author 3 and the videos look simply amazing. I know I may sound to over the top, but folks, believe me, I really love this new camera. It focuses so fast, processes so fast, and weights near nothing. It is so confortable in your hands, my wife loved that. Another surprise was how small it was. In pics it looks bigger, but its actually smaller then a regular music CD.Oh, the screen is so clear and it just feels like it should cost more. Kodak, please don't read this. :-)I hope this honest and sincere review helps you decide. I am so happy I now have a Video camera and Picture cameara. All in ONE. And for a price that we can now go to hometown buffett with the family to give thanks to God for great companies like these that have such great prices in times like these where every penny counts.Go ahead, buy it.

I use only the electronic view finder and have the image stabilization always active. I use the automatic and manual modes. I have taken photos using the 12x opitical zoom with 5x digital zoom, 60x equivalent, without a tripod. The images were in focus and produce very good 8x10s. Croping and enlarging not recommended because of loss of resolution at 60x. 12x zoom is excellent. Camera does well at low light but requires more operator ability. The HD movie with stereo sound is nice. I use only fixed focus. Sound level is a little low for my taste but can be corrected using external software. The camera can only except 4gb SDHC memory.

Easy To Use!", "Author": "Kim G. \"Kim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R2W7ONRI73V8QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera! Excuse my lack of professional camera terms but I will try to explain the camera performance in a day-to-day functional way. My main reason for purchasing this camera was the information that stated the camera took good quality photos with quick shutter speed. I am pleased with the shutter speed, especially since I shut off the picture review which seemed to allow for faster consecutive picture taking. My kids are young and active and before I purchased this camera I felt like I was missing some great shots because my previous cameras had slower shutter speeds. The shutter speed is certainly not as fast as a professional camera however it works great for my needs. I mainly use the automatic settings which have produced great photos so far. The camera is pretty light weight and easy to carry with you if you don't mind a camera that won't fit in your pocket. The videos I have taken with the camera have come out well, the sound is audible and clear. I have only two compliants. The first is that the camera will occassionaly \"freeze\" and I have to open the battery cover to get the camera to respond again.

I have to pinch and pull to get the battery out. For all of the things that I love about this camera, my two complaints are pretty minor.

An image almost is brought into focus, then it goes out, and stays there.  My first and last adventure with this camera was a wedding.  I took many available light photos, that were clearly viewable in the viewfinder.  Roughly half of them were out of focus, or the focus was on a part of the image that wasn't in \"the box\".  This camera replaced a 7 year old Olympus Camedia that died.  The Camedia never had this problem with focus.  Reviews discussing shutter lag indicate it is due to focusing taking place after the shutter is pressed.  In that event, with the lag being described as under two-tenths of a second, it would seem that focusing should be very quick, very accurate.  Not in the example camera I had.

Definitely 4 of 5 stars. Its a fantastic still camera, will give you photo lab quality prints. The video feature is great & Kodak fixed the irritating noise problem while shooting video and zooming, this model does not have the problem of hearing a loud zoom during playback.There is one thing though that really annoys me about Kodak and that's their persistent design of only allowing recorded video in .MOV format which is QuickTime.  This makes me seriously consider not getting a Kodak next time because I am a Windows user. I have owned several Kodak digicams & they all export only to .MOV including their newer models like the Ki8.  Now this is a dream come true for Apple fans, but for the rest of the PC world its a bloody nightmare and here's why:  ....MOV files, while fantastic quality, are not easily converted to a Windows format. they need to be converted to use Windows Movie Maker, and also if you want to burn a viewable DVD!  All of the other so-called movie making programs for Windows just don't work as well as Windows Movie Maker.  Windows has various DVD creating programs, some are aftermarket, but almost all don't recognize .MOV so you have to convert the files to .AVI or .WMV (Windows Media for burning DVDs to be watched in any DVD player).Workaround: There are several freeware programs out there that do a good conversion to Windows formats. one that seems to work is Prism Video converter & last I checked there was a free version. But its still time consuming and awkward to convert & keep track of all the diff't formats once you save them to your hardrive. Allegedly there is always a quality degradation when converting but I've found if you do it right & play around with the settings, the Windows files work well, and .wmv is a smaller file size than .avi .  you can then use the .wmv files for movie maker and making DVDs. NOTE: It is NOT NECESSARY to convert the .MOV files if you are not going to edit them, & plan on uploading them raw to YouTube because you can still view the .MOV files in Windows with the use of the free QuickTime player.Only other gripe video audio quality for speech is not that good, 2 of 5 stars here. Its going to be fine in most situations but if you're doing product demos or interviews for YouTube, there's better cameras out there for audio. The bad part about this is Kodak's EARLIER cameras that didn't shoot HD had BETTER audio. That was a shock when I first got this model which was more money. Also the battery life is moderately weak, get a good rechargeable battery on Amazon so you have a backup at all times & you'll be set for any situation.By the way, you don't need to software, its a computer resource hog and your computer (XP or later) will recognize & offload the files just fine on its own.other than these gripes, the camera is a winner and functions great in all other applications, and is extremely easy to use.  The huge glass Schneider lens is a plus, too.Enjoy.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good \"middle ground\" solution for family pictures--video--home budget", "Author": "Craig Arno \"Gadget Connoisseur\"", "ReviewID": "RS7KA6BD6UWNW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3-May-2012: Found MOV to AVI conversion software solution, described below in \"cons\" section.The Z1012 IS camera solves 80+% of my indoor and outdoor family video and picture taking needs.  I also use it for documenting some of my electronic designs.I purchased this camera two years ago to replace my camera bag full of clunky palm sized SVHS Stereo video camera and pocket point-n-shoot with all needed accessories.  What attracted me was the promise of good pictures, use of standard SDHC memory cards (I use 16GB and 32GB SDHC cards) and can use standard AA batteries (not quite true).Pros: - Wide \"Optical\" telephoto range for really close and zooming way in on distant objects. - This camera does a reasonably good job of creating 720p Stereo movies (1280x720 .MOV files), better than my SVHS unit. - Sufficient replacement for a general purpose pocket point-and-shoot with 10.1Megapixel images.  If you are happy with point and shoot, you'll probably like this camera. - I get about a 1 hour of HD720p stereo recording with one 16GB-SDHC card.  A few spares in your pocket with a second DLK800 battery should last for a -lot- of shooting. UPDATE: 32GB SDHC cards also work in this camera. - Length of video shooting is determined by the size of the memory card (use Class 6 speed SDHC) - Fairly wide light level range for indoor/dark pictures without flash. - Flash with red-eye and standard flash settings for still photos. - Runs for a long time on a fully charged Lenmar DLK8000 Digital Camera Equivalent to the Kodak KLIC-8000 Battery with Maximal Power FC600 CAN NB-6L Rapid Travel Charger for Canon Battery (Silver) (two more things to keep track of, but needed for this camera, and inexpensive) - I usually need two fully charged Lenmar DLK8000 Digital Camera Equivalent to the Kodak KLIC-8000 Battery batteries for a day of intensive shooting (400+ pictures and 20-30 minutes of video). - Great price to ensure that one time events with my kids are captured with HD video, stereo sound, and 10Megapixel images, before they are all grown up and picture taking opportunities gone. - This camera is so automated that my 10 year old can take good point and shoot pictures, which is about 80%-90% of our picture/video needs.Cons: - As other reviewers have noted, if you do more than point and shoot and expect easy/quick control over F-stop, shutter timing, and focus foreground/background, you need a real digital SLR, which this product isn't. - 2xAA battery power can be done in an emergency, but the camera will claim batteries are dead in about 5 minutes, which they aren't.  Insufficient internal power supply design.  Use the Lithium Ion battery mentioned above for real world use of this product. - I have enough camera shooting skills that at times I fight the camera automation for color balance, foreground/background focus, shutter speed, things that are fairly straightforward with an SLR. - The .MOV files use an audio format that isn't playable on products like Western Digital WDTV Full HD Media Player - Recertified (Video plays fine, just no sound even though it's there)UPDATE 3-May-2012: MP4Cam2AVI Free Video Conversion software (to convert this camera's MOV files to AVI)[...]MP4Cam2AVI software converts (has batch mode) the Z1012 IS .mov files to .avi.  The problem solved is many media players can't handle the PWM audio track encoded by the camera.  This Open Software project by default doesn't convert the video (lossless process), just the problematic stereo audio track.  The result is an AVI file which plays perfectly on my WD-Live player to my TV.In general, even with the limitations listed above, I'm generally happy with this purchase at the relatively low price listed.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like taking pictures", "Author": "Charles E.

I usually keep it in automatic mode because it seems to work the best when in this mode.

It shows you an indicator on the LCD screen while you are framing up the photo if the flach is going to come on or not.  A icon of a candle means no way!  Now you can fool the camera buy tilting it or moving around until the candle icon goes away, then click.  This usually only happens in dimly lit situations that would be like being in candle light.  You can however take it out of auto and change it to aperture control.  The flash works and the quality of the picture is very close to auto mode.  It's just a pain to snap 6 indoor shots and the number 7 has no flash because auto determined not to turn on the flash.I used the video portion and it plays back great on the camera, but I did not have the same success once I downloaded it to my computer.

Well, suddenly nothing happened anymore. I consulted the \"extended manual\" for trouble shooting tips, to no avail.

Except: There never was such a green blinking light. OK, so that didn't make sense. Then I used the online chat. The technician finally instructed me to buy a \"U-8 USB cable\", which I did. He really didn't make much sense to me (first he told me that my USB port on my computer was broken. when I objected that other devices work just fine, and that I tried all three ports, then he said \"you need a U-8 cable\". well, what do you mean? that I don't have one, or that the one I have is broken. \"you need a U-8 USB cable).

At that price, it can't hurt! And it has been performing like a champ. The video is great, I'm getting lots of great photos -- all without knowing too much about cameras. I'm a point-and-shoot photographer and this camera has definitely improved my game while not requiring me to make a true study of photography.My only 'negative' comments are things that don't bother me, but might bother others: there is a noise associated with the zoom, even when using the \"museum\" setting, so factor that in if you're trying to be discreet. The auto focus on the video works great, but in low light, it is constantly refocusing so your videos may have a slight blur here and there. Again, for my purposes, I don't care about that stuff. A GOOD thing about the video is that the mic works really well and the sound is nicely balanced (videos of a live band in a small bar turned out great, where my previous camera would have sounded a little muffled) and you can use the zoom while recording [I think it says in the manual that you can't, but mine does].I'm really happy with it. The external battery charger is almost required. When I recharge using the USB cable, it never seems to charge fully or last very long. But that is also expected (based on my past cameras).

Since a real DSLR is out of my budget at the moment I got this one as a transition step. Most of my experience has been from point a shot cameras so this is my first encounter with PASM modes. To be fair, the camera performs as expected. I do not like smart modes since they get the \"Perfect Touch\" automaticaly applied and also tends to select higher ISO values wich results in a bit noisy pictures. In the positive side, smart capture mode has a function to track your subject once it gets focused that is realy nice and handy. Scene modes are more than enough for casual, family and landscape photos. If you are looking for an affordable way to get yourself into the aperture/shutter speed concerns  then this camera is a sure bet for learning it without losing the point and shot simplicity. What I really miss in this camera is the ability to save photos in raw format (Z1015 IS does it already, although I don't know how good it's at it), KODAK should consider to offer that functionality to Z1012 owners (even it they charge them for that I'd take it).  Picture quality is very good, especialy in well lit conditions. I don't give it a five stars because of the annoying wasted time with the \"proccesing\" message that freeze the camera from time to time.

Definitely not professional grade, but absolutely a great step up for beginners wanting to graduate from a point and shoot. I bought this camera about a year ago and I take it with me just about everywhere I go (I have a 6 year old and am always snapping away). It's fairly small, lightweight and fits easily in my pocketbook. Needless to say, this camera is one sturdy piece of equipment. It's been dropped several times and down right beat up from as much as I use it, but it's never broken and still works as well as the day I bought it.In 'smart mode' this camera takes wonderful pictues. I have received several compliments on the quality of photographs taken. On the other hand, all the manual modes are pretty worthless.. but then again, if you're experienced enough to be using the manual modes and using them on a regular basis, it almost seems worthless to have this type of camera.The only complaint I really have about this camera is it's overall speed and response time... Powering on and using the zoom lag more than I would like. Also when you use the 'burst' feature to take multiple images it takes the camera a reeeeallly long time to process the images once you're done shooting. Also be prepared to spend some bucks on batteries, as they are drained very quickly.I would absolutely reccomend this camera to anyone who is currently using a simple point and shoot, and wants to upgrade (on a budget) prior to making the leap to an SLR.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exelentes C\u00e1mara", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R344TTH9YYL22U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Soy un aficionado dando mis primeros pasos en la fotograf\u00eda y esta c\u00e1mara es genial.

However, if there is even the slightest light (i.e. a candle or distant streetlight), the flash doesn't work, producing a bad picture. Does anyone know a way around the automatic flash? Is there a way that I can make the flash stay on no matter what?Other than that, this camera is wonderful. I bought it at Walmart after debating on another cheap camera or spending good money on a nice one. I'm glad I made the decision I did! The lithium batteries that are required are a tad bit expensive, but have a good battery life, so that's okay. The video function works well - it doesn't replace a camcorder by any means, but it does what I need it to do. The HD videos look great, even after YouTube's compression!Also, as previously stated, an 8GB card does cause a bit of lag in the processing, and it seems to lag the camera by about 10 seconds when turning it on, but I can live with that.

And somehow my kid managed to pull the cushioned viewfinder piece right off and I can't get it back on for the life of me.

Myers \"Veronica\"", "ReviewID": "R21LJ97VMIK2JX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera at WalMart. I wanted the 12x optical zoom, ease of the camera and to maybe later do videos. The instruction booklet is far too big because it comes in many languages, but for my use what instructions I need is there and simple. So, only 25 pages are useful.  I am unhappy at this time with the Kodak lithium CRV3 non - rechargeable battery that came with the camera. The camera died after about 200 shots (not including some deleted ones) and I zoomed in to crop several pictures. I also played and tested as many of the features as I could or want to. The zoomed in picture quality on the \"sport\" feature was very grainy and so the pictures became garbage - useless. Quite a few pictures taken outside on a clear day came out really bleached out (the subjects faces) and the colors (their clothing) were really bad. I could not fix them any where they were so bad. I'm not sure if this was due to the cameras battery getting ready to die or not. Also, once you crop a picture one time you cannot crop it again, the option is not available. You cannot print the pictures stored on the camera (not on your memory card) unless you first load the included Kodak EasyShare cd. Don't forget, you can't keep a lot of pictures on the camera memory either, so you will need to invest in a high speed memory card, which isn't too expensive. I bought a 2GB Kodak brand for $13.88. I also don't like the plastic top/cover on the plug on the camera, the slot where you insert the cable to connect to USB, as it's flimsy. There are no instructions in the manual on how to get the pictures off the cameras memory either. I've heard detailed instructions have to be downloaded or purchased.  I'm glad the camera comes with a strap since you can't find a case for the camera.  I'm not sure if I will keep this camera or not. I will give it one more chance with the new Duracell CR-V3 battery I just bought, otherwise I will not invest in a charger and re chargable battery, I will just return the whole camera.  I'm not crazy about the lens popping off the camera like others mentioned and I thought I wouldn't mind the bulk but a smaller camera may suit my needs better and I don't want to worry about the lens if the plastic lens cap keeps popping off. Now, maybe the lens cap should have a strap and attach it to the camera? You have to understand, I take a lot of pictures, crop them all of the time and use the pics for gifts and scrapbooking, So I usually keep a camera with me fully charged and in my purse. I have a Sony Cybershot DSC P100 that takes much better pictures, zooms in as close as I thought I needed, is light weight, easy to use, super easy to re charge a battery, dependable and very sturdy. By the way, I purchased a Sony Cyber Shot Lithium battery with the camera when I bought it quite a few years ago and have NEVER replaced it. Also, the lens is a Carl Zeiss lens and is super clear and still not scratched.  I've dropped it a few times and it's still great.  It just doesn't have the high zoom, i'd like and has only 5.1 mega pixels. We'll see if I keep the new Kodak camera, I'm still testing it and researching other cameras. You won't find many cameras with the 10.1 mp and 12x zoom capability in this price range (I paid $240.00) but I am unhappy with the zoom capability, the \"sports\" mode which I thought would be a nice feature to have, some of the other modes P, S & A, the lens cap situation and having to buy extra batteries and a re charger.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Was a loyal Kodak Customer-- Never Again!!", "Author": "C.

What you get for the price is a camera, lens cap, USB cable, a docking station `adapter', and a limited one-time use battery! When that's expired, you'll need to buy another, or invest in a rechargeable battery, and a charger.It `does not' come with a rechargeable battery, nor a docking station to recharge a battery... that's `extra'. The docking station adapter that does come with the camera is for Kodak's Series 3 docking station, `sold separately', and in the $50.00 price range.If you're like me, and want a docking station that recharges a battery, (and transfer images to a computer), a travel charger, and an extra spare battery, plan in throwing another $100.00 into this camera! And that's buying third party `compatible' batteries. If you want original Kodak batteries, plan on that figure going up even higher!Also, what appears in the pictures to be a camera similar in size and shape to a standard 35mm camera, don't be fooled by that! This camera is `tiny', probably about 1/3 the size of a standard camera. While many may like smaller digital cameras, the picture is still very deceiving.This camera was released in January 2008, and there still aren't very many accessories available for it. One possible desirable option is a 1.4 X tele-converter, manufactured by someone else, but shown through Kodak's web site, and only usable `after' you purchase an adapter from Kodak. But you best be sitting down when you look at the price! Don't know how a tele-converter would affect a digital camera, I know on film type cameras, they do cut way back on picture quality and resolution.And Kodak's customer service `really' sucks! I called to find out the maximum capacity of a Secure Digital Card that can be used with this camera, as well as the maximum transfer rate that this camera can handle.Yes friends, the camera doesn't come with any extra memory either! There's only 32 MB of internal memory available as it comes. So figure on spending anywhere from twenty to `eighty-five dollars', (on Kodak's web site), for a high capacity memory card, depending on the capacity of the card you want to use, and the transfer rate.After about 4 hours on the telephone, with people that couldn't speak good English, or even understand English, I `think' I figured out what `might' work in this camera. Luckily I purchased memory cards from a dealer that will accept them back if they don't work in this camera.Kodak's customer service conflicts with what little information they have on their own web site when it comes to such information. The `accessory' page on Kodak's site for this particular camera, only shows a 1 gig & 2 gig memory card available for this camera. However if you view `all' accessories, go to their memory cards, look at the 4 gig card, it will show it being compatible with this camera.Customer service told me the 1 gig & 2 gig memory cards is what is recommended for this camera, and they can't guarantee that the 4 gig card would work, even though their web site says the 4 gig is compatible with this camera.No mention of an 8 gig or 16 gig SD card that are now available on the market, and going down in price. One would think that Kodak would have thought ahead a little, and manufactured their new `10 mega-pixel' camera with the capacity of accepting the newest high capacity, high transfer rate memory cards.It was a whole other story trying to find out the maximum transfer rate this camera could handle as well. Something important when shopping around for other manufacture's memory cards on the Internet, with each manufacture having different terminology with respect to transfer rates, and naturally to find the most, for the least.I got my camera when Kodak was having a one-day, `two-hour' special promotion, for $199.99, and even at that price I was extremely disappointed at all the `extras' I had to purchase afterwards. The docking station, home & travel charger set, two `generic' rechargeable batteries, two memory cards, and I just threw another $150.00 into this camera.If I would have known about all the extra money I had to add into this to make it a decent 'complete' camera, and all the time it cost me in finding out information that should have been on Kodak's web site, I would have never even considered this camera!Can't comment on the 10 mega-pixel quality, ease of use, or any other features of the camera as I haven't even used it yet...
