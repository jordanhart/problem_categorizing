{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Okay, everyone... LISTEN UP...", "Author": "Gregg L. DesElms", "ReviewID": "R20YNZDMVWQQM5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The FE-220 is a perfectly fine little camera......but as of this writing (25 Feb 2012), it is REALLY OLD technology!  Cameras much cooler than this one -- even ones made by Olympus -- and which sport better/newer technology, including higher resolution, and using more modern memory cards, are all OVER the place, here at Amazon... and usually for a TON less money!I bought one of these FE-220s from a Wal-Mart only something like six months after it was first released, and even back THEN it could be had for from $99 to $149.  I've since seen them on clearance for fifty bucks... sometimes even less.And don't get me wrong, I still have and use the camera.  We originally bought it for my wife, but then we got a much newer, FAR better Olympus model for her; and so I started using this one.  I normally use an SLR, but this FE-229 is nice to just grab and run and use for simple snapshots and stuff, when an SLR is overkill.  The truth is, though, that the camera in my Samsung smartphone is better than this FE-220 -- heck, some of its pictures are almost as good as my SLR -- so I confess that I've not been using the FE-220 as much lately.  But that doesn't mean that this isn't a fine little camera.  But it's just really old technology, now; and that factors-in to its value.I'm irritated by such pricing as we see here because of what I just wrote; and because there's at least one guy I know (and for all I know, he could be one of the sellers here) who at one point was selling this thing for $699... which was way more than even the original MSRP!  When I wrote him an email and called him on his obvious price gouging, what he emailed back were the words of a mean-spirited, oppotunistic, disingenuous jerk.  Not all sellers around here can be trusted.The pricing I see here is reminiscent of that old price-gouging jerk.  BE CAREFUL!!!!Yes this little, old camera is nice, but DO NOT buy such an old camera for so much money!  Look around:  You can get a brand new, current technology camera from no shortage of sellers around here -- sellers with great ratings/reputations and customer service; and which don't price gouge -- for a mere FRACTION of what they want for this now-almost-ancient (by technology standards) FE-220.  BEWARE!This camera, by today's standards, is, quite literally, worth maybe $30(US)... I kid you not.  I suppose one would not be shooting oneself in the foot to pay $50, but, seriously, not a single penny more!  In fact, at $50, shipping should be free.Man... the NERVE of some of these price-gouging sellers!  Unbelievable.Hope that helps.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera Review FE-220", "Author": "Patrick A. Turner", "ReviewID": "RFKASFUWOHAU3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love these type of Olympus cameras: they hold lots of pics, have clear quality, easy to charge and good guide wheel on the camera to help you judge how to use the camera best. I've had it for over a year and have taken this camera to several countries around the world and have never been disappointed. By now, it is probably not even sold by Olympus I would gather but I plan to have it for several more years. Technically, the only complaint I have is taking a picture at night, within a room, at a distance beyond 20 ft with a flash. It is slim, nice to look at and can stored easily. I have two other Olympus cameras, FE-190s- that are the earlier generation of this camera and they were very durable and easy to use. One of the FE-190s is about 5 years old and have taken literally thousands of pictures and even took it to Iraq during a year long Deployment and it performed admirably and still being used today by a family member. It was priced very reasonable and I don't think anyone could go wrong with this camera for vacations, everyday use and so forth.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I broke the old one...", "Author": "Angie", "ReviewID": "R3HHKZJS5YKG7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just as described, just like the old one my husband had that I broke.
