I love the ones (like this) that keep the electrons flowing between the camera and the lens.  Yes, you pay more for these, but you retain control of autofocus (though I don't generally use that in macro shots) and aperture (which I absolutely do use).  I also have tubes without the electronic pathways.  They sit on a shelf and gather dust.  This set of tubes travels with me in my camera bag and gets used when appropriate.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Work as intended", "Author": "Dreammoose \"dreammoose\"", "ReviewID": "R1KF73IYL1KUNJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They are nicely finished, mount and dismount smoothly and fit properly. The electrical contacts work fine, so AF, aperture, etc. work normally.With the big Olympus 75-300 lens mounted, they flex just a little, so I can see a sliver of light between tube and camera mount at the top. As I mostly use this lens supported by my left hand, and the flex is minimal, it's not really a performance issue. With smaller, lighter lenses, it's not a problem.As with any extension tubes, the optical results depend on the lens, and how it performs out of the design distance from the sensor. Generally, with modest extension, results will be good. I've tried both, but only use the 10 mm in practice.I bought these before reasonably priced ones with metal mounts were available. I'd probably go with metal if buying now, but reviews aren't in on them as yet, so who knows.I can say these work fine, and I'll be keeping and using them - well mostly the 10 mm.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BY0F0P0"}}
