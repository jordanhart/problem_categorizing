{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Piece of plastic junk!", "Author": "Tazzman \"tazzman225\"", "ReviewID": "R3ET4XJ08CQT4S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I earned one of these cameras after obtaining points in a survey site.  It is made from cheap chrome color plastic and they do not supply the batteries.  I had to use my own AAA batteries which kept popping out because of the bad springs in the camera.  I would not be afraid to bet that is just another Chinese slave labor item.Plus if the batteries die or you remove them, you lose images.  It does not take memory cards!  I went to check out their website, which is very lame, and I could not find anyone to write to you about it.  I am returning this camera!  Stay away!", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "One Star Rating Is Too High!", "Author": "Christee \"Christee\"", "ReviewID": "R2DKU1URLLZ8NZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon is asking for $25 for a piece of plastic that takes terrible pictures and cheaply constructed.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked for the price. Inexpensive, it seems, does not have to mean \"CHEAP\".
