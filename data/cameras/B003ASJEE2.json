Camera", "Author": "Recycledbooks77 \"Sunshine\"", "ReviewID": "R2CS79SQA9573B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is a great camera for the price it is very easy to figure out.  The camera hold's a lot of pictures.  When you take the pictures outside you get somewhat of a clear picture.  I think the camera does not have enough pixels, most of the pictures are o.k.  There is no charger, the batteries go dead very fast, which is expensive. After I had used the camera for about a year the plug on the camera (where you download) the solder wore off.  I can fix that though.  This is a great starter camera", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$19.99", "Features": "5.0 megapixels\n4x digital zoom\nAccepts SD/SDHC memory cards (32MB internal memory included)", "Name": "Philips See Me See YouTM Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31gYQy%2BjBzL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ASJEE2"}}
