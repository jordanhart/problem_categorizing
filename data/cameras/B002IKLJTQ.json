{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Very Good Camera", "Author": "Photo-Am \"Vlad\"", "ReviewID": "R1YH92BM9M0YNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased my Panasonic DMC-ZR1 still camera via Amazon just a few days ago because I needed an ultra-compact backup for may Nikon D90. When you travel there might be some situations when you are not in the mood or just can not use your DSLR. So I was looking for a small camera, which could produce high quality outdoor pictures and HD video.I'm an advanced amateur photographer. I take pictures mostly on weekends and vacations when I prefer to have in my pocket a small but sophisticated camera which I can forget about during the day but which can take great shots when it is needed. That is why my best cameras were Sony DSC-T1, T30, and recently - T100. The latter one was nominated as the best ultra-compact in 2007, and it indeed was. But time flies and a new 16:9 wide format came to still cameras and video, which T100 did not support. So about a year ago I purchased Panasonic DMC-TZ5 and a little bit later - FZ18. I bought FZ18 because of its incredibly bright 18x super zoom lens. I believe that each of above mentioned cameras was an absolute champion in their class at that time, but now I wanted something almost as good as that but in a small package.After doing a lot of research on Amazon.com and dpreview I've chosen ZR1. My first impression - it's a very good camera. I like a solid build quality of its metall body. There are no flimsy elements or grinding sounds while zooming or focussing. Zoom itself is very smooth both optically and mechanically. While taking stills it is very fast, however it has some inertia. While shooting video it's relatively slow, which allowes autofocus to do its job well.What I like very much about my Sony T100 - when shooting video of a moving subject the autofocus keeps it in focus all the time by doing a very small adjustments which you can hardly admit. Many other P&S; cameras either do not allow zooming on video or hunting focus most of the time. That was the issue with the original TZ5, which was significantly improved in software update ver. 1.2. From my prospective the new ZR1 has as the same great autofocus mechanism as my T100 - when you follow a moving subject or apply zoom ZR1 keeps it in focus nicely (and without producing any noticeable sound). But when you do a panorama without a central moving object - do it slowly to allow the camera to decide, which next part of your picture should be in focus. On still pictures the autofocus is very quick and precise.The 8x zoom Leica lens is just great: very good colors fidelity, contrast, and color saturation in the entire zoom range from wide to tele. The wide 25mm (equivalent) is great, but it comes at some cost: for the distant subjects the barrel distortions and the decrease of sharpness of the peripheral areas are pretty visible, however when you shoot from a relatively close distance around 1.5-3 m it seems some special processing is involved because there is almost no any visible barrel distortions or loss of sharpness. I have to admit all three my Panasonic cameras behave the same way but for ZR1 it's more noticable because of its incredibly wide 25mm lens. If you apply a little bit zoom the resolution becomes pretty even accross the picture and with no barrel distortions. I did not perform any special stress testing but on all the pictures I've got I did not see any chromatic aberrations or vignetting in the entire zoom range. Physically you can zoom in the only 8x range but it is possible to increase it up to 15.6x for the lower 3MP picture resolution. Normally you might want that if you're taking pictures of some specific subjects like kids, birds, or animals. Just imagine - having 400mm equivalent telephoto lens in your pocket - it's just amazing, and IMHO those 3MP shots look pretty good on my 24\" monitor (if you do not crop them more).A new ZR1 has the impressive 12MP comparing to 9MP of TZ5 but on the same sensor size, and as a result - more noise. On the dpreview site you could read that Panasonic did a great job by separating the entire noise into its low-frequency and high-frequency wavebands and also splitting the color and luminance noise and handling them separately. My comparative edge-to-edge testing of both ZR1 and TZ5 shots showed that ZR1 does exactly what was stated and does it pretty good. On the ZR1 picturese taken at dim light conditions the noise was remarkable less than on the TZ5's ones! However at a very-very dark conditions when the pictures become very grainy you can see that the level of noise from ZR1 is somewhat bigger, than from TZ5. Another good news is that the white balance in ZR1 is almost perfect: the night pictures taken by TZ5 and FZ18 were either colored red or had some other weird colors while ZR1 in alomst dark situations showed as the same correct white balance as if the pictures were taken at a day-light time.If you're shooting on a bright sunny day your pictures might be too much contrasty and either shadow parts like trees can be darken to black or the blue sky or some other light areas might be completely washed out. The camera menu does not allow you to adjust the contrast directly but you can set an Intelligent Exposure mode instead. Then it constantly analyzes the scene and if it has too much contrast the camera automatically applys either slower shutter speed or higher ISO and reduces the overal contrast. I found that on ZR1 that feature is not that good as on TZ5. Another way is to switch the mode dial to \"MS\" or \"SCN\" mode and select \"High Dynamic\" scene. In that case camera unconditionally and remarkably decreases the overall contrast (more than in Intelligent mode) and adjusts the shutter speed or/and ISO the way that even dark areas are well exposed, and that really works well.There are the two things which are still better on my T100 than on ZR1 or TZ5: the quality of the VGA video and the clarity of sound. However having the HD video mode you might not need VGA at all. The quality of HD video on ZR1 is as the same great as on TZ5 and the image stabilization is even slightly better. But for stills the image stabilization was much more improved, I guess more than the 2 times as they stated. On the maximum zoom in low light many of my TZ5 pictures were slightly smeared, while the ones taken by ZR1 at the same time were perfect.I like the ZR1's menu and controls - they're similar to TZ5' and are very clear and intuitive. Plus there are some additional functions. It allows you to set some parameters manually, but do it only if you're very clear about what you're doing, otherwise let that sophisticated camera do it for you. For example: you might be taking a picture of a tree and the system sets the ISO=100 and shutter speed 1/20. But then you see a small squirell and apply the 15.6x zoom to have it big enough on your screen. As a result system might change ISO to 500 and shutter to 1/100. You might be thinking that the camera got crazy, but actually it detected that your hands are shaking too much for the big focal length you set and so the shutter speed needs to be much faster to prevent the shot to be blurred. It's intelligent mode is pretty good.UPDATE: This ZR1 camera has an incredible display: it shows pictures at any angle and even in the direct sunlight. A while ago I was going on vacation to Cancun and I purchased a Kodak V1273 ultracompact camera because of its wide-screen stills and HD video. But when I tried to use it on the beach I was totally confused - nothing, absolutely nothing was visible on display on a sunny day! If I did not have my Sony T100 as a backup all my vacation would be completely spoiled. In the direct sunlight the image on the T100's display looks like a black-and-white reflection, but at least you can point and frame your shots and use the menu. ZR1 does even better - the picture in the direct sunlight has all the colors, just looks darker and not that contrast. On the TZ5's display if you slightly turn camera around the horizontal axis the brightness and contrast of the image is changing pretty much. On the ZR's one picture remains the same regardless of from what angle you are looking at it. It means you're not going to regret the display is not swivable as well as you will not miss the optical viewfinder because you can see the pictures even in the direct sunlight. Only one thing: it seems the palette of that display is a kind of limited and it might not show some subtle tints of colors, so don't judge colors until you see it on a good monitor.UPDATE2: Recently I did some comparative testing of the picture quality of my ZR1 and TZ5. A side-by-side comparison has shown that the general resolution and sharpnes of the ZR1's pictures is remarkably higher than of TZ5's ones. From the detailed analysis I got an impression that around 20% of that improvement comes from higher sensor resolution (12MP verse 9MP), 30-40% because of the better noise reduction, and about 40-50% because of the stronger internal sharpening in ZR1 than that in TZ5. When I did some sharpening to my TZ5's photos using the Nero Photoshop the difference became less visible. For better understanding why the more sophisticated noise reduction might help pictures to look sharper you can think about it this way: as the same as contrast is a difference between light and dark areas, sharpness is a difference between plain areas and edges. The less a certain area has noise, the more it looks \"plain\", and so it more differentiates from edges making a sharper impression. Also because the original purpose of this purchase was to have a backup for my Nikon D90 I did some comparison of their HD video capabilities. Would you believe or not - ZR1 provided much better moving picture resolution than D90. Of course the ZR1's movies show some noise (as the same as any other compact P&S; camera) while D90's ones don't. That noise is not much noticable because it looks like the one on the film cameras and I could not admit any visible artefacts, so the general impression is much better, and when I have a choice between D90 and ZR1 I will definitely shoot HD movies with my ZR1 camera.So I think this is a very good camera and the best in its class for now.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "cmelch4994", "ReviewID": "R1Y97SP7KSPULT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent lots of time researching cameras and reading hundreds of reviews.  I got so frustrated because it seemed that no camera in my price range (under $250) met my needs.  Well, I finally just crossed my fingers and ordered the Panasonic.  What a great decision.  I love this camera!  It is very easy to use, and I am notorious for hating to read users manuals.  You can figure this camera out within 5 - 10 minutes and a little help from the manual.  The pictures are great, but you do have to use the right settings.  I really love the video part because now I can get rid of my stupid Sony handicam and its ridiculous little tapes that I cannot do anything with.  I now have one device for pictures and video which all fits easily into my purse.I was worried about getting a Panasonic because it is not a company known for its cameras, but this is such a great little device.  If you are like me, a mom who wants to make sure that you have a good camera so you don't miss those magic moments in your child's life, but are pretty much a novice when it comes to photography, this camera is for you.  It will make you look and feel like a pro!", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid camera, good buy", "Author": "Liam H Dooley", "ReviewID": "RY8OVYDDTD3LY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time shopping around for a camera, and determined that you cannot have everything - trade-offs have to made. I had previously been a fan of sony cameras, but the recent CMOS model cameras had received terrible image quality reviews, so after further research I found taht the newer Panasonics were positively reviewed.PRO:-Excellent image quality. sometimes I have trouble focusing accurately - and I don't find this out until it's too late (ie when I see it on the computer). But generally, the colors are brilliant and well balanced.-Good 8x zoom. I don't need 12x zoom that another, similar Panasonic offers. 8x is enough, without overly increasing the size.-Great Price! It's less expensive than other cameras, but not lower quality.-Good image stabilizer. Sony's traditional have excellent image stabilizers, and are still the lead in this area. But the Panasonic seems sufficient.CONS:-A bit slow to start up and shut down-Non-dedicated \"play\" button. This means I have to always toggle between viewing photos and taking photos. Very annoying; I will often forget that I was \"viewing\" photos, and then have to switch to photo taking mode after turning on the camera.-Size - it isn't that small. Not too big, but it's larger than the smaller Sony's and Canons.-Off-center screw-hole for tripod. Annoying, as the camera is hard to balance with the smaller tripods.-No shutter opening time adjustment. Few compacts have this; my casio does. It's nice to be able to set the shutter opening time for 1 second - 20 seconds, to take interesting night-time photos.Altogether, the DMC-ZR1 is a nice camera. Well balanced, I like the blue body, and a good buy.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "J.

Easy to use and great pictures so far.Only complaint is the location of the \"quick zoom button\".  For those who hold the camera with a \"one handed grip\", it means placing your thumb in the same location of this button.  Simple adjustment of moving your thumb to the left to miss it but can be a little annoying at times if you accidentally hit the quick zoom button.Buying an extra battery can also be a real challenge since for some reason they quit making the OEM battery that comes with it. I have found battery's sold for it are the wrong size even thought they state they fit. I have already returned one battery which was the wrong size and am now waiting for another one I just ordered from another source.

To be fair,  you can not expect a sub $300 point and shoot to be on par with digital SLRs costing hundreds more.  With that being said,  it is amazing how much technology is packed in to this little camera.  12 megapixels, leica Lens, 8X zoom, image stabilization, HD video, face detection......The ZR1 is capable of taking spectacular images,  but it is not perfect.  It strugles indoors and in low light.Even outdoors in perfect conditions I have taken some blurry shots, but over all I think it is hard beat for the price.The range of the Lens is incredibile.  The 35mm equivilent of a 25mm wide angle to 200mm telephoto should be enough to handle just about any photo situation you might encounter.  I wish the lens could be open wider than 3.3.  I also would have liked an optical view finder,  but this feature is becoming harder and harder to find these days.  Aperture and Shutter priority modes would have been nice to have too,  but there are plenty scene modes that could be useful.  I have tried the high dynamic mode and it seems to be very effective.Another plus is how quickly it starts up and can focus.And it looks cool in Blue.Bottom Line - This is a great little take anywhere camera, loaded with cool features for the money.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for compact travel.", "Author": "Rose Marie Prins", "ReviewID": "R3QLWM6GSLH8EP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great for a non-professional photographer who doesn't know much, but can learn quickly the different options of which there seem to be a nice amount.

Looked around at price vs performance and decided on this one.I'm happy with it. The picture quality is fantastic. I don't like to twiddle much with my camera - I want to capture the moment and moments don't wait. I use it in \"full auto\" mode most of the time and it figures the rest out really well. It likes to use the flash, but it is easy to turn on and off and when it is off the camera is really good about adjusting and still getting a good picture.  It has a bunch of automatic modes that take a bit more time to select (there are a bunch of them) and they work really well, too. I use the sunset one and the action one the most.It has a fast \"recovery\" time and when taking action pictures can be set to snap three in a row, which is nice. The zoom is really good - easy to get close. It also does HD movies, which I don't use a whole lot having learned that movies tend to never be seen after making them.Not a cheap camera, but a good one.

Its ability to take HD movies (720p) and widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio) photos were also compelling purchase points.I bought this camera knowing full well that there is some controversy regarding its latest firmware upgrade (1.2), which prevents the use of third party batteries. However, the camera came with firmware version 1.0, so I think I'm not affected. (I'm also not aware of any compelling reason to upgrade the firmware, thus far.) My only gripe is the lack of an external power jack. The battery can only be recharged outside of the camera in the supplied battery charger. Given how cheap the camera was for the features it provides, I can overlook that. I bought an 8GB memory card along with the camera to be able to make good use of its movie-taking capability.

Anyway this Lumix is a sweet camera because it's pretty compact, although some of the buttons/menus are kind of confusing (like when it's in Intelligent Auto mode you cannot put on a fill flash but you can use the fill flash in a different mode; and the on/off and take/view picture buttons aren't obvious to other people who I've handed my camera to to take pictures; and it's not totally clear when you are recording a video).  The battery charge is external (you take the battery out of the camera and put it in the wall charger) which is kind of inconvenient, but I guess I'm just used to a camera that you plug into a cord that plugs into the wall outlet.

I haven't gotten to experiment too much yet as I can't get anywhere with the software.Thanks to anyone who can help.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1-megapixel resolution\n25mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens; 8x zoom, Power O.I.S.\nCapture HD video at 1280x720, 30fps\n2.7-inch  TFT LCD screen\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR1 12.1MP Digital Camera with 8x POWER Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N9XxPPXHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002IKLJTQ"}}
