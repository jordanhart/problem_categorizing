This camera reminds me of my Olympus SP-820UZ digital camera, but with a considerably larger optical zoom lens. Camera seems rather easy to use and photo quality seems acceptable. It's no DSLR camera and photo quality is typical super zoom point & shoot quality, which is fine with me. The only issue I have is that it's rather hard to locate a replacement battery for this camera as this is a fairly new Kodak camera model and not even sure if this is a true Kodak camera. I have read other reviews elsewhere and the indications is that it is made in China by JK. I have had no prior cameras from this company and was questionable about this camera at first. My prior Kodak digital cameras had shutter lag that was bad, except for the Z-612 which had no shutter lag....but this one seems better and again this Kodak digital camera seems on-par with my current Olympus SP-820 UZ digital camera for picture quality and speed....which is pretty decent overall for the month I have had this Kodak camera.I recommend this digital camera if general photography is what you need it for. I have not tried the video on this camera yet, so I cannot comment on it. Anyways, photos seems to come out good with this camera and optical zoom is good.This camera gets a 3 of 5 star rating from me.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CLERWOU"}}
