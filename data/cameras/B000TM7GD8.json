This is my third digital camera - supplementing a Pentax Optio S4i.  I researched this class of camera (more versatility and better quality than a sub-compact, but not as expensive as a DSLR) for a couple of months.  If you look, there are a ton of sites doing very helpful, detailed camera reviews, although as a brand new model, there is not yet much on the FZ18.I wanted something that was point and shoot for my wife (she takes great photos, but does not want the hassle of making adjustments) but versatile for me. I used to have a film SLR, and understand the basics of controlling shutter speed, aperture, etc.  I loved the idea of 18x optical zoom, the 28mm wide angle, and all the shake reduction/face finding, etc.  I seriously considered the Sony DSC H5, H7, and H9; the Canon S5 IS; the Olympus SP-550UZ/560UZ and the Panasonic FZ8.  The Sony looks and feels great, but the spec is not as good as the newer FZ18, and many reviews refer to the no-intuitive user interface and long learning curve.  The Olympus and Canon offerings in this class just did not match the FZ18 specs, and the earlier model FZ8 was getting great reviews, so I went with the latest FZ18.Bottom line - both my wife and I are very pleased with the FZ18.  The first set of vacation photos are superb.  My daughter was with us and borrowed the Pentax, so we have some pretty good side-by-side comparisons, and the FZ18 wins hands down on everything, except fitting in a pocket!  Even then, it's pretty light, and with a 4Gig ultra fast card, has loads of capacity.  I can highly recommend this camera as the current state of the art in this class.  Easy to use for those who want a point-and-shoot, flexible for those who want more control, great specs, and superb quality photos.  I even found the manual fairly easy to use - a rare treat with some sophisticated electronics!You will read critics complaints about noise (speckles) when you push the limits of the sensor - unless you are always shooting in very low light conditions, and blowing the results up into huge posters, you won't be troubled by noise.  If you are, the problem is common to all compacts (from my research), so if it concerns you, spend another few hundred bucks and get a DSLR!One warning - this camera is available at a deep discount on a couple of sites - when I tried to purchase one from one of these, it became apparent it was a \"gray market\" camera from Japan.  Not a great idea for a US user!  I ended up getting mine through an Amazon partner - no problems at all, and a decent price.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "The FZ18 is a gem", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "R29FDB84448FM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic puts a great deal of effort into their Lumix line. And they keep producing winners. The FZ18 is, in one word, a gem.  There is little radical in the way of new design. The well-established basic Lumix FZ design remains intact. Not quite a pocket camera like the worthy Lumix TZ3 and smaller than the somewhat more sophisticated and substantially larger FZ50. Panasonic's Venus III engine is dependable, relatively fast and capable.  It is the new features of the FZ18 that make it a standout. The 18x zoom is marvelous:  28mm to 504mm in the palm of your hand. Mind-blowing is the only word for it. And the Leica designed optics are as sharp as any on the market and, in fact, sharper than most. Coupled with an 8 Megapixel sensor, you're set for just about any common photographic need. The FZ18 is not intended to substitute for a Nikon or Canon dSLR. It is an everyday camera. But it is fine for photographing tourist vistas, family events, the everyday things that are the subjects of most photos.  Color rendition is accurate, though not perfect. The inclusion of an ISO 1600 equivalent is nice producing noisy, but usable, shots.  Focusing is generally fast, with some hunting in low light on the long end of the zoom.  The image stabilization is, as usual with the Lumix line, superb.  The flash is adequate out to about 15 feet or so with rapid fall-off on the edges. There is no shoe for an external flash. Do not use the supplied lens hood with the flash: it casts a shadow.  One of the new features is a three-shot option on the self-timer, which is surprisingly handy. It takes three pictures so if Aunt Tilly thinks she had her eyes closed, you don't have to walk back to the camera to reset the self-timer.  Works with the flash nicely.  There's a face detection feature and an auto-focus zone selector. I haven't quite decided on the value of either of these features yet.  You can save to RAW or RAW+JPG. Saving to RAW takes substantially more time than saving to JPG format. When shooting action, I suggest you avoid the RAW formats.  The controls follow the Lumix pattern to date and are well spaced. You have 12 selectable modes from the main dial, which is nice, and many more accessible from the menu screens. You can acheive full manual control of the camera which is unusual in a camera in this price range.  I have one criticism: the zoom control does not extend quite far enough off the main camera body. It is just a wee bit difficult to use. Not a big deal, but a bit of a bother. Zooming is smooth and fast.  Battery life also seems to be a bit lower than promised.  Overall, a great camera for anyone and beyond great for those who want the enormous zoom range of this camera. The additional wide-angle range on the low end is fantastic - and being able to zoom to 504mm is just awesome.Jerry", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "As good as it gets before a dSLR", "Author": "ubat", "ReviewID": "RBRPDA7Z727V3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned Olympus, Minolta and Canon digital cameras, I was somewhat reluctant to go through a new brand's learning curve, but on paper the FZ18 had everything I wanted, so I went for it. I use digitals mostly for wildlife and nature photography, therefore optical zoom, image stabilization, fast focusing capability and good handling of low-light situations were my main priorities. I didn't want to shift to dSLRs mainly because of weight issues; I was looking for a compromise, for something that would give me flexibility and quality without the hassle. I have to say that, after several weeks of subjecting this camera to everything that came my way, I am pleasantly surprised. The FZ18 is FAST, especially with a SDHC card (check that your card reader handles these, otherwise get a newer reader), and although I usually work with the optical zoom fully extended and no tripod, there has been no shake. This camera does well in low natural light, focuses ultrafast, colors are mostly true (sometimes it oversaturates reds a tad)and below ISO 400 there is no discernible noise -- I never use anything above that anyway. I have control over all the settings, too, but if I get lazy I can let the camera do all the thinking for me: it does equally well as a point-and-shot and as an advanced amateur camera. I like that I can extend zoom even more if I reduce resolution. Menus are intuitive and I've had no trouble learning how to handle them. The one thing I don't like much are the proprietary batteries: I'd rather be able to use AA's. But this is a minor setback, considering all the FZ18's qualities.January 2008: After using this camera for a few months and taking a couple thousand pictures (bird photos: if you're lucky, one in ten is passable!), I stand by what I said before. But there is one issue that I perceived over time, and that has been annoying me. There is a tiny lag between pressing the button and the camera actually registering the image (optical zoom fully extended, maximum resolution). This tiny lag has made me lose a lot of pictures, especially of birds in flight. I've been trying to learn to compensate for it, but I can't say I've been successful -- understandably, since birds don't always fly predictable paths...  This lag isn't bothersome when you're shooting landscapes or slow moving objects. I never perceived this with my previous camera, a Canon S3 IS, and I'd like to know from other users if they have noticed this in the FZ18 as well.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Ideal Bridge Camera", "Author": "Think Twice", "ReviewID": "R167VWDJ9ZLN8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The space between point-and-shoot and dSLR's is seeing a lot of action, with manufacturers trying to offer dSLR features in a smaller form, economical package.From my perspective (serious amateur),The Deal-Maker features:The 28-504mm, in 35mm equivalent terms, of the 18X optical zoom lens (Leica) places it in a rare category. The Extended Zoom (EZ) feature takes it up to 23X. Until recently, zoom on these type of cameras was 10x to 12x, now we are seeing 18x in the market. More importantly, at the lower zoom end, the 28mm wide angle was the feature I was sold on, it's the one to go for when shooting group pictures or landscape.  The one package versatility of the lens will be found in only bridge cameras, better zoom than P&S; and no carrying/changing lenses as in dSLR's.The size/shape/weight of the camera is another factor to consider. It's much smaller than an dSLR with 18X lens, is comfortable to hold, and remains relatively steady when shooting. Of course, this is not a pocket camera. Despite the large lens, it's light and is easy to carry around.While the current price is around 379/399, shopping around should give uncover a 330 price. That's a deal.Features-to-like,It's iAuto mode makes it as easy as a P&S; to take pictures, but better, it adjusts ISO and selects the scene and determines the settings.Face detection works very well, I tried it for stage performances with kids dancing on stage and it worked majority of the times even when fully zoomed.The Joy stick is a joy, intuitive, and with a well laid out menu options, very easy to use.Optical Image stabilization is a must and FZ18 does an admirable job.Better processing engine, the Venus III is faster and noise is reduced.Has extensive manual control, albeit without the focus ring. It has the Program mode, and then Aperture, Shutter priority, and then fully manual. Multiple focusing, metering, and white balancing options gives many hours of fiddling and learning better photography thus.Many preset modes, which drill down further for specific settings are easy to use.Fast lens and focusing, short shutter lag.Features that are nice but expected,Rotating dial on the top is easy to manoeuvre, lens cap warning, quick review, slide show, 16:9 format (it's just cropped), battery good for 300-350 photos when fully charged, burst mode, and bracket exposure. Accommodates SDHC cards, so can go upto 4G card. Takes decent video but can't change zoom when activated.

Hicks-Bartlett \"terrapin99\"", "ReviewID": "R37WFAKHNI37F7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ18K ultra zoom for less than two weeks. I've made close to 800 or more shots with it. I love this camera! I selected it after doing extensive research on other camera in this price and performance range. I had decided to purchase the Olympus SP 560 UZ as I have a special fondness for this camera manufacturer (I'm still eyeing its E-510 DSLR as a future purchase). However, when I learned that the Olympus SP uses nonstandard storage cards, I decided that the Panasonic won out. Besides, the Panasonic has a slightly wider and longer zoom.I'm an avid reader of product manuals--I even read the poorly written ones. This one is fairly well written, straightforward and the text actually relates to the functions, which some manuals never quite seem to master. I've read and studied the Lumix manual closely. With one exception, I've used all the exposure mode settings and I've tried out all the features of the subcategory settings. For example, I've shot many statues and buildings in Aperture priority (my favorite exposure mode), Manual, (my second favorite mode), and in Intelligent Auto mode (iA).  But I've also gone inside the menus to find the categories under the \"SCN\" mode to set the features to \"sunset.\" Alternatively, I've use the \"Scenery\" mode, then delved deeper to venture inside the menu to select \"Architecture.\"  Reaching the menu selections is intuitive once you understand the basic structure you can easily find your way around and make settings quickly. If you read the manual while sitting with the camera you can try out the features as you read along.These special settings inside the menu really take much of the guesswork out of your picture taking.  I prefer having the greatest control over my camera features by being able to make finer adjustments than allowed in the auto modes. Please don't think that scrolling through menus is necessary to take great pictures with this camera. It is not. You can set it to \"P\" for Program (Auto Exposure) and shoot away! This is also possible shooting in the Intelligent Auto mode. If you only want to point & shoot (P&S;), you can. Although, frankly, I'm not sure why anyone would purchase this great little camera and choose only to P&S.; The features on this camera beg to be explored and if you do, it will take your photography skills to the next level.Soon after the camera arrived, I was shooting after the 120 minutes needed to charge the battery. That was just enough time to read the manual the first time. I'd also highly recommend reading some of the online reviews of this camera, like at Camera Labs, where you can see an actual demonstration of the camera's features--that certainly will helped shorten the learning curve.Specifics I like: The size. By adult women standards, I have very small hands. This camera fits in my hand like a glove! I love it. It reminds me of my old Olympus OM-1 film camera from the 70s, which was considered small back then. By the way, I still use this camera! The Lumix FZ18K has its major dial at the top of the camera, nicely placed. I can actually hold the camera in my right hand and use my fingers to turn the mode dial! The back of the camera has a 2.5 LCD that is bright and easy to see. What is quite cool is the viewfinder. It's an EVF (electronic viewfinder). I'm still a little stuck in the 70s and I like looking through that tiny window to compose. I see most digital users holding the camera out in front of them to compose. I'm learning that there's a time a place for both methods and I'm learning to use the bright LCD monitor. One huge plus to the electronic viewfinder is being able to rely on it when shooting in bright light. The screen is easier to see from the EVF than it is from the LCD monitor. The Lumix also has a diopter adjustment near the viewfinder that allows finer EVF tweaking by moving a tiny wheel adjacent to it. This is a huge plus and if you wear glasses or could use a little vision help.While I've tried all the exposure modes, here is the exception. I have not spent any time with the motion picture mode. I will in due time. I'm so impressed with the still camera functions I just haven't had time. I must say something about the lens. It's fantastic! It's a Leica lens, so one would expect it to be great--and it is. Very sharp. This is an ultra zoom, with the ability to take super close-up. I just started testing that and shot some fun pictures of a squirrel and birds. I was pleased with my novice results.On a camera like this, one would expect some innovative features. This camera doesn't disappoint. It has image stabilization, which I must admit at first I didn't get. But I was testing it indoors, making it harder to appreciate its results. The manual will tell you that in very low light situation it might not work as well. When I used it outside, there is no problem. It works! Focusing in \"M\" (manual) mode is aided by the LCD screen magnifying a small portion of the scene that you use as a focusing guide. Really a neat feature. The camera allows you to shoot in black and white, adjust color balance, determine the mega pixels you'll use, and very important to me, shoot in RAW, JPEG and RAW+JPEG. At first, I thought that the battery seemed to drain rather quickly but actually, I may be the blame for that. I've had days of shooting far more shoots than 100 pics and felt I had to return home to recharge. How many more pictures I could have taken before actually running out of juice, I don't know. Still, I'm purchasing an extra battery so I can change in the field if necessary. Another plus, some cameras allow for either single file deletion or \"Delete All.\" You'll love the Lumix's ability to easily mark multiple files, simultaneously, for deletion and keep only what you want.Now, one thing about which one should be aware: This is only an issue if you're looking for total control over creativity and camera features. The widest aperture is f2.8, which is fine for most of us. If you want to throw the background out of focus, this should be sufficient. If, however, you're accustomed to a good 50mm lens with an f1.8 or f1.4, which will allow you to work a bit easier in low light situations, you might miss these wider apertures. Again, most people won't care about this at all.If you're on the fence about which advanced compact, ultra zoom, bridge digital to purchase, you will be thrilled with the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ18K.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best advanced point and shoot out there", "Author": "Jay Y.

However, they are not always ideal to travel with or taking out to friend's houses or nights on the town.  I bought this Panasonic because it is small yet powerful enough to take more advanced pictures (not just the quick point and shoot).So far, I'm really impressed with the camera.  The optics are top-notch.  The glass is able to resolve the finest details.  As far as point and shoot lenses go, the glass in this Panasonic is absolutely incredible.  They are simply the best you'll get in non SLR cameras.The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the noise that appears in some pictures when using higher iso settings.  Perhaps I'm spoiled from the low-noise pictures from my DSLRs.  Panasonic put the best glass in this camera, but ultimately limited the camera's performance by using the small, noisy sensors.Is it still a great camera?  Yes, absolutely.  All little point and shoot cameras are crippled by the same sensor noise, so this Panasonic is no different.  However, the glass is wonderful.  The zoom is excellent.

The latest in their megazoom FZ line is this - the FZ 18, so called because of a 28mm-504mm 18x zoom.Those optics are the first of three great things about this camera. The lens is sharp and produces remarkably little distortion, a great achievement for a camera of this zoom range.Second is the optical image stabilization - as Panasonic calls it, MEGA OIS. This feature, one of the best available in the market, helps to steady the camera which allows for clearer hand-held shots than was possible before stabilization, which makes the long end of the zoom truly useful.Third is the ergonomics and ease of use. The idiot-proof Intelligent Auto mode gets the shot right most of the time and the camera is fun to use with well-placed controls and a functional body.Other, less defining achievements are fast response times, good battery life, excellent flash recycling times, a useful burst mode, and customizable shooting settings.That said, there are some faults that inevitably come from the megazoom design - an irritatingly small sensor that will be prone to noise.As I'm sure most photographic enthusiasts and electrical engineers will agree, the tiny design of such a chip will create electrical noise, indistinguishable from picture detail, which means in low light (and thus high ISOs), the pictures come out grainy. To correct for this, the camera processes the picture, reducing detail even more to smear out the noise.However, this isn't the end of the world. First, the noise is nearly invisible on small prints - so if you only make small prints, no one would even notice. Second, the FZ-18's noise isn't much worse than its competitors such as the Olympus SP 550 and 560 UZ. And third, better than many of its competitors, the FZ-18 allow for the user to adjust the amount of noise reduction and also supports RAW output, which retains the detail for processing later.Its movie mode is acceptable but not great. It can't zoom while filming and it doesn't have stereo sound like the Canon S5 IS does. If you want that, this camera might not be for you. Get a camcorder instead.Another problem is the blue banding effect, which creates a large band of blue color on the left hand side of the picture under special conditions, but will almost never show in real-world shots. This problem seems to vary from camera to camera and Panasonic (as of X-mas time 2007) is working on a fix.Movie mode (which I hardly use) and the blue band problem (a nuisance that is rarely seen in real life) aside, the only major drawback this camera has is its noise, a zit upon the forehead of photographic greatness. And although this is annoying, it's the same problem present in all megazoom cameras, which in this case is more than made up for by the ease of use and incredibly useful zoom range.Overall, a good - though not faultless - camera that is probably the best-of-the-bunch of the megazoom range. Get to know its limitations and adjust your preferences, and it will give you excellent results. If you don't want to bother, put it in the Intelligent Auto mode and it will do fine all by itself.As a side note, if you truly wanted to get away from noise, get a DSLR, but don't expect to be able to use the same zoom range without constantly changing lenses.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Getting better all the time", "Author": "D.

Newkirk", "ReviewID": "R1EHVUFSQ5FGPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a quality SLR with image stabilization and love it.  I use primarily prime (non-zoom) lenses (with low f-stops, typically better than F 2.0) with my SLR in order to take pictures in low-light situations indoors.  You cannot beat it for that.  I also own a few zooms for it, up to 500mm (750mm equivalent).  However, the FZ18 Lumix has some features that made me buy it instead of just settling for my SLR.  Here are some of the advantages that I found:1. Size - you have 28mm to 500mm (with respectable f-stop speed) and macro all in one compact body.  A definite advantage when you want to travel small and/or light.  Some of the reasons Panasonic (and other manufacturers) were able to do this are listed below.2.  Sensor Efficiency - the sensor on most of the digital cameras (including most SLRs) is much smaller than film, therefore you don't need to have as large of a lens physically.  Also, if you use a smaller lens, you can also use a smaller body, hence a greatly reduced size for the camera and the ability to incorporate a greater zoom range and faster lens.3.  SLR Efficiency - An SLR uses a mirror to transfer the image to the viewfinder and must flip out of the way in order to take a picture (a time-consuming process that restricts the speed of flash synchronizations, among other things).  Since a digital camera reads the image anyway, it can be transmitted to the screen or viewfinder (which is a little screen you view) without sacrificing the \"through the lens\" advantages, but not needing the cumbersome mirror-flipping, hence a more compact camera.  The absence of the mirror also makes sharper pictures due to less vibration.4.  Optical Image Stabilization - Many SLRs have such a feature, but it is usually by being built into an expensive lens.  I own a Pentax SLR, which has it built into the camera, but it has been shown that a camera like the Lumix has as good or better stabilization than the typical SLRs do and you get it through the whole spectrum of the capabilities of this fantastic lens.5.  Fast Telephoto - I don't even want to think about how much a 500mm F4 lens costs (much less carry one around), but that is what you get with this camera.  With the combination of image stabilization, I can take pictures that were impossible before.  (See the image in the image gallery.)6.  No removable lens - I know this is an advantage of SLRs, but it is also a disadvantage, as it allows dust, etc. to enter in to the inside of the camera between the lens and where the picture is recorded (the sensor).7.  Cost - $300+?  I paid $500 for a manual focus 200mm F2.8 lens alone.  Most SLR bodies cost more than $300, even used (for digital, of course).  To replicate what this camera can do photographically in an SLR format, you would have to spend many times the price of this camera.8.  Tripod - the smaller the camera, the smaller the tripod that's needed.  You can get away with a tiny little thing for this lightweight.Now, some disadvantages of this camera compared to the SLRs:1.  Flash - Point and shoot flashes are typically inadequate, sometimes terribly so.  This one has no hot-shoe for an add-on.  My solution is that I virtually never use the flash (I have to confess I haven't even tried it out yet on this camera, but I do not have ANY grandiose expectations).2.  SLR Prime speed - I have a 50mm F1.4 lens that can do things this camera can't, problem is, it is only one lens size, so I also have a 20mm F1.8.  However, if you're not using prime lenses, this Lumix will match or beat almost any of your zooms for f-stop speed.3.  SLR manual control  - manual focus is easy on an SLR, and sometimes manual focus is MUCH preferred over auto-focus.  Though this camera has a manual focus capability, it is cumbersome and a bit complicated.  Most SLR lenses (especially primes) have scales for depth of field, which can be EXTREMELY useful.  Also, the same is true for manual exposures.  On an SLR, you can sometimes go to F22, F32 or even F45 for extra depth of field.  Not so on the Lumix - F8.0 is the limit.  By the way, the best way to do a panorama that you are going to stitch together is to do a fixed manual exposure on the shots, so that they will blend well.I'm still going to use my SLR, but I may consider selling all my non-prime lenses for it.

I also reviewed the  Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)--a fine camera and my choice for a pocket sized camera that is ready to go. Neither camera is perfect, but overall I was pleased with these cameras.The FZ18 is the bridge model for Lumix cameras and it was reviewed in some travel magazines and in Digital Photographer, which compared it to Fujifilm S8000fd (rated 90%) & Olympus SP 560 UZ (rated 86%)--the Lumix was rated #1 at 96%. Out of the box, the pictures were a bit flat and the colors a bit off and less vibrant than the model. The camera needed to be adjusted for color and contrast, but this is a relatively minor considering you can get some very nice, clear shots. The fact it wasn't ready to go out of the box lowered my rating to 4 stars. I uploaded some sample photos.Pros: More options and programming available than for a conventional point & shoot. Great 18x optical zoom, but use a tripod or monopod for best shot. Mega OIS stabilization is great and you can get some decent zoom & macro shots handheld. Leica lens is a saving grace, producing some nice crisp shots. Can pre-program 3 of your most used scene options and switch so you don't have to fuss with adjustments every shot. Burst mode, bracketing also available. Lightweight and small for a fairly powerful camera with lots of options. Feels comfortable and easy in your hand--great for women who generally have smaller hands and those who don't want to be lifting hefty cameras and multiple lenses around. Menus were easy to learn. Has eyepiece with adjustment wheel for those of us with less than perfect eyesight. Large LCD. RAW available. Inexpensive so overall a great value and camera.Cons: Since I found colors a bit flat, almost exclusively shoot in Program mode so iA (intelligent autofocus) is kind of wasted. Autofocus didn't do as well in low light and shots were grainy but not an issue if you mostly shoot in daylight plus few point & shoot cameras photograph well in low light. LCD has clear shiny \"window\" that gets \"fingerprinty\" (I use a microfiber eyeglass cloth to keep it clean) and may scratch eventually (but by then I will probably be ready to buy a new camera). There are LCD protectors available if you want those. 8.1 MP decent, but would wish for higher MP--however not an issue if you don't do extensive cropping or blow up pictures to large sizes such as poster sized. Would also like to see swing/tilt LCD--great for when you are shooting above your head, but many cameras don't have this option either.I found this filter set which also appears to be a pretty good value if you want filters Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18 - 46mm High Resolution 3-piece Filter Set (UV, Fluorescent, Polarizer) - Silver (not Panasonic Brand)Verdict: A fun camera. Great if you want to step up from a conventional pocket sized point & shoot to something with a few more features and don't want the expense and hassle of carrying around a DSL with lenses. Great travel camera. Inexpensive price makes it a great value. Overall I was very pleased with the FZ18. I have not tried the Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) which seems to have more options and is closer to DSL, but it is also more expensive, so overall I think the FZ18 is a great option if you don't want to spend $500 or $600 but want to have a camera that gives you more creative freedom than a regular point and shoot. As I use the camera more, I will update this review with more info.Thanks to those who post honest reviews of Amazon--they have really helped me make some product choices. I hope I have helped some consumers in return.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "The FZ18 is a real winner!", "Author": "avsroy", "ReviewID": "R2ZOK4ISWTNLW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Panasonic camera - the first one was a VHS-C Camcorder (NV VS7 EG) that I had bought in Oct 2000 and it is still working fine :-) Over the years I have owned and used other Digital cameras / brands e.g. Canon S400, S410, Fuji F10 and F30. The F30 is still my favorite for low light indoor / party photos, but when I step outdoors, the FZ18 just cannot be beaten. I did agonize over my decision for several weeks comparing with the Fuji SF8000fd and Olympus 560UZ and of course, the Panasonic TZ3. However my previous experience with Panasonic products and a great deal on Amazon for the FZ18 (from Vanns) clinched the decision last month. Yes, the images do get noisy at higher ISO's so pixel peepers will not be satisfied and it does not fit into a pocket. However, the Leica lens coupled with the OIS and in-camera processing provides outstanding results with minimal efforts. The zoom is fantastic and the digital zoom works well at a pinch. In addition, you can take over as much control as you like - going upto full manual on exposure and focusing and even fine tuning the white balance. If you are a snapshooter, switch it to the iA mode and let the camera do all the hard work. The flash is powerful enough for most social occasions (although I will still use my F30 for low light snap shooting) and the camera powers up very quickly - so you will not miss a shot and finally battery life is good as well. So if you want to have fun with photography and not blow a hole in your bank account, then this is the camera to go for.

One is more of a point and shoot while the other, the DMC-FZ20, is a fixed lens SLR.The FZ18 is an excellent camera for everyday use and also for those of you who may want to control your photos more directly.The main reason I got this camera was because of the massive zoom as well as the wide angle ability all in one fixed lens.  My FZ20 has a massive telephoto as well, but not the wide angle option built in like the FZ18.Another nice change that I found with this camera is the addition of the joystick on the back panel.  The 4-way-regular selector that has always been on the back of Lumix cameras is still there and still controls the same exposure and flash intensity functions, but the joystick lets you make very quick aperture and shutter speed changes that were a bit harder to do on earlier models.The photo quality is excellent as well.The only thing that I am not 100% happy with is the small size of this camera.  My FZ20 is a normal SLR sized camera that fits into my hand normally.  The FZ18 is smaller and it almost makes my hand feel cramped when I am holding it and trying to get to a function with the 4-way dial or the joystick.If you can live with that small size factor then this camera is something you should seriously consider.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA AT A GREAT PRICE!!", "Author": "E. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1LIL42A782PKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my beginning photography class.  It met all the requirements I had and more.  I spent some time reading all the possible reviews out there and compared it to many of the camera in its class. The Panasonic FZ18 has been rated the top of the the superzoom so that knocked out most of the competing cameras.  It really came down to this camera or the Canon S5.  However, Panasonic won me over because of several things;1. Wide Angle (Canon S5 no wide angle)2. 18x Optical Zoom (Canon S5 at 12x, not that big of a deal but still a plus for Panasonic)3. RAW Image Format (I like the ability to process my own image)4. LiON Battery (I prefer this to 4 double AA's, small recharge adapter, one solid battery pack instead of a clutter of 4 double AA's, weighs less)5. Image Stabilization (On par with Canon's)6. Leica DC VARIO-ELMARIT LensAlthough the Canon S5 Image quality is much better than Panasonic's at base ISO, Canon S5 has a lot more noise at 400+.  And at 800+, it's pretty much unusable.  Although any non-DSLR type cameras will have a lot more noise, I think that the Panasonic FZ18 has a lot less noise than all the other cameras.  Yes most places say that it has noise at all range of ISO, but I prefer barely noticeable noise at low ISO and decent image quality from mid to high iso rather than no noise at lowest iso setting and then all other iso settings are mush.  That's why I chose it over the Canon S5 even though at 80 ISO, Canon's image is super sharp. Too bad Panasonic doesn't have a swivel lcd screen and a hot shoe.  Also, Canon S5 can take images up to 0cm away compared to Panasonic's 1cm, I thought about that and decided I probably wouldnt want to put anything close to my camera lens anyway and risk damaging it.My first impressions of the camera was that it's a lot smaller than it looks in pictures, and it's super light! I held the Canon S5 in stores and it's a little bit lighter than the Canon.  Oh one thing i noticed was that i could feel the lens move when I tilt the camera back and forth.  I was scared that it was broken until I read this info sheet that came with the camera saying if you hear noises that's just the lens moving when the camera is shaken.  As long as it's not broken, phew. Even though it's light and makes a little noise, it still feels pretty solid and durable.  I mean, no one should go around shaking their camera like a spray can anyways.  With the batteries inside, the camera feels a lot more solid and the weight is just right.  This camera looks a lot better than the Canon S5 to me and it feels more comfortable to hold (I keep the  hood adapter attach to extend the lens barrel and this helps with the look of the camera and also at 0X the lens doesn't stick out).  After taken several pictures I must say I was really impressed, in good lighting it was spectacular (at 100 ISO in good lighting I can't see any noise!), in low lighting conditions it was still good. The image stabilizer on this camera does its job, I can nail a perfectly clear shot at 18x handheld at 1/30.  That's good enough me.In conclusion, the Panasonic FZ18 is great camera, has well-rounded image quality, and the product just feels tighter and more hassle free. If you want anything better than this, then you really need to get a DSLR.  Saying that, you have to keep in mind the price difference, the larger size, heavier weight, and having to carry a million lenses and accessories.  (Those people who gave this camera a low rating because of noise are just not in the right market, you can't compare it to a DSLR!) I give this camera 4 out of 5 for being on the high end of its class, and offering maximum quality at an affordable price. There's still room for improvements like a swivel screen, hot shoe and the jpeg engine could be better.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lumix FZ-18 is a fantastic all around camera", "Author": "Cary's Camera \"Digital Camera FAN\"", "ReviewID": "R2JIWN0WPJVHM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews before purchasing this camera.

Mack", "ReviewID": "R71UK1EB6BC3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like anybody reading this, I did a lot of research on digital cameras.  Obviously, my final choice was this camera, it beat out the Olympus, Nikon, Canon, and Fujifilm models that offer 12x-18x zoom.First, there are two well-documented concerns about this camera that are posted in any decent review and most of the Amazon user reviews:(1) Shutter lag(2) High ISO causes terrible noiseThese were the two concerns I thought may affect me when using this camera, but I decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway.  I'll spend most of my time here on these issues, because when I was researching, they were the topics I was most interested in reading about.(1) The shutter lag issue is noticable right away.  It isn't bad to the point where it will cause you to lose many normal-motion pictures, but you will miss some random movment, high-speed shots(as many have mentioned, shooting birds is an adventure).  To put some sort of measure to this I attempted to shoot my dog running at full speed about 10 feet away.  The delay between my pressing the shutter button and the resulting picture was enough time for the dog to move about two feet.  For me, this isn't a very big issue.  If you are shooting high-speed action shots there is always an element of anticipation (or luck) involved, no matter what camera you use.  Soon enough you will learn the delay and be able to get a reasonable estimate to take decent action shots as long as you can somewhat predict the direction of the motion.  Also, the burst shot mode will drastically increase your chances to catch that tough action shot.(2) The other issue, ISO-related noise, is another story.  I had to go in and manually select the setting to get to the point to where I saw this issue.  I took hundred's of pictures without noticing, I finally set the ISO to 1600 to match the results every internet review has posted.  With the ISO at 800 in low-light situations(and no flash), the noise was not a big issue, if you print a 4x6 with those settings you will not notice.  At 1600 it is very obvious, if you have any interest in shooting at varying ISO levels, this isn't the camera for you.  However, for hundred's of normal use pictures this was never an issue, and even with some set shots at higher ISO's, it won't come into play unless you want a very large prinout.  Still, this is definitely an issue for anybody concerned about shooting on variable ISO levels and expecting the same results at 100 and 1600.The positive features of the camera are numerous:  Great picture quality, great image stabilization, 18x zoom, RAW image mode, every manual control you can expect from a P&S;, and many more.The image quality is staggering, using JPEG 8mp mode, I uploaded the an image taken at 18x zoom on the camera to my 19\" monitor(at full resolution) and then zoomed into the image on my computer substantially(to the point where the image on the screen was about 1/10th of the original image) and there was no noticable pixalation.  Very impressive, especially taken at full-zoom.  I'll also mention the image stabalization, I've seen some negative mentions of this, but I absolutely love this feature and it works exactly as advertised.  I have horrible camera hands, constantly shaking which was very noticable on my old P&S;, but the IS on this camera has been outstanding, I can't imagine how many 18x zoom pictures I would have to immediately delete if it weren't for the quality IS processing.  The camera defaults to level 1, I switched over to level 2 which is more powerful.This camera is for you if:  You don't want to make the jump to a dSLR, you want a powerful zoom capable of producing high-quality images that you can print out at sizes bigger than 8x10 and you want to be able to control the settings in detail, but also pick it up and let the auto-settings do the work and still get great shots.This camera is not for you if:  You place a very high value on high-speed action shots or you have a special interest in varying the ISO settings.There is a ton about this camera I didn't touch on, I'll let the professional reviews handle those issues, but the bottom line is that this is an exceptional top-of-the-line P&S; camera.  If you can conceed a couple of points upfront as not being big issues to you, then I 100% recommend this camera to you.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great most of the time", "Author": "Eric \"goodadvice75\"", "ReviewID": "RB5BVDB1CLDLD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the DMC FZ 18 for about 1 month now and I am mostly satisfied with my purchase. The camera takes good pictures most of the time, especially outside or with flash indoors. I am giving the camera 3 stars because even outdoors the camera is a little heavy handed in noise reduction when the light is not perfect. In shadow outside the camera tends to lose detail. Given the price range and the target audience for this camera that is not acceptable.A way around the picture quality problem is try shooting important pictures - like group pictures - from various angles and with flash even outside. Taking several pictures in auto mode and from the same position does not do the trick, you have to change the light.If you are looking for a point and shoot camera that can pictures fast, then this camera is a good choice. If you are obsessed with picture quality, then you might want to consider spending a little more and getting a dslr (wish I did). This camera takes better pictures than most point and shoot cameras, but can't compete with a dslr. In so far it is not really a bridge model, because in regard to ability to influence settings and picture quality the model leans toward the point and shoot class.If you get the camera, consider getting a 8 gb card with it. The camera is pretty fast for a point and shoot and you will take a lot of pictures. A 1 or 2 gb card will constrain you. 4 or 8 gb gives you enough room for a day of picture taking. Also, if you ever consider taking pictures in raw mode, you really need the 8gb because those files are huge.I use scandisk extreme III 4 and 8 gb cards with this camera. Both are excellent cards - fast and durable - and work well with the camera.The pros of the camera are:* light and not too bulky* camera easy to hold even with one hand - solid feel and nice grip on right side* takes excellent pictures most of the time* the menus are mostly intuitive* great display - even outside in sunlight* battery plenty good for a day of shooting* fast - for \"normal\" picture taking, haven't tried sports events yet.Negatives:* sometimes just plain bad pictures even outside in ok light* documentation for this camera is limited at best* ability to influence settings somewhat limited* can't zoom in movie mode.", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Bargain", "Author": "Native Art Collector", "ReviewID": "RC0ER2AFZOKWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my camera professionally as a photojournalist.

Image quality is fantastic, and looks great on not only the camera screen, but on my computer screen, and on paper.Others have mentioned no zoom on the camcorder mode: they're right...you cant control the zoom in camcorder mode. HOWEVER! If you're already zoomed in while in another mode, and flip over to the camcorder, then it stays zoomed in. You cant zoom out without stopping the recording and changing modes, so that's a drawback, but this is not a camcorder...it's a digital camera with a camcorder mode...I'll take it!All in all, this is an excellent camera with more features than I know what to do with.

While it's capable of taking photos in low light, if you want great quality, use the flash or put it on a tripod and set it to a very slow speed. Without doing this, your pictures will be grainy. With the flash, they're beautiful and crystal clear.I also like the backlight compensation. It really solves the problem of an overly bright background and is so easy to use. The camera is not totally intuative, but is mostly so. Once you figure the out the menu system, the rest is easy.One other problem I had was finding a good bag.

I did a considerable amount of research at professional photography websites, Amazon.com, blogs, etc. and came to the conclusion that the Lumix would be significantly better than the Canon.  All the research was CORRECT.I am extremely happy with the Lumix.  Its vast array of manual and automatic settings combined with the excellent performance of the Leica lens put this into the very high end of the \"prosumer\" category.My first test, which was also the case with my Canon, was to take close up pictures of flamingos at the zoo.  After shooting with the Lumix, I compared the pictures with the Canon shots, and the difference was night and day.  Focus, sharpness, color balance and saturation were all dramatically better.  The \"iA\" or intelligent automatic setting is truly a marvel since it detects the type of scene (macro, backlit, distant scenery, portrait, etc.) you are trying to shoot, and immediately makes all the adjustments to make the best pictures.Manual settings are also very easy to use with a lot of viewfinder aids and an excellent joystick.  Even the manual focus is a vast improvement over the Canon variety.  I could actually focus with precision using the excellent viewfinder and joystick adjustments.My only SLIGHT reservation with the camera is its finish.  It is surprisingly light, and this is largely because it is almost 100% plastic.  Thus, it does not have the heft and quality finish of the Canon.  Having said that, the reason we buy a certain camera is to take excellent pictures, not to flaunt the camera itself, so I did not downgrade my rating for the camera's lack of a beautiful appearance.  There is also an upside: with far less weight, you hardly notice it is hanging from your shoulder.All in all, the things that truly matter to me in a camera are all found in the Lumix, and for this reason, I highly recommend it.

My results are quite similar to those obtained from S2IS- Low light performance: I have read advice that this is not the camera to take to dinner parties - mainly due to lack of focusing ability in low light. My hit rate has been quite good - not far beneath the old S2.To sum up, yes the camera suffers from some short comings, just like any other comparable model out in the market, specially in this price bracket.

I wanted a camera that was a point and shoot camera, but not quite a SLR.  I found this camera to be the perfect fit.  It's fairly small, but not ultra compact by any means.  It doesn't have interchangeable lenses, but it does have adapters that allow you to add on extensions and expand it.  The 18x optical zoom (key there is that it's optical, not digital - although it does have an optional digital zoom to) is really good.  Another seller for me is the lithium ion battery pack (at the time of purchase, this was not common in cameras).  The charger for this comes with the camera and holds a charge for a really long time.  No longer do I have to purchase batteries or have to deal with those 1.2 vol rechargeable AA's.  This is a money saver that helps to justify the cost of the camera (although comparatively, when you look at the features and specs - even the MSRP is a good price).  It's got a full auto mode, a full manual mode, a shutter priority mode and a aperture priority mode.  It takes good videos too.  There's other small features that are handy such as face detection mode and various scene selections and the ability to switch between auto or manual white balance and various presets.  It can work with a SD memory card, but the device is also rated for and recommends SDHC.  I have a SDHC card and it works really good.  I can't really come up with any bad side to this camera.  I highly recommend it.  The full auto is good for a novice or just somebody who wants to make sure you're getting the right exposure.  The full manual mode gives you total control over the exposure.  I highly recommend this camera to anybody - especially if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive camera to hold you off until you can afford the full blown digital SLR with lenses that by themselves would cost as much as this camera.(edited on 7/25/2012 to fix typos and make the review more relevant to current times)", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Loved since I opened it", "Author": "Nestor Jarquin Zeas", "ReviewID": "R3BDQ5C1O3ACNU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently wanted to upgrade from a simple point & shoot to something with a  little more manual control, without spending a whole lot of money on a DSLR and here's what I got....

I just got the camera, charged the battery and starting taking shots, and even using the IA (intelligent auto) mode the pictures are VERY VERY GOOD! Actually, according to some of the reviews I found here, I was expecting a little less quality on the pics but they were more than good.The feel is pretty good, nice grip and it feels really comfortable in your hands (doesn't feel cheap at all!!!) The camera is not bulky, you probably wont want to put it in your pocket, unless you want everybody to stare at your leg like somethings coming out of it though....Zooming is very smooth and focusing doesn't take long at all...When I first fully charged the battery, it took like 10 minutes of video and like 200 pictures to drain it almost completely, which I think is very good.The menu is very intuitive, and if you know what you're doing it'll be a lot easier to manually adjust the camera settings.In conclusion, I would strongly recommend this camera for people who are not willing to pay for a DSLR or probably think it's too complicated (like myself LOL) and you won't be disappointed...

I've had three film SLRs (Contax, Nikon, Pentax), and have always thought I like the weight and heft of those, and that therefore I would find this one a little too light. I still like the weight and heft, but I got quickly used to the lightweight-ness, if you like, of the FZ18. It's nice. Easy to quickly lift and take pix.And it is very easy to use -- right out of the box you can be taking very satisfactory pictures, without fiddling with lots of controls.At the low end (wide-angle) of the zoom, the picture quality is spot-on, sharp and vivid. I like this a lot, and it reminds me why I prefer close-up photography to long-distance.Still, the telephoto end of the lens seems to me to decrease image quality quite significantly. I'm no expert who can count pixels and noise and so forth, so I'm just talking about looking at the results, and I'm less than happy with my telephoto pictures. Definite lack of sharpness, loss of detail.One thing that has surprised me is that in Aperture Priority when you go one stop smaller, for example, the shutter speed chosen doesn't decrease by half, which is the equation (and behaviour) from using my film cameras. I presume similar behaviour in SP.

I absolutely love this camera!!!!  I researched my purchase by reading the reviews and looking at customer images for some 20-odd cameras from different manufacturers.  Majority of the time my research led me right back to the Panasonic Lumix line of cameras.  I asked a few friends who are photo enthusiasts and they all seemed to point in the same direction.  I finally decided to purchase this one after narrowing down my choices (a major feat for me) to three different cameras and realizing this was the only one of those 3 that had an actual battery pack.  After using my other camera for the last three years and watching it eat 4 AA batteries at a time I couldn't help but to refuse to purchase another battery muncher.  I was willing to spend the extra for an backup battery pack so I didn't have to worry about fumbling around with all the AA's. This camera lasted through about 300 or so photos taken at max resolution and about 10 minutes of video shooting.  I'm not sure if those numbers are right, but I definately used the mess out of it playing around and it lasted through about 4 hours of play.  Surprisingly this camera (even though it's about 50% larger than my other) is fairly light and fits nicely in your hands.My husband is now telling me that I am rambling on about a camera that I've only had for a little over 24 hours so I will stop here and let the photos show the quality of this camera.

The camera did not disappoint.  I was able to get a lot of great shots: from zooms to panoramas, under varying light conditions (I didn't try anything faster than ISO400).  The resolution is great:  I can blow up my pictures and they still look good.  To top it off, you can shoot video with it also (30 fps), in either 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio.I had also bought and charged two spare batteries (no place to charge batteries in the field north of the arctic circle...).  Didn't touch either one.  I shot 250 pictures and around 20 minutes of video over the course of 8 days in the field and only took my first battery down to one bar.For you ultra-serious camera geeks: Is it a full SLR?

This camera have an unbelievable zoom and the stabilization feature at full zoom is remarkable!I'm my opinion this camera fits the niche between point and shoot and DSLR perfectly and ESPECIALLY great considering the price point--less than $300!  We couldn't find a DSLR body for that price, and to find an 18x zoom lens...well we laughed ourselves right off the website when we saw the prices!We were very impressed by the quality feel/construction.  It is very easy to use right out of the box--and the auto picture setting selects the perfect exposure 9 out of 10 times.  We have taken thousands of pictures--the burst mode is phenomenal and there are many of manual options/controls for when/if you want to take the next step.Another nice feature is this camera can accept filters (46mm) which expands its versatility and reduces the need for excess photo-editing afterwards.I also really like the fact that the camera can take pictures in RAW format as well as RAW + JPEG which means you get a picture in both formats...just fantastic really and a feature we did not find available in competitors.I would highly recommend getting the biggest memory card you can afford as well as a couple of extra batteries - for those all day photo safaris/excursions.This camera does not disappoint!", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DC-18K Digital Camera", "Author": "Robert Till \"Bob Till\"", "ReviewID": "R21ZYLNS74TEI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this camera for a family reunion.

It is easy to use, simply put it in automatic mode and it takes nice pictures.  The zoom is incredible, almost should be illegal.  There are plenty of settings you can change, some can be a little confusing to find at first, but once you learn how things are set up in the menus, everything is easy to get at.  I'm a bit of a negative person so it is easier for me to cite some negatives but before I do, this camera is almost perfect for the amateur photographer, and I would recommend it highly.This camera is not an expensive SLR and the pictures are a bit grainy, particularly at full zoom.  I'm not talking blur, which the built in image stabilization handles well, just a tad grainy.  Shooting at 100 asa gets the best results. One important thing I didn't find out until AFTER I bought the camera is it will NOT use an SD card of 4 gigs or more UNLESS it is an SDHC card.  I had ordered a 4 gig SD card when I ordered the camera because my computer wouldn't read the SDHC format.  Anyway, works great with the 4 gig SDHC card which holds around 1000 pictures at full resolution (not raw of course). I mentioned the zoom is SUPER and it is, however it is a bit touchy to control and it's easy to over zoom when taking portraits.  A SLIGHTLY slower zoom would probably be a good idea.I had thought about getting an expensive SLR but I owned a film SLR years ago and not being a professional, I never bought additional lenses for it anyway, and a lot of the features I never used enough to get comfortable with, so I left that on automatic most of the time.  I figured why put all sorts of cash into a camera that you need to buy a separate lens for zoom and close ups?Anyway, you can read reviews of this camera all over the place, and for the most part, they are accurate.

Depending on the user you can let it fully take charge and do all the work, you can get partially or fully involved too. Either way the buttons/knobs are placed just right so you can tweak settings easily and quickly with your eye still on the subject. So why did I chose the Lumix?...well initially I thought about the Sony H50, it had a few nice gimmicks like Nightshot and flip out screen but frankly I couldn't see much practical use of those. The zoom of 15x put it in a league below(afterall that's what we want a big zoom for), though in precision mode you can increase zoom to 30x...thats 15x optical and 2x digital also in smart mode you could go up 81x but only in vga. My girlfriend has a W120 with 4x zoom, in smart mode it can go up to 19x in vga, just a look at that quality tells me 81x vga pix will be totally unusable. Compared to the Lumix's 72x at 8mp, 92x at 5mp and 115x at 3mp and the Sony was eliminated...FYI I've taken hundreds of shots now with full optical and digital zoom at all resolutions, they are very good, sure at the limits they aren't razor sharp but that's to be expected.Nikon's P80 was also in the running, but I heard that the threads on it's lens were just cosmetic, also that there were no filters available or intended. This for me put the P80 behind the Lumix.My other choices were the Olympus SP570 and SP560, both felt very good ergonomically in my hand, and quality grip too. They did feel more chunky in the hand then the lumix(note: the lumix feels light too).I wasn't keen on the zoom ring around lens barrel and it felt un-responsive when I tried it, so SP560 was bettered placed because it's zoom ring was like the Lumix. However both olympus models don't have threads on the len barrel so like the p80 can't use filters to even protect then lens. I'd seen a few custom adapters on the net and unfortunately they appear like a hat rim sitting on the end of the extended lens barrel, not a pretty sight.Ok so I could live with no lens protection if the reviews gave it higher marks in picture,noise quality than the Lumix. Well after reading scores of reviews, the Lumix was superior across the whole focal range and ISO range. Sure ther's noise at high end ISO and low light but it's not as bad as the competion.The reviews along with my earlier observations made the Lumix an easy choice. The fact that the manufacturers didn't even consider threads on the lens barrels tells me that their models are really just fancy advance point and shoots and not bridge cameras like the Lumix...but that's just me.....enjoy!!!!", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great compact body with huge zoom range", "Author": "Gregory W.

Even though the FZ-50 is larger and heavier and has a less extensive zoom range (12x instead of 18x), it was my camera of choice because of its manual zoom, which is so much easier to adjust precisely to the size you want instead of a thumb switch like on most other digicams, including the FZ-18, and also it has the great moveable LCD screen, allowing you to take overhead or down on the ground close-ups with ease.

I like the styling of bridge cameras and use them when I don't want to lug a digital or film SLR and its accessories around.  Shortly after receiving the FZ18K I went on a cruise to Alaska where I took several hundred pictures with the camera.  It did a spectacular job.  Although I also had a DSLR with me, the size and capabilities of the FZ18K proved very valuable on some of the shore excursions where I had some limitations on how much I could carry.  I did a lot of research before I purchased the camera and found that I concur with all of the positive reviews I read.  The camera does have a lot of functionality that takes a bit of time to understand but it can also be used as a point-and-shoot.  If the camera has any negatives, to me, it would be the way the lens shade mounts and that it can't be reversed on the camera for storage and the battery life is considerably less than advertised.

I took this camera to Alaska, and the 18X zoom was perfect for wildlife and aerial shots. I researched pretty extensively before buying, and this is the best camera of its kind for its price.

Nice and sturdy outside. Beautiful pictures from inside. The 18x zoom is what I was looking for in a point and shoot and this takes nice pics fully zoomed out. It has good night settings and very good stabilization. I have not tried the video recording yet. I didn't buy it for that, since I have a Panasonic DV camera for that. It has all the manual seetings that you would need to go beyond point and shoot. So for anyone who wants a point and shoot that is just a notch below or maybe even on the same level as some D-SLR's, this one is a very good deal at such an excellent price.

Bartmess \"TechUser\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ93YR17DXPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had three digital cameras, a Kodak back in 1996, an Olympus after that and this Panasonic.  This camera gives me everything I wanted.The camera housing is very sturdy. I take the camera everywhere and don't fear a little bumping around.  I take it hiking in teh mountains, casual walks, kayaking, kids soccer games.  performs like a champ.The pictures are great, the software works great, the LCD display on the back is almost as large as the device can hold, so only an extendable display would make it theoretically bigger. (Wouldn't that be a nice feature choice?)The camera comes on very quickly.  I feel spoiled by how quickly i can grab the camera, turn it on and shoot.  My Olympus was so slow to turn on and be ready.  You loose shots with a digital sometimes, the digital camera's biggest drawback.  But this DMC-FZ50 camera turns on in second.  The Olympus C-3030 zoom (recognizing it was last generation technology) also had a delay between pushing the shutter button and the camera collecting the image.  So it was virtually impossible to take picture of a child swinging or coming down a slide; you just didn't get the picture at the moment you wanted.  The data capture time to the focal plane array on this model has vastly improved.The thing has too many features to even talk about.  They all work.  i personally use very few of them.  The video capture is another feature that is vastly improved over what I experienced with my last digital camera, the Olympus.  It is a bit tricky on lighting with video but the sound that comes with the video is good and you can figure out how to get the lighting right if you mess around a little.  Anyway, if you want good video, capture it with a device made for that purpose.I bought two batteries and keep them both charged in my case when I'm going anywhere i expect to take a lot of pictures.  I haven;t timed the camera but I can't remember running out of battery power and have taken hundreds of photos on a vacation outing.I put an 8MB memory card in it, since memory is so cheap these days and I rarely even think about taking a second card with me.  If you're taking more pictures than this camera will hold on an 8GB card, you are missing the experience of the day with your face planted solely behind the camera.  Anyway, i haven;t counted the number of pictures I can take max but its a boatload.  Nobody who lived in the era of film cameras will ever complain about the number of photos you can take without loading another memory card.I think the camera's weigh feel good, the hand grip is substantial enough to make it easy to manage one-handed.One thing I don't like is how the sun shield attaches to the lense housing.  it seems to have been designed as an afterthought and doesn't fit well.  it always seems loose even if you tighten the thumbscrew used to hold it in place to its max tightness.I read some complaints about the lense cover before I purchased the DMC-FZ50 but I've had no problem with it.  It's leased and seems to stay in place alright.The displays can be a bit much to learn but that's simply because there are so many features.In regular sunlight the camera takes very stable pictures at full magnification.  The 18X zoom is awesome and having the ability to extend that electronically to 72X zoom withotu any additional lense is simple astounding.  However, don't expect crystal clear pictures at 72X extended zoom.All in all an excellent camera and for the price a real value.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best 18X Optical Zoom Camera !!", "Author": "Julio C.

You also get a large number of pictures on one battery charge even if you constantly use the LCD.  The only cons I've found are that they have problems indoors with low artificial light.  If you don't watch what you are doing you end up with a lot of yellowed images.  I often have to adjust the white balance and iso settings.

The hood accessory included in the box is a nice addition.It would have been nice to be able to zoom in and out when using the video.  But one just has to predetermine the best focal length before pressing record.  It would also be nice to have some indicator of focal length in mm when using the zoom.  It gives an indication in 2X or 10X and so on.  That means you just have to do a quick mental calculation to get an equivalent 35mm focal length.  I noticed it has no macro mode on the dial.  Most cameras do so I would say its not a good thing.The toggle or joystick can be very useful once you get used to it.  The shutter lag time is almost unnoticable.  The 8.1 MP is for the 4:3 ratio mode.  When you shoot at 16:9 ratio or the 3:2 (SLR) ration, the MP count drops to 6 and 7 MP.

Get it. Stay away from unknown sellers who are not know for easy returns!First, who shouldn't get it? If you are a pixel peeper (like me) *and* you are also going to feel small because there's noise on the dime sized parts of your subject. No one will even notice; unless you have a poster made and/or when compared to a Nikon ($2500) D300 or Canon 40D and at 800 ISO in low light and with no-flash allowed and fast movement. Then this may not be the right camera for you. Neither then, would any point and shooter. See DSLRs and get out your wallet.So soccer mom's WITH dim(Sun is OK) and zero flash restrictions might want to pass. Plus, (no-flash) dinner party snappers might look elsewhere, as well. You don't need the long zoom (Focal Length) around the dinner table. But don't think you will fair much better with a point and shooter, unless you spend MORE than the FZ18 costs, and find yourself a Fuji F31FD (or F30). The F40 isn't as good (low light) but you might like it with SD cards. No! These are still not better than just about any DSLR for low light, but they are pocket-able. These Fuji's also require some tweaking for the bright sun (they are so good at low light) so be prepared. These little compacts (if you can find one of the overpriced things) also do not have many of the niceties that one may enjoy with the FZ18. Such as a better motor; menu, etc. They use the dreaded xD.So, since we're being pessimistic, what would you miss if you got a DSLR instead (get both if you please.) Well besides Two to Fourteen times more cash, you'd lose movie mode and at 16:9 through the extremely high quality Leica (Say \"Like-ah\". You're welcome) lens system (Combined 28mm to 803mm equivalent). Do you know how much a DSLR lens, that does 70-300 (400mm equiv) at F4 (on the long end) costs; by it's self? You can do 504mm at about F4 (with adequate light.) 803mm if you have a large, view filling subject and use 3M (Mega pixel) Extended Zoom (EZ).Then there's weight. A lot more with DSLR's. More size too. bigger bag.Do you like a live view? The new live view DSLRs do not work the same.Would you like zero dust entering your camera?So, you can't take picture in the near dark (well, there is High Sensitivity mode but it's a pixelated toy. You can get a bright shot; in the extreme dim though.) Yet a DSLR camera can not go from really wide 28mm(with little distortion) and also up to 803mm zoom (with also little artifacts and the purple fringing eliminated) in an instant, without a pile of cash and someone to help you carry (and switch) the lens and a DSLR can't do all this in 848x480 (16:9) movie mode, given pausing between zooms.Yet, if someone would like to send me a free DSLR, I will suffer. :P Meanwhile, I'm running out of excuses to get anything more expensive than my FZ18.I have to agree. It seems to me, DSLR cameras are a racket. An expensive one. Please demand lower cost. Just think about what would happen to the DSLR market; if a camera like the FZ18 had a little sensor with the abilities of the Fuji F30 compact. Maybe it's time to stop saying \"mine is longer and bigger\". Keep your wallet in your pants until things improve. That will get some attention. What would be out of place, to have a \"pro\" camera, like the FZ18?Nothing is perfect but the FZ18 gets overall the closest.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buena relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio", "Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "R3DRP9E1S73GSI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hablar\u00e9 primero de la parte externa de la c\u00e1mara.

El flash responde muy bien a las configuraciones de exposici\u00f3n aunque no se porque Panasonic no incluyo una zapata para flashes externo.Calidad de imagen, como ya sabemos el tema del ruido sigue presente, en esta c\u00e1mara a partir de los 400 ISO es verdaderamente molesto para los mas exigentes aunque algunas personas ni lo notan, ISO mas altos son imposible de utilizar debido al excesivo ruido. Tiene capacidad de guardar las fotos en RAW que para muchos es muy importante.  Algo que si cabe destacar es la estabilizaci\u00f3n de imagen de la lente Leica, realmente funciona bien con el zoom al m\u00e1ximo. El auto foco es preciso y cuenta con el enfoque manual para ayudar en situaciones en las que no puede enfocar.En general, buen\u00edsima c\u00e1mara y esta acorde al precio.Por favor, no olviden que es una compacta de gama alta, controles manuales, algunos que otros ajustes, buena \u00f3ptica y otras prestaciones.

It seems to me it's sort of hard to take good pictures inside (low-light conditions) in the intelligent auto mode. I read reviews saying good things about the IAM mode. But in my case it gives me noisy pictures. We took pictures without flash inside (lights inside were on) and the skin color in people look way red and it's like the same red from skin covered places like shirt sleeves and such.I have also found out, the zoom is great and it clearly controls the jittering when you are zooming a lot. But other than that, I dont seem to find a setting I can use for when I need to take a good picture (good quality) and I dont have much time to think which setting or scene mode to use. The quality when putting the pictures in my computer doesnt seem to be the best, even the picture size is set to 8M.  If you zoom in to the picture in the computer, the pixelation is a lot.Do you have any comments on this? do you agree? I need some feedback.I want to know if this are drawbacks of the camera, or if I am just not suitable for a camera this complicated.
