I have a toddler and a tech-retarded wife, both of whom are responsible for previous spectacular digicam annihilations.  So I turned to the Stylus 790 more out of desperation than anything.Now I admit to being a total convert.  For the price-point, I was just hoping for something that took mediocre pics and wouldn't die in 6 months at the hands of my ruthless gadget assassins.  It, in fact, takes remarkable pictures, comes with a ton of handy features barely noted on Amazon, and really is indestructible.Really.  And by indestructible I mean it has survived being burried at the beach, dropped in the bubble bath, thrown in the toilet (more than once), gone through the dishwasher cycle (don't ask), dropped from our 3-level balcony to the sidewalk below, and having been laundered (washer AND dryer).Plus battery is good for hundreds of shots, the video clips are surprisingly crisp, and I rarely have issues with blurry pictures any more.  Also, Olympus' face-finding technology is pretty amazing stuff.Overall I would highly recommend this camera on its own merits as a great camera.  The fact the it survived my household is the icing on the cake, since (I hope) you won't be nearly as rough in testing it.

In particular I needed a camera that had image stabilization and be somewhat weather proof as I use it to take one-handed shots from a moving vehicle. While I am not a photo journalist, I do take a lot of photos for a motorcycle publication and needed something that I could use in less than ideal circumstances.Unfortunately my last camera had no image stabilization, so about 1/3 to 1/2 of all the photos I took came out blurred. But before I could make a decision on a replacement, my old one died. Apparently some road grit had gotten into the lens and one day it refused to extend or retract. Since most of the compact digital cameras on the market have lenses that extend prior to use, it narrowed the field down dramatically. This was the main reason I decided to go with the Olympus.I've had it for a few months now and had occasion to use it for both moving and normal photography (I've posted a few good and bad photos here). I'm not completely sold on it, but to me the pros outweigh the cons so I'm going to keep it. There are however, a few design issues that I find frustrating.The first is the focus time (the time between pushing the shutter button and when the photo is actually taken). With my old compact digital it was almost instantaneous, so \"I got what I shot\". With the Olympus it takes a second or two, which when shooting moving vehicles (from a moving vehicle) is enough time to allow the subject to change position and now be slightly out of focus. Unfortunately image stabilization will not compensate for that.Another issue is the placement of the flash. On most cameras the flash is on the opposite side from where you hold it (the flash is usually on the left while you hold it on the right). However, on the 790SW the flash is on the same side as the hand grip, which means that if you are not extremely careful your finger will block part of the flash. I have some group photos taken at night where the people on the right side are in darkness while those on the left and in the center are properly lit.But the biggest issue I have is with the battery life. Typically I would get between 300-400 shots from the battery on my old compact digital camera. However, the battery life on the 790SW is amazingly short. My first trip I got only 170 daylight shots before the camera completely shut down. As it was only mid morning and I wouldn't be able to charge the battery until that night, I spent the rest of the day with a useless camera while dozens of great photos got away. Since then I picked up a second battery, but still have to keep an eye on my power consumption so that I don't run out before the end of the day. I thought about buying a third or forth battery, but at that point I would be spending a large chunk of the overall cost of camera just to keep it powered.In short:Pros:Bulletproof (water/dust/freeze/crush/shock proof)Non extending lens will not jam from dirt or dustAuto open/shut metal lens coverImage Stabilization7.1 MegapixelCons:Focus timePlacement of the flashBattery lifeMust remove the battery to charge itWhile the focus lag-time problem might be unique to my work, the flash and battery issues are ones that everyone should consider before buying this camera. If you have unique needs (camera robustness, weather/water proof) then this is one of the few choices on the market and worth the money. However, if you don't need the special abilities this camera has to offer, I think you would be better served looking for something else in this (or even a lower) price range.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Performance in a small package", "Author": "Rebecca and Brian \"R. & B.

SOOOOO much easier than my first digital camera circa 1994 (yes, you read me right)....AND WORKS SEAMLESSLY WITH VISTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Nice editing tools within the software, thus no need to import pics into Photoshop or the like to correct red eye, etc. You can even email right out of the software v. attaching pics of old camera softwares gone-by.  Camera boasts the ability to shoot video as well (although I'd recommend the 2GB card, which likewise allows for tons of still images should you be away on vacation and unable to download/free up space).  Case colors are eye catching too.  All in all, considering the rough-in-tough capabilities (without the tank look of many electronics that are made for active and or clumsy users), the requisite/acceptable number of mega pixels (note I did not say stellar, just acceptable), the software (both in and out of the camera) and the large viewing screen (considering the overall size of the camera to begin with), this was a good buy for our family's needs.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Tonka Tough digital camera...", "Author": "Auliya \"An Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1YFG7Y5XII7SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ProsHe's a tough little guy, he's not going to break if you bump him or spill on himHe's an attractive cameraHe's small enough to go with you anywhereHe's easy to hold and handle, he comes with a safety strap tooHe's easy to use, no steep learning curve, just point and shootHe's plug-n-play style with Windows XP, no software install requiredConsHis battery doesn't recharge unless you pop it physically out of the camera and pop it into a separate charging trayAdditional ThoughtsIt's a good-looking, tough, small camera -- perhaps more bulky than the pictures you see on the web reveal, but still small and comfortable in the hand.

I used to own a Canon SD600 which was great for what we needed. But just like my 2 Canons before that, it stopped working within a year of purchase. Everyone had told me that Canon was the best but after 3 strikes I was sick of paying the money. And when I sent the Camera back to Canon for repair (under warranty mind you) they told me it would cost $107 to fix because I dropped it. I have never dropped that camera, EVER. Then they had the nerve to offer me the AD900 at a discounted price. This camera has a Titanium shell and got super poor reviews for being fragile, of all things. I'm done with Canon. After a few weeks of research, I settled on this camera.The Olympus 790SW is awesome. Great pics, awesome built in features. We make calendars right on the camera and send them out as post cards every month. It's water proof and we've taken underwater pics in the pool with it. It's light so it feels cheap but clearly is not. The video is only 25 seconds at high resolution but on the 2nd to highest setting it'll go on forever. We haven't been able to test the image stabilization because the camera just refuses to take a picture out of focus or blurred. I haven;t experienced any of the artifacts at high resolution that others have complained about. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a point and shoot. It truly is the only point and shoot I have ever encountered (more so than the Canon(s) I have had). Don't be scared off by the orange color. There are others available but the orange color looks distinct and cool. The Sound quality is great too and the flash is bright.  Still not convinced? Go to your local Best Buy or Circuit City. Even best buy told me that if you don't want a Canon, this is the best Camera to get and the toughest. Plus, you can play with it there too. Again, don't let it's weight throw you off (it's very light). Check it out at any decent electronics store but buy it at Amazon to get the best price.Hope you get one.

I really like the \"guide\" setting that helps you pick zoom effects, exposure effects, color effects, etc. The only drawback to this camera (like most other point and shoot cameras we've tried) is the lag time between pressing the button, and the time it takes to record the shot.

Nadda", "ReviewID": "R3ON5QS49WTTG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I needed something I could take to the beach and outdoors and not worry about it getting wet or some sand on it.  I will probably never take it underwater or dunk it.  I am worried that many people seem to have had flooding problems with this camera even though the manufacturer guarantees it and is specific about checking the seals and gaskets.  However, it is not worth a guarantee of a manufacturer repair when your vacation and pictures just got ruined.  So I'll stick to the above water waterproof claim.As far as pictures, it takes good pictures but not the best.  My Panasonic cameras and my Canon are far better.  The camera features are easy to learn and use, although I didn't like the owner's manual.  Even so, the features and menu options are sometimes cumbersome or not laid out logically.  I also am a little annoyed with the digital zoom settings.  I bought this camera because it claimed a 15x digital zoom and I need that.  However, this digital zoom is the type where you have to reduce the megapixel setting to about 3MP and then it enlarges the center of the picture while degrading the quality.  There is a smart zoom seting but that only gets you about a 10x magnification or less it seems.  So, if you need long zoom in a compact, this one is not it.  However there are not any waterproof cameras that offer that either.  Since I will have another zoom camera with me, i will not deduct too many points for this feature.  Face recognition works well.  Other special features seem to be good but somewhat cumbersome...Most of the time i don't have the luxury to fiddle with settings and features when my 3 year old is running around and I am trying to get a picture.  Startup time is fast, shot to shot is OK, focus time is pretty good.The video feature is decent, but again, not as good as other brands like SONY or PANA.  You have to make sure the camera is focused before you start video, otherwise it gets blurry for the whole movie...annoying.  The zoom doesn't seem to work well in video mode either.  Otherwise, the quality is ok and there are 2 different quality settings 30fps or 10 fps.Conclusion:  For waterproof cameras in this category and price, this one is great deal. It's good quality, portable, fast, feature loaded and stylish. This is why I git it 4 stars. I don't like the Xd Card system, so be ready to invest if your new to Olympus.  If waterproof, shockproof and freezeproof means nothing to you, then spend your money on a Canon, SONY or PANASONIC and you'll be much better off.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Everything I Wanted", "Author": "V.

In the past, I have always favored the traditional SLR type camera with the big lens on the front and the peek through a hole viewfinder. I even bought a digital version of said SLR when they first came out. I thought all the guys running around looking at mini TV's on the back of match boxes were crazy, or at least not very good photographers. Well, I've changed my mind.A few weeks ago I decided to go visit my brother in Seattle (I live in North Carolina)and I didn't want to carry my big camera. My birthday was coming, so I dropped some hints (Gee, that Olympus Stylus 790SW seems like a nice little camera) of the vague type. My older daughter bit and bought me one in a kit. I took it to the West Coast, used it at the Boeing Museum and the Seattle Art Museum as well as on a ferry at night. I was sold. This camera has adjustments for everything from fireworks to underwater - yes, underwater - closeups. You can shoot fast action almost as fast as film and the pictures turnout. Night shots look great. It has a \"face finder\" feature to help the photographer and it was easy to figure out. I'm 65 and us old dogs don't do well with new trcks, but this was an easy study.One little \"negative\" comment: If you are an extreme telephoto nut, this is not your camera. It only goes to 3x, but for the money, it isn't that bad.I'd buy one as a gift for someone I loved.Olympus Stylus 790SW 7.1MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Dual Image Stabilized 3x Optical Zoom (Black)", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "All-terrain camera suits my lifestyle", "Author": "Lilredrasta", "ReviewID": "R2BFWYHMWWX9CN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a tough, waterproof camera for work and play.  I have previously carried around a point-and-shoot in a zip-lock bag which was marginally effective and a big pain to deploy.  I love the sub-compact, shirt-pocket size of the 790SW and all of the capabilities in terms of water/dust/shockproofing.  I replaced the wrist strap with a breakaway neck lanyard (Catstrap made by EK Accessories) and that's how I usually carry it when I am wading with my fly rod, up to my waist in muddy water in a duck blind or paddling my kayak.  I love the internal zoom--the camera fires up instantly--I hit the \"on\" button and by the time I have a picture framed it is ready, flash is charged, etc.  7.1 resolution is more than sufficient for my use.  Would love to have a bit more zoom but 3X seems to be pretty standard so I can live with it.  Only other issue is the memory card--would prefer the use of an SD instead of the proprietary XD (the XD does not fit some card readers) but otherwise, the camera has thus far exceeded my expectations and the Amazon price even beat most listings on Ebay.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent, versatile P&S; Camera that can go underwater!", "Author": "E. Su \"drerwinsu\"", "ReviewID": "R1BWTJ3YV95DDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost bought an Olympus 770 earlier this summer.  At first glance the 790 seems to be a step backwards because it is only rated to 3m depth while the 770 is rated to 10m.  However, further inspection shows why the 790 has distinctive merits that make it a winner.Let's face it, 95% of most of the shots that we'll take with a camera will be on terra firma.  Therefore a camera should be as versatile and have the conveniences of the latest point and shoot models.  It should be small and thin with a decent sized LCD display.  The 790 offers these features with the added bonus of being waterproof.The 790 fires up quickly and takes pictures quickly.  You can find the exact times from other review sites.  It also offers face recognition autofocus ability.  I was looking for this feature because many of the shots that we typically take are portraits, etc. to remember vacations, trips, etc.  The 790 also offers an impressive array of settings that cover many, many different types of photographs.  The menus are easy and intuitive to use.  It also offers decent movie capability.The added bonus of being totally submersible makes the 790 an excellent point and shoot camera.  I used the camera on a recent Disney cruise through the Eastern Caribbean and the 790 worked very well in all aspects of the trip.  I could use it for typical touristy shots and then plunge it in the surf while playing with the kids.  Images taken during a snorkeling trip were rather nice.  The water was a little turbulent but the 790 still took decent pics.  In the pool with clearer water the pictures were very clear.  It was nice not having to worry about water, sand or hard knocks with this camera.  I have used underwater cases for other digital and film cameras.  There is a great advantage not having to use a case because you can see the screen much easier on the 790.  The screen on a camera inside a case is almost impossible to see underwater when you are wearing a dive mask.As stated before the 770 is rated to 10m depth.  But as a hobbyist snorkeler I rarely go deeper than the 3 m that the 790 is rated.  Other reviewers have stated that they have taken the 790 to deeper depths.  I have a trip to Maui coming up in March (poor me) and will possibly take the 790 to a little deeper depths.The waterproof capability of the 790 also can lead to some amusing pranks.  I had told my middle daughter about this feature but did not tell my oldest daughter.  I had my middle daughter take a picture in the surf of my oldest daughter and myself and she took a \"fall\" and dropped the camera into the water.  Needless to say I was \"upset\" and she was \"mortified\" that she dropped it.  The oldest daughter freaked out until we told her.  We had a good laugh.  When we go to Maui we will do the same thing to some friends when we go to the pool.", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Olympus 790", "Author": "Mitch Silver", "ReviewID": "R35K5G16BN3Y1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

It has/had potiential.", "Author": "TechPhile", "ReviewID": "R1727OOO4MN3IU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera upon its release in 2007 and now after almost a year, I have some opinions. I'll try to keep it simple.XD card format: Going the way of the dinosaur. Finding decent priced cards is hard. Also, the XD format tops out at 2gb. Unaaceptable. This in itself is a deal breaker. I think any new camera purchase from 2008 on should be SD/SDHC compatible as it is seemingly the industry standard as well as the only mini/micro class card media to go up to 16gb.Video recording Limitations: Another deal breaker. The VGA resolution of recording has a 10 sec limit. There is a firmware update that allows unlimited (card limit) recording but Olympus only released it for the 1030sw and 850sw. Even then, the limit is 4gb but that is not even a factor as the 790 has no update available. The only plus in video recording is the AVI format. I appreciate this as I work mainly with AVI's with my Pocket PC's and Creative Zen Vision M Media player.Low light captures: Indoor photos with low ambient are very poor. I have tried many different settings and even adjusted WB & ISO but to no avail. the flash either washes out the focal point or over compensates if using the shadow adjust \"feature\".Delay time in capturing images: If using the scene modes setting in the wheel selector, every time you turn on the camera you have to manually select a scene. You cant take a picture unless you manually chose a scene. So time from power up to scene select to auto focus to capture can range up to 5 sec if using scene select. When using image stabilization, the capture time is also delayed. noticibaly much that I have missed many special moments when my son (2yo) was smiling doing something cute. Even a shutter button hard press (bypassing the half press autofocus) did not actually bypass anything. It was still delayed.Size: It is in the compact catagory competing with most sony dsc & T models and the Lumix line. Although for a water resistant it is the smallest that I know of beside the canons.Outdoor shots: This is where the camera has its best captures. Greens and blues are true and auto focus seems fast when well lit and using the correct ISO/Scene select. Assuming that the person who wants a all-weather camera is active and needs a camera that can capture an image quickly, this camera should suffice for that situation.Durability/H20 resisance: I have not tried this under water. It did get a little rain on it and no problems there. I had dropped the camera from about 4 ft to tile floor. It survived. I did the same drop by accident on my old Sony T-20 and it seperated into 2 pieces.Favorites setting: This is where the manual is wrong. I dont care what it says, you cannot retrieve a photo once it is marked as favorite. The manual will say that you can move a photo back but I tried with no avail. In other words, unless you only plan to have a photo sit in hte cameras memory and not print, copy or transfer to your computer then great. If you have not copied it to your computer or printed it before you mark it as a favorite you are out of luck with that and will only be able to view it on the LCD or in a slideshow on TV via AV cable. Once marked as a favorite, it is gone from the XDcard and embedded in the cameras memory with no way to transfer it off or back to the card. Ridiculous. That's no way to treat a favorite anything right?I really wanted to like this camera due to the 7mp, weather resistance, \"video recording\", size and the fact that I spent about $350 with the extra batteries and silicone case. But I will be selling this camera due to the above issues and cannot recommend it with good conscience to anyone. Unless you can get this camera for under $150 and plan to use it as a outdoor/beach only camera then go for it. It should meet and exceed your expectations. Another situation where the 790sw would be ok in, is if it's for a child, like a young child. This camera may be good for them as it should withstand most minor bumps a kid would throw at it... and the occasional drop in the toilet at summer camp.BTW, the firmware update that was offered to the other Olympus cameras allows you to use one of their XD card adapters to use a micro SD. So you will need to buy another item. Yet another issue is thta this SD to XD adapter is not available for sale, it comes packaged with the new Olympus cameras but for the 790 people we are out of luck. So basically we need the Firmware 1.1 release AND the adapter release. I have emailed Olympus support requesting the Firmware 1.1 update for the 790sw. I highly doubt that they will oblige but if they do I will happily edit this review.

I have the lime version and we've been almost everywhere together since December 2007.  Just last week, I took it with me to a rock concert and got some great photos (more on that a little later).  Even though I'm not much of a drinker since leaving college, I still refer to this as my \"drunk proof\" camera, because I think it would be absolutely perfect for a bar-hopping college student... you don't have to worry too much about getting it wet or dropping it.  I don't worry about it when I leave it out in my truck in freezing temperatures.  I've had it out taking pictures when it's really dusty and the wind is blowing dirt around, etc and I just don't worry about it at all.The one time I did worry was when we were in Maui last May (2009) and my wife (who bought it for me in 2007) wanted to take it with us snorkeling.  Well, what the heck right?  The first time we took it out, it performed beautifully in the shallow water... no problems at all!  Later that day, however, we tried using it in the hotel swimming pool.  No problems with the few pictures we took, but soon after that, the camera ceased working.  I don't know if it had something to do with the chlorine in the pool or what.  No worries - aloha spirit and all that, so I just left it open, took out the battery and card and let it all dry out.  It wasn't soaked or anything, but I had the feeling there was some moisture inside.  This was unfortunate because while I had my Canon PowerShot with me, I wasn't about to take that down by the water and the cheapo disposable camera we bought on the beach for body boarding pictures ended up getting ruined before we could develop them.  A day or two later, the battery still wouldn't work... the light on the charger would just flash like I was crazy for trying.  Well, I was a boyscout back in the day, so I had a brand new extra battery with me.  After charging that battery (and again, the camera had sat with the door open for a day or two to dry out completely), everything worked just fine... the XD card was fine - just the battery went bad.  I've been using the camera ever since.  Would I be worried to take it in an ocean or lake with me again?  Yes, I would.  Honestly, I'd probably just buy a high-quality disposable camera.  I can tell you that I would NOT take it in a swimming pool again, that's for sure!Now that the water issue is out of the way, I wanted to address photo quality.  Have I got some grainy pictures with this camera?  Yes, I have.  Did I try to change the setting to get better pictures?  You bet!  I feel that you definitely sacrifice a little bit of photo quality with this camera in exchange for some very cool features.  However, if you're willing to play with it a little bit and learn some of the settings, you can usually get it figured out and take some really good pictures.  For instance, it's very easy and fast to turn the flash on and off (just push right on the control pad) or push the flower button on the left side if you're shooting stuff super close.  The top button on the control pad for exposure is awesome... it will show you 4 different possibilities at a time, then press left to see darker settings or right to make it brighter... that's a BIG help and is super fast and easy to do!  Also, when I was taking pictures at the concert last week for instance, it was low light (at times) and I was not about to use a flash, so I turned the knob to the little shaky hand (between the SCN and the picture of the camera (auto setting)) and it did great!  The local newspaper even put some of the pictures I took on their website!  Of course you can also play around with the knob on the SCN setting... Sport is another favorite setting of mine when I'm trying to take pictures of moving people/objects.  Available Light is another one I use fairly often.  WHEN SHOOTING OUTDOORS (especially in bright sun), turn the knob to GUIDE and press down twice (3 - Shooting into backlight), then press OK (1 - Activate Shadow Adj.) and that helps TREMENDOUSLY!  Without that setting, I would be in trouble.  I use it almost 100% of the time when I'm outside and the sun is out (sometimes even when it's cloudy and kinda bright).  On a side note, the the movie mode works just find and is an additional nice feature this camera offers (I believe it shoots in WAV or some type of Microsoft compatible format - it's not the QuickTime kind).  I hope that helps a little bit!In short, this camera is not perfect, but it's still pretty awesome.  You don't need to bother buying a case for this camera!  The battery seems to last forever, which is I take for granted sometimes.  I do try to charge it up before going out if I know I'm going to be using it a lot (note: it does take a few hours to charge completely).  My 2 GB XD card is almost full right now and there are 1800 high-resolution pictures AND some long videos on there!  The main reason I can't give this camera 5 stars is because, unfortunately, I would agree that it is questionable under water.  Others might not give it 5 stars because of picture quality.  It might not take the very best pictures, but I have taken a LOT of really good ones!  I will admit that there was a lady next to me at the concert last week with a Canon PowerShot SD940IS (the red one) and she was taking, for the most part, a lot more quality pictures than I was.  However, if your buddy spilled some beer on that camera at the bar or if you got bumped and dropped it or if it fell out of your pocket in the car and you left it out in the cold or if you took pictures in the pouring rain or maybe a dust storm... would the Canon hold up like this Olympus Stylus?  I doubt it!  This Olympus is one TOUGH camera!  Take it for what it is.  I might buy a Canon for a little bit better quality pictures, but this Olympus will always be my go-to tough guy back-up if nothing else.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy a year after", "Author": "GX", "ReviewID": "R30CZL81BCNWS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had this camera for a little more than a year and can't say how happy I am with its durability.

We've tried our other digital camera, a Fuju that we have loved, and our small digital video camera. Both freeze. And when I say freeze, I mean after only moments in the air on a mountain at 32 degrees... or even higher ... they freeze, even after carrying them in an inner pocket to keep them warm. SO, I was hunting for a camera specifically for outdoor photography in the winter on the slopes.The Olympus Stylus 790SW is almost perfect for the job. First, when outfitted with an in-specification memory card and a fully charged battery, it works great in the cold! We demonstrated this many times this past winter, on mountains that were cold... 20 degrees at noon cold. Second, while we hadn't specifically been looking for it, the camera is shock-resistant. The specs say it will resist the shock of being dropped from a specific height. Well, we haven't dropped it. But we HAVE fallen while its in that inner pocket. I don't believe either of us has fallen directly on the camera, but I certainly worry a great deal less than I have with our other cameras during our winter photography attempts. Finally, it is waterproof to a certain depth in a body of water. This is perfect for those days when the snow is getting under the coat, or even on those occasional rain bursts. No fear of trashing the camera.The only negative is the lack of a viewfinder. Only the large LCD provide feedback as to what the camera is pointing at. Indoors this is fine. Outdoors, in the bright with white snow reflecting light right at you, this makes it at times impossible to see any hint of what the camera is capturing. Add to this the effect of the polarized lense in most goggles, and its just plain hard to see the LCD while on the slopes. The good news in all of this is that I've taken many a blind photo only to find, when reviewing it that evening, that I got exactly what I was looking for... the only real challenge is holding the camera level.The bottom line: This is almost the perfect camera to take to the ski slopes, and it would be perfect with a viewfinder that allowed you to see what you are capturing even in the brightest light conditions.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For :)", "Author": "Serene L.

I also wanted something for snowboarding that could take snow, wind, and rain as well as take continuous shots of my buddies dropping cliffs or hitting jumps.

Luckily, for bursts and video, the claims that the H type card is 2-3 times faster are true (for my setup anyway).  I am able to take an UNLIMITED amount of continuous shots.  Additionally, I can capture about 30 min of standard quality video.  I'm a picky consumer, and kept my receipts in case I wanted to return it.

This camera was dropped off a ski lift into the snow below and still kept going (and the black color made it simple to find the thing!). It survived a dunk in the hot tub as well as a dusty campsite. All the while I could relax a little because I knew this camera was tough.I'm not a shutterbug and wont pretend to know if the color balance is good or if the noise levels are unacceptable, but I know I have plenty of great pics of my trip. Like any camera, not every picture comes out right, but I got to know the setting buttons and menus which I think are well laid out for quick adjustments on the fly, and this problem disappeared. The camera itself is quite sleek-looking and is thin enough for most pockets. Another plus is it seemed to have a quick startup time for unexpected action shots, as opposed to my old camera whose lens had to extend and withdraw each time, which became agonizing when a good shot passed you by.In summary, if you foresee abuse, accidents, and general mishaps happening to your camera (within reason, of course) this is the one for you.

I got it precisely because it is rugged and waterproof, and figured that was worth the extra money.  And it is - if you don't mind the TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY.The Casio excelled at taking pictures in low light.  If you turned off the flash and set it to anti-shake, it would warn you about low exposure, but it would still take the picture with quick shutter speed to minimize blurring.  It was perfect for concerts, campfires, candlelight, any time you didn't want a flash.This camera is USELESS in low light.  As soon as you turn of the flash, it slows the shutter speed waaaay down.  I have tried using the presets for \"candlelight,\" \"available light,\" and \"night scene,\" and they all slow  the shutter speed and recommend using a TRIPOD (yeah, sure, got one in my pocket).  You can't even MANUALLY speed up the shutter with the flash off.  It overrides your settings and you end up with blurry pictures.  Any time you're not in direct sunlight, or taking pictures with the camera's auto-flash, expect to take multiple pictures, cursing and fiddling with settings, and still ending up blurry.  It's terrible.Not only that, but it has a far shorter battery life than the Casio Exilim and seems to loose its charge even when not in use.Not only THAT, but it takes a weird proprietary XD memory card.

All the different functions are great, as long as you have a few seconds to flip through to the different functions.  If not, I would suggest only to use the anti-shake feature.  I missed some precious pictures of my nieces and nephews meeting for the first time because I wasn't able to flip through all the different scene functions in time.  Make sure to have an extra lion battery also otherwise you'll end up having to wait for it to be recharged before taking more pictures.  I have to charge mine every night.  Also the multiple pictures feature is great!  It takes many pictures rapidly as long as you hold down the button, but every few pictures turn out blurry.  I would suggest using the one speed slower if you use this function.  Other than these few difficulties, this is a great camera.

It just feels quite fragile but not in a bad way. Please don't get me wrong, its physical finish is quite a beauty that's why I can't seem to believe it's supposed to be as tough as it is.Shooting and features are acceptable on broad daylight but taking pictures during the night is quite below standard. I find the automatic shooting settings quite useless during the day or the night. With it being useless, you have to get used to a number of functions that come with the product so that you will get a good shot of a specific situation. This is quite annoying specially if you need to shoot something in a near instant.For now, I'm giving this product 3 stars since I haven't capitalized on its toughness and water resistant capabilities yet. If I'll be able to do so, this might get 4 stars from me.My recommendation would be to buy something else with its price range if you don't really need a tough camera. But if you don't like to go to service centers for camera problems and all that, then get this one.

I bought this camera hoping it was the solution to every problem I have ever had in my life.  The problem with this camera is that it falls out of my pocket seemingly everytime I move my leg...walking, sitting or laying down.  You would think olympus would consider this seeing as how much you have to spend on the camera.  the camera is waterproof for sure, I sat at an aqua bar for 6 hours with it in my pocket, however when i stood up to get out of the water, the camera fell out of my pocket.  I went on a tubing trip recently and at some point the camera fell out of my pocket.  I could not capture any moments with friends to remember what happened on the trip.  I may never buy an olympus camera again, and am seriously considering writing a mean spirited letter to the company.  This camera has let me down multiple times by its only design flaw...falling out of pockets.  I read the reviews before purchasing the camera and had an idea of the risk I would be taking by purchasing a camera that could fall out of my pocket, but I put faith in olympus because they are the best camera maker.
