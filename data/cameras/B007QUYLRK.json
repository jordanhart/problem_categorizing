Also del was 4 days early!  Thanx FocusThis is an update about the rest of the package deal from FocusThe tripod was insufficient to say the least It could not hold the camera weight, along with the camera bag which wasnt even a \"camera\" bag but one for a small camcorder.I sent both back paid over $15 for shipping and filed with Amazon about my problemthey (FOCUS) sent me another \"bag which again is not big enough for the sony A77V that I ordered and even though they sent me back a Zeiko full size tripod valued by Focus at $9.95 (REALLY?), I still feel it will not be sufficient to handle the size and weight of the camera I boughtAlso in communication with Focus, The missing remote control from my first delivery, I was told was ready to ship and as of this date still no remote!I am not going to send back the bag and tripod this time because shipping for the 2nd time will amount to over $30 for the two timesBUT I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN FOCUS FOR THE WAY THEY FOLLOWED UP ON THIS PROBLEM!I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLAT THIS POINT I CHOSE TO CHANGE MY RATING OF THIS SELLER", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Malissa Garcia", "ReviewID": "R2PVR6SVO0AS7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love love love this camera.

I purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens for daily use and a large back pack (the one that comes with the bundle is definitely too small therefore I will use it with my point and shoot camera only).  This camera takes amazing photos!!!", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Nice DSLR", "Author": "Tammie Taylor", "ReviewID": "R29QCKZLSBFTWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the performance of this camera, clear shots, easy to use if you are somewhat familiar with a DSLR. Has many options for your personal style of photography. The only draw back I see is that when you go to adjust the diopter for your vision sometimes you hit the record button that is beside of it which can be a little frustrating.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Eddy", "ReviewID": "R39S1F84L1BY8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera w/ alot of accessories..very good bundled deal..bag is a little small but I didnt intend on using it for the a77 anyway", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal!", "Author": "Victor Peralta", "ReviewID": "RP5E8CPM19BDT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this kit and everything arrived on time and in perfect conditions.

Upon arrival, I noticed that the camera and lens were NOT factory sealed and appeared to have been previously opened. All other items in this package were brand new with the seals still intact. I've purchased sony alpha cameras before and am familiar with the way they are sealed and this one clearly had been unboxed for some reason earlier in its existence. Functionally: the camera  and lens are flawless, I was able to shoot excellent stills with little adjustment in no time. The tripod in my opinion is great for smaller cameras but not for the A77, being that it's a fairly large camera. My satisfaction is met but only due to the camera being in perfect physical and operating condition, I am however still a little unsettled with the two main items appearing to be for some reason factory unsealed.  The savings through this offer is substantial, that being said if your looking to get a lot of extras that are useful (nice lens, nice memory card, remote, extra battery and charger) spend the extra 100 bucks. If you just want to upgrade to the a77,  just buy the body alone.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007QUYLRK"}}
