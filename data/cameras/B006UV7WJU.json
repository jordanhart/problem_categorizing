{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vivitar 9112", "Author": "J. Lindner", "ReviewID": "R517A6BJJHCLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera this past weekend.  I was going to an event where my DSL camera would be awkward and I wanted something I could slide in my pocket.  I bought this since it offered good picture resolution, 9.1 megapixels, yet was under $50.  This camera got the job done for me.  I liked the crisp pictures and since there was a large crowd, I was able to hold the camera up over my head and point and shoot.  None of my pictures will ever grace Time or National Geographic magazines, but I was able to capture memories and isn't that why we buy cameras in the first place?If you want an inexpensive yet powerful little camera, I suggest you consider the Vivitar 9112.  There are other cameras out there, but you'll likely be as pleased as I was when I viewed my photos after my weekend event.  Beware, this camera, like others in its class, goes through batteries pretty fast.  Buy an econopac of AAA batteries before you hit the road.  But you will end up with a fine collection of photos for your efforts.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "loved it", "Author": "shelly", "ReviewID": "R1EK9V47IDILBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made very good use of this product. i even sent it to relatives abroad to let them see how good it is. i will soon purchase another.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera.", "Author": "Satisfied User", "ReviewID": "R31PVU1OVO93C5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My six year old grandson wanted a camera for Christmas.

I do not recommend it.  I take pictures daily - my husband bought this for me when I was in a pinch, I ended up buying a new camera in less than a week.

The price was fantastic, could not find a basic digital camera for less money,  Vivitar is good make.  Only thing was I had to buy batteries, and memory card, fairly inexpensive item and easy to use, once you view the CD that comes with and download into computer which takes almost 45 minutes to do so.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pice of Junk", "Author": "minu", "ReviewID": "R290ZDV1QC1WKU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very poor construction, lens is very cheap the batteries do not last at all, camera stoped working after 2 days", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be Better if the Software Disc worked", "Author": "Teriane38", "ReviewID": "R2AAVL3HZECE4O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad camera for what you pay for it. Little bit cheap feel to it, but the software disc that comes with it to install on your computer doesn't work. When you put it into your computer, you get a corrupted file error.
