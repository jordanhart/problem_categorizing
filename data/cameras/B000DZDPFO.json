This camera allows for zooming and has sound while taking video. I like that you have the option of cliping pictures out from the video clips. This allows for some humerous pictures. I really like this camera.I did have a problem with the zoom button 2 months after buying the camera and after about a month of not using the camera. I had to press the button really hard for it to zoom. I called Amazon to take back the product but they were not very helpful with informing me how much money they would refund me or how I can take it to HP if it were under warantee.All in all, the camera is very usable and I plan on keeping it and have not had any other problems with the camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Anthony L.

It is great, I don't know what most people be buying a 8 and 9 mp camera for, b/c if you are not blowing a picture up bigger than a 10 X 12, then you don't need nothing bigger than a 6 mp camera. I seriously like this camera. HP is doing a good job on Photosmarts. This camera takes great pictures and the zoom is incredible.

You can do panorama and stick them together.  Wonderful feature.

The only downside is that it is so small, i am used to camera that feels and weighs like a camera. (i think it is a little smaller than a deck of cards) so if you want small, this is the camera for you. or if you want a great camera and you can adjust to the compactness, purchase this camera!", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Meredith Browne", "ReviewID": "R1W5IWDOUFAG74", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I first purchased the HP Photosmart R725, I was very impressed.  It was a high quality camera and the price impressed me.  After less than a month, the camera no longer worked.  Whenever I turned it on, an error message popped up and then the camera turned back off.  I got on the HP website and they were very helpful and replaced my camera within a week and thus I was happy again, until this continued happening.  I am now on MY FIFTH HP R725, or maybe its the 6th?  I'm not sure I lost count.  The first problem happened the first few times.  I just got off of the HP website to report the fact that my camera takes pictures, but I can't see what of because the LCD remains a blank screen.  They refuse to allow me to talk to anyone who speaks decent English and will not refund my money or give me a different camera, I can only have the same one over and over again.  I actually got on Amazon so that I could attempt to sell the replacement camera that they are sending me and was surprised to find good reviews.  I don't do anything unusual with my camera nor do I use it too often, and I don't think that its possible that I have simply gotten so many \"lemons\".  I highly suggest that you do not buy this camera!", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera all around", "Author": "fred", "ReviewID": "R2LQNDBI0BJEOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really enjoy my Photosmart R725.  It's small, easy portable, takes wonderful photos, and is very versatile in terms of settings.  I just have one thing I don't like about it, and that's the fact that there is no viewfinder.  There is an LCD screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder, but it's hard to see in bright sunlight, and I'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use.  For now, it's great but I'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run.  At the same time, it's not spendy, so it might be worth it.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Luv it", "Author": "A.

It takes great pictures and videos-better than my Canon which cost much more(especially inside -like in auditoriums).  She especially enjoys all the fun features to enhance her pictures right in the camera, because she prefers to just keep them all in the camera and scroll through with her friends.  HOWEVER, after about four months, the LCD \"shattered\"-a big black spot with black and white lines radiating out in each direction.  Since no viewfinder, the camera was unusable, although it still took pictures just fine-you just couldn't see what you were doing-or look at them afterward.  HP replaced the camera-no charge.  Two months later, the same thing happened to the replacement.  We got that camera's replacement last week. It wouldn't read any memory cards-the newest one arrived today.  It seems to be working fine.  I will say that HP has been great about sending cameras without charging us, but what a pain. (of course, you must go through at least a half an hour on the phone with the tech who will tell you to take the card out, take the battery out....etc.)  BE VERY CAREFUL that nothing comes in contact with the screen-it needs better protection, I think.  We bought an extended warranty through the Amazon seller when we purchased, but who knows whether it even covers four cameras later....", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Would not recommend", "Author": "Tara M. Trent", "ReviewID": "R2DI3H0ZG78SZ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera for my birthday in March.  I exchanged it 2 days later because the battery would not hold a charge.  The second one lasted until about 2 weeks ago (so approx. 3 months).  This time the camera would turn itself on when it was just sitting on the counter and turn itself off when I tried to take a picture.  Very weird.  Anyway, I have been trying to return it to Target again, but every Target in my area seems to be out of them.  So I have decided that I am going to try something else.  I seem to have no luck with HP cameras, the last one I owned (before the R725) just decided to die on the day of my sons 3rd birthday party.  I believe the problem with the R725 does not lie with the camera itself, but with the battery.  It would be a great camera if the battery would be better.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "IT's HERE!", "Author": "M. A.

As I walked back to my dorm, I thought that perhaps there'd been a mistake; there was no way this light package could be it.  There's no way this could be the camera I'd just ordered last Wednesday.  It's probably the memory card.I opened the box and sure enough, it was the camera.  Made of steel and incredibly light and small, this camera is a major upgrade compared to what I used before it.  I dare say this camera is probably the last one I'll use (barring a disastrous drop) for a while.  It takes clear pictures, even though I have shaky hands.  I am going to recommend this camera to a friend that has never had a camera.As I become more accustomed to using the camera, I'll probably end up updating my review of it, and something tells me that it'll consist of primarily positive things.", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Better bring your charger!!!", "Author": "N.

Just be sure that if you plan on taking more than 10 pictures, have your charger ready to plug back into the wall. Then within minutes, it'll show that it is completely charged again, yet within taking only a few more pictures the red screen will show, \"Battery too Low to take Pictures\".

Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2BHEJLRM53VOG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a year now. I like HP products and figured this would be as great as most of their products. I was very disappointed though. I've had to return this camera to HP already because it kept giving me a red screen with an error message. They sent me a new camera for free and so far this one is doing decent.  Also, as far as clarity goes, it kinda sucks. I suppose if you have never used a good quality camera then you might be inclined to think this one isn't so bad. But believe me, there are better cameras out there for the money that you would spend on this one. If you can find this camera under $100 then I would say go for it but otherwise I don't reccomend it at all. I have had webcams that take better pictures.Also, if you are having issues with any HP product that you own, you can always call HP and tell them the problem and they will take the product back and send you a new one. I have to admit that HP has really good customer service. I also own an HP laptop and HP printer. I have had to return the printer to HP once and they sent me a new one a few days later for free.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera!", "Author": "Cryssa", "ReviewID": "RMED9JBNFBDYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually found this little camera in a box of stuff my mother bought in an auction. There was no battery with it and it was kind of beat up on one side so I had no clue if it would work. So I came on Amazon and bought the replacement battery with charger. The new battery arrived, I charged it, and slid it in the camera and lo and behold...it worked like a charm! The LCD screen was intact it wasnt broken like I feared it may have been, all the buttons and features worked...and goodness knows what this camera went through before I got it. I bought a spare backup battery from Amazon along with a 2GB memory card since the batteries arent even $10 each. This camera gets fantastic battery life and I think that is because the battery is kind of made for the camera. A fully charged battery will last me at least 3 days of regular use before I have to charge it or use my backup battery...much better than using rechargeable AA batteries...those things are a joke. I have another photosmart camera I got brand new that takes rechargable AA's, and they dont even last a day. So you can guess which camera I use more often right?

The hp will still be around holidays, movie premiere nights and the like. Not to mention the great little videos it can do.
