{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent all-around camera for point and shoot photography which also allows more serious usage as well.", "Author": "Kaichu Dento", "ReviewID": "R3F5YKHI6GIHNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been searching for a new camera to replace my Fujifilm F800 EXR that started having focusing problems and after having looked at a wide range of cameras, finally settled on this one.There were more than a few contenders that I almost purchased, but changed course on for one reason or another.The various features I've been interested in include:*Very compact, enough so that I can wear it on my belt every day.*Wide ranging zoom (which is in conflict with the next one)*Ability to take pictures in compromised lighting, particularly in low lighting with movement or completely dark setting*Versatility in settings without having to jump through multiple screens to find the setting you're after*Easily usable manual settings*Capable of viewing older picture files taken on previous cameras (believe it or not, Sony and Canon have this function fully disabled)*User selected language (Sony and Panasonic Lumix do not offer English)*USB cable charging, negating the need to carry an actual charger, or remove the battery from the camera*Wide range of Scene settings*Full set of manual controls, including focusHere's a list of some of the cameras I looked at during my search, more than a couple of which I almost bought;Canon SX-280 HSFujifilm F900 EXRNikon S9500Olympus SH-50Panasonic DMC TZ-40Sony HX-50Sony WX-300The ones that really had me wanting to buy, but failed in one way or another were the Canon SX-280 and the Sony HX-50, but with the Exilim ZR-1100 in hand I feel very happy with my choice. I also came very close to going with the Panasonic DMC TZ-40.The ability to see all my older picture files was a very welcome surprise. The last several cameras I've had were able to view most of my older picture files, but this is the first one which allowed me to view all of them, in contrast to none viewable on the Canon and Sony models.Doing a picture search is one of the slowest and fastest operations however and while I'm still getting used to it, the ability to control picture viewing both with the front dial which can be commanded to search in jumps of 10, 25, 50, 100 or by date is a great feature with a couple of shortcomings.Notably, when doing a search by date, all dates are shown, as opposed to just ones that have picture files, and when doing jumps it would be nice if you could see the image immediately to either side of the central image until your choice is made.As well as the whole of this camera has been executed, I'd be surprised if the design team at Casio doesn't eventually zero in on these refinements.Just doing some picture taking in the normal P setting, it's incredible the amount of camera shake you can get away with on a long zoom setting. I took some experimental shots at the store of signs that I couldn't even read, only to have them turn into readable, non-blurred photographs. Their version of anti-shake technology has really advanced far beyond my first experience with it.I've since been able to take blurred photographs, particularly in lower light with fast movement, and at this point it's my job to take their accomplishments and get well enough acquainted that I know what I can get away with and what I can't.One reason I didn't notice this camera at first was that going from a 20x zoom, I wasn't interested in losing any zoom range, but dropping to the 12.5x zoom looks to be a compromise that brings enough positive features that I feel no regret in choosing this camera.An additional feature I never even considered was the flip up screen which will help a lot when taking extreme low angle shots, which I like to do, not to mention if you take self shots.There will be lots of reviews coming up on this great little camera very soon!", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$358.00", "Features": "Equipped with a 920,000-pixel high-resolution tilt-up display and built-in stand for shooting at various angles\nFitted with a function ring and control dial for intuitive and quick operation\nBrightening Mode makes skin appear smooth and clear\nMulti Frame SR Zoom maintains refined image quality with exceptional clarity to a maximum zoom of 25x\nJapanese model as same as Ex-zr1200we", "Name": "Casio Digital Camera Exilim Zr1100 Black Ex-zr1100bk", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lVmHhWGKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F29VJMM"}}
