{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great features and price", "Author": "Nylo", "ReviewID": "RDR7B8614H9ZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd digital camera, and it replaced my Olympus 4000, which was excellent, but I wanted more zoom, an electronic viewfinder, and longer shutter times. The 5100 has certainly delivered, with a couply of relatively small compromises. The Olympus 4000 menus and controls are a tough act to follow. However, it seems that Olympus and Fuji share some technology, icons, and ideas. The physical handling of the 5100 is excellent, with a very secure-feeling, molded grip for your right hand. I found all the control buttons well-placed and easy to manipulate. When you sort through all the cameras out there, looking for 10x optical zoom, extended grip, and the ability to use AA batteries, the list quickly narrows! I use sets of 2500 mAh nickel-metal AA batteries, and an inexpensive charger. Another great feature is the included lens tube adapter, lens cap, and cap-keeper. Just screw on a 55mm UV or skylight filter, and you can completely enclose and protect the lens assembly. At the fully wide position, you will see a small amount of vignetting (shadowing) at the corners if you have more than one filter screwed on. I found the electronic viewfinder to be more helpful than an optical viewfinder, and still visible outdoors in sunlight. You can also read and manipulate the settings without taking your eye from the viewfinder. I purchased a couple of 512 MB XD cards with the camera. You will really need the extra memory when you take movies. Movie mode, at a full 30 frames/sec, was surprisingly good, even if you can't change the zoom or focus once you start a movie. Startup, and writing pics and movies to the XD card is nice and fast. The self-timer includes an extra 2-second setting, which is useful for activating the shutter without shaking the camera, such as for long exposures or telephoto shots on a tripod. The adjustable white balance works quite well. The slickest way to make the most of this feature and to set exposures in manual, is to use a photographic gray card. The one I bought was 8x10 inches. I cut out a smaller rectangle, about 4x6 inches, that fits in my photo bag. One side is pure white, and the other is a special shade of gray. To set the white balance, place the card with the white side toward you, in the same light as the subject, zoom in on it, and activate the manual white balance function in the menu. This assures you of near perfect color no matter what the lighting is. The manual exposure mode of the camera allows you to set the shutter and aperture quickly, and there is an exposure meter in the display that shows you how your settings compare with the automatic metering. The slick way to set exposure is to use the gray side of the gray card, place it in the same light as the subject, zoom in on it, and set your shutter and aperture until the exposure meter is centered. Once, done, you can just concentrate on zooming and framing to compose your shots, as long as the lighting is the same. I tested the S5100 with a remote flash unit and a slave trigger adapter, which allow you to create professional, portrait-type lighting quite easily. Unlike my previous digital, the S5100's flash synch and metering seems to be compatible with this technique. You set your external flash to automatic, which is calibrated for a specific ISO film speed and aperture. It's easy to use the aperture priority mode in the S5100 to match these settings. Then using an inexpensive slave trigger device that clips onto the hot shoe of the external flash unit, you can place the external flash/trigger assembly on a mini tripod off to the side and up high, perhaps on a bookshelf, aimed at your subject. The S5100's pop-up flash illuminates the subject from the front, and the slave trigger fires the external flash at the same time, providing the main light from above and to the side. The power saving function of the S5100 worked just fine as set from the factory. It blanks the LCD/viewfinder after 2 minutes, to save power, and will shut the camera off if you don't press any buttons after that. A neat feature that is not apparent in the specifications is the ability to record a 30 second (or less) voice memo with each picture. You can record these any time after the pic is taken and stored on the card. When you play back a pic, you can hit a button to play back the corresponding voice memo, which is stored as a separate audio file. You can also hit another button to display all the technical exposure information for each pic, which is automatically stored in each pic file. So far, I have just a couple of complaints. When playing back pics or movies to a TV using the included video cable, I have yet to find a way to rotate images taken in portrait orientation. Turning your head sideways to watch is not very comfortable! If you know a way to do this, please post it here! As mentioned in other reviews, the manual focus mode doesn't have a distance meter to help you: you have to carefully study the display while adjusting to judge the best focus. This is particularly hard to do in low light.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Beginner To Advanced Camera", "Author": "TheMatrixFearsChoice", "ReviewID": "RZA4T2E4WE9MC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got the S5100 for christmas.  I work as a sports reporter and had been using an olympus stylus 3.2 megapixel camera to take photos to accompany my articles.  The stylus, while an excellent point and shoot camera for vacations and snapshots, just wasnt cutting it for professional looking pics.  The S5100 on the other hand, has been everything I was looking for in a surprisingly affordable price.The controls are fairly intuitive, I'm the kind of person who jumps right in with a gadget instead of pouring over the instruction manual first, and there were very few things that I couldn't figure out how to do just by working with the camera itself.The video and sound quality is absolutely amazing.  If you get a 512mb xd card, you can record movies with sound well over seven minutes long at a 640x480 display, and much longer if you cut the display size.What I really love about this product is the ability to continuously shoot.  Basically, you set the camera to continuous shoot and press the button, the camera will keep taking shots (just under 2 per second) for up to 40 exposures, perfect for my line of work.Also, it's extremely lightweight.  At just under 12 oz, the batteries are the heaviest part of the camera (4 AA).The flash works perfectly, providing ample illumination even at full 10x zoom.You can take video while zoomed in, something else my stylus cant do.  I love being able to zoom in on something far away (again, sporting events) and capture the movement.  My old camera would only record videos with the zoom pulled all the way back.Now for the Cons:-It's a hog for memory on your computer.  A full length video of over 7 minutes comes near half a gig of memory on my laptop (i know, obvious, a 512 mb card = half a gig no matter what media you put on it, so this is something every camera will do).  Just making sure that people are aware that if they're planning on making a series of longer movies or taking a giant amount of pictures, as with any camera, it would be a good idea to invest in a burner.-You're going to need add ons.  The price of this camera alone is amazingly fair for what it can do.  I would highly recommend buying a larger xd memory card to accompany it though.  Depending on your needs, anywhere between 128 and 512 megs should be fine.  You just cant utilize everything this camera is capable of doing with only 16 megs of space.  Also, I'd consider picking up the case and possibly a battery recharger so you don't end up spending a chunk of money every so often on one time use batteries, but that's up to you.In Conclusion:I would highly recommend one of the finepix cameras, and though I didn't pick it out as it was a gift, and I had no previous loyalty to fuji, I'm a believer now.  The s5100 appears to be middle of the road for their non pro series of finepix, you can go higher or lower based on your needs, but this camera really can do it all.It's excellent for a wide field of consumers.  Those who are brand new to digital photography will find it easy to learn, the centering and automatic tools will make taking snapshots a breeze.  The more experienced users will enjoy the bevy of advanced features it offers.  The video makers will enjoy the quality of the images they record.Great camera, moreso when compared with others in its price range.  A wonderful gift.", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price!", "Author": "EB \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R3EANE90L27FX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a couple of months now and overall am very pleased with it. It is easy to use and a pleasure to use.  It has excellent battery life when used with good NiCad's AA rechargeable batteries (no proprietary battery). It is not a full sized SLR though it looks like one and it is not a pocket sized digital camera but the size fits nicely in between the two.  It has a good grip and feel to it.Pluses include:  Fairly compact. 10X Zoom is great and moves fast. Good range flash. Auto focus works well except when in macro mode. Outside images look very good most of the time. Low light shooting is excellent as is the red eye reduction.  Movie mode is also excellent 30fps 640 X 480and works well in low light. --though you cannot move zoom. Microphone pics up audio well.  Movie mode rivals that of standard DV movie camcorder though you need large memory card of at least 256mb. Menu system is also excellent and easy to navigate. Sharp but small 1.5 inch LCD screen.Minuses include:  Macro mode does not work well no matter what the setting, cannot use zoom during movie mode, comes with only 16mb XD memory card, software not great but if you have imaging software on your computer and Windows XP you do not need to install the Fuji software.  There is no manual focus ring control you have to use buttons on back of camera.  You can an only select between 1, 2 or 4 megapixels modes but can switch between them easily. Small but sharp and clear 1.5 inch LCD screen.Overall I would recommend the Fuji s5100 for beginners to intermediate photographers.  It has good auto (no need to touch) mode and good manual controls for intermediate and advanced users. It is not too big nor too small and fits in the hand nicely. The Fuji s5100 is easy to use, takes good pictures and movies and has a great and easy to use menu system. No proprietary battery system just plain old AA's.  If you use rechargeables they last a long time.", "Date": "November 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Digital Camera", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R23DK7DHBHIQ00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read many reviews of the S5100 and have found that many of the pros have addressed the pros/cons of this camera ad nauseam. So I will simply add info that you won't find in most websites:* Use a low ISO setting for reduced noise in the picture. I found the lowest setting, 64 ISO, gives me the least noise in my photos (indoors and outdoors).* You don't need a 256MB or 512MB xD card unless you're going to be outside away from a PC for extended durations. I bought a 128MB card becauase it was inexpensive and holds 66 high quality pics (4MP in FINE mode, 6:1 compression) which is about 3 rolls of film. If I was going to take lots of photos for a week out in some excursion, I'd probably buy a few of the 512MB cards. If you want to just mess around and take snaps for your blog, website, or a school newspaper or project, the 128MB comes at a great price and offers decent storage size.* Definitely get NiMH rechargeable batteries with the highest capacity. For a recharger, I recommend the Maha Powerex. I'm using Energizer AA 2.5 AH NiMH batteries and they've lasted at least a week.* Remember to use the MACRO (Flower) feature for taking very close pics. If I can get the detail off of the center electrode from a Motorcraft spark plug, so can you.* Definitely get a filter!!The lens adapter that comes with the S5100 takes a standard 55mm filter. I recommend Hoya Multi-Coated filters as they appear almost invisible to the naked eye. I thought the store sold me a metal ring until I saw a reflection of the glass. Remember those Lenscrafters Invisibles commercials? The coatings on each side of the glass allows for 97%-99% light transmission with minimal reflectivity. That is why they appear almost invisible!The Fuji lens cap will NOT work with a 55mm filter, so you will need a 55mm snap-in lens cap along with a Sima Cap Keeper II.The filter protects your camera lens from damage. If you crack the filter it is only a few bux to replace compared to a new camera lens.* Get a camera bag. The Fuji holster is a piece of garbage worth only about 1/4 the asking price. Get a decent mini zoom SLR camera bag.Overall, the S5100 is NOT a Canon Rebel Digital SLR, but it worked just like my Minolta 35mm film SLR.You get 10x optical zoom, and up to 36x digital+optical zoom in the 0.03MP mode. At 36x you can actually pick out the details from your subject.The 640x480 VGA video looks spectacular. VGA mode is about 80MB/min while the 320x240 mode is 40MB/min.What remains to be the seen is the durability of the S5100 in a mid to long term fielding.", "Date": "March 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "D. WELSH \"Coffee Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R85EAGLQ3EBJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid SLR fan and this is my first digital camera.  I love it's SLR like shape without being all that big.  I've been playing with the camera taking video, black and white pix and of course lots of color shots.  My daughter plays soccer so I've been taking action shots and they come out great.  The video is crisp and clear.  I love that I can play the video and pics through my VCR to my TV and also play with them on my computer.The only negative is that the flash doesn't automatically pop-up when it's needed, you get an icon displayed on the LCD or optical viewer telling you the light is too low.  I love the optical viewer's adjustments so I can see without my glasses.  The LCD is small but good enough to give you a rough idea of how the pictures turned out.  Viewing them on a computer or TV is the best way to see the true picture quality.  The software that comes with the camera is marginal, I have other photo software that works better in editing and viewing the pictures.  Also, since this camera uses AA batteries you will never be stuck with a dead battery and no way to recharge it.  I did purchace the 256mb XD card and rechargeable batteries for this camera, shop around, prices really vary!!", "Date": "November 14, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "David Prowitz", "ReviewID": "RJM7SZRY9OJ2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a bit of research, looking for a sub-$500 camera that would perform most of what I could do with my extensive 35mm SLR outfit, I decided on the S5100 & I'm happy with my purchase. It's much easier to take along than a larger camera, so you're more liable to have it when you come across those unexpected shots.Battery life is fine, and the fact that it takes standard AA size batteries vs a specialized lithium or rechargable battery pack was another factor in my choice of this camera. Although the standard alkalines included w/ the camera were sucked dry the first day I had it, I picked up 2 sets of 2500mAh NiMH rechargables & they perform great.I printed my first 8x10 the other day & it turned out great - ended up framing it & hanging it in our guest room. At 4mp Normal Mode, the detail is incredible. I highly recommend getting a large capacity xD card, though (at least 128mb.) The 16mb card included with the camera is a joke, holding only 8 pictures at maximum resolution (4mp Fine Mode.)I know there's better cameras out there (I still drool over the $1000 & up digital SLRs), but for the price, this camera will keep you busy & happy for quite a while.", "Date": "December 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "You can trust your photo memories with this one", "Author": "Trojan LRey \"trojanlrey\"", "ReviewID": "RMZYY8ALPRXBU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had the Fuji S5100 exactly one year now.  Meant to write a review after our Hawaii trip last year.  Just back from second annual trip and remembered that I hadn't entered a review yet.First - you'll be more satisfied the more you use it.  This is my 5th digital camera and first Fuji.  It's really grown on me.My wife rarely uses it since I take virtually every photo.  But when she does, I just set it to AUTO, remind her how to zoom, and find that the pic's are just fine.I use a 512mb xD.  I routinely fill up a card on one set of batteries (almost all of my shots are at the 2mp setting which are just fine for most any purpose).  But beware - use only high quality digital batteries. If you are on a budget, here's a surprising find - buy the Kirkland 40-ct box at Costco.  It's only about $11 and they are conveniently shrinkwrapped in 4-ct bundles - great for packing an extra set.  These are far better than any other generic or store brand versions and rival the special batteries for digital products.With a 512MB card, I never deplete batteries by reviewing/deleting photos in camera. Download using a card reader and do your purging on the PC instead. Shots you might have deleted using the LCD may turn out to have an interesting look when seen on computer. And, unless you really have to use the LCD, learn to use the viewfinder it matches the final shot pretty well and it's more discreet.Here's a fail-safe insurance tip for good shots. Use fast shutter mode. There's a special button for this on the top of the camera.  This allows 3 shots at a time in rapid succession.  You can select first 3, last 3 or bracketing mode. I use last 3 for almost every photo. Just depress the shutter and the camera starts shooting. When you release, the last 3 shots are saved.  I always find at least one keeper. (bonus tip - only in AUTO mode, you can squeeze off up to 40 in a row - try it at knee level while following your toddler or during the last 10 yards before a finish line).I get incredible indoor shots without a flash, using Sports mode with fast shutter while increasing the ISO to 400. Be sure to resist the urge to zoom too far, the shots get darker and fuzzier in dim light.  Use widest mode and move yourself closer.  Great for photos of the talent show without  distracting the performers with a flash.I recently discovered a cool new technique using Continuous AF and Aperture mode.  Open up the Aperture to the highest level, set your ISO to 64, and find a still subject with an interesting background.  You'll get an ultra crisp detailed view of your subject with the background blurred slightly.  Very professional!I use a tiny 6 inch tripod for night shots.  There are two timer modes.  One for 10 seconds and one for 2 seconds.  Use the 2 second mode when you are not in the shot.  Be sure to use bracket mode to squeeze off 3 shots in a row. You'll get one regular, one brighter, and one darker shot to choose from later.One technique I started using is utilizing more candid shots with less posing. You can turn off the beeper and false-click sound using Set Up mode so your subjects are less aware. While getting the family to line up for a group shot, try squeezing off a few fast-shutter shots as they are moving around.  You can quietly zoom in on a smaller group and get some very interesting and touching photos and they'll never know.I think it has a relatively fast response time.  It helps a lot if you can frame your shot before hand but it's not really necessary.  Just squeeze half-way down so that all you need to do is squeeze all the way at the right moment.  When I can't frame the exact shot, just pick a spot approximately the same distance and frame that as a substitute.  This works well when there's lots of light.Why won't I give this 5 stars?  It's a bit too big to be ultra portable in a briefcase or purse (I travel a lot) and I find that some colors appear bland. I fix a fair amount with a photo editor. But it's still my favorite camera.", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent step up in digital cameras", "Author": "Kenneth R.

The 10X optical zoom was a major feature that I was looking for and it provides closeups that are crisp and clear.

The manual is clear and easy to follow.This is not a beginners camera but Fuji has made it easy enough for the interested novice to get excellent results with a very small learning curve.

Herbst", "ReviewID": "RMGDK8T0GIM15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera's flaws may irritate more seasoned and adept photographers than me. However, for the amateur looking for room to grow, this camera is a great value for the money. I was drawn to the S5100 because of its automatic and manual settings. I figured that I could slowly learn how to use the more advanced functions while still being able to take photos. The 10x optical zoom is a major bonus. The colors fade a bit at full zoom, so you won't get the same terrific, sharp images as at lower magnifications, but it still beats the heck out of the point-and-shoot 3x optical zoom cameras.I've owned the S5100 for over a year, and though I love it, it has a few significant shortcomings:1. While it takes beautiful pictures in bright sunlight, indoor non-flash pictures taken without the aid of a tripod are often blurry. The S5100 takes some beautiful night shots (with tripod), however.2. Shutter speed on automatic settings is slow, and start-up once you turn it on takes too long. Also, if you turn the camera off, and then immediately turn it on again, it often won't turn on. You need to wait a beat after turning it off before turning it on again. It's not that annoying because you don't often need to immediately turn it back on after turning it off.3. The view-finder is digital, not optical. When you look through it, you're seeing a digital image, and not actually looking through a lens. I find it difficult to see the image in the viewfinder, so I only use the LCD screen. Unfortunately, the LCD screen is hard to see when it's very sunny.4. It's hard to take incognito shots, because the camera makes a lot of noise (beeping when it turns on, and an artificial film-camera-type \"click\" when it takes a photo).That said, I love this camera and would buy it again. I live overseas and often post photos of my travels online to send to friends and relatives back home. They always ooh and ah over my photos and frequently ask what sort of camera I have.

The camera is so easy to use and is light but sturdy. If I had to make one criticism it would be that right off the bat you need to purchase a larger memory card, plus all the rechargeable batteries and something to transfer the pics with. Those items add up quickly to about another $100 on top of the camera price. I feel the camera should come with some if not all of those things.

I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue.My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls.The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating.Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.

Other postive aspects, it does not drain battery and it uses AA batteries, which means when you run out, you can pretty much purchase them anywhere and get back into action. The negative side is that it does not take pictures as well compared with the Canons in darker areas. The LCD view finder is smaller and not as clear as the canons. When used all 10x, it has a problem with auto focusing. But with the price tag on its quality, one cannot really complain, compared with other cameras with 10x, you are really getting a good deal. Also, of course, quality compared to the G5 is lower, but the G5 still cost over 350 bucks while this guy cost is around 250.

If you are well versed in photography, this camera is for you. If you are just a point and shoot kind of person, this camera has too many functions that it wouldn't be worth it. I purchased a 1G memory card that will store over 1000 pictures (the camera comes with one that only saves like 20 photos). The software is easy to use and has nice photo viewing and editing capability. The only caveat is that the size makes it too bulky to take along everywhere so it can only be used in planned outings, not something you carry around with you daily, thus stripping you of your random photo op. One other thing that I have trouble with is that if the settings are not perfectly adjusted in some low light situations, the pictures come out blurry. But it does take really great flash photos and some settings make the night look like daytime.

It is shaped nicely and fits well in my hand.I haven't got a chance to play with all the different settings but the basics work very well.  The battery life seems decent to me, but I would reccomend recharables to save money in the long run.I have two 128 MB memory cards which hold about 130 pictures each at its highest resolution, which is enough for me.  It comes with a 16 MB one, but I haven't touched it.I do wish it had an optical view finder instead of a digital one..  it can be hard to see in a bright area, but it isn't impossible to use.  Also, some kind of image stabilizer would have been a nice add on but it isn't too hard to get a clear shot while zoomed in all the way.Overall, it is a very nice camera and I would recommend it.", "Date": "December 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Mid-Sized Digital Camera", "Author": "J. Boyer", "ReviewID": "R134JJ0KYMW02O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After suffering with a pocket-sized digital camera that took great pictures at the cost of very short battery life, I bit the bullet and started shopping for a new model. I had already decided it had to use rechargeable AA batteries and it had to have an optical zoom of 8x or better.In looking at the various models that met the criteria, most were in the $600+ range and quite bulky. The Fuji S5100 looked to be a bit smaller, and the price looked almost too good to be true. When I finally got to see one in person, I was very impressed. So much so, I bought it on the spot.I spent an entire Saturday playing with all the features and shooting pictures at the dog park. I never used up the first set of AA NiMH batteries, even after reviewing and later downloading over 100 photos. I'm still working on the same batteries days later.I really have only two minor issues with this model. Unlike my old pocket camera, it lacks an optical viewfinder, which allows you to turn off the LCD for longer battery life, as well as track  moving subjects accurately. More annoying is that some of the features require two fingers or two hands to activate.Get at least a 256 Mb xD card, get a 4 AA charger that will work in the car or house, two sets of AA NiMH batteries and a LowePro small SLR case and you are good to go.", "Date": "October 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "great  to hold but has major faults", "Author": "Harold Malmstrom", "ReviewID": "R23XDRGQA0WLJX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd digital camera, previous 2 were Canon's.After 2 days of ownership here is my observations of the Fuji S5100;Plus's; great finish and shape, easy to hold, feels great in your hands, secure and solid, 10x zoom is great, aux. filter holder is a nice touch and should be kept on with a skylight filter to keep out dust (except when using flash in macro mode, it causes shadows.) Layout is ok, but could have been even better, I think zoom control would have better placed around shutter as a rocker switch, and the on/off switch placed on back. its a bit more difficult to fumble for W & T switch on back of camera, during use.Minus's; (and they are very disappointing;) In dim light view finder and LCD panel are incredibly dim almost useless (even with the light switch and finder brightness adjustment set at max in the settings menu), unless you shoot in daylight only you will not enjoy this camera. AA alkaline battery life is extremely short, in 2 days 3 sets. Software included is minimal at best, almost useless, I still haven't found and easy way to download pic's from card in camera to PC, I finally gave up and bought a xD card to USB adapter (about $24), which I recommend getting (it is easy this way). Instruction book is poorly written, jumping all over the place, it reminds me of the National Electrical Code, it will take a bit of time to get familar with the functions and you'll probably need to keep the book handy for reference.And one more disappointment when trying to register this product online the Fuji web sight kept telling me my phone number was invalid, after trying it ten times or more in several formats I gave up.

Kirchmeier", "ReviewID": "R2WD3TJIDIEJHY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, I am an amateur photographer.  I just wanted something to take pictures at my son's basketball game.  Pretty simple task.I love the look and feel of this camera.  It looks great, fits well in you hand, controls are easy to figure out, and I really like the protective hood.  It starts up fast and is very quick from picture to picture.I really wanted to love this camera but I could not take a decent picture.  If your subject is within flash range, you're fine.  If you are in a well lit area (like a basketball gym or at the camera store)and you don't use the flash, the shutter speed is set extremely slow and you cannot have any movement whatsoever.  This is of course on the full auto mode and I'm sure if you know what you are doing you can take fine pictures in manual but for the point and shoot set, this doesn't work well.  I am comparing this to my Minolta S414 that takes the same paicture just fine in auto with no flash.  I had the clerk in the store try to take a picture with the same results.Maybe I am askign too much but my other camera does just fine in the same situation.  Of the 200 or so pictures I took, I got about 5 that are keepers and none with any movement.", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice Little Camera for a Beginner", "Author": "K.

In manual mode you can take indoor pictures without flash, so you will not that glar from Flash or red eye.Now the cons:The camera come with only xD card type. They are propritory to Fuji and Olympus Cameras, the xD cards are expensive like 3 times more than Compact Flash(example like we have Sony pushing you to use only memory stick)The camera comes with 16mb, which can hold one picture of RAW type. So you have to get 512MB memory which cost around $65.The camera uses regular 4 AA batteries and fuji gives you one set as starter later you have to buy a minimum of a 4 AA Nimh rechargable batteries and a charger.The download of pictures using USB to PC drains your batteries. Then you will need to get a AC adapter for Download purposes.Conclusion:All the accessories & memory will cost you around $150. For this extra cost you could get a Canon 6.0MP wherein you get better value for the moneyDo you research before you buy a xD type camera!!!", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Camera fine but beware", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RJ5TD8PC2D5MK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera itself if fine but please beware.

Even everyone's favorite villain, Microsoft, allows their products to be used whether or not you are willing to enroll yourself in their databanks.Also, even bad-guys Microsoft allows the use of a telephone to complete their \"anti piracy procedure\" for those whose computers are not hooked up to the internet.
