Unfortunately, the cameras speed at actually taking a picture is horribly slow. By the time you've pressed the shutter button, heard the click, waited a second or two, it would just be getting around to taking the picture. when loaded into the PC the pictures were a major disappointment. Extremely hard to believe the camera is rated at 16MP. My coworker purchased a Fuji XP series camera and it actually does what is advertised. Guess that's why it costs more I guess :)", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "walter s brownlee", "ReviewID": "R2WCQFIKOJ6ZR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife and I hike a lot and we're exposed to rain, sand, ash and dirt. The sand from the ocean beach damaged my last camera. So, my wonderful wife excitedly bought this camera because of the 16 megapixel and durability. But picture taking speed was slow. Image on camera and computer were of very poor quality. Do not buy this camera. Only use it underwater as a shark is about to eat you. Might be good for snorkeling.
