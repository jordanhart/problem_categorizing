What's not to like? It's light weight, easy to use and comes with the right accessories. It doesn't mention anywhere that there is a wrist strap included in the package. It is a much better strap than anything you can buy. Wider and thick nylon webbing. Good match for the camera.Again, great camera! Not afraid to take it out on the water. Which was the main reason I looked at this camera.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "law2003", "ReviewID": "R15CM4J41IPABR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought thus camera for the indestructible part and the advertised ability to take low light pictures  but I have compromised photo quality as a result. I have a little canon that I have been using forever that takes perfectly crisp photos every time, but sometimes integer flash would go off when it shouldn't making the lighting appear strange. So I bought this one. So many if my photos are slightly blurring now.when I take pics of my toddlers they are rarely still and I think  half of these pictures have a slight blur. I am very I satisfied with my purchase and wishing I had bought a waterproof camera at a low price point.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CKYTJFG"}}
