I CAUGHT MY CLEANING LADY STEALING!", "Author": "Gringinha", "ReviewID": "R2K1LHPHR3WJOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because I had a feeling my cleaning lady was going through my purse, etc.I proped it up in my bedroom and what do you know? ... I got footage of her going through my purse, my wallet, trying on my clothes (eeewww!!) and stealing my beauty products.Needless to say we fired her!I agree with all the pros and cons listed for this item.Luckily my room is small, and well lit... so I got great footage!But I can see the drawbacks for those wanting a wider range of area shot and if their area is poorly lit.I must confess that I never did figure out the freaking sensor.  I just did manual recording and had to sift through the footage with no movement on it.  Yes - that SUCKED... but I assume it's my laziness not their fault.  Wish it were easier to set it up though... as I'm not a total retard and have a general knowledge of electronics.So the bottom line is: it served its purpose, I caught the maid red-handed, and I couldn't work the sensor cause it's a pain in the butt.Overall, I'm happy I paid $200 for this because who knows how much more she would have taken!", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Video quality is very poor, motion detection too sensitive", "Author": "atmj", "ReviewID": "RC4FK4IWP9YD2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This sounds like a neat idea in concept as  it provides a means of surveillance in an unobtrusive looking alarm clock form.  However its functionality and video capture  is somewhat limited so setup and results could be problematic.  Please note, no sound is captured in case that is your expectation.AIMING COULD BE CHALLENGING:Given there is no display in this device to accurately aim it, you need to hook it up to a display device.  In my case the two places, I used it the most were near a TV display.  This way I could get an accurate aim.  If you can't do this it is your best guess and you might not get what you want.MOTION DETECTION USAGE:Since there is no display, setting up the sensitivity of motion detection can only be done when connected.  They do this nicely. However I could never get the right mix of sensitivity for the case I was trying to photo graph.  I was pointing outside a window and tree movements were being captured by the camera, so it was running as long as it was light.  Pretty tedious viewing that video as it ran non-stop.  I also found, it is amazing how you can end up pointing out a window when you don't realize it.  I had this unit in my foyer and did not notice that it had the kitchen window in view.  Alas another non-stop video. When I finally had the sensitivity right, the light quality was too poor for the video.VIDEO QUALITY:Video quality not surprisingly is determined by the amount of light on the subject being recorded.  When I had this camera pointing out a window in bright sunlight, it did a passable job of capturing what was going on. However as I mention above, then the motion detection was triggered too often by tree movements and light changes, so it is a fine line.Using this camera indoors, you need to be careful you don't end up with a back-lit situation. I had this camera in my foyer for a bit, to see how well it worked and unbeknowst to me, it was pointing toward a window that determined the brightness of the scene, rendering the rest of the video useless as it was then too dark in other than the window area.The video quality is horrible in even slightly poor lit areas. .  Anyone trying to capture video in all but verty well lit situations would be advised to consider another device. When it is dark, you get nothing.  When it is dim, you get a highly pixelated video that is muddy in the middle and you would be hard pressed to tell if there was a cat, dog or alien in the view.  I could not tell my 20 pound cat from my 7 pound cat.VIEWING VIDEO:This was easy enough and had a fast-forward you could use to rapidly scan your video. However the buttons are a bit unresponsive and you do have a certain amount of trial and error to figure out how it works.You can also pull out the SD card and put it in your computer to view. Mnd you, you need to re-set it up when you put it back in the device.  One time I did this and did not tell it to start recording again, so got nothing for several days until I checked on it next.USAGE IN WORK AREAS:If you are pondering buying this and bringing it to work, to surreptitiously record, I would not recommend this, unless you get written permission by your employer. I know of many cases where employees have been fired for recording anything at work without the subject's permission.  Both sound and video are issues.  Given that this device is clearly appearing to be \"just an alarm clock\", it is a stealth device.SUMMARY:This is a base level recording device. It's usage is limited to only well lit areas.  It captures only video, there is no sound capture, so if that is a requirement, this is not the device for you. The motion detection to limit the video quantity taken is touchy.  When I got the right mix for the motion detection, it sacrificed video quality, to such a degree to render the device almost unusable.  To be honest, I think it is overly pricey for the quality.  Even half this cost would be too much considering the video quality.  NOTE: I'm stating this based on viewing some inexpensive video cameras my son has purchased to wear when skiing or to put on kites. Mind you they did not have motion detection, but the video was much better.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Worth It", "Author": "Anne S.", "ReviewID": "RFAT7JQQBUUL5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Gives a sharp clear image, but with a range of view so limited that it is difficult to see how it could catch anyone doing anything.

You CANNOT tell there's a camera hidden in the case, and it's also a fully-functional clock/alarm clock as well.  I've tried all the modes (manual, timer, and motion-activated), and finally decided to keep it on motion-activated since it only takes up space on the SD card when there's movement to record.  The SD card that's included is plenty of space to record a week's worth of high-quality video.  I simply pulled the card out of the back, and plugged it into my laptop, and was instantly watching the activity in the room. (Thankfully, everyone was behaving, and nothing sprouted legs.)  The controls, SD card, and lens are hidden well enough that you'd really have to be looking for it to uncover its secret.Video quality is better than I expected, and the camera's field of view, while adequate, is somewhat limited.The only downside would be that, for this price, I would have expected to be able to have internet access to monitor live remotely.

This covert camera can keep 24/7 watch on a cash drawer, a liquor cabinet - anything that needs the added security that comes from an extra set of eyes. I have to admit I was a bit giddy with my first piece of spy equipment but the realization comes quickly that this gadget can lead to trouble if misused.Position and lighting are the keys to a successful taping. A well-lit room is important. So is where you position the camera. The higher the better.Defender's top 5 reasons to buy - and my thoughts:* Covert DVR Disguised as an Alarm Clock - This looks like a regular LCD alarm clock. I doubt anyone would notice it houses a security camera.* Record over a month of footage with the included 2GB SD card - I haven't tested these limits but you can record a lot of footage, although I can't think of many applications that would use up to a month of footage.* Motion Activated Recording - For best results, you need to ensure there is proper lighting to optimize results.* Easily Connect to a TV or Monitor - Yes, it is easy to connect and transfer files.* Fully Functional Alarm Clock - This is a bit of a stretch, since the `covert' disguise would be worthless without a fully-functioning alarm clock.In summary, compared with the Swann SWA43-D6C12 Digital Wireless Camera and 4 Channel SD Recorder that I also tested as part of the Amazon Vine(tm) Program, the Defender Alarm Clock DVR with Built-in Color Pinhole Camera excels in stealth but the lack of audio recording ability and the limited field of recording are disappointing.

I was really interested in having a product that could be set to record video (no sound capability)if an area was broken into.  This hidden camera sounded like the perfect solution as it appeared to be no more than an alarm clock.  It could easily be placed in a garage and anyone breaking into it would probably pay no attention to it.Here are the strong points:1.  It looks like just an ordinary cheap alarm clock with large enough digits that someone would use it as a garage clock.  Thus, it would not be a target to steal as it would fetch nothing.2.  The clock function is easy to program.3. The clock uses a standard SD card.  For some reason, mine included a mini-SD in an SD adapter.  So, if you need one of those for some reason, there you go!  The unit actually requires a regular SD card.Here are the weak points:1. a very short power cord.2. This device requires a low resoution video connection to program it or to use any of the features of the camera system.  It requires an RCA connector for the video which would be typical for the last generation of analog TVs.3. The camera is VERY low resolution and it is NOT very sensitive to light.  This means that you need VERY strong lighting of the subject if you actually want to make an identification of the individual.  It it is someone you know, you might be able to guess the identity, but other than that, it is useless.  If the person breaking in is using a flash light for lighting, forget getting an image!4.

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"", "ReviewID": "R2I0B1JGZHG316", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sometimes a situation can arise, when you wish you could have been there, to see what had happened. Worse, is when you KNOW who might have done you harm behind your back, but you have no proof. Having a hidden pair of eyes, in the form of a tiny video camera within a fully functional alarm clock, can be the next best thing to hiding in the closet all day. The video camera within the clock works well enough. The biggest problem I had, was that the video camera required more light to record a recognisable image, than you might at first imagine. (The users guide says the camera can operate with as little as 2 lumens of light, tho I found at least 50 watts of ligth is required in a room, to get an image.) Even on HIGH QUALITY, a low light image can be grainy, monocromatic, with low resolution. So much depends upon how much light is available where you intend to use the unit. If you need a hidden camera for low light condistions, this migth not be the right purchase for you.I was impressed with the amount of options this security camera/DVR recorder gives you, when you are setting up the system for your home or business. A security camera isnt worth much, if it isnt \"ON\" when the crime occurs. And, with a limit to how much the ROM memory card can hold, you will want to pick some option to save on memory. Recording options for saving storage space on the ST300 ROM card, are easy to set up. You just hook the clock up to your TV monitor (It has a yellow \"RCA jack\" video out wire.) Once the TV is reading the security camera, you set up the system to record either thru motion detection, or with one of the following parameters: First,you can set the recorded image on HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW quality. Second, you can have it record an image frame anywhere from once a second, to 30 frames per second. (If selecting the lower resolution setting, it only records from ONE to 15 images per second.) Most systems in public places only records ONE FRAME per SECOND. Third, you can also select how LARGE the image is recorded by the camera. (320x240 -or- 640x480.) Fourth, you can instruct the camera to work only during certain times each day. For example, if the suspect maid or babysitter is in your home from 9am to 3pm, you can have the camera only operate at those times each day. Fifth, you can even combine the selected hours of operation, with the motion detector built into the unit, which turns on only if someone is moving around. ONCE THE ROM CARD is filled up, it circles back and starts to record over the earlier information. (tho you can override that option as well.) Recording lenght is at a premium, so that is why you would want to limit how much unnessacary surveyence the camera records. You migth want to record everything in high resolution, at 30 pictures per second, but you'll only have about 4 or 5 hours before the DEFENDER ALARM CLOCK DVR CAMERA records over earlier information. Personally, even tho you can set up how much sensitivity the camera has for motion detection, I didnt think motion detection worked as well as I imagined it should. I felt better with setting up the camera to record one or two frames per second, on low or midium resolution, during those specific times i KNEW my room was unoccupied. (and illuminated enough so the Spy Camera could record a usable image.)Even tho the set up is VERY user friendly, you will need the instruction book by your side, when you first set up your internal date and time, and the other perimeters. There's this toggle button, a record button, a STOP button (that is also the BACK ONE PAGE button), and a PLAY button. ITs not much different than getting a DVD to play. On the back of the \"clock\" is a covert face plate, that attaches over the DVR recording buttons and ROM card,with a screw. The screw can only be opened with a special \"Allan Wrench\" type screw driver, that comes with the unit. So, it's impossible for anyone to access the back of this clock, even if they DID suspect its a spy-camera. ALso, the RCA jack that connects to your TV monitor, has a strange half inch plug on the other end, that plugs into the spy camera's back, when the facing plate is off. Again, even if someone busted open the innocent looking alarm clock, and saw that it was a spy camera, they wouldnt know how to retrieve the info, without this special wire that has the RCA video jack on one end, and the half inch plug on the other end. Remember to keep those two items in a TOTALLY SAFE place.(Perhaps taped inside the instruction book). You don't need to be a CIA agent to figure out how it works. Seriously.There are more expensive solutions to domestic crime than this spy camera. But if you want to keep an eye on a new babysitter, or watch houseguests, or other LEGAL surveyance activities, this is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to accomplish that. Altho the camera needs at least a light bulb's worth of light to operate well, the DEFENDER ALARM CLOCK DVR SPY CAMERA will work in most well lite situations. If you run into trouble with the setup, or getting the motion detection to operate with enough sensitivity, etc, there is an 800 phone number for tech support. (There's live chat, and an email and fax number as well. This company WANTS to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase.) And, if you dont need to use the spy function for extended periods of time, you still own a nice alarm clock, with HUGE legible numbers. In fact, the more you let this unit just become \"part of the scenery\", the less likely someone will realize you own a covert security camera. After all, if the suspect realizes this is a security camera, you might as well not have one. After all, to avoid detection all you need to do, is cover the camera. So its best to be VERY SECRETIVE about the real nature of this spy camera. (People talk, kids brag, etc.) Even if the camera just explained one mysterious missing piece of jewery, or caught one inattentive babysitter, or alerted a parent to some \"BAD TOUCH\" toward their child, it paid for itself a thousand times over.

Lerch", "ReviewID": "R2JSE20Z537VZW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My disclaimer: I received this through Amazon Vine, which means I received it for free. I review everything I receive through Vine as if I've actually paid for it.I was offered the opportunity to test and review the Defender Alarm Clock DVR w/ Built in Color Camera and jumped on the chance. From a home security perspective this thing could prove quite valuable given it's great concealment capability and if you are concerned with a break in, who in their right mind would steal a camera, right?Well, they squandered the potential with a poor manual and narrow camera window.First, the manual. In order to plug the device into your TV to configure it, you have to remove a rather annoying Torx screw (the star looking thing). The nice thing about this screw is that they've provided a little screw driver in the box (be sure to pull all the cardboard out of the box or you might not be able to find the screw driver or the memory card).So I know WHY they did this. By making the back panel attached with a screw it is more likely a burglar will just skip over this and figure it's just a clock. I'm still wondering why it isn't mentioned in the manual at all or just a standard screw since the enclosed screw driver is pretty puny and most likely easily lost. If you lose the screw driver, the size Torx bit is quite esoteric and I believe the majority of homeowners will NOT have one of these in their arsenal of tools. I know I don't.Configuration is pretty simple. Open the back with the enclosed screw driver. Push the memory card into the device. Plug in the video cable. Plug the other end into the TV. Plug in the power. Power up the TV and set it to the proper input.You navigate the mostly self explanatory menus using a weird joystick kind of thing under the back panel. You can set it up for constant recording or only record when it sees movement. The latter is how I have mind configured as I don't have anywhere I need 24/7 surveilance. And since you can't connect to this remotely from outside of your house (I have other Wi-Fi enabled video cameras), what's the point of 24/7 constant recording anyway?), you will always have to check out the memory card manually which would alert any suspect to the presence of something weird (namely a covert video camera).Video quality is quite nice, however, as another reviewer states, the angle is weird and not very wide, meaning you have quite a narrow recording area. I've had some luck capturing recordings of the dog walking around but if he's not in the perfect place, which is difficult to achieve with this device, he can covertly enter the bedroom and drop hair everywhere.Setting the time on the clock is just like every other alarm clock you've ever owned most likely and easily setup.Overall this is pretty disappointing. The concept of a covert recording device is alluring, but the potential is squandered with an almost adequate manual, poor design decisions and the lack of any remote connection. The only other camera clock device I've seen is the Logitech WiLife Digital Video Security--Hidden Add-On Camera and the biggest problem there is that you need a computer on 24/7 to record; there is no DVR capability.If you need covert recording, this MIGHT meet your needs, however I would temper that by telling you to be aware that it is... limited.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor, inaccurate documentation", "Author": "John Flora", "ReviewID": "R290U9E5ZI8ZF5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I spent my entire adult life writing for a living so I have no handicaps when it comes to understanding the written word, but I have serious problems with the user's manual(s) for the Stealth 300-SD.The manual that came in the box has some major discrepancies with the software.You'd expect a $250 item to be more thoroughly documented than this.Like, for instance, the illustration of the TV connecting cabled shows a Yellow, White, and Red RCA TV input when the enclosed item has only the Yellow video input. However, if you go to the Defender web site and download the PDF user's manual there, it shows the correct cable configuration.But neither manual addresses the issue of audio, even though there is an audio symbol in the monitoring mode screen and this unit apparently can record audio as well as video. But if you try to play the resulting MPEG4 files on Windows Media Player, it balks and says you must first install the Sharp G.726 codec.The manufacturer is apparently aware of these and other discrepancies because the inside flap of the box warns: \"STOP - Do not return this product to the store! Please contact a Defender customer support representative first, regarding any additional information on product features, specifications, or help with setup.\" Points of contact are listed for email, online live web chat, phone and fax.Clearly, they know they have a problem, but much of this hand-holding could have been avoided by enclosing a better written and organized manual.That said, I find it hard to believe that anyone who spent $250 for this thing would't want a refund.The only way to understand all of the features, short of going back to the manufacturer, is through trial and error.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't try hard enough", "Author": "My Fake Name", "ReviewID": "RXOTK8SW401JF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Defender Alarm Clock DVR with Built-in Color Pinhole Camera (Black) ST300-SD is an interesting device, a nanny cam in a working LED alarm clock.  There's a well-hidden CCD camera mounted in the face of the unit, and it records video (no audio) at various degrees of quality, either continuously or only when motion is detected, and optionally on a schedule (although I admit I didn't test this feature, the reasons for which might become clear as you read further).You aim it at what you want it to record and then you wait and later you play back the video it recorded.To get started you insert the supplied 2-gigabyte SD card (which, oddly, doesn't say that it's 2 GB or any other size anywhere on it) or another one up to 32 gigs, and then you connect the product to your television set.  You connect one end of the supplied cable to the device and the other end, a male RCA plug, into the \"Yellow Composite Video Input Jack\" of your television.  Mine worked when the Input button on the TV went to channel 3.It took me about 45 minutes to get this done, which ended up with my hauling a disused but good enough tube TV from the basement up to the second floor, which I resent having to do (and which I will eventually have to do again in reverse).  Perhaps there's a better way, but I don't know what it is, because if you can't see the menus of the device on a screen, you can't program it or really use it at all unless you have already learned exactly how to set it up, which you simply cannot do unless you hook it up to a TV at least once.If I were designing thie software from scratch I would work it out so that the device could be connected to a computer or even a smart phone and not require a special connection to a television.  If this product's software could be controlled from a computer, it would be approximately 178% better, which is a lot.  I subtract 1 star from 5 right off the bat because of this flaw alone.  USB, anyone?  I mean Duuuh!!Once you are connected, figuring out how to control and program this product is difficult.  It's all done with four buttons on the back of the device.  One is STOP, the next is REC, the next is PLAY, and the last is a joystick where you can scroll up, down, left and right as applicable and then press the joystick to choose the selected item, like on a typical camera.The problem is that the interface is, at least for me, obdurately baffling.  It's like the writers wanted to make it almost right but sometimes not quite.  Through trial and error, mostly error, I have figured out certain tricks and workarounds to achieve some but not all of what I want, but the point is that I shouldn't have had to.  You have to spend a lot of time experimenting and testing and re-experimenting and re-testing so many times to figure out how the thing works that I wonder whether version 1.1800 of the software is finished.  For this flaw I subtract one star.Certainly the User's Manual is not finished.  It leaves out some of the useful things I figured out from extensive testing, and I can think of no reason they should be excluded except perhaps to save on paper and ink.  The maker could have, for example, given just one or two examples of a typical way to use it in a particular set of circumsatnces.  If saving paper and ink is the only reason the people who know the most about this product didn't reveal so much useful information they could have, it's a bad one.  For this reason I subtract yet a third star.  I expect more for the price being asked.Once you have recorded your surveillance -- whether a couple minutes or several hours depending on how you have programmed it -- you can play it back on the aforementioned TV or you can play it back on your computer by removing the SD card and plugging it into that selfsame computer.The Lens-- The lens's field of view, which cannot be changed, might not suit your needs.  A smaller focal length lens would cover more territory, but good fish-eye lenses are expensive and cheap ones are worthless.  I think the choice was reasonable.-- The depth of field, which cannot be increased by stopping down the lens, is greater than I would have thought till I tested it.  It can resolve 32ndths of an inch easily when it's about two inches away (which it would never be in practical use, of course), and it can distinguish faces at 10 feet or so.  Still, no matter what, the picture is never what you would call crisp.-- This lens needs a lot of light.  This is a function of how much each such lens costs the manufacturer, and you'd better hope whatever you want to record is pretty well-lit.  If you mount it in a bedroom hoping to catch your spouse being naughty while you're working the midnight shift at the factory, you'd better hope they like to do it with the lights on.The files are saved in the ASF format.  You might want to make sure your computer can play or convert them, but my ancient Windows Media Player version 10 played them OK, although slightly out of order, which might or not be acceptable to you.The back panel, which reveals all the controls that make it obvious this is a nanny cam, can be opened only with the right size Allen wrench, which is supplied.  Speaking of which, this device cannot run on a battery; it has to be plugged into an outlet.And keep in mind that if you hope to catch someone on video clandestinely doing something bad, you've got to somehow aim this clock in pretty much the right direction and hope it doesn't get moved or covered, which is true of pretty much any other nanny cam.As you few fans of my recent reviews know, I go above and beyond to provide unexpected yet useful information not often offered by the more normal reviews of Amazon products.  And I will not disappoint in the case of the ST300-SD.  First, the device is not designed for use by scuba divers or even snorkelers.  After an accidental immersion in my full bathtub, which was only about 8 inches deep, the Defender Alarm Clock DVR with Built-in Color Pinhole Camera did not recover well at all.  I suspect it suffered from the bends, which is the condition in which nitrogen in your blood expands too quickly if you rise from depth too fast, as you no doubt know.  Whatever the reason, after the immersion the product -- even after several hours in a hyperbaric chamber -- did not work nearly as well as it did before.  For example, the REC light that used to be plainly green is now covered in a sort of film that makes it appear more brown.  I'm not saying this is confusing or a problem or anything, I'm just saying the manufacturer doesn't specifically warn against immersing the device in eight inches of bathtub water, which -- I admit-  did contain a lot of Soapy Kidz Bubbles bubbles.Second, because this device has no microphone (and doesn't claim to, for that matter), it cannot record any sounds whatsoever.  I know because I shouted at it pretty loud while it was recording, and upon playback it played back absolutely no sounds whatsoever.  I even got some of my neighbors all to shout really loud at it at the same time and to clap and to shoot off guns and stuff, and it still did not record even a fortieth of a single sone.In summary, finally, in the end, ultimately I conclude the ST300-SD needs work and will prove to be worth your money only in rare circumstances.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spy clock", "Author": "Diane Kistner", "ReviewID": "REZMEBJUGOCIA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This clock is probably just the thing for someone who suspects a partner of hanky panky at home in their absence. Strategically placed at the bedside, the range of this camera could certainly capture enough to show if a significant other has been partying while one is away. (Would the video be admissible in court? I'm not a lawyer, but the question strikes me as awfully \"twentieth century.\") Potential voyeuristic uses also come to mind, but the thought of that is disturbing.I was given this product free to review. It is not a product I would have bought on my own because I'm not paranoid enough to want to spy on people. Now, don't get me wrong: I love the large, highly visible LED clock face. I can see it all the way across the room with my glasses off. It's handsomely styled and does not look cheaply made. But would I pay several hundred dollars for it? I don't think many people would, at least not without a wireless/remote viewing component to it. That kind of capability would make this spy clock valuable from a real-time monitoring perspective as long as the range of view does not extend past the camera's focus--placed beside a sickbed or crib, perhaps. Setup is already much harder than it should be, however, so they'd need to work on making it more plug-and-play.This little spy clock does do two things very well: (1) it does not give its true spy-clock function away, and (2) if the person planting the clock does not want anyone else to discover that they are being videotaped, screwing the back cover down with, then hiding, the tiny little allen wrench will ensure nobody will be able to get the back open to find out what's really inside--not without completely destroying the clock, anyway. (For those who are less concerned about discovery, the back cover snaps on and stays on without the locking screw, making it easier to get to the card for viewing. This is important to know in case you lose your little allen wrench.)One final thing that I give this product credit for is its portability. Certainly, there are monitoring cameras that have a greater range, but these mostly have to be installed in a fixed position. This clock can be moved as easily as the alarm clock it looks like. It is not battery operated, and I expect it would not work very reliably off of a battery. But as long as you have an electrical outlet, you can secretly record activity within the spy clock's range.Some may find this product to be so \"Mission Impossible\" cool that it's worth the price.
