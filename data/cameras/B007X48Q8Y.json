She has only used point and shoot cameras but hasnt had any trouble figuring out how to use this one. Everything in this bundle works great and nothing has a \"cheap feel\" to it. Would recommend this to any beginner. One thing we have noticed is the camera doesnt seem to focus as well using the screen for taking pics which isnt a big problem because it saves battery not using it. I am going to look into that and see if theres something we need to do different or if it just takes longer to focus when using screen.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) + <2> Nikon 55-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Transcend 16GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <5> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<7> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <8> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <9> Precision Design 57\" Tripod +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> Transcend SD Memory Card Case + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) + 55-300mm VR Lens + 16GB Card + Flash + Case + Filters + Remote + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w9bemgJjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007X48Q8Y"}}
