The reason we chose this item was because it was damage resistant and bright to find if set down outside. {The bride lost her first camera, so we needed something to help combat that.}They took it to Cancun and had it in and out of the water for 7 days straight. The camera freezes if it goes past 10 feet, they learned, but if you follow the cleaning instructions, it'll come out unscathed. Which to me, is amazing and totally worth the money!It has several features they've found awesome and helpful, the slideshow when looking for a specific picture, the option to take several pictures at once and have it merged together as one was another.The reason for only 4 stars is the battery life. The camera dies after about 150 pictures, and that is honestly a downer. Especially if you want to take it anywhere that you'll be snapping several pictures...usually vacations.However the quality of the photos, the amazing durability of the camera, and the fun color options, can outweigh the one negative. Just charge it often, or buy a second battery to keep as a backup.I am going to buy one for myself, I'm that sold on it!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Truly Tough", "Author": "Scott Edward Larosa", "ReviewID": "RC286FBXIX3DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This'll be my third model and fifth camera of the Stylus Tough series.

Took a couple of pictures before the trip just to make sure it worked, and all seemed good.The first 5 days of the cruise (including 2 snorkeling expeditions where I didn't get near to 10 feet underwater), it worked great.  Good color rendition, and the panoramic feature was so much more simple than other point-and-shoot digital cameras that I have had.  The pictures were nice, and it worked great under water.  Sadly, towards the end of the 5th day, the view screen stopped working. It would come on for a couple of seconds and then go blank.  I recharged the battery a couple of times, and even tried our spare battery, but that didn't help.The camera didn't leak in the battery compartment, so if it was caused by water leaking in, it came from some other part of the camera.Fortunately, we had our Kodak digital camera with us on the trip, so we were still able to take lots of pictures of the Bahamas and Key West.Sadly, the Olympus went back to the store for a refund.  If it couldn't hold up on a fairly tame cruise, I just couldn't justify getting a new one for potential future vacations like white water rafting that I would want a waterproof, shock-friendly camera for.I have a good Canon DSLR for serious photography.  We bought this camera to take snapshots on the cruise, and for future vacations.  The camera has nice features, and worked great while it worked.  Sadly, since it didn't last 5 full days, I really wouldn't recommend buying one.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific Buy!", "Author": "Portia", "ReviewID": "R2UEROKMGCOMY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and floating case prior to a cruise with some friends and it is WORTH EVERY PENNY.  We swam with stingrays, snorkeled, explored caves, kayaked, and hung out in the pool and got terrific pictures without having to worry about damaging the camera.  Features are easy-to-use and can also do panoramic photos; battery life is a bit limited but I solved this by buying a second battery--extremely afforadable on Amazon.  Takes great pictures EVEN UNDERWATER (I used a 8gig memory card and saved all photos on the highest resolution so they'll print out suitable for hanging up at home later) and good indoor/non adventure kind of pictures.

It was my first waterproof camera and I was really impressed with the price and what it could do.  WARNING:  Make sure to LOCK the camera when you are using it in and under water.  I did not and the second day of owning it I got it filled with salt water and couldn't use it for the rest of the trip.  Thankfully, Olympus stayed true to their warranty and when I arrived home from the cruise sent it in to get fixed, free of charge.  Good company and good camera!  Very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great compact waterproof camera", "Author": "Anhtuan Phan", "ReviewID": "R26J8X4Y7GOJAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rated this camera 5 stars because I was looking for a waterproof, compact camera that takes decent pictures.  This camera does all of that.  I'm not comparing it with a full size digital SLR.  And for under $140 with free shipping from Amazon, it's a good deal.I bought this camera for a trip to the Caribbean.  It was in the water several times, up to 4 feet deep.  It worked flawlessly and stayed bone dry.  Be sure to rinse it in clean tap water, wait for it to dry completely before opening.The shell is aluminum which makes it heavy duty.  The exposures and colors are fairly accurate even indoors with flash.  Sharpness is adequate for this type of camera.  I'm particularly impressed with the quality of the pictures in the macro mode.  There are 2 things that I don't like:1. In the battery saving mode, the screen turns off after only about 2 seconds, making it a little annoying.  To turn it back on, you press lightly on the shutter release.  You can turn off this mode but cannot extend the time.2. It does not come with an external battery charger.  The battery has to be charged while inside the camera.  I solved this problem by buying an external charger from eBay.  You may also consider getting a second battery for convenience.The controls are small so if you have big fingers or wear gloves, you may have difficulty.  But again, this is a compact camera that fits in your shirt pocket.The manufacturer says that you need to replace the waterproof seal once a year but that's true for all waterproof cameras.  I find that the seal will last a longer if you leave the battery door open during storage.  That way there's not constant pressure on the seal.I purchased this camera at the same time as the Panasonic Lumix TS3.  Although both cameras are about the same, the Olympus' pictures are a lot sharper that of the Panasonic.  I was surprised because the Panasonic had a Leica lens and cost more.  Figure that!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had Such High Hopes", "Author": "AzraelX7", "ReviewID": "R33R1ADMA0RMZ4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for two specific reasons.  First, I have owned an Olympus FE-280 for a long time and taken well over 50,000 pictures with it.  Until recently, I've never had a problem with that camera, and even now it's still excellent 90% of the time.  The FE-280 was left out in the rain once, and washed in the washing machine after being left in a pocket, and both times it came out with no damage.  Second, I took a vacation to Puerto Rico earlier this summer, and knew I'd be taking the camera to the beach, snorkeling and kayaking, etc.  I wanted a camera that would take awesome pics and be able to stand up to some abuse.First, let me say that I love the picture quality and features included with this camera.  The pictures were always sharp, in focus and with excellent color reproduction.  Video and sound quality with this camera were also very good.  The other features, such as photo modes, panoramic, etc are all excellent and easy to use.  I particularly like the super macro mode.  You can get in really close for some very pretty shots.  The advanced adjustment features let you control many aspects of your shooting.  Not as much as a DSLR, but more so than many point and shoot cameras.That said, one of the primary reasons I wanted this camera was for it's waterproofing.  This turned out to be it's only major failure.  There is a door on the side of the camera for access to battery and memory card slots, as well as USB and HDMI ports.  The door has a rubber seal and lock, but it's weak point is the hinge.  This is where the leakage occured in my camera.  It was never much, but in sensitive electronic devices, a drop is all it takes.  About half way through our vacation, my wife and I discovered that water was leaking in.  It would cause the camera to unexpectedly shut off or become completely inoperable.  Salt water also corroded the contacts inside the HDMI port, rendering it unusable.  If we set the camera out and let it dry, it would be fine and continue working after a couple hours.  But who wants to put a vacation on hold to wait for a camera to get working?  Luckily, we also brought the old 280 and my Canon 60D DSLR, so we had plenty of opportunities to take lots of pics.So, if this had been a normal, non-water proof camera, I would rate it 5 stars across the board.  As I mentioned above, picture, video, sound and feature quality are great.  As of right now, we've sent the camera in for warranty service.  We'll see how that works out.  I will post an update later to see how the camera is after that.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product...so far", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3OQBK9RB28TNU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is great for the money.

Wehrheim \"Product Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3SKSNDYWVB3E7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Holden Beach. Tested the video and pictures at home first and all was good. I kept this camera in my pocket on the beach and got some great pics and video of the kids playing in the water. That lasted two days. On day 3 it started to malfunction and the screen was just glowing - no video or menus. I noticed condensation behind the LCD. Water had seeped behind the LCD screen and the thing died. I was never in the water over my head. I'm 5'10\" and only think I'm 10' tall! It was a great concept for 48 hours and I love the pictures and video I got in those 2 days. Luckily I bought it at Sam's days before my trip and had no problem returning. I might buy one again before my next trip - kind of a disposable camera!I was looking at the Fuji just a few minutes ago and seems it gets low ratings and is not waterproof. People with those camera's are reporting that Fuji does not warranty cameras that go under water - hilarious!  Looks like we'll need to wait a couple of years and a few more versions until digital cameras of this type are functional.I'm going back to my 15 year old Canon Sureshot WP-1 35mm.

I tested it out and it works underwater.  I just got this but all of the modes and stuff make up for the picture quality. Although the picture quality is OK(around 10-ish megapixels if you ask me) it's enough for it's original purpose, to go underwater(take abuse, etc.) and still be able to take pictures.  I am bringing this awesome little camera to the cruise in which I am going on in a few weeks and I know all of my friends will be jealous.  The great part about this camera is that the charger works on USB so I can charge it with my phone, and my iPod Touch(I bought adapters for all of these).  The video is OK, and the pictures are pretty good.  The flash is nice and bright and all of the settings(ISO and exposure and more)certainly help.  Although it's not the best camera in the world and doesn't take the best pictures or videos in the world they are still good enough to crop and print out for a nice clear picture and this is SO WORTH it for the price considering some of the \"better cameras\" are over $250.  The buttons are OK because most of them click so you know you've pushed them and they are all pretty responsive.  I WAS a LITTLE worried about the zoom because those don't click but they are still very responsive.  NOTE: They work a little better on mine if you push a little toward the middle of the zoom panel.Also, the zoom is only 3.6X but that is enough for me because I will pretty much only be using this is for it's main purpose, the take pictures underwater.  The screen size is pretty good, considering it is such a minute camera.Overall, great camera for the price as I have said a few times already in this review.  Hope this helped future buyers out there.Thanks for your time,Jasmine", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera is not tough or waterproof", "Author": "Darren Knott", "ReviewID": "R1JAVWAWSN5CCD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just found out that Olympus is going to charge me the price of a new camera after their previous warranty repair didn't work.  I'm very upset that this camera has not only not lived up to expectations, but didn't even live up to my expectation for a non-tough, non-waterproof camera.  Here's the story.I'd had the camera for about a week when we decided to climb around on some waterfalls.  The camera worked great until I decided to swim across the pool at the bottom with the camera in my pocket.  When I got to the other side and tried to take a pic, I noticed the LCD had water in it.  I checked the lock on the side and made sure I had closed the lid tight.  The camera lid was locked and was sealed tight.However, when I opened it, water came trickling out.  On a whim, I tried blowing on the tripod mount hole.  Air went through it just like I was blowing on a straw.  I guess that's where my leak came from.I was pleasantly surprised when I sent it to Olympus and they said it was covered under warranty.  Despite a month long wait, I was very happy when my camera came back. It seemed to work fine, that is until a couple days later when I went to power up and hear a strange grinding noise.The camera had been in my bag or pocket, so it had been protected and I'm sure nothing happened to break it. Since I'd previously had such a good warranty experience, I sent it back to Olympus but was bitterly disappointed this time, to see that they are going to charge me the full price of the camera.  I've barely used this thing and it's already broken so bad that they want to totally refurbish it.I'd been very happy with Olympus up to this point, but if they don't make this right, I can warranty one thing...I'll never buy an Olympus product again.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Cheryl Hood", "ReviewID": "R2QBEUZ2NW2G3Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a family vacation/cruise where I wanted to be able to take photos on the beach and while snorkeling.

Out of the water, it's pretty darn good too. If what you want outside is too bright or dark, tilt the camera up or down and when it exposes correctly, hold in your take button half way, tilt back down to your pic, and click it the rest of the way! My only complaint is that it needs a little more contrast and saturation. I just opened the pics with Windows Live Photo Gallery, and hit auto-fix, which fixed most of them great.

Once the camera dried, I opened the battery compartment to find water inside and when I pulled out the battery, some corrosion had built up. We were at the mercy of the island we were on and paid triple the price for a new Olympus but tried a different model. That camera had failed on us the first day of use. I was  dissapointed not only for losing such great pictures but in the Olympus brand. I was not able to get a refund for the camera purchased on the island but was given store credit which was better than nothing at all. I hope to get refunded from the Amazon buyer I purchased it from.

I bought this camera when I thought that it was completely waterproof (not to just 10') and took it on my honeymoon to Scuba Dive in the Dominican Republic.  While I didn't take the camera on deep dives, it survived snorkeling and bouncing off rocks just fine.  I have lots of great under water photos.  Plus we did an adventure trip of scaling up a series of 7 waterfalls.  This involved (wet) rock climbing and swimming.  The whole time I just had my camera's wrist strap attached to the buckle of my life vest.  Beautiful photos every time.Downsides:1) I do recommend buying a spare battery and charger for the camera.  Each battery seems to only last for about 5-6 hours of constant use.  Also leaving the battery in the camera over night seems to drain the battery a little.  Always start each day with a fresh fully charges battery.2) The camera is not that good long distance shots indoors.  Outside it is great and close up indoors it is good.3) It is also not the best at action shots.  Like most inexpensive digital cameras there is a delay between clicking the button and when the actual picture is taken.

What bells and whistles!  It seemed perfect that this camera is rugged and waterproof.  It looked so good on paper.  I decided not to go with my gut (buy Canon or Sony says my gut).I took the camera back the next morning.  The battery can be put in backwards, which could damage the camera (according to the instructions).  Lame.  The pictures I took had a poor color quality with WAY too much noise for a 14.1MP photo (my old 7.2 Cybershot looks a billion times better). I switched from auto-mode to auto white balance mode and then to sunny setting WB, but it never improved the coolness of the pictures.  The red eye reducer worked well.  The video was not bad at all - 720p works for me.  The USB will charge the camera when plugged in and looked very convenient.  A little too feature rich for me - though it can be lots of fun to play around!I am so disappointed after being completely let down by this camera.  It really looked fantastic.

Make sure to read all the directions.  You need to rinse any sand and salt water off the camera before opening it.  The sand and salt could be trapped underneath the battery door gasket and prevent you from getting a water tight seal.

The video and pictures came out terrific.  So I wanted to give it a try on just normal pictures too and I must say, it takes pretty darn good normal pictures too.  The only thing that I would knock it for is that underwater the LCD screen is sometimes hard to see if it's bright out.  Overall, I would definitely purchase this camera again.  I hope it lives up to it's \"Tough\" namesake and lasts awhile!", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Underwater Camera - Leaked but repaired with warranty", "Author": "Here-o", "ReviewID": "R2JPUG1BHQPXSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after thoroughly researching underwater cameras for a trip to the Galapagos where I would spend 8 days on a boat and really no access to civilization. I needed something that would be durable, something that could be dropped in case I was clumsy, something that could take pictures underwater as well as out of the water in case I saw something on the water's surface, easy to use-- I wasn't going to fiddle with settings, could take video in case sea lions wanted to play with me in the water, could go underwater at least 10 feet (even though I only float on the water's surface, I know that I'll be sticking my arm out with the camera so you have to account for some of that), and couldn't have external moving parts becuase I didn't want sand to get caught in the parts or chances for the moving parts to get bumped and broken. You could easily spend $300-$400 for an underwater camera with these features. I ultimately decided that I wouldn't spend more than $175 because I had to budget for the trip. I was taking my big digital SLR camera so I could take high quality out-of-water pictures so I didn't need the best overall camera. BTW, I purchased the orange color because I wanted something bright that would stick out in almost any condition in case I dropped it or needed to find it.After deciding on this camera, I called Olypus to find out what the most common user errors were that caused the camera to malfunction. The rep said it was usually hair or dust that would get caught between the water seals and the camera.I tested the camera in the pool and handed the camera to my 4 year old to take pictures. I wanted to make sure it didn't leak and could take any bumps my child would expose to the camera. My son didn't ever drop the camera or bump it, but the camera was easy enough for him to push the shutter button and the screen large enough for him to see what pictures he was taking. After testing in the pool, I felt I could take the camera on my trip.I was able to use the camera on 3 snorkeling trips. I used it on land on the beach for a few shots of a ghost crab and some sea lions. I used the camera's auto setting and the picture seemed a bit bright. For the underwater shots, I used the camera's underwater mode. The pictures were slighly dark, so days that didn't have bright sunlight in the water looked ok, but if there's heavy clouds, you may not be able to see anything in your pictures unless the objects are very close. You may be better off using the auto setting and then color correcting the pictures on your computer for underwater pictures-- but I haven't had a chance to test this out.I recharged the battery to the fullest after every trip. Before closing up the camera's side, I made sure that there wasn't anything (hair, sand, dust) on the seals and in the way of the seals. I always made sure the side's button was in the locked position before I got anywhere near water. After snorkeling trips, I rinsed the camera per the instructions and always let it air dry with the side open. I didn't want anything to happen to this camera during this once in a lifetime trip.On my 4th snorkeling trip, I took a few pictures then my camera turned off. I wasn't able to get the camera to come back on during that trip. When I got back on the boat, I tried recharging the battery because there was no other indication that something else was wrong after taking out the battery and visual camera inspection. When I went back to check on my camera after a couple of hours, I noticed condensation inside the screen. I tried turning on the camera and it still didn't work.I had read other people were able to air out their cameras and it worked later. I left the camera's side door open for a full day to dry and took out the battery. I did not try to charge it during this time because another tourist said that electrical currents could make it worse, especially since it leaked with salt water. One day of air drying and still no luck. I tried every day there after to air dry and turn it on, but it didn't work for the rest of my trip. Which is too bad because I missed out on sharks, manta rays, and penguins.When I arrived home, I turned on the camera and it actually came on for one second then turned itself off. I wasn't able to get the camera to stay on. I tried submitted an online warrant request, but the website didn't work correctly. I called Olympus customer service and she said sometimes the website's online form didn't work correctly. The rep was very nice and polite. I explained what happened and she directed me to a link to print out a form. She gave me a case number and told me to put it on the form when I filled it out. I mailed the camera with the form, a copy of the warranty that came in the original Olympus box, battery, and cables. I received the camera in less than 2 weeks! Wow! They mailed it back via UPS and the box was smashed, opened, taped, and had holes in the box. I was very concerned that the camera was damaged from UPS. I was able to turn on the camera, but haven't had a chance to really test it since I just received the camera yesterday. The paperwork included with my camera said they replaced the circuit board and screen. I am thoroughly impressed with the customer service. I had an excellent experience with Olympus and feel bad for the others that had poor experience.I would give Olympus a 5 star for customer service and a 4.0 star for the actual functionality and utility of the camera. I notched down the 1 star because the camera's pre-set settings for underwater and sunny day seems to be slightly off on exposure, and the camera leaked during the trip. If I had purchased one of those $300 cameras, the exposure issue would have knocked off more than a star, but given the cost of this Olympus, I'm not going to be that picky. Overall, the camera does it's job. Yes, there was the leakage issue and I wished that it didn't happen (I'm still bummed about the missed pictures), but I was able to get some pictures at the beginning of my trip and there was virtually no hassle with getting it repaired.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "BigAzzKiwi", "ReviewID": "R11ESTXUIEXDON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

Fits easily in the pocket and feels solid in the hand.  Takes moderate abuse well.  Works well in wet environments.  Simple to use point and shoot automatic functions, with enough manual settings to satisfy most users.  Modest, but acceptable zoom for most situations.  A good bargain when on sale.  Fixed lens doesn't drain the batteries like cameras that retract and extend with every start up.  LCD screen is bright and the menu functions are not overly complicated.  Basic camera functions are fairly intuitive.  The macro function is very good and the camera can take good photos at extremely close range (less than an inch) in super macro mode.Cons: not the best picture quality in it's class, struggles a bit in challenging light conditions.  Not the best performer in it's class or price range, but is capable of taking good photos in good light.  Shutter button is small and hard to use for those with large fingers.  Battery/SD card door is a bit flimsy and is the weak part of the overall design - use care here.  Auto focus can be a bit slow and will occasionally lock on the wrong target.  The flash is limited and generally ineffective, but this is not uncommon in this price range.  A steady hand is needed in low light conditions.  Not the fastest start up time (~ 4 seconds) but acceptable.  Battery capacity is limited but typical: around 150-175 shots per charge, depending upon usage.  Users should consider carrying a spare battery.Conclusion: I use mine for fishing, when a quick point and shoot, durability and waterproofing override picture quality limitations.  Not the best cameras for taking high quality portraits, but its rugged build, overall dependable performance and compact simple design make up for it's shortcomings.  A good deal if you can get one on sale.  A great backup camera to keep in the car, or for use by the kids.  If you are looking for a pure waterproof camera for underwater use, I would look else where.  But if you need a durable point and shoot that can tolerate a little moisture and abuse, you can't go to wrong with the TG-310.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lasted one trip", "Author": "Heidi Barbrick", "ReviewID": "RDM65VMAUI2YT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this camera two years ago for a trip to Cuba.

After our last trip to the beach, I went to rinse it off in the sink under running water and forgot to close the battery door!  I realized it instantly and pulled it out of the water.  It was too late, however.  When I tried using the camera I could hear the motor turn on but the screen wouldn't come on.  It WAS taking pictures, though, because the flash would go off and when I put the memory card into another camera, I could see the picture I just took.  I called Olympus Tech support and they told me that if the camera had a chance to dry out, it may work.  I decided to give it try before sending it to them for an $80.00 fix.  When I plugged the camera into the wall to charge the battery, condensation would appear on the screen.  I realized that was helping to draw the water out.  Since I have 3 batteries, I charged all three and continued to let the camera air dry in a dry place.  After 5 days, the camera WORKED PERFECTLY once again!!  It's like it never even happened!  This really lives up to its \"TOUGH\" name!The reason I give it 4 stars is because the pictures are ok.  They're not the greatest, but for the money, this camera serves the purpose that we bought it for--allowing my son to take it with us on water outings.  I also have a Canon Powershot D10 which is waterproof, but was $300.00.  The pictures are much better, but for a greater price.  It is true that the battery doesn't last long, but they're cheap enough that I bought two extras and always have them ready.  The only feature my son doesn't care for is that when you're taking video, you can't zoom in or get farther away.  You have to do that before starting your video.Finally, the features of the camera are awesome.  After some practice, you can take beautiful panoramic pictures.  You can also take pictures that look like drawings, or distort the picture like you're in a fishbowl, just to name a few.  The underwater mode takes some pretty neat snorkeling pictures.I recommend this camera as an alternative to buying a disposable waterproof camera to use on water outings.

Then, while snorkeling on a reef, the camera stopped working.

There was no open compartment, and nothing was in the way. It was just a malfunction of the sensor, but it would not allow the camera to operate, even on dry land.Obviously, we couldn't fix it while on vacation.

Stick the camera into the rice while recharging--I think it is a characteristic of this camera that if it's opened in a warm, humid environment, and then exposed to cooler temperatures when in use (say, when splashed with cold river water while canoeing), it will develop condensation inside.In any case, on a repeat of the kayaking trip that caused the first camera to mist up badly, the replacement item stayed watertight. So apparently it is a waterproof camera after all... unless you're unlucky enough to get one that isn't waterproof. That leaves the issue that it's still a fairly mediocre point-and-shoot camera. It starts up and responds slowly (don't expect to get candid shots with it), the auto-exposure is easily fooled by haze in the air, glare off water, or (apparently, when trying to shoot twisty-road video on the motorcycle) hot asphalt pavement, which shows up a blinding white (oddly enough, asphalt comes out dark gray when it's cool--is the camera seeing into the infrared?). It desperately needs a polarizing filter for any kind of around-the-water use, but none are made (time for ductape and cheap sunglasses, I guess).So, overall, a pretty ordinary point-and-shoot with that can be waterproof if you're careful. I upgraded the review to three stars on this basis.--- my original review ollows ---If it were truly waterproof, this would be a... fairly ordinary point-and-shoot digital camera, a bit slow to boot, a bit slow to record an image, a bit awkward to zoom (the buttons are hard to work and it tends to overshoot), a bit clumsy to change settings (you have to go through a lot of button presses to change things that would be a quick turn of a knob on another camera), and a bit less picture quality than you'd expect from 14 megapixels and 780p. But, it would be worth it to get a ruggedized, waterproof camera in this price range.Alas, this camera isn't waterproof. It's not even weatherproof, in the sense that it can't even tolerate the splashing that occurs during a canoe trip on a class 1 river (class 1 is one notch up from dead calm, for those not into whitewater terminology). Twenty minutes into its first use in the boat, the display, flash and (most important) lens window were fogging up on the inside. Two days later they are still fogged.The camera shop where I bought this item (I'd intended to buy in on Amazon, but they offered to match price) says it's 6-to-8 weeks to fix it... assuming Olympus will fix the thing (my past experience with the Olympus warranty department is that they view any problem as proof that you must have violated the terms of the warranty in some way). So much for capturing summer fun in the water... not that I'm going to trust it when it comes back, anyway. Once bitten twice shy and all that. Back to the disposable waterproof film cameras, I guess... they don't take movies and you have to wait for prints, but at least they usually don't leak.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Average Camera that is not EFFICTIVELY waterproof", "Author": "G. Bennett", "ReviewID": "RWTO1H0PT9O28", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to record a snorkeling vacation in HI.  I read all the reviews, including the cautions about the need to insure a clean seal, and thought I could be careful enough.  Wrong in spades.The camera worked well enough on land.  I used it several times in both still and video with acceptable, if not great results.  During our first snorkel it worked pretty well.  I got some videos and stills that were serviceable, but again not great.  I did not open the camera until I was back at the condo.  I rinsed and dried it before opening.  Then I cleaned the seal carefully with dry cotton swabs.  I allowed everything to air dry completely while open, then again went over the seal area with a microfiber cloth to remove any lingering debris or dust.  It worked fine.  The next snorkel trip I got three stills and it died.  When I got back there was water inside (salt, of course).  The camera is totally dead.If you want a waterproof, this one WILL die sooner or later, and most likely sooner, especially if you open and close the case during non-water usage.As a camera, the unit is just acceptable.  The color is good but the exposure settings seem off.  You cannot both zoom AND have audio in video mode.  One or the other.  On the good side, I liked the interface.  Easy to understand and change settings.Overall, this is a poor choice for just about any purpose.  The shock resistance feature is about the only reason I can think of to buy it.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wasn't that great..", "Author": "Brit", "ReviewID": "R3530PC27ULZ63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a X-Mas present.

Even when the people were standing completely still the pictures weren't clear when blown up on the computer. I returned it and got a different camera that seems to be working a lot better.
