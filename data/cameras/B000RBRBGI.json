Put it away for 5 years and forgot about it switched to digital. Found it again. Was so excited just thinking about the great pictures I had that I decided to dump my expensive digital and go back to the old school. Haven't regretted it since. I take alot of action shots. Cheer, jet sking etc. A pictures I have from years ago w/this camera is my husband doing a submarine on a stand up jet ski. They dive under front end first and completely submerge the ski I could never catch the full sequence w/dig let alone 1 good shot. Catch all steps now first time out w/it.

The only thing was it was a different camera then the one I had ordered. The reason I had ordered the first camera was because it came with a neck strap which I needed because this was to be used as a prop in a dance so I was a little disappointed when I didn't get what I ordered. We had to make our own strap. I did appreciate the company for there  service.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full-Automatic 35 mm autofocus lens-shutter camera with built in\n38-105 mm Zoom lens.  35mm standard DX coded film (24 x 36 mm)\nPassive autofocus system with focus lock.
