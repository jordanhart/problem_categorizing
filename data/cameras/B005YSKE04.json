The cam video is ok, I had to increase the brightness to see images clear through the day. As soon as night falls the camera is useless!!! It would be much better with IR. The other issue is when the power flickers off the cam will sometimes default to a full lock to the right. No matter what it will not return to my preset home position. I have to physically move the lens to the center position.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent camera with the ability to pan and tilt", "Author": "Jeremy B. Brown", "ReviewID": "RJ9HSGSDLEZAE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Decent little camera - I've got two.  I only wish it had a zoom, but it works well and syncs up quickly with your home wi-fi.  Nice to be able to access it from a computer or a smart phone, as well as manipulate it!  I only wish they were cheaper!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005YSKE04"}}
