{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Compact Camera", "Author": "N. Palmer", "ReviewID": "R19KCTIDDEW8Z2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a trip that I was taking in December.  I shopped around and was originally favoring the Cannon A75 which has received numerous excellent reviews.  What drew me to this one was a very small size, great body design, and the fact that it was 4.1 MP whereas the Cannon was only 3.2 MP.  The biggest problem I had when trying to convince myself to purchase this camera was the lack of online reviews.As previously stated in another customer's review, the body design is great.  The back of the camera has a rubberlike texture which feels great when snapping shots.  The menus are very easy to use, and very important to myself, the instruction manual is written in such a way that it is very easy to lean how to use all of the features on your new toy!  Huge plus for me, is the battery.  This camera uses a small rechargeable battery, not regular AA or AAA.  This battery holds charge for a good amount of time and was a major plus for me, especially considering all of the reviews complaining about how others cameras drain batteries at a very rapid pace.Probably the biggest reason I bought this camera is the panorama mode.  Many cameras have this feature, but the way that it works on this particular camera is absolutely amazing, with each subsequent shot becoming \"transparent\" allowing you to line up the next shot in the panorama.  They look great, I have one posted on this page.All in all, I really like this camera.  I have posted some shots that are very basic, but allow others to see what this small camera can do!  The small things make this camera really cool.  I took a vertical shot where I turned the camera vertically and snapped the picture.  The sensor in the camera recognized this and stored the photo in the correct orientation in its memory.  My friend who purchased a 3.2 MP Nikon turned to me and said, \"I wish my camera did that...\"", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera & Easy to Use", "Author": "F.

I have a 35mm Nikon and wanted a smaller camera to carry around for on the spot picture taking.  Decided to go digital.  The picture quality on this cameria is clear and crisp.  I especially like the Adaptive Lighting feature where the camera balances the lighting across the whole picture.It has great video capabilities with smooth streaming.  The remove red eye feature is also a plus and works well.The camera is very easy to use with an intuitive menu system.  Finally, I really like the look a feel with the silver face and rubberized back.  I would definitely recommend this camera.  It was definitely the best buy for the quality and price.", "Date": "November 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Almost my best friend :)", "Author": "Tiina", "ReviewID": "RSACY66ZEZXWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a month now and I've had so much fun with it.The first great thing about it was the price, I got it for a very reasonable price of 199 euros - my package included the leather pouch and one 128 Mb SD-card.I've had HP products before so I knew I could expect high quality combined with easy usability. Pictures turn out very nice as I like to have the Adaptive Lighting option on all the time. I've taken some beautifully artistic black and white and sepia photos as well. The camera really is good for every day use, from quick snapshots in the park to detailed still-life pics with a tripod, for instance.The only thing not so great is the sound quality, but if I wanted to take video clips I'd buy a proper video camera anyway.And as the camera is small and light, I can have it with me all the time. I've had more use of it already than of my traditional SLR camera that I bought three years ago!(If I understood correctly, one of the previous reviewers had got a virus on his/her camera. Well, one can't really blame that on the camera since the bug definitely came from somewhere else. That's just the price you pay for being careless yourself.

The battery lasts a long time.  It is quick to start up and take pictures.  I really like the way it shows you the last part of your last picture on the side of the screen so you can position you camera perfectly for great panorama shots.  The image advice feature is making me an expert by telling me how to improve almost any shot.  It is like having the manual built in to the camera.  I have printed a lot of the pictures and some of my friends have said that they wished their cameras  could take pictures as good as mine.  (Their new cameras cost more than twice as much)I am pretty happy.", "Date": "January 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Small, Stylish, simple...", "Author": "Gabriel R.

I'm so enamoured of my new camera that my husband is starting to wonder.I previously liked my refurbished HP Photosmart 635 2.1 MP because the menus were so easy to use and the photos were fine for 2.1.  Our daughter wanted an inexpensive digital camera which was my excuse to upgrade to something smaller.  I finally opted for another HP and purchased the R607 from Amazon (great price and free shipping) and I love this little thing.  It's very small (maybe about the size of a slim pack of cigarettes?) but feels great to hold (well designed rubbery material on the back) and it's packed full of features.  The menus are still incredibly easy to use right off the bat, although there are many settings which can be customized to maximize the quality of different types of shots.  The rechargeable lithium battery life is excellent, AND it's replaceable with the new CP-1 disposable from Duracell if you're going where you won't be able to recharge!  Takes SD or MMC but in a flash-card emergency, the built-in 16MB becomes available as a backup.  As for quality, I took several close-up shots of my favorite Magnolia Stellata in full bloom this spring, and I thought they were absolutely stunning.  The compact owner's manual is full of information about using the many different settings to get the most from your shots - I'll have to get around to doing that some day, but in the meantime, I'm just having fun.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!!!!!", "Author": "Mr. Techno", "ReviewID": "RG7XU8F8PD91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera- and I am amazed. I was hesitent about buying something other than Olympus- a name brand I could trust (I previously owned a D-390) but I am impressed by the quality of this camera. The pictures are sharp and crisp and HPs adaptive lighting will brighten the dark areas of the picture.Its very portable and it only took me 2 1/2 seconds for it to completly turn on and take a picture.

(I purchased one of the limited edition 'Gwen Stefani - Harajuku Lovers' cameras, but that doesn't make much of a difference) I'm very pleased with it but there are a few things that miff me.For one, even in medium light, sometimes it will take very long to take a picture if you're not using flash.  Sometimes you have to hold your hand/arm/body very, very still - usually someone would buy a tripod for this, but it even happens when simply doing a quick shot of a few friends on an outing or something. I practice holding my breath and keeping very still when taking pictures with this camera. (And sometimes it's awkward when someone poses for the camera and they have to stay still for 10-15 or even 20 seconds.)The audio quality of the video mode is absolutely horrible. All you hear is loud static. It's very hard to capture any sound at all and when you do it's nearly drowned out by the static.But there are many good things about this camera as well. First of all, the design. Although it has a small screen, it's no big deal. It's tiny enough to take anywhere with you but not fragile.There are different macro settings which can produce gorgeous pictures with lots of detail. It has 'Image Advice' - a little notification thing that pops up every once in a while to tell you how you might improve a picture.There are many different modes - sunset, portrait, beach, snow... there's even a panoramic mode that allows you to take large, wide pictures of landscapes or other things like that. It has different colours; B&W; and Sepia. You can adjust the hue and sharpness and exposure and all sorts of things. There is red-eye removal right on the menu and an automatic printing function - select the number of prints you want on your camera and hook it up to a special HP printer and you get professional pictures right from your camera.It has an InstantShare feature as well, which, when set up, allows you to send your pictures off to different people on your contact list immediately when you hook up your camera to your computer.So, for what it is, it's a spectacular camera - if you can settle with it's drawbacks. A tiny screen isn't much of a deal, right? I thoroughly enjoy using this camera and I'm going to continue using it for a long time to come.", "Date": "December 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for it's price and size!", "Author": "Vicki Bautista \"Troyster\"", "ReviewID": "R1ACRIY7YGVKR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first camera I've owned and I wanted one to take pictures of my friends at school as well as scenery. Due to the camera's compact size I can carry with me everywhere I go. It has many options but I usually keep it on auto and I get great results. The main standout point for me was the HP Adaptive Light Tech. feature. It is made to bring faces out of shadows and details out of backgrounds which makes the picture look 100 times better. I put one of my images of Lake Dixon in the customer images section if you want to see just how good these pictures turn out.

I'm not the kind of person that takes pictures all the time, but enjoy taking pictures during trips and family/friends reunions. What decided me to buy the R607 were its low price (very cheap in comparison with similar cameras at the time) and my previous experience with HP products (I own a HP desktop, a HP laptop, a HP PDA...).Regarding to this camera, it takes excellent pictures. I love the panorama function for taking landscape photos. 4MP is more than enough for a non-professional photographer. It has a lot of functions that I didn't use too often, but many could find useful. It can fit a cheap, very compatible SD memory card to improve its capacity.Nevertheless, it has some downsides. First of all, the LCD display is quite small. You can get used to it, but since newer cameras come with larger displays, you can be tempted to go that way instead. The software has given me some headaches lately, but I suspect I could fix the bugs reinstalling it from the beginning.  And the battery endurance has started to show some shortfall, but I think its normal after 3+ years of continued use.Overall I'm very satisfied with the camera's performance. Now its time for me to buy a new one, and I'll stick to HP for that.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Disappointing software and support", "Author": "S. K.

We have gone round and round with  HP tech support and still have not managed to install the camera software into our computer. (We own other brands of digital cameras, all installed without a hitch.)First of all, the HP software is 170 Mega-bytes large. Talk about bloat-ware! Why does it take such a huge program to manage a camera?Secondly, HP knows about the software problem. A \"fix\" is posted on HP.com. After downloading all 170MB of it, it still failed to install.  We contacted HP tech support through chat sessions, their suggestions all failed.

Unfortunately I was careless and dropped it in water. In searching for a replacement, I saw that this camera was considered to be just as good and it was considerably cheaper. I figured since I was going to be careless with my camerea maybe I should buy the cheaper one, especially if it was supposed to be as good. What a MISTAKE. First off, this camera is a little bit bigger both in depth and width than the Optio. It just doesn't have the same sleekness. Secondly, the picture quality is definitely not as good. Every other picture I take is out of focus. I just want a simple point and shoot camera, one that can focus without having to mess with things...this isn't doing the trick. Now its been doing this weird thing where every picture I take has lines running through it (looks almost like the picture is ribbed). Its VERY annoying. I have such buyers remorse. I really wish I hadn't have tried to save money and had just bought the Optio.

I had to reset my F-stop, sharpness and ISO every time. Ridiculous!!!The display is way too small to see much, but I guess the camera in general is pretty small.I guess if you want a simple digital camera for sharing photos by email, this is the one to get.

I found out it thinks it has a virus if you have movies with pictures!  And will just delete everything!  I have not used the movie function since as it uses too much memory anyways.  I have had okay luck since then but it still is only worth its money!  I had a cannon 5.1 megapixel with 5 normal zoom and 5 digital and it was great but it was also costly and I couldn't afford the bill at the time so I returned it for this one.  And I can tell a difference, better price, better camera.  But if you look  some are worse than this one but cost more.
