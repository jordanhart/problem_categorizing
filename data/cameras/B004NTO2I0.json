{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good travel camera", "Author": "jimbo92107", "ReviewID": "R355RUCLYUA8MH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent little camera for travelers. Bought this for an upcoming trip, and I've been testing it for the last few days on walks around a local lake. One day I took about 150 shots, and the battery was starting to wear down. No way this will shoot 200 without a recharge, which takes a couple hours. Realistically tho, how often do you shoot more than 100 shots in one day?On the other hand, this is the first camera I've owned that makes me look like I'm not a terrible photographer. The Intelligent Auto mode is everything a point-and-shoot idiot could wish for. It focuses quickly, sets all the settings, and all you do is shoot. The Lumix sensor gets the colors just about right, with a little kick to make the world look just a bit more vivid. It's also fun to fiddle with the focus point, which you can pick by touching a spot on the viewer.28 \"Scene Modes\" are available in groups of four, but you probably won't use more than a few. I wish I could rearrange the order of the Scene Modes so my favorites were in front. I also wish Panasonic's PhotoFunStudio 6.0 software didn't crash every time I try to offload photos to my PC, but I'm sure that bug will be fixed fairly soon. Meanwhile I copy photos using Windows Explorer to see the camera's SD card as a folder. Drag and Drop will do for now.The touch screen has decent contrast, but could be brighter in daylight (as could all LCD's). In Playback Mode you can slide your finger left or right to go to the next or previous photo. Some of the menu icons are really cryptic, so be sure to get the PDF of the full user's manual so you can decipher them. It also takes awhile to get used to how the menus work in different modes. I'm still puzzling over some of that.Best thing about this camera is the quick performance, excellent zoom and surprisingly good anti-shake. I could stand and snap a zoomed in stop sign from half a block away with no noticeable blurring. That's impressive in a camera this size. The worst knock is probably the battery, which is not going to get 200 shots, but will get more than most people will shoot in a day. An extra battery would come in handy, but at the moment (22 Mar) they aren't available.All in all it's hard to imagine a better pocket travel camera at this price point.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Smart Camera for the Photography-Challenged", "Author": "Emily M. Lee \"Emily\"", "ReviewID": "R30HY1WKRAURTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a family member who wanted a camera that would be easy to use.  And boy is this easy to use!  This is by far the most intelligent camera I have ever used in terms of the accuracy of its Auto mode.  Just point and click, and the camera will select the appropriate settings every time.  No more blurred action shots, and no more washed out flash pictures where the entire background is just black.  This camera selects the appropriate ISO setting for each shot - in milliseconds.  Very short shutter lag, I would say unheard of for a point and shoot.  The touch screen is very intuitive and simple to use, and I like the absence of \"confusing\" dials of settings that most point and shoot cameras have.One feature I like is instead of having to choose the shooting mode (i.e. Portrait/Landscape/Night Scene/etc.) the camera automatically detects which shooting mode it should use, and switches to that mode - again, in milliseconds.  This is easily the most user-friendly camera I have ever come across, and my grandmother is already delighted with it.To be clear, this camera is not for a photography enthusiast, as you really have almost zero control over the settings.  This camera is fantastic for the demographic it was designed for: those who want to be able to push a button and capture the moment every time.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Pocket Size Compact", "Author": "Tom Lathrop", "ReviewID": "R270PBXVCPJB0Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice little camera that I bought to capture high definition photos when I'm out and about and not carrying my Nikon DSLR. It doesn't do so well with real close up macros but it takes great photos overall and they are clear and fairly crisp. The files size is large (over 6 MB for the high setting). The battery life is definitely a problem and spare batteries are available but still expensive at the time of this review ($35-$50 range). It eats up battery power even when the camera is turned off. In bright sunlight the LCD screen is difficult to see. Operationally the camera is easy to use and turns out good photos.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "I found an OEM battery that works with Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27", "Author": "Slacker88", "ReviewID": "R32LO2EVSAWYEM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27 camera in May 2011.  I love this camera given the low price point.  It does have a few things that could use some improvement.  However, the biggest beef is the battery life.  Like most of the reviewers here, I did have problem with the battery not lasting long enough for the day (ran out of juice after less than 200 shots).  Thanks to the reviews here, I brought along an old Canon camera as a backup and did have to use it on two occasions during a Baltic cruise.I am happy to report that after some research on the web, I bought an OEM battery Wasabi Power Battery BTR-BCK7-JWP that works with Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27.  At $12 (plus shipping) from Amazon.com, it is rated at 1100 mAh and should last longer that the stock battery (rated at 680 mAh).  I did not take enough pictures (only 100+) to deplete this new battery, but the charge was still pretty full after that.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera except tiny little Problem!!", "Author": "Senthil K.

The flash is so close to the zoom lens, if you take a close up shot the shadow of the zoom lens spoils your left hand corner of your picture.It all dark at the left bottom corner.

Edward \"Barefootd\"", "ReviewID": "R2M9W6FUZXUCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been researching cameras for a couple of months.  I wanted easy to use, point & shoot, good low light shots(which has been difficult to find in a compact), a few manual options...not too many.  My list was finally narrowed down to three and I looked at and tried all three.  The FH-27 was my choice hands down! I was ready to order from Amazon when by chance I found that our local Costco carried them...with the bonus of an instant rebate as well!  So I got this camera at Costco a few weeks ago and then was fortunate to be able to take it on a weekend Model T tour to confirm its capabilities.  I didn't miss one shot!!  Very reliable, easy to focus, quick recovery, very good stabilization, very good indoor color, touch screen very easy to use after just a few times.  I took 500 pictures in three days touring in all types of light and all types of conditions.  And, if you've ever been in a Model T you know it's not a smooth ride so the stabilization had to be great...it is!!  Nearly every single pic was focused and had good color (enter operator error).  I charged the battery every night and had no down time from lack of a charge.  I did have to get used to the lens being nearer the end instead of the in the middle of the camera but one of the displays has grid lines so that was solved.  I highly recommend this camera for those of us who love taking good pics but not the desire to constantly set up or change a manual setting.  I've already had two friends try the camera and go and buy one...it's that user friendly!", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exellent camera but complex controls", "Author": "Erik Gordon Bainbridge \"Author, virtual world...", "ReviewID": "R1HVJEXM2LX8JS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only had this camera for two weeks, but it impressed me during that time.  I ended up returning it not because of any problem with the camera, but because my needs changed.  I should mention that although there were no problems with the camera, there was a problem with Amazon's fulfillment: I ordered a black Lumix but Amazon sent me a silver one instead.  Not a big deal, but worth noting. (It was sold by DiscountsJungle, but fulfillment was by Amazon.)I helped a friend set up a new Lumix DMC-FH25 at about the same time I bought my Lumix DMC-FH27, so I had an opportunity to compare them.  They are basically the same camera, with two major differences: the DMC-FH27 has a 3.0\" LCD and touch screen controls; the DMC-FH25 has a 2.7\" LCD and has physical controls on the camera body.  One other difference I noticed is that the DMC-FH27 offers an option for shooting 5x7\" pictures in average 3mb file size; the DMC-FH25 does not.I found the controls in both cameras unnecessarily complex, but this is probably for marketing purposes, so Panasonic can sell it as a versatile camera, even though most consumers will never use the vast majority of the features. I suspect that Panasonic is no worse than other manufacturers in this regard.  All of the point-and-shoots I've used (Nikon and Lumix) take such good pictures in automatic mode that most people will have little need of the other modes the cameras offer.The touch screen controls work well and to my surprise I preferred them to the physical controls on the DMC-FH25, but for most people, the DMC-FH25 will be much easier to use.  Several disadvantages to any touch screen on a camera: you'll have to recharge your battery more often, you may have problems if you install a protective screen on the LCD, and you're going to have fingerprints on the LCD.While I had the DMC-FH27, I compared it to two of my other cameras: Nikon Coolpix L20 and Nikon D60 DSLR.  The Lumix came out well in the comparison, roughly equal to the Coolpix and in one case, as good as the D60.I didn't have the DMC-FH27 long enough to run any meaningful and accurate tests of resolution, so my comparison test is only for color and image quality.  In general, the D60 unsurprisingly got the best pictures, but in one test, the Lumix was just as good.  In my other tests, I sometimes preferred the Lumix and and sometimes the Coolpix; it was equally divided between the two.My one major complaint about the Lumix was its flash, which was more overpowering than the Coolpix flash.  On the other hand, the zoom is much better on the Lumix.  It zooms out much wider than the Coolpix L20, and it automatically shoots in macro mode; I accidentally took a picture with the camera about an inch away from a magazine page, but the text in the photograph turned out impressively sharp.If you need a date stamp on your photos, you might not like this Lumix.  The date stamp the Lumix imprints on the photos is much fainter, barely readable, than the Coolpix L20, and in a format that doesn't make a lot of sense.  For example, for a photo taken on November 3, 2011 at 3:15pm, the barely readable imprint on the photo, which I had to blow up in Photoshop to read, shows \"PM 3:15 Nov/ 3/2011\".  If you need a legible date/time stamp on your photos, this is not the camera for you.  The imprint is too faint to be useful.Based on my experience with several Coolpix L20s and the experience of friends with various models of Lumix, I'd expect more reliability from the Lumix.  I've written a separate review about the Coolpix L20.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feature rich, affordable camera", "Author": "Ordinary guy", "ReviewID": "R3RF92BUU659Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a long time Canon fan I was seriously looking at the latest A series models as an upgrade to my current A590IS.  Then I came across this Lumix. The advanced features in a small affordable camera (along with Panasonics above average reliability) made it a must have.This is a really cool camera. It takes great stills indoors and out with a very quick startup and recovery between pictures. I was very interested in the HD video and am very satisfied with the video quality.  My 7 year old Dell P4 computer has no problem handling the HD Quicktime videos.Touchscreen, 8X optical in a small camera, 16 Mpix, Leica lens, and a host of other advanced feature make it a really great camera at a very good price.The only problem so far is the very pricey Panasonic battery that must be used in this Lumix. A spare battery is hard to find and cost a third as much as the camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally, a point and shoot that takes good indoor pictures at night", "Author": "kwb", "ReviewID": "R2Y7M90VR69LXR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first point and shoot digital for me that takes good indoor pictures at night most of the times.I've used many point-and-shoot in the past, but since digital camera age started, somehow I always had a problem taking decent pictures in a dark place e.g. inside a room at night. I used Olympus, Minolta, Cannon, Casio, and another Panasonic, and they all are good for outdoors to me, but whenever I took pictures indoors at night, like party and such, they all disappointed me. Some over-saturated, some strange color, some just simply too dark.Now, I have a DSLR, and I learned just enough to take passable pictures under the same situation, but really, DSLR is not for casual pictures as far as I'm concerned. Unless you always carry it around, which I don't because of the bulk, you miss too many moments. My kids are showing a gorgeous smile? I want to take out my camera, now!Anyway, back to this camera. It takes good pictures indoors at night, without me fiddling around with anything. Just select intelligent auto mode, and that's it. Even when it doesn't  work as good as it could, the pictures are still OK. I still haven't figured out under which condition it performs best, but this is a significant step forward as far as I'm concerned!Video quality is also good, but you cannot change the zooming while taking video. Also, sometimes you want to control the camera manually, and there's not too much you can do with this camera (different target audience). These are not serious problems for me, but problems sometimes, for which I subtract one star.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the casual photographer with a bent for gizmos!", "Author": "Kittokino", "ReviewID": "R3DEZVAPID8G3N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned a Lumix (DMC-ZS5) before and have been very satisfied with it. I bought this for my sister, though I did use it initially to test it out and I'm just as satisfied with the picture quality. It's nicely compact, well built and fairly good looking camera (black and silver looks conservative while the other ones look funkier!) Boot time is really really fast and so is the time it takes to capture a picture. Rest of the controls are typical Panasonic - no gripes with them. The flash is pretty powerful for its size. Being a fully auto mode camera, it will want to fire up the moment light is low, though you do have the option to turn it off. The other niceties are the touch auto-focus and a quick zoom button (E.Zoom - pressing it quickly zooms to max. so you can focus precisely.)It's the touch-screen display that's where this comes up a bit short. It's not very responsive (being a capacitive touch screen, it will need you to \"press\" to get your action registered) though adds to the techie quotient but feels a generation older. Besides, some of the icons on display doesn't convey the mode you are in (particularly if you are in Video mode.) The other shortcoming (know before purchase, which I assume can be fixed with a firmware update) is that you cannot zoom while shooting a video (it is locked to the state at which you started filming.) And the last issue is that while previewing the images, they wont rotate if you switch orientation of the camera, a silly thing that's not there in my other Lumix model as well.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touch Screen is Hard to Use", "Author": "GlowStarGI", "ReviewID": "R2F0UD4OTKPDW8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes great pictures and I was very happy with that part.

Pictures come out crisp and clean and transfer nicely to a computer. We love that it has a feature that you can take shots in black and white.Touch Screen, brilliant - actually has words to define the features instead of graphics that you never can remember what it means. Also gives you little helpful notes that run across the bottom part of the screen for instructions on what a feature does. It's really uber user friendly because I'm the type that is electronically challenged and can work this like a charm. First camera we've ever had that I can work easily.Stylus - camera comes with a little stylus that you can use instead of your finger and my husband ingeniously tied it to the end of the hand strap that is attached to the camera for easy use. I like that the camera sounds off a little music bell when a command is completely, and when you take a shot it makes a click sound like an old fashioned camera...love it.You can also choose to shoot in black/white, color, or sepa (which is a kind of muted pastel palet) cool.Camera comes in black, silver, and red.Camera is small but big enough to hold without dropping.You can attach the camera to a tri-pod for group shots.The screen is pretty large too and is bright enough to see even in a dark living room in the daytime too.Great camera.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touchscreen Menu Makes this Camera a Crapshoot", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R3RUQMAMYN4997", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Purchased this camera based on its superior optical system and the fact I had already owned a PanasonicLumix that was stolen.

The problem is the menu system and the touchscreen work together to make controlling the camera impossible.The layout of the menu system is incomprehensible. The touchscreen adds to the fun by being very touchy and so eager to lead you to an item it goes off at the slightest touch. Couple that with dozens of made up graphic symbols that are neither standard nor in any way related to what is done. In short if you have any need to adjust this camera I guarantee you will fail. You will be constantly bewildered by what is considered important and by the grouping of unrelated functions in a menu system that might as well be written in the language of Pictographs.
