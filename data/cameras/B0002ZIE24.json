{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Excellent Buy", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R16NPUV9MGAVT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera works quite well, and does what is says it does (senses movement and then blinks a red LED while swiveling back-and-forth), and is very low cost.  And it actually *does* look like a small, low-cost surveillance camera.  The only negative aspect is that you have to be relatively close to the \"camera\" (around ten feet in a lighted situation) to make it activate with normal (not exaggerated) body movements -- and it won't trigger at all in low light situations.  All-in-all though, a great buy for a device that may prevent a burglary of your home or apartment.", "Date": "November 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "works but feels fake.", "Author": "P.

I had to return the first unit, because the motion detector would not work.  Second unit doesn't always move when motion occurs.  Wife did not like the look of the unit.  On the second unit, one of the phillips screw's head was deformed and I could not use the screw.  I may have to return the second unit.  That's says it all.

It's mounted high up on a 10' wall and it looks pretty good (not phony) from the floor and I'm pretty impressed with the motion detector light and movement. It's cool. Plus there is a wire on the mounting plate that really makes this thing look hard-wired into the wall. I'd definitely recommend this camera but maybe not if it's going to be in an 8' ceiling. Someone may be able to spot that it's fake that close up.
