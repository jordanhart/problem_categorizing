{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Kodak Easyshare C530 5MP DC & Dock are perfect!", "Author": "J. Samuel", "ReviewID": "R6UQJD7FB1L5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for my sister who is currently visiting me for the summer back in June, so we've had almost a month to test it out. She had seen the camera priced ranging from $119USD-$139USD, and the dock at $127USD, so getting this combo package for less than $180 was a fantastic!The camera is extremely easy to use. Its simple features are perfect for anyone starting out in the world of digital cameras. Navigating through the menus does not even require you reading the manual; everything appears on the screen.Since the camera does not come with an external memory card, you must get one ASAP, as you can only take about 15-20 pictures on the lowest setting possible using the camera's internal memory. We took pictures using 3.1MP and I must say, they turned out very well. So we then switched to 5MP setting and of course the pictures were sharper & larger; thus better. The view screen is a good size, and so is the digital zoom compared to my own digital camera. My sister has also recorded MPEGs of my cat. Once again, extremely easy to navigate, record, and playback.The camera charges & prints from the Easyshare printer dock. The battery life is about 3 hours when fully charged, we've had no problems with the battery or the dock thus far. Everything you'll need ie. USB plugs, printer cartridge, cables, photo paper are all included in the package. Like I mentioned before, you'll need to get a memory card. We purchased a 512MB and on the 3.1MP setting, the camera says you should get over 500 pictures out of it.This is an excellent purchase for anyone who is just starting out or who is not looking for anything complicated--just point & click.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love my new digital Kodak EasyShare C530 5MP camera", "Author": "J. Hart \"Picture happy Nana\"", "ReviewID": "R2QLL8M36UGAVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera as a gift for myself for my birthday.  I took several pictures of friends when we went out to dinner.  One of my friends was very impressed with the photos that I sent to him.  He was amazed at the quality of the picture and the fact that it was taken with such a small camera.  The ease of using the camera, the amazing prints and the overall quality of the product is very satisfying to me.  My daughter has a camera that she paid a lot more for and, in my opinion, this camera takes as good a picture if not better.  I love the fact that I can take pictures, print them out without going to a store and waiting several days to get them back, and I can download them very easily into my computer (the program is very user friendly) and I can email them with a simple click of a button to family and friends.  I, for one, am very pleased and happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this product highly to any and all family, friends, and anyone who asks.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "E.

Boyer", "ReviewID": "RV1IJ33UQBIRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this bundle last week on Amazon, first the price ($170)was amazing and it arrived in only two days with standard shipping.  I was able to use the camera right out of the box, although after a few pictures I did need to put it on the printer dock to charge it but a couple hours later it was fully charged.  This is an awesome bundle, it even comes with a small pack of paper so you can start printing pictures right away, which I did and the printer is very easy to use just plug it in, put the camera on top, press the print button and you have a great picture a minute later.  This is my second digital camera and I am so impressed with it, this is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a camera with a higher number of megapixels, my old camera had 1.3, and I wanted to be able to take a picture with no delay in between the time you press the button and the time it actually takes the picture. If you have kids you defenitly don't want a delay.  I did purchase a memory card since the camera only holds about 11 or 12 pictures on it's internal memory. If you are looking for an easy to use camera with good picture quality and the ease of printing your pictures at home then this is the perfect camera & printer for you.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "As simple as digital gets !", "Author": "Stephen Baker", "ReviewID": "R3NX4UEUM6LFXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.  I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "GOOD  CAMERA", "Author": "Iwona Vasquez", "ReviewID": "R1U6AE0HTSZ44O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "VERY EASY TO USE.

Small, lightweight, and takes great pictures! My only two complaints, number one; the cartridge/paper kits are hard to come by locally, and when I can find them, they are outragiously high in price. Number two; I run an older windows 98 computer, and the software for windows 98 was not incuded. I had to download it, and after the download, it is complicated to set up, and had to contact tech support to find the name of a hidden driver file so I could locate it and install it. I do realize that windows 98 is becoming the system of the past, but there are many of these systems still out there.", "Date": "April 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easy Share", "Author": "L.

But if you want a small camera and printer for a good price, than this is good. It has a great feature that plugs into the computer and downloads pics.

We had to send the camera back twice during the first year for repairs after lengthy, tedious phone conversations with the company to assure them repeatedly that \"no, it has not been immersed in liquid\" and to go through a list of very obvious things to check for and eliminate reasons for it malfunctioning. The closure for the battery is now broken on the camera  - we gave up and got a Nikon, which we love. My sister had similar problems with her Kodak in a short time period as well. The printer has been very temperamental and has finally died completely.Good quality pictures, easy to use, but I'd recommend paying a bit more to get a product that will last longer and be more reliable.
