{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent image & product quality -- Software and manual need work", "Author": "Bacci", "ReviewID": "R1XTULBKS3K1UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to increase the security around my house, following recent cases of theft in the neighborhood. It's installed high up on the side wall of my house..***INSTALLATION***The first thing I noticed opening the box was the undetachable all-in-one cable (\"for your convenience\"!), thinking how on earth am I going to get this cable squid through the wall without drilling a hole the size of a small window. I thought about buying an additional PoE injector, running only a network cable through the wall and stuffing everything else in a weatherproof box next to the camera, but then came up with the idea to tape the various connectors on to the camera's network cable using electrical tape, one right behind the other. This solution kept the required hole size to slightly larger than the network cable connector, which I was able to drill with a big extra long bit and a normal power drill.Hard to understand why Levelone completely fails to provide any instructions on how to properly/easily install the hardware part, the manual does not even mention how to rotate the 2nd axis of the camera (which screw to loosen etc.)... this product is after all sold in retail. Anyway, I figured it out by myself and moved on to adding the anti-moist bag and fitting a 8GB SD card in the housing.After finishing up by stuffing the holes with silicone and mounting the camera to the wall, I hooked the camera up to my router using 2x 200mbit powerline network adapters to get the signal from bedroom to the router in my garage and connected the standard power adapter supplied with the camera.Setting up the camera on the software side was easy using the browser interface, but unfortunately only properly works on Internet Explorer (Windows)..***OPERATION / QUALITY***My goal was to set up two streams: one high quality, one for mobile devices.In dual stream mode, the high quality stream tops off at 720p.1/ High quality streamI'm not interested in opening Windows / Internet explorer or Levelone software in MS Windows every time I want to look through the camera.The solution is to set up a RTSP or HTTP stream which can be opened by any media center / player / ... like e.g. VLC.But again, Levelone fails to provide proper documentation: There is no mention (manual, website, ...) of the right camera paths to access the video streams via non-Levelone software. I was left to experiment and google.To save future users some time,I included the correct paths to access the FCS-5051 under this review.The image quality of the stream during daytime is excellent. During the night the quality is still surprisingly good and could be further enhanced with an IR illuminator.2/ Mobile streamThe IcamSecure app is entirely useless for most people, as it requires intermediary software to permanently run on some Windows PC rather than connect directly to the camera.The solution here is to use a 3rd party streaming app, or just use the phone's/tablet's browser.In my case (Iphone) the Safari browser can access the stream directly without the need for an app.3/ Events / Motion detectionIt takes a while to tweak the right sensitivity and treshold for the motion detection to work properly, i.e. avoid triggering by wind, rain, etc. but still catching all relevant events.Trigger zones can only be defined using rectangles.Once set up, it works very well.The movies recorded on the SD Card inside of the camera are only accessible through the camera's own web page via Internet Explorer.I don't understand why Levelone omitted the possibility to record movies directly to a NAS or PC via ftp/http/Samba/..., instead of only offering the option to do so for JPEG images. Most other Levelone camera's (including the indoor Levelone FCS-0030 camera I bought for less than 1/3 of the FCS-5051's price) offer this possibility...Hopefully Levelone will fix this issue in future Firmware releases..***CONCLUSION***This is an excellent quality camera with a high resolution for its price.There are some caveats:- Levelone provides very limited software, mobile and Mac/Linux users are left to fend for themselves- Hardware installation instructions are inadequate for a product sold in retail- Inability to write recorded movies (as opposed to .jpg images) directly to a computer or NAS.For the tech savvy, I can still highly recommend this camera because of its excellent build and image quality for the price..***HOW TO ACCESS CAMERA, fyi:H264 over RTSP:rtsp:(double slash)username:password@CameraIPaddress:554/h264MJPEG over http:h(double t)p:(double slash)username:password@CameraIPaddress:8008MJPG stream works in Safari browser on Ipad and Iphone.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, un-beatable service", "Author": "wheels10", "ReviewID": "R36Q7SCQYG0W57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the last couple years, I have installed 3 Panasonic (531A and 2-715A) cameras and 3 Level One 5051s cameras for both indoors and out.  The hardware build quality and durability of the 5051s is substantial, they are all metal (except for the sun shield) and have worked flawlessly through the rain, in the open, not under an eave.  The Panasonic cameras, although smaller and less conspicuous, are all plastic.The picture quality in day and especially night is outstanding, especially for the price.  Can't comment on the Level1 software as I use Blue Iris/Propective Software to manage the camera outputs from the different manufacturers.On service/support, one of the 5051s arrived out of focus, so I called Level1's customer support, spoke to technician, and in less than a couple minutes, he diagnosed that I would need to send in the camera.  Mailed it the next day and in less than the week, the camera was sent back fixed.  Very responsive support and fast repair turnaround.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0051BUC38"}}
