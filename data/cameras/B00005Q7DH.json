I needed to keep up with the times and send pictures of the wife & kids, dogs, new house, and roadtrips via e-mail to my family 2000 miles away. I own two Olympus 35mm cameras - so I stuck with a brand name I knew. Outstanding photo quality... up to size 8x10. It has a \"Quickplay\" video feature. The menu is fairly easy, so you won't spend to much wasted time trying to figure things out. I've read many reviews here complaining about the short battery life... newsflash people - ANY digital camera is going to do this. Invest in the rechargable batteries.  The ONLY problem I have with this camera is the zoom. The digital zoom simply increases the picture size... as to an optical zoom bringing you closer to the action.

Its features include a movie mode... something other 2 MP cameras don't really have. Alkaline batteries don't work well with any digital camera.  Buy the rechargable batteries.

It also offers some options pertaining to flash, picuture and movie quality, and more that I haven't even gotten to yet.  I would recommend with this camera that you also invest in the listed rechargeable batteries (standard AA's don't stand a chance for much use but most cameras are like this anyway), a larger memory card (I got a 128 mb (simpletech) that can hold 92 SUPERHIGH quality pics), a card reader which makes it easier to transfer high quality pics to and from the computer, through the memory card, for editing, and Adobe Photoshop Elements 1.0, a user-friendly editing software.

While it does not have optical zoom, the digital zoom is better than most digicams I have used -- including my own Canon S100 \"digital elph.\"  The picture quality is simply superb and seals Olympus's reputation for producing some of the finest-quality digital cameras in the world.  The operations are all easy to learn, esp. if you have used an Olympus analog before.The only gripe is battery life, which is ridiculously short on regular alkalines.  (On the other hand, it's nice to have a digicam that takes AAs.)  Be sure to get lithium rechargeable batteries for this camera.  They are more expensive, but they provide much longer battery life (so you can take the camera out on a day trip without hauling 10 pairs of alkalines) and can be recharged.Once you get the batteries straightened out, this is simply the best-value digital camera on the market.
