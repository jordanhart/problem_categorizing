I don't have any squigglys or jaggys even though I was forced to run a couple of them past some power wires.  I was a bit concerned because they are a bit thin but they still do the job well.One thing to note:  If you plan on splitting this cable like you might split a typical Siamese Coax you will be out of luck.  These are \"formed\" into one cable and can't be split.I will buy these again if needed.  They are a great value for cheap cables.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellant Product !!", "Author": "Brian W.
