{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Little System for the Price", "Author": "MDHZ", "ReviewID": "R3FYCFBTPIL49L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this system through \"USA Security Store\" (through Amazon), the items came quickly and well packed.  The instructions to set up the system was pretty basic, but understandable.  The operation of the DVR was a little cryptic, but again, simple enough to muddle through.Installation of the system was straight forward.  You simply mount the camera mounts to the side of your house, then mount the camera, then plug the cables (which lead back to the central unit(s).  There are two main units that come with with this system: the DVR and the Power Converter (see the posted pictures).  I have sliding on house, so a quick trip to Home Depot to get a siding remove was a trip well spent.I had a few installation questions and the seller was quick to respond with help.  When it seemed that I could have had a broken part, they were quick to offer a replacement.  It turned out that the weather hood was just shifted (so it looked like the camera had a problem).  (They figured that out too, bravo!)The system has stood up well over several months of use - including serious snow and rain in our area.There are two big conveniences that I like - #1, the night vision is pretty cool.  The only thing I would caution is that condensation can obscure the picture a bit.  As a whole the system does a good job at night.  #2, the online viewing is a really nice feature - so you don't have turn on the TV to see what's going on outside.  I'll post a picture so you can see it.The only thing that I would caution is that the video quality could be a bit better.  Its definitely enough to make out faces and most details.  But if you're looking for HD, this isn't it.  Still, the main part is that I got all the wiring run, so an upgrade in the future should be much simpler.All in all, I'm happy with this system - I'm glad it came with everything included (no need to figure out what I might/might not need).  The seller was helpful and I'd buy from them again.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Great Service", "Author": "Kevin Guru", "ReviewID": "R104RFJWGQ2CR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second of these units I have purchased. The ease of setup and the performance for the price is fantastic.  I love being able to access off any smartphone or pc that I am on.  And find the alarm functions of the cameras outstanding.  I highly reccomend this product!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I would try a different Brand next time", "Author": "LordMetalZ28", "ReviewID": "R1WUQK48FZCFKH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When reading the manual everything seems very \"plug and play\" but once you actually get into the settings of your DVR you'll soon notice that the manual doesn't match the machine much if at all. (Apparently, the same manual is stuffed in with about 12-14 different DVR models from this company.) Customer Support is excellent and follow through is on par but they could certainly reduce their call volume if the manuals were better written or at least written for the exact model of DVR they are pairing it with.Total internet setup time with poor manual: 10 days!Cameras= Not the best quality i am sure! at first i was really disappointed when i saw the videos i expected poor quality but not that poor.These cameras are advertised as sony cameras which i highly doubt.The sony camera advertisment is the selling point that put me over the edge on this system but it is not the case at all. After a few months of looking at gas station and bank camera screens i noticed there all kinda the same the more expensive quality having a crisper image but making somebody out in the distance is impossible on any camera unless it zooms it seems.Cords= The absolute cheapest bottom of the barrel cords i have ever worked with. Do your self a favor and invest in the good quality cords you will be glad you did. These cords where very fragile and if you set them down for a second they would tangle  BADLY!!!!!!! forget about splitting the two wires apart easily for a remote power distribution location. your gonna have to do some cutting of sleeves because of course they do not slide down the cord easily it insists on being a huge deal!! also i would suggest learning how to wire your own end connections so you do not have to drill 3/8 holes in your house for a tiny cord( learned the hard way).Power box= Was actually a really nice piece. came with 8 pigtails and on and off switch. could have made the power supply cord longer but that,s not a big deal for the price of the systemDvr= This Dvr is terrible it does the job but barley.  This is what made me wish i went with a different system. You get about a week storage of video files with all 8 channels hooked up (not bad) The remote is useless the first thing you should do is throw that in the garbage and save your battery,s. Second forget the Dvr even has buttons on the face of it because as you guessed they do not work either. There are even options inside the Dvr hard drive that does not work either. all in all a pretty poor design i am just greatful it even works at all. this is the first piece i am upgrading and recommend you upgrade if you end up purchasing this system.The only good thing about this Dvr is the ability to send the video feed to a monitor and your  TV,s at the same time.I have since split the video feeds and am able to view the feed on all TV,s and computers in the house.Hardware= As i said before the remote is useless. The camera mounting hardware is pretty cheap as well and stripped out on me a couple times thankfully i am a mechanic/Tech and can repair most anything. It does not come with any needed cords to connect it to your TV,s monitors or internet so be prepared to buy those on your own.In closing i cannot recommend this system on the basis of its performance at all. I wish i would have went with a Qsee or night owl personally. The only reason i gave it the stars i gave it was because the customer service was amazing. i was on the phone with them all 10 days for hours trying to get it connected to the web for mobile viewing and they where with me the entire time and did everything in there power to fix the situation. on the customer service basis i highly recommend it. final verdict is if i could do it over i would do a different system and i recommend you do the same", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004TLW3B0"}}
