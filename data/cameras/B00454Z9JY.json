{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon D7000 kit", "Author": "MadDrD", "ReviewID": "R323V6FRLYV8OH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first foray into DSLR.  I had been a Minolta SLR user for many years and love the responsiveness and flexibility of SLRs and manual cameras.  I have been using a Kodak Easyshare for many years because it's relatively small, easy to use, and is digital.  But I lost many good shots because these kinds of cameras take f-o-r-e-v-e-r for the shutter to operate.  I craved the speed of the SLR and the flexibility of the manual settings.  And I didn't want to use film.The D7000 is a phenomenal camera and definitely tics all the boxes for me.  Whilst I'm getting used to the DSLR options, I can use the auto features and get some fantastic shots.  As I'm learning more about the camera's features, I am having fun switching to more control over shutter speed and aperture.  Plus, I can take many pictures in a few seconds and not lose a shot.  I can pick the best of the batch, and shooting RAW gives me lots of data to work with.  I think it will be some time before I have good mastery over this camera, but I am very glad I spent the money on it.This kit was a great deal.  It's got an incredibly flexible lens, and the VR (Vibration Reduction) aspect makes for some very clear shots, even with my slightly shaky hands.  The large memory card is good to keep you going for quite some time.  I was saving RAW and fine JPEG and the card was good for over 500 pictures.  The camera bag is a good starter bag, and I'll probably use it for general picture taking, though I just purchased a Lowe camera pack for longer photo sessions.  The other accessories in the kit are nice to have (e.g., UV filter, lens cleaner, memory card reader) were all nice to have from the start without worrying about whether I forgot something important if I purchased things separately.  I also got a spare battery and a wireless remote, both of which came in very handy recently for a family reunion.Cameta Camera, who sells the kit, shipped the product quickly and got it to the hinterlands of Western Washington state in time for a family reunion.  I am very pleased with this kit, the camera and lens, and Cameta's service.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7000 plus 18-200mm VRII is an Excellent combination.", "Author": "Newman Q", "ReviewID": "RX1X357BLWSLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon D7000 body plus 18-200mm lens is a great combination. Nikon D7000 Body is well known and popular since it's been announced. The Nikkor DX 18-200mm VR II is an 11.1 times super-zoom lens built for Nikon DX format DSLRs in July 2009. The lens is good for most situations I met, especially for trips. I'm satisfied with it.It took around 13 days to be received and without free mailing for such a $2,000 value purchase. These are the 2 things negative.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loving it", "Author": "AC", "ReviewID": "R2VKJ7TCZU4P6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Am big fan of Nikon and Previous I had a D5000.
