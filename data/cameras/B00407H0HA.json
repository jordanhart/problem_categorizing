{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy to Use Functional Camera", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3JM5EL8JU1XDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera works fine for me.  I bought the camera at a local department store before reading the reviews.  The camera was on sale for $20 and so far I'm happy with it.  I needed an inexpensive camera that was easy to carry in my shirt pocket and that I didn't have to worry too much about being so careful with it.  I needed it for documentation of apartment repairs, tenant isssues and general photo taking.  I have a $200 Samsung that I was always worrying about bumping it, dropping it and being careful where I set it.The Pros:  After reading all the negative reviews, I tested the Vivitar 7022 in just about every mode it offered with no adverse problems.  Picture quality was good, video quality was pretty good, it has almost all the features as my $200 Samsung does, except optical zoom.  The 4x digital zoom was a little grainy but acceptable for the type of photos I will take.  The Macro mode was good at taking pics of printed documents.  The on-screen icons can be easily turned off but you will need the owners manual to reveal these fetures.  It turns on quickly and is ready to use in just a few seconds as compared to my Samsung which has a longer boot time.  I'm only using a 512 MB SD Card and with about 100 pics and 4 videos, all taken with the highest quality image settings, it still had about half the memory left on the card.The Cons:  It does deplete alkaline batteries quickly using the flash.  I bought a set of 900 mAH NiMH rechargeable AAA Hi-Capacity batteries for about $8 and I got over 80 flash pics, about 4 short videos and spending a lot of time going through each mode changing settings and experimenting and still didn't deplete the batteries.  If you buy rechargeable batteries,  get the 900 or higher mAh rated NiMH batteries, I used some 350 mAh Ni-CAD rechargeables that I had and only got about 3 dozen pics w/flash.  The view screen is small and a bit grainy.  In the outdoor sunlight the view screen is difficult to see the image your taking a picture of.  The view screen should be brighter since there is no view finder to look through in such situations.  The Date/Time setting is lost when the batteries are removed even for a shot time but all other customize setting remain.  Except for the flash setting, it goes to the default setting (OFF) each time the camera is powered off.  There is no shutter cover.The Software:  I already have several photo editing programs and didn't need to install another one from Vivitar.  I did explore its contents to access the owners manual, but it was not available without installing the software.  So I went to Vivitar's website and downloaded the manual.  I have no problems transferring the pics to my computer without the software.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vivitar 7022 - Very nice camera...", "Author": "Louis Ensten", "ReviewID": "R1A3H4W347NDY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I read all the negative links and was amazed at the comments.. You would think this is a devil's device from Hell.. Wrong, wrong, wrong... But, I know what is the problem.. This little guy, unlike the throw-a-ways, is just too  complicated for the average user to comprehend without studying and practice.. Vivitar has incorporated most of the features of their higher end models.. How do you work the camera?? Read the owner's manual.. Woops, what owners manual?? It's on the CD disk.. Oh, but I don't want their software, so who needs the disk?? Catch 22.. Solution, download the owners manual from Vivitar's website (many PDF pages).. My camera takes GREAT still AND shake proof videos.. Very sharp and clear, if you setup the proper mode of focus.. Use lithium aaa batteries for many hundreds of pictures... Yes, there are lots of features I haven't used, yet.. After setting up the basic camera, I have been using the default mode.. Works like a charm... Don't be afraid of this guy because of the low price.. It is very sturdy and feels like quality...", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good -- NOT GREAT!!!", "Author": "Timewarpone", "ReviewID": "R4STRM1UD0UGP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my 11-1/2 y/o daughter. She loves it and it keeps her out of my hair from wanting to use our more expensive($200)camera. The price was cheap enough so I don't have to worry about her losing it. Easy enough for her to use. Comes with a wrist strap, install CD-Rom and USB sync cord if you want to sync your camera to your computer without removing the SD Card. A SD Card is required but NOT included. (I bought a 1gb SD Card for $5.00) She had some questions at first, which of course I helped her with. She loves the sync feature with Facebook. The AAA batteries don't last very long (Especially when you use the flash) so I bought some rechargeable AAA Sanyo eneloop batteries which can be charged 1500 times. The photo quality is very acceptable for a child who is not as critical as an adult. Even she noticed how much better the quality was over her Nintendo DS. My real complaint/s is a small viewing screen that has way to many icons and the battery door is to difficult for her to open. Another flaw is that whenever you turn the camera on and the camera is pre-set to \"AUTO\" exposure, the default flash setting is preset to \"OFF\" or no flash. This means that you have to choose the flash option desired every time you turn the camera on, it can not be pre-set. If the flash is needed for indoor shooting then you have to set the flash option to AUTO or DEDICATED or RED EYE. IF MY CHILD FORGETS TO ACTIVATE THE FLASH FOR INDOOR SHOOTING THEN THE PICS ARE VERY DARK. Also the menus are not that intuitive but like any electronic device sold in the world today there is a learning curve associated with that device. The software is easy to use (Running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit) but the users manual is a .pdf file so Adobe Reader will be needed to view it. This was a pretty good choice for my daughters first camera.

I use the cameras for work photos and tend to ruin about three to four each year.  The cameras take passable photos but not with the quality expected from the megapixels.  It takes some getting used to the flash being off as default and having to turn it on each time the camera is powered up.  Also the flash recovery between shots is quite slow, in the range of 5 seconds.  A set of rechargeable batteries will take about 60-80 flash photos and then need to be replaced.  Obviously, it will take more photos in natural light.  Overall its OK for photos to be included in a written report, but if the photos are the main emphasis then look for another camera.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap, but pictures are horrible quality!", "Author": "ceebee100 \"Cory\"", "ReviewID": "RI0VC0MIIILG8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my 63 yr old mother who has never had a digital camera before and I wanted something simple and cheap that she could just take pictures and email them to me.

I took little over a hundred pictures before I had to change the batteries with my first use. The battery compartment is hard to get into to put batteries in, you have to find a tool to open it, but then you will not have to worry about the batteries falling out either. It is a bit dark when using inside without flash. The video mode seems to require fully charged batteries. It took good enough pictures outside for digital camera, a few times it was a bit hazy, but until I use a better camera this camera I rate it as 4 stars. I hope some day to be able to afford a digital camera that takes better pictures of the moon than this Vivitar 7022. My digital camera moon test: the moon looked hazy.

It went right back with the words \"There is nothing wrong with it other than that it exists.\"  It is rare for me to describe something with such explicit disgust.The packaging is pretty.  That's its only good feature.  The body feels like something one would buy at a Tijuana street merchant with the brand name \"Roleks\".  The shooting is delayed as if on timer--FOR EVERY SHOT, IRRESPECTIVE OF LIGHTING.  But the final--and truly only real--test of any camera is its picture quality.  This camera's 7.1 MP photographs rival the VGA resolution photographs of the earliest camera phones.  I'm really not kidding--its that bad.  How any manufacturer could achieve such poor picture quality from such a high pixel count is difficult to conceive;  I mean you really have to try to make it that bad.

The pictures are grainy, the colors are off and I seriously doubt it being anywhere close to a 7.1 megapixel camera (other than the specs).  It will drain a set of 3 x AAA batteries after about 30 shots or 30 minutes of AVI video.  The menus are difficult to understand and use.
