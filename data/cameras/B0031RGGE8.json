{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good image quality, maddening interface", "Author": "Blade \"Blade\"", "ReviewID": "R3DPI8EXMGG73F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised by the image quality out of this camera.  The lens is sharp and the images it produces are clean, even when viewed at 100% zoom (1:1).  Then there is the interface.  Every time this camera boots up, it goes into Automatic mode, meaning you have to jump through the clunky menu to get to program mode.  Then it forgets your image preferences such as vivid colors.  Why would they not put the option to return to previous mode.... why????In the end, I didn't feel like I needed to click 4-10 times to get me back to the mode I wanted everytime I powered the camera off.  Ridiculous.  Amazon was gracious and took the camera back with no issues.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "kodak", "Author": "kimberly casolino", "ReviewID": "R2MUG6AGHGXMUR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it didn't even last two years. bought it in summer(6/11) and it broke down last month (3/13). very good camera,easy to use, but doesn't last long.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Maybe I just need new parents...", "Author": "Annemarie Long", "ReviewID": "R1GHCXMHBGEWHQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a gift for my parents, who wanted something easy to use.
