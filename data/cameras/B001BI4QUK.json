{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MURS Alert Transmitter", "Author": "TimberrockRanch", "ReviewID": "R2PC3UPH1G8JOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Previously I had purchased an MURS transmitter and receiver kit from a different source and have just now purchased an additional transmitter through Amazon. I may have been less inclined to purchase a Dakota device based on some of the poor performance reviews, especially ingress of water. But, my own experience has been fine so far. After reading a couple of reviews I decided to look into the case of the first transmitter and inspect for water. We have had nearly 5\" of rain in the last few weeks, the unit is exposed on a tree, and there was no water inside. I believe my success is attributed to the one thing I did before I mounted it. Right from the start, I did not like the telescoping antenna, so I replaced it with a cut piece of coax (shield removed for the same length as the extended antenna that came with the unit and leaving the insulation around the center conductor) that is terminated with a male BNC connector. I had put a small amount of silicone caulk around the base of the antenna/center conductor and BNC connector. The coax is not real rigid and sort of flops around, but I like that better than the rigid antenna. My range from transmitter to receiver is about 1400'. Hope this helps others that may have a water problem.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellant New, Deteriorates Rapidly", "Author": "bobf \"bobf\"", "ReviewID": "R1PR56ZUBUEO1P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Over the last couple of years I have bought quite a few Dakota Alert sensors (4 regular, 4 MURS, 2 buried sensors for cars).  These units all worked VERY, VERY well when purchased. Their original range is excellent and it seems even better with the MURS units.  I also bought a hand-held radio to receive alerts from this PIR transmitter and can receive alerts from 500 to 700 feet with at least one hillside in between (line of sight is about 30 to 40 feet into the hillside).  I have set these units as far away as 2500 feet without a clear line of sight (going through a fair number of deciduous trees and a few firs to reach the house), although they only transmit through one wall of the house.As mentioned in the title, their long term reliability has been a problem for me.  Each unit usually lasts 8 to 12 months without a problem then goes downhill very fast.  I live in the PNW where it is VERY wet during the winter (though temps stay moderate).  Earlier units constantly had moisture inside when they failed.  Newer units have a vent hole yet still have condensation and eventually rusting inside.  I have tried covering units with plastic bags and duct tape to no avail.  Also, the antenna (which telescopes) tends to fill with water when it rains as well.The most common failure mode is a constant repeated alert (drives you crazy till you disconnect it).  Often, I have brought the offending unit indoors for several days to dry out and was able to put it back into service for up to several weeks before it died again with the same problem.  I have returned at least 4 units within their one year warranty for this problem and the new units act the same - good for 8-12 months depending on the weather, then recurring problems until they die completely.I have also tried spraying the interior of one unit with Corrosion-X (reputed to work to waterproof electronics without damaging the circuitry by ham operators).  The unit has not worked since I sprayed it :).If you need reliable SHORT-TERM sensors, these are awesome.  If you can't afford the $80 to $200 a year to replace them, then you may want to reconsider.  I have not yet found any other sensor that works as well as these - when they work.  Indoor use, or a method to waterproof the sensors, may also alleviate these problems.bobf", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good idea, poor implementation", "Author": "Eustis", "ReviewID": "RGPVN2ICZJFXU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Dakota has a good concept here, but has not provided the quality needed. Having used these for three years in Northern NH, I have had to send all four units back to the factory for repair or replacement, some more than once, in the warranty period. And they are very sensitive to weather.  Foggy and rainy weather cuts the effective distance down considerably and has caused water penetration around the antenna. Cold weather will sometimes kill a unit.  To Dakota's credit, they repair or replace with no questions asked if the unit is in the warranty period.  Personally, I would prefer a higher quality unit the works without any problems.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "RNOUGDGAWZSRR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a second transmitter since my driveway is quite long.  I get false alarms from wildlife so a second node would confirm, to me, that someone is approaching up the driveway.Once I inserted the batteries, and set the proper channel, it was ready to go.  It was synchronized with the base.  The transmitter is identical to the one that ships with the base unit.  LED can be toggled, degree of sensitivity to objects, and channels can be changed.Aside from securing to a post or tree, there is nothing really to it.  The case is water resistant and snaps in place.  I noticed some light rust along the base of the antenna and a rubber coating may have made it more resistant to the elements.Overall, it's a solid addition to my Dakota system.  If your driveway is quite long (> 025 miles), it helps to have more than one transmitter.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not work in cold weather", "Author": "Fred", "ReviewID": "R1O532D11B70MU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've just purchased and configured two transmitters and found that set up was fairly straightforward.  What is troubling me is that these transmitters just will not work if the outside temperature is below 50 degrees F.  I have reconfigured, set up, moved around these transmitters to over a dozen locations and found that although they work well indoors (warm), they absolutely refuse to work outside in anything under 50 degrees regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.  In my mind, this completely disqualifies these for anything useful outside.Update:  Updated to 3 star from 1 star rating.  After calling Dakota Alert, they asked me to return the transmitters.  They had to replace the sensor board in both and did so without charge.  They were returned to me promptly.. making me wonder if the reseller didn't send me broken devices?

Just bought two more to monitor a back driveway.The two complaints that I see a lot can be easily fixed.1)- the antenna connections and the pull out antenna will not keep out water. I recommend wrapping the antenna joints and the connector at the base in some kind of sealant. I used butyl putty tape from my RV windows but I'm sure there are other options.2)- the AA batteries do not last that long if you get frequent traffic. Mine lasts 6 monts with around 6-8 cars per day. According to other reviews online this product is designed to work on voltages up to around 12v so I just use a small 12V game camera battery and a small solar charger that you can get specifically for them. Drill a hole in the bottom of the housing, run wires through the hole and seal with butyl tape. Never have another dead battery.Note: you can also use a regular weather/police scanner to hear the alerts on multiple frequencies.

However, it will degrade gradually if left exposed to the elements.  The problems arise from its overall design and execution.  Earlier versions of the housing attempted to completely seal the internals but this resulted in certain condensation and degradation of the electronics.  Also at issue was the retractable, metal antenna which would allow water into the housing.  The current version is ventilated via small screens surrounding the antenna mount and also one acting as a drain/vent on the bottom of the housing.  They've also switched to a SMA male rubber duck antenna.  I can follow the logic behind these changes but users still report problems arriving from the relatively open-air environment of the internals.  It's a catch-22 that can only really be solved by much better protected circuits and making the housing an extra layer of protection, not primary.  Dakota seem content with the device largely unchanged so we need a competitor to enter the market or we fix it ourselves:  Buy a marine battery box and roll of silicon pipe sealing/electrical sealing tape, ~$15 for both.  Throw away the lid and mount the transmitter inside the battery box as another layer of protection.  Drill a hole for the antenna and wrap the section protruding with the sealing tape against the top of the battery box.This transmits on all MURS channels and CTCSS tones and transmits at 1.1 watts.  There are three sensitivity/range settings as well.  The voice on this latest iteration is now female, a little more sing-songy, and less matter-of-fact than the male voice on previous versions.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent visitor early warning", "Author": "Incitatus \"Conspicuous Consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R2GYFM48WB19JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works like a charm.
